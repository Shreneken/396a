    "summary": "Because of his eccentric habits and bafflingly strange films, director Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) is a Hollywood outcast. Nevertheless, with the help of the formerly famous Bela Lugosi and a devoted cast and crew of show-business misfits who believe in Ed's off-kilter vision, the filmmaker is able to bring his oversize dreams to cinematic life. Despite a lack of critical or commercial success, Ed and his friends manage to create an oddly endearing series of extremely low-budget films.",

            "content": "\"It wasn't until I saw your movie that I realized I have to take action. Goodbye, penis!\"\n\nTim Burton, a filmmaker that found major commercial success by being offbeat and quirky, makes a reflective, slightly loose biopic on Ed Wood, a filmmaker that found absolutely no success because he was too offbeat and quirky. Like a '50s John Waters that was just born too early to be appreciated, Johnny Depp disappears into a role that doesn't have any of the mannerisms that his more recent work seems to hinge on, but he does have an outsized personality that you can't help but be caught up in even when his character takes every blow straight on the jaw. \n\nImportantly, Ed Wood is not a parody; it would have been easy to take a man that was at one point referred to as 'the worst director of all time' and make him into a feature-length gag reel. Instead, Burton's film (despite apparently taking some liberties with the facts of his protagonist's life) portrays his subject as an idealist beaten back by a system that wanted rigor instead of individuality, the version of Welles that had all of the tragedy but none of the success. The film never punches down for cheap laughs, it's a story of dogged determination told with a love of films and filmmaking even if the main character is a perpetual failure. It certainly helps that Martin Landau is there to provide a contrasting point of view as the former success that had drifted into obscurity (and Landau feels sincere and a bit heartbreaking in the role of Lugosi), but it also helps that the script is very quotable and there are a few gags here and there; Bill Murray's midcentury drag queen and the one-off colorblind cinematographer in a black-and-white movie are both funny bits.\n\nOne of the least-Burton Burton films on the surface, but also one of his most sincere and unique. It's alright to mess with historical fact when it's the spirit of the subject that the film is interested in. (4/5)",

            "content": "This picture is such a good example of the living end of the American sense of humour, it's astonishing that Jud Apatow did not produce it. The basic material is amusing enough: the story of a movie director so pathetically bad that he never even tried to make a good film. Amusing, that is, for about 10 minutes before the real feature begins. Sadly, director Tim Burton is not able to spin out the talentless Ed Wood's forgettable career into a proper movie because of sheer lack of story. The man managed to pull off one ghastly failure after another far into mid-life, when television mercifully put an end to his efforts. The only angle available is his failed attempt to resuscitate the career of Bela Lugosi (Landau), an ancient vampire ham from silent days. Anyone who remembered Landau's comic role in Woody Allen's Crimes & Misdemeanours would not be surprised by Landau's rich comic creation here. But it's wasted on Depp's Ed Wood, who only has two facial expressions: brazen self-confidence and perplexed frown. There must be about half a per cent of the movie-going public that is interested in the basement range of bad films produced in the 1950s, and for them this will be de rigueur, but for everyone else, forget it.",

The editing & pacing are perfect throughout as well moving at a very quick pace never feeling slow. The music is very charming and bizarre as well.  The story is very charming and never exploitive of Ed but really is a message of follow your dreams. While this is not as gothic or nowhere near as violent/crazy as other Tim Burton films this is easily his most accessible and charming one with a lot of care and love telling the story.",

            "content": "This is a surprisingly amusing film. It may make you think initially about what society accepted in the days its set in (the early 1950s). The funniest scenes are those with Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi. Bill Murray is also present as a fairly quirky character. It felt a bit like a parody or satire of b movies at times and it does well at depicting chaotic fime sets.\n\nSome scenes are relatively sad or thought provoking, others more quirky or wacky its fair to say. Ed seemed to be someone who could be quite animated (read overly enthusiastic/excited/annoyingly optimistic and a bit of a fantasist at times). It's made me curious to research the real Ed Wood online.\n\nIt came as no surprise that Tim Burton directed this film - its a typically dark and quirky film, part horror based so its his sort of thing, certainly. I should note this film is filmed in black and white throughout, giving it more of a classic feel, I suppose. The script is witty at times - 'now thats a premiered!' (if you've seen the film/relevant scene, you'll know what this refers to) and 'your the ruler of the galaxy - show a little taste!' being two memorable quotes.\n\nOverall, yes, I'd certainly recommend this film. It may not appeal to everyone but if the titular character sounds at all intriguing then its worth a watch.",

This is just a great movie! I mean, it is. Each cast member does their parts excellently. Martin Landau, who desirably got an Academy Award for his performance, got Bela Lugosi exactly right. I mean, at times I had honestly thought that was Bela Lugosi on screen. Martin Landau does a salute...\u2026.. I SALUTE YOU. I also solute Rick Baker who was also responsible for An American Werewolf in London, the Werewolf TV series, and The Wolf Man remake for his job of making Martin Landau look like Bela Lugosi. The sets look exactly like the old Ed Wood films. The feel of this film is also like a 1950's film\u2026 Also, this film is very quotable. Sure, some of the things are inaccurate as far as things go such as Bela Lugosi cussing like a sailor especially when Karloff is mentioned and Ed Wood never met Orson Welles\u2026\u2026.but I still love those things anyway. I just love this movie.",

From its exhilarating beginning, helped by Howard Shore's brilliant score and Jeffrey Jones's delightful turn as Criswell, it completely gripped me. For me it isn't only one of Burton's better movies, but also one of the better movies of 1994. Tim Burton's works are admittedly strange and offbeat, and while people mayn't like that, I do. And that is why I loved this film, it was funny, it was touching, it was strange(well sort of) and it was offbeat. It is gorgeously shot, with black and white photography that is really a marvel to the eyes, and Burton lovingly directs. The script is funny and poignant, and the restoration of Wood's productions are astonishing. It was even nice to see Plan 9 From Outer Space, I know that critics cite it as the worst movie ever made, but there are other people who consider it as a \"so bad it's good\" movie, the way I have heard people talk about the film, whether they love or hate it, is quite fascinating. And the performances are brilliant; Johnny Depp is amazing as Ed Wood, portraying him as an optimist and an \"anguished cross-dresser\", and Martin Landau is absolutely superb as Bela Lugosi. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are alluring and convincing as Delores and Kathy, and as Bunny Bill Murray does well even if Bunny could've been developed a little more. Overall, gripping, funny, touching and brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

While it would be helpful to have seen Wood's body of work before watching Burton's offering in order to fully understand all of the references, Ed Wood stands on its own thanks to a witty script, effective black and white cinematography from Stefan Czapsky, and sound performances from the entire cast, including Johnny Depp as Ed Wood and Martin Landau in an Oscar-winning performance as Bela Lugosi.",

Depp more than embraces Woods infectious charisma which gifted the real Wood the majority of his collaborators.

And of course, the acting is terrific! Johnny Depp is absolutely loveable as the titular disaster artist, he really brings him back to life. And Martin Landau also indeed did deserve that Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, for playing an old, washed up Bela Lugosi. It's a film that can be very sad and funny at the same time.

Seeing this dramatization of the process that went into making things like Plan 9 from Outer Space gave me the idea that it might be worthwhile to suffer through one or two of his movies (and possibly enjoy a little chuckle at the finished product.) What\u2019s truly marvelous about Ed Wood, is that it lifts up the titular director and presents him as someone admirable with a dream. He\u2019s not a completely unrelatable mad man, he\u2019s just a likable guy who is a bit odd. Tim Burton never seems interested in stomping on the grave of this man, instead he respects him as a fellow director with a vision, even if the finished product of that vision was awful. That\u2019s not to say that this movie shies away from the comedy of Ed Wood\u2019s directing style. It is constantly pointing a spotlight on his ridiculous decisions, including how he was forced to cut corners while begging, borrowing, and stealing what he needed to get the job done. The performances of many people in the cast are downright farcical. Johnny Depp and Bill Murray in particular feel like they are constantly going for a laugh. I appreciated that Depp never lost the character, though. His undaunted exuberance was exactly what we needed from this man who thinks anything is possible even when he is constantly proven wrong. The truly masterful performance, is the one everyone talks about from Martin Landau. His portrayal of the elderly Bela Lugosi is hilarious, but also authentic. I often thought Depp was a bit over-the-top, but Landau always seemed dialed in and presented Lugosi as a very relatable and tragic figure. Unlike many of Tim Burton\u2019s other films, I felt that Ed Wood had a decent amount of substance instead of always valuing style first. I\u2019m not sure how much of this film reflected actual history, but I don\u2019t particularly care. It never felt like this was intended to be a documentary, so taking liberties is welcome. In fact, it\u2019s almost like Burton used some of Ed Wood\u2019s style of film-making in order to make a film about him, which is a cool meta concept. I wish I laughed a little more, or that there was a real ending to the film, but the overall movie is a good one.",

I can't help but think that maybe a part of this Ed character is actually Burton when he was just starting out in the movie business. Probably no one wanted anything to do with him because his material was \"weird\". \n\nAn actor's dying legacy that will continue to live on through his work, a director trying to make it and immortalize a once legend. What's funny is that he doesn't even realize how shitty his movie production and acting is in his movies. The message is to just go after your dreams and ambitions. \n\nVery charming and satirical movie that pokes fun of shitty monster movies that were made in the 40's and 50's.

I also enjoyed the \"movie within a movie\" aspect that it had. Being a part of the film industry, I could certainly relate to the struggles and difficulties that Ed faced getting his films financed and seen. I found myself really rooting for him and rooting for his success. There was also another aspect to the film that I empathized with which was that at the end of the day Ed just wanted to be loved and accepted for who he was, which was something that he finally found with Kathy. I wouldn't necessarily say that the film felt to be a success. It certainly didn't feel to be a failure, but I didn't find it to necessarily be anything above and beyond in any particular way. I did enjoy that it was about an actual filmmaker and found it to be disappointing to hear of how his career progressed beyond the timeline of the film.

Burton clearly has a love, respect, and reverence for Ed Wood the man, artist, and director which shows on the screen. Lit in gorgeous black and white lighting, Ed Wood is a biopic of the highest caliber. We get to see all the notable moments and films in Wood's life and career.  Burton may have directed bigger movies, but none compare to the noir inspired biopic Ed Wood!\n\nYou will laugh as the hilarious script filled with memorable one liners. The line delivery from the actors is gut busting as each character is more zany than the last. The serious tone and cinematography style just contribute to Burton's complete and detailed recreating of old Hollywood. The atmosphere is so real it hurts and Ed Wood struggles to get his terrible films financed.\n\nYou will love the subtle and nuanced score from Howard Shore. Shore's soundtrack beautifully accompanies the funny moments in Ed Wood as well as the more serious and depressing aspects. Themes of dreams, love, inspiration, addiction, death, and failure are all on full display in Ed Wood.\n\nNow, as for the acting, Ed Wood is stacked with an apt cast who all deliver genuinely brilliant performances. First of all, Johnny Depp is perfect as director Ed Wood. His enthusiasm for filmmaking is infectious. Depp accurately portrays Wood's peculiarities and charisma with a daft charm. He simultaneously captures the allure of directing with the gross incompetence of Wood's own failures. He is funny to laugh at, and yet, you will also be rooting for him to succeed despite his lack of directorial skill. It's Wood's vision that you want to see made because of Depp's loving caricature of Ed Wood.\n\nSimilarly, Martin Landau is so convincing as legendary actor Bela Lugosi. Landau captures Legosi's oddities and addiction with a gentle hand and a humorous take. Landau has all the gravitas of an old screen icon every time he walks on set. You are drawn to his presence, amused by his jokes, and moved by his genuinely brilliant dramatic acting. This is an all time great acting performance by Landau!\n\nFurthermore, Ed Wood boasts a massive cast of quirky characters, all of whom, you will adore. Sarah Jessica Parker gives her best acting as Dolores Fuller. Parker plays sweet, funny, and frustrated with a sweet fury. This is honestly Parker's greatest role along with Footloose or Hocus Pocus. Certainly Parker's most sincere acting is contained within Ed Wood's cinematic confines. Then, Patricia Arquette plays the most sweet woman on screen named Kathy O'Hara. You will love her dearly.\n\nAdditionally, Bill Murray is hilariously as the hopeful transgender man and friend to Ed Wood. Jeffrey Jones is funny and quite articulate as Criswell the pseudo psychic. I must mention the giant man George \"The Animal\" Steele playing Tor Johnson is hilariously incomprehensible and clumsy. His massive stature hides his grounded take on Tor quite well. Lastly, the cameo roles of Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Welles and Rance Howard are perfectly realistic. Overall, Ed Wood's cast is wonderful from top to bottom.\n\nIn all, Ed Wood will persevere as Tim Burton's greatest film by far. As more audiences find out about this movie, the masses will be astonished by its peerless direction, fine craftsmanship, inspired casting, time period accuracy, funny lines, and genius acting. Ed Wood will be one of your favorite films once you see it!",

It would be an inspirational piece on believing in yourself - if not for the movie's ultimate pessimism. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton's most mature and ambitious effort to date.\n\nWhy do we keep creating art, even when the world tells us to stop? Because it's the only thing we know how to do! Tim Burton's tribute to the worst filmmaker of all time is not a parody. It is an homage to a filmmaker whose talent wasn't missing-it was just alien. There is something inspiring about a filmmaker who is willing to destroy his career to create something he believes in. Like Tod Browning's Freaks (another memorable film) Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films were less about creating entertainment, and more about a troubled artist working through his issues through the magic of cinema. There's something even more inspiring about Tim Burton getting the point of Ed Wood's life and making a poignant biopic about it.\n\nWhat I Learned: Really helped me to understand that the process of writing, art, and creating is the real joy in life. Orson Welles started at the top and worked his way to the bottom. Ed Wood worked himself to the bottom and lower to the basement. But he never lost the joy of his art. He was bulletproof and had an unquenchable optimism that was strong enough to survive criticism, mockery, and postmodern love-mockery. Regardless of whether his movies sucked or not, Ed Wood was an artist. Because an artist creates art until he dies, and he enjoys every thankless moment of it.",

But in all seriousness, Ed Wood may very well be the best directing job of Burton's career.  It's funny, strange, and rapidly paced.  Burton deserves credit.\n\nI really love when movies take place within the world of filmmaking, especially during the 1950's.  It was just an interesting time to be involved in the film business.  Perhaps nobody more interesting than Edward D. Wood Jr.  Although apparently much of the film's details were made up for the movie itself, it's hard not to get a kick out of Wood's story.  A man stumbles himself into Hollywood with little to no experience, and manages to garner decent budgets to make multiple films, that's Hollywood 101.\n\nOne of Burton's greatest qualities is the ability to develop a great journey for the characters.  Ed Wood has a clear beginning, middle, and end, but it's the stuff along the way that makes for the most entertainment.  The sheer absurdity of Wood's story is really where Burton tends to bring out his best work.  Watching a man without any real talent as a filmmaker plow his way through studio executives and convince actors to join him in his quest makes it all the more amazing.  I mean come on, this guy compares himself to Citizen Kane on multiple occasions.\n\nAs for the performances, there's almost too many good ones to mention.  Johnny Depp, in his second Burton feature, begins to show exactly why he's one of this generation's greatest talents.  He easily could have been nominated for an Oscar here.  It's also the first real time he played such a uniquely strange character, something he's got himself stuck into doing these days.  Martin Landau, who did win an Oscar for his turn as Bela Lugosi, is what makes this film work so well.  It can get tiresome watching Wood's undeserved success, but Landau works so impeccably well as a drugged up Lugosi.  I couldn't have imagined someone better in that role.\n\nThe rest of the cast and crew also deserve credit, mostly for succeeding in making such a strangely delicious film.  After a while, you begin to go along with the joke of Wood's career.  And to look up and see that there's still plenty that isn't falsified makes it all the better.\n\n+Unique characters and story\n\n+Movie about movies\n\n+Burton's tight directing\n\n8.0/10",

Forward he endlessly marches, procuring has-been celebrities and clueless investors through sheer force of will and personality, all in the quest to become the next Orson Welles. Which, of course, is like buying a can of bug spray and expecting it to serve as a dessert topping.\n\nJohnny Depp is a great, big, overinflated bag of optimistic energy in the title role, half carnival barker and half renaissance man, but he's overshadowed by a heartbreaking turn from Martin Landau as a struggling, drug-addicted, late-life Bela Lugosi who somehow gets wrapped up in Wood's little world. Landau won a surprising Best Supporting Actor award for this take, well-deserved as he projects all manner of emotion to an unsuspecting audience and towers over every scene in which he appears. Bill Murray is also fabulous in a very small, nearly-pointless role, which surely deserved further exploration. Alas, at just over two hours, there wasn't time to get to everything.\n\nOne of Tim Burton's best, most restrained films, bubbling and churning with his own brand of black, twisted humor, but also much more controlled and traditional than his more definitive films (say, Beetlejuice or The Nightmare Before Christmas). Energetic, entertaining, funny and poignant and tolerant, it touches a whole lot of emotions with impressive delicacy, and its deep ruminations on acceptance remain particularly relevant in a modern setting.",

Landau not only is spot on but also actually, creates a very complex and emotionally driving portrayal of Lugosi that makes it much more than any old impersonation, I didn't see an actor playing Lugosi, I saw Lugosi himself in this performance and I think this is something truly magical about this film.

Behind the camera, Burton mimics the style of Ed Wood's film perfectly, making his most original & stylish film while showing the love that goes into movie making.

My desire to learn more about certain historical figures, this case being Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) and Bela Lugosi (Martin Landeau), can blind me from judging the merits of the movie as a movie. I'll try to articulate my judgment simply: I grew up on Mystery Science Theater 3000, and through that show, I fell in love with B-movies. I was very familiar with the works of Ed Wood, when going into this movie. I was delighted by how much passion that Ed Wood had for his preposterous cinematic vision, and horrified by how little hope that Bela Lugosi had left in his final years of cinematic presence. Depp and Landeau presented themselves as desperate movie lovers, and, with the bizarre touches of Tim Burton (other than Schindler's List, there weren't and aren't many mainstream movies coming out in B&W), the story was surprisingly brought to heartwarming life. This is definitely one of Burton's most restrained works. Without anything supernatural at work, one's attention falls less on the special effects or set design (at best, the recreation of the minimal budget work that Ed Wood himself could barely afford), and more on character and story development. Good on Tim Burton for trying something new. Where many of his other films would sometimes delude how we saw its own characters, Ed Wood (the movie) doesn't cloud anything. We see Wood struggle to embrace his gender-swapping behaviours, as well as his \"avant-garde\" style of filmmaking. And so, looking at the story as another tale of self-acceptance may make one wonder, \"Who cares about Ed Wood?\" I must stress how his achievement of self-acceptance had never led to him being hailed as a genius. Ed Wood is still seen as an artistic loser, one of the worst film directors of all time. Yet, as shown in the scenes of the making of Plan 9 from Outer Space, he fought his superiors to the very end so that he could make what he wanted to make. Even more perplexing was how much his cast and crew believed in him. Maybe everyone knew it was crap, and they still wanted Ed Wood to win. I wanted Wood to win too. Clearly, Burton loved his fair share of B-movies, even framing the story as if it were an Ed Wood movie. As a fan work, as a biopic, and as a drama with stylistic, deadpan touches, Ed Wood is a winner.",

Set in the 1950s, Wood makes films with a star named Bela Lugosi, (Martin Landau in his Oscar-winning role), a horror movie star who played Dracula and then decided to be in Ed Wood's movie Glen or Glenda. Ed likes to dress ain women's clothing, which is weird, but hilarious. He never let bad reviews or studio executives try to stop his big screen dreams of becoming a great director just like his inspiration: Orson Welles from Citizen Kane. \n\nWith fantastic makeup, costume design and great acting and directing and an all star cast, including Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette, and Sarah Jessica Parker, Ed Wood is another Tim Burton masterpiece!

This is a fantastic film, it has great acting, great writing, great direction and overall a very enjoyable film that I really didn't want to end as I was finding it so interesting. Johnny depp is fantastic as Ed Wood, bringing a special something to the review that I really doubt any other actor could have. Edward D wood Jr. is such a fascinating character and I really feel they explored as much of his character as possible. True he was a terrible director but he was so committed to his directing career, unlike someone like Brett Ratner who just seems like he's in it for the paycheck, Ed Wood was in it for the fun of directing. Whenever one of his films got bad reception, Ed would just shake it off and move on to try and make his next movie even better. I just love this character, true he might be romanticised but he's still a very interesting character. Overall this is one of Tim Burton's best films and while I don't think it's quite as good as Edward Scissorhands I still think it's a fantastic film. A-.",

            "content": "Such a great film, but an unfortunate box office bomb.  Based off Rudolph Grey's book Nightmare of Ecstasy, Ed Wood is a comedy-drama biopic centered on the title character during the 1950's as he tries to make films after making a poorly-received play, but his films are panned, yet he refuses to give up, despite the fact it's affecting him and his friends and family personally and financially.  Ed Wood dives deeply into the character as he does his best to finance his films, as well as make them true works of art for audiences, and handling the issues given to him due to decisions made by him and/or the studios he's trying to sell his films to.  There's also the background of him and his companions and business partners, giving them quality and much-needed characterization.  Unfortunately, like many, if not all biopics, there is always historical inaccuracies, including this one, which changes a few minor or major events, but is barely an issue as the film is very well-made thanks to the right crew, who also include the much-needed epilogue in order to stay up to date with events.  Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, who wrote the script while they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, follow his life with a few flaws, but succeed at capturing the right moments and transitions.  Tim Burton also finds the right background and setting for each scene, and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky's use of black-and-white bring backs memories of 50's media, especially movies, which is what Ed Wood was devoted to his whole life.  The film also implements bits of Burton's and Wood's style of filmmaking, which includes bizarre elements, and awful dialogue and filmmaking when Ed's film footage is shown.  What also works is Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ed Wood, who captures his attitude, compassion, effort, and love of wearing women's clothing as his mother wanted a girl, forcing her to dress him in women's clothes.  The best performance comes from Martin Landau as the great Bela Lugosi, who played Dracula, and started in many Ed Wood films, and for his work, Landau won an Oscar to prove he did what was necessary to win.  The characters are hard to recognize thanks to the stellar makeup by Rick Bauer, Ve Neill, and Yolanda Toussieng, who all won an Oscar for their work.  Howard Shore also gives a great score that conveys the mood of every scene at the right time.  The film is both funny and thought-provoking, and transitions from comedy to drama at the right moments, thus showcasing quality filmmaking.  Knowing this flopped at the box-office despite massive critical acclaim is sad, as it's touching and powerful throughout, with strong contributions to Ed Wood.  A must-see, and one of the best collaborations between Depp and Burton.",

The fifties sci-fi and horror film director who basically have been called everything from the most incompetent filmmaker of all time to an oblivious avant-gardist and misunderstood poet. The story starts with Edward D. Wood Jr as a struggling young screenwriter and director who is having trouble to find a studio willing to finance his first picture, when a film about the controversial topic of sex change comes to his attention. Ed desperately tries to convince the producer that he is the best man for the job on the grounds that he's a cross-dresser, but is rejected. Later that same day Ed has a run in and forms a friendship with the out of work acting legend, Bela Lugosi, a former horror-star with a severe morphine addiction. He returns to the studio and offers to get them Lugosi for their sex change film if he's allowed to direct and filming of the first, Edward Wood Jr, film Glen or Glenda begins.\r\n\r\nEd Wood is a very rare film in many ways and not the average type of character study. It only depicts the rise, if you might call it that and not really any fall or many downs. Ed wood as a character is dealt with in a very comedic and lighthearted fashion making it the ultimate feel-good film. The fascinating friendship between Ed and Lugosi take as big a part of the story as the career of Ed and the two characters are brought to life through incredible performances from Johnny Depp and Martin Landau. The supporting cast is a solid bunch consisting of Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey Jones, George Steele, Max Casella, Brent Hinkley and Bill Murray. Costuming and makeup are both perfectly done to resemble the fifties and the film is shot in very atmospheric black and white intended to mirror Ed Wood's own films. Tim Burton probably decided to direct this film out of true admiration for the cult-filmmakers passion and loyalty to his vision, which really sets the tone for the entire film and sends the message that even the most popular filmmakers today have something to learn from this small time director of cheap b-movies.",

            "content": "Whether you admire or hate his work, you have to admit one thing about Ed Wood and that he had a pure passion in making movies. During my first day in Radio & Television class at Delta College, my teacher at the time Mr. Atwood said something that I will never forget. \"There are many types of directors when it comes to making film and the lowest of the low are the Ed Wood types.\" From that moment on I had to find out who he was and what kind of movies he made. Sure enough I was in for quite the surprise when I saw his movies. Ed Wood had been labeled as the worst director of all time, but I think he was certainly the most eccentric. This guy was a rebel who made movies in Hollywood, but outside of the Hollywood making establishment. He independently produced his own movies, wrote, directed, and sometimes even starred in them. His methods were always making movies that were super fast and super cheap resulting in some of the worst movies ever made. I will admit that his movies are bad, and sometimes even bizarre, but they are not THE WORST movies of all time and believe me I have seen some pretty awful films that were a lot worse than his. Because of his work, future filmmakers have admired Ed Wood's work making him and his movies cult classics. So when I heard that one of his biggest fans, Tim Burton, decided to make a movie about him I had to see. Sadly I never got around to watching it until a couple of days ago. I can see why someone like Tim Burton would make a movie about Ed wood because he is an eccentric person as well who always liked making films about a rebel.\n\nTim Burton was the perfect choice to do a biopic on Ed Wood mostly because these two have a lot in common and that Burton understands Wood's work. The movie chronicles around making Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and Plan 9 from Outer Space. It showcases the struggles that he had to go through and his persistence to get these movies made despite the terrible odds against him. It is a perfect balance of how they make fun of him and celebrate him which balances the line between comedy and drama. Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood and is absolutely fantastic as being both funny and sympathetic. Martin Landau plays Bela Lugosi and won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this movie and it is rightfully so. He was absolutely flawless as the character and you start to forget that he isn't Bela Lugosi, but it is also out of character when he spews out curses. The production design was brilliant and the black & white is gorgeous. The opening movie begins with a lot of homages to Ed Wood's work with a creepy old house, to a cemetery that has the cast names are etched into cheap gravestones from Plan 9, and even stock footages of octopuses and flying saucers. It is one of the best opening scenes ever. The music in here is pretty well done capturing that 1950's theme. The movie scenes go to perfectly replicating the exact same scenes from the Ed Wood movies and it is affectionly done with perfect detail. It also has hauntingly great music motifs like every time they show a sad Lugosi scene you hear Swan Lake which was used in the opening of the original Dracula movie. Overall, this is an uplifting movie that makes you feel good in the end. However it may not be a perfect factual movie, but it is mostly true to Ed Wood and it is inspirational to anyone who wants to go into film making as their life's ambition. Not only do I give this a perfect five star rating, but I will declare that this is one of my Top Ten Movies of all time.",

The film follows Wood (Johnny Depp) in his quest for film greatness as he writes and directs turkey after turkey, cross-dresses, and surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, outcasts, has-beens, and never-weres. The real story, however, is his friendship with aging, morphine-addicted Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whom he tries to help stage a comeback.\nMy Review\nJust by the character of Ed Wood and the films he made I guess anyone can probably tell why I decided to see this movie. Why? Because he was considered as one of the worst directors of all time and anyone who wants to be in the film business or enjoys films should really take an interest in seeing this film.\nThe Film revolves around Ed Wood who wants to direct movies, and that's what he does. He writes the scripts,produces the film, and directs. It's a biopic on who was and the movie's he directed and how they were shot, and produced.\nIn the opening sequence you get an awesome score for this film that is done by Howard shore and it shows parts and cuts of what Ed Wood used in his movie's like Plan 9 from outer space. We later cut to Ed wood trying to get a studio to let him direct a movie called Glen or Glenda which is critically panned and is known as to one person in the film as the worst film he has ever seen why in fact the worse film of all time. Ed wood later in the beginning of the film meets one of the famous stars of all time Bela Lugosi.\nThe things i like about this motion picture are the relationship between Ed Wood and his friend Bela Lugosi while they make there movie together Ed would always give him to catch his breath or take a nap. Lugosi would ask Ed when are we making another picture, because as they made more movies they became better and better friends. Johnny Depp gives the best performance of his career as Ed Wood and everyone does just a good a job as he does like Bill Murrary, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jeffery Jones, and Lisa Marie. The direction by Tim Burton is absolutely amazing and I honestly think this is his best live action film.

As one of his 8 collaborations in his bro-mance with Tim Burton, he shines with an utterly wacky and unsettling character who was more than interesting enough to make a biopic about.  Martin Landau matches Depp scene for scene, receiving a well deserved Oscar for his role.  Ultimately, the story is secondary to the man himself, and whether or not you agree with his filmmaking opinions or his \"lifestyle\" choices, he inevitably has heart and keeps life unpredictable.  Ed Wood himself isn't delved into or broken down as much as we may have hoped, but all the details are there and you more than leave the theatre contemplating looking for his famously bad movies online.",

This is his real life for real, Ed Wood has been considered to be one of the \"worst directors of all time\" in Hollywood history.

Wood Jr. who never realized his flaws and just got his movies made just for the sake of himself as a movie director. He was a big fan of Dracula star Bela Lugosi and gave him his comebacks to three films which were Glen Or Glenda, Bride Of The Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space before he died. These movies were what had started the chain of worst movies in cinema history. Ed Wood was secretly a transvestite because his mum wanted a girl and therefore dressed him up in her clothes which gave him the idea for Glen Or Glenda. He then meets wrestler Tor Johnson and an actress named Vampira to star in Bride Of The Monster which was a huge failure and Plan 9 From Outer Space which grew a cult hit. After his failure, Ed Wood meets his inspiration Orson Welles, the director of Citizen Kane who teaches him the lesson that grants Ed Wood the success for Plan 9 From Outer Space. This movie is an amazing biopic directed by the legendary Tim Burton who has explored his creativity even through the eyes of a historical biopic. Johnny Depp was great as Ed Wood and the whole film is supposed to be watched from the lead hero's point of view and that's what makes this movie so great. Ed Wood gets a 10/10.",

Johnny Depp is fun as Wood, but Martin Landau excels even more as the tragic Lugosi, afflicted by drug addiction in his twilight years. Landau went on to deservedly win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his sympathetic portrayal of the once mesmerizing horror legend.  Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski's screenplay deftly balances absurdity and heartfelt drama, and Stefan Czapsky's black & white cinematography along with Coleen Atwood's costumes and Tom Duffield's production design are highly evocative of the time and place Ed Wood's early films were shot.

The film follows Wood (Johnny Depp) in his quest for film greatness as he writes and directs turkey after turkey, cross-dresses, and surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, outcasts, has-beens, and never-weres. The real story, however, is his friendship with aging, morphine-addicted Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whom he tries to help stage a comeback. \nMy Review\nJust by the character of Ed Wood and the films he made I guess anyone can probably tell why I decided to see this movie. Why? Because he was considered as one of the worst directors of all time and anyone who wants to be in the film business or enjoys films should really take an interest in seeing this film.\nThe Film revolves around Ed Wood who wants to direct movies, and that's what he does. He writes the scripts,produces the film, and directs. It's a biopic on who was and the movie's he directed and how they were shot, and produced.\nIn the opening sequence you get an awesome score for this film that is done by Howard shore and it shows parts and cuts of what Ed Wood used in his movie's like Plan 9 from outer space. We later cut to Ed wood trying to get a studio to let him direct a movie called Glen or Glenda which is critically panned and is known as to one person in the film as the worst film he has ever seen why in fact the worse film of all time. Ed wood later in the beginning of the film meets one of the famous stars of all time Bela Lugosi. \nThe things i like about this motion picture are the relationship between Ed Wood and his friend Bela Lugosi while they make there movie together Ed would always give him to catch his breath or take a nap. Lugosi would ask Ed when are we making another picture, because as they made more movies they became better and better friends. Johnny Depp gives the best performance of his career as Ed Wood and everyone does just a good a job as he does like Bill Murrary, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jeffery Jones, and Lisa Marie. The direction by Tim Burton is absolutely amazing and I honestly think this is his best live action film. Ed Wood is a very underrated motion picture that i think is a masterpiece and get's the final rating of five out of five.",

Here, Tim Burton looks at all the various and strange different aspects and the character's genuine struggles for his 'art' as well as giving us an intimate look at his friendship with Bela Lugosi, who starred in some of his movies. The portrait given by Burton is a surreal work of love with plenty of the same irony and comedy that seems to be inspired by the b-movie style of the films that Ed Wood himself shot (although here the effect is intentional), but it is also strikingly touching and intimate. The performances given by Johnny Depp as Ed Wood and Landau as Bela Lugosi are simply superb. A strange work of love and admiration, with a final irony that a film about the worst filmmaker of all time may well be regarded as one of the best films of all time.",

Thus I was interested to see a bit older black and white comedy from Burton which pays homage to one of the worse movie directors of all time, Ed Wood. \n\nWood is renown from his sub-par 1950s horror films such as the \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" which by many is considered _the_ worse film ever made. As expected for a tittle film, much of the running time is spent demonstrating the directors rather \"unique\" style of film directing, which in turn explains why Wood's films are terrible. In addition, the film gives plenty of screen time for the odd group of friends that Ed Wood surrounded himself and to the directors quite curious trait of dressing in women's clothing. Adding all the above together and you have a rather odd (in a good way) comedy film at hand.  \n\nA semi-biography film requires a strong lead actor and the director's choice of Johnny Depp to portray Ed Wood is mostly successful. From comedy aspect, Depp's quirky depiction of Ed Wood is funny enough, but later in the film his constant bedazzlement and craziness starts to grow old. Also the first quarter of the film is just downright boring, but luckily the pace picked up afterwards. Despite the boring start and Depp's act turning repetitive towards the end, overall I enjoyed the film; it is bit crazy and far outside the mainstream, but in a good way.",

Burton abandons much of his typical style for this feature, and it wins big for him.
