    "summary": "Six-year-old Susan Walker (Mara Wilson) is skeptical of the Christmas myth surrounding Santa Claus, a trait she perhaps learned from her mother, Dorey (Elizabeth Perkins). When tasked with hiring the Santa who will pose with kids at Macy's, Dorey enlists a man with the curious name of Kris Kringle (Richard Attenborough) who claims to be Santa himself. His assertions are met with scoffs and threats of institutionalization, but a young lawyer, along with Susan and Dorey, comes to his defense.",

            "content": "The original 1947 version was pretty close to perfect.  So I find this a needless remake.  That lame excuse of \"Updating it for a younger generation\" is bullshit.  The younger needs to know history.  So heaven forbid they watch something BEFORE they were born, it's a dumb excuse to remake an IP they already own.  Hell, this even the first remake.  The idea of making a competing store an antagonist was a strange choice.  Plus making the DA a corrupt dick was not needed.  Plus there are a couple of retcons I wasn't crazy about without going into SPOILERS, so I won't.  But good performances and has some fun elements.  As needless remakes go, this is still pretty good.  Watch the original first then check this out too.  But you will the original is far superior.",

While I enjoy the humor and acting from Richard Attenborough and Mara Wilson, I thought the film overall was not properly executed. The way I can describe this film was said perfectly by Macy's. Macy's said that the original Miracle on 34th Street \"stands on its own and could not be improved upon\". Personally, I wholeheartedly agree.",

Mara Wilson was wonderful as the child and the supporting cast makes the movie very charming and tender. It is very comical and heartwarming and the ending will awake your Christmas spirit in the most magical way. But apparently, the older original film is the best and the most magical.",

            "content": "I remember when I first saw this version of the classic Christmas film, I kind of resented it because there didn’t seem to be any logical reason to remake this story, since it was relatively timeless. However, over time I warmed up to the modern Miracle on 34th Street, and I think I rate them about the same. One of the biggest reasons that this film works so well is the cast. For starters, Richard Attenborough is delightful as Kris Kringle. He has a magical air to his performance that feels like he is perfectly embodying this benevolent spirit of Santa Claus. Likewise, Mara Wilson is the perfect precocious little girl. She is able to play both the over-serious child her mother made her, and then seamlessly transition into the joyous child who is free to believe in miracles. Elizabeth Perkins plays the loving mother who also might be a bit too serious for her daughter’s good, and Dylan McDermott is great as the fun-loving friend who can also become a decent lawyer when needed. The other thing that I’ve always said is necessary to make a good remake is to bring something new or different to the story. This is because, if you’re going to just make the same film what is the point? Well, I’m not sure if Miracle on 34th Street quite follows through on that aspect, so I should hate it. There are some tweaks, though. For instance, I appreciated that they dropped a few of the extraneous characters from the original film, and developed the relationship between the romantic leads a bit more. Since the courtroom stuff in both films is ludicrous, I like that this version presses it even further as they explore how the prosecutor would try to prove the impossibility of Santa Claus’ existence. And I think this movie makes an interesting choice in the way it changes up the ending. I totally understand people who are purists and say that the 1947 Miracle on 34th Street is all they need. However, I find just enough to like about this 1994 film that I’ll gladly watch either at Christmastime.",

It's actually worked rather well for A Star is Born and some have even gone on to overshadow the original such as Scarface and The Thing. The '90s remake of the iconic Christmas movie of the '40s can be regarded as falling under the latter camp. True, it's sentimental and sometimes even a bit far-fetched but I do think the movie can get people into the Christmas spirit. Richard Attenborough is likable as Kris Kringle and the courtroom stuff has me rooting for the jolly fella. I do like how things are kept vague as to whether or not, he IS the real deal. And the rest of the actors do a good job. I actually don't know how to convey just how much I found the movie to have its problems but is decidedly UNlacking in merits so I'll just say that this version of Miracle on 34th Street is an above-average Christmas movie that is suitable for the whole family, even without having seen the 1947 original.",

It's not patronising or condescending, but it panders to its target audience while doing little to challenge them. Richard Attenborough makes for a great Santa: Charming, warm and full of cheer. But the supporting cast, with the possible exception of an underused Mara Wilson, never comes to life or even seem very invested in what they're doing. There's a romantic subplot that pops up now and then and is never interesting, and there's a pair of baddies who are supposed to be comic relief but are never funny. More than anything the film is just forced and forgettable. It goes on about 20 minutes too long, and has an ending which exists solely to force as many sentimentalities down our throats as possible. Definitely not a Christmas classic, and not a film I'm keen to revisit when the festive season rolls around again.",

I hadn't seen it in a good number of years since my childhood days and when faced with the choice of purchasing this film or the original on Blu Ray, I decided on this version simply because it was familiar and I wanted to see how it held up. Unfortunately my memory did not serve me well as this movie is not at all the joyous perfect Christmas film I remembered. The aspects I enjoyed include the actual character of Kriss Kringle played by Richard Attenborough and the cheesiness of it. The concept was also interesting even if the result of the final court room was a bit ridiculous. The idea of Santa in this movie legit being a simple crazy old man who just happens to believe he is Santa Claus is super interesting to think about once the credits roll. Other than this though, the rest of the movie falls flat. The conflict with the main company that hires Mr. Kringle, Cole's, and their business competitor was forgettable. The child character of Susan was annoying and off putting as the delivery of many of her lines and the writing of her script sometimes made her seem like a child genius and other times like a normal little girl. It was just very awkward. I didn't buy the romance of Bryan and Dorey whatsoever and the actual character if Dorey just ended up feeling so bland, boring, and annoying that it really drags the movie down even though it is a major focal point. Overall, I don't recommend seeing this as an annual Christmas film, sigh, maybe the original will give me more hope if I watch that next year.",

I like the actors in it, which Richard Attenborough is the perfect actor to play Santa Claus in that time period which I'm glad that he's even in this because he saves this film a bit. Mara Wilson is fine, but she made me feel a bit annoyed with the way that she say such big words that are not the right age for her to say, which I'm glad that they addressed that a bit. The writing by John Hughes is fine, but the way it was executed made me felt a bit frustrated about where it was going, except when Santa shows up which gets me interested. The court scenes are a bit funny to watch and entertaining too. The movie sort of makes Santa the main focus which I'm fine with, and I didn't really care that much about the family's problems.

It's pretty good, but doesn't match the greatness of the original. There were a few things, of course, that I didn't like.\nLike the original, it follows a department store santa with the coincidental name Kris Kringle. But here's the catch: the department store isn't Macy's. I guess because they didn't want to break copyright infringement, they had to make up some department store and came up with \"Cole's\". Sounds a lot like the actual store Kohl's, right? A worker at Cole's is Doris Walker, whose daughter Susan doesn't believe in Santa Claus and knows the truth because Doris believes the truth is more important than anything, including letting your daughter down. Like the original, Doris dates a guy who somehow is close friends with the family after a divorce named Bryan. People think Kris is crazy because he believes he is the actual Santa Claus. After hitting a man with his cane, Kris is sent to prison and his trial is sent to court with none other than Bryan as his lawyer. Since this is a happy Christmas family movie, Kris is proven to not be insane and the film leaves off on a happy ending.\nNot perfect, but not too shabby. The fact that John Hughes wrote the screenplay makes me feel like this isn't even close to being one of his best works, but then again this is the same guy who also wrote the 3rd Home Alone. A time-consuming waste is the numerous flirting scenes between Doris and Bryan. This is a Christmas film, not a chick flick. The character Bryan Bedford has no personality except being laid back and acting like he's a tough guy. Bryan's character in the 1947 film was Fred Gayley, so why not just use that name? Is the name Fred too '40s enough for the film that they had to use a name that most likely would be used for a boy band member? I should probably quit ranting over little things, but this isn't the best film and it's just an excuse for people to go all cutesy over Mara Wilson.",

Although this one isn't as bad as the 1973 version, it still has so many things wrong with it. A big problem being Mara Wilson's acting. I have nothing against Mara Wilson or her acting, but it just doesn't fit the role of Susan at all. Her major thing in the movie is looking adorable and innocent. We're supposed to feel sorry for her, because, boo hoo, her mother says there's no such thing as Santa Clause. That's completely inaccurate. In the original, Susan (Natalie Wood) was confident in herself and in her beliefs. Even though she adopted her points of view from her mother, she still firmly believed in them and it took a \"miracle\" for her to even doubt them. Mara Wilson, on the other had, is too child-like for the role of Susan. Another thing that threw me off about this movie is the name of the department store. Personally, if I was a producer of this film and I couldn't get Macy's to sponsor it, I would have just called the whole thing off. That's not what these producers did.No, they call their department store Cole's in hopes that people would mistake it for Kohl's. Even if they actually did get Kohl's to sponsor it, it wouldn't make any sense. The name \"Cole's\" just seems so lame and desperate. They'd be better off just making up their own name as opposed to tricking the viewers. As a movie, it's fair at the most. As a remake, it's one of the worst ever. I give it two stars, simply because if you've never seen the original, it's... somewhat watchable.",

When the Cole's parade rolls around, the Santa she chose is drunk of his feet, so she chooses the only other option; a jolly old man who calls himself Kringle (Richard Attenborough). They find out that this man is so good, they have him sign a contract to be the store Santa. But is that all he is? He not only turns the store upside down, but he promises to do so much for everybody and claims he's the real deal. He even tries to make believers out of Dorey and her daughter, Susan (Mara Wilson) with the help of Dorey's crusher, Bryan (Dylan McDermot), but when the rivals of Cole's decide this has gone too farm they set Kriss up and have him arrested. Now the question persists: do you believe in Santa and will you help him? It is a very unique twist on the Santa tale even if it is remade.\n\nACTING:The acting is pretty top notch. Attenborough does a delightful job as Kriss. Perkins does a decent job, but she put a little too much bitterness in the character. At least, I think so. Wilson, though a child, does a charming job. McDermot wasn't spectacular, but he did a pretty great job anyway.\n\nSCORE:Most of it was Christmas music, but what wasn't was great.\n\nCAMERAWORK:Surprisingly, the camerawork was pretty nice.\n\nOTHER CONTENT:Now, what most of you are probably wondering is why I like this remake better than the original. I believe this version is not only modernized, but contians more charm and Christmas spirit. It could put any Christmas movie Scrooge in a yuletide mood. I didn't give this the full because I did notice what his one was missing, and that's its nostalgia and originality. I'm not that disagreeable. \n\nOVERALL,a great Christmas movie with a unique but remade plot, top notch acting, great score aside from the Christmas music, nice camerawork, and more charm and spirit than its original, though this doesn't contain the nostalgia and originality.",

The villains in this movie being in a rival store completely destroys one of the original story's main points. A generous soul can make even the bitterest of enemies rally around the common good, partially because it feels so good to do the right thing, and because, sometimes when you do the right thing, you can make more money too. The way this movie turns the rival store into the bad guy basically just reinforces the point that doing the right thing is only embraced by people who are always good, not that people can see the light while making a profit. No one in this world can ever replace Maureen O'Hara either. I love that woman, she was beautiful then, I think she's still beautiful now, just in a different way. She was a strong woman who had a tender side that she hid, and while that's now become a tad cliche, it was very inventive for the time, and she plays it very believably. But worst of all in this movie.... Mara Wilson. I'm sure she's not an evil person or anything, but she ruins this movie. The little girl in the original had a \"I'm better than you because I don't believe\" attitude, yet she still was able to effectively show that, in its own way, that was her pretending. She was playing a game, a game where she was not silly, and the other children were being silly. Upon seeing that they weren't insane, and she could enjoy such things as well, she plays and slowly begins to understand that believing is never easy, but always fun. The girl in this movie... she... is basically a sack of meat that looks cute. The whole movie, you could replace her dialogue with \"Aren't I adorable?!\" and then, take that dialogue and beat someone with it. Hated, hated being forced to sit through this movie in High School.",
