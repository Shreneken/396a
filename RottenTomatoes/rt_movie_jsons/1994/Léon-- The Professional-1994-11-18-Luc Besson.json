    "summary": "Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is only 12 years old, but is already familiar with the dark side of life: her abusive father stores drugs for corrupt police officers, and her mother neglects her. Léon (Jean Reno), who lives down the hall, tends to his houseplants and works as a hired hitman for mobster Tony (Danny Aiello). When her family is murdered by crooked DEA agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman), Mathilda joins forces with a reluctant Léon to learn his deadly trade and avenge her family's deaths.",

The photography was brilliant, using many different shots that highly evocative without showing everything. The score was great, the music was never intrusive but always present, always adding to the story. And then there was the acting. I personally thought the tension between the child and the lone killer was excrutiating. It was almost a relief when the shooting started again. You have to just fall in love with the two main characters. And then there is the overblown characture of a bad cop, which is played so well, that I was fascinated by him, even if the character remains a bit flat. But then again, there is no need to know any more about him than we do.\nA great movie, I highly recommend it!",

This is not animated action cinema, this is a nearly forgotton art of telling deep dramas in a fictional way that tells a story behind the scenes.

It seems as if each individual in the story has their own motivations, there are no true united factions. The dynamics between Mathilda and Léon are very well written - to me, not very creepy. Yes, Mathilda is always seeking to get a sexual rise out of Léon, but she is not acting like a thirty-year-old prostitute or something, it really seems like she is a twelve year old who doesn't know what she's asking for, and Léon seems like he recognizes this, and never entertains Mathilda's propositions or temptations. Elsewhere, Stansfield is a very well written character; the only thing that that screamed 'this is a movie' about him to me was his weird spasms whenever he took those pills. Tony was much too honorable, likable, and honest for a hit-brokering mafioso. The action scenes were very entertaining, and the choreography of Léon's moves was intuitive, if unrealistic. I liked the character's wardrobes (I don't understand people who say Mathilda is dressed inappropriately for a twelve-year-old). Overall, a must-watch. Fantastic film.",

The movie is a well made action film with an engaging story and  gripping atmosphere. The both main acotrs and especially Nathalie Portman did there best to make the characters shine as they where intended. What took some of the enjoyment  I had with this film away from me was the sexualisation which Nathalie  Portmans character Mathilda was exposed to. But this is probably a problem which is more prevelant in the extended cut than in the cinema cut. So i would say if you want to see it watch the latter.",

Thanks to Luc Besson's creative direction and interesting characters, Leon: The Professional is a cut way above the rest.  Leon (Jean Reno) is the soft-spoken but deadly \"cleaner\", a cold-blooded killer with a strict code of ethics.  Mathilda is the twelve-year old neighbor whose dysfunctional family has been killed as the result of a drug dispute by a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman).  The three main characters all have a depth that far exceeds that of characters in similar films in the genre.   But it's Besson's direction that truly impresses.  Filled with interesting shots, perfect blocking and probing camerawork, Leon: The Professional is clearly superior to the typical Hollywood cookie cutter thriller.",

His focused and expressive French direction alongside cinematographer Thierry Arbogast's stunning, long held close-ups and creative wide shots during the action shootouts ensure that Leon is awe inspiring for future audiences forevermore. I must mention that although Luc Besson is a wretched creep as a man, he managed to use up all his creative powers to write and direct one of cinema's finest pictures.\n\nBesson's writing is both creatively playful with funny dialogue and one liners, while also leaving you in despair at all the suffering and loneliness in Leon. His original story full of shocking brutality, clever wit, kind acts, and breathtaking twists result in Leon's memorable experience.\n\nEric Serra's score is riveting with gentle melodies and tight, anxiety inducing throbs of sound for the hail of bullets during the action sequences. Sylvie Landra's editing is sharp and tight, keeping Leon at a brisk 111 minutes that never feels long. Magali Guidasci's costumes are fun with Gary Oldman's white suit, Leon's all black hitman gear and vest, and of course, Natalie Portman's silly 90's kid outfits.\n\nJean Reno is so sensitive and subtle as the reserved assassin for hire Leon Montana. He's very playful and fatherly towards Mathilda Lando, saving Leon: The Professional's relationship with the young girl he saves from ever truly feeling gross. Natalie Portman is amazing for a child actress as the precocious child hitwoman protege Mathilda. She's funny, devastating, fearful, lonely, and a myriad of other emotions in a realistic flurry of acting prowess. \n\nThen, Gary Oldman is hilarious and terrifying as the crooked DEA agent Norman Stansfield. His campy drug addiction meets Oldman's gripping nightmare presence as the erratic and trigger happy Norman at his absolute scariest during the bathroom scene with Mathilda. Danny Aiello is excellent and enjoyable as the mob boss Tony with a nice rapport with Reno.\n\nIn short, Leon: The Professional is as fun and entertaining as action thriller films get, but Luc Besson's visionary direction and refreshing script keep Leon and Mathilda in your heart always.",

Natalie Portman has a fantastic debut as a vengeful orphan; Jean Reno plays a surprisingly vulnerable and lonely assassin; but Gary Oldman is utterly brilliant in his performance as one of my favorite villains as a chaotic evil disguised as an orderly evil. The action is top-notched and gritty, with an emphasis on more of how the main character, Leon, acts as a contrast as a cold assassin on the job than in his quiet life. But it all comes ahead in a third act that is emotionally gut-runching when those two lives cross perpendicular. Leon the Professional is an awesome movie that is worth a watch.",

And it's got a great cast, composed of Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and a young Nathalie Portman. The chemistry between Reno and Portman's character is unforgettable, it's packed with emotion and power. It's a good movie, and makes the runtime go pretty fast. While my rating may seem very low compared to popular ratings, Leon : the Professional is a classic action/thriller with great acting and style, I found it even moving in a way. Overall good film and recommended!!",

            "content": "Against his better judgement, a hitman takes in a little girl after her entire family is slaughtered.\n\nActing: 10\nLoved Jean Reno as Leon the hitman as it is inarguably his greatest performance. You can tell very early on this is a guy you don't want to mess with. Despite his excellence, Natalie Portman outshined everyone, even Reno, in her role as Mathilda, a revenge-seeking girl that has to grow up before she's ready. She leaves such an impact from the way she harbors rage and sadness, sometimes within the same scene. While young, this is also one of her strongest performances as an actress. When you're getting the best of your two stars, you know you have a great movie on your hands.\n\nBeginning: 10\n\nCharacters: 10\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 8\n\nConflict: 7\nI think my issue with the actual conflict throughout the duration of the movie stems more from how amazing the beginning is. The first ten minutes of the movie almost spoil you into expecting the rest of the film to be that way. Alas it is not. It moves at a bit of a slower clip and you start to feel it playing out as more of a drama than an action movie. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of tension to be had, just not quite enough to blow me away.\n\nEntertainment Value: 8\n\nMemorability: 7\nThere is one particularly tense moment that had my heart racing: I don't want to give too much away by setting the scene, but Mathilda is waiting outside of Leon's door, pleading for him to let her in. Every single time I watch that scene, my heart leaps into my throat even though I know what's going to happen. It's that intense vulnerability that really sticks out. While the movie isn't oozing with scenes to remember, say like my last review of Dirty Dancing, there was definitely enough to keep my attention.\n\nPace: 10\nOnce you understand that the movie is a drama and not an action film, you can respect the pace a lot more. The movie pushes character development and the relationship between Leon and Mathilda. By the time the film reaches its conclusion, there is legitimate concern for their well-being because you've grown to like both of them.\n\nPlot: 10\n\nResolution: 1\nDid not like the ending in the slightest. I was hoping for more. Endings like this are fine when there is more closure. As bad as it was, I still enjoyed the movie as a whole.\n\nOverall: 81\nLeon: The Professional is a great movie to watch with someone who prefers drama over action and you're trying to meet them in the middle. It is endearing to watch Leon and Mathilda's relationship blossom with the mad world that has been thrust upon them. The action is subtle, but the movie is awesome.",
