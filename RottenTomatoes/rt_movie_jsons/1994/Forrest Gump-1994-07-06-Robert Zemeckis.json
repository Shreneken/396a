    "summary": "Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field), he leads anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).",

            "content": "There's a scene in Forrest Gump that encapsulates the film. Jenny, who is dying from an STD, asks Forrest if he was scared in Vietnam. Forrest then tells Jenny about the stars in Vietnam, the sunset he saw from the shrimp boat, and the mountain lake from his cross-country run. Forrest even mentions a desert sunrise so stunning that he didn't know \"where heaven stopped and the earth began.\" \n\nForrest sees the beauty in everything. He took a question about fear and spun it into poetic gold. This is why we love him. His attitude and childlike wonder towards life represents humanity at its best. Something to aspire to. Based on the novel by Winston Groom, and adapted by the amazing Eric Roth, Forrest Gump is an opus about the power of optimism and how to endure life's pain. Forrest Gump masterfully depicts the hero's journey with amazing plotting and structure. It's a journey I want to take time and time again. \n\nRobert Zemeckis is a pro storyteller and crafts each scene with the right amount of humor, nostalgia, intensity, and human emotion. The framing device of Forrest telling his story is perfect. We get to live inside Gump's head and see a heightened version of reality from his mind's eye. It's a dream, fairy tale, magic trick, and memory all in one. \n\nForrest Gump grew up in Greenbow, Alabama during the 1950s. Zemeckis paints Greenbow with Norman Rockwell idealism. Childhood is a time of wonder but Zemeckis doesn't let us live there Scott free. Forrest has to deal with a single mother, a low IQ, leg braces, and bullies. Zemeckis is genuine about the story he's telling. Only a director that earnest can pull off a joke about Mrs. Gump banging the school principle and make it work. \n\nAll of these characters come from a place of Southern Boomer love and affection. The genius of Forrest Gump is the contrast between Forrest's naive innocence and Jenny's cynical life crisis. We get two opposite journeys in one. Forrest is the vanilla protagonist and audience stand in. He's an ordinary man who experiences the extraordinary. Forrest Gump is wish fulfillment. He's a country boy that sees the world. He's the feather that floats in the wind. \n\nForrest isn't focused on the destination, he's just in love with the journey. His heart may pine for Jenny and Greenbow but Forrest makes the best of where he is. He embraces the now. James Cameron once said that a movie doesn't have to be possible it just has to be probable. The byproduct of Forrest's low IQ and social awkwardness is that he has extreme focus. He can assemble a gun and play ping pong better than anyone. He can run from coast to coast and keep a pace. \n\nForrest pops up in so many historical moments that we half expect him to reveal the Watergate scandal that led to Nixon's resignation. This explanation is enough for the audience. In the army, Forrest finds a second family. Bubba becomes a brother to Forrest. \"I gotta find Bubba\" is the ultimate heartbreaking plea. Lieutenant Dan becomes the mentor and father figure that Forrest needs. Dan is a no nonsense bad ass who challenges Forrest and grows to respect him. \n\nThere's a scene where Forrest is recuperating at a VA hospital by enjoying ice cream. This moment is interrupted when Forrest receives a stack of \"Return to Sender\" letters that he sent to Jenny. This is classic Zemeckis. He gives you bliss one moment and breaks your heart into a thousand pieces the next. With Zemeckis we never know what we're gonna get.\n\nLieutenant Dan goes through the crazy character development that Forrest doesn't. After getting both his legs amputated, Dan becomes a shell of himself. He's a cigar-chomping drunk with a crisis of faith. He hates that Forrest saved his life. Dan has a lot of reinventing to do. When Forrest buys a shrimp boat, Dan agrees to be his first mate. \n\nThere's an amazing scene where Forrest and Dan survive a hurricane. When the storm clears, the duo have more shrimp then they know what to do with. Peacefully floating in the water, Dan thanks Forrest for saving his life and then makes his peace with God. Dan gets new legs and a new lease on life.\n\nJenny spends the whole movie running from her demons. She tries to fill the void left by her abusive childhood and only half succeeds. She returns home to Greenbow but she's not ready to stay. She's not done running. Forrest is crushed and the only way he can deal with his pain is to run. He runs for three years and eventually his heart begins to heal. \n\nWhen Forrest sits at the bus stop at the beginning and end he's wearing the old pair of Nikes that Jenny got him. To Forrest, the little things in life are the big things. At the end of Back to Future, Marty is rewarded with a better life. Some people don't like this ending but this is classic Zemeckis optimism. Forrest goes through hell and he gets rewarded for it. This is the hope of the film. We want to believe that every disadvantage contains an equal or more powerful advantage. We want to believe in the spiritual concept that all things work together for the good. \n\nWhen Forrest reunites with Jenny it's the healthiest we've seen her the whole movie. She has finally found peace. At the end, Forrest walks his son to the bus stop and the movie comes full circle. Zemeckis doesn't just wrap a present, he puts a bow on top. 1994 was a great year for film and against distinguished competition Forrest Gump won six Academy Awards including Best Director, Best Screenplay, and a second Oscar for Tom Hanks. \n\nIs Forrest Gump really that good? I believe it is. Alan Silvestri composed an amazing score and the film features a remarkable song list from the 1960s and 1970s. Forrest Gump may not be for everyone but it hit me right where I live. Robert Zemeckis and Eric Roth's ode through 20th century America is as sweet as a box of chocolates. And that's all I have to say about that.",

The cinematography and visual effects are great; there was nothing that made me question the director's choices. It's a touching story about Gump's journey through life as a disabled man who is also incredibly dutiful, hardworking, and, in some ways, wise. He never complains, and he just does, and I honestly like that way of life, which is simple and fulfilling. The story is mostly that of a slice of life because it's quite literally just Gump's life, but there is also a lot of drama, action, and history throughout the movie, which is why I think anyone can watch this movie and enjoy it. The characters were written beautifully. Many people seem to despise Gump and Jenny's relationship, but I believe it is one of the most profound love stories ever written. Juxtaposed, the two characters are very different people who go down very different routes in life. In the end, they finally get together, even though they have clearly loved each other for a long time. To analyze the relationship between the two would take a whole essay, but trust me, it's a tear-jerker. The performances by all the important characters were also great, but especially Tom Hanks, who plays Gump really well; he really came off as authentically disabled.",

The VFX are incredible, as well as production design and every other technical detail, such as editing. Man i miss a score like this one, so iconic and with so much emotion.

            "content": "Forrest Gump is my favorite movie of all time. Over the course of the film, you watch Forrest Gump's life. You watch young Forrest go from leg braces, to by the end of the film, running around the country for three years straight (literally), as well as pretty much everything in between. Seriously, the man plays for two different sports, serves in the military, becomes a shrimp boat captain, invests in a company that makes him a BILLIONAIRE, and a whole lot more. The thing that has always stood out to me about Forrest is his unshakable view of the world. As narrow and misunderstanding he may be, he sure does have a beautiful look on life, and it all pays out in the end. I have very seldom ever found myself tearing up during a film, but this film sure nails the emotions it wants to project to its audience. Forrest Gump will make you happy, sad, scared, disgusted, angered, laugh, and everything in between. This film is a very well-rounded story and the performances from the whole cast are extremely believable and makes you ever more invested in the events that the movie welcomes you into. I would be remissed if I did not give praise to the film's incredible editing. The film spends a lot of time showing famous events in the world's history and does a fantastic job of editing Forrest into the real clips in an awe-inspiring way, which just further invests me as a huge fan of world and American history. From exciting cameos such as Elvis Presley, John Lennon, and JFK, to amazing recreations of events like the guerilla warfare in Vietnam, this movie was not very short of perfection in integrating history into the movie's plot. Last but not least, this movie told a very intriguing love story. Jenny and Forrest are lifelong friends. During the whole movie, Forrest romantically pursues a relationship with Jenny, while Jenny is confused and is very on-and-off with her feelings towards Forrest. When he tells her that he loves her, she replies \"Forrest... You don't know what love is\". That moment perfectly describes they're entire relationship. Although he may be misunderstanding about things, and may be confused at points in his life, he's always known that he has loved Jenny. Jenny has been traumatized her whole life and is not ready to love until the very end. I am serious when I say that the last five to six minutes of the film are really a tearjerker with some of the most beautiful lines of dialogue I've ever heard in a film.

But the thing that makes it great is the charm. The acting and writing come together to make a movie that you can't help but like.
