    "summary": "An unemployed Maori living in the Auckland slums, Jake Heke (Temuera Morrison) has a terrible temper that he takes out on family and strangers alike. His wife, Beth (Rena Owen), takes regular beatings after he's been at the pub, and his kids do what they can to sidestep trouble. Nig (Julian Arahanga), the eldest, is joining a street gang; Boogie (Taungaroa Emile) has been placed in a foster home; and Grace increasingly retreats to the pages of her journal.",

I can't believe in 2023 I've never seen or even of this movie until now. It can be a little slow at times but keeps you engaged Simply incredible and well acted.",

            "content": "Just watched 'Once Were Warriors' for the first time and I understand why this film is important but honestly, I'd give it 3.5 stars overall. The messages and story on their own were superb but I feel like the acting was undercut by cheesy dialogue and horribly bad fight scenes which really broke the immersion for me; to the point where it felt like I was watching a sitcom rather than a gritty film even in the most disturbing scenes. In all of the fight scenes, it was as if everyone (besides Beth) was made of steel and everything they so much as touched was made of porcelain. I think in all honesty the fight scenes here were bad even for a film of the late 80s/early 90s. Character development for the kids and Beth was constantly interjected with shots of Jake at the pub talking with his friends which didn't build on the story. In all honesty, I think that after the domestic violence part in the beginning they could've left Jake out for the rest of the 1st act because that was all we needed to know that Jake was an absent, abusive, incapable father and a degenerate alcoholic. Almost the whole rest of the time Jake was on camera it was merely reiterating what we already knew and not developing the story further. The sheer lack of character development for the family was so bad I hardly felt much when Beth had killed herself as she had hardly been introduced before you know what happened. This only really improved in small bits at the end of the second act and in the final act but at that point it had me feeling like it was too little too late. Another thing I want to point out is that at no point was Jake ever humanized until the end but overall he's depicted as an unconscious antagonist villain like you would see in a cartoon or a comic book and less of a human with their own morals and rationale. That's not his actions needed to be justified but overall the characters were two-dimensional which again didn't do the skills of the actor justice. This film did everything it needed to to be great, it just didn't do hardly any of it enough. It was able to get the compelling and heart-wrenching story across but I don't think it did the story justice and I would love to see an NZ director have a shot at redoing or adapting this as it is a film with very important messages for all kiwis.",

It is filled with love, hate, violence, abuse and the hope of potential redemption. The raw power of the story and characters is very compelling. I never write reviews because the power of a movie and a great story rest in the eyes of each viewer.

            "content": "Considered by a 2014 New Zealand survey to be the greatest piece of New Zealand cinema ever produced, Once Were Warriors sounded like a great experience.\n\nIt really was. Once Were Warriors was a thoroughly impressive film because of just how gritty it was in its nature and its cultural relevance. It is the second film about New Zealand culture that I have seen and the first to examine society for the Maori people. I never studied it all that much prior to seeing the film so everything I understand about it I learned from Once Were Warriors. The film taught me that the Maori are strong people, at it also depicted them in a westernized urban society. Once Were Warriors is ripe with a raw and fearless depiction of the people and the underbelly of New Zealand society that many of them are forced to live in. It shows everything from domestic violence to alcohol abuse without hiding anything, and in that sense it is a brutal experience. It is the kind of brutal experience that any cinema aficionado needs to see because it works both as a raw depiction of alcohol addiction, domestic violence and a broken family all against the backdrop of Maori culture. This makes the film interesting both on a dramatic level and on a cultural one, amalgamating educational elements from both into turning Once Were Warriors into a complex learning experience and entertaining piece of cinema.\nOnce Were Warriors is great because of the complex characters. The story itself is a simple one which makes it easy to keep up with whilst it gets more complicated in the sense that the characters all have their own level of depth to them. The screenplay in the film is packed to the brim with strong dialogue full of natural New Zealand language with an organic level of humour lying beneath it to give the film some jolts of laughter along the way. But more importantly it characterizes the many characters of the film in complex ways. It is simple enough to keep up with yet complex enough to be interesting, and there are many lines in the film which are strongly memorable, such as Beth Heke's final speech where she says \"Our people once were warriors\". The dialogue in the film is brilliant, the characters are great and the exploration of Maori culture is incredibly insightful.\nThe film is an important examination of how culture is relevant to us as human beings, how it defines us and how our identities lie partially with it. For protagonist Beth, it is what gives her the strength to keep going the entire time, so the message of the film is beautiful if viewers can see it underneath all the visual brutality. Once Were Warriors is a film which makes viewers feel all kinds of things. Shock, sympathy, sadness. But above all, it gives them entertainment and provokes thought which is precisely why cinema exists. The film is brilliantly written and given top notch direction by Lee Tamahori. I was surprised to see that he was the director of the film because it was so good, and considering that he later went to Hollywood and became the sellout who directed the dreadful adaptation of the James Patterson novel Along Came a Spider as well as the overblown box office bomb xXx: State of the Union. It is almost prescient because the film depicts people moving away from their culture and losing identity in the process which is precisely what happened to Lee Tamahori after Once Were Warriors. But it is nevertheless clear that his direction on this film is magnificent. He gives the film a strong atmosphere which hits really hard and never looks back, and the visual style is striking thanks to all the great scenery and production design being captured with well-placed cinematography. The colour palette of the film is also very grim which casts a shadow of darkness over the story very well but still remains bright enough so that the visual quality of the film is nothing but clear. It is brilliant, and it plays out against the backdrop of a strong soundtrack and well-timed sound effects which are edited into the audio plane well. \nAnd as well as being a spectacle and thought provoker, Once Were Warriors is a brilliantly acted film ripe with an exceptional cast.\nRena Owen is a perfect lead as Beth Heke. She is brilliant because the entire time in the film she makes it clear that she is a strong woman, and she maintains the perfect level of dramatic ferocity as a manner of conveying that. Her physical involvement in the part makes her emotions clear, and the nature of her line delivery is just another element to reveal it. She is just immaculate in the lead because her performance is rich with tenacity over the character and understanding of who she really is which gives her the perfect edge. She says every single line with an organic understanding of why it is necessary to the part and her dedication to the cultural relevance of the film is thoroughly impressive. She develops well over the course of the story which you can tell through the growing strength of the dramatic chemistry she shares with the other cast members as well as something as simple as her facial expressions. Rena Owen is able to depict a lot about her character in the most subtle of ways and finds the right amount of subtlety to prevent herself from becoming overly melodramatic in the part. Rena Owen finds the perfect level of drama in her part, and her dedication to the role is just unforgettable.\nTemura Morrison is also incredible. The thing which he does really well is conveying the level of inner torment he faces as a slave to his alcoholism and his emotions, and he does it really well. He conveys the perfect level of aggression in the part by being physically intimidating both to the other characters and to the audience while remaining consistently unpredictable. There is no telling what comes next with Temura Morrison in the role of Jake \"the Muss\" Heke because he is such a strong character in terms of exterior power and confidence yet inside he is actually a slave to his pride and his aggression which makes him a weak man at heart. The character itself is thoroughly complicated, and Temura Morrison deals with the part thoroughly perfectly. His performance is strikingly intense and thoroughly brutal which makes him a fearful presence whenever he is on screen, and his chemistry withg Rena Owen is just incredible. The relationship they share is one of the most key elements of the film, and the way it develops over the course of the story is thoroughly entertaining. Temura Morrison is another perfect casting decision in Once Were Warriors, and he makes the brutal nature of the story into a terrifying reality.\nMamaengaroa Kerr-Bell also stands out in Once Were Warriors. She makes Grace Heke an easily sympathetic character by expressing the distressing nature of having to tolerate the destructive world around inflicting a damaging lifestyle on her. She remains consistent throughout all the material with natural dramatic talent and a lack of fear about what kind of material she can take on. She goes through it all very well with youthful charisma and strong emotional expression. She delivers all of her lines easily and remains engaged with the character and the material very well, so she is an exceptional addition to the cast.\n\nSo due to being emotionally challenging, thought provoking and rich in culture as well as stylish and acted with finesse. Once Were Warriors really does make a case of being the finest New Zealand film ever made.",

            "content": "A brutally compelling & riveting drama about a New Zealand family of Maori descent and their struggle to cope with the dysfunctional family unit. Rena Owen delivers an excellent performance as the tortured soul mother of the family, married to an excessively violent thug of a father, unemployed and borderline alcoholic. Two of the sons are criminals and the eldest daughter is coming of age, finding escapism from her home troubles however she can.\nThe acting is absolutely excellent. Temuera Morrison as the father steals the show as an absolute brute of a man, but is by no means a one-dimensional character.\nApparently, this was a massive hit in its native New Zealand, out-grossing even Jurassic Park at the box office. \nIt's a powerful movie to watch and is sometimes quite unpleasant with it's scenes of domestic violence and rape, but I'd recommend this movie to anyone.",
