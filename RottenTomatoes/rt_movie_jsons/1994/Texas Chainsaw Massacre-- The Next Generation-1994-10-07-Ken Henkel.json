Right from the start the characters established are the worst, whether that is extremely irritating, obnoxious or just plain boring, you hope that they get killed to put yourself out of your misery. Other than that, as a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie it feels distant, with certain details ignoring what had come previous and in some cases just straight up changing them, for example changing the Sawyer's family name to the Slaughter's. And of the Slaughter family, they all act far too ridiculous to find scary, even more so than what the family originally acted like. The main culprit of this is Matthew McConaughey's character Vilmer who is constantly shouting and acting weird where it is just stupid instead of actually showing how crazy he is.\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994) marks a low point for a franchise which never needed to be more than one film long.",

It's also the last movie in the original timeline of the films before remake and reboot and reimagining became the constant status quo for chainsaw movies.\n\nI can see why some people dislike this movie. After all, there's now a thousand-year-old secret society paying off the Sawyers \u2014 who now choose pizza over human flesh \u2014 to kill people to keep the population in a constant state of fear. Or maybe they do it so people can achieve transcendence through that terror. Leatherface, who used to be a killing machine, now struggles with not only his ability to capture and murder the teengers, but his sexuality, cross-dressing and screaming like a child.\n\nHe also does not use a chainsaw.\n\nThe real center of this story is Ren\u00e9e Zellweger's Jenny, who Henkel wrote the story around, claiming that was about \"her transformation, her refusal to shut up, to be silenced, to be victimized. And by extension her refusal to be oppressed.\" In the director's cut, it's shown that she's been abused her whole life, so the terror of the Sawyers leaves her unafraid.\n\nActually, they're now the Slaughters, not the Sawyers, and led by the other big star in this production \u2014 he wasn't at the time \u2014 Matthew McConaughey as Vilmer Slaughter, a maniac who combines the characteristics of the HItchhiker, Chop Top and Leatherface with a cybernetic leg and the need to self-scar himself. His wife Darla reveals much of the conspiracy theory in the film, except that she also claims that she has a bomb implanted in her skull and that Vilmer is from space.\n\nThis movie played 27 theaters, then Japan and then disappeared for two years, as CAA wanted nothing to ruin the success of McConaughey. It finally played in twenty cities in 1997. Yet it has its fans, as no less a Chainsaw fan as Joe Bob Briggs said, \"This is the best horror film of the 90s\" and called this \"a flick so terrifying and brilliant that it makes the other two Chainsaw sequels sceem like \"After-School Specials.\"\n\nThe end of the film features John Dugan, Grandfather from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Paul A. Partain, who was Franklin and Marilyn Burns, who was Sally. I love that she locks eyes with Kenny as the movie closes. I also adore that this movie has so many Texas bands, like \"Der Einziger Weg\" by Debbie Harry and Robert Jacks (who was Leather in this), plus songs by Roky Erickson and Daniel Johnston.",

IMO it was very low concept & it was probably time to challenge the character. reintroduce to a new audience w more zazz. like if LF had multiple personalities & the other was a normal man. like go for a Hulk x Banner relationship but they still have 10-15% control when the other is in the lead. go full Savini style gore. anyways this movies isn't that good but it's still worth watching.",

Such as a woman mask, and a old lady mask. Also it seems all leatherface does is just scream, and that's about it. So if you want to watch a very whacked up movie with cannibles eating pizza then this is your film. Still I was very entertained throughout, and that is why it has this high of a score.",

Made in 1994 starring \"unknown\" actors (at the time) Renee Zewelleger and Matthew McConaughey on a $600,000 budget. Shown at a few film festivals, titled as \"The Return of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" before being shoveled due to occasions between the producers and people at Colombia Pictures in the process, being in post-production too long, and re-edited so much, up until it was stupidity given a limited theatrical re-release in 1997 re-titled as The Next Generation. And what else they did to it was cut the timing to about 86 minutes in this movie, while about 95 minutes it originally was (before re-editing and re-releasing; which are mainly scenes when Jenny is abused by her father before prom, they cut out those scenes in TNG).\n\nNever watched the TROTTCM version of the fourth TCM film, only read about it. The film is loosely based on the 1974 classic, except the only thing is instead of teens investigating a grave robbing,  they're traveling on the road after prom. While everything else seems like its remade. \n\nIt seems you know why it took all the time,work to make? Because while shamefully being shown, the two lead actors and the viewers look at it and see total embarrassment from Zewelleger and McConaughey.  Even if it's principal props include: littering, Pizza slices, and wrecking shit (hope neither actor has OCD). I won't lie, it's fun seeing Jenny (Zewelleger) jump on a rooftop, dangle on power cables,  running away in her prom dress and can handle facing a shot gun at the killer; but dropping it and run. McConaughey looking dangerous without the gun, with his robotic remote control leg, cutting himself and acting like a dog. Leatherface is dressed up as a women,  he's nothing but a screaming puss. TNG is a sloppy, poorly written, dead dog from start to finish. \n\nLet me ask, did they release the movie again to ruin the two stars fame after becoming stars?",

Some kids get together after a dance and we are introduced to a cast that is cliche as all hell and that we've seen a thousand times before. The slut, the joker or normal guy, the jock or asshole in this case, and of course...the virgin whose innocent and somehow survives at the end. Well things just drag on for a bit in the beginning than we are introduced to Matthew McConaughey's character who is completely insane with a robot leg, that is never explained at all.It is very bizarre and surreal to see this all unfold. One by one the kids are picked off, and the character portraying the \"asshole\" is extremely stupid, and the acting in this movie is horrendous except for McConaughey's character. He is the best part of the movie and what is keeping me from rating this significantly lower. He is completely over the top and performing at his ten. He is off the wall, maniacal and insane. The worst part of this movie is seeing Leatherface dressed up in drag, its a complete mockery to the franchise. The absolute worst part of this movie is the involvement of the Illuminati in a strange attempt to make this movie have some time of sense. They also tried extremely hard to replicate scenes from the original in what comes off as stale and lame. The ending however is the biggest insult to the franchise is the tie in with Sally from the original. Stay clear of this movie if you are a fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but if you are a cult fim fan. check it out will definitely keep you laughing and entertained. For what its worth anyways.",

While it wouldn't be released in theaters for another three years due to the mindful hesitation from the film's distributor, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE NEXT GENERATION was born. Touted to be a remake of the original by TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE co-writer Kim Henkel, THE NEXT GENERATION follows all of the same action beats, but misses the point entirely. It isn't that people just don't 'get' TEXAS CHAINSAW 4, which is typically the case with the second film. It just really is as bad as everyone says. The so-called dark humor is completely lost on the audience. If there is anything worse than the unintelligible script, it is the atrocious acting. No one in the entire cast gives a shit about what they are doing. It often feels as if they were drugged and forced to act against their will, although the teens' ambivalence towards the horror that is unfolding around them earns the only guilty laugh. The hope would be that Henkel would make up for his artless production by splattering the screen with some gratuitous gore, but THE NEXT GENERATION is even more bloodless than the third film. TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 4 is universally considered to be the worst in the series, and rightfully so.\n\n-Carl Manes\nI Like Horror Movies",

It's not \"good\", but I don't get how there is so much hate for what is honestly the closest thing to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  That's not just in the plot (which is basically identical to the original), but it's a really gritty film that is full of characters that are very similar to the original.  This film actually depicts Leatherface more closely to how he was portrayed in the first movie, yet for some reason it's a huge part of people's hatred of this film.  McConaughey gives a pretty decent performance and there is plenty of action and interesting turns to keep the viewer interested through the entire running time.\n\nThat said, the movie isn't really \"good\".  A lot of the major reveals make no sense and almost feel tacked on to make the movie seem more important than it is.  Renee Zellweger is particularly bad.  The scene with her and McConaughey in the truck almost feels completely ad-libbed and Zellweger seems like she doesn't even know what to say.  Many of her scenes are hard to watch (and she's pretty much in the entire movie).  She must be thrilled that this movie didn't have a wide release until after Jerry Maguire because this is one performance no actress should ever put on her reel.  I'm not trying to hate on her because I actually do think she's grown into a fine actress, but just not in this movie.\n\nOverall, this movie is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  It's not even the worst Texas Chainsaw movie.  2006's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning is one of the worst movies I've seen, and while Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3 may have had better production value I found this movie to be more entertaining overall.",

The performances are all really camp and everyone in this film made me laugh at least three times.  This movie is really Hollywood and has a large stink from the dead teenager movies that were popular at the time (Scream, etc.).  The horror elements form the first movie are largely forgotten in the grand scheme and this film really was made (I think) to satirize the original.  It is the opposite end of the spectrum from the original.  While the original was made to be scary and almost documentary style, this film was made to be funny (or someone really underestimated what the horror audience would eat up as horror).  The performance of Lisa Newmeyer as Heather is either the stupidest performance ever or was made to be outrageously funny.  Anyway, this film is so amazingly bad that it is hilarious, especially considering that two very talented actors were in it.  It is, overall, very entertaining and anyone who watches it that can take it for what it is (a comedy) will definitely enjoy it.",

The acting is, especially from Zellweger and McConaughey, more painful to endure than being in a room with Peter Popoff for 80-minutes - overacting so dreadful I have to wonder if the actors deliberately tried to sabotage the movie. 'TCM: The Next Generation' is craziness for the sake of being crazy and fails to be entertaining or even interesting in a WTF-am-I-watching way. Ironically no one dies by Leatherface's chainsaw making the title only accurate about Texas. Adding to the inanity is the fact the movie is an ugly looking and moronic remake of the original effectively raping a horror classic. Leatherface is a cross dresser and I am still not sure why but it certainly turned him into a parody of an iconic villain. So, yeah, 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation' fails every second and only gets worse. Avoid it like a Pauly Shore movie.",

(Crying and terrified) \r\nDarla Oh there's nothing there (steps outside) hey, come out if you got any balls? Hello, fun's over (looks each direction) Hey, are you there? (Turns around and goes back inside) there was nothing out there! \r\nRenee Zellweger Wait, what (she questions)? There was a guy chasing me with a chainsaw (calm) \r\nMe (laugh) that is one of the funniest scenes from an incompetently written and directed film by Kim Henkel in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Next Generation. Hi, I'm Sleez Boy and today it's the sliced and dice 'em Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. \r\n\r\nIt's been 20 years since the first one came out in 1974 written by Kim Henkel and Tobey Hooper (director). Since then, none of the sequels came close to becoming an instant cult classic or a terrifying. Texas Chainsaw Massacre the Next Generation is the fourth film and it will shock and puzzle folks. Not that it's suspenseful, gory, or scary, but it's incompetent. I was watching the film thinking about what Henkel wanted with this film. It opens up with teenagers at the prom and it takes no time in identifying the soon to be victims. The script then takes them to the standard travel-slasher formula. \r\n\r\nTravel-slasher happens when a group of friends get lost in the middle of nowhere based on a number of factors like wrong direction or their tire is blown out. \r\n\r\nExample: Wrong Turn, House of a 1000 Corpses, Wolf Creek, the Hills Have Eyes and others \r\n\r\nThe film then moves on to a remake because the scenes are very similar to the original one until it becomes its own film somewhere around the plot. I was wondering about Henkel's intentions with the film. I believe he was making a standard slasher film until he decides to remake the film as the shooting went on, but found out that the film was doom, so he went on to make something kooky. Whatever it was, he wasn't trying in the film as the acting and dialogue was flimsy. There are bad human interactions that will lead to huge laughs and scenes that will annoy. \r\n\r\nThe journey begins when Heather (Lisa Marie Newmyer) and Barry (Tyler Shea Cone) get in a fight over inane reasons and argue with each other with ludicrous arguments. The two are spooked when they find out that Sean (John Harrison) and Jenny (Renee Zellweger) are behind the backseat and argue some more. They all talk to each other until they hit a car with man whose name is unknown. Heather, Jenny, and Barry go for a walk to find some help as their car is destroyed. They go to a place and ask for help where they are greeted by a peculiar possibly nymphomaniac Darla (Tonie Perensky).  She calls Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) to locate Sean and unknown man to pick them up. He does and the conversation goes like this \r\n\r\nVilmer Hey, this boy is dead. \r\nSean What, he's alive. He's breathing and talking in his sleep! \r\nVilmer Oh really? (Snaps stranger's neck) \r\nSean Ah, why are you scaring me? \r\nVilmer (runs over Sean) \r\n\r\nLittle do the three know, they walk down the road and try to get a ride from a passing truck driver and go after the driver leaving the nerdy Jenny behind? Jenny is left all alone and goes on to wander the road by herself. She goes on until she is picked up by a strange man in truck titled The Wrecking whose driver is no other than Vilmer. Who would have guessed it? He begins to spook and creeps her out until she discovers how evil he is. Meanwhile, Sean and Heather walk around a road that is the same as the original's plotline as they go look around a house that's two stories tall. From there, they begin to uncover the horrors inside the house and are attacked by Leatherface. (Motor sound) \r\n\r\nWe go back to Jenny. Hey Jenny, how are you doing? Well, she's running like the standard slasher formula and the madman Vilmer is chasing her down with his truck. Unlike her boyfriend Sean, she moves into the woods to avoid being road kill. Vilmer taunts her before leaving her in the dark for good, so what is a girl to do now? Kiss time bubble time, perhaps, room-room, she breathes and catches her air, twig snap. She stays there in the dark looking around room-rum until the motor noise starts off with a man popping out of nowhere. Yikes Scooby, we got to move! It is here that the usual pursuing scene begins with male attacker and the final girl, boring huh. She screams and runs even though she could have easily out run Leatherface since he is a big round guy carrying a large chainsaw. She finds a house to hide, but doesn't know that's where Leatherface lives. She becomes a fighter and becomes masculine as she toughens up and commits act of daring action glass shatters. Soon enough, she manages to escape for now. Watching this part of the film, I began laughing a lot more constantly because it was pretty silly and couldn't take the film serious. Now, I'm going back lights off. \r\n\r\nJenny manages to escape and runs into Darla which is where I began my review. Anyways, not to anyone's surprise, Darla is associated with loons and has Jenny captured and tied up. She meets is taken back to the house for a nice dinner party where we meet the entire psycho family. One of them is a hillbilly that quotes a lot of famous guys in the scenes. The other is the grandfather that doesn't move or say a lot. Finally, we get two unknown folks that are in the same status as grandfather. However, the fun doesn't begin until Vilmer arrive along with some with cross dressing chainsaw wielding Leatherface. This scene and part becomes a torture scene where there is a lot of shouting, screaming, and hitting that become bizarrely funny. I didn't know how to handle the droll. There is then scene of more torture and shouting matches that become pretty funny and disturbing that'll make you wince. It is here that I gave up on reasoning with the logic and went along as Henkel stopped trying. In the end, I felt like waiving a chainsaw and writing a sloppy review due to the film's incompetence. \r\n\r\nI thought there was no point to analyze the film because what is the point of taking this flick seriously. It's obviously been sliced into obscurity due to the ridiculous writing and directing. It's most puzzling revolves around the motive behind the silliness that makes this film into a cartoon. If there was a movie to compare it to, I would compare this film to the hilarious, but incompetent Pootie Tang. It's extremely lousy and awful, but yet it's entertaining as ever. As the motive to Texas Chainsaw Massacre Next Generation remains unanswered, the film's acting is moderately okay. The scenes with the teenagers were odd as emotions and interaction was bizarre like Jenifer's Body status. There's one scene where Leatherface stands behind and starts rubbing on her hair and she doesn't pay attention or say get your filthy hands off of me! I couldn't get into it nor identify with the character, and then there's Matthew McConaughey (feminist worst enemy). His performance as an unstable and demented psychopath that screams and shouts throughout the film works. It's so easy to manipulate the demented psychopath, but yet it worked.  Zellweger's performance was not too shabby as she does a fine job as the nerdy girl who becomes endanger and screams until she becomes masculine to survive. Her performances are convincing despite the lousy writing, but her screaming and McConaughey's laughter made the experience a little too uncomfortable. I write this because it's very exploitive when you have scenes of girls screaming while the masculine b*****d chases her with a weapon. It's so easy to shoot a scene like that, but it's hard to make it scary once you seen this happen a number of times. Robert Jacks was pretty good as Leatherface because he doesn't have to do anything other chase a person around although he over stepped his boundaries and portrayed the killer as a disturbed person with voices in his head. The music is pretty good as we get a lot of southern heavy metal bands. As for the direction, it's blind or that of a drunken foolish man. \r\n\r\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre: the Next Generation is a film not to be taken serious room-room. It's pretty funny and droll. There are convincing performances despite the inane writing, rum-room, and the unintentionally funny human reaction. There must have been a serious idea or vision Henkel wanted, but got lazy halfway or most likely at the beginning of the writing and resulting in this trash that teaches to solve our life's problems with a chainsaw. This Sleazy signing off and I'll be watching some flicks rum-room chainsaw sound!",

The most annoying people is the guy that played W.E. and this version of Leatherface; i swear to god this interpretation of Leatherface was fuckin horrible. Leatherface wasn't terrifying in the least he was just hilarious in a bad way. I mean what was supposed to be the most terrifying character in this film turned out being the most hilarious one. Then when Leatherface fully dressed like an old woman was fuckin horrible. This and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 are so far the worst in the \"Texas Chainsaw\" films.",

I lol'd heartily when Renee Zellweger told Leatherface to \"sit the f*ck down\"--and he complied. \n\nBut then it all could just as easily be that halfway through shooting the filmmakers realized they had a P.O.S. on their hands and thus decided to ramp up the humor so if anyone called them out on the cringe worthy footage they could play the \"it was intentional\" card.\n\nSo let us just assume that it was supposed to be a spoof from the get-go: the movie is still a HUGE mess. How did the self-proclaimed bitch get off the meat hook and crawl a mile down the road with nobody noticing? And why does nobody's dialogue have anything to do with the lines that immediately precede them? Is there an uncut version that I'm just missing or something?",

I guess they were trying to touch on something psychological with that but they failed horribly and turned a horror movie icon into a dumbass who wears women's clothing.

            "content": "Texas Chainsaw Massacre Next Generation is a sleazy and incompetent film that's fun for the whole family, roommmm-rummm (shout).\r\n\r\nRenee Zellweger No, don't go out there! He's going to kill! (Crying and terrified) \r\nDarla Oh there's nothing there (steps outside) hey, come out if you got any balls? Hello, fun's over (looks each direction) Hey, are you there? (Turns around and goes back inside) there was nothing out there! \r\nRenee Zellweger Wait, what (she questions)? There was a guy chasing me with a chainsaw (calm) \r\nMe (laugh) that is one of the funniest scenes from an incompetently written and directed film by Kim Henkel in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Next Generation. Hi, I'm Sleez Boy and today it's the sliced and dice 'em Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. \r\n\r\nIt's been 20 years since the first one came out in 1974 written by Kim Henkel and Tobey Hooper (director). Since then, none of the sequels came close to becoming an instant cult classic or a terrifying. Texas Chainsaw Massacre the Next Generation is the fourth film and it will shock and puzzle folks. Not that it's suspenseful, gory, or scary, but it's incompetent. I was watching the film thinking about what Henkel wanted with this film. It opens up with teenagers at the prom and it takes no time in identifying the soon to be victims. The script then takes them to the standard travel-slasher formula. \r\n\r\nTravel-slasher happens when a group of friends get lost in the middle of nowhere based on a number of factors like wrong direction or their tire is blown out. \r\n\r\nExample: Wrong Turn, House of a 1000 Corpses, Wolf Creek, the Hills Have Eyes and others \r\n\r\nThe film then moves on to a remake because the scenes are very similar to the original one until it becomes its own film somewhere around the plot. I was wondering about Henkel's intentions with the film. I believe he was making a standard slasher film until he decides to remake the film as the shooting went on, but found out that the film was doom, so he went on to make something kooky. Whatever it was, he wasn't trying in the film as the acting and dialogue was flimsy. There are bad human interactions that will lead to huge laughs and scenes that will annoy. \r\n\r\nThe journey begins when Heather (Lisa Marie Newmyer) and Barry (Tyler Shea Cone) get in a fight over inane reasons and argue with each other with ludicrous arguments. The two are spooked when they find out that Sean (John Harrison) and Jenny (Renee Zellweger) are behind the backseat and argue some more. They all talk to each other until they hit a car with man whose name is unknown. Heather, Jenny, and Barry go for a walk to find some help as their car is destroyed. They go to a place and ask for help where they are greeted by a peculiar possibly nymphomaniac Darla (Tonie Perensky).  She calls Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) to locate Sean and unknown man to pick them up. He does and the conversation goes like this \r\n\r\nVilmer Hey, this boy is dead. \r\nSean What, he's alive. He's breathing and talking in his sleep! \r\nVilmer Oh really? (Snaps stranger's neck) \r\nSean Ah, why are you scaring me? \r\nVilmer (runs over Sean) \r\n\r\nLittle do the three know, they walk down the road and try to get a ride from a passing truck driver and go after the driver leaving the nerdy Jenny behind? Jenny is left all alone and goes on to wander the road by herself. She goes on until she is picked up by a strange man in truck titled The Wrecking whose driver is no other than Vilmer. Who would have guessed it? He begins to spook and creeps her out until she discovers how evil he is. Meanwhile, Sean and Heather walk around a road that is the same as the original's plotline as they go look around a house that's two stories tall. From there, they begin to uncover the horrors inside the house and are attacked by Leatherface. (Motor sound) \r\n\r\nWe go back to Jenny. Hey Jenny, how are you doing? Well, she's running like the standard slasher formula and the madman Vilmer is chasing her down with his truck. Unlike her boyfriend Sean, she moves into the woods to avoid being road kill. Vilmer taunts her before leaving her in the dark for good, so what is a girl to do now? Kiss time bubble time, perhaps, room-room, she breathes and catches her air, twig snap. She stays there in the dark looking around room-rum until the motor noise starts off with a man popping out of nowhere. Yikes Scooby, we got to move! It is here that the usual pursuing scene begins with male attacker and the final girl, boring huh. She screams and runs even though she could have easily out run Leatherface since he is a big round guy carrying a large chainsaw. She finds a house to hide, but doesn't know that's where Leatherface lives. She becomes a fighter and becomes masculine as she toughens up and commits act of daring action glass shatters. Soon enough, she manages to escape for now. Watching this part of the film, I began laughing a lot more constantly because it was pretty silly and couldn't take the film serious. Now, I'm going back lights off. \r\n\r\nJenny manages to escape and runs into Darla which is where I began my review. Anyways, not to anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprise, Darla is associated with loons and has Jenny captured and tied up. She meets is taken back to the house for a nice dinner party where we meet the entire psycho family. One of them is a hillbilly that quotes a lot of famous guys in the scenes. The other is the grandfather that doesn't move or say a lot. Finally, we get two unknown folks that are in the same status as grandfather. However, the fun doesn't begin until Vilmer arrive along with some with cross dressing chainsaw wielding Leatherface. This scene and part becomes a torture scene where there is a lot of shouting, screaming, and hitting that become bizarrely funny. I didn't know how to handle the droll. There is then scene of more torture and shouting matches that become pretty funny and disturbing that'll make you wince. It is here that I gave up on reasoning with the logic and went along as Henkel stopped trying. In the end, I felt like waiving a chainsaw and writing a sloppy review due to the film's incompetence. \r\n\r\nI thought there was no point to analyze the film because what is the point of taking this flick seriously. It's obviously been sliced into obscurity due to the ridiculous writing and directing. It's most puzzling revolves around the motive behind the silliness that makes this film into a cartoon. If there was a movie to compare it to, I would compare this film to the hilarious, but incompetent Pootie Tang. It's extremely lousy and awful, but yet it's entertaining as ever. As the motive to Texas Chainsaw Massacre Next Generation remains unanswered, the film's acting is moderately okay. The scenes with the teenagers were odd as emotions and interaction was bizarre like Jenifer's Body status. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one scene where Leatherface stands behind and starts rubbing on her hair and she doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay attention or say get your filthy hands off of me! I couldn't get into it nor identify with the character, and then there's Matthew McConaughey (feminist worst enemy). His performance as an unstable and demented psychopath that screams and shouts throughout the film works. It's so easy to manipulate the demented psychopath, but yet it worked.  Zellweger's performance was not too shabby as she does a fine job as the nerdy girl who becomes endanger and screams until she becomes masculine to survive. Her performances are convincing despite the lousy writing, but her screaming and McConaughey's laughter made the experience a little too uncomfortable. I write this because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very exploitive when you have scenes of girls screaming while the masculine b*****d chases her with a weapon. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so easy to shoot a scene like that, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to make it scary once you seen this happen a number of times. Robert Jacks was pretty good as Leatherface because he doesn't have to do anything other chase a person around although he over stepped his boundaries and portrayed the killer as a disturbed person with voices in his head. The music is pretty good as we get a lot of southern heavy metal bands. As for the direction, it's blind or that of a drunken foolish man. \r\n\r\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre: the Next Generation is a film not to be taken serious room-room. It's pretty funny and droll. There are convincing performances despite the inane writing, rum-room, and the unintentionally funny human reaction. There must have been a serious idea or vision Henkel wanted, but got lazy halfway or most likely at the beginning of the writing and resulting in this trash that teaches to solve our life's problems with a chainsaw. This Sleazy signing off and I'll be watching some flicks rum-room chainsaw sound!",

It was quite clear to me while watching this that the filmmakers were trying to steal/borrow as many things as they possibly could from Hooper's film without making an official remake.  This resulted in nearly all of the original ideas from the first film being rehashed, including everything from the same kills being used again to the final shot of the film being replicated, where Leatherface is shown spinning his chainsaw around in rage (this time with far less purpose).  Let's just say, every single one of these things was better the first time around.  \n\nThere is also a surprising lack of blood from the kills (which are all extremely lame) demonstrating  an attempt at replicating the \"implied violence\" effect that was accomplished in the original.  However, while the kills in Hooper's film somehow still managed to shock us, the kills in this sequel simply feel like the shots of the victim dying were cut out in the editing process.  The effect feels disjointed and removes the viewer from the intensity of the moment.  One of the few things that I did genuinely enjoy is the fact that Leatherface dabbles in a bit of cross-dressing here, which I found to fit his character quite well and actually be equally hilarious and terrifying.  Also, Zellweger and McConaughey are both fun to watch, especially McConaughey who delivers a crazy over-the-top performance and sports an unexplained remote-controlled robotic attachment on his leg.  The fact that the two lead roles are both played by current A-listers who didn't know any better is probably reason enough to watch this mess of a film, provided you don't pay any money for it and you don't mind seeing some truly absurd and occasionally disturbing scenes.",

The film is basically a modernized version of the first TCM film, it really follows almost everything to the letter, nothing new or original here, no scares, to be found or smart, clever Horror bits. Not to mention Leatherface is a joke now, it's a total embarrassment to Gunner Hansen (the original Leatherface) This is a sad film to watch, there's not a single part that redeems this piece of trash, and not to mention that the family of crazed maniacs tormenting Renee Zellewegger and her friends, are aliens sent to earth to do an experiment, what a sh**ty ending, the only good thing about this film, is that it eventually ends. If you've seen the last three films of the series, and you haven't seen this film, do not watch this, save your time and money. This film is terrible beyond words. This entry in the series is very forgettable and is one of the most ridiculous entries only topped recently by Texas Chainsaw 3D. This one is a more modernized version of the original with added elements are simply stupid beyond words to the point where this one is almost a parody of the original. In terms of quality horror, this one doesn't offer that and is a total waste of time. Fans of the original will most likely be disappointed and hate this film with a passion.

We even have a subplot, which is briefly touched upon that explains that this is all supposed to be a spiritial experiment....WHAT THE FUCK are athey talking about. \r\nLeatherface is just sad and no longer scary or even intimidating, there's actually a scene where Renee tells him to shut the hell up and he sits down cowering...What is that all about? The deaths are taken right from the original film and the sets and set up are all from the original. The director of this film co-wrote the original and just decided to tweak the script and call it a new film. \r\nAfter the 3rd film, which had many problems as well, but was still good, you would have thought the films would end. Well it could only get worse and this film proved it. Now I've seen this film a few times, mostly from being EXTREMELY bored, but I decided to review it tonight, because it happened to be on and I felt the need to watch it and express the pain I felt watching it. \r\nMany people have complained over the remake and prequel, but I dare any of them to sit through this film and not admit that those two film don't start to look like Oscar winners after seeing this film. \r\nVarious cuts of this film have been floating around, but this has to do with the cut I've seen, the theatrical. If anyone knows where I can view the other cuts for free, please send me the link. I would be glad to view it and make a seperate review. \r\n1 out of 5 stars{only because of Matthew}",

This film is no where good as the original but I gave just a tad smaller rating then I gave the original. Why? Back then Renee was hot. Back then Matthew can act. The only two reasons to give the score that I gave.\r\n\r\nThe plot follows four teenagers after prom night. They leave early and crash in a nearby road and seek shelter in a home that has this crazy family who nurses a drag queen with a chainsaw.\r\n\r\nLike the other Chainsaw films, there is only one significant character in this film, at least for the protagonist. Jenny who is protrayed by Renee Zellwegger. The other character who I am most impressed with is Vilmer Sawyer who is protrayed by Matthew. Two actors who brought life to their characters. Everbody else seemed insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe film again is cliched ridden filled with ridiculous characters and a killer who always seems to be unstoppable. The plot to is quite simple but I have grown tired of it. No strangers home is considered your home especially if theres a crazy guy with a chainsaw.\r\n\r\nIf you like odd horror and hot girls, then this film might be for you. Otherwise, go find yourself a hobby.",
