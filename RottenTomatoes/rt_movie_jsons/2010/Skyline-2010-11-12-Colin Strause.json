The dialogue is cringe worthy, the stakes feel non-existent, the characters are bland and unlikable, the setting is uninteresting, everything is just lackluster. In terms of execution, this film was just bland.\n\nLook, there's no real point in going through and dissecting every detail in this film. However, one thing this film DID do well was world building. Yeah, kinda weird right? This film did manage to set up a world where this scenario exists and it's actually kind of interesting. God knows it wasn't executed well but it wasn't too shabby.

Well, THAT movie is crap even as parody on comedy and if You open Your mind to think (!) You would wellcome the Strause Brothers \"Skyline\" which has a surprising and suggestive way to look at large concepts we miss out today like LOVE, PROGRESS, HUMANITY, SPIRITUALITY & CORRUPTION !\n\nBesides that it's bloody entertaining and a well made action horror sci-fi, enjoy it with popcorns and a romantic red wine ...\nYou could argue that I over-interpret this movie, yes, I might be wrong, but the REAL REASON people hate this movie is that they think humanity loses to the aliens - HA !  ;-)",

Like a generic singer, they carried their tune without knocking any dramatic socks off.\n\nThe story is thin and the premise isn't original of course, and hell it isn't even fully thought out since the film doesn't give much background as to what the hell these aliens are and how they function...  They need brains to power up or to give themselves consciousness...  but why?  How were they born?  What are they like in their most natural state?  Everything begins from somewhere, but their existence lacks logic.  The ending although cool and actually more interesting than the rest of the movie still just created more questions.\n\nThe highlight and only real reason to see this movie is the alien invasion and at a very modest 10 million dollar budget, it delivers 100 million dollars worth of spectacle.  I was amazed at what the filmmakers accomplished with so little using their own backyard and visual fx house Hydraul'x Inc..\n\nOverall, it's low brow fun, not particularly great... but fun.

I am also a Gotham fan, and noticed David Zayas, his skills are now much improved. Donald Faison, being simply the worst in show.\n\nThe CGI was great, the direction of the action, medium.. but remember I am looking at this as a pilot for a series, if you want to run with the big boy sci-fi office box these days, you gotta come to the party with more than just a bottle of pepsi and a noise maker!\n\nI'd like to see the re-telling of inner rebellion, told from this world's POV.

Prepare to watch 90 minutes of people trying and failing to escape from a hotel. The film tries to reinvent the wheel by letting the aliens win, but this just makes it boring.  There is no plot to this film as at no point do you believe that the main character has a chance of saving the world.  He should focus his efforts into keeping his friends onside because he comes across as a massive tool.The CGI is good, but you only see the air battles from a hotel window.

The film deals with LA being invaded by very deadly aliens. The special effects are good and the creatures are intriguing, but the plot has many mistakes and no real backbone to it. Along the way I even got a bit annoyed by how the story was progressing. It had potential. Starring Eric Balfour (24, ), Scottie Thompson (NCIS, Star Trek 2009), Brittany Daniel (Club Dread, White Chicks), David Zayas (13, 16 Blocks) and Donald Faison (Remember the Titans, Kick-Ass 2). \n\nJarrod (Balfour) and his girlfriend Elaine (Thompson) are visiting Jarrod's best friend Terry (Faison)and his sexy wife Candice (Daniel) in LA to celebrate his birthday. The party is held in Terry's penthouse. During the night, when everyone has fallen asleep, blue lights come falling from the sky. Anyone who looks right into it, gets drawn to it. Waking up to the screams of thousands of people, Jarrod and his friends realize that aliens have come to earth to abduct the human race. Who will survive the alien apocalypse?",

            "content": "I'm not going spend a huge amount of time on this one, because it came out four years ago, and honestly, it's really not worth it. But it's not often that I'd rate a film so low. I've seen a lot of films that would be easy to criticise, but I always salvage some kind of entertainment value. At the very least, you're along for the ride. With Skyline, I can't even say that.\n\nThis film just happened to be on TV this month; I'd heard of it, and I saw that it had Donald Faison in it, who was always funny as Turk in Scrubs. Skyline isn't a comedy, and he's wasted, although he's clearly the most engaging member of the cast. As if to rub salt in the wound, he disappears fairly early on, but not before setting up a trite soap-opera love triangle, the tension of which is completely destroyed when all the parties are unceremoniously offed. The rest of the cast is even more forgettable.\n\nThe film opens with a mysterious blue light filtering through the window as our characters wake up in a penthouse apartment. Just as something interesting might be about to happen, we flash back to the previous day for some character exposition. We have to sit through everyone partying in the penthouse the night before, meeting each other and even more unnecessary extras that will vanish completely come morning.\n\nI understand why they wanted to have an intriguing credits sequence. Nobody would sit through twenty minutes of inconsequential partying if they film started that with without any other explanation. We'd have no idea where it was going or what the film was even about. The problem is that we still have to sit through the inconsequential partying in order to find out what it's all about.\n\nThe answer is that it's an alien invasion film. The blue light has a kind of enticing beauty that causes anyone who stares into it to walk willingly into the aliens' death machines. I do think this is an interesting idea. The concept that the aliens possess intelligence so superior to our own that they can manipulate us as easily as we draw moths to a deadly electric lamp (or how deep-sea fish lure their play with a glowing lure) is truly chilling.\n\nThe effects are good, as they should be considering that the directors are really visual effects artists by trade. The visuals cost $10 million of the film's budget, while the live-action stuff was done on the cheap, shot in the directors' apartment building for half a million, almost as an afterthought. There are big monsters, alien spaceships swooping around, tentacles grabbing people and all the rest.\n\nThe film just falls down completely on any kind of convincing plot or characters. You simply do not care about anyone. They behave unpleasantly towards each other and formulate ludicrous plans, such as making for a boat to escape the flying aliens, or driving across town in loud, high-powered sports cars. You spend more time questioning the stupidity of these half-baked choices than invested in the story. But this is just talk: the characters barely leave their apartment, and don't even die as the result of their bad decisions. They seem to be dispatched at random, as if nothing matters.\n\nConceptually, everything's incredibly derivative. Some aliens fly around trailing tentacles like the machines from The Matrix (1999), the large monsters stumble around and crush cars like in Jurassic Park (1993) and climb buildings like King Kong (1933), and the government unsuccessfully tries to nuke the mother ship like in Independence Day (1996).\n\nSimilarly, it can be no coincidence that the film came out around the same time as Battle: Los Angeles (2011), a higher profile LA-set invasion film. I haven't seen that one, but the effects for both were done by Hydraulx Entertainment - the visual effects company owned by Greg and Colin Strause: the directors of Skyline.\n\nIf the characters blandness wasn't egregious enough, you even question the logic or motivation of the aliens. They possess invincible ships with regenerative abilities and lights with the ability to utterly entice humanity. They can suck billions from the streets of a city in minutes, but need to devote resources to sending scouts door to door to pick off every last individual human, and they feel the need to supplement this with a pack of gigantic monsters whose motivation is to wreck up the place. Finally, they want to harvest our brains, which for some reason can perfectly interface with their technology.\n\nThe simplicity of the name 'Skyline' carries a certain amount of elegant gravitas which it utterly fails to capitalise on. It may have some merits as a special effects exercise, but nothing more. There's nothing here that isn't done much more successfully in other movies. If you want tune out your brain (before the aliens abduct it) and watch an overblown invasion, do yourself a favour: go back and watch Independence Day (1996).",

Terry is fabulously rich, and feels a debt to Jarrod for work they did earlier in life, so he's arranged a sweet new gig for Jarrod if he wants it.  Complicating this is Elaine's very recently discovered pregnancy.  There's quite a party where the new realities are awkwardly announced.\n\nAll this goes down the tubes during the next night.  Aliens arrive in giant starships that hover over the city.  The emissaries from the ships try mind control experiments on our heroes with mixed success.\n\nThe next morning, many have already died from the onslaught, and more die trying to leave the highrise.   Soon the story narrows down to Jarrod, Elaine, Oliver, and Candice and their attempts to survive.\n\nAmerican armed forces fight back with limited success. \n\n------Scores------\n\n\n    Cinematography: 9/10 Rather good.  Some of the CGI was a tad hokey.\n\n    Sound: 9/10 Occasionally hard to hear, but mostly fine.\n\n    Acting: 6/10 Eric Balfour, Scottie Thompson, Donald Faison, and David Zayas gave reasonable performances.  Many of the others were less competent.\n\n    Screenplay: 6/10 Exposition of motivation is more than a bit murky for most of the film, but the end redeems this.  The lack of clear intention by the humans is explained by the mind-control abilities of the aliens.  The presence of the aliens on earth is also explained.  I would think that most viewers would not care for the fact that one needs the last five minutes to make sense out of the rest of the film.",

            "content": "There are retarded movies and there are retarded movies, but it takes a special kind of stupid to make a movie as retarded as Skyline. When your movie's advertising campaign centers around the fact that some of your special effects technicians worked on Avatar, that should be a pretty big sign that it's going to suck. Unsurprisingly, Skyline is a loud, colorful, and technically absorbing film with a bland premise that sadly has absolutely not one lick of creativity, acting, directing, or scriptwriting talent on display.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to believe that a movie can be based and sold to audiences solely on special effects-- I mean, even Michael \"The Pyromaniac\" Bay puts some effort, although halfhearted, into crafting likable characters. But wow, Skyline doesn't even try. Its characters aren't even one-dimensional. THEY HAVE NO DIMENSIONS. A one-dimensional or one-note character will have only one stereotyped part to fill in, like the \"Generic Screaming Woman in Horror Movies\" or the \"Stuck-Up Federal Agent Who Gets His Comeuppance.\" But there wasn't even THAT kind of straightforward and depthless characterization in Skyline. None of the characters had emotion, none of them made logical decisions, and I couldn't even tell you who the hero was supposed to be. I've felt more attachment to video game characters.\r\n\r\nThe special effects (AKA the only reason people watched this movie) are shoddy at best, and certainly sub-par for a movie that actually went to theaters. Remind me how that happened again? Seriously, this thing smacks of a straight-to-DVD piece of shit in the same league as Sharknado. And when the CGI is serving a story as boring and straightforward as this one, you can't really give it any points for effects. \r\n\r\nFinal Score for Skyline: 1/10 stars. This is the Room of sci-fi movies, and can actually really be appreciated as a so-bad-it's-good, over-the-top piece of shit with literally no redeeming values. The only thing saving it from a 0/10 is the lack of self-importance it has. It doesn't pull an EL&IC or The Lovely Bones and pretend to be anything more than a moronic, frenetic, and poorly done (even by b-sci-fi movie standards) story with more bad dialogue and explosions than a Paul W.S. Anderson movie. It's the anus of cinema.",

Regardless of whether it might give me permanent brain damage or a concussion... Or potential death.\n\nThe special effects are good for a movie that cost $10 million, but is that where all the money went? No money to fix that script which was probably written by one of those \"aspiring\" 12 year-old writers who badly want to be the next Hollywood legends by writing something which makes no sense.\n\nThe acting is very, very bad. I can easily say that I have never heard of any of the actors involved in the movie and they all did a terrible bloody job. I could've played ALL of the characters and I would still do a better bloody job.\n\nIf you can fit a truck through all the plot holes in Iron Man 3 - You can fit two hundred Death Stars in the plot holes in this piece of ass. \n\nThe dialogue is movie-destroying to say the least. The dialogue is worse than what you hear in \"The Odd life of Timothy Green\". I literally cannot describe the awful dialogue, it has to be heard to be believed. \n\nFrom this point, I will be listing the plot issues and holes that demolish the movie. But to summarise - This is one of the worst movies ever made. Ever. It's shallow, incredibly stupid, badly written and filled with unnatural dialogue. If you have to have suicidal tendencies to watch Brother Bear 2; you have to be ready to shoot yourself in the face to watch this because that's the only way it will end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*SPOILER TALK TIME*\n\n\n\nAt one point; the mothership gets nuked. The main characters watch it get nuked. The blast radius was only several blocks, why wasn't anyone blinded by the blast? And why didn't they die of radiation poisoning? Also, the mothership survives with no shielding whatsoever.\n\nAt some point in the movie, they reveal that LA is the last surviving city on Earth. If this was the case; how could they nuke the mothership in the first place? The human population is very, very little and no one has resources. \n\nRemember how in 50's sci-fi they used to tell you that the aliens want your brains? Well, same case here. It took us quite some time to move past this cliche and in return we got more realistic scenarios like \"The aliens want resources\" or \"World domination\" or \"Universal conquest\". Why go back to it?\n\nSome time in the credits when the main characters are all eaten, they start to set up a sequel by implying that a character who was turned into an alien would remember his eaten girlfriend and starts flipping shit at other aliens. What's the point of the conquest? They have eaten all the brains in the world.\n\nThe aliens attract people with a glowing blue light which cracks people's faces. If someone saw another person stare at the light; wouldn't they know not to stare at it and as a result; not be abducted?!\n\nIf the abduction requires someone to stare at the blue light; why doesn't everyone pry their eyes away from the light? They can't be abducted if they don't stare at the light.",

It's realistic!! Okay, it's about an alien takeover, which may be unlikely, but it doesn't go through the movie ticking off all the usual clich\u00c3\u00c2 (C)s and actually has a surprising and refreshing ending. The alien machines were terrifying and I was left scratching my head halfway through how humanity was going to defeat them... \nThe visual effects aren't the best I've ever seen but they're by no means terrible & all the action scenes are handled very well.\nIf you like run-of-the-mill, over-patriotic and stereotyped commercial crap like Independence Day, you probably won't enjoy this, but if you're simply a fan of sci-fi and B-movies, give this a chance, you may be as pleasantly surprised as I was.",

Definitely one of the worst movies I've saw this DECADE, even when it tries to give a suspenseful atmosphere, it completely fails to deliver due to overall subpar acting and direction. Unengaging, unorignal, followed by a stupid, STUPID ending, that makes you question the sole purpose of this movies existence, it literally feels like a 7 year old took a hold of the material and did whatever the f*** he wanted with it. The movies DRAAAAGS itself at mid sections to try to establish a sense of dread and impending doom and it completely falls flat on it's face due to the fact that none of the characters are relatable, in other words, you couldn't give two sh*** about this movie, it's like waving keys in front of a child in hope to grab their attention, only here we get subpar acting and sloppy FX to try and keep you interested. It has nothing going for it, it tried NOTHING new, I don't even know why this movie exists when this alien invasion subgenre has been done to DEATH and still you can find mediocre movies out there that do it a million times better even when following the same guidelines. The action is boring, the effects are boring, the characters are bland... Just stay away from this garbage.",

Predator unpleasantness that was AVP: Requiem upon the world, you'd be forgive for approaching Skyline with the usual amount of carefulness you'd reserve for using the words \"please castrate me.\"\nThankfully Skyline is better than their previous effort. Not much mind, but at least it has a couple of redeeming features. In a bizarre mix of Cloverfield and Independence Day, the film follows a bunch of well to do 20-something's as aliens arrive over Los Angeles and start sucking everyone up into their big spaceships. Your skin sort of burns first for reasons that we're never really told.......the Strause siblings must have just thought it looked cool.\nThere's some nice jump scares from time to time and a real sense that no character is actually safe which gives the film a slightly refreshing tone. Some of the infighting between the cast of US TV stars isn't bad, Eric Balfour and that guy who was Turk in Scrubs and one of them off Sweet Valley High are amongst them. You sadly don't feel much sympathy for them as they're the kind of people you automatically hate but it is fun seeing them become alien dinner.\nSkyline unfortunately, for most of it's run time, doesn't have an original bone in it's body. This is not always a problem as long as you're doing things right but Skyline isn't. The film seems to go round in circles until the final five minutes when it actually dares to do something different, only to roll it's credits a few seconds later. This, rather than leaving us begging to see what happens next, just makes the whole thing seem a little pointless. If you've got an interesting idea, then use it....don't dangle it at your audience after making them suffer through Close Encounters of the Real World Kind!!\nSkyline is a step in the right direction for Greg and Colin Strause. They've managed to prove that they can concoct a decent scare sequence or two and not have to totally rely on shock tactics - there's no sign of aliens invading a maternity ward here, thank god!. They've still a long way to go as Skyline is far from a good film.",

The movie starts in peculiar fashion by threatening to thrust straight into action only to lead into a pointless flashback in time pre alien attack. The acting is ok but storyline pretty non existent and character building terrible. The special effects are what make the movie mildly viewable and the directors at some points show why they were involved with movies such as Avatar and Iron Man 2 but even this at times goes too far which leads to awfully constructed ending. Ultimately it's a glossed over stinker of a flick that steals ideas from Cloverfield, district 9, war of the worlds, and even artwork from Halo (convent ships) and Gears Of War (the reavers) the list could go on but it fails in all attempts. Looks good but it's hollow and disappoints! Watch district 9 instead or the upcoming Monsters which promises much more.",

Okay, so Brothers Strause directed this movie, and just to let you know, i'm not a fan of them at all. The only thing these guys are actually good at is making special effects. That's all! Also, Skyline has like the worst ending ever, cause the whole time i was thinking \"This crap can't get any worse, it can NOT get any worse. Cause it's so bad and awful\". Then, the ending happen, i realized i was dead wrong, again!. So overall, this movie has a shit script, filled with awful acting and bad direction.

Although the premise is interesting and the aliens are both frightening and fascinating, the ending of the film is too abrupt, extremely unsatisfying, and too depressing to truly be enjoyable.

The audience is forced to sit back and witness an hour and a half of non-existent characterization and flawed special effects, only to realize that everything that could be potentially interesting to see takes place outside the boundaries that have been created by the movie's writers. The result is an intense feeling of claustrophobic nausea that remains prevalent throughout the duration of the picture, and will only end once it comes to a close. The horrible performances and atrocious cinematography further bury the film into a hole of predictability. The Strause family has successfully created a total and complete mess.  \n\nAliens start to take over and they have this special power that locks people in their visual grip until all of their energy is taken away. A bunch of people that the audience has no interest in must stick together and try to survive the onslaught of the extra terrestrials. This idea would have been fine if literally everything was executed differently. Unfortunately it wasn't, and the result is complete chaos from start to finish. Joshua Cordes and Liam O'Donnell have created a terrible script that has no qualities in it whatsoever. Most of the film takes place inside buildings, where the audience is forced to watch horrible characters decide how they are going to go about surviving. All the audience can do is think about all of the things that are outside; hoping that at some moment the screenwriters will actually allow you to have a good time. It's truly baffling to think that a script as bad as this would get the go ahead from a major distribution company, but it did. The movie feels as if it is teasing the viewer, making them aware that their is cool stuff happening in the world around them, but the viewer is not allow to see it. Instead, the film presents the viewer with terrible dialogue from terrible actors, who contain no chemistry with one another. It's a truly  horrible concept. \n\nMaybe the writers had no interest in showing their audience anything interesting because they had foreseen the immensely horrible special effects that would follow their terrible writing. \"Skyline\" looks like a video game cut scene from 2001. The visuals are so insanely horrible that I had a hard time believing that this movie was taking itself seriously. Everything looked like a B movie, and that's not a good thing. The movie almost feels like an unpolished blueprint of a movie that could have possibly been created ten years down the road. The visuals feel as if they are a pre-production shoot for camera testing. To have special effects in this day and age that are this terrible is truly disconcerting. \n\nAs stated earlier, the acting is absolutely horrible. The motley of unknown actors give terrible performances, thanks in part to the utterly flawed script that was mentioned before. Eric Balfour and others seem to be almost completely disconnected to what ever substance this movie may have had at some point during its production. The terrible actors recite terrible dialogue in terribly structured sets, filmed with terrible cinematography, surrounded by terrible special effects. \n\n\"Skyline\" swings and misses in literally every department of film. The atrocious direction, terrible acting, insanely dimwitted script, and terribly offensive special effects don't help the movie clime out of the damnation that it creates for itself in its first five minutes. Rogue Pictures and Universal Studios, for some reason, decided to present its audience with a movie that progresses in literally no way at all. Its a movie that goes nowhere, and literally stays nowhere. The movie itself almost feels like its in the perspective of the extras, and the main characters are somewhere else off screen, where the real plot is taking place. When the film comes to a close, you'll find yourself wondering how something like this could have been released.",

And it's also filmed in Star Trek-vision letting every actor on screen repeatedly get overshadowed by miniscule lights in the background to the point where my brain feels like it has to swat a fly or move my head. \"Look, the lights are futury!\" I can forgive Abrams and friends as the Enterprise yes is a shiny, lit up environment but this sort of glare has no place in a cocktail party. \n\nAlso at one point he walks away from his actor friend to have a quiet conversation with his girl who turns out to be Prego! Mid conversation their actor friend mysteriously emerges from their private bathroom, which made me wonder how he got in that bathroom in the firstplace, seeing as how our Main left him to end up in this room in the first place.

OR, and maybe I haven't given this enough credit, but maybe the bathroom was connected to the hall. i dunno, It seemed distracting, but I should focus.\n\nThey're all in Los Angeles after a near pointless flashback of how our stars* ended up there in the first place. Bright pretty lights from the sky shine down and- Oh- They're lights that kill people! Luckily our Hero, after being lightly tugged on at the arm by a supporting role, gets knocked over just in the nick of time so that he doesn't die, no, but he's still doomed to sit around the rest of the movie watching stuff happen outside his window. \n\nIt's almost as if the production spent all it's money on cool cgi-er mostly cool, but didn't have enough for anything else.\n\nThese aliens, it is unclear whether they are biological, mechanical, or a bit of both. They're also telepathic, or something... well they can rebuild their ship withtheir minds, and they can make people go towards lights kinds with their minds.. They seem to be harvesting humans for their brains, which they eventually pop into their heads after discarding whatever other brain was in there. Was that my brain? I don't know.\n\nAfter some running back and forth around the building our Mains run back in with the Hotel worker who seems now to be acting as though he walked off the set of a [bad] John Carpenter movie. Helping our hero 'be a man' will do no good, but I wont tell him if you wont.\n\nLater, after some more action and lame characterization our main Hero and Heroine end up on the roof attempting to elude an Alien chasing them when it, as anticipated, comes down behind him! Maybe he shouldn't have been so focused on that empty space he was gazing at. Yet in a moment of pseudo-heroism, our Hero does what comes natural; he picks up a Cinder Block and beats the alien mech with it before [too soon] dropping it, and fake attacking it ith his bare hands. Add some cgi to make it look like he's interacting with it, aimlessly animate a brain flying slippperishly off to the side, and he's done! Man I had to pause and rewind, it was unspeakably hilarious that cinder block scene, and then seeing that animated brain just slip away quickly off frame against the seeing laws of film physics, i didn't know I was in for such a treat tonight. I should give this movie 9 Plan 9's JUST for that alone!\n\n\nAfter it resurrects itself, naturally,  some troops help them escape. They almost get hit by the plane from Die Hard 4 (well it might have been a helecopter, but it doesn't make a difference at this point) and we get our moneyshots in the form of extremely slow pans of - you guessed it - the Skyline! *gasp!*\n\nAfter that they get sucked into the Alien ship where I found myself hoping the two of them would get sucked into whatever Hive Mind was running things since I thought the movie would have ended 15 minutes ago. Jarrod does indeed get his head ripped off, his brain floats around and gets inserted into a mech, but -here's the catch- because he looked at the bright pretty killer alien lights(or whatever) and was pulled away before he either succumbed or got harvested for brains, he's now The One, so he can control the Alien tech with his mind alone! Now the excitement bubble will inflate forever, and we'll get to finally see him take down the aliens-wait, no? We don't get to actually see that? Oh hell, here's one lase look at that pretty blue light before we go to credits. Now you have one last chance to have YOUR brain sucked out TOO!! :D\n\nThroughout the movie I found myself thinking about the Rollerball remake, which is starting to look good about now, and Battleship, which admittedly I didn't see (I might watch it just for Liam Neeson he's badaz)but don't need to to realize that it's  more Transformers than District 9. But Skyline, to me, was worse than that. It was Battleship by way of Dragon Wars. Just awful awful bland bland awful. \n\nBecause Rotten Tomatoes only gives the illusion of a 1-100 film score(it's really more like 1-10) and I sometimes find myself somewhat indecisive about rating, I'm gonna go ahead and give Skyline a half a star out of 5. I could rate this higher but it would be like asking \"What's worse? Hellraiser: Hellworld or Highlander: Endgame?\"",

            "content": "Skyline is a monster thriller with some cool sci-fi subplot.\n\nThe alien invasion formula goes something like this:\n1) Aliens kick some butt\n2) Hero realizes a way to fight back that only he can accomplish\n3) Hero starts kicking butt\n4) Hero takes on harrowing adventure against insurmountable odds to save the human race.\n\nSkyline offers a unique sci-fi concept of the origin of a hero.  So, it basically covers only part 1 of 4 the story formula, barely getting into part 2.  As such, this movie could be described as a prologue to a great sci-fi epic.  Nonetheless, instead of being a 30 minute prologue into the rest of a possibly spectacular and novel movie concept, the story of extra-terrestrial invasion is drug out for 100 minutes.  \n\nThis means Skyline is your basic alien invasion or monster thriller.  This follows the traditional archetype.  The monsters cannot be defeated, can travel interstellar distances, yet have some pretty simple failings and limitations.  The monsters can hypnotize you by looking into your eyes, even over hundred of yards of distance.  They will chase you mercilessly.  However, they cannot hear you breathing around the corner of a wall, and they can't see through walls (even though our modern military has such technology), or for that matter, they can't see through window blinds.  There may actually be an explanation for why this is the case (wink wink), but you are likely to feel tempted to feel the movie undelivers.\n\nSo I say, see this movie for what it is ... a popcorn, \"get the monster as close to the hero without killing the hero\" thriller.\n\nI think the sci-fi concepts behind this alien invasion make this movie unique, and according to my 'prologue' description, could possibly lead to exploring a rich new universe of truly alien extraterrestrials.  Or it could lead to a great video game, or dare I say it, comic book.  Sadly, it probably will not lead to a sequel movie, because I think the movie doesn't deliver the trailer's promises and the critic's expectations, meaning this may fall the way of the unappreciated cult classic.\n\nThe trailer lures people in promising some science fiction goodness, and in comparison, the \"unrealistic\" monster movie rules seems to be a hateful impersonation of what we want from science fiction: believable, it-could-be-true fantasy.  Although I must point out again that as you peel the onion layers back, there are explanations for the aliens' failings.\n\nNevertheless, I think if you realize from this review what Skyline is, you will enjoy the pretty awesome special effects and the roller coaster ride it has to offer.  The extra-terrestrial design is very detailed, and reminds me of the art of the great graphic novels.  All you have to do to enjoy the movie is to suspend your disbelief.  That can be tough for us Sci-fi junkies, I know.\n\nThere are some cool surprises in the film relating to the origin of the aliens and how their technology works, if you are looking for it.  I'm intentionally being vague as not to spoil it for you.  (Once you see the film, you may have fun chatting it up on the internet about all the subtle clues in the film.)  The viewer may be frustrated, because the mysteries are only fully defined by the movie, and little is revealed by the end, paving the way for more adventure.  (I feel that I did piece a lot of clues together, and so I appreciate the artistry of the mystery.)  In this way, there is a lot more of the alien's world to learn about.  If you are the movie goer who wants an onscreen character to explain the science behind the science fiction, you may leave feeling cheated by the movie's subtlety in revealing the inner workings of the alien menace.\n\nSo in short, Skyline has tremendous potential, and I am sure the sequel will rock.  The movie will leave science fiction fans wanting more... and probably not in a good way.  Judging by the popular vote, we the people recognize this movie as a good time, even if it is not oscar material.  It's a monster thriller with some cool sci-fi subplot.  If you don't mind thinking carefully about the movie as you watch, there is a second, deeper level to the film.  I say this in the most positive way: you can appreciate this movie as a monster smash em or subtle sci-fi piece, making the film versatile for the audience.",

            "content": "November 18, 2010 - This past weekend, I had planned on seeing Unstoppable, the new flick directed by Tony Scott and starring Chris \u00e2Star Trek\u00e2? Pine and Denzel \u00e2Everything\u00e2? Washington. But my girlfriend and I went to visit her family in Kingman, AZ this weekend, and Unstoppable just wasn\u00e2(TM)t in the cards. See, Kingman is a bit of a one-horse, four-theater screen town, and the only new release within the city limits was Skyline.\n\nI know you\u00e2(TM)re probably thinking, \u00e2What\u00e2(TM)s that?\u00e2? Skyline is the very definition of \u00e2that one movie,\u00e2? but more specifically, it\u00e2(TM)s \u00e2that alien invasion movie.\u00e2? There were trailers on TV with bright blue lights and blurry spaceships; you know, that movie that looked like Independence Day meets District 9.\n\nNow you remember what Skyline is, and you\u00e2(TM)re thinking, \u00e2Why would you even see that?\u00e2? Answer: It\u00e2(TM)s my job, and ain\u00e2(TM)t always sunshine and roses. And even though you have no interest in seeing it, let me confirm your suspicions: Skyline is a sucky movie, and you shouldn\u00e2(TM)t watch it.\n\nThe premise is simple: Aliens invade, and the protagonists stand by Cloverfield-sans-handicam style as they are trapped in their apartment, waiting to get taken. Sure, they try to escape, but the drones that suck brains and the giants that suck people (and not in an awesome way) thwart our heroes at every given turn.\n\nBut let\u00e2(TM)s be fair: These people don\u00e2(TM)t challenge these aliens all that much. Yes, they are trapped in a hotel, but their attempts at escape are few and obvious, and they quickly give up and sit inside the apartment, waiting to die. In their attempts to escape, the concept of escaping in the sewers never occurred to them. From all I could tell, these aliens seem to be akin to a child picking off ants \u00e2\" they never dig underground.\n\nBut this hopelessness, which Skyline is chuck-full of, wouldn\u00e2(TM)t be so unforgivable were the heroes even remotely more than clich\u00c3 (C)s. These are not characters, but rather cardboard cutouts, played by actors we frequently recognize from television or as \u00e2that one guy/girl.\u00e2? This is a flick written and directed by former special effects artists, and one can\u00e2(TM)t help but think all that time dealing with manufactured moments made them forget the importance of the little things, like character development.\n\nThe same goes for originality. The situations in Skyline are all recycled from the aforementioned Independence Day, District 9, and Cloverfield, as well as Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing, Starship Troopers, and every other sci-fi movie you can think of. In short, you have literally seen everything in this movie before, and you\u00e2(TM)ve seen it done better. That the most original idea in Skyline comes in the form of an epilogue, and it comes off like an obvious, half-baked video game concept, should indicate the very most that a potential audience has in store.\n\nHowever, if there is one good thing about Skyline, it comes in the form of aspiration. The movie\u00e2(TM)s budget is reported to be roughly $10 million, but the CGI certainly doesn\u00e2(TM)t indicate as much. From the perspective of just looking at good special effects, I\u00e2(TM)d sooner watch Skyline than, say, similarly bad flicks like Clash of the Titans or Percy Jackson. Years from now, Skyline will be remembered in the same vein as The Last Starfighter (1984) \u00e2\" a bad movie that proved how much we could do with special effects on a limited budget.\n\nBut it will only be movie nerds, or the occasional grown-up who was subjected to repeated viewings as a child to the point of unflinching and necessary affection, who will remember it. Why? Because Skyline sucked.\n\nhttp://garysundt.wordpress.com",

The biggest insult to the movie is that the ending actually gets really interesting, but then it just cuts to credits and we see what appears to be stills of the aliens and characters represented by action figures.

A movie that came just out of nowhere much like the aliens in the film itself, Skyline is a cheesy, badly scripted, mediocre performance infected, confusingly plotted B movie. But the thing is me, Mark Kermode, Kim Newman and 2 other people in the world kinda liked it. Most of the B movies of the 21st century never follow the rule \"it's so bad it's good\" like the cult movies of earlier years. While it's nothing worth remembering, and anything but decent, imaginative and ambitious. Skyline falls into that category. It's not entirely satisfactory, but it's significant proof that low budget films can have amazing special effects and most of the time it's never entirely boring.",

A lot of people like to say that this movie rips off other, much better sci-fi films like Independence Day or District 9, and while that is technically true, it's not much my style to compare and contrast between films. I like to just think about the movie I see on it's own. But with that said, I'll just say that some decent special effects and a few nice action scenes are not enough to save Skyline from becoming a forgettable science-fiction shitfest.",

The story is poor, but alteast for the entire movie the story focuses on just the main characters, there is no underlying story. The acting debatable and the only saving grace was the SFX. \nThis is the movie the War Of The Worlds rehash would have been had the aliens not been prone to the common cold and it's as equally bad.

I started realizing this movie is so terrible when I found myself stretching limbs. Then I got a better confirmation when I was more preoccupied understanding the possible reasons for the I-am-in-so-into-this-movie screams of some women. God forbid that last night was their movie dates. Too much of a deal breaker. Their special someones just lack taste for films. Is it too hard for them to visit Rotten Tomatoes? There is no harm for believing in reviews. Skyline is so bad that I was thinking of these things instead of finding something positive out of it. I have the perfect excuse watching this horrible science-fiction endeavor \u00e2\" am just curious how it received a pathetic score from Rotten Tomatoes. Plus I do not have a movie date to torture for a couple hours. A few scenes into this special effects mess is all I need to understand the deplorable rating.\n\nOne element this Brothers Strause film venture lacks \u00e2\" aside from a compassionate friend to tell them stop making this movie vehicle \u00e2\" is a hero. If the lead stars are the last chance of human race from total alien annihilation then say goodbye to your loved ones because we do not stand a chance. There is no stand up and cheer moment that seems to be a de rigueur in all end of the world scenarios. In its place is a succession of clueless decision-making from a bunch of idiots. The brain-snatching aliens must be scratching their tentacles in total disbelief. So much for intelligent life in the outer space.\n\nDo not file this under Films so Bad It is Good. Hell no. This goes under the Just Bad Call the Guinness because It has to be a Record file. I guess the Brothers Strause still had a terrible hangover after a vodka binge while conceiving this movie. A sober person will not come up with this garbage. There is no point discussing the plot if there is even one to mention. There is no point mentioning the acting merits of the cast. Filmmakers should learn that a solid special effects effort does not cover up the fact a movie sucks.  This film has no point at all.\n\nThis is a harsh review. I think. Though the film is harsher. I find it quite difficult to call it a film. For the love of life do not even think of watching this movie. Save that cash for the future  or donate it to good cause. Trailers of Monsters and I am Number Four is so promising that I felt science fiction is going several notches up from the usual. This movie serves as a caveat to that promise.\n\nRATING: C-",

The film is also predictable and stupid, with some overactive performances.  Special effects similar to the ones done on the more superior \"District 9\" released in 2009 which is why this film gets 1 star.  One of the aliens weapons was a special blue light which if looked at long enough can end up being a victim as well and can be avoided if one were to stay at a stairwell or a locked room which the film fails to address!  And for some reason curtains, shutters and drapes don't either work or apply!\r\n\r\n1 star out of 4",

Sadly this seems to be where all their energy was focused as otherwise this is poor to average derivative scifi, with unimaginative and unengaging characters, an overambitious mishmash of both alien invasion and Cloverfield-type monster genres with a central concept straight out of the trashiest 50s sci-fi horror which is just unintentionally hilarious when played straight as it seems to be here.

I usually don't take to that limited perspective, but it somehow worked here. I even began to sympathize with their having to choose between staying and trying to escape--the condo building began to make me feel safe, too, despite knowing the inevitability of them dying there. To that end, it drew me in more than I expected it to.\n\nWhile it could be said the good guy won (sort of), the good guys (humans) certainly don't. I found that refreshing. No computer virus victories or weak immune systems or [insert clever idea] to win the day or leave us with hope of winning--we definitely lost. I'd have to dub it \"The More Realistic Independence Day\", and without the distraction named Will Smith.\n\nWhat finally made me go \"Huh\" and edged it to the positive is that cost only $20M or less to make--less than a third of what Battle: Los Angeles cost. And I consider it at least 70% as entertaining as B:LA, so it has a pretty good bang for the buck.\n\nSo I give it 3 stars. It's not great and I might not watch it over and over, but it did entertain me for an hour and a half and made me wonder what the outcome would be.",

The story was good enough to make a good alien movie but with the characters they had in this movie I just couldn't believe it. The characters in this movie were absolutely stupid and they thought they could out smart the aliens which made me laugh. The only thing that could have saved this movie was the action scenes and when it looked like something good was about to happen it just stopped within five seconds which made me pretty made. The only action scene that I thought was decent enough to entertain me was all the way in the credits. The acting in this movie was pretty terrible to since most of the actors are on TV shows and the others are actors who have no future what soever for acting.

All the action and emotion is happening outside but we are stuck inside with these douche bags. Then we only get bits of the story really. Don't know exactly what the aliens intent is except to steal our brains and shove them up their ass. Then the \"hero\" gets infected with power but really doesn't use it because he's to busy arguing with the building attendant. Then we are left with one of the biggest open endings for a sequel that I've ever seen. It was like they just had no idea where else to go with it and figure they'll come up with the rest in a few years. This tried to be like one of those reality shaky cam movies but without anybody running around with a camera. So we don't even feel we are involved.

For the budget it was made on, yes it looks great with the alien invasion, but its docked for its awful story. i found it a complete waste of my time when i was told it was a sci-fi epic, when there was hardly any action and too much boring dialogue. i think the writers thought they would try and make a sequel out of it with the ending which i found abrupt and stupid. none of it worked.

I went into this movie expecting exactly what I got, which was a fairly basic movie with some spectacular effects and some good actions scenes.

Whilst it's unlikely that the aforementioned sequel will ever occur due to the poor rating for this movie, it was nonetheless an impressive effort, although poorly executed..
