            "content": "The movie is super. Such a bright, kind film, but at the same time sad, exciting, dramatic.\n\nThe film shows everything: joy, happiness, love, and most importantly goals. But in life, too, we face this more than once. People love each other, and never let your loved one go so far. Great movie, just super! I've never seen such an Indian movie before!\n\nSuper acting game of the main character Shah Rukh Khan, as well as all the other actors. He surpassed himself in this film. This role could only be played by HIM, the acknowledged King of bollywood! In General, the actors in this film are incomparable. Kajol is just a Goddess. There are no words to describe her character. I simply adore you!!! The musical arrangement was generally great and I really liked the film itself.\n\nThe film is amazing, leaves behind an aftertaste. I love such films, if only for the fact that you learn about the problems of people with such characteristics, you begin to understand their inner world. Often in life, when we meet such people, we avoid them, because we do not know how to communicate with them, how to react to them. They're like aliens, so we're afraid of them.\n\nThis film can help people understand something important. Namely, it does not matter what nationality a person is or what faith, but it is important whether he is a Person. I really liked the phrase that my mother said to Khan:' There are only two types of people: the good and the bad.' It doesn't matter what your nationality is, what your skin color is, what your faith is, whether you are a person or not. If you look at it, every nation has apostates, atheists, and enemies. But still, there are so many beautiful people around.\n\nThis is a film about what makes us human, Love, Empathy and Faith. And even if we are all of different faiths, but before GOD we are all equal, no matter what it is called, it is the Same for all religions.\n\nWhen I watched the movie, I wondered if the movie won an Oscar...but...he wasn't even nominated! This surprised me very much, as well as many others. I'm sure the movie would have won him over. You need to talk about this film, know it, and advise everyone, because it teaches us not only to be more tolerant of each other, but also to be able to forgive.\n\nOnly the highest score for the film.",

I don't think this is the easiest movie to watch, but it is definitely very engaging in terms of its story. This movie has many messages but its primary focus is the rise of Islamaphobia. I think this movie makes its points very clear and is boosted by a good story and performances. I've always liked Shah Rukh Khan and I believe this movie showcases one of his strongest performances. He definitely put in the work to commit to this character and it pays off in the movie. The movie does have some moments that seem a bit far fetched which took me out of the realistic themes at times, but as a whole, this is a stirring and relevant movie I think everyone can benefit from.",

            "content": "This movie follows the heartwarming and tragic story of Rizvan Khan, a autistic muslim man fighting for love in the aftermath of 9/11. The story begins with us following Rizvan, who is trying to make it to Washington DC in order to meet the president. The very first opening seen allows us to see the difficulty with which Rizvan perceives the world around him and on top of that how he immediately gets racially profiled in the airport. The story beautifully weaves in Rizvan's childhood and adulthood in order for us to understand why he is on this great journey to meet the president. And of course, in classic Bollywood style, it is to rite the moral universe. It is to get the love of his life Mandira back. The movie brings forth difficult topics such as racism, prejudice, and nationalism into question. It plays with the idea of what makes a person bad and what makes a person good, and if religion or the way we look has anything to do with that. But more importantly it shows that love surpasses everything. The power of family and faith is very apparent in this film, and it plays with the idea that when families are divided, by any means, it is the same as when the nation is divided (Gopal), like after 9/11. Karan Johar does a terrific job conveying the struggle of Rizvan and those around him using strategic techniques such as close ups, camera pans, and montages to convey the immense emotional and mental anguish that he has to go through, when all he wants to say that he is no a terrorist. The movie is characteristic and falls in line with some of the themes that Yash Chopra displays in his movie Veer-Zaara. Both movies display the immense struggle of loving someone, when everyone around you is saying the complete and utter opposite. This movie is a touching tribute to the lives lost and affected by 9/11 and pays homage to the growth America had to go through. It is a must see to anyone who wants to feel empowered, sad, and happy all at the same time, and who loves a romance that can overcome anything thrown at it.",

            "content": "My Name is Khan is a well-directed film that encompasses the feel of love and sadness in a very realistic atmosphere. I enjoyed how the movie not only had moments of true love and happiness when Rizwan Khan and Mandira Khan start to fall in love overtime, but also times of true hate and sadness when their son, Sameer Khan is brutally murdered by his friends after the 9/11 attacks took place. The music plays a vital role in making the audience feel empathetic for Rizwan in his quest to prove himself as both a Muslim and a healthy individual. An amazing performance by Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol that will be greatly appreciated by big Bollywood fans. \n\n\tThe way the film transitions from happiness to sadness overtime reminds me very much of how the film Veer Zaara transitions from happiness to sadness very quickly due to a historical event and mistake. In that film, the movie transitions from a time when both Veer and Zaara are happy in their lives, to Veer being forced to be a branded as a spy and imprisoned for years. Similarly, in both films, the 2 lovers are rejoiced at the end of the film after the suffering a tragedy that almost tore them apart. Karan Johar does an amazing job brining many stereotypes to light rather than hiding them from the film. Oneâ(TM)s that revolve around mentally and physically disabled individuals as well as the idea of âislamophobiaâ?.  Karan Johar has a tendency to do so as Jerry Pinto states in his work, âThe Greatest Show on Earthâ?. For years Karan Johar has been known for stepping outside the typical themes of Bollywood and in this film he did just that.",

            "content": "An unfortunate incident involving his stepson causes Rizwan Khan to leave his home in pursuit of the President of the United States to tell him that \"[his] name is Khan and [he] is not a terrorist\" despite Islamophobic fear in a post-9/11 world. In addition to being Muslim, Khan also has Asperger's Syndrome and some of his mannerisms put him in difficult situations throughout the movie. \n\nRizwan Khan touches many lives in the film just as I feel like My Name is Khan has touched my own. I have learned so much more about what life was like for Muslims in America to deal with the aftermath of 9/11. In school I always heard the stories of people who were killed in the actual event but never any about how the event changed what it was like to be a Muslim in the United States. This movie also taught me new things about people with Autism/Asperger's Syndrome. I might never have known about how people with the disorder tend to dislike \"loud\" colors like yellow if not for the film. Overall I finished the movie feeling like I have a better understanding of post-9/11 life for Muslims as well as those who live with Austism/Asperger's. I personally didn't find actor Christopher B. Duncan to look or sound like President Barack Obama but that is such a small and trivial detail that really doesn't detract my enjoyment of the movie. \n\nBecause My Name Is Khan stars Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, it's impossible not to think of other movies that they have starred in together. I immediately think of Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, also directed by Karan Johar, where Kajol plays Anjali, a fun and expressive woman who I find similar to Mandira in this movie. Both movies have Kajol playing a loving mother but Mandira is a lot more angry than Anjali. Mandira grows angry at Rizwan for being so overtly Muslim and pushes her identity away while Anjali is committed to preserving her \"Indianness\" even though she lives far away from her country. Mandira is exactly the type of mother that Rosie Thomas describes in \"Melodrama and the Negotiation of Morality.\" Mandira, \"in her zeal for self-sacrifice...effectively abandons her family,\" who in this case is Rizwan (166). Her pushing Rizwan to the side is what sparks his journey. Though viewers may temporarily dislike Mandira for abandoning her husband who depends on her for help, \"filmmakers fervently believe that one cannot make a film in which a central mother character is truly villainous\" which is obvious as Rizwan and Mandira reunite at the end of the movie (166).",

It aims to appeal to Western viewers, with the usual show-stopping Bollywood song numbers tucked away into montages that keep the story going. However, the film still has plenty of heart-tugging Bollywood-style melodrama to fill up this admittedly overlong movie. Despite any weaknesses caused by relying on simplistic drama and stereotypes (especially in the Wilhelmina, Georgia parts), and the last-minute attack on Rizwan near the end of the film that barely serves the narrative and just seems to be there to push the drama to the Nth degree, the film still manages to hold itself together and take everything to a satisfying conclusion. Even the overuse of 'We Shall Overcome' is not very noisome. Shahrukh Khan gives an excellent and nuanced, if exaggerated, performance [it's a hard task to portray autism on screen without dialing it up to the max, so as to make it easier for the viewer to understand what sets him apart from others, and how he experiences the world around him]. Kajol also deserves credit for giving a very believable performance, even when her character does something unbelievable (i.e. pushing Rizwan away so harshly as she does - although this is just a sped-up, exaggerated way of showing how the sudden death of a child can easily tear a marriage to shreds). 4 stars all around, a very worthy effort and a favorite to return to.",

            "content": "Sharukh Khan Stars in yet Another Bollywood Film\n     My Name is Khan stands out against the typical Indian movie. It does not focus solely on a budding romance or a testosterone filled fight fest. My Name is Khan beautifully meshes many movie genres. It contains romance, drama, action, and a deeper message; which allows the movie to appeal to a wider audience. The movie tells a thrilling story of the plight of a Muslim and his family after 9/11 and opens the world's eye to the injustice and need for peace. Peace not just between Muslims and the world but peace between all races and all religions.\n     Sharukh Khan, usually premiering in feel-good romantic comedies or high intensity action films, takes on a heavier role to which he seems to have no trouble adjusting.  Sharukh Khan plays a man with devout faith and autism who is both laughed at and feared by society. He captures the emotions of every viewer and compels their undying support throughout his unjustifiably difficult life. Throughout the movie, he journeys to clear his name and transcend religious tensions after 9/11 drives a wedge in his family as well as the world. Khan says in the movie that \"there are two types of people in this world: good people and bad people.\" Sharukh Khan's character refuses to distinguish between Hindus and Muslims and whites and blacks. He looks past a person's appearance and religious background and sees their character. My Name is Khan works to knock down the walls that the world has built up and to encourage world unity throughout race and religion.\n     Karan Johar, famous Bollywood director, did a great job as always but his work in this film was quite different. The characters do not break out into songs every five minutes and show off the dance moves they probably spent weeks learning. This Karan Johar film does not possess the same pizzazz as some of his other movies such as Yeh Jawaani hai Deewani or Hasse to Phasse. While there was some sing song romance at the beginning, the movie was primarily done with a more serious tone than most Bollywood hits.\n        This movie will leave the audience glued to their seat waiting for more. It's heart-tugging and heart-warming but most of all, it allows the viewer to see the world through a different scope. Through the harsh reality of the plot and the constant adversities thrown at Khan, the film leaves no stone unturned and opens the viewer's eye to the hidden effects of 9/11 and the importance of worldwide unity. By attacking this serious issue, My Name is Khan strays from the Bollywood cliche and stands out as a unique movie of its industry.",

My name is Khan is a strong reflection about the anti-Muslim movement that propagated all along America after September 11 2001 massacre. You should know that I am not a Muslim and more than that I am an atheist. I hold no religious agenda. My name is Khan is set around an incident or a massacre very similar to the September 11 incident, in fact it is terrorism and it is about an attack on a building as large as the World Trade Center. \r\n\r\n   A man( Shah Rukh Khan) who is slightly mentally disabled because of some sort of syndrome looses every thing in life because of the anti-Muslim events that occurred in USA after the above mentioned incident and he sets out himself on a mission to meet the American president and tell him 'My Name is Khan and I am not a Terrorist'. One of the best things about this film is that it shows no religion or no sect of people as evil and stays un-biased through out the length of the film by showing good and bad sides of all religions involved and thereby maintaining a clear balance throughout. This is a striking story about revolution, will of human mind and a different look at mental illness. \r\n\r\nSome plot twists may seem too tragic and harsh and they tend to waver so much, but it can all be forgiven, forgotten because of a masterly performance from Shah Rukh Khan. This film also tackles a lot of the social issues and natural calamities, like the storms and continuous floods in Florida for an example. This is a must watch for all the people who love Indian films and Shah Rukh Khan.",

He was born in India and he had parents and a younger brother. He is an autism person and he happens to live in the period of Muslim - Indian disorders. The people living around him are divided into two groups. The Muslims hate the Indians and the Indians hate the Muslims. One day Khan repeats his mother a phrase that he has just heard in the street. Without understanding what he does he says the words full of hatred heard from his neighbors. In reply his mother draws a picture for him and says: \"Have a look, Rizwan, this is you and this is another man, he has a stick in his hand and going to hit you. And one more picture - this is you again and one more man, who is giving you a candy. Can you, Rizwan, tell which of the two men is a Muslim and which is an Indian?\" Since that day Khan believes there are no bad nations or religions, there are people who do the right things and people who do the wrong things. For all his life he believes what his mother has taught him.\nRead more http://www.viewforum.net/movie-stunned-me-150/my-name-khan-2010-a-3323/",
