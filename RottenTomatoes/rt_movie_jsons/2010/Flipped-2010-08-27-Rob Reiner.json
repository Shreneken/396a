    "summary": "When they meet in second grade, Juli Baker falls instantly in love with her neighbor, Bryce Loski. Bryce, however, does not feel the spark. From that day forward, he (Callan McAuliffe) tries hard to keep brash and unpredictable Juli (Madeline Carroll) at bay. After six years, she begins to feel that she was wrong about him being the love of her life. Unfortunately, that is just about the time that Bryce begins to think he was wrong about Juli, too.",

Right off the bat I would warn you if you can't stand stories about puppy love you may want to skip this since it involves a couple of 7th graders, but this is one of the sweetest and most wholesome love stories I have seen in a while. Of course the main storyline involves a person who can't stand the wonderful girl who is in love with him until he realizes he has feelings for her...its a common theme but the fantastic performances by the film's two leads help make this a very watchable love story. It's not perfect and it can be slightly sappy at times but if you don't feel a warmth in your heart by the end, you may be without a romantic bone in your body. A great couple of performances by the late John Mahoney and Aidan Quinn add to the film's strong cast.",

Without spoilers, the ending is a foregone conclusion and I found my temper rising throughout the movie.   One young person goes through a journey of life with thoughtful reflection and courage.  The other person learns lessons by screwing up repeatedly and ultimately learns a simple gesture of goodwill makes it all go away.  The movie teaches us nothing except that if you are cute you get more chances than the rest of society.    Is the movie cute?  Sure, but the lessons taught in it are dangerous for anyone to learn.   It's not about rescuing someone off of the trash heap to make them better, it's about making sure the heart wants someone on the same level.   I only wished I watched a movie that was on that level.  This is the biggest disappointment for me in Rob Reiner's universe and just may have \"flipped\" my opinion about watching anything he does.  Save yourself the heartache and skip this one.",

            "content": "Warning!! Spoiler ahead!!\nIn the movie Flipped, it talks about first love and growth. When the Loski family moves to a new neighbourhood, Juli Baker falls in love with Bryce Loski at first sight. Bryce Loski is a boy who grows up in a family with a lot of rules. What he needs to do and what he shouldn't are all under his parents' control. Juli Baker is a girl full of energy and grows up in a family with love, even though they are not rich- they don't have nice furniture and the yard is full of weeds. Her favourite thing is climbing up an old sycamore tree and sitting there to see the scenery. But because of the construction, the tree needs to be cut down. She defends it to the death, with hoping that her friend Bryce will fight side by side, but he hesitates. They are in the same class, and Juli always tries to get closer to Bryce, but he avoids it. At school, Juli wins the first place in the science and technology exhibition for her chicken-laying project and becomes the focus of the audience, which eclipses Bryce. She gives Bryce the eggs from the hens she raised, but he secretly throws them away when Mrs. Loski suspects that her eggs were unhygienic because the hens are being raised in the messy yard. She is very sad when she sees him do that, and the relationship between the two falls to a freezing point. Juli starts to think maybe he is not worth it, and tries to ignore him at school. She argues with her parents, why they couldn't have a big house with a nice garden so others won't think her eggs are unhygienic. It turns out Juli's father has a disabled brother. Mr. Baker and Mrs. Baker needs to take care of him and keep him happy. That's why they don't have many things left for themselves and are often hard up for money. Now Juli understands and is willing to make changes. She starts weeding herself and planting flowers in the yard. Finally, Bryce realizes he should be braver and brings a sycamore sapling for Juli. \nThe theme in this movie is family love and never judging someone or something you don't really know. How Juli and Bryce view things differently are mainly due to their families. Juli's dad teaches her to fight for the thing that she cares about. So Juli climbs up the tree to prevent the constructors from cutting it down. Even though Bryce wants to help Juli, he doesn't have the courage to stand with her and protect the tree because he doesn't want to get trouble. After the tree has been cut down, Bryce doesn't say anything to comfort Juli or apologize for it. As Juli cries in her bed, her dad shows her the painting of the tree and tells her when the treasured things are not there anymore physically we can still remember it in another way. \nPeople often look down on others' success and think it just happens by chance. However, the true reason is they can't do it, or have failed before. That applies to Bryce; he feels shocked and upset when Juli did hatch the chicks because she makes the impossible thing possible. When the Loskis family talks about the Bakers, they are mean and rude to judge Juli's uncle with cruel words. This particularly shows we shouldn't be prejudged if we do not walk in the same shoes that they do. \nI like how the sycamore tree is thought out in the movie. At the beginning, it is presented as Juli's favorite place which shows how Juli is unique from other girls. After the tree has been cut, the tree becomes a painting by her father that hangs in her room. This time, the tree is a symbol of the love in the family, that we are always here to support each other. Then at the ending sense, Bryce brings a sycamore sapling to Juli and they plant it together. The sycamore tree is the witness of the children's pure hearts. I highly recommend this movie as it reminds me when we are young we should chase after the things we are passionate about. We are allowed to make mistakes, when we are just getting to know this world, but the important thing is to learn from it and prevent it from happening again. As we learn more from the past, we will meet better versions of ourselves.",

Before he's even gone into the house his new neighbor, Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll) has come over to say hi, and for her it's love at first sight. Bryce, being all of eight years old, finds Juli annoying, but that doesn't stop her from stalking him all the way to high school. Will Bryce always find her annoying or will he eventually feel the same way about her? Well, I think the title of the film is a huge spoiler in and of itself, but that's besides the point. The entire film follows their interactions together, first told from his point of view, and then again from her point of view, making the whole thing very repetitive. The film offers nothing else besides the interactions of these two kids, no side stories, no friends, and even limited family interactions, it's literally just one meeting between Bryce and Juli after another. This is a film by Rob Reiner, the Director of Stand By Me, The Princess Bride, Spinal Tap, and countless other great films! I realize that not everything is going to be a home run, but couldn't he see how boring this movie was? Flipped is slow, repetitive, and even the damn title is a spoiler.

Her love for him becomes a part of herself that she can't separate from the rest of herself and his perfection a truth of the universe. Bryce spends years trying to avoid the crazy girl next door. He looks at her poor family, her pushy and stubborn nature and sees nothing inside her that would make her deserving of his attention. Here lies their most fundamental difference Bryce's love must be earned, whereas Juli loves just becomes. And at no point during the movie are we told that either of them is wrong. Sure, Bryce can be a bit of an unfeeling jerk, and perhaps somewhat of a coward, and Juli comes of as incredibly naive, but the writers mock neither. And they don't change. Bryce may widen his definition of the word worthy and Juli may realize that loving someone does not make them perfect, but the way they love does not change. It just becomes more nuanced. \nThe dual perspective only intensifies this. The actors are perfect for their parts and give spectacular performances, especially given that they are actual children in stead of twenty year olds. It is definitely a must see movie.",

In addition, it was cool how they combined an average middle- schooler's life with an exciting love story.\n\nJewel: I thought that Bryce and Julie should have just kept a distance from each other!  I do not really think Bryce's dad should have treated the Baker family wrongly.  He was a judgmental hypocrite.\n\nDanbo: The movie \"Flipped\" is a good  movie.  It is wonderful how they show both points of view of the main characters, Julie and Bryce.  Although some things are not explained, such as why Bryce's dad hated music, it was overall a satisfying movie.

            "content": "Flipped is a sweet, charming, moving, lovely, well-acted coming-of-age romantic drama comedy film.\n\nWhile the plot offers nothing new in particular (as with mostly all rom-com films)...the 'girl meets boy' mixed with 'the not-your-typical girl next door' story, but the storytelling is slightly different. \nAdapted from the book with the same name by Wendelin Van Draanen, the film is presented in a rather unique 'he-said she-said' style, through the eyes and thoughts of the male lead, Bryce and then again through the eyes and thoughts of female lead, Juli, alternately presenting their views and perspectives on a shared set of events. \n\nNearly every single event that happened in the film is told at least twice, although it seems repetitive, but surprisingly, it never feels boring or annoying. It's actually fascinating and insightful to be able to see into the thoughts and feelings of people in general. Things are not really what it seems and there's always more than meets the eye. As the film progresses, you are so emotionally invested in the characters that you actually begin to eagerly anticipate what the other side of the story might be, how the other person feels the way he/she does. \n\nThe film also gives a feeling of nostalgia, even for those who never lived in the era (the story is set in 50's or 60's suburban area) or experienced the same events as the two leads. It feels authentic and relatable nonetheless. Juli might appear as an ordinary girl, but she's a sweet, kind, beautiful, daring girl at heart once you get to know her.\n\nThe two lead stars are perfect in their respective roles. Most of the characters in the film have sufficient character development for the audience to understand them. Flipped is a period young love story, told in a simple and heartfelt manner. A rare cinematic gem.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n\n\"A painting is more than the sum of its parts. A cow by itself is just a cow. A meadow by itself is just grass, flowers. And the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light.But if you put them all together...it can be magic.You have to look at the whole landscape to see its beauty.\"\n\n\"Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss; but every once in a while, you find someone who's iridescent, and once you do, nothing will ever compare.\"",
