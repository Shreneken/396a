The cast completely nailed it and the transformation Natalie Portman underwent to play her role was breathtaking. We watched as Nina went from a bright girl with her future ahead of her to this monster obsessed with being perfect. We watch Nina lose her mind in her pursuit of an ideal. From the costume to the set design. The choreography was gorgeous and we could be right there with her in all of the crucial moments. It broke my heart honestly. It was also a good metaphor for what it is like in the dance, more specifically ballet, world. What these women and men have to go through to make their dances look effortless and graceful is truly disturbing. I do recommend this movie.",

Nina (Natalie Portman) is a talented ballerina competing for the lead role in Swan Lake.  However, when the enigmatic Lily (Mila Kunis) arrives on the ballet stage, Nina begins to feel threatened and begins her descent into a world of madness. Portman gives what is arguably her finest performance and Kunis and Barbara Hershey, as Nina's mother, are both excellent, but what makes Black Swan so effective are the directorial decisions made by Aronofsky \u2013 the use of handheld cameras gives the film a dizzying feel, some of the editing is ingenious, and the dance sequences are beautifully shot.  It is a film about passion and dedication to an art, but quickly evolves into a horrifying examination of mental illness and obsession, similar in many ways to Aronofsky's earlier films, as well as Roman Polanski's Repulsion.",

This movie had some fantastic imagery that kept the viewer guessing if it was an illusion or fact. Natalie Portman's portrayal was fantastic, really solid work here. The dynamic between her and her mother was so taboo and uncomfortable, but so raw that it felt completely believable. The movie gets in to so very intense scenes that left me feeling slightly uncomfortable, but that is what the movie was trying to achieve. I was suppose to be uncomfortable and it made those scenes all the better for it. There are some pacing issues with the movie, as it did hit a few lulls for me, but overall I found myself engaged. \n\nScore: 85%\nVerdict: Great",

            "content": "Darren Aronofsky could've gone several different directions after the acclaim and success he garnered for his Oscar-nominated 'The Wrestler' a few years back. Maybe he could've done something more commercial, a comic-book movie perhaps. But he has continued to prove he is a filmmaker of unique vision and bold direction, and solidifies this with his latest film. It's a brilliant, poetic exercise in genre-bending--a ballet melodrama with a psychosexual horror edge. It's an operatic, thrilling, arty, and highly entertaining thriller, absorbing in its visual elegance, deliciously wicked in its wit, and frightening in its chilling madness-as-art parable. The film is gloriously crafted on a technical level. Matthew Libatique's camera dances around its performers (often in revealing close-ups) with artful compositions, capturing raw emotions and catching those telling details. The film is also edited and scored to perfection. Natalie Portman breaks out as the front runner for Best Actress in her performance here. Her thorough commitment to the role is written on her frail body--rail thin, sharp and bony, and depleted of comfort and sensuality. She also does her own dancing, often to jaw-dropping effect. She perfectly embodies her character's brittle, paranoid naivete, yet also is believable as the sexy seductress her character becomes, an arc Portman delivers with unsettling verve. It's such a wholly devoted performance that she deserves any award they want to give her. Mila Kunis, given her meatiest role yet, sinks her teeth into playing Portman's opposite--dark, confident, exotic, and sexually aggressive. Winona Ryder does a fine job as a self-destructive dancer aging out of her glory. Barbara Hershey is equally touching and creepy in her Mommy Dearest role. Vincent Cassel oozes fierce sexuality and charismatic lechery as the theatre director. It's a superb cast, without one false note in it. But Aronofsky deserves most of the credit for giving us one deliriously hell of a ride, and one of the very best films of the year",

It succeeds in drawing the viewer into the paranoid state of mind the main character is experiencing. Natalie Portman delivers a fantastic multilayered performance that really make you feel for her character \u2013 it's hard to watch a person be so miserable for such a long time.

His style of storytelling fits flawlessly with his psychologically thrilling themes. So much can be said just by an actor's body language in this film. That's something that only great directors can capture and bring out of their great actors; when it comes to great actors, Natalie Portman is an exemplification. Her hard work and dedication shines onscreen; the award for best actress couldn't have gone to anyone else\u2026 \"Black Swan\" is the perfect balance of low fantasy, romantic drama, and psychological horror.

Person who was not 1% confident about her was confident about her just few seconds before the performance. If I talk about the performances, Portman's performance was too childish and irritating to me. I was literally not able to connect with her.\n\nAlso, there were so many hallucination scenes mixed with real scenes that you have to think if this scene is real or fake, while watching the movie. The direction was weak. The movie didn't had any peak except the last performance scene which tried it's best to keep the movie up.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with this movie.

Mila Kunis delivers a superb supporting performance, but Cassel and Ryder fly under the radar for stealing a few scenes for themselves. I also enjoyed Hershey as Nina's mother as a domineering figure bearing the same vulnerabilities as the main character. Black Swan is visually and technically near-perfect and worthy of all of its accolades, drawing from Tchaikovsky's work to create something more modern and a layered packing of sounds, sights, and sensations to trigger a grand reaction to one woman's quest for perfection.",

At the beginning of the film, we can vaguely start to see the origin of her perfectionism as an artist. This is obvious through her mother who clearly not only wants her to be a perfect dancer and daughter but to stay a child. This is so her mother can own and control her. Nina uses dance to control something in her own life. If she gets the dance moves perfectly that is her control doing it. It is how often people with mental illnesses use coping mechanisms to feel a sense of control in their life. But then throughout the film, we slowly start to see her turn into the cause of her own perfectionism, which in turn crushes herself. This is when the insanity starts to creep in. Her own obsession is the cause of her death. This need for control causes her to lose herself. What I found to be so compelling about this film is that it is an artist's obsession with being the greatest in their art that drives this insanity. This is something that everyone could relate to. Whether it is work, art, sports, people can find a way to relate to wanting to be perfect. There is a balance within the film or reality and insanity that portrays Nina's journey so well. It makes the audience question: how far is a person willing to crush themselves for the sake of art or acclaim or personal acceptance?",

Winona Ryder as Beth Macintyre or \"The Dying Swan\" was good but unfortunately, her role was not big at all, really wished if we could've seen her more. \n\nThe movie used the colors Black & White, as its theme in such a creative way and to present good & evil or darkness & innocence, what I mean by using black & white as the movie's theme is for example the set design, the set design was in plain black & white sometimes to represent the environment of the movie and what is going on, and the custom designs too sometimes. Loved also how the movie seems so dark as if we (the audience) are Nina.\nThe movie used \"reflection\" in many different deep ways like in mirrors and sometimes in others. \n\nThe movie's runtime was perfect, usually psychological horror movies are more than 2 hours but this one was less than 1h 50m witch was a perfect thing, it made the movie full of powerful scenes and not boring at all, for me the movie was great from beginning to end although it was building the story and the transformation of Nina in a very slow way, but with all of that it was still great and not boring.\n\nThe music and dance moves in the film were entertaining, the ballet dances were so entertaining to watch, and the way that the movie represented them were absolutely pure and beautiful, especially that last scene when Nina was performing in \"Swan Lake\" I was so entertained and the way the movie ended and everything was so cool. \n\nBlack Swan is a must watch and a movie that will entertain you from beginning to end, highly recommend this great physiological horror film.\n\nMy rating is: 9/10",

In our ongoing effort to help you save your money formore important things (food, for instance), we've made our annual guide the most user-friendly ever. Just match the headline to your cinematic taste and you're done! (Extra credit for reading the entire review, too.)\n\nDirector Darren Aronofsky's darkly enthralling entertainment makes the perfect antidote to too many sugary holiday Nutcrackers. Nina (Natalie Portman), an obsessive ballerina newly made prima for Swan Lake, is endless grace onstage. Offstage she is as tightly wound as the dancer on her childish music box: she retches in the ladies' room, tends her bloodied toes, indulges in fantasies both sexual and paranoid, and is altogether psycho in a delirious Hitchcockian way. With sublime balance, the film combines its high-art subject with the jolt of a sexually charged thriller.\n\nYes, there is lovely Tchaikovsky music, and tutus. Boyishly thin Portman reportedly trained hard (although you rarely see her feet as she dances). But Black Swan's up-to-the-minute brilliance comes from its blatant use of sex and its Sixth Sense-informed narrative. Vincent Cassel is a manipulative Balanchine-inspired artistic director who seduces then dumps his stars; Winona Ryder plays his latest has-been. He goads Nina into exploring her sexuality\u2014not with him, with herself\u2014so she can inhabit her dual role. She's ideal as the goody-goody White Swan, but unless she can channel her sensuous, sinister inner Black Swan, she may forfeit the part to her free-spirited rival, Lily (Mila Kunis). Assuming Nina's point of view, Aronofsky deftly leads us to wonder, is Lily really stalking her? And does anyone else see Nina's overbearing, failed-ballerina mom (Barbara Hershey)? Portman and Kunis's sex scene is already infamous (although it's tame enough for an R rating), but that doesn't answer the film's wily question: does it really happen, or is Nina's imagination playing seductress? Anything for art!\n\nFilm review by VEENIT",

Will she finally learn to cut loose and embrace her id, or fall apart en route?\n\nNatalie Portman is a nervous wreck in that leading role, finding comfort in the rigorous pursuit of perfection on-stage, but tumult and uncertainty everywhere else in her life. She's perfectly cast, petite and toned in a physical sense but versatile enough to dig deep and project the agonizing struggles that writhe within. Director Darren Aronofsky, no stranger to plumbing such depths, brings his usual grim, unflinching perspective to the scene. It's a good thematic marriage. Aronofsky's work is almost always oppressive and exhausting, which is why it took me ten years to get around to watching this one. In a very real way, I dread his films and what they'll put me through.\n\nPortman's performance (not to mention that of Mila Kunis, in an indispensable supporting role) and the gorgeous dance choreography saves it from being a total plod, but Black Swan is anything but a pleasant experience. Profound at times, pervasively uncomfortable at others, it digs until it hits the bone and then it digs some more.",

It's likely the most artistic horror film out there as well, incorporating the beauty of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake into something more sinister and nightmarish. Black Swan is an unforgettable film, and no doubt one of the best of the decade.",

The audio is fantastic. It's kind of like The Shinning in the sense where it fucks with your head. I can tell already this is going to be a really good psychologically fucked up movie.\n\nColor plays an essential role in this movie almost like another character. Portman's character wears pink which is a light color signifying that she still is a nice person, she still has her good side intact within her.\n\nThe imagery and symbolism is great. There's great use of mirrors and seeing double. I think Nina might be a bit mentally unstable, maybe schizophrenic. She keeps hearing voices. Nina's mom looks like she could suck your soul from right out of your body. I think it's her features but also there's this dark uneasy undertone with her.\n\nThe play director is almost playing the part of the devil or a demon that's trying to get the bad and evil side of Nina to come out. Nina's mother seems over protective and seems like she's protecting her daughter's virginity almost like she doesn't want her to grow up and become an adult. Holy shit the last 30 minutes we're so good and I knew it was going to be like that.\n\nThis movie, more than anything, is about  becoming an adult, losing one's innocence, discovering yourself, and the desire for perfection. Aronofsky's twist on it all makes for a disturbing yet very interesting and entertaining watch. Amazing movie!",

Speaking frankly and honestly, I was only decently taken by the film for the first two-thirds or so. It's dark and compelling, but -- much like the qualms levied towards Natalie Portman's Nina Sayers throughout those portions of the film -- I felt as though something was missing. Some sort of shot of adrenaline to get things really moving forward. And by the time the third act rolls around, boy, do things get intense. Maybe that's the meta-structural brilliance of this film. Perhaps we, the audience, are all operating on a plane similar to that of Vincent Cassell's Thomas Leroy, constantly doubting the darkness and vigor within, only to be blown away by the utter potential we see fulfilled in the end. Or maybe it was just me who found the first two-thirds to be nowhere near as enthralling as the last few minutes. Either way, the overall product is great, featuring that committed, Oscar-winning performance from Natalie Portman and -- once again -- a truly fantastic finale.",

That aside, however, this psychological horror kept me glued to the screen, gasping at shocking moments, and most importantly, asked me to think about it again and again long after I finished. The highlight of all this was of course Natalie Portman, who gives the performance of the year, or if not, the decade, in a troublingly flawless performance. Aronofsky also elevates his film by using rich texture and symbolism throughout, perfectly complemented by Matthew Libatique's shaky cinematography which feels unstable yet calculated. Credits as well to Kunis, Cassel and Hershey for their great supporting performances. My big problem with this film though was the interpretation that the film is an allegory of transitioning from innocence into someone wild and sexualized. There are some things you cannot explain, and I just didn't buy it, though that's the only explanation that can link everything in the film. As a psychological horror though, this film breathtakingly reconsiders Swan Lake and capture the dynamics of perfection not only in art but beyond that: perfection as viewed by society, the view of perfection by our peers, and most importantly, the perfection we see in ourselves.",

            "content": "Horror has never really been my genre but Black Swan kept me engaged because more than being a horror it's a film about the struggle of being an artist. I've been interested in Darren Aronofsky as a director since seeing Pi (1998) with my parents and this being one of his most popular films I expected something great. I really enjoyed elements of it and the performances of Barbara Hershey and Vincent Cassel were perfect but I felt it got too caught up in the Mila Kunis subplot and it ran a little too long for my liking. This is probably one of the better horror films I've seen but I wouldn't place it on the level of Carrie (1976) or The Shining (1980) because Natalie Portman's performance isn't as good as Sissy Spacek's and comparing it to something as intricately constructed as The Shining is just unfair.\n\nNina Sayers, Natalie Portman, is a technically gifted young ballerina who is extremely conscientious about her craft, a fact that lets her down when she asked to portrayed the sensual and free-moving black swan in a production of Swan Lake. She is given the lead role despite her difficulty with one half of it and she faces off against a lascivious ballet instructor, Vincent Cassel, the concerns of her mother, Barbara Hershey, a rival ballerina with a greater handle on the black swan role in Lily, Mila Kunis, and herself as her hysteria leads her to have visions of transforming into a black swan. She pushes herself to the limit as she strives to perfect her performance in the role and become what those around her want her to be causing a disturbing chain of events and a surreal climax.\n\nScenes of a woman tearing a strip of perfectly healthy flesh off of her body and then watching in awe as shockingly red blood cascades out from the wound is always going to be uncomfortable but it is the mental not physical horror that Sayers and the audience face that is more terrifying. Jealousy is an emotion that is universally relatable and seeing Lily through the eyes of Sayers we understand her envy, how could someone who seemingly tries so little be so effortlessly talented? When she listens to her mother berate her for scratching herself in stressful moments that anxiety is felt by all audience members, the disappointment and rage of your mother is a scary thing to contend with. All of these human obstacles are well conveyed and all of them put together ratchet up the stress level so that we understand why Sayers act out. Combining that with grotesquely beautiful body horror makes for a stressful experience. \n\nBarbara Hershey, one of the greatest living actresses, is almost too good as the mother living vicariously through her daughter who is caring and attentive but also infantilizes her daughter in a dangerous way. The scenes between herself and Portman are some of the best in the film as Hershey draws the best out of her fellow actress as she always does. Her laser focus on every word her daughter utters and the way that all of her words are spoken with a touch of annoyance as though she is directing her criticisms both at her daughter and herself add to the sinister aura that surrounds the character. Cassel is fantastic as a very creepy ballet instructor who has a habit of starting inappropriate relationships with his charges as his shifts from cold and professional to manipulative seduction are smooth. Barbara Hershey would have been a deserving Best Supporting Actress winner and her lack of nomination is shocking and disappointing but the Academy has a habit of not properly recognizing her.\n\nThe moments where the film loses me are when Sayers and Lily go out for a night of debauchery with a young Sebastian Stan and eventually one another. Aronofsky lingers on the lesbian \u00e2~lovemaking' a little too long for my liking and it feels like an expensive pornographic film for a while instead of a thinking man's horror movie. We also see Portman, clad only in pink underwear, writhing around with her hand down her knickers attempting to let loose, an idea that we only needed a few seconds of screen time to convey but instead we get a full minute of this. For a film that is largely critical of the male gaze with Vincent Cassel's character being seen as a negative force these scenes feel as though they're being shot by Paul Verhoeven.\n\nThis is a very good film that could do with a few unnecessarily long scenes being cut down but Hershey's wonderfulness and the close-to-home depiction of everyday stresses put the film well above the rest.",

And by that I mean that besides that she possess a flaw that leads to her downfall, which she must accept with honour, we, the audience, shouldn't expect to be surprised by the ending; it's often kinda predictable. With that being said, we must know that Aronofsky's task is that of filling the movie with a sense of dread and macabre atmosphere in order to forebode the tragic ending, while pushing the envelope as much as he can in order to make everything seem original, and hence unexpected.\n\nThe first thing is actually what Darren Aronofsky excels at. And in Black Swan, Aronofsky created a nightmarish surrealistic ambiance; using some of the most effective, if not the most violent, graphic gory images he ever used in his movies, and utilizing the sound almost as perfect as he did in Requiem for a Dream, only this time not just to disturb, but also to scare and daunt. In doing so, Aronofsky went far beyond foreshadowing Nina's dreadful inevitable downfall, making us feel Nina's pain as if we became her; Aronofsky made my feathery skin crawls!\n\nAlas, Black Swan's visual imagery sadly lacks creativity. Most of the symbolic imagery I felt that they are quite familiar, and that I had seen many times before. That said, the visceral and bold direction of Aronofsky made up for that with genuine intensity.\n\nThe vague and mysterious nature of the characters and their actions adds up to the uniqueness of the movie, especially as they don't tarnish the drama, nor reject the logic for the sake of surrealism. I enjoyed interpreting the characters' motives, actions, and even purposes and roles in the story. The way they are represented can feel a bit messy sometimes, though. I think that what made me believe that the movie is a bit convoluted for its own good, and that Aronofsky tried too hard to give us as many reasons as he could to persuade us that Nina deserves her tragic fate while Nina's \"hamartia\" is crystal clear from hundred miles away in a most play-like way.\n\nThe performances are all truly outstanding. As for Natalie Portman, she delivered what is indisputably her fantastic career's best performance; she was simply Perfect!\n\n(8.5/10)",

Black swan stars Natalie Portman, and she won an oscar for playing the character Nina Sayers in this movie. She completely deserved it because she did things in this movie that just made me say \"woah\". That's all I'm going to say about the absurd things she did in this movies, and she was amazing, probably her best performance. The conflict that Natalie Portman's character deals with is starring in a ballet performance and she becomes obsessed with this role. I won't tell you what happens to her in this movie to be spoiler free, but some stuff goes down. This movie even scared me at times. Her ballet director is kind of a creep but he completely cares about the performance and Natalie Portman's health and well being. She also has competition for this leading part and some stuff happens with that as well. Mila Kunis was also in this movie, and she actually acted really well. I don't really take her seriously as an actor, but she was really good in this movie. The ending is yet thrilling and terrifying, and the last shot in the movies says so much with so little. The script has a very good narrative and structure, and I don't think this movie gets enough praise for that. This movie definitely deserves my perfect score. 5/5",

Aronofsky has refined all of his film making knowledge and skill into this thrilling mind bender of a psychological drama. The ballet is hard, but the mindset of the dancer is the real stress inducer. Aronofsky is flexing his directorial prowess here in a magnificent display of psychological horror, drama, romance, and even the thriller genre. He uses long pans following Natalie Portman's character, close-ups, and sweeping shots to dazzle and thrill the spectator.\n\nIt is a harrowing tale of perseverance that leads perhaps all the way to insanity. Aronofsky is perhaps asking us how far will we go to achieve perfection? In art? In performance? In happiness? In love? Black Swan is a brilliant metaphor for the pursuit of artistry in a bleak and intense world. The final reveal completely shocked me. I was not expecting it at all. This movie captures so many feelings and ideas, while keeping a tight structure that propels the plot and themes. I am impressed. I think that Darren Aronofsky finally made a real masterpiece of film. Black Swan is a must see movie!\n\nClint Mansell composed the film's score as he did with Aronofsky's infamous Requiem for a Dream. He too has matured from the wild intensity of his previous sounds to the deeply moving romance and the truly epic swells with dramatic emphasis. There is a passion in the score that breaks through the sadness and the obsession to ignite a fiery finale in a wondrous sonic peak. Mansell's notes are mesmerizing in their dreamy grace.\n\nIn part, the genius of Black Swan is the captivating performances. Vincent Cassel is intense, sleazy, loving, passionate, hardcore, and desirable filled with lust all in one character. Mila Kunis is particularly enchanting as a ambitious, lustful, playful, sweet, wild, fun, powerful, and seducing foil. Barbara Hershey is striking and fearsome as Portman's overbearing and overprotective mother. The cast is excellently well chosen and deliver some of the best performances of their respective careers.\n\nAbove all, the main actress, Natalie Portman (who deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actress for Black Swan), is even more complex and engaging. She starts out a meek, yet sweet girl with big dreams of being the star ballerina. She must mature into both the good The White Swan who is graceful, elegant, sweet, and good, but also The Black Swan filled with intense passion, elegance, seduction, despair, and love. Portman plays the character of Nina beautifully, passionately, and with a mad dedication to her craft. Much like her character. She is impossible to stop looking at in Black Swan. By the finale, I was staring at her with my jaw open and tears in my eyes. Such a reaction is a rarity when I watch films. Black Swan is darkly radiant.\n\nI hope you love Black Swan as I did in all its resplendent striking aesthetic. The gorgeous make up and fantastical costumes are not the only visual delights that Black Swan have to offer. It's a dark fantasy with twisted beauty (thanks for that one, Kanye). I guarantee you have never seen any other film like Black Swan.",

He also knows how to manipulate the minds of the audience, and to control some of their emotional responses. Not to mention he was able to make Natalie Portman seem like she could act by putting her in a role where she gets to use her natural clueless/confused expression almost the entire time. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of movies that are so surreal that even the audience can\u2019t clearly determine what is happening. I appreciate the attempt to put us into the mind of the main character, and making us experience the psychosis with her, but it is so aggressive that half the time you can\u2019t trust anything you\u2019re watching. One thing that I appreciated was, although they spelled out the entire story of the ballet for us, the movie wasn\u2019t a direct one-to-one retelling of that same story. I thought for sure that setup was such an obvious ploy and it would be lazy foreshadowing, but they went a different way (only holding onto some of the bones of the story.) I think Black Swan is an artful film, and so I can see why it appeals to so many people. It\u2019s not my kind of story, particularly since everyone starts or becomes evil and unsympathetic. While I can respect the movie a lot and recognize how well it was made, it\u2019s not one that I expect to revisit.",

            "content": "Aronofsky's Oscar winning supposed psychological horror that's central around a ballet dancer who is awarded the lead role in a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. It's not strictly suited to the horror genre and you could easily watch the entire film thinking otherwise. It's certainly thrilling, but as a whole, it's a dark, subjective drama of Nina's (Portman) metamorphosis from a naive, innocence girl into dangerous womanhood. \n\nAronofsky was originally inspired by Dostoyevsky's poem, The Double and wanted to delve into a duality of personality. With this in mind then followed by seeing Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, Aronofsky spawned the story of Black Swan, having parallels to both the story and the dual role casting of Swan Lake, about a young and inexperienced girl thrown into a world of elite competitiveness, jealousy and the strive for perfection. \n\nThe narrative focuses entirely on Nina, who is chosen to play the dual lead by the manipulative, demanding and highly respected production director Thomas Leroy (Cassel). She's possibly chosen for her fragility, innocence and naivety, fitting the role of the Swan Queen, but it's her inability to play the darker psyche of the Black Swan that set her on a troublesome journey of self-exploration and sexual discovery. We witness her transition which sees her frustrations turn into fearful anger which in turn, increases her spiral into tangled paranoia and desperate madness. There's a constant battle between ambition, meticulous dedication and control versus obsession and creative fluidity in her pursuit of perfection. \n\nPortman is outstanding! Intoxicating, elegant yet stressed and is possibly her most challenging performance to date. She funded her own tough, ballet training for a year prior to the film even getting financed and lost 20lbs in the process. It won her, her first Oscar for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, and rightly deserves. \n\nCassel is brilliant as the manipulative, disapproving sexual predator who's dismissive, demanding demeanour is soul destroying, abusing his position of authority to get what he wants from his stars. Though because of the narrative, his full persona is only suggested leaving the audience to rightly assume what he's capable of. \n\nKunis is great as the alluring wild child, both alpha-female and subject of Nina's of paranoia. Is she really trying to befriend Nina or sabotage her opportunities so to make way for her own. It's hard to be sure as the story progresses, having difficulty trying to decided what is reality or imagination. Hershey was prefect as the overprotective, pampering mother who also becomes a victim of Nina's paranoia with again, the strong narrative only suggesting what could or might be real. \n\nAronofsky's style is astonishing, if not nauseating in parts. The sequences and shots are not what you might expect from a ballet performance that again only emphasises the narrative with what feels like hand held camera shots creates a fly-on-wall perspective sometimes causing that nauseous feeling that encapsulates Nina emotions. There's the added challenge of filming with so many mirrors present which must have been incredibly difficult and restrictive but also made way for some very creative shots. \n\nThe production of the film is of such a grand scale, or it certainly feels that way and it's hard to believe the film was completed on such a tight budget of a reported $13million as oppose to the hopefully $30million. The costumes, makeup and sets being much more than just that, they were very much apart of her evolution of character, especially the colour in her wardrobe throughout the film. And Clint Mansell's warped and reversed variation of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake really increases the eeriness and tone of the story. \n\nOverall, the film is a grand thriller that's a little more than just stage frightening and many might assume it's going to be boring or not going to be to their liking. But it's a dark, beautiful and captivating, superbly shot and put together with an outstanding performance from Portman. \n\nRunning Time: 8\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 10\nDirection: 9\nStory: 8\nScript: 8\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 8\nJob Description: 9\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for an outstanding production, performance and original. \n\n89% 9/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

The first act wasn't as up to par as the final two acts, but other than that I have no other complaints about this fantastic film. The score was phenomenal, and the choreography was very pleasant as well. I never thought I'd see a perfect blend of horror and beauty in one film, but Aronofsky perfectly captures that in Black Swan.",

            "content": "Nina is obsessive, threatened by fair competition, paranoid outside her knowledge base.  This is a film about that obsessive behavior, envy, and self-abuse to achieve fame and glory.  I parallel it to Aronofsky's The Wrestler, which explores similar ideas, exposing a depressing, deep in denial portrait of how individuals punish themselves to achieve stage glory and impress everyone else.\r\n\r\nAlso like The Wrestler, Aronofksy approaches the material rough, harsh, cinema-verite, though here I don't agree with it as it feels less reflective of the inner psychological portrait it's supposed to be.  The lighting style and film stock don't work with the kinds of angles, movements, and eventual edits.  It's awkward and too grainy.  It feels at times Aronofsky is hiding his points to make a more popular looking film in favor of one that's more interesting. \r\n\r\nBut the performances, expressions, and makeup are perfect.  It lends to the effect of Lily being natural for the role of Black Swan; she's a little darker, hotter, in touch with the necessary reality required to understand the role.  Nina can't depict this because she's a dramatist, a faker, an isolated compulsive dancer who only understands art outside the context of reality.  Makeup is key because it manipulates the faces to play these roles effectively.\r\n\r\nObsessive vanity has its rewards; Nina gets the part but is less liked by her peers.  The sadness is that Nina is deluding into the Black Swan character, a slow digression from obsession.  She sees herself becoming this Swan.\r\n\r\nLily in black, Nina in white, they fittingly meet in the bathroom and the dynamic is perfect.  Lily is sexually suggestive, seductive, friendly and inviting to Nina, a true angel vs devil story.  \r\n\r\nThe Director is the manipulator of the black/white, good/evil dynamic, and mediator trying to help Nina turn on her lifestyle to become the Black Swan, as suggested by his purely black and white apartment.  These colors (or lack of) are a dominant theme.  Nina's mother Erica wears black when cutting her nails.  Her bedroom is also black and white with just a hint of innocent pink, suggesting her mother's youthful treatment of her is a dangerous innocence sitting on the brink of becoming the absolutist black/white thinker Director is.  The overall palette has an interesting limit, some splashes of red added to the black, white, and pink.  Expressions of envy were captured, but where was the green to sour the obvious obsession scheme?  The problem was I didn't feel we explored beyond these obvious parameters.\r\n\r\nThe masturbation scene is terrific; as she explores this phenomenal feeling, she is inhibited by the disturbing sight of mother sleeping invasively nearby.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though this entire stage production is designed to manipulate Nina into broken innocence.  Director gropes her sexually, telling her she has to seduce him, not him to her.  Eventually, she sees him in an evil mask fucking a woman backstage.\r\n\r\nThere's some good and bad with the whole Black Swan metaphor.  The idea is beautiful, artistic for sure, but at times distracted by reaching, contrived methods.  After stabbing Lily to death and effectively becoming the Black Swan, I feel this film is best viewed as a glorified horror film, especially upon the delusion of metamorphosis.  Yet it's not that interesting, it's trite, used, not exactly a shocker.  It's more fun to believe Lily was killed and that Nina is so crazy as to have needed this to become the Black Swan.\r\n\r\nBy the time Nina throws herself off stage, it's a bit melodramatic, but a harsh stick to Director and everyone who exploited her being this way.  It cleverly fades to white, her darkness complete, now returned to the innocence with her point made.  The audience maybe deserves more, I'm not solely interested in her black and white life.  Why don't we get to see Erica, Director, and Lily react?  The perspective is narrow, the agendas of the supporting cast under-examined.  But then it is consistent with Aronofksy, ending Wrestler on a similar note, which didn't seem to need anymore than we saw.",

            "content": "\"Black Swan\" is the 2010 psychological drama film directed by Darren Aronofsky (\"The Wrestler\"), written by Andres Heinz, Mark Heyman, and John McLaughlin and starring Natalie Portman. The film's plot follows Nina (Portman) a New York Bailarina that gets cast to play both The White Sawn and The Black Swan in her ballet company's new adaptation of Swan Lake. Nina is perfect to play the fragile, innocent White Swan but struggles to play the darker more sensual Black Swan. As Nina finds herself trying to capture the essence of the challenging role, she discovers it to be harder than she thought. The supporting cast includes Mila Kunis as Lily, Vince Cassel as Thomas, Barbara Hershey as Nina's mom, Erica, and Winona Ryder as Beth.\n\n\"Black Swan\" is a beautiful film that delivers the thrills with one of the (if not the) best performance of 2010. The filmmakers explore deep into character, distancing itself from a plot that focuses more on the story to a plot that makes its main character the central piece, the plot. The film's main theme is the study of Nina's psychological and physical struggles, as she tries and achieves perfection in her role as The Black Swans. A metaphor of sorts, the film shows us Nina getting worst and worst, day by day, getting constant hallucinations, many times seeing a hostile, darker self (much like the Black Swan) trying to somehow take over her. This can be interpreted as simply Nina's obvious pressure for a difficult role. Nina being this fragile sweet girl, who's perfect for the role of White Swan, trying her hardest to become someone else. This other version of herself, in her dreams and hallucinations, is the Black Swan, slowly taking over Nina, Nina embraces this other self, aiming for perfection, which comes with its price. Her hallucinations in which Lily appears could represent the possible sexual attraction Nina had towards her, that would later transform into a feeling of anger and rivalry as Lily eventually becomes Nina's alternate in Swan Lake. It could be that Nina never had any hallucinations, it was simply the beauty of filmmaking, as Nina's humongous pressure is shown through visual imagery or hallucinations.\n\nAronofsky captures the film's scenes greatly, the ballet scenes being especially beautiful. Using Light, sound, fantastic music and amazing camera work to his favor, Aronofsky shoots beautiful scenes, that I wish lasted longer in the film. The film's music is beautiful with both Aronofsky and the film's original composer, Clint Mansell, basing the film's music on the ballet's original music composed by legendary composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. But none of these scenes would be so great without the inclusion of the beautiful ballet, with gorgeous choreography and beautiful costume designs with the camera playing a fundamental part in these scenes, as Aronofsky puts us up close to the actors making the scenes even better with that extra touch of directing.\n\nTough the one thing that overcomes all, the complicated, well putt together theme, the beautifully staged scenes, and everything else is, Natalie Portman. The actress is here, how no one has seen her before. Already growing up doing hard demanding roles since the beginning of her career with the likes of  \"L\u00e9on: the professional\" and \"Heat\" to then get older and act in even more complex features such as \"V for Vendetta\", \"Closer\" and \"Brothers\" to only then, get to what in my opinion is her best work to date in \"Black Swan\". Portman is simply fantastic in here, the actress is flawless playing the fragile, complex and great character of Nina, doing great in every scene including the beautiful ballet scenes for which the actress took lessons to perform. Opposite to Vicent Cassel, in some of the film's most memorable, character-driving and sensual scenes in the film, the actress does great, and the duo shines in some of the film's best scenes. Also opposite to Portman is Mila Kunis, the actress that usually puts her talents to work in comedy, surprises, too giving a great performance, with some scenes alongside Portman showing the actress' undoubtable talent for drama.\n\n\"Black Swan\" is, as said, a beautiful film with great character study, beautiful production design, fantastic directing of Darren Aronofsky, a stellar cast that does a fantastic job and Natalie Portman in her best performance yet, one that will be hard to be beaten, that only makes me even more excited for Portman's future work. 4.5/5.",

It is also about letting go. Surprise yourself so you can surprise the audience. Transcendence. Few have it in them.\"\n\nForgive my English translator google",

I took off half a star because of the nightclub scene. I understand why it's in the film, but I feel like it's a focus for far too long and is by far the weakest part of the movie as a whole, and I feel like the filmmakers could have made the same point in a much more effective way and been shorter than if they had focused on two friends getting drinks.

This all builds up to a thrilling climax that hits hard, and mostly compensates for the unevenness preceding. \n\nThat is to say that the Black Swan is not without its faults. The body horror, while successful in its shock value, does go a little too far in places. I also didn't care too much for the CGI near the end, serving only to beleaguer a point that  would have been better off subtler in line with the rest of the film.

Unlike films such as \"Memento\", where you are intentionally left having to make your own conclusions, which can be frustrating.\n\nThe acting is top notch and the subtleties as the protagonist falls deeper into mental darkness despite her professional success are spectacular.

His simplistic use of special effects, extreme close ups and tight camera angles, plummets us into the deliriously dark reaches of the fragile mind. \n\nDedicated New York corps-de-ballet dancer Nina (Natalie Portman) lives a sheltered life. Fuelled by her retired overbearing stage-mother's (Barbara Hershey) obsessions, Nina's life is completely consumed by her profession and her ambitious dreams to be elevated to the companies lead prima-ballerina.\n\nWhen artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) announces that the new seasons opening production will not only be his own new visceral version of Swan Lake, but also the launch of a fresh face, na\u00efve Nina's dreams finally seem within reach. \n\nHis immediate first choice, Nina is a shoe in to replacing Leroy's 'little princes' previous prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Beth (Winona Ryder). However, his reservations for Nina in the character as Swan Queen lie within her ability to transform in the duel role as required. \n\nA perfect fit as the fragile, innocent and graceful White Swan Odette, Nina is too reserved to embrace the guile and sensuality of its darker nemesis and convert into the mistress of deception Odile, the Black Swan. \n\nTaunting her as frigid, afraid to let herself go and confined by boundaries, Leroy attempts to bring out the inner Odile with an exercise in seduction. However her continuing internal conflict is amplified when Lily (Mila Kunis) joins the corps. \n\nDirect opposites; Lily is the personification of fun-loving, dramatic passion. Her naturally relaxed raunchiness and noticeable attraction to Leroy compounds Nina's obsession with the perfect performance.  Their need-to-impress rivalry blossoms into a twisted friendship with Lily temping Nina to loosen up with sex, drugs and booze. \n\nA savage triumph, Nina is finally able to tap into her dark-side. Her hallucinatory behaviour leads to a recklessness abandonment that threatens to destroy not only her career but her life.\n\nPerfectly cast this production is well deserving of its five Oscar nominations. The delicate, beautiful and vulnerable features of Natalie Portman are finally put to good use in the role of her career. Stunningly believable as a tortured soul, Natalie is a shock to the system to watch. \n\nBarbara Hershey is terrifyingly malevolent, Winona Ryder is chillingly anguished, Mila Kunis is full of every freedom-loving expression and Vincent Cassel oozes the required smarminess whilst still being able to deliver the depth of a nurturing mentor. \n\nThe verdict: Dark and disturbing, this striking film delves into the terrifying depths of the human mind. As life imitates art the lines between reality and fantasy often become blurred.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 04/02/2011",

            "content": "Stepping into familiar territory, Aronofsky crafts, yet another wonderful psychological drama, which although split audience opinion, ultimately solidified itself, critically, as an essential genre piece. Nina is a fragile and tormented ballet dancer, who strikes it lucky when her dance company decides to drop its main star, in favor of a younger face, for its massive production of Swan Lake. Overwhelmed by her position, Nina soon buckles under the pressure and the production is thrown into turmoil, as Nina struggles to differentiate between reality and imagination. Black Swan is very much a character piece, with its success purely dependent on lead actress Natalie Portman, who thankfully does a wonderful job, bringing the character of Nina so perfectly to life, Portman actually vanishes as Nina takes the fore front. Its a stunning performance, that merges dangerous desperation, with a fragility that is heart braking to watch. That's  not to say the rest of the cast do a bad job, Cassell, Kunis and Hershey do a grand job, supplying a host of melodramatic, but essential characters for Nina to surround herself with, however Winona Ryder may actually be the best casting, in a long time, with her brief but wonderful performance as Beth, the washed up star who is dropped in favor of Nina, it's a genius decision to cast an actress who once had the world at her finger tips, and her performance steps Black Swan up a few notches. It's a wonderful, stylistic affair, with Aronofsky injecting a brilliant and invigorating sense of psychosis, Black Swan looks utterly stunning from start to finish, blurring the lines between reality with some bizarre visual effects and make up work. Impressive moments see Nina transform, as she glides through her performance, with shimmering wings and blood red eyes, it's visually arresting to witness her transformation, made even more powerful by Portman's ability to hammer home a sterling performance. Black Swan can at points feel like your stuck in a whirlwind and by the end, you will feel slightly thrown about and pretty disorientated, however upon multiple viewings, clarity will start to prevail. The script does at points feel rather forced, with some cringe worthy dialogue floating about from time to time, and although the film is well orchestrated, it does feel like a selection of scenes could have been added to strengthen its overall presentation. Overall, Black Swan is hardly ground braking, however Aronofsky's ability to craft a visually stunning and emotionally charged, psychological piece, with superb performances and a wonderful score, makes Black Swan a true accomplishment in film making.",

            "content": "I have a beautiful relationship with Art. It has enriched my life, molded my views and my psyche. Well, basically, it is the same case with most of the people, the audience. Why? Because, we are viewers, from afar, not inside it. Because of what goes on behind it, how it makes or breaks lives? For, an Artist, the Art is his/her life and vice versa. The lines between the two are blurred, and your Art slowly consumes you. It can be great for some, destructive for some, and for some rare souls, both of it at once.\n\nIt is a pure relationship, the one between the Art and the Artist. And Darren Aronofsky has brilliantly explored this relationship, with the 2010 psychological drama Black Swan. The story of Nina Sayers, and her poetic relationship with her art, Ballet, is ever so subtlety portrayed on the silver screen by Aronofsky, the man behind poignant psychological drama like Pi and The Fountain. The movie opened to universal critical acclaim, and was nominated for five Academy Awards, and Natalie Portman went on to receive the Best Actress for her bold performance as Nina.\n\nA famous New York company is looking for a fresh ballerina for its production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake Ballet. The ballerina will have the challenging task of playing the contrasting characters of the Black Swan and the White Swan. Nina is the perfect pick for the beautiful and ethereal White Swan, but she is unable to grasp the dark and sensual Black Swan. Things take a turn for the worse when her role is threatened by the newly-arrived Lily (Mila Kunis). From there on, it is a downward spiral with Nina's hallucinations and the reality gets jumbled and she slowly loses grip of reality.\n\nThere is something uniquely magnetizing about how Aronofsky brings out his scenes. It is not a pretty picture, with its themes of horror, fear and desperation, but you just can't look away, because it is so tastefully done. Ballet, itself plays an important role here, and Aronofsky captures it with a sad elegance. You know how this is all going to end, but that is not the point. It is about how Nina's life is slowly unraveling and disintegrating herself and all we can do is helplessly sit and watch. It is a powerful emotion, despair, and Aronofsky plays that card with quite an effect. The cinematography is dark, yet beautifully done. There is so much emotional disintegration around, but it all feels so visually beautiful and that makes it scary. The music, too complements the tone and tenor the film adopts.\n\nOf course, you can't put it in words, but I will still talk about Natalie Portman. From the \"Damsel in Distress\" in the Star Wars flicks, she has really matured as an actress. And with Nina Sayers, she has produced an absolute gem, a character with so much pain in her eyes, it is heart wrenching. Her porcelain face is laced with a plethora of emotions and her character successfully depicts the behind-the-scenes pains and agony of any performing artist. It is by far the bets female performance of this decade! Brilliant.\n\nBlack Swan is brilliantly written, acted and directed. It is a haunting examination of life on a stage, which slowly rips apart your soul in the elusive quest for one unattainable prize -\n\n    Perfection!",

Natalie Portman's masterful turn as a ballet performer obsessed with perfection is only tempered by her unwilling transformation into the Black Swan as she destroys the relationships around her.  The beautiful Barbara Hershey turns in a chilling performance as the unbalanced, overprotective mother living vicariously through her daughters accomplishments.  Sadly , Mila Kunis, though not underutilized as an antagonist, receives little screen time as a dancer.  As always, Cassel shines as a villainous instructor.  The cinematography was balanced and the lighting was superb.  As one crew member put it, Swan Lake is the tragic story of a Wer-Swan.  For the first time, Aranofsky gives us a true glimpse into that horror story.  Highly recommended.",

While Requiem For A Dream was a bit to abstract for the average viewer and Noah went the way of many horrible blockbusters before it, Black Swan seems to balance the drama and the abstract nature of Aronofsky's directing, due no doubt, in large part to the magnetic and possibly career best performances from Portman and Kunis, who completely carry the film, drawing us in with their well developed and well acted characters. Portman in particular is excellent as the desperate Nina, whose psychological battles are gripping. A well crafted film in every department.",

It is through her determination and crumbling grip on reality, that we see the lines between art and life blur. \n\nSolid supporting performances across the board, particularly from Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey, add a wonderful dynamic to our protagonist's world. And it is a world that is both painfully suffocating (her bedroom resembles that of a ten-year-old's) and exceptionally cruel; the texture of both the city and rehearsal space are purposely harsh. Recurring motifs of flesh (note the emphasis on Portman's perturbing ribs and small bust), nails, blood and mirrors reinforce this, and there's such care in the costume design that we are able to understand so much about the company, their personalities and their relationship with one another. \n\nComplimented by a stunning score and cinematography, 'Black Swan' is one of the most honest portrayals of mental illness in a very long time.",

When manages to land the part unexpectedly (and with allegations that she had to favour the director to get the job) Nina begins a shocking spiral into madness as the pressure of the situation begins to come down on her. Not helping the situation is the arrival of Lily, a new member of the company who aspires to Nina's role.\n\nThe role of Nina is played stunningly by Natalie Portman, and in a film filled with well-designed bits her acting is still the clear highlight. It is certainly no surprise that Portman took home the Oscar for this film. Among her supporting cast are such names as Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Winona Ryder and Sebastian Shan, with every cast member bringing out memorable performances - as is often the case in an Aronofsky film.\n\nIt's a highly unsettling film, and it certainly isn't a film that you can just casually watch - something which I'm sure confused an entire demographic who was in the theatre to see THAT scene.

However, tensions start rising up when Thomas (Vincent Cassel) wants Nina to give 100 percent even though she keeps trying to do that, and also when Lily (Mila Kunis) starts showing up to ballet. I've been a fan of Darren Aronofsky's work, and I remember loving this movie, but since it's been a long time that I've watched it, I don't remember much about why I love Black Swan. When I got to watching it, now I understand why. Natalie Portman is fantastic in acting like an innocent girl that gets more and more released out of herself as the film progresses, and she's also talented in dancing too that I'm glad that she won an Oscar for it. Vincent Cassel does a good job of acting like a total d-bag that only wanted the best out of the main performer. Mila Kunis is also great in it as a bit of a seductive girl that plays it in a way that the main character feels cautious around. The score by Clint Mansell is amazing that definitely fits with the tone of the film, and the musical Swan Lake itself. The plot is really good that there are still parts of the film that were unpredictable. The writing by Andres Heinz, Mark Heyman, and John McLaughlin is very well written that creates some memorably complex characters. The direction by Darren Aronofsky is well shotted, and when it got to the ending, it was very unexpected, but it's satisfying to know where it was going that it lead to an amazing ending. Black Swan is a masterpiece that it's one of the best films of 2010.",

It was one of the most talked about and sought after films at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, and for good reason - it is a masterpiece that is just as much beautiful as it is nightmarish. The film not only ended up as the best film at TIFF but the best film of the year. It also went onto win lots of awards, most notabally for Natalie Portman who actually won the Oscar for best perforance by an actress in a leading role. I must admit, this is the second Darren Aronofsky film I have seen, the other being this years 'Noah' which I thought was a very flawed film. This, however, is flawless and not only has semeneted Aronofsky as an extremly talented director, not only for his impeccable visual style but for the fact that he also does a brilliant job of creating the world that these characters inhabit.\n\nThis film reminded me of all the terrible parts of my theater days. The backstabbing, the trash talking, and the two faced nature of that world is portrayed with a deft and brilliant touch. There is a constant fear that you are one mistake away from losing not only your part, but your future parts as well. You feel like you are a part of this world, that he pressure of it is part of your world.\n\nThe camera work is great and very affective. The somewhat jittery, close hand-held shots are perfect and pull you deeper into this world than may be comfortable. He has definitley shown he confidence behind the camera with this picture and it's a very finly directed piece. He too seeks perfection in his work, finding the right camera angles, the right tempo, and the right composition. This film has some incrediable camera work, thanks to the cinematography of DP Matthew Libatique, whose fluid camera movements are the glue that hold the film together. It's a very stunning film to look at, a visual treat I would say. A",

            "content": "\"I felt it.  It was perfect.\" Nina (Natalie Portman) whispers as she closes her performance as the Swan Queen in \"Swan Lake\".  After years of dancing with technical perfection rather than emotion, Nina loses both her mind and her life in an attempt to \"feel\" her performance instead of simply \"doing\" it.  At the beginning of the film, she is a reflection of the white swan - fragile, virginal, and na\u00efve - but by the end, she succumbs to her inner destructive self, transforming into the sinful character that is the Black Swan.\n\tBallet is a beautiful dance from an outside perspective, with its glassy smooth delicacy and intricate direction.  \"Black Swan\" gives us a portrait of the inside, one that may be over-dramatized for film, but still manages to remind us that the beauty presented to us is shallow enough to crumble right beneath our fingertips.  We find that, in the world of ballet, there is more to it than just stunning atmosphere.  There is a great deal of torture, and through Nina, we live through it in the most extreme sense.\n\tNina has been dancing her entire life - it's hard to tell if she truly loves it, or if she is forced to do it because her domineering mother (Barbara Hershey) enforces it.  She is a grown woman, yet the two live together.  At first, it appears to be a happy relationship, but once we come to notice that Nina's room is painted pink and decked out with stuffed animals, and her mother doesn't seem to have any friends of her own, it's clear that Nina is living in a twisted sort of psychological prison that seems to be even more dangerous than a real one.\n\tAt the moment, her life revolves around the local production of \"Swan Lake\".  When she dances, we can see her veins twitching as she takes every precaution needed to move with flawlessness, but there is no true heart - she is unable to let loose from her mind, which seems to be controlled by the cage of pressure that her mother locks her in.  Her instructor, Tomas (Vincent Cassell), is intrigued, both wanting to sleep with her and unlock her self-conscious mindset - also fascinated is Lily (Mila Kunis), a newbie that walks on the wild side of life.  Nina is caught in the middle of a sick game of tug-of-war, unsure if she should listen to the temptation that lies within the bodies of Lily and Tomas, or stay the helpless child her mother wants her to be.  \t\n\tIn the process, she descends into a madness that would make Ingrid Bergman in \"Gaslight\" proud.\n\tVisually, \"Black Swan\" is a triumph in combining icy beauty with utter grotesqueness, reminiscent of Dario Argento's Technicolor horror stylings in the 1970s.  There are one too many close-ups of the feet of the dancers, close-ups that are so close-up that we can hear every snap, crackle, and pop they make, which takes away the feathery lightness we originally see and replaces it with something akin to a sick sort of torture.  Portman's bone-skinny frame is a reminder that the life of a ballerina is not an easy one, rather one that requires discipline seen by few.\n\tBut the discipline shown by Portman, Kunis, and Darren Aronofsky is tremendously impressive - Portman is a knockout as Nina, capturing her transition from, as her mother would say, a sweet girl to a girl who cannot get ahold of her mind.  Portman trained for months to look and act like a ballerina, and the results are game-changing - the dedication she shows on screen is something to applaud, as she becomes a soul so tortured by everything around her that we forget that this is the same actress who made her breakthrough as a tough-talking little girl in \"L\u00e9on: The Professional\", the same actress who achieved franchise fame in the resurrection of the \"Star Wars\" series.  \n\tKunis is a perfect foil for Portman, utilizing her dark looks and magnetic personality to mirror the bad-girl personality the Black Swan possesses.  We are just as easily seduced by her as Nina is - we want to take a stroll with her on the blackened side of the spectrum, without hesitation.  And Aronofsky, who for years has made films that harness the same sort of black magic \"Black Swan\" wears on its sleeve, lets Nina's self-destruction take its time, adding a constant unsettling aura that is unshakable.\n\t\"Black Swan\" is just disturbing enough to sit with us for days, making for an operatic, melodramatic film experience that is just as stunning as \"Swan Lake\" itself.",

This film really is not for the faint-hearted and there are moments where it will make you cringe, even if it is about rehearsing for \"Swan Lake,\" the beloved Tchaikovsky ballet.  Portman is great here and she really does take you down a troubled path.  She is innocent as Nina/White Swan but shows her aggressive/troubled side when playing the Black Swan.

Just in time as one of the best ballerinas in her studio is retiring, she gets a part as the Swan Queen in a new version of Swan Lake where she will have to play both the White and the Black Swan. The 'director' (I guess that's what you call him) thinks Nina is perfect for the White Swan, but that she needs to work a lot more if she wants to be perfect as both. The whole movie is basically Nina trying to accept her dark and mature side, the Black Swan. I won't spoil the ending, but it was very fitting and emotional. The acting was brilliant! Everyone, even Mila Kunis, did a great job portraying their characters. I do have to point out Natalie Portman's performance as she was amazing as Nina! The characters, on the other hand, are a bit unlikeable. I didn't find myself actually caring for any of the characters. The cinematography and the special effects used to make the Black Swan transformations were epic. The movie looks and feels dark and disturbing.

With Portman constantly being told to be perfect, her mental state slowly deteriorates into a truly haunting persona that is the Swan Queen. Aronofsky's attention to the subtleties that make this a truly haunting tale is the closest I have seen to a true Kubrick-ian film since Kubrick's passing. That is what horror and suspense is to me. It's not about jump-scares and gore. It's about the build up of tension and the little details. A film that needs to be watched more than once.",

Black Swan focuses on a dancer called Nina, whose psyche becomes corrupt as she undertakes the role of the black swan which takes over her life, taking her on an intense descent to a dark side that threatens to consume her. Natalie Portman's dedication to the role shows, her innocence is shattered as the Swan Lake show comes closer, and the way she changes from sweet girl to a frighteningly perfect incarnation of the Black Swan is incredible to watch. Barbara Hershey is amazing as Nina's over protective and zealous mother, Hershey is overbearing in such a pitch perfect way that she's actually terrifying, and Mila Kunis is a revelation as Nina's competition Lily. Surprisingly scary, intelligent and constantly atmospheric, Black Swan is one intense film with perfect scores in every department.",

            "content": "Continuing my roast of Darren Aronofsky, we have Black Swan. This movie has become famous (or infamous) for its weird, surreal look inside the mind of a prima ballerina, and for a lesbian sex scene between Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman precisely 69 minutes into the movie. Yeah, I bet that was a coincidence. Anyway, although this movie has gotten widespread acclaim for its supposedly \"haunting\" visuals, it's really not that scary nor intelligent. All it does is show the audience a bunch of weirdly shot scenes, coupled with some spooky atmospherics, and expects the audience to read some meaning or emotion into it, despite the fact that the proceedings are incredibly vapid.\r\n\r\nBlack Swan's greatest asset (and the thing that sets it apart from other Aronofsky fails) is Natalie Portman, who proves herself to be a legitimately good actress here. She has great panicked facial expressions, delivers the lines with just the right amount of uncertainty and caution, and is all-around very likable. However, this is just because she's Natalie Portman, and she'll be likable in anything (except when her hair is a corkscrew and she's saying shit like \"I will not condone a course of action that will lead to war\"). The character herself is given very little to actually connect with the audience with, and Portman basically just rides her charm as best as she can. That is all that can really be done with a script as deliberately weird and shallow as this one. The movie focuses far more on developing a weird series of events than actually delving into the tortured main character, making this whole psychosexual freakout far less engaging than it should be.\r\n\r\nA lot of this movie makes no sense-- and no, not because I didn't understand it. Because Aronofsky throws completely random scenes in that have absolutely no bearing on the story. Some guy on the subway made a lewd gesture at Natalie Portman. Okay... cool. Why do we care? And when it comes down to it, her whole obsession with Mila Kunis's character is chaotic and makes no sense. There is very little intelligence in this movie, but it does have a lot of emotion, which I can't completely write off. But there is a totally random lesbian scene between Kunis and Portman. Not complaining... but why? It's totally random within the context of the story. Sure, Portman is becoming obsessed with her. We get that. But why would it manifest itself this way? Sexual tension, I suppose? The reasoning behind Portman's hallucinations is left open-ended far too many times for them to hold water.\r\n\r\nAs always, Aronofsky is a master at creating vivid and unnerving imagery, but he puts far too much effort into concocting the nightmarish world of the movie than actually putting some effort into its substance. There are some truly chilling shots, namely one in which Portman's reflection moves out of sync with her, and another in which she sprouts swan wings. But her whole \"transformation\" verges too far on the silly side sometimes. The scene where her legs buckle into the shape of a swan's legs is weird, but could also elicit some chuckles from the audience, mainly because the ludicrousness of the premise has caught up with the film's self-importance. Weirdness will only get you so far, but just being creepy for the sake of creepiness does not signify depth or meaning. It just means that you've made a somewhat above-average, soft horror movie masquerading as a psychological thriller.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Black Swan: 5/10 stars. This film is actually not that bad, and certainly the most inherently watchable of the Aronofsky films I've seen. It has some very good qualities to it, and several scenes that actually start to approach the level of genius that Aronofsky thinks he possesses. Sadly though, the film is inevitably weighed down by a generic script, bland characterization, a pointlessly weird plot, and (of course) a sense of self-importance that forces the audience to put up with some exceedingly pretentious sequences. I'd love to give this a higher score, as I actually enjoyed watching it (no Cutler, not just the lesbian scene, we are not all pervs like you), but I understand that it's still not a very good film. It's just a mediocre exercise in atmospherics over story, and although the visuals (coupled with Natalie Portman's powerful performance) are worth seeing it for, it doesn't hold a candle to the other psychological thrillers it so desperately wants to imitate.",

            "content": "Black Swan is such an overrated movie! I don't understand the hype surrounding this film; it's really nothing to write home about. Black Swan is probably in my list of top 10 overrated movies. Black Swan is about a prima ballerina, Nina Sayer (played by Natalie Portman) whose biggest ambition is to get the lead role of both the black and white swan in Swan Lake. However she faces competition against Lily (Mila Kunis) who brings out Nina's dark side. At least one good thing about the film is that it portrays the harsh ballet industry and the drive for perfection. Nina strives to be perfect and devotes herself to ballet completely, but the pressure drives her insane to the point she self harms and throws up.\r\n\r\nHowever this really isn't my kind of film at all. I just found it too bleak and depressing and void of emotion. I just felt that I didn't connect with the film, I felt distant. I found Natalie Portman a little wooden, even though she's meant to be really frigid in her role as Nina who is really reserved and under the thumb of her controlling mother Erica (Barbara Hershey). Mila Kunis however was really outstanding; she's always so full of energy and sparkle. She really has such great presence; Mila Kunis is really a great actress much better than overrated Natalie Portman. Barbara Hershey was really strong too and portrayed the role as Nina's overbearing mother really well. Vincent Cassel is also really good as Nina's ballet coach, Thomas Leroy who tries to seduce her as he does to many of the girls. It shows than in those type of industries that shagging the boss is the way to go. One of Leroy's former students and prodigees Beth (Winona Ryder) is bitter that he discarded her and made her end her ballet career and tells Nina to \"enjoy it whilst it lasts.\" Winona Ryder was surprisingly really good in her role, I never had her down as a good actress.\r\n\r\nEven though the acting was good I just didn't really like the story. I just felt like it tried to portray too many meanings to the audience but actually lacked substance. A lot of it I found really confusing and it just leaves the audience guessing all the time; did she imagine that or was it real? It is suggested in the film that Nina is schizophrenic as she hallucinates a lot of the time. I do think that the film does portray mental illness really well though. I found some of the scenes a bit too disturbing. I remember seeing it in the cinema and it was much worse on the big screen; I had to cover my eyes through most of it. I saw this again this evening as it was on telly and I thought maybe I'd change my opinion as I last saw it like 3 years ago. I just found Black Swan too dark and dreary to sit through. I also felt the film tried too hard as well to convey some sort of meaning and be clever, but it's all been done before. I'm not a fan of ballet either if I'm being honest and plus I hate swans, they freak me out. If you like dark psychological thrillers/horrors or anything with Natalie Portman, you'll enjoy this. It's not a terrible film, but not my cup of tea. Then again each to their own, I just tend not to like overrated movies.\r\n\r\nGrade: C-/D+",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\nWell, Natalie Portman took some advice from Christian Bale.  She lost 20 pounds and learned a few dance moves just to get this role.  Too bad she wasted he time, in my opinion.  Black Swan is directed by Darren Aronofsky, who did the atrocious Pi.  I have yet to decide whether that film was worse than Juno or not.  Yeah, it's that bad.  However, being the generous guy I am, I gave Aronofsky another shot with the Wrestler, and that film didn't disappoint.  It was a rather dark take on professional wrestling and it didn't try to add any weird special effects.  It was a pure drama.  Unfortunately, Darren went back to his roots with Black Swan.  If this were a simple random look at the stress of ballerinas, this film could have been great.  However, it goes for \"creepy\" visuals.  What a shame Aronofsky!  I liked the Wrestler.\n\nBlack Swan is about the tale of a ballerina (Natalie Portman), who is driven insane by all the things around her.  Her mother is stressing her to become a better ballerina.  And as soon as there is an opening spot in the new play Swan Lake, Nina has a shot.  However, she has competition as well in another ballerina (Mila Kunis).  In order to get the role, you have to be both innocent (Portman) and vicious (Kunis).  It soon leads to Nina going nuts and becoming twisted.  The cast, besides Winona Ryder, Mila Kunis, and Portman, are all no-names.  It's not like the no names can't act, but.....yeah, they can't act.\n\nThe point of the film is to shock and see what's inside the mind of Portman's character, but it fails on both accounts.  Yeah, Portman does see some \"creepy\" imagery, but it holds no weight because it's just so laughably acted and handled.  The little shocking moments left me straight face.  I didn't go \"OH MY GOD!\" like Aronofsky wanted the audience to do.  Portman's \"complex\" character is really one-note.  I was completely uninterested in her and for a moment, I literally forgot she was the main character.  Mila Kunis is a terrible actress, who made it in Hollywood cause of her good looks (Dare you to see her without makeup.  It's scary).  Here, she drives this point straight to the ground.  Throughout the entire film, all I saw was Meg (Family Guy) speaking.  She couldn't have changed her voice in the slightest?  She has this annoying voice that makes my ears bleed.  What was the casting director thinking?\n\nThen, there's the fact that the first 40-50 minutes of this film actually have no substance.  Matter of fact, the script is yet another hollow, boring, pretentious piece of garbage (Notice that I didn't cuss).  We were supposed to see how dark Portman's character was and feel for her.  However, she (as mentioned in paragraph 2) is just boring.  It doesn't help that she played the role exactly as how I said it.  Also, there is a classic mistake of underusing Winona Ryder.  It's also a melodrama.  I honestly don't understand what this movie was trying to be: a psychological thriller or a melodrama!  It leaves off on of those for the other.  Then, it comes back to the other.  It really makes me wonder whether that was the point or not.  However, when you go from trying to scare us to trying to make us feel sympathetic towards the character, it doesn't work.\n\nOverall, Aronofsky, you have disappointed me, again!  Whereas the Wrestler wasn't trying to be some creepy, edgy horror/drama, this film does.  It's basically Pi times 10 with ecstacy, only that ecstacy turns out to be poison.  It does nothing new, follows some cliches in the genre, and very pretentious.  It believed it was of some higher being that most other psychological thrillers yet it fails.  Oh, and like most, it attempted to confuse us with many scenes, but all those scenes only hurt the plot flow, making this film literally confusing.....on purpose.  The reason why it gets the better than Juno seal is very simple.  There's a nice lesbian scene thrown it, even though it holds no significance to the plot.  \n\n1/10",

The dance choreography is beautifully put together, and Portman's commitment to that part of the role as well as her commitment to the character attests to her as an actress. The imagery is so visceral and the pacing adds to the atmosphere. Seeing how each of the principle supporting characters have their role in Nina's fall from sanity is so interesting and entertaining. The way Nina is portrayed is not only well developed enough to allow us to sympathize with her, but enough to feel like we're on this journey with her. That's the movie's strength, you're not just watching as this girl is being driven insane, you're on the journey with her, you feel like the world she's creating in her mind is real just like she does. THATS how well put together it is. I got so attached to this movie that my jaw dropped several times while watching this. If I have any complaint, I guess it would be that some of the camerawork is distracting, but this is just a nitpick. Other than that, bravo and bravo. \n9.6 out of 10",

The story works very well, because it's littered with symbolism, and is basically a concoction of dark themes. One thing I've noticed is that the two most common themes are self-harm (the main character apparently having damaged her own body) and the pressure to succeed (where else could her hallucinations be coming from?). Whatever it is, it's a source of genuine horror, not like the fake horror you find in today's horror movies. Yes, even though it's technically a psychological thriller, I consider it a psychological horror movie because what you see is quite striking. Overall, it's really a brilliant example of horror done right, but it's the kind of film that after seeing it once, I wouldn't be too keen on seeing another time, just because I wouldn't like the idea of going through all that again.

A Fox Searchlight Pictures release by visionary director Darren Aronofsky (THE WRESTLER), BLACK SWAN takes a thrilling and at times terrifying journey through the psyche of a young ballerina whose starring role as the duplicitous swan queen turns out to be a part for which she becomes frighteningly perfect. BLACK SWAN follows the story of Nina (Portman), a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her retired ballerina mother Erica (Barbara Hershey) who zealously supports her daughter,s professional ambition. When artistic director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side with a recklessness that threatens to destroy her. -- (C) Official Site\nMy Review\nA sumptuous, exhilarating and disturbing examination of the thin line between genius and madness and the lengths to which an artist will go to achieve perfection, Black Swan cements Darren Aronofsky's place as one of the most important filmmakers working in cinema today.\n\nSomething of a companion piece to his last release - The Wrestler - the film substitutes backwater wrestling rings for the New York ballet and the suplex for the pirouette, but retains the sense of desperation felt by the main character in their chosen profession.\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, that character is Nina, an ambitious dancer determined to win the lead role in a forthcoming reinvention of Swan Lake. But while her innocence and frailty make Nina favourite to play the white swan, those same traits make her a less likely candidate to play the flip-side of that character, the titular black swan.\n\nThe company's artistic director Thomas teases and goads her into unlocking that dark side, bullying Nina to stir her anger and making sexual advances that bring out her sensuality.\n\nShe duly wins the role, but Nina's efforts to craft the perfect performance see her losing herself in the part, fantasy and reality merging to create terrifying hallucinations that begin to threaten her sanity.\n\nMatters aren't helped by the arrival of Lily - a sexually uninhibited dancer from San Francisco who is the polar opposite to Nina, and who may or may not have designs on her role.\n\nTeetering on the edge of madness, lust, paranoia, frustration, and jealousy build as the pressure on Nina intensifies, culminating in a stunning finale which takes place on opening night, when the world is finally introduced to her black swan, and when all her worst fears are realised.\n\n\nMore Black Swan Videos\n\n\nIt's a flamboyant, grandstanding finale, Aronofsky creating a breathless waking nightmare that's as powerful and affecting as anything he has previously shot; high praise indeed when you consider what he achieved with Requiem for a Dream.\n\nIndeed everyone seems to be at the top of their game on this one. Cinematographer Matthew Libatique shoots proceedings with a real sense of urgency, brilliantly bringing out Nina's confused duality through a clever use of mirrors, and creating a genuine sense of claustrophobia by liberally employing the close-up.\n\nArt direction is similarly stunning, the colour scheme an effective combination of blacks, whites and greys, apart from the child-like Nina's bedroom, which is variations of pink.\n\nAnd long-time Aronofsky collaborator Clint Mansell hits one out of the park again with the score, taking Tchaikovsky's music and turning it into something quite disturbing. Credit should similarly go to the sound team's work with breaking bones and tearing skin; noises which perfectly complement the body-horror appearing on screen.\n\nIt's a slightly different tale in terms of performance however. Vincent Cassel has fun as the sexual predator Thomas, and while it feels like we've seen his character many times before, he's never less than watchable on screen.\n\n\n\n\nMila Kunis also seems to be enjoying herself as Lily, black swan to Nina's white. Her role is somewhat underwritten, but she certainly makes an impression, no-more-so than in the much-talked-about lesbian romp, the film's most low-brow, high-trash moment.\n\nBarbara Hershey fares less well as Nina's mother, the ultimate pushy parent. Initially intriguing, living out her dreams through her daughter and overprotective to the point that she even dresses her, Hershey's characterisation quickly turns into caricature, too over-the-top even for a movie this manic.\n\nBut Black Swan is Natalie Portman's film, and she delivers the performance of her career as Nina. It's no surprise that the camera loves her, but this may be her most subtle and nuanced work yet, perfectly capturing Nina's physical and mental meltdown.\n\nIt's a performance that burns with intensity, one that anchors the film in reality when it threatens to slip into melodrama, and one that will doubtless be rewarded come awards season in the same way that Mickey Rourke cleaned up with The Wrestler two years ago.\n\nCombined with Aronofsky's brilliance behind the camera, the result is a stunning assault on the senses that defies convention - an art film masquerading as horror; a Giallo with Best Picture aspirations.\n\nAnd if the first hour is an entertaining-if-hardly-groundbreaking examination of the struggle for perfection in art, it's elevated by the final half-hour, an astounding sequence that has to be seen to be believed; cinema of the very purest form that is, in-its-own way, pretty much perfect which is why I give Black Swan a 4.5 out of 5.",

            "content": "And now to the movie. I honestly can't say I liked it as a whole because I didn't. Personally, I found it to be a little underwhelming but I guess I have all the hype surrounding it to thank for that. This is certainly a companion piece to Aronofsky's last film, The Wrestler, in that it unflinchingly presents the toils and rigors of a profession not too well known by today's masses. In both films it seems that in order to achieve desired effects and results one must primarily undergo extreme physical pain and bodily deformities that are hidden by costumes and not seen by audiences. Split fingernails, bruises, broken bones, steroids, bulimia, fucking your boss,  you name it, wrestlers and ballerinas will do it. I'm pretty sure you'd have to be a little nuts just to attempt doing either one on a professional level. Both professions are dog eat dog and just the psychological toll to get to the top and stay on top alone must be exhausting and I can see why it would make for interesting material for a movie. Such was the case with The Wrestler  and now presently the case with Black Swan. I deeply commend Aronofsky for not shying away from showing us some of what it apparently takes to be a professional ballerina although let us not forget the important fact that all films are nothing more than artifice so we must treat the physical deformities shown in Black Swan as such even if they do appear to scream a very brutal truth at our eyes and ears.\n\n\n   Moving on, as far as the characters were concerned, minus Natalie Portman's character Nina, I at first felt that all of them were very cardboard and one dimensional. That is until it was pointed out to me that the entire film is shown from Nina's perspective. That changed things up a bit. You see, Nina is a ballerina chasing after perfection. Dancing is her life. She is so focused on getting every little detail of every move right that she never spends time with other people. Her best friend is her mother. Her perception of her dancing comrades and teachers barely scratches the surface of who most of them are as people outside the studio. So they are more or less portrayed as such in the film. However despite that I also found them to be more or less cliched. Vincent Cassel plays Thomas Leroy, the head of the studio and a womanizing prick that reminded me of the previous characters he portrayed in Oceans 12 and Eastern Promises. He better be careful or he could become type cast for life. Barbara Hershey does her best to play Nina's overbearing and overprotective mother Erica but at times I couldn't help thinking of her performance as just a tame (thats right, tame) version of Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest. Mila Kunis plays Lily, the Black Swan to Nina's white. She is a bold, confident whore of a dancer from the West Coast and it seems Mila Kunis's performance was only effortless because she had effectively played this type of character for so many a year previously on the TV series That 70's Show. As for Winona Ryder, well, I honestly can't say why she was in the film at all, her character felt so lame and pointless. She has fallen a long way from her Edward Scissorhands days and now it seems she has resigned herself to taking a backseat to today's younger talent, ironically a lot like her character in the film.This film however belongs to Natalie Portman and its her show. Her portrayal of Nina I thought was so convincing and so well done that for her not to win Best Actress at the Oscars this year would be sacrilegious. I certainly felt for her and all that she went through in the film and that is a testament to Portmans acting.\n\n\n   As I said earlier Nina is a ballerina who lives alone with her overbearing/ protective mother. She is chosen to portray the coveted dual role of the White and Black Swans in an upcoming production of Swan Lake. However it appears Nina is so uptight, so perfectly innocent that she cannot emotionally free herself enough to also portray the dark, sensuous Black Swan. The pressure to achieve this combined with Nina's paranoia that Lily is trying to steal her role from her drives Nina over the edge and over the course of the film she realistically hallucinates she is painfully transforming more and more into a swan as she tries to free up the darker side of her personality. Repressed sexuality is definitely a major theme of the film and Nina's certainly gets really, really unleashed in a long night sequence I consider the low point of the film where Nina is seduced by Lily into going to a bar and picks up a couple boys and dance and screw them and others while being drugged up. Lily and Nina then proceed to go back to Nina's apartment and have sex in a scene that seemed to me straight out of a gay porno. More than anything  I can say I was offended by the apparent message that in order to live a little you have to essentially become white trash. But from this point on though the film becomes better and better. I personally thought the last third  was nothing short of an absolute tour de force in all areas. The dance sequences were extraordinarily breathtaking and the shot where Nina imagines she has grown feathers all over her body and stands before the audience in her final pose were some of the most beautiful frames of film produced this year.\n\n\n  A few last notes. The images were certainly beautiful, nightmarish, and horrific among others but I was a little put off by the use of hand held cameras. There is no doubt they were used to give the film a documentary feeling but having the frame continuously bob up and down made me feel a little bit queasy at times. I feel like if they had put the camera on a crane it would have smoothed out the motions with some of the dance sequences. The use of mirrors throughout the film to show Nina's dual personality was also great touch but they felt like something straight out of any number of films made by Orson Wells. The ending I felt was predictable since the film very broadly follows the story of Swan Lake itself so it didn't surprise me when it was shown that Nina did not stab Lily with a piece of glass but rather herself instead. Nina finally frees her darker side when she believes she has killed Lily and is able to deliver a stunning performance as the Black Swan. Only after this when she goes back to her dressing room to change back into the White Swan and Lily comes and congratulate Nina does Nina slowly realize what had actually happened. The fact that Nina does not call for help but instead goes through with the last act of the play shows just how tragic a character she really is. She was willing to forgo her own life in an effort to finish her performance and finally achieve perfection.",

As is just about everything in this very-hard-to-categorize movie.  I guess the term \"horror\" would be most fitting for it, but I tend to lean more towards calling it \"an intense, psychological drama\".  It follows the inner-conflicts of the pressure-driven protagonist, through which the audience is taken on a bizarre and unsettling journey as this troubled girl slowly disintegrates into a living nightmare, striving to embrace her darker nature, and thus achieve perfection at the risk of everything else.  It's more disturbing than scary, but through the sheer beauty of its choreographed ballet scenes, the astutely-acted cast, and the commendable work of director, Darren Aronofsky, 'Black Swan' delves deeper than most other films, and as a result, turns out to be a very harrowing, and surprisingly moving tale, about the consequences of giving in to our competitive desires to be better than everyone else.",

As with similar spirals into psychological darkness, the line between facade of the ballet, Portman's personal life, and Portman's hallucinations puts the viewer in the protagonist's shoes to advance the narrative. Tchaikovsky's musical motifs perfectly fit over the film's sequences and paint a stark mood which increases with intensity and velocity of the plot as fragmented as it may be.",
