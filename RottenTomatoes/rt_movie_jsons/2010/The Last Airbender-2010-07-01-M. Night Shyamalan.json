            "content": "I never saw the cartoon so I knew not what to expect, but I was aware of how much the fanbase hated this film.  Dev Patel was great as always.  The story was well done and the special effects are excellent along with the fight scenes.  From what I know, apparently M Night Shymalan took too many liberties with the source material.  You can do that, as long as at its core, the new product remains true to the original.  This one apparently does not.  But I could watch it again and plan to, hopefully.  I enjoyed the heck out of it.  Had it been an original creation I believe the film would have been a hit and spawned multiple sequels or become a cult classic at the very least.  There's a slight chance it could become one if more people who never watched the cartoon catch on and/or the Avatar fanbase becomes more open minded and treats the work like an independent one loosely based on its source material.  I guess in the cartoon there is more to Airbending than shown in the film, but the little you do see is very well done and the story is comparatively engaging as James Cameron's Avatar.  I think in the future this will find more favor with a different audience.\n\n84/100 B",

Glad that this movie & the animation are teaching people about the elements, harnessing your power & that there's more to life than our conditioning would have us believe. Much better than  the usual shallow drivel that dominates & dumbs us down.",

As someone who has watched the animated show multiple times over the years, this movie adaptation is one of the worst ever made. Even without the comparison to the original, this movie is bad in every aspect. The love and respect for the cultures the original nations were based on is completely absent in this film, due to terrible casting and character pronunciation. The effects are mostly terrible and the story and characters are rushed and overly complex, making it a rushed mess. The acting is terrible, and the directing is worse. The only thing I can give credit to this film is the way the characters move when bending the element, but it is immediately ruined by the terrible effects. Overall, The Last Airbender is a complete failure in every aspect and a disgrace to the beloved animated series.",
