    "summary": "Hoping to put to rest years of unease concerning a past case, retired criminal investigator Benjam\u00edn Esp\u00f3sito (Ricardo Dar\u00edn) begins writing a novel based on the decades-old unsolved mystery of a newlywed's rape and murder. With the help of a former colleague, Judge Irene Men\u00e9ndez Hastings (Soledad Villamil), Benjam\u00edn attempts to make sense of the past. The journey through his memories sets Benjam\u00edn on a thrilling emotional path that leads to a shocking realization.",

Told primarily through flashbacks, The Secret in Their Eyes effectively combines police procedural, thriller, and a touch of unrequited love, all leading to an unforgettable and unexpected climax.  Granted, some of the police work and legal proceedings seem like a stretch (the suspect identified through a furtive glance in a picture, hence the title), but these faults can be forgiven in light of the otherwise smart script, strong performances, and stylish direction.  Pass on the shoddy and unnecessary American remake and check out this offering from Argentine director Juan Jose Campanella.",

            "content": "\"The Secret in Their Eyes\" is a good mystery thriller, but personally I wouldn't put it among the very best. The story is engaging enough and the movie kept my interest by featuring two different points in time. I felt there were great performances and one particular sequence that was very well shot. My main issue with the movie was that the big reveals and twists just didn't excite me that much. Maybe I've been spoiled by some of the top-tier dark mystery thrillers of the modern age, I didn't feel as surprised and shocked by some of the moments near the end as much as I think the filmmakers meant to. Overall, this is a very solid movie with a good story but I just wouldn't hail it as one of the all-time greats.",

            "content": "An interesting mystery/crime film import from Argentina. For not a big budget, the producers have managed to pull this off very well, it's a quality movie. And speaking about quality, the very first aspect that I think is important to note, is the acting, it features great acting all around. Guillermo Francella and Pablo Rago are good, but the pair that are Soledad Vilamil and Ricardo Darin as  couple of work partners that have had underlying love between them for long, are just terrific. They really elevate this movie to a status of quality. The cinematography is also good, it's quite polished and the flick is beautiful to look at. \nAnd as for the story, it's a curious mixture of mystery and with a subtle touch or underlying romance as well. And honestly, even though this movie tends to change tones, it's overall pulled off right and doesn't wind up being a mess, but an engaging movie. The 1970s costume design is also a neat aspect which caught my attention. \nBut, I really do dare to say that the movie is overrated, it's a good movie but it isn't phenomenal either, I'm surprised that it won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. \nThere's a very present theme of not being able to let go of the past, as well as unconditional love and justice.  \nAnd speaking of foreign language, I was disappointed to not have been able to find a dubbed version, but only a version with subtitles. Because those subtitles don't catch up with the rapidity of the actors's dialogue, Argentinians being known to speak in a very rapid manner. I think the film could've even been better if we had more time to admire the visual aspects without having to concentrate as much on the late subtitles. \nOverall, this was a very satisfying movie, I enjoyed it. Recommended!!",

            "content": "Juan Jose Campanellella's sprawling drama is set across two time periods, focusing on a retired legal counsellor who we see in the opening scene writing a novel. It quickly becomes apparent that what he is writing is at the very least partly autobiographical; he is writing the novel hoping to find some sort of closure relating to an unsolved homicide twenty five years previously. The case that Esposito is writing about was investigated by himself, his alcoholic partner Pablo, and his law clerk boss, Irene, who he had fallen in love with. The film is set in the present day as Esposito visits Irene and asks her to read his work so far, and large chunks of the film are lengthy flashbacks to the case twenty five years previously. The film works very well as the audience is allowed to unfurl the story at a pace that works superbly, and what could have been a bit of a mess structurally ends up adding real heart to the film. You care about all of the characters and want to see justice done, but this isn't your average time hopping thriller; there are twists and turns around a really melancholic atmosphere. There's no pulsing soundtrack and sudden realisation, the final sequence especially is a beautiful yet harrowing one that takes its time and sums up the film wonderfully. Don't get this mixed up with the pointless American remake, this Argentinian production surprised many by walking away with the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2010.",

The direction and cinematography are great, including the remarkable shooting of a scene in the Racing Football Club stadium.  I highly recommend this movie to fans of dramas, thrillers and suspense movies.  Incase you're wondering what the title has to do with the film, it comes from 2 scenes:  (i)  from Gomez's eyes that were always looking at Coloto in the pictures from their youth; and (ii)  from Esposito's eyes when he walked into Hastings' office, which she clearly assumed (correctly) that Esposito was ready to confess his love for her.

I adored the structure of the movie, how it bounced smoothly back-and-forth between the present and flashbacks. Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil were electric on screen together, and sold you on the unspoken connection better than most films are able to accomplish. This film is a brilliant blend of mystery and romance that impacted me deeper than I ever expected. I will say that the story isn\u2019t a traditional murder mystery, because there aren\u2019t a lot of suspects or clues constantly puzzling the audience. But it still has the same vibe, and I felt the tension of the investigation and their journey to prove who was guilty of the crime. There are a few elements of the movie that I don\u2019t think added to it, like the drunk friend who only does a couple of useful things in the plot, but those missteps were few and far between. Where I found myself most disappointed was in the end of the film. When I first watched it, I was clearly looking for something that this movie wasn\u2019t attempting. There\u2019s more subtlety in the final act of The Secret in Their Eyes than I was anticipating, and so initially I disliked the conclusion. However, now that I\u2019ve had a few days to reflect, I think it is more powerful and effective than I originally noticed. With time my rating might go up even higher.",

            "content": "A thoughtful, unflashy and mature movie about past mistakes and the memories that follow us, The Secret In Their Eyes is a film for those who like a story to carefully and methodically unfold, rather than fire off all at once. Featuring calm and collected performances which aren't afraid to break free now and then, some incredible camerawork, especially an unbroken 5-minute shot at a football stadium, a believable romance, witty dialogue and an overall satisfying plot that wraps up just how it should. It's well deserving of both its praise and its Academy Award. We witness a man, browbeaten by life, work and things he should have said and done long ago, and finds a kind of epic tragedy in his many failings, but doesn't take the easy route and make him a target for easy jokes. Instead we're left to experience what it's like to be him, highs and lows and everything in between. If I could fault it at all I would say that, at times, the pacing feels a little too deliberate, like the movie wants to hold onto us as long as possible. But its intentions are good and its delivery is always earnest. You will enjoy it as you watch it, and think about it long after it's over.",

They drive a plot with shocking surprises. They dispense bits of wisdom unsubtly but without seeming too cliched. The action starts in 1970s Argentina, but it would be a mistake to make too much of political references; if you are looking for a better understanding of that place and time, this is not the place to find it, though the story succeeds on its own terms.",

Therefore, I was expecting the movie to be a little different and even more intriguing, maybe it was the fact that it had won an Academy award. But I did like a lot the love story it featured at the center of all the crime scenery, it was very captivating and the characters had a lot of chemistry. There was in particular one scene that was so electrifying you could feel the tension between them. Moreover, the movie was actually good and although not the best crime story I've seen, it was compelling and it had very strong performances and a great dose of humor that didn't hurt. Although I did expect a little more from it, to be honest.  \n~November 20, 2015~",
