            "content": "\"A Prophet\" is a film that must be seen and enjoyed. An impressive and unique drama from \"Jacques Audiard\", a respected contemporary French director who has gained a high position for himself with this film. The movie \"A Prophet\" is a lasting movie with no expiration date. The sequence of killing \"Rib\" is a masterpiece and unmatched. \"Tahar Rahim's\" performance in the role of \"Malik Al Jabna\" is unique and deserved to receive the best actor Caesar, but the other masterpiece of the film belongs to \"Niels Arstrup\" in the role of \"Cesar Luciani\". A subtle and powerful game that cannot be found in the current cinema. It shows such power, strength and decline that you will be amazed. This film tells the story of the impact of the environment and society on the occurrence of violence and the rise to power of a cowardly youth. French contemporary cinema is respected and praised, and the south of France plays an effective role in French contemporary cinema. The island of Corsica is in the south of France, and the film's reference to \"Corsicans\" refers to the Italians living on that island.",

It is a bleak and powerful film about power structures and the shifting dynamics within the closed society of criminals.  Granted, mid-way through, the plot feels as though it begins to spin out of control and becomes a bit muddled, but maybe that's the point – in a world without rule, there is no way to establish any kind of reasonable structure.  Regardless, the handheld camerawork gives it a gritty, realistic feel, the Alexandre Desplat score creates an excellent atmosphere, and the performance of Arestrup is chilling.",

            "content": "Two popular movie genres--the gangster picture and the prison film--get a welcome retooling with this superior French film. Director Jacques Audiard strips both genres of clichés and romanticism and shows us the harsh and uncompromising reality of this criminal underworld. Take a murder scene early on in the movie: it involves two men in a small room and a razor blade. They struggle in a fight until one has an advantage over the other and slits the man's throat. Audiard makes the scene vivid for its intimacy, immediacy, and the graphic nature of the violence. Slicing open the jugular is not pretty; violence is ugly. It's just a small example of how this talented director doesn't cut corners in his depiction of this harsh lifestyle. Tahar Rahim gives a performance of profound complexity and subtlety. He performs a certain balancing act; he lets us see the gears turning in Malik's head, connecting the dots and using cold calculation to crave out his own career as he works up the ranks in the prison. But there are other moments when Rahim switches on his poker face and lets us contemplate what exactly is going on in Malik's head, which is when he's at his most fascinating. Niels Arestrup plays an aged gang leader who finds himself growing older and less important as he takes Malik under his wing. There's a hint of Frankenstein in his performance, and he gets a moment where he realizes what he has turned Malik into after mentoring him for several years, a moment he plays to absolute perfection. There are several familiar elements from both genres that are here--the prison pecking order, ethnic gangs, the sudden bursts of violence, the drugs and betrayal of a fellow gang member. Yet Audiard handles all of these elements in the story with aplomb. Clocking in at two and a half hours, the film is surprisingly nimble, as Audiard finds a rhythmic tempo to the drama that keeps it gripping and involving. The film's subtext about the violent wing of Islam and it's impact on Europe is nicely underplayed and never inflammatory. This film lost the foreign film Oscar, but it's easy to see why it was this terrific film was nominated",

I simply found that my investment fell off a cliff after that incredible opening half-hour or so. Nothing ever matched the scene with Reyeb and the razor blade. I appreciated the experimental elements littered throughout, but honestly felt let down by the infrequency of their usage. Such was my overall experience with \"A Prophet,\" a movie that has undeniably impressive elements within it, but ultimately didn't align with my tastes as much as I hoped it would.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Das Zentrum von Un Prophete ist ein Mord - ein ungeschickter und unglaublich brutaler Mord. Wir erleben den Killer wie er zittert - ob aus Trauer, Erleichterung oder Wut wissen wir nicht. Genau das ist der Schlüssel zu Jacques Audiards grösstem Film: Wir sehen etwas und können es doch nicht verstehen. Vielleicht liegt das auch daran, dass wir Zeuge von extremer Gewalt werden, die uns fremd ist. Mörder wie der in Un Prophete leben in einer anderen Welt. Der Film funktioniert als Entwicklungsgeschichte von Malik (Tahar Rahim), einem jungen Franzosen mit arabischen Wurzeln. Er kommt ins Gefängnis als Kleinkrimineller und verlässt es als geprüfter Gangster. Geboren wurde er als schüchterner, passiver Verlierer; zunächst ist ihm das wahrhaft Böse noch fremd. Alles, was er wurde, er lernte es im Gefängnis. Ich kann mich kaum erinnern, in einem Gefängnisfilm einen solchen Charakter je erlebt zu haben! Wir wissen nicht, weshalb er eingeliefert wurde, wir sind nur Zeuge, wie er seine Unschuld verliert. Hinter Gittern schliesst er sich der korsischen Gang an, die alles kontrolliert. Angeführt wird sie von Cesar Luciani (Niels Arestrup), einem Paten mit kalten Augen. Im Gefängnis wird er von Bodyguards begleitet und hat seine Spione überall. Der Neue ist nützlich für ihn, da er Zutritt zur arabischen Gang hat. Einer von ihnen soll ermordet werden. Im Grunde ganz simpel: Cesar bringt Malik bei, wie man eine Rasierklinge im Mund versteckt. Mit der soll dem Opfer die Kehle durchgeschnitten werden. Weigert sich Malik, muss er sterben. Töte oder stirb. Malik hat noch nie getötet und verpfuscht den Job. Es gibt einen Kampf und alles ist mit Blut bedeckt. Cesar aber hilft, die Tat zu vertuschen. Malik ist kein \"Mann\", aber ein Überlebender, der das Nötige tut. Und er lernt schnell. Über die Jahre verändert er sich, ergreift die Chance im Knast, die ihm draussen in der Gesellschaft nie vergönnt war. Er lernt wie man überwacht, eine Strategie entwickelt und sogar wie man liest. Für die Korsen aber wird er immer der \"dreckige\" Araber bleiben. Vielleicht ist aber auch genau das der Grund, weshalb er zu Cesars Vertrauten wird. Mallik kann nicht mehr zurück zu den Arabern. Es gibt keinen Platz für ihn, ausser den an Cesars Seite. Diese Partnerschaft mit Cesar verbessert nicht zuletzt Maliks eigene Position im Knast. Fast möchte man diese Stellung als Ende einer Bildungsgeschichte begreifen. Arestrup als Cesar ist das Ereignis von Un Prophete! In allen Filmen von Jacques Audiard gibt es diese denkwürdigen Performances, doch Cesar übertrifft sie alle! Cesar sieht alles, will aber selbst nicht wahrgenommen werden. Deshalb muss er seine Aggression steuern und kontrollieren. So lange er das beherrscht, behält er die Macht über Leben und Tod. Seine grössten Momente, sie sind meist still. Entscheidungen werden getroffen und kalt umgesetzt. Und Malik, der Neue? Ein Enigma. Wir wissen nicht, was er denkt, können es nicht einmal erraten. Vermutlich ist das die Qualität, die Audiard erreichen wollte. Nichts dringt bei ihm nach draussen und Gefühle zu verbergen ist Cesars wichtigste Lektion für Malik. Hier schliesst Audiard an die stilisierten Gangster-Klassiker der 60er an. Das ist im besten Sinne unmodern, denn viel zu viele Filme, wollen uns unbedingt aufdrücken, was die Protagonisten gerade denken und warum. Wieviel faszinierender aber ist es, im Dunkeln zu tappen? Was denkt Malik? Er ist bereit zu töten. Wir können ihn nur durch seine Taten richten. Das aber macht es furchteinflössend, denn ein Killer ohne Motive ist nur umso schrecklicher. Malik war einmal jemand, für den das Leben eine Bedeutung hatte. All das aber ändert sich während seiner blutigen Tat im Gefängnis. Nun ist er bereit für die Strasse draussen...",

With a true girth of talent on camera from Niels Arestrup's crime matriarch Cesar Luciani through to cancer suffering criminal Ryad played by Adel Bencheriff, every actor makes their character memorable. The multi-layered story centers upon young and uneducated criminal Malik El Djebena played by a freakishly good Tahir Rahim. The film charts a truly believable and fascinating rise of Malik a man that we as an audience root for from frame one until the films perfectly fitted conclusion. Malik's time in this particular French prison transcends it's genre however thanks to Audiard's brave and beautiful direction.\n\nWowing audience's the world over last year with his haunting tale Rust and Bone Audiard here in A Prophet showcased an impressive feat to create a movie that at times is chillingly violent (a scene with a razor blade comes to mind here) and starkly beautiful. Audiard's direction is a that of a filmmaker in complete control of his material, not afraid to mix in on paper odd song choices, scenes of the titular prophetic visions and one of the movies strongest and haunting elements that of a ghost of Malik's past that accompanies him on his prison sentence. These elements plus many more unmentioned make A Prophet the experience it is and we as a cinema loving people should be thankful that these pieces came together the way they did for us to sit back and partake in.\n\nA Prophet hit a chord with audiences so much so that it was almost immediately commissioned for an English language remake that just recently was announced to be scripted by Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River author Dennis Lehane. Whatever this remake ends up being one thing is for sure, it has mighty prison boots to fill for this version of the story is about as perfect as you'd ever hope for and a movie that will continue to be found and adored by movie lovers the world over.\n\n5 razor blades out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "The movie starts with a lonely troubled young man named Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) beginning a six year prison sentence. Being subjected to the hard realities of life inside he is soon spotted by a Corsican leader  César Luciani (Niels Arestrup) who black mails the Malik saying that he will die if he doesn't play ball. Malik sees no other option but to cooperate and afterwards he is haunted by what he is forced to do in order to survive, once Malik is under César's protection, he is used pretty much as a servant but constantly is being subjected to racism by his new found protectors whom dislike him. Malik becomes more curious about religion and education, Malik then meets Ryad (Adel Bencherif) who not only tutors him but also befriends him. The friendship between these two is a crucial element to the film as I feel as though this is Malik first sense of family and this helps keep him in balance; I enjoyed watching their friendship grow.\n\nFollowing the release of many of César's fellow gang members, Malik finds himself progressing within César's circle becoming his \"eyes and ears\".  With his new role Malik soon grows in confidence and meets the gypsy who is a hash dealer, they soon become friends and the gypsy shares his ideas and stories from the drug trades. When Malik is told by César to take his leave days in order to run errands for him outside of the prison, Malik is also setting up a drug deals with his friend Ryad. When César hears about these drug deals and that Maik is risking his leave days meaning he can no longer be used outside of the prison César decides to punish Malik (the results of which were emphasized by using very interesting cinematography) but what occurs next was something neither of them was prepared for but with Malik surviving against the odds (which is put down to his new found religion) this time César has gone too far and sparks Malik to take control.\n\nThis movie was my very first foreign film and I just couldn't take my eyes away from it (not just because if I did I'd miss the subtitles).  With a running time of 155 minutes maybe in my opinion they probably could have cut this time down but I wasn't too bothered as it is a good movie and good movies can be as long as they want as long as they keep you entertained.\n\nMagnifique!",

He commits the murder in order to save his own life, since Reyeb is a witness to a Corsican crime, and they order Malik (in white) to kill him. Because he is bombarded with information he has not asked for, he is to take responsibility. As soon as Malik executes the murder, he gives his back to the dead body. Guilt! Root of redemption! Moving on. \nNext picture. \n\n \n\nEmpowerment via education. Audiard specifically films the education of the language and economics. Financial rule is about language games (SUNS)! Moving on. \nSpotlight!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this scene, Reyeb's ghost, symbolized by the fire, who is imagined throughout the film until Malik convinces himself that he has satisfied his guilt by sacrificing his money to Muslims wishes Malik a happy birthday. It has been one year since Malik has entered the prison. Prison is like the 'free world' and is signified by the wishing of a happy birthday, indicating the birth of a soul upon his entrance into the prison. Metaphor for the world outside of the 'prison'! Moving on.  \n\nNext, the spotlight is shone here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the vision, which Malik sees that leads to Lattrache accusing Malik of being a prophet. The scene where he foresees the accident, and therefore prevents death, or extends life, Malik is looked upon as a prophet. This provides that final push required, fulfilling his individualistic oriented mind in the process, and contributes to his power gain. The significance of others' perception regarding Malik's position on the hierarchy is projected here when he is called a prophet, and we observe that this is the changing point in his life. Fantastic stuff! Moving on. \n\nSpotlight shifts here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough not the last frame upon which the spotlight is shone, compare this image with the first image shown. The figure in power, the others carelessness signified by their momentary stares, and the emotionless figure are all opposite to the first frame shown. Surprisingly enough, others do not give half a crap about who the figure in power previously was, and only seem to work for the figure currently in power. Another point illustrated by Audiard is how all the figure in power sometimes needs, is a permanently mental whack caused by the defiance of the subjects towards the rule or confinement. \nLast but not least, a further confirmation of a previously mentioned point. Spotlight is finally about to turn off. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudiard purposefully filmed this scene in a manner in which Malik, his godson and his godson's mother are not aware of the surveillance behind them. Audiard's placement of this scene as the final one was to commemorate the confinement's similarity in both the 'prison' and the outside world. Once again, confinement in prison and the outside world! Moving on. \n\nTurn off the spotlight. Time to look at it in a wholly view. One of the first scenes in the film shows how Malik is stripped naked; he is stripped off his identity and is given one to adapt to in the confined world, just the audience is everyday when they are bombarded with subliminal messages on a secondly basis. We then observe Malik's rise to power after he is under the protection of the corrupt system, which is as a result of committing a deadly sin. Through this protection and the realization of Malik being Caesar's only source of enforcing his power, Malik sets on the route which he believes will lead to his own empowerment; education. \nMalik studies language and economics, or what Audiard believes is key to empowerment. This is similar to Jean-François Lyotard's idea, a French philosopher from the 20th century, which suggests that a single variation in the 'normal' utterance in language can change the game. Malik strives to perfect his language in order to be able to enable his ability to change the game that is being played, and to gain power, which is sadly and truthfully represented by economy in the film. Following Malik's initial lessons, the ghost of his murder's victim visits him and wishes him a happy birthday after spending a year in the prison. \nThis serves the main point of the film, which is that the world inside the prison is no different from the outside world. The birthday song is meant to signify that when he entered the prison and was stripped off his identity just like we are when we are born into the real world. From the day we are born, Audiard suggests that we are being molded into what the confiner has in mind for us, as those confined. We are the victims of a world in which the prison is no different from the outside world, and we must not resist this power or else we get beat up for it, as shown in the first image. The vision follows to provide the empowering push required for Malik to gain power. He is titled a prophet after being able to predict an accident. \nAlthough a highly intellectual individual, Malik realizes that he is nothing without the perception of others of him as the figure in power. As soon as he notices that he is looked upon as a prophet, or a supreme human being, Malik grabs the opportunity to become the person he dreams of being; the figure in power. Audiard completely rejects Descartes' perception of existence, which is heavily subjective, and is clearly shown to be for Berkeley's, which states that to be is to be perceived. \nFollowing the departure of his workers, Caesar's power is threatened, as his only worker is Malik. A further illustration of Berkeley's point lies here when Malik no longer looks upon him as the figure in power, and he is therefore constricted from all the power that he previously embodied. Audiard also suggests that if the figure upon which you depend on for power betrays you and instead strives for their power gain, you lose all your power. In other words, the confiner is nothing without those being confined. \nAlso related to confinement is the main point of the Audiard's film. In the final shot, after Malik is freed from prison, he followed by three cars, which is unaware of, which serve to illustrate the similarities of confinements in both the prison and the outside world. Heavily related with surveillance and confinement is Michel Foucalt's Panopticon, which states that the main source of the subjects feeling confinement is as a result of surveillance. Audiard suggests that there will always be a confiner and a confined, and figure in power that who isn't respectively, and signifies that the root to empowerment is through Jean-François Lyotard's language games.",

I make the Scorsese joke because films like Goodfellas and Casino achieve an impossible ethical feat: they make being a mobster seem cool; they make us say, \"Gee, if I were a mobster, I'd be that cool, dressing in sherbet-colored suits.\"  And A Prophet wants us to make the same type of ethical leap: they want us to sympathize with a character who goes through a profound ethical transformation from doe-eyed innocent to cold-blooded killer.  But unlike the charming Ace Rothstein, Malik doesn't inspire, intrigue, or charm.\nThe film's portrayal of Muslim fundamentalism doesn't get a lot of traction and its aim isn't that clear to me.\nOverall, Scorsese has done better - wait, are you sure he didn't direct this?",

If you do, you will be missing on some of the best in the world cinematography on this subject.  It stars Tahar Rahim in the title role as an imprisoned petty criminal of Algerian origins who rises in the inmate hierarchy, as he initiates himself into the Corsican and then Muslim subcultures. It is a work of fiction, and for the director the film aimed \"creating icons, images for people who don't have images in movies, like the Arabs in France.\"  The character of Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim), nineteen years old, French of Algerian descent was so realistically portrayed that it is really hard to understand it as a fictional character, as well as the character of the Corsican mobster Cesar Luciani (Niels Arestrup).  The director wanted to ensure the authenticity of the prison experience, and hired former convicts as advisors and extras... \r\n\r\nThe screenplay was done exceptionally seamless and I wasn't even aware when the transitions unfolded most of the times. The main character had nothing when started and the indifference toward him slowly built up a change that he became someone we cared and wanted to succeed. Of course such screenplay and outstanding director could not be unnoticed: A Prophet won the Grand Prix at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, at the 53rd London Film Festival, it won the Best Film Award. After that won the Prix Louis Delluc 2009, nd at the 63rd British Academy Film Awards, it won a BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language. It was nominated for 13 César Awards, tying it with three other films for the most nominations of any film in César history. It won 9 Cesars at the ceremony, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. The film was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. The film also won Best Foreign Film at the 13th annual British Independent Film Awards, which were held in London at the Old Billingsgate on December 5, 2010... still thinking of missing this? \r\n\r\nDon't!",

It's amazing to watch how a criminal rises to power, from being an innocent peddler into becoming a corrupt soul. That's what we love about The God Father. And in the same way, A Prophet delivers the same thing. Though there's less words and more on-screen storytelling. That's what I really like about European films.",

            "content": "A gritty depiction of prison life which shows the rise of a young Algerian in a French prison and yep if the metaphor didn't hit you over the head you ain't watching properly! However, the film gives you such deatail and such an engaging story that you buy it hook, line and sinker. Like a young Micheal Corleone, Rahim as El Djebana slowly rises through the circles of organised crime by playing each faction off against itself. \nThe performances across the board are outstanding but Rahim and Arestrup as Cesar would garner Oscar nominations if it was an English speaking film. \nThough the film is long at 2 and a half hours, it does not flag at all: the pacing is well structured and at each juncture the story delivers a payoff.",
