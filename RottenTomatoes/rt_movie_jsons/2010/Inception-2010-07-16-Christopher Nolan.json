The idea, creative imagery, special effects which are 90% practical, elaborate sets, and characters are riveting to watch come together. This is something that the less you know going in, the better. Everyone should see this once. Masterfully edited as well.",

In the case of Inception, the premise is interesting, the cast is impressive (Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elliot Page, etc.), and the special effects are periodically spectacular.  However, as with a handful of his other movies, the story becomes convoluted beyond belief (it's a dream\u2026within a dream\u2026within a dream!!), resulting in the characters providing expository dialogue to explain the madness to the dumbfounded audience, giving the whole thing a condescending vibe.  There is a kernel of a great idea here, but Nolan insists on ruining it by showing off his towering intellect.  Thanks for nothing.",

All Nolan's skills are technical, the less said about the lack of subtlety in his scripts and screenplays the better. The music is so loud and amped up that one cannot even fall asleep in the popcorn. To suggest that the innermost level of dream boils down to a scene from Ice Station Zebra or another Alistair Maclean speaks to an incredible lack of imagination and genuine original creativity.  And there is no wit, no humour, no sense of fun, it has all been bleached out. As your most famous creation asked, 'Why So Serious?' Yawwwwn.",

There are some inconsistencies, but overall, very entertaining. The whole premise behind the film is excellent but there is a lot of ambiguity. I would like to have seen more sophisticated storytelling in each layer. The snow scene just appears to have been action for the sake of itself, even though the outcome was vital to the plot. However, the final outcome of the dream sequence is never explained outside of a dream, so we never get to understand if it all paid off. We could go even further and say that we cannot even be sure that the whole thing from beginning to end was just a dream.",

But while it's really good this film isn't perfect their are some flaws but the flaws can be overlooked like for example their is a lot of exposition in the film but it's necessary since it their to explain the concept of the movie since it involves Dreams which is a weird concept that any normal person would be asking questions about like how do they work?, can this happen?, what happens if I do this?, etc. \n\nThe film is super entertaining their is not a time you will feel bored or feeling like your time is being wasted like the dreams they never get through what's the point of it existing but instead it always begins right in the middle of it. Like in the beginning of the movie we don't have scene of Cobb & Arthur arriving at the party, talk with the other guests, planning a meeting with Saito which finally establishes why we are here. It skips all that & instead has us learning that Saito is in a dream & that he has a secret that's worth stealing right away before we learn all the other info first since we don't start off in the beginning of the dream we start off in the middle of it which has us constantly wondering what happened before this? how did they get into this situation? whenever they enter a dream which gives it one of the most thrilling movie openings of all time & leave anyone watching with excitement on what's going to happen for the rest of the movie.\n\nIn the first dream our characters kidnap Fisher which has them having to deal with his security, in the second dream they are already trying to get Fisher to join the team all while the environment of the dream is being moved around with due to gravity of the car chase, In the third dream we are scouting out a military base which has Fishers secret the team has been looking for. Notice how their is no filler here it's all just what we want to see it's made to make sure we don't get bored. But this does sorta make Fisher seem like a boring character that is just a tool for the characters goals but that's where your wrong since they have Earmes infiltrate his legal team but they skip all the boring interview steps & instead put us right in the moment we want to see he we see the relationship Fisher & his father have right away these scenes are also connected with a clear reason & motivation for us being here so it doesn't feel random or out of nowhere. \n\nThe concept of Dreams in this film is also very interesting they aren't bound by any rules or realism through out the film characters are hopping between dreams all the time that differ from one another one minute we could be in a Train than a Plane, Asia, Europe, etc & the weather changes to it could be sunny, rain or snow their is no limitations on what can happen or where which makes the visuals not feel repetitive or all the same every dream is different than the last.",

            "content": "Writer/director Christopher Nolan is one of the most daring filmmakers out there today. He loves to craft intricate narratives ripe with symbolism and thematic layers that you can peel back upon repeated viewings. He is a dreamer with a lot on his mind, more than most other filmmakers. The guy who toyed with chronology and narrative structure in 'Memento', who redefined the possibilities of the comic-book/superhero movie with his cerebral 'Batman' films, has staked his place among the best directors of our time, an artist who creates vivid dreamscapes on silver screens for audiences to take in. With this trippy sci-fi mind-bender, the movie event of the summer and the best film of 2010 so far, he has created perhaps his most elaborate dream yet. This strikingly original, intelligently dense, and wholly absorbing film is an enigma wrapped in a puzzle trapped in a maze. From the first moments to the final \"twist\" (one that has sparked much debate and analysis) the film pulls you in and casts a dazzling spell. Nolan fills the frame with astonishing visuals--Paris folding in on itself, a city of skyscrapers that crumble into the sea. A gravity-defying fight sequence in a corridor is a serious jaw-dropper. Leonardo DiCaprio is a sturdy, compelling presence that guides us through this dizzying maze. Solid support is provided by the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Marion Cotillard and Cillian Murphy. As far as popcorn actioners go, this is VERY smart and challenging. Blink, and you'll miss something. But this rewards close attention, and will undoubtedly unravel glorious symbolic riches upon multiple viewings. Like the very idea of \"inception\" at its core, this film will get inside your head, fester and churn, and stay with you LONG after the end titles disappear. A brilliant masterpiece",

I have seen it 10 times (literally) and have still not gotten sick of it. Christopher Nolan can be described as nothing other than brilliant- absolutely, purely, enchantingly brilliant. His cinematography is always top-notch, but his plots are to die for. There is always something so alluring about his films. INCEPTION is a beautifully complex action-thriller about the art of transporting your consciousness into someone else's mind. You go into their dreams- their secrets are yours to discover- but it all comes at a cost, of course. This movie has some action scenes, some curse words- pretty acute swearing, and will lead you to question a lot of things. Nolan always has an all-star cast that never disappoints, and loves to use Hans Zimmer to do his soundtracks. Hans Zimmer is the perfect composer for Nolan movies- their individual arts of music and cinema combine, leading to a perfect, jaw-dropping movie. This movie will make you feel amazing; invincible. I must warn you, though, this is one of those movies that you have to really think about (Nolan's beautiful brain strikes again). \"What is the most resilient parasite? Bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm? An idea. Resilient, highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate.\" - Dom Cobb, Inception.",

Also a bit weird that Saito is just able to wipe any charges from Cobb\u2019s record or find him in Mombasa just before he gets caught by the people chasing him (though this may or may not be a dream sequence but even then, whose mind are they in at the moment?) I may have misremembered some of this as I haven\u2019t seen the movie in a few months but I\u2019ve seen it 3 or 4 times; like I said it\u2019s one of my favorites but it admittedly has some flaws that some may be put off by. Tldr great movie with occasional plot armor to keep the story going, \u201cobjectively\u201d speaking it\u2019s a 9/10 for me but it\u2019s the kind of movie I really like and am probably going to enjoy a bit more than most people no matter what.",

The plot is so unique and awesome with this unexpected twist turn you never could have seen it coming. It feels so realistic, like it could really happen, because Nolan has done such a good job on creating Inception. The action is quite lame for a PG-13 movie, if I'm to be honest, but the whole big plot is so interesting why bother needing some action. I would have been just fine if there wasn't any action.\nIt is such a breathtaking movie, and the breathtaking moments start from the very beginning. It is a bit confusing to follow, but they do go along and explain what is happening and what \"Inception\" is. The big twist when we learn that Cobb had already used Inception on his wife is shocking! I don't know about your opinions, but I believe Cobb is accountable for his wife's death -- even though he didn't physically kill her, he planted a dangerous idea to \"keep her safe\" which backfired to her committing suicide. The whole movie is breathtaking and superbly made. It is one of the most unique/original sci-fi films out there!",

All the while, Hobb must battle the secrets that lie beneath his own subconscious.\n\nHonestly, I was expecting much more from this film. But it took me around 10 tries to sit through its entirety. Not only is Inception's runtime bulky, we aren't introduced to all of our key characters until around the 50-minute mark and it takes 90 minutes for the epic plan to take motion.\n\nYou kind of have to watch it with company in order to stay hooked. Your viewing buddy will have to keep you focused, because it is far too easy to get drowned in what feels like a clunky, massive information dump (in the first act). The excess exposition bogs down the pace of the story, which is so difficult to follow with all of the dreams inside of dreams inside of dreams\u2026 \n\nThe talented cast gave sterling performances, with Gordon-Levitt being my personal favorite. The best thing about Inception's editing and cinematography is that a great deal of the visual effects were shot practically and were admittedly stunning. And while the third act is a bit drawn out, it is undeniably the best part of the film. The intercut action sequences feel a bit more cohesive. It was great to see the team in action rather than the team in talking.\n\nTo say the least, Inception is WAY overhyped, has an acquired taste, and did not exceed my expectations. In true Christopher Nolan fashion, this movie comes with an avalanche of too much exposition to stick to your brain that comes hurling at you at a snail's speed. But when it hits you, and destroys everything in sight, it's something to see\u2026 I guess. 68%.",

The directing talent from Christopher Nolan is truly remarkable and the special effects/CGI is great. The action scenes especially in the middle of the film were my favorite parts, plus the ending scene. Not to mention the cast of actors that they were able to have participate in the production, very noteworthy.\n\nThe film does have some issues though that may alienate some viewers. Much of the phenomenon in the movie is left up to a lot of interpretation and can make your mind too blown while you're still trying to keep up with the plot. It can be a lot to take in all at once and confuse people who aren't used to a movie like this. Plus I think that the romance between Cobb and Mal bogged down the main mission of the team a little too much, but I still see why something like that was included.\n\nOverall a pretty good movie! There is a lot to say about this movie and many ways to analyze it and that's why it was popular I guess!",

He knows how to deliberately lose the audience's comprehension to then retrieve it with magnificence. What truly makes Nolan's famous fiction movie Inception a masterpiece of time and reality mayhem, is the way the story is written and developed. It starts with a pretty strenuous concept: the inception of dreams. But then, as the story unwraps, with well-pace actions, embracing dialogues and great characters dissections, we begin to fathom what this concept of infiltrating dreams can serve for, alongside how it actually works \u2013 using great insight of true physics and thorough studies upon the very subject of dreams and time. All leading to an ending that wraps into this \"open ways\" notion. \nThe casting is straight up perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio embraced the role of Dom Cobb as a professional, really diving into the trauma of the protagonist and exploiting the pain and adventurous errands that this character went through in his past. Tom Hardy nailed the role of the Eames, a character capable of impersonating others within one's dream, using his seriousness and his passionate sheer acting. Cillian Murphy, managed to play the role of a broken son left with the legacy of his dead father like a boss, using his prowess acting and his bewitching voice. And last, but not least, Eliott Page, who really knows how to do her job and create an emotional and interesting character, Ariadne, ready to help her team as the ingenious architect of dreams. \nI could spend a day writing about the story and how the cast, the full cast, is perfectly chosen, but I think the points I've given are enough to catch your attention \u2013 without spoiling the whole narrative \u2013 if you haven't seen the movie yet.",

This doesn't ruin the pace of the movie but it feels like a little disconnect. Because every other character in the movie knows exactly what's going on except when they haven't been informed about the job (which then is very obvious they would have questions).\n\nNothing of this ruin the movie but bring it down from the \"Masterpiece\" title.\n\nThe meaning and understanding of the movie are though very hard to get. The whole movie has two very straight forward and simple goals : Plant the idea of splitting up Robert Fishers' father's empire which will then give Cobb safety to go home to his kids. But there is a lot more to understand about the movie (which I will not go in-depth to in this review).\n\nThe choreography is amazing. It's seem less to watch the fight-scenes.

It questions the very reality we live in and where we go when we dream.

            "content": "I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to \"The Dark Knight\", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.\n\nNot since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film \"Paprika\" in the whole \"invading dreams\" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.\n\nVisuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (\"G.I. Joe\", \"Transformers\") or the exact opposite (\"Doubt\", \"Invictus\"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.\n\nAlthough having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where \"Inception\" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.\n\nOnce the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (\"Avatar\" be damned).\n\nOf course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort \"Shutter Island\". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.\n\nNolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (\"The Dark Knight\"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.\n\nChristopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And \"Inception\" can proudly stand alongside \"Blade Runner\" and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.\n\nThere are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.\n\nMissing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.",

If Memento introduced the world to Christopher Nolan, and The Dark Knight elevated his career to becoming one of the biggest directors, then Inception catapulted Nolan into a league of his own. Inception has become everyones favourite \"confusing\" film (to be honest, the movie is pretty straightforward if you pay your full attention towards it). The film, which was being promoted as an action thriller, was so much more than that. There was the iconic action sequences of course, but there also was an amazing emotional quotient to the film. The film is also pretty interesting to think about, because technically Leonardo DiCaprio's Don Cobb could be considered the bad guy as he alters the thought process of Cillian Murphy's businessman character in order to allow Ken Watanabe to succeed in his ventures. Also, the movie doesn't have a direct antagonist if you think about it. Watanabe and Marion Cotillard are presented as possible villains, but they're not necessarily evil incarnate. Both have specific motives which are not specifically evil. Cotillard's character in particular is very layered, and we see that even though we as the viewer might see her as a villain, she has Cobb as a reason why she acts and thinks the way she does. But what Nolan made possible with Inception was one thing in particular, \"smart blockbuster.\" He helped prove to studios that creating a huge movie with incredible depth could be financially and critically successful. Not only have directors and studios over the years referenced or tried to make the next Inception type film, but we've also seen these big films try to make spectacle work in throwback ways. Like the majority of his films, most of the big stuff was done on set and in camera, allowing the viewer to really sense how real the production values are. But the biggest success of this movie is probably the fact it is still being talked about to this day. Some movies are forgotten within months, but Inception has been a talking point for cinema goers for years now. And the answer to the final scene: Cobb is in reality. Not only is not wearing his ring, but the top never wobbles in the dream.",

And so I decided to check this movie out. And now I have literally no idea what he was smoking. This movie is a masterpiece even by Hollywood standards. It will continue to be known as an iconic movie for generations to come.\n\nThe story is based on Cobb, a thief who uses people's dreams to to learn about their secrets and then uses them to steal from them. Because of the movie's title I thought that the entire movie is taking place in a dream and when they are actually shown to go in a dream it is supposed to be an inception. It was only after I read about it on Wikipedia that I understood that the main movie is taking place outside of dreams.\n\nChristopher Nolan did the absolute right thing by using practical effects instead of CGI. And it was also a pretty genius move to show your dreams that can actually happen in reality. Although many of the dreams shown in the movie look more like James bond films instead of actual dreams, I wouldn't just on that perspective since this is a subjective idea. Most probably many people have such kinds of dreams and they were the ones who were kept in mind when writing the story. But overall this was a great idea since the whole idea is that Cobb steals from the dreams of people and they would not realise that it is a dream only if it is made to be shown as realistic as possible.\n\nThe characters have also been explored very well. Cobb's wife used to be his partner in crime, but after a while she got so much addicted to the inception machine that she started thinking that the real life is also a dream and thus she committed suicide thinking that she will be able to meet cob in his real life. Cobb has been holding himself responsible for his wife's death and does wants a chance to correct his mistake. He has recruited a college student learning architecture and that provides a good way to give exposition without making it look either forced or confusing.\n\nThe only problem I had with this movie was the amount of talking that happens. In every scene there is talking, talking and even more talking, whether it is the the real world scenes or the dreamscapes. It was really boring to see them talk in a movie that is supposed to be about going into other people's dreams and stealing their knowledge and memories. The amount of exposition also seemed unnecessary and it felt like it was only meant to explain the people who are very slow to understand. But other than that I didn't have any problem.\n\nOverall I would say that Inception is one of those movies which define the decade as well as the the potential of Christopher Nolan's storytelling. This movie is a perfect blend of looking legendary and having mostly used practical effects. I considered to be the best Christopher Nolan movie after The Dark Knight.",

Talks about Dominic Cobb is a professional who takes care of extracting secrets from people's minds while they sleep, infiltrating their dreams through a special device that allows a group to participate in a \"shared dream\".  Cobb and his team normally use tricks and deceptions to steal information from the victim, who he believes to be in reality and suspects nothing.  Together with his partner Arthur tries to enter the mind of Mr. Saito, a powerful Japanese businessman, to perform an extraction, but fails when the dream projection of Mal, dead wife of Cobb, appears in the dream interfering with the  operation.\nI advise you to look at it very carefully, otherwise, you will not understand the ending well.\nI think it is one of the best films of 2013, because it differs from the others, it is not monotonous in the plot and you can see that the director has perfected every detail in order to make it fascinating and moving.

The issue I had was that he went out of his way to introduce elements to make the team's path to success more difficult but did so in an unfortunate way, having his main character thoughtlessly insist on imperiling the mission when plenty of alternatives existed for relaying to Eames the shortcut and explaining away the added danger of sedation by basically making it a magical sedative that only leaves you in mortal danger within the dream but will still let you wake up if kicked.

A lot of attention to this movie has been due to the incredible special effects, cinematography and the superb score by Hans Zimmer, but as with any great film it's the story that matters.  As with so many of Nolan's screenplays there is an element of intricate plot details that requires absolute attention in order to really comprehend the full meaning of the ending.  But it rewards the serious observer with a brilliant if enigmatic conclusion that won't be forgotten.  A truly wonderful film for those dedicated enought to pay attention.",

The special effects have aged wonderfully and the cinematography is impressive and intentional - each level of the final dream sequence has its own color scheme and uniquities which helped to keep the story clear and concise.\n\nOn my first viewing, I felt like this movie was far more clever than I was, constantly twisting and turning and keeping some secrets stashed for just the right moment. However, on a subsequent viewing, I realized the plot isn't quite as neat as I originally thought - there are a few points that are never really addressed, along with some plot holes and general glossings-over. Inception does a good job at keeping the disbelief suspended with its engaging performances and impressive set pieces, but it ultimately could have been a little better within even just a hand-waving explanation of some of the more obvious contradictions.",

            "content": "Inception is a movie from 2010 about a father, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, trying to get home to his kids. To do that he needs to do one last very risky job where he will enter someone's unconscious mind while they're asleep and try to plant an idea in their mind. The problem he has with that is that by entering there he also goes down into his own unconsciousness and it'll bring his dead wife into his mission accidentally, who will become a problem for everyone involved. It finishes with him finally getting home but right before the end there's a huge hint pointing out that he may still be asleep and being home is just another level to his unconscious desires which would mean he never really got home nor is he living his real life anymore.\n\nI wholeheartedly love this movie. The ideas of exploring one's unconscious and the way of distorting time the director plays with throughout the movie are just amazing to me. There's a lot of explanation as to how dreams work and the roles your mind plays in each level of your dreams, and the director put so much in blurring the lines between reality and dreams so artistically that it inevitably feels like watching a moving masterpiece. There is a scene in which DiCaprio is talking to someone in a bar and the building he is in starts to shake because the characters are in a car chase in the previous level of unconsciousness. It is obviously a science fiction movie, but it is explained in such a perfect way that it is as believable as it is nerve wrecking and intriguing. At the beginning you can see how different people work and get trained for the job, learning to manipulate one's mind. I think just the concept of the movie is so interesting, I'd watch it all the time, however there's more than just that. The music and sound effects are just as good and accompany the vibe of the movie incredibly. Every single detail was clearly thoroughly thought about and adds to the realism of the movie in the most astonishing way. \n\nIn my opinion, the only thing that is missing from this movie is character \"personality\", the characters are not really individually introduced and most of them don't have any kind of development through the movie but I think, if anything, that allows the viewers to concentrate more on what they do rather than who they are or why they act a certain way. The director probably put less attention on the characters to put the emphasis on the visuals of the movie, which only makes it even more captivating. Essentially, I don't think there's anything in this movie, present or missing, that wasn't done on purpose.\n\nIn conclusion, the movie Inception by Christopher Nolan can be simply described as a masterpiece and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I believe every part of it was deliberately and meticulously calculated. It is so well structured that it keeps you hanging on the edge of your seat the whole time while deeply going into detail about what is happening. The movie has no plot holes, in my opinion, and it just still leaves your head spinning for answers and processing everything you just watched with an amazing suspense type of ending.",

The story is incredibly intriguing and creative with so much worldbuilding and the movie explains the rules of this world very well in a way that doesn't talk to its audience. The audience needs to actually pay attention to what's going on and I love that. It actually makes you think and the story leads to an incredibly exciting last 75 minutes as you genuinely feel scared for the characters, not just because they almost lose but the first hour sets up how important the mission super well but at its core, it's a character-driven story about a man wanting to see his children again and getting over the loss of his wife and seeing Cobb open up to Ariadne about what has happened and her helping him get over it is quite emotional. And how can I forget Hans Zimmer's incredible score? One of the best movies ever made and a must-watch.",

His selection of actors all come from different backgrounds and filmography so it\u2019s great to see all these people in the same project. This movie uses special effects to bend time and space and it\u2019s visually incredible. This movie is the hit that it is because of its appreciation to be different and bring a new story to the eyes and ears.

Instead, the dream landscapes are there to accommodate a handful of action movie setpieces. They are visually stunning setpieces to be sure. In particular, the gravity defying fight scene in a hotel corridor, in which people's bodies are pulled toward constantly shifting centers of gravity, to match a parallel tumble off a bridge in which the bodies of the sleeping dreamers within the dream are plummeting through space in a van. It is a remarkable achievement. However, it is not the stuff of dreams. Dreams are eery and psychologically unsettling. They express buried fears and longings while hinting at the existence of awe-inspiring supernatural forces. And quite often, the locations are spare and minimal. Great filmmakers like Federico Fellini and David Lynch filmed dream sequences that left viewers with gooseflesh, and they did so by fiddling with combinations of settings and sounds usually in spare surroundings. They did so by tugging at the viewer's empathic sense of kinship with the character, and sparking a commingled sense of attraction and dread to the dream narrative. Films can only achieve this effect of heightened emotion and involvement when there is something at stake, something that the viewer cares about. Regrettably, I didn't care about anybody or any outcome in Inception. Will one multinational corporation surpass the other in wealth? Who cares? Will the morally shady Dominic be reunited with his kids? I don't care that much because he's an emotionally closed character. Will Christopher Nolan tie up all the loose ends in his high tech mental thriller? I suppose he did but, again, I didn't care.\n     Inception reminds me of another film in which the main character yearns to return home, The Wizard of Oz. But unlike that film, it is all brains and no heart. Nolan needs to find the courage to admit he is wanting as a complete filmmaker and change his game to reflect the maxim that I learned when I entered teacher's college: \"No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care.\"",

I originally watched 'Inception' when it first came out, which was 10 years ago, and holy sh*t was it better than I remember. This is a masterclass of filmmaking. This is what going to the movies is all about. Action, drama, mystery - this movie had it all - sci-fi, thrills, romance. A unique story, a visual spectacle, and surprisingly more emotional than I remember it being. The cast was perfect, the story was captivating, and none of this would have been made possible without writer/director/producer, Christopher Nolan. I honestly had a hard time thinking of things that I didn't like about this movie. Maybe it can be slightly overwhelming or confusing, but all it really needs is some extra brain power, then you should be fine. I have my nitpicks in my full review, but none of them were major enough to detract from my overall enjoyment. If you haven't already, I highly, highly recommend that you give this a watch. I mean, it's been 10 frickin' years! Get on it!\n\nScore: 9 out of 10\nOverall: Amazing\n\nRecommended for: Everyone, fans of movies, or fans of having really weird dreams for the next couple days.",

The movie's got a brilliant story and it's about this lad called Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who steals important information from his targets, the way he does it is by entering their dreams and getting the main information he's after.\n\nHowever, a lad who's called Saito (Ken Watanabe) offers to get rid of Cobb's complete criminal history record as a payment for performing an inception on his sick contender's son.\n\nThe movie's got some brilliant performance's from each character throughout this movie, especially from Leonardo DiCaprio. I thought he gave one of his greatest performances throughout this movie, he shows his emotions really well and he plays the role of the main character so good.\n\nThe dialogue which is given from each character throughout this movie is very strong, while non of the dialogue which is given or received feels weak in any sort of way.\n\nAlso, the humour which is scattered throughout this movie works really well and it always hits and it never misses in making me laugh in some sort of way.\n\nThe pacing throughout this movie is all honestly great, all of the build ups to certain scenes which end up happening throughout this movie are all built up very well.\n\nThe movie's even got some very beautiful visual effects, which actually hold up very well due to this movie coming out in 2010 and they don't look very dated at all, which I think is another positive for this movie.\n\nFinally, the movie's cinematography which was done by Wally Pfister is honestly so beautiful, he did such a great job on capturing the moments so well and making them look so great. I'm so happy that he got quite a few awards for the best cinematography in 2010, he honestly deserves them he did such a great job.\n\nThe action sequences which end up happening throughout this movie, either it being in the real world or the dream world are all very well done and they're also very cleverly done, which I thought was really good.\n\nThe score which was composed by Hans Zimmer is honestly really well done and I think he did such a great job on composing the full soundtrack for this movie.\n\nOverall, Inception is a brilliant movie and it's honestly a masterpiece and a half. The movie's got a brilliant story, brilliant performances, strong dialogue, great humour, great pacing, beautiful visual effects, beautiful cinematography, very clever action sequences and a great score which was composed by the man, the myth and the legend Hans Zimmer.\n\nThis movie is honestly worth the watch, I'd recommend everyone to watch this, you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit.",

The layers of this movie make it what it is. Some could say this is all about family and what family can do to the mind. Others can say that this is just a big analogy of movie production. What tops all is how this movie can pick apart a mind in such a casual manner. A beautiful used this idea as the main idea for the movie, whereas Nolan uses this idea and combines it with action, romance, and grief. Nolan is at his best with his direction. The movie is shot beautifully and he's never been better in the action department because in his Dark Knight Trilogy the action is shot very poorly. In this, he uses firearms instead of hand to hand and he doesn't use a ton of cuts. Also, the scene where the ground shifts is so well shot. His camera tricks in that scene are so smart and unique. Not only that the movie is written to perfection, but it's also very well thawed out and clearly looks like it went through at least a hundred drafts. The performances are also spectacular. Dicaprio is amazing and Tom Hardy adds some very well placed charisma. Lastly, Ellen Page was more than up for the job as the opposite lead to Dicaprio and she is the perfect way to gently put in the much-needed exposition. Without Page's character, the movie would be a mess. I give Inception a 100%.",

This isn't the first time I've watched Inception, but every time I do, I bring a top out and spin it just to be sure I'm not dreaming. Upon, I think my fourth watch, it's safe to say that I understand so much more of this movie than I did my first watch. Having a movie that requires multiple watches is always good, honestly, I'm not sure how I missed certain moments of this. But, making a mystery this good is already a huge bonus here. I'm going to sound like a broken record player when I say this, but Christopher Nolan is changing Blockbusters almost as much as Steven Spielberg back in the days of Jaws. Rather than focusing on a previously established franchise (excluding the Dark Knight Trilogy), he finds an original idea and makes an amazing film out of it. These films don't only have the fast paced moments to keep casual viewers entertained, but also some quieter moments making the story and characters feel rich, making the world feel that it is lived in. With Inception, Nolan takes the concept of going inside dreams and makes it into a heist movie. That wouldn't work if it weren't for some of the amazing settings of this movie, some of which were filmed on location. While I would never have a dream as down to earth as any of the dreams in Inception, I'm glad Christopher Nolan made the choice to use settings that are quite normal, this way there is always that small voice in the back of your head questioning whether the characters are dreaming or not. There is plenty of symbolism in this movie to richen the mystery as well. The character of Cobb's father is seemingly a large clue pointing to what's real. Even some of the action feels well paced. Note that I say some. As, unfortunately, most of the action in this movie ends up in the final act, which is common, but the way that any threat to the characters is immediately diffused doesn't really work for me. While the reveals at the end put everything into place in one's head, all the emotional moments at the end are crammed in next to action scenes, many of which I couldn't tell what was happening. Inception is a brilliant film. In typical Nolan style, he makes a big budget blockbuster that has A-list stars, but doesn't get too caught up in what the studio wants so it can make money, he made the Dark Knight trilogy, he's going to make money. Christopher Nolan knows how to make his movies meaningful to everyone, and seeing this just makes me more excited for Tenet.",

However, there are two main issues: The inconsistencies (such as regarding the effect of the kicks or the exact situation in limbo) and the fact that a lot of backstory has to constantly be explained. The latter was clearly tried to be made nicer by introducing the character Ariadne and as a newcomer having her learn everything. This is generally a good idea but all of the background surrounding Cobb combined with the specifics of dreams just mean that we are constantly being told information instead of seeing it happen. However, despite this, it is a solid story with a good plot twist / open ending, a great cast and an amazing score. Plus, it has a huge amount of rewatching potential.",

Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Marion Cotillard and (albeit minor) Michael Caine. Tremendous performances from all of them.\n\nDiCaprio is always a great watch, he kills it in this production - the perfect person to play Cobb. Gordon-Levitt and Page are excellent here, despite being the two I'd (wrongly) assume would be the weaker performers. Hardy and Murphy are the opposite, I expected top level and they certainly gave it.\n\nEverything about this is astoundingly good. Christopher Nolan & Co. get it so, so right. The film is such a smooth ride in terms of following the premise, in spite of the roller coaster ride you experience seeing it play out. The ending is fantastic too, many films on this scale mess up the conclusion but they don't.\n\nIf all that isn't enough, they even got Hans Zimmer to score the damn thing. Icing on the cake.",

            "content": "A mind blowing intellectual caper!\n\nChristopher Nolan directs his sci-fi thriller Inception (2010) with a keen eye, creative mind, vast potential, and astute precision. Inception is sleek thanks to Christopher Nolan's inventive direction and original script. Inception is famous for its shocking twists, breathtaking cinematography, and high concept narrative. Nolan's ambitious direction ends you stunning you with strange and enticing visuals, enthralling action sequences, and groundbreaking visual effects. The CGI holds up as cities fold unto themselves and worlds collapse, while I also appreciate Nolan's dedication to practical effects like the revolving hotel hallway fight that's already as iconic as it is impressive. Inception is mind boggling due to Nolan's creative directorial vision and unique focused auteur style. No other director could have crafted Inception.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is heartbreaking and enthralling as the lead Dom Cobb. His mind robber is so cool and in control until his past tears at his heart. DiCaprio is devastating during a particular hotel room scene on a balcony. Marion Cotillard delivers her greatest acting in Inception as Mal Cobb. Her chemistry is apparent with DiCaprio. She sweeps you off your feet with surprise appearances, sultry looks, and seductive words, but Cotillard uses her warm eyes and sincere voice to command your attention. Together, DiCaprio and Cotillard elevate an already magnificent film into an instant classic.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt is too cool as the operator of the mind breaching equipment. Inception remains some of his best acting that I like more every time I watch him here. Ellen Page is astounding as Ariadne the architect of the dream worlds. Her mind is sharp as are her comebacks as DiCaprio's foil, but it is Page's empathy for the suffering of others in Inception that makes her character so sympathetic and likable. Ellen Page has never acted better than within the tender affection she portrays in Inception.\n\nTom Hardy is hilarious as Zak Eames. He's just effortless in Inception. Ken Watanabe is so smooth and captivating in Inception as Mr. Saito. I do not want to spoil a single moment of his revelation of a performance. Cillian Murphy is fun to watch him get duped in Inception as Robert Fischer, but his final farewell to his father, played by a phenomenal Pete Postlethwaite, is just soul crushing to see.\n\nMichael Caine is astute and poignant as Stephen Miles in a great scene as DiCaprio's foil. Dileep Rao is funny as Yusuf. Tom Berenger is excellent and particular as Peter Browning. Lukas Haas has an interesting cameo as Nash the architect. Keep an eye out for the flight attendant as that's Christopher Nolan's cousin Miranda Nolan! Lastly, Talulah Riley is gorgeous and alluring in her cameo as The Blonde.\n\nChristopher Nolan's original script demonstrates his writing prowess at creating an imaginative science fiction story centered around a mental heist to insert an idea into someone's head. His intricate plot of diving deeper into layers of dreams within dreams once confused me, but upon revisiting Inception, I actually understood the entire plot because Nolan goes out of his way to include you by indoctrinating you into this chaotic world through his informative dialogue and perceptive nuance. His ideas are ambitious and unique with intelligent thoughtfulness, but always accessible to the audience through his pristine style and common language. Inception is incredibly well written down to every clever line. I have to mention Nolan's heartfelt themes and inclusion of emotional connections to engage the viewer despite their certain confusion. Inserting a father and son's bond with a husband and wife's estrangement is genius levels of depth on top of all the dream diving. The start washing into the end's shoreline is just too smart.\n\nLee Smith's editing is mind numbing to think about how he spliced together the exact order of each dream level sequence. Nolan and him must have talked for hours about Inception's sequencing and editing style. Wally Pfister's cinematography is sleek and striking with some of cinema's most iconic shots: the city folding on top of itself, the mirrors reframing the shot, stairs appearing out of nowhere, to the gorgeous shorelines of consciousness in Limbo. So many lovely wide shots envelop Inception's cold methodical world in a sense of wonder. The production design makes everything look sterile and crisp, so that anything can appear suddenly and look natural.\n\nHans Zimmer's legendary score for Inception is infamous for his blaring bursts of sound and beloved for his epic scope of sonic noise. Zimmer composed some of his best material for a gripping score to accompany Inception's captivating action. The costumes and make-up look like a Tom Ford or Gucci commercial, they are that clean cut and slimming. You can count all the cool suits. Marion Cotillard's dresses are simply sublime on her.\n\nIn all, Inception is an all time great film of astounding originality and creative filmmaking. Christopher Nolan clearly wanted to outdo himself and he ended up directing one of his best features with Inception.",

            "content": "\"Inception\" is Christopher Nolan's science fiction drama, released in 2010 and that grossed more than $800 million worldwide (film is definitely successful, because the budget is $160 million).\nChristopher Nolan is creaing this art perfomance as a director, screenwriter and one of the producers.\nOperator - Wally Pfister\nComposer - Hans Zimmer\nArtists: Guy Diaz, Luke Freeborn, Brad Ricoeur\n   The main character Cobb is a unique thief: he steals valuable secrets from the depths of the subconscious during sleep, when the human mind is most vulnerable. Cobb's abilities and capabilities made him a valuable player in the world of espionage, but they also turned him into an eternal fugitive and deprived him of his family.\nAnd now Cobb has a chance to correct mistakes. He, along with his team, will have to implement the idea, and not steal it.\n   I'll start with the cons.\nFirstly, the visualization is messy. The characters of the picture are engaged in espionage, penetrating the dreams of their victims. Does that actually look as a dream? Not. Rather, there are continuous labyrinths of surrealism and empty absurdity. For example, cool concept of the Cobb's subconscious multi-level world could be made more spectacular.\nSecondly, in fact, \"Inception\" is mainly an action movie of the 21st century, that attempts to also include drama and look thought-provoking.\nThirdly, not a single character is perfomed enough, and the script line with the wife of the protagonist looks dull. As a viewer, I was completely uninterested in Cobb's experiences and his relationship with his wife.\nFurther, druing the film, the feeling that \"now, it will definitely begin!\" doesn't leave you. But nothing begins. There is no goddamn madness.\nIn this chaotic hurricane, not a damn thing is clear. And he makes the pathos public exaggerate the meaning of the \"Inception\" and include it in all kinds of movie tops for all time, and to justify saying that this movie is not for everyone.\nPassing through pros, the main plus in the film is music. Hans Zimmer's music fits the \"drama\" of the film.\nThe second plus is imagination - the integration of ideas through sleep and so on will excite any viewer, because it is original and unusual. Nolan even developed a whole concept - the creation of sleep, a sense of time. But it turned out far-fetched.",

Therefore one of my big requirements for a good movie is great worldbuilding, something Inception did both literally and figuratively by not outright revealing too many details but still giving us enough to go on the establish a clear idea of the world we are witnessing.

            "content": "Christopher Nolan has become a victim of overhype in my eyes as it is a shame that a perfectly fine director of semi-intellectual popcorn movies was raised to the status of a modern day Stanley Kubrick in the view of internet fan boys. In part because of all this raving that I can't help but feel slightly disappointed when I watch The Dark Knight (2008) and find another silly superhero film dressed up as a pseudo-intellectual story about guilt and fear. This film too suffers from presenting itself as high minded and intellectual when it's best moments come from the technical mastery of Nolan. He has always struggled to develop compelling characters and make the audience care about the relationships between them and this is largely what causes this film to be a passable but fairly forgettable psychological action thriller.\n\nDom Cobb, Leonardo DiCaprio, is traumatized by the suicide of his wife Mal, Marion Cotillard, who complicates his professional life as when he is attempting to insert thoughts into people's subconscious she interrupts his thoughts and he becomes distracted. He is hired by Japanese businessman Mr. Saito, Ken Watanabe, to convince the son of his business rival Robert Fischer, Cillian Murphy, to dismantle his business. He puts together a team to carry out this mission and the inquisitive young Ariadne, Ellen Page, probes him for information on his past and the reason that his ex-wife keeps appearing while he is attempting to plant ideas in the minds of others. When the group he has assembled become trapped in the subconscious of Fischer they realize that they must use their ingenuity and smarts to achieve their goal while also making it out alive. Meanwhile Cobb comes to terms with the decision that his wife made, partly caused by his placing ideas in her mind, and chooses to return to happiness in any form.\n\nIn today's environment of superhero films almost every movie has dazzling visuals with incredible special effects and mind-bending visuals so it is hard to cite visuals as the reason to see a film. Yes, it is exciting to see cityscapes brought towards us at an alarming rate and then to witness Page, with her tiny frame, mount this vertical street but there is the feeling that it is lacking. With all of the obvious visual homages to Kubrick it also lets itself down as the baroque style room that Fischer farewells his dying father in resembles the room seen in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) but we can't help wanting the deep themes of that film instead of a disinteresting plot about a volatile couple. I needed more from this film and I didn't receive it which was frustrating because I began watching the film with such high hopes and that there were points where the film came close to them made it all the more maddening.\n\nNolan's inability to present emotionally developed or engaging characters and relationships hampers him seriously as a writer and filmmaker and that this film dedicates a significant portion of it's running time to a relationship that fails to engage hurts it. We know very little about Mal and she comes across as icy but emotionally volatile, as many women are, but she seems more like a plot device than a real character and her sudden emotional outburst are unexplained with an actress as fine as Cotillard failing to carry them off. Even seeing the children that Cobb and Mal abandons fails to elicit sympathy as we feel nothing for either of the parents and know virtually nothing about these children that would make us care for them. The end of the film wants to be profound as we understand that our protagonist wants his family so much that he is willing to accept living in an illusion in order to be with them but because we do not know Cobb and his emotional turmoil and Mal very obviously exists to propel the plot forward I was not emotionally moved at all.\n\nOther irritations were brought on by the writing of the film as the other female character in the film, Ariadne, exists to ask the male characters around her questions about the process of \u2018inception' and then have them explain to her and the audience the various plot mechanics. I wish that more had been done to flesh out these characters and perhaps with a bit more work the film would have been the intelligent popcorn film that it was hailed as.",

What P.T. Anderson did for straight three hours in Magnolia, you are going to have that same exhausting experience in this visual galore. Inception deals with a metaphor heist commanded by an expert extractor named Cobb whose only dream is to go home. Away from the action and the skills he masters at, and in order to reach home, he goes through the final test by embracing and learning the first thought entering his mind.\n\nI remember I was ahead of Nolan- or so I thought. I claimed to know his method of decoding a subject and then he coded this cinematic marvel in front of me. So here's how he goes through a script. He treats them like a sketch show. Simple as that. And just like in a sketch show there are plenty of sketches- duh!- surfing around it. Now, a sketch is actually a double edged sword. In the sense that it needs a start, a middle act and a final act, in every three minutes. And once you get over it- which is usually engaging for its compactness- you have to come up with an entire new idea. But this is why it favours majorly on Nolan's side. Since, he has to deal with the same world, he creates, celebrates and destroys the world in each act that also contributes to the bigger picture completing the circle and leaving us satisfied. Another thing to note here is, how he celebrates. In an \"action\" espionage thriller, you would expect some punches and bullets and explosives. But the way he celebrates- or in layman terms exaggerate or gloats- is by envisioning his germ of the idea on different set pieces and locations. Ergo, his action is never your typical luxurious action. Just watch Joseph Gorden Lewitt surviving on that hotel without or under influenced gravity.\n\nScience over emotions. Yes, I think as much as brilliant the subconscious play and the contingent unknown backup plans work on the film, I found myself cheated on the emotional background that our protagonist Cobb, played remorsefully by Leonardo DiCaprio, goes through. Don't get me wrong, the back story is incredibly rich, it's just the way it is treated. It is like after every- thrice to be precise- major event, Ellen Page and DiCaprio are told to reveal little by little information about the past in order to manipulate us. But this is just a minor flaw in this Nolan's masterpiece that not only subjugates but even belittles writers like us.",

Thank you to Christopher Nolan because I think that if this had been made by anyone other than him, it wouldn't have stood out, but his passionate directing and intricate storytelling really blow me away. I do not see a flaw in this film : really good acting (DiCaprio gives a chillingly dark yet emotionally powerful performance and Joseph Gordon Levitt, my favorite, also does an amazing job. ), gold standard direction, a screenplay that is just like the direction, the terrific quality soundtrack that matches the mood, and, the exceptional visuals). Filmmaking on the highest scale, visually and psychologically breathtaking and the ensemble's chemistry is beautiful the entire concept of \"Inception\" is amazing. And WHAT AN ENDING !

The premise is super unique and makes for an extremely interesting and different action movie experience. As a movie, it plays out similar to a heist film but with no actual heist and a much more complex plot.. Thanks to the dreaming concept, there are some points of special effects that are actually done really well and look/fit perfectly. This also applies to the well-timed speed changes, going from regular speed to slow-motion without feeling at all out of place. It is paced well and hits every beat that it tries to hit. Even if you don't particularly like the idea or genre of the film itself, I feel that it is a movie that everyone should see at some point as a representation of well-made film that takes advantage of modern effects without using them overwhelmingly.",

            "content": "The best things about Cristopher Nolan's \"Inception\" are the idea and the music. The idea is that people are able to share dreams, and to have dreams within dreams, if they have the right equipment and know what they're doing. They can even plant ideas in other people's minds through a difficult and delicate process called \"inception\" (as opposed to the more usual and much easier \"extraction,\" which involves stealing thoughts from others). What makes the movie so interesting is that the \"mark,\" or the person the inception team is targeting, doesn't know he's dreaming. Yeah, that's pretty cool. \n\nThe movie never explains how inception works--the tech guy just flips open a silver briefcase and hooks people up with wires. And the whole idea of multiple dreams-within-dreams doesn't seem too plausible. But I was willing to suspend disbelief for the sake of the movie. (If you could believe that machines used humans for batteries in \"The Matrix,\" you shouldn't have any trouble believing the premise here.)\n\nThe music, also by Nolan, is pulsating and effectively used, constantly driving the tension and providing much of the movie's energy. \n\nIn the end, however, Inception is just a series of inter-spliced action scenes, some of which are preposterous. Only the music, and the fact that we keep being awed that these are all dreams within dreams, make any of it the least bit interesting.\n\nThe real problem with the film is that it's not about anything important. Well, Leonardo's character and the story about his wife are important on a personal level, but the plot surrounding the movie's act of inception by DiCaprio's team holds no interest for us. Who cares if some rich guy breaks up his father's business empire? Who cares what cartel controls the oil market? It's just not important, and the movie doesn't even try to convince us that it is. Instead, the majority of screen time is devoted to implausible car chases and fights all the way down through the dream levels. The penultimate dream level, which takes place on a snowy mountain, has one guy defeating an army of enemy agents, with the whole thing looking a lot more like a battle against inept Storm Troopers from \"The Empire Strikes Back\" than Nolan probably intended.\n\nWhy couldn't Nolan have made a movie about saving the world, or at least some small part of it? Then I might have cared about the outcome. But no, our hero just wants to get home by helping a foreign oil baron.\n\nAnd the bit at the end that has everyone watching the movie 20 times looking for clues? That strikes me as nothing more than a simple editing trick to leave us with some ambiguity. It makes the movie seem a lot cleverer than it really is.\n\nThere was a lot to like about Inception, and it's fun to watch. The directing, acting, music, production, cinematography, and pace are all excellent, and the idea of controlling others' dreams is mind-bending. DeCaprio's storyline, which is really what the movie wants to be about, is good too. Unfortunately, it's all wrapped in nonsense that isn't worth trying to unravel.",

Yet the story would have us believe that she would fail to recognize the one state that is not so malleable - the state of woke reality.  This flaw broke the central premise of the movie for me.

Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) doesn't steal things, he steals ideas. By projecting himself deep into the subconscious of his targets, he can glean information that even the best computer hackers can't get to. In the world of corporate espionage, Cobb is the ultimate weapon. But even weapons have their weakness, and when Cobb loses everything, he's forced to embark on one final mission in a desperate quest for redemption. This time, Cobb won't be harvesting an idea, but sowing one. Should he and his team of specialists succeed, they will have discovered a new frontier in the art of psychic espionage. They've planned everything to perfection, and they have all the tools to get the job done. Their mission is complicated, however, by the sudden appearance of a malevolent foe that seems to know exactly what they're up to, and precisely how to stop them.\n\nEverything with this movie is amazing, I mean every-single-thing, from the very beginning to the very end, you never get bored, you never get tired of this amazing 2h 28min masterpiece, you know why? Because this movie has a story that it never ends during the movie, to be more clear, every moment a new thing reveals so you won't get bored of it!\n\nThe performances also are talented, everyone was more than amazing, I was amazed of how they were acting! Also the CGI, it was pretty amazing, it was sinless, actually everything about this movie is sinless.. anyways... The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, what can I say? Stunning, I.. loved.. it!! And now, the direction, every shot was well-directed, the direction really really was amazing, Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all the time.. actually, this movie contain lots of my favorite stuff: favorite director (Christopher Nolan), favorite composer (Hans Zimmer) and my favorite actor (Tom Hardy).\n\nThe plot didn't explain too much to keep you excited and hype, also it didn't set up the characters cause they will be explained later on, and I meant to say \"explained\" because these characters are super-complex. After the plot the movie took a great twist with the first act by being  little pit clear, you think? The second act came to make it complicated again, but don't worry, the third act is here to help you by setting everything in the right place.\n\nInception is an A+ movie!\n\nAlright, guys, lots of Christopher Nolan movies coming up thanks -as always- for reading my review, hope you like, and if you do, you can check all of my reviews right here.",

            "content": "Inception is a Sci-Fi, Action-adventure film written, co-produced and directed by Christopher Nolan, his 7th feature film of which he has been director. The narrative follows a thief called Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who uses dream-sharing technology to steal corporate secrets. However, when approached with the task of planting an idea in a CEO's, he must recruit a team to try and complete this. This film has a star-studded lineup (although it wasn't considered this at the time of release), including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe and many others.\n\nDespite being renowned for having a very difficult narrative to follow, which I also found upon my first viewing, I believe that after seeing it a couple of times and suspending your disbelief, that it is an extremely clever story which Nolan is telling. Even more so knowing that it is an original screenplay.\n\nAt the time of release, as mentioned previously, the lineup were not as well-known as they are today, especially the like of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy. Although, looking back at this film with the knowledge of how all of these actors and actresses developed, it is clear to see why. Every single person who stars in this film is exceptional, not a false note anywhere. There isn't a moment where I felt like I was watching a someone act, it all felt very genuine and real, which is key in making the audience suspend their disbelief, directly helping them to understand the plot further. Tom Hardy (who I am a very huge fan of for his work in Bronson, Locke, Legend etc.) really smashes this performance out of the park as the lovable Eames.\n\nSome of the set pieces that we see in this film, the rotating hallway scene immediately comes to mind, are outstanding and even hold up to, if not surpass, those that we see in releases today. The numerous moments that made my jaw physically drop when I first saw them is what takes this film from great, to epic.\n\nHans Zimmer incredible score that really adds weight to the emotion that you feel sitting in the audience, cannot possibly go unmentioned. Zimmer has frequently worked with Nolan on a number of films, including The Dark Knight Trilogy, Interstellar, Dunkirk and Man Of Steel. Yet again, the two styles blend perfectly, creating a very hard hitting and tense atmosphere throughout the film, which I found especially prominent in the final scene, amplifying the \"dramatic-ness\" I felt.\n\nAll in all however, this is my favourite film. Christopher Nolan never fails to impress.",

For essentially an action blockbuster, the plot is so complex and yet holds together better than films with more basic premises. Chris Nolan's personal and totally original masterpiece makes you think and gasp all the way through. In a world where invading and sharing dreams is possible, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ellen Page, Joesph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hardy dive deeper and deeper into Cillian Murphy' military trained subconscious in order to implant an idea. The set pieces are spell bounding and outstanding. For a film that hits the two and a half hour mark, it absolutely speeds over like freight train. Special shout out to Hans Zimmer's score which expertly integrates the fabulous Edith Paif's 'Non, je ne regrette rien'- slowing it down to create the iconic Inception BAAAAHHHMMMS, which every movie trailer now seems to \nhave borrowed.

It has been said that Hollywood relies too much on special effects to cover lazy storytelling; not so with Inception, where truly stunning visuals only supplement what you'll really be talking about: the story, what it means, how it moved you, and how shockingly original it is. I've never seen anything like it, either in concept or in narrative structure. Neither have I attended, in a long time, a film that gave my brain such a workout.\n\nThis is a movie that expects you to pay attention and make connections. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a heartbreaking performance, leading a cast of top-notch actors playing interesting characters in a film that appears to be a science-fiction action/heist caper (a rather unique concept in itself), but is actually about guilt, the desire for redemption, and the raw power of simple ideas. Director Christopher Nolan, as he did with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, takes something fantastic and paints it in realistic tones. This is what unbridled imagination, combined with intelligence, emotion, and talent looks like on film. It is mentally and emotionally challenging. It also has some terrific action (including a physics-bending fight sequence that is jaw-dropping) and is very creative in its use of cinematography, editing, and music. Though comparatively light on language, with no sexual material and action violence where physical harm is not what's at stake (you'll understand when you see it), Inception is nonetheless not recommended for anyone younger than teens due to its complexity and intense subject matter.",

            "content": "Intelligent, unique and exceedingly thrilling, Inception is that rare Summer blockbuster that strikes a defy balance between being both a visually striking masterpiece as well as an intellectually made film. The performances are excellent all around and the film is full of interesting characters. Leonardo DiCaprio leads the film with a profoundly layered and complex performance as Cobb. While at first the character seems confident and bold from the outset, it becomes pretty clear there's more than meets the eye and his tragic backstory is conveyed perfectly through his performance. The rest of the cast do just as well, although the development between them ranges from some to not as much, if only due to the amount of people onscreen. With an interesting concept concerning a machine that allows for others to implant and or steal information and ideas from the minds of others, it fully delivers and allows that to take center stage, and rightfully so. It's a unique premise and as the film becomes more and more complex as it wears on, it's an achievement in itself that it doesn't lose itself along the way. There's also a surprising amount of heart as well, as the film has a dramatic subplot that actually fits well into the plot. There are occasional moments where the exposition segments can get a bit heavy however as the film frequently has to slow down to ensure everyone is caught up but thankfully they're few and far between and after the first act they all but vanish. To top it all off, the ending is satisfying, if also ambiguous, but so are all the best. Christopher Nolan's direction is just fantastic, as he intricately weaves the outre sci fi elements of the dreamscape with the dramatic angle that the central romance requires without overdoing on either. Probably his biggest achievement though is how well he's able to juggle all of the film's moving layers, especially when the film moves into its third act and everything becomes very complex, reflecting the confidence of an increasingly reassured director. For all of it's visceral elements, the stakes feel more than justified in Inception. The editing seamlessly moves between the many different dream sequences with ease, and the intensity of the sound editing only elevates it all while capturing the sense of lucid dreaming. Arguably above all else though, the film is a visual masterpiece. Its almost gratifying to see a film reach so high in its visual ambitions without skimping by on its narrative. Although it may have its flaws, Inception is nevertheless an ambitious thriller that truly shows a director at the top of his game and the full extent of what a blockbuster can really be.",

The film is very plot driven, which is understandable given the time constraints of a roughly 2 hour movie that dives into some very complex ideas.  This comes at the cost of character development, which means that every character outside of Leonardo's Cobb is essentially a completely 1 dimensional plot device.  This is greatly assisted by having an all-star cast of naturally charismatic actors adding subtle hints of character and personality where none exists in the script, and it is one of the reasons this film would never work as a small budget affair.  This film embraces it's overblown, self serious traits and combined with it's incredible (and probably very expensive) special effects, it manages to make the absolutely ridiculous quite believable a lot of the time.  There are likely going to be nagging questions in your mind that arise from the inconsistencies of trying to impose pseudo-scientific rational onto dream logic, but the film moves at such a breakneck pace with such a great feeling of momentum and tension that it is easy to ignore these problems.  Leonardo Dicaprio gives an incredible performance that helps to elevates this script from the B-movie goofiness it could easily become into something that feels relatable and emotionally haunting.  Overall, while this isn't quite my favourite Chris Nolan film, it is one of his most entertaining and audacious.  It is also one of the most ambitious and bold huge budget hollywood films in recent memory and is truly an experience to sit through, especially in theaters.",

            "content": "Inception is written and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious, and is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for a seemingly impossible task: \"inception\", the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious, Practically invading personal dream, and it can create new dreams after dream and after dream. The ensemble cast additionally includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.\n\nFirst time of seeing Inception has to be one of the most creative movies I have ever seen of this decade!! I'm very serious, seeing the score on rotten tomatoes is quite flawless from professional review were's. So to say it is not a science-fiction action film, it's practically a drama telling of the sense of drama of the science of the mind of the human brain. This is one of the reasons why I love Christopher Nolan because of the structure of studying human beings. Out of any outcome of the exposition of the story or the exposition of a story or anything. \n\nThe exposition of the story is not even that noticeable really, once you first start the movie, you're in a practically new world, The world has never been brought up. But once he gets through the story are the first act you put the puzzle pieces together, and then do explain the pieces of the puzzle. This movie is a great example of how exposition should work and should be the blueprint of what to use and what not to use for exposition scenes. \n\nAs I just said that this was not an action science fiction film but it is, it's surprisingly a drama, very well use with Christopher Nolan prove it from his predecessor the Dark Knight. In the middle of the story Leonardo Caprio's character had a wife, they spent all their life in the dream world, once they left the dreamworld they came back to reality, and it causes him pain for his wife and she killed herself and blamed it on the husband. It was quite interesting seeing that scean, because the film is still not putting the puzzle together. \n\nOnce when they get to their target, the wife intervenes with the dreams, so she can have her husband back in the dreamworld. Until the end of the movie it has to be one of the best ambiguous endings of cinema history. I will not spoil it, but it is required to see this magnificent film. \n\nWhat I like about Christopher Nolan's films you really have to think, it doesn't matter by if it's an action film from the Dark Knight movies, or anything that he does you really have to think throughout his films and I swear I really love about Christopher Nolan. I surprisingly I have no flaws once again with Christopher Nolan. This movie is phenomenally smart, vary smart!! The persons brain is the second character of the film. The brain is not featured in the film whatsoever, but the audience that is watching the film. \n\nYou can practically watch this film over and over again. But every time when I go see inception, I always find something new. Back into thousand 10 when I first saw the film I was in a trance.. I saw this film at least six times of that year in the movie theater, and the Blu-ray of the film is quite abuse from my Blu-ray player watching it over and over again. I just love to watch this film because there's always something new with this film. Sometimes it is a bad telling of the story and sometimes it's a great telling of the story. \n\nI want to find very interesting that is very relates to an anime called \"Paprika\" a 2006 film directed Satoshi Kon, I film  genius himself Rest In Peace!! Paprika what is an is the blueprint for inception, I highly recommend seeing the film to I give it a a perfect 10 for that film as well. \n\nBut with the right sources and the right timing and the right blueprint and inspiration of a couple of animes that Christopher Nolan loved and endeared. Really does show that anime can inspire directors and a great story can inspire viewing audience of like. With the dark Knight and the rest of his nine films like inception will go down in history that this film will be never be forgotten. \n\nGrade: A Perfect 10",

Although, to be fair, the practical effects are pretty good. The zero-gravity dream which Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a big part of is breathtaking since we also get some fun shots out of the bargain. The action sequences are as well choreographed as the ones present within The Dark Knight Trilogy and Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an effective performance. In fact, the main villain in the film is...himself. Well, his subconscious anyway since his wife Marion Cotilliard won't leave him alone continously messing up their plan to plant an idea in Cillian Murphy's head. I kinda accepted its complexity since before the actual story begins, the dreams are revealed as surprises. What do we call Inception, then?

Yes oddly enough, when compared to his other amazing filmography, it really is rather striking how much fun Inception actually has with itself as Nolan brings an unusual level of self-aware indulgence in his ambitious ideas and story to create more of a summer blockbuster feel. It's certainly not a vibe that one would expect then, but it is equally a very pleasant surprise that comes from the script - which leaves plenty of room for humour and grin-ensuing action - and the cast (in particular DiCaprio) who bring incredible life and whit to each scenario.\nOf course though, we are still talking about Christopher Nolan, so don't think for a moment that any of the edge and intelligence is gone either because it quite simply hasn't. In fact, on a technical level Inception ranks right up there with the director's best, as it packs bags of conceptual ideas, breathtaking visuals, and crucially this time - a brilliantly interwoven lead character to hook and engage you in the whole experience.\n\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Because of the way it deals each hand, it's not as profound and powerful as you might think, and some of the time it spends enjoying itself is time it could be delving even deeper into its themes and supporting characters.\n\nVERDICT: Engaging, clever and downright fun; 'Inception' proves that if Nolan lets his hair down, it doesn't mean he lets a strand fall out of place. What a great blockbuster this is.",

The movie is a science-fiction thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the main character (Cobb), Joseph Gordon-Levitt as his best friend (Arthur), Ellen Page as Cobb's apprentice (Ariane) and Marion Cotillar as Cobb's ex-wife. The movie takes place in France, Australia, Canada and the United-States. The movie is in our modern day era.\nAt the beginning of the film, we learn that Cobb makes a living as being a dream thief. Cobb steals dream information of powerful businessmen. He enters into a subconscious reality of others where he does dream stealing called \"extraction\" (by taking information from others' thoughts through their subconscious dream state). In the confusion of the film's drama, Cobb is accused of killing his wife, this accusation loses him custody of his children.\nLater in the movie, Cobb starts working for Saito, (a former victim of one of Cobb's 'dream state' organized robberies). Saito is CEO of an International energy company. Saito wants Cobb to implant an idea in the future CEO of a rival company in order for the firm to go bankrupt. In exchange for this act, Saito vows to pay off Cobb's murder sentence, allowing him to take custody of his children.\nCobb starts doing dream implanting called \"inception\" (by making his subject fall into a dream state, in order to manipulate his decisions). After the thought implanted, his subject believes he has a brilliant idea for his firm but in reality, it makes his company fail. We will follow him through his journey. \nThe movie really takes the time explaining every aspect of dream \"extraction\" and \"inception\". The music composed by the well-known author Hans Zimmer keeps us focused during the whole movie. The music is used in key moments to intensify the emotions. The frame shots are incredible with impressive CGI effects. The movie passes an important message about letting go of the past. The movie is also very action packed and has a deep story to tell. It's a movie with a good cast, resulting in good actor performances. The only bad point is the length of the movie which could be considered too long by some.

It has been said that Hollywood relies too much on special effects to cover lazy storytelling; not so with Inception, where truly stunning visuals only supplement what you'll really be talking about: the story, what it means, how it moved you, and how shockingly original it is. I've never seen anything like it, either in concept or in narrative structure. Neither have I attended, in a long time, a film that gave my brain such a workout.\n\nThis is a movie that expects you to pay attention and make connections. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a heartbreaking performance, leading a cast of top-notch actors playing interesting characters in a film that appears to be a science-fiction action/heist caper (a rather unique concept in itself), but is actually about guilt, the desire for redemption, and the raw power of simple ideas. Director Christopher Nolan, as he did with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, takes something fantastic and paints it in realistic tones. This is what unbridled imagination, combined with intelligence, emotion, and talent looks like on film. It is mentally and emotionally challenging. It also has some terrific action (including a physics-bending fight sequence that is jaw-dropping) and is very creative in its use of cinematography, editing, and music. Though comparatively light on language, with no sexual material and action violence where physical harm is not what's at stake (you'll understand when you see it), Inception is nonetheless not recommended for anyone younger than teens due to its complexity and intense subject matter.",

There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. \n\n2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. \n\n3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.\n\n4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. \n\n5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. \n\n6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.\n\nCons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. \n\n2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. \n\n3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. \n\nIn conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. \n\nI highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's mind bending crime thriller achieves something special, it is both a big budget action thriller and a thought provoking piece centred on dreams and the perception of reality. Few films are able to appeal equally to both the popcorn movie goer wanting to see great explosions and the serious film lover who wants a complex and artistic piece that will be expertly constructed. Nolan first honed this unique ability with Batman Begins and perfected it with The Dark Knight, and with Inception he has created another masterpiece.\n\nThe riveting story follows Dom Cobb (the ever brilliant Leonardo DiCaprio), an expert at stealing hidden information from inside people's subconscious by entering their dreams, as he accepts the near impossible job of planting an idea inside someone's mind. It sounds complicated and a bit mind-boggling but Nolan skilfully meets the needs of casual viewers and those wanting more. There is a tad too much exposition at times but the complexities of dream heists are presented well.  For those who embrace the story and its world, there is so much to take in and ponder, but the perfect pacing and expertly crafted action allows those who might get slightly lost at times to still have a fun experience. Although DiCaprio is the star, it is the perfectly chosen ensemble cast that make the film so convincing. Cillian Murphy and Marion Cotillard in particular are outstanding. It is not only the actors that are shared with The Dark Knight trilogy but also composer Hans Zimmer, who once again creates an atmospheric score that rounds out every scene beautifully.\n\nI mentioned expertly crafted action because the film features such unique and well-made set pieces. The world of dreams is full of great potential and Nolan harnesses this. The highlight is the fight scene that takes place as gravity shifts around the characters, which was made with practical effects. This practicality makes it completely unforgettable. Even with a focus on practical effects where possible, the film uses ground-breaking GCI to convey the reality defying dream worlds. \n\nOn the flip side to collapsing buildings and fist fights is the insight into the human mind that the film explores so intriguingly. Dreams are still relatively mysterious and the film attempts to unlock some of these mysteries. The themes it explores go far deeper than regular blockbusters and the ending shot is a mind blowing moment that has rightfully caused so much debate over its meaning.\n\nDespite its complexities, it is Inception's accessibility that lies at the heart of its brilliance. It asks you to think but equally wants you to sit back and enjoy what you are watching. Personally I thought it wasn't too action heavy or difficult to understand to put off either audience. It has something for everyone. It is expert filmmaking that can be enjoyed and discussed by all.",

Over time, I've found myself returning to this movie again and again and again, always interested in watching every moment. Nolan shines when he can sink his teeth into mechanics, and that made this the perfect project for him. Using the platform of people who can build worlds, he built his world! Nolan, as a world-builder gives the impression that he knows exactly how each mechanic works and its level of mastery. His success is realized when you and I, the viewers, think about what we saw and what the possibilities and ramifications are for the characters. Nolan masterfully navigated the idea of a dream and reminded us all what an original movie should look like. I rate this 5 stars as it truly never gets old, but gets better each time I watch it.",

This movie will work best under multiple viewings as certain characters and their motives become more clear and overall, more connections can be made. Almost every scene has some intellectual value and will give you the chills. Overall Inception has a very intellectual story, one that some viewers may not be able to follow, but for those who can, this film is something truly special.",

            "content": "Inception is an excellent example of what a highly skilled director with a stellar ensemble when a studio trusts them enough to make what they envision. Watching it feels like being a part of Christopher Nolan's dream. The plot revolves around Leonardo Dicaprio's character, Dom Cobb, and his team. They have access to a machine which allows them to enter the dreams of others in order to extract information, however following an incident with his ex wife, Dom is forced to flee from his home. When he's offered the chance to return home, he quickly accepts but the conditions are that he must use his machine to plant an idea into the mind of a young man called Robert Fischer Jr., played by Cillian Murphy. Inception is supposedly impossible, but Cobb is certain it's possible. So Cobb assembles a team to complete his mission. \nThis team includes Joseph Gorden-Levitt's character, Arthur, who is by the book person. He is used largely for exposition but has his own moments in the spotlight later in the film including an excellent scene in a rotating corridor. The cinematography on this scene is brilliant and the fact that they used practical effects to make it make its all the more brilliant. One of the biggest flaws in the film is the amount of exposition it has to give however with such a complex plot you feel as though this is necessary. Ellen Page's character, Ariadne, is used to promote Arthur's exposition. She is also used to keep Dom in check on an emotional level. As you learn through the film, Dom is quite emotionally unstable and Ariadne helps him control these emotions. Tom hardy's character, Eames acts as a foil to Arthur. He is enthusiastic and willing to take risks.  He is also a huge badass and provides some comic relief. \nInception is a fun movie to watch. Visually it is stunning and the acting and writing is great. However some of the exposition does drag however most of the exposition is contained within the first act. The tone of the movie is great and its really interesting to play with the ideas of dream. The plot is very complex and some may find it difficult to follow however if attention is paid while watching it, it's is highly enjoyable.",

It feels as if Nolan was constrained by the genre here and wasn't able to delve into some of the themes with as much depth as he could have had he not been working on a Hollywood Blockbuster. \n\nNonetheless, this is a well-crafted and entertaining film, even if it doesn't quite achieve what it might have set out to.

            "content": "There is no way to approach \"Inception\" without comparing to Satoshi Kon's stellar anime \"Paprika,\" which was released about half-decade earlier and dealt with the same themes (dream terrorists, machines that can read/create dreams, our inability to distinguish between the two states, etc.) At first glance, Christopher Nolan ripped off the anime big-time; the weird conglomeration of imagery in the film's early moments felt familiar; about a dozen other visual motifs, (including the lady breaking glass in order to get to the \"reality\" behind it,) also screamed out \"Rip off!\" \nHowever, I still found \"Inception\" to be an incredibly original film because of its focused script, highly-concentrated delivery, and storyline that doesn't shy away from appealing to viewer's intellectual abilities. If \"Paprika\" was an overview of many ideas dealing with the subconscious, \"Inception\" takes a few of these ideas and analyzes them more thoroughly than a laboratory scientist on the verge of a scientific breakthrough. Some viewers may find the dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream harder to follow than Monty Python deductive reasoning, but the film delivers as strongly as any of Christopher Nolan's best efforts. This is the director's most Hitchcock film yet; the tense music and choppy editing go together in a way only Nolan can pull it off. The layered dream concept was interesting, with each layer getting deeper and deeper into the subconscious. However, I longed for wackier, impossible visuals. The one scene where the cityscape is literally bent upside down was awesome, as was the sequence with exploding flowers and cobblestone bricks near the cafe. However, such moments were far and few between. I longed for the parade of nonsensical electronic appliances in \"Paprika,\" stuff found only in the deepest reservoirs of our minds (or down-the-rabbit-hole.) \nThe film had a speedy first act (which was my favorite.) I enjoyed the explanation of the projections, the process to \"kick\" patients awake, and how these artificial dreams are constructed the same way architects use blueprints and CG simulations. However, the actual plan, once executed, seemed to drag, and not just because it took about a half hour for the van to plunge into the water. Later in the film, however, there were too many repetitive visuals of floating men in hotel rooms. After two minutes of it I felt like saying: \"I get it. It is a neat visual effect. Shall we move on?\" \nThe cast was top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio, once again, proves himself to be one of the finest actors in Hollywood today, and we are also treated to great performances from \"Juno\"'s Ellen Page as well as the usual Nolan suspects:  Tom hardy, Michael Caine, and Cillian Murphy. \nIn the end, I was impressed. The film took an interesting concept and ran away with it. While it did not pose the stark originality of Satoshi Kon's \"Paprika,\" (or use as many of the mind-bending concepts,) \"Inception\" is a refreshing breeze of originality in an era where everything seems to be sequels, reboots, or superheroes. An original story that appeals to the cognitive intellectual curiosity is welcome. We need more movies like this.",

Shure there have been movies with dreams as the setting before like the famous nightmare on elm street saga but this was the first to show dreams in a more interesting and ( dare I say) more dangerous way. could you imagine going into someone else's dream? if you die you don't wake up you go to limbo for years and years. if you see this movie playing on TV or see a DVD of it and you think about skipping it,you must be dreaming!",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan is a brilliant filmmaker who captivates us with the unique universes he creates within his films. He brought us into his dark, incredible version of Batman in the Dark Knight Trilogy. He takes us into space and time in his most recent film, Interstellar. In between the Dark Knight and the Dark Knight Rises, Nolan took us into our own minds with Inception. He created a spectacular world and story around our dreams, the emotional consequences of our decisions, the fabric of reality, and the power of an idea. The movie definitely makes you think outside the box. After the first time I watched Inception, I found myself questioning and unsure about what is real and not real in the world. That feeling is a testament to how novel and blown away I was and still am by this film. Nolan also assembles a great cast highlighted by Leonardo DiCaprio (Dom Cobb), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Arthur), Ellen Page (Ariadne), Tom Hardy (Eames), and Michael Caine (Professor Stephen Miles). As we know, Nolan loves using the same actors in different films. As a result, you will find a lot of the same actors in the Dark Knight Trilogy (e.g. Hardy as Bane, Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, etc.). Leonardo DiCaprio is tremendous as the protagonist. In my opinion, Ellen Page is one of the best actresses in show business and is definitely one of my favorite performers on screen. She delivers another stellar performance in Inception. The rest of the supporting characters are very strong and there is great chemistry among the cast. Inception is also a very good action movie. More importantly, I appreciate that the action fits in and makes sense with the concepts of the movie rather than being forced into them. One of the criticisms of this film is that it is too complex to follow. I disagree with this notion. While it makes you think and you need to pay attention, the ideas and the story is laid out in a logical manner. From my perspective, Inception is a near perfect movie. I expected nothing less from Christopher Nolan. When it comes to films, I know he only delivers quality. In Nolan we Trust.\n\nFor my full review, please go to http://rookerville.com/2015/09/21/retro-rehash-inception/",

Only thing is, he steals objects from people's dreams. He assembles teams who go inside people's minds and extract information while they sleep. Pretty cool, right? :)\n\nGod, I wish this movie were THAT easy to explain lol.\n\n It would be epic on that concept alone. But this is Christopher Nolan, and this movie is far more entertaining (and darker) than that.\n\nSee, DiCaprio and Co. aren't tasked to extract; they have the impossible task of INCEPTION (the opposite of EXTRACTION) - which is, to place an idea into a person's mind through their dreams - Without the person knowing! Oh the fun is just starting...\n\nThe further the 'dream team' goes into deep subconscious, the more dangerous things get. Eventually this movie becomes three separate action pieces - as each layer of dreaming takes on its unique set dangers. If that sounds confusing enough, imagine the characters trying to navigate each layer of dream while finishing their mission, maintaining sanity, and literally staying alive. EVERYTHING teeters on precision and exact timing. One false move and they slip into never-ending oblivion.\n\n\nChristopher Nolan is the champion of intelligent action thrillers and this is the possibly the undisputed king of mind-benders. Inception breaks conventional movie rules and creates new ones. Sure, there are other great movies like 'Momento', 'Requiem for a Dream', 'Fight Club' and the original 'Matrix'; movies which warp our perception of reality and deliver a great story...\n\n But Inception destroys all competition as a high concept thriller with nonstop tension and plenty of action. My review can't even do this movie justice. It's like trying to explain a crazy dream. And in the end, are we really sure about DiCaprios fate??? People are still debating the ending to this day!\n\nINCEPTION Christopher Nolan's magnum opus - and quite possible the granddaddy of all mind-bender movies.",

            "content": "A dream, within a dream, within another dream, and a descent into a final dream\u00e2?\u00a6 then limbo. Inception may be a film with literal layers, but for damn sure does it layer itself as an engrossing blockbuster. Inception will temporarily transform your outlook on life and the potential that lies beyond the basic understanding of dreaming. We have been looking upwards for new galaxies and planets, but little do we know there could be a whole new realm, or realms for that matter, fixed into the mind of humans. Directed by the masterful Christopher Nolan, Inception focuses on dreaming, reality, dreams within reality, reality within dreams and the perils of mixing the two together. It is incredible how someone could even conceive of a well-rounded idea and make a global phenomenon of a film by not baffling themselves in the first place. Inception deserves its universal kudos, but those who reject its greatness are either simple-minded or truly have reservations. One cannot deny that Inception is a vision, and that, that vision isn\u00e2??t flawless, but it is a damn good attempt at trying to achieve cinematic perfection.\n \nInception focuses on a professional thief, barred from entering the USA, who infiltrates the subconscious of his targets in order to execute corporate espionage. After failing his latest mission and being on the run, he is offered a chance of redemption and a return home only if he can execute the impossible task that is \u00e2??inception.\u00e2?? In reference to the film, Inception is an implantation of another person\u00e2??s idea into the subconscious of their target, making the idea theirs. As a title, Inception caught some people off-guard not knowing what was at its beginning or establishment point until mid-way through the film! Despite the plot revolving around planting an idea into their target\u00e2??s subconscious, it is all about the process of dreaming that is the film\u00e2??s main point of fascination and when the film addresses the drama about tainting dream with reality, you know that this is Nolan territory. Inception is a far-reaching blockbuster with a heart, but that heart is partially overshadowed by a mixture of tragedy and intricacy.\n \nThe complexity of Inception should be marvelled at with utter appraisal, as the simple matter of envisioning an idea so exceptional is a challenge in itself, let alone creating a fully-fledged feature film. Inception never once gets caught up in its complexity and it spends a substantial amount of time describing how this world can even come to fruition with scattered sequences of illuminating explanations. Inception not only explains itself efficiently, but this is done so well that it makes you think about the alternative world our subconscious could possibly withhold. You will find yourself just mesmerised about the many levels of dreaming states there are and the intricate rules that bound subconscious espionage. Nolan really challenges you to keep up with him; he sets out the structure of the film perfectly and then adds elucidating details to fill each level within the dreaming mechanism. Nevertheless, it is still a lot to take in on first viewing, and if you don\u00e2??t enjoy it, you really have to give it a chance and watch it for a second time, and maybe a third to completely get to grips with its premise. Most negatively, the complexity makes you constantly think about Inception\u00e2??s process, and the fact that you\u00e2??re always thinking about its mental steps, distances yourself from the proceedings therefore your own personal attachment to the film isn\u00e2??t that great.\n \nThrough the backstory of Di Caprio\u00e2??s character, there is a more intimate section to the film\u00e2??s large-scale entertainment. This intimacy appears more dark than what you would have expected as Di Caprio suffers uncontrollable guilt from the death of his wife that whenever he dreams, she appears and damages his plans. Each scene involving Di Caprio\u00e2??s guilt-ridden subconscious acts as a freshening sub-plot to the main proceedings, but this intimacy reveals its dark nucleus and puts a sombre mood over the film because it tragically bites Di Caprio on the ass on several occasions. This profound emotional side is almost secluded because only Di Caprio experiences it full pelt, and sometimes it is too emotional that you don\u00e2??t feel at all sentimental about it. The intricacy of its plot permeates pretty much everything that goes on, reality or (un)reality, and therefore the emotion looks profoundly affecting, but it unfortunately doesn\u00e2??t feel the same way. Despite its tragic gravity, this sub-plot is undoubtedly needed to make it Nolan-esque, because it adds a heart to the film, and in all of Nolan\u00e2??s blockbusters there is always a heart and that is what separates him from the rest of the many directors in Hollywood.\n \nIn terms of Inception\u00e2??s cast, it is predominantly male dominated featuring a group of actors that have been carefully selected to collectively electrify. Leonardo Di Caprio portrays the protagonist Dom Cobb, and with his consistent acting skills, he delivers a solid performance, but again lacks a sense of originality to his acting. Cobb is a meticulous soul, but Di Caprio fails to bring a diversification to his rich character. Joseph Gordon-Levitt\u00e2??s Arthur is involved in some of the best fight scenes in the film but he lacks a depth to his character, which makes him slightly boring. Ellen Page stars as Ariadne, the graduate student turned architect of their dreams. She functions almost as a psychiatrist for Di Caprio and a compass for the audience who like her are trying to comprehend dream sharing, making her a pivotal character who delivers a low-profile performance. Tom Hardy\u00e2??s Eames is the forger of the group and in 2010 the comparatively unknown Hardy shot himself into the Hollywood in-demand acting spectrum telling you all you need to know about his top-notch enactment. Ken Watanabe portrays Saito, the Japanese businessman who employs Cobb with the assurance that he can help him. This is Watanabe\u00e2??s first fully-English film, and unfortunately it shows as he struggles to get his words out and we struggle to understand them. And finally, the freakishly terrifying performance of Cobb\u00e2??s wife Mal, portrayed by Marion Cotillard is perhaps the best acting in the film. Her femme fatale persona is evident through her diversified persona as she can be vulnerable, dangerous, buoyant and distressing all at once. She may be the most depressing character of the film, but boy is she the best actress.\n \nInception already has the profundity of emotion and complex intellect, and it doesn\u00e2??t forget to add the scorching visuals. Seeing as the film deals with dreams, a state of mind where anything is possible, it had to really sell itself through its otherworldly imagery. There are moments where you will be itching to try out the dream-state yourself and at times just flabbergasted by the potential of a world that can truly be yours. In particular, as seen on the film\u00e2??s poster, the physics of the dream-world is non-existent as Ariadne folds half of the city on top of the other half creating a mirror-like image. The filmmakers had to be selective in deciding how they could sell the potential of dreaming and to just fold a city in half is a sight for sore eyes. Hans Zimmer\u00e2??s electronically operatic score serves the visuals justice as it truly unleashes your imagination and almost trances you into a dream-like state.\n \nOn the topic of the very controversial ending in which the totem of Di Caprio that declares the difference between dreaming and reality still spins as the scene fades to black should not be debated about, but instead treasured for adding an ambiguity, or to put it better another dimension to an already complex world. Inception is riddled with depth and as a blockbuster, it truly goes beyond its limits and challenges your understandings.\n\nThe sheer complexity of the subconscious labyrinth created by Christopher Nolan is truly mind-boggling, and if it weren\u00e2??t for its dark intimacy and sometimes convoluted topic, it would succeed on every level.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        8/10",

Resisting encouragement to retire and save what is left of his sanity, Cobb is easily convinced to take one last job. Lured by the idea that this last job could be the key to his mental and emotional freedom, the bonus could\nsee him accomplish the impossible - inception.\n\nAssembling an equally unique team of specialists and constructing the most elaborate deception yet, Cobb attempts to reverse the perfect heist; plant an idea instead of steal it. Inception not deception. Could this be the impossibly perfect crime? Or will Cobb\nlose himself completely?\n\nA twirling top of mind bending information and ideas, this film is a scintillating exploration of dreams, reality and the hairline that separates them. Altering preconceptions and invading the only thing we all believe is simply our own - our mind - this movie's labyrinthine premise extends on writer/director Christopher Nolan's earlier concepts in 2000s, Memento.\n\nThe immersive world of schemes, dreams and dreams within dreams highlights to the extreme just how easy the power of suggestion can completely influence someone's being. The astonishing visuals seemingly overwhelm viewers; however as the film progresses, the chaos and confusion of the multilayered fragmented theory becomes acceptably absorbable. \n\nMeticulously focused on the establishment of films initial premise; the concept of how Cobb not only enters but influences the mind, is clearly defined. Entering whilst in a lightened dream state, Cobb and team can effortlessly morph reality as needed changing time, perspectives and perceptions.\n\nLeaving the dream however is a more complex matter. Piaf's No Regrets is utilised as an alert, a 'music trigger' telling those who have entered the mind that an awakening jolt, a 'kick' is coming to safely remove them. The catch is if anyone misses the kick, they can\neither be trapped in the mind or alternatively die in the outside world.\n\nThe makeup for this movie has been derived from a number of its existential predecessors. Clearly influence by the Matrix trilogy and 1999s eXistenZ, Inception brings a myriad of theories together in an ambitious physiological thriller that sometimes attempts to be a little too clever.\n\nConstantly attempting to establish and prove himself as a dramatic actor, DiCaprio tries his hand at yet another emotionally taxing film and once again missed the mark. Marion Cotillard is heartbreaking as the real emotional backbone, Cobb's wife and Achilles heel, Mal. Joseph Gordon- Levitt does a wonderful job even with some dreadful lines and Juno's Ellen Pages cast disconcertingly appropriate as the whiz-kid architect.\n\nThe verdict: Imagination, dreams, reality; who knows where are the line's drawn? And how to we cross them? Ambition is at war with pertinence in this film and the end result leaves viewers a little cold to its message.\n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 01/10/2010",

            "content": "What to say about Inception? First off, I adore this movie. Not only does it provide exhilarating action but, like most of Nolan's films, it never undermines it's audience. An intelligent blockbuster grounded in realism,Inception is at it's heart a redemption story.\n\nWhat's most impeccable here, beyond the acting and action and special effects and upside Paris and dream sequences and.............film, is how it manages so deftly to delve into psychological themes such as grief, loss and a sense of belonging. It's a truly visionary, astounding piece of filmmaking.\n\nIn terms of the cast, well, lets just say it's stellar. Leonardo DiCaprio is yet again robbed of an oscar in one of his most moving, complex performances that demonstrate what a spectacularly brilliant actor he is. His ability to balance the complexities of the dream world with the pain of Cobb is what defines the whole narrative of Inception. \n\nMarion Cotillard is also the best female lead here (narrowly beating Ellen Page) as the tortured, mentally unstable Mal. Just a little less impressive (just) is Ellen Page, whose performance as the brainy architect is so damn good that its a shame she doesn't work with Nolan more. Furthermore, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Tom Hardy, Ken Wantanabe, Cillian Murphy and Michael Caine fill 0ut the rest of the brilliant cast.\n\nSo much works here that it's hard not to notice problems. Sure, there may be plot holes in terms of the dream sequences and it's debatable realism, but ALL films of this sort do. It's like you can't ever have a time travel movie without plot holes. It's impossible. The same goes for inception, but who cares? It's not like it was directed by Michael Bay or anything.\n\nInception is escapist, blockbuster fare at it's very finest; the pinnacle of creative imagination in modern cinema. Those who do not like inception, whose who criticise this film are the same people who criticise The Shining or Dr. Strangelove (yes, Kubrick films): Morons.",

The film have a strong visual effect and dramatic scene between a dream and reality. The way the film show based on an eye-catching explosion, creative environments and unusual obstacles are very imaginative and creative. Casting choices are excellent based on an acting performance. This is one of the finest sci-fi film I have watched in 2010s and they have nominated for different awards, especially Oscars. \n\nOne actor who caught my attention throughout this film, based on their kick-ass performance, is Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

            "content": "Well hello boys and girls. Christopher Nolan's \"Inception\" is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. It definitely deserves to be in the ranks as the best 100 films of all time and definitely one of the best for the 2000 era. It's such a bizarre, unique and at the same time fascinating exploration into the mind of dreams and accessing a person's information through dream states. DiCaprio as always gives a very explosive performance in this as Dom Cobb, the man who is the most skilled extractor who can access your mind and go into the deepest levels of the dream world. The only problem with his character is that he extradited from the U.S. after his wife played amazingly and creepy by the gorgeous Marion Cotillard, after she kills herself because of reasons I cannot explain in this interview as it is part of the movie, but keeps on showing up in DiCaprio's dream states because he cannot let her go. The movie also stars Joseph Gordon Levitt in his star making role as Arthur DiCaprio's right hand man. Ken Watanabe who I love in everything who is the tourist in DiCaprio's dream state and offers DiCaprio a way back home to American if he completes Watanabe's dream state mission called Inception. Ellen Page from \"Juno\" who is the architect, the person who designs the dream levels. Tom Hardy from \"The Dark Knight Rises\" and \"Lawless\" who plays the forger who impersonates targets in the dream state. Cillian Murphy from \"Batman Begins\" who is the target in the dream state that Watanabe's character wants DiCaprio's character to alter Cillian Murphy's mind so that he can change his position and alter his position as the new power of super energy when his father dies played by the late Pete Postlethwaite. And then there is also the great Tom Berenger from \"Platoon\" and countless other films who is the uncle and godfather of Cillian Murphy's character, who Tom Hardy impersonates in the dream state. And then there is the great and everlasting Michael Caine, who has minor to small cameo roll as DiCaprio's father who taught DiCaprio about the dream state. I really love the fact that Christopher Nolan keep working with all the same actors he works with in the past especially Michael Caine who he has worked with six times already and that includes Chris Nolan's latest feature \"Interstellar.\" I love watching the same actor and director work with each other I just get such a buzz off it like when I watch DeNiro and Scorsese, or DiCaprio and Scorsese for that matter, even Quentin Tarantino and Samuel L. Jackson it's just such an electrifying feel for me\n as a movie buff. There are several layers of the dream state that the cast goes through in this movie in order to alter Cillian Murphy's mind, but I am not going into all that now as it will literally take me for ever to go into, but I will say the one thing that really makes \"Inception\" work besides Chris Nolan's superb direction is Hans Zimmer's haunting and intense score. He literally is my favorite composer as I love the score he does for the Batman movies, Terrence Malick's \"The Thing Red Line,\" the man is truly one of the greatest composers of our time. The one thing that truly shocked me though watching \"Inception\" besides all the crazy twist and turns, especially with the end that still has me pondering about it to this day, is the fact that Christopher Nolan did not get a Best Director Oscar nomination for his work in this movie as this is a movie that could not have been made by any other director other than Nolan as it has him written all over this movie. Just goes to show where the Academy is at today, but I really don't care, I'm over it as for me, Christopher Nolan was the best director when \"Inception\" came out.",

But no, it's just a fantasy movie about dreams. Really, it's no different then The Matrix. That movie was successful because of a fresh concept, style, stoic acting and ground-breaking CGI. And people who told me the plot was complicated must have seen a different movie because everything that's happening is explained like a tutorial cut-scene in a video game. \n\nWhat's great about the movie are the scenes of chaos. Very cool. And the actors. Joseph-Gordon Levitt is my favorite. I don't know if that guy sold his soul to the devil for fame, but I think he has an amazing screen presence.

            "content": "Christopher Nolan has already blessed with his fair share of classics of modern cinema, offering us Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige and the incredible The Dark Knight. With each of these he has proved to be a master of his work, constructing entire worlds for the viewer to lose themselves in entirely. And in his latest work, this is quite literally what he does.\u00a0\n\nInception begins with an idea: what if our subconscious could be accessed and our secrets revealed through the medium of our dreams? What we are given in an answer to this question is one of the most incredible pieces of cinema to hit our screens since Neo decided to take on Agent Smith.\u00a0\n\nDominic Cobb (a fantastic Di Caprio) is a man with a very special area of expertise: steal ideas or secrets from someone's subconscious through the use of shared dreams. However, his troubled past and own subconscious make it increasingly difficult for him to succeed in this profession. In order to solve the problem of his... not quite legal past, he is given one last job to do: inception; planting an idea inside someone's mind, an idea majoritively believed to be impossible. As he and his team go about trying to achieve this, they become increasingly aware that this job might just be known as impossible for a reason.\u00a0\n\nLet's start with the script. It's not quite as playful as the Batman films, so don't expect to be laughing too much; you really won't. The moments of comedy in there are funny, however, so it's not that the comedy falls flat, it's just that comedy isn't as necessary, nor as warranted, in this film. It is, however, as with most Nolan projects, distinctively Nolan. He walks the very, very fine line between the restriction of realism and the streams of uninterrupted dialogue of a Tarantino film beautifully, giving some very quotable lines but being restrained in terms of dialogue in general. Basically, being very clever in terms of what it does and does not say but without flaunting the fact. The intense moments are good and intense and the heartbreaking scenes are nothing short of their mark. It will definitely take a few screenings before a full appreciation for its subtlety and depth is reached, but after watching it once, I don't think anyone would mind a second viewing.\u00a0\n\nNow to the acting. Our main man Di Caprio is aMAZing he is a rock, our anchor in this visual storm which keeps the entire film grounded. This isn't the sort of role, nor the sort of acting, which wins an Oscar. There is no scenery chewing, no intense crying sequences to impress the academy with. But he plays his role so very well. He shows every emotion that Cobb feels, his indecision, his fear, his guilt, without feeling broody or one-dimensional. And the supporting cast is incredible as well, especially Ellen Page playing the newbie to the group outstandingly. Her fear for the program is palpable, as well as her fear of Cobb himself. Marion Cotillard is astonishing in her role. She is as disarming as she is villainess and as lovely yet dark as you would imagine her to be. She is a perfect casting choice for this film and her role is yet another example of why she's incredible. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great as the not-quite-reliable sidekick who seems to be loyal yet unsure of his partner in crime.\u00a0\n\nHanz Zimmer has proved himself, once again, to be a pioneer in the field of score creation. His menacing, dark blasts of primeval sound which make up the films' soundtrack are inspired. They add an extra level of malevolence which takes the film to a entirely new level.\u00a0\n\nNow, onto Mr. Nolan. The only real word for his work in this film is mindblowing, and that word has been bandied about a lot lately, but its true meaning is revealed after watching this film. We go from beautiful, intricately intimate close-ups which perfectly capture the inner workings of our lead's mind, to jaw-dropping wide-scale as buildings crumble into the ocean, avalanches rage down mountain sides, cities fold up on themselves and vans fly off the edge of bridges. It is a truly immense scale upon which Nolan unfolds his drama, but that's to be expected of the Dark Knight visionary. The special effects are flawless; not one frame looks out of place, despite the incredulous nature of the images being displayed. But the incredible thing about the extravagant images and amazing set pieces is the way that Nolan uses them. They are not stunts, nor merely throwaway pieces of eye-candy. Each and every one is used to further his story, expand the universe he is creating or to create a connection between us and the lead. It is a heartbreaking story surrounded by eye-popping images which work together so well. The tension which Nolan creates during the last half of the film is the calibre of a seasoned professional, building it slowly to a level almost unbearable. But the fantastic thing about the film is that Nolan is able to make the entire thing work to create the connection between audience and star which proves so elusive in many lesser filmmakers' work. You're never able to forget why they're going on this journey, nor why Cobb is so determined to make it work, thanks to the fantastic story by Nolan. And with an ending which rivals that of Blade Runner, he sums the entire film up both ambiguously and definitely at once.\u00a0\n\nInception is nothing less than history in motion, we are just lucky enough to be among those who get the first glimpse.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThe horrifying realisation of the occurrences in a hotel room. At once heartbreaking and gut-wrenching.",

But, he is in it and that's what made me decide to watch it - and I don't regret that decision. DiCaprio delivered in Nolan's truly unique film about a man on a mission to reunite with his children, willing to do whatever it takes and in this case that's something quite out of the ordinary to say the least.\n\nThe visuals are simply breathtaking and the whole ride satisfies. I did catch myself getting a tad bored a couple of times during the film but taking into consideration I am not a sci-fi fan in general and prefer a very different type of film, it was good enough. This isn't so much a love it or hate it film, it's more of a like it or dislike it film. I didn't love it - but I liked it!",

            "content": "Either be baked or focused. This movie will send gamma rays through your brain. However, though it is complicated, it is somehow simplistic in its overall structuring. That's just Nolan's stroke of pure genius. That he could have our airhead minds still grounded throughout this 3D chess game and/or Russian nesting doll of dreams. It requires you to give your full undivided attention, or else you will be hopelessly confused. And I love that about Nolan, although there will be some studioheads who will be tearing their hair out. And this is the entire tenor of the backlash which I find to be a public announcement of stupidity but whatever. I must say love the open-endedness of the war-shot ink-blot tester of the final scene which left the entire unanswered question of the movie open to discussion. I laughed giddily and likely in a frightful manner because my dad had told me I was disturbing the audience in the theatre. Is this a dream or is it reality? It becomes a subjective interpretation. Nolan meets with you on a personal level. Are you an optimist or a pessimist is what this ultimately boils down to. And how easily you let emotional reactions and catharsis skew your perceptions. Don't let this dissuade your opinion, you have the freedom to believe what you want. But in case you hadn't noticed, the kids were both the same age and wearing the same clothes after what seems to be several years that have passed by. But the uncertainty of it all is undoubtedly brilliant. Job well done. Nolan is a master of his craft.",
