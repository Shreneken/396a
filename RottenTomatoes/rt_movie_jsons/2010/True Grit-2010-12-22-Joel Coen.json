Its a sobering watch at times, with a variety of characters. Its quite tense, atmospheric and reasonably quiet at times, with the noise of the wind blowing being quite clearly heard. It has a sombre and mysterious feel to it which I quite liked too. Its safe to say there's plenty of time for viewers to contemplate the fate of the various characters, namely Reuben Cogburn (played well by Jeff Bridges) and Mattie Ross.\n\nThis is certainly not in any way a sentimental re-telling of the wild west, so its not quite 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?' territory, although this is a Coen brothers film. As Westerns go, I thought this was quite a good one. Worth a watch.\n\nThe music played isn't especially noticeable but I suppose it does add to the sense of atmosphere during scenes in which we see the main characters trekking across the land. I suppose this is a film about finding out other peoples true characters, putting trust in to others, whether for right or for wrong. I enjoyed it overall.",

            "content": "A first-class western, solidly entertaining and rich in fine craftsmanship. The Coen brothers went back to the harsh terrain of West Texas, where their Oscar-winning masterpiece 'No Country For Old Men' was set and shot, to film this epic quest of justice. It's a decidedly straightforward exercise in genre filmmaking, lacking the quixotic touches Joel and Ethan usually bring to their films. To be honest, were their names not in the credits you could suggest this film was made by any good filmmaker. They pair up with cinematographer Roger Deakins once again, and he shot this beautifully--strikingly lit scenes, winter nights that look as cold as they are, lovely scenic vistas that recall the visual glory of the best movies in this genre. The brothers have stated with persistence that this is not a remake of the 1969 Henry Hathaway film which won John Wayne his Oscar. They stick more closely to the Charles Portis novel both films are based on. The film's most savory asset is the pitch-perfect period dialogue, rich in local color and cadences. The great Jeff Bridges tackles the Duke's role, growling/grumbling his lines, relishing playing drunk and craggy but terrific in suggesting the hard-bitten intelligence his Rooster Cogburn has. Matt Damon has superb timing and makes an intriguing, chatty Texas Ranger all too ready to get defensive about his job title and his home state. Josh Brolin, despite getting third billing, only actually appears on screen for a limited amount of time in the third act. But his chiseled face and menacing eyes instantly suggest the rattlesnake lurking beneath the guise of a slow-witted man. He's so good you wish he had more screen time. Barry Pepper, a superbly sturdy character actor in role after role, shows up as another villainous outlaw thug. But the real standout is Hailee Steinfeld, who is a knockout in her first role. At only 14 she nails the part, able to suggest her character's beyond-her-years wisdom and resourcefulness, her \"true grit\" as it were. But she also conveys the understandable fear a young girl would feel when she walks into a situation and comes to understand she's in over her head. That first-timer Steinfeld more than holds her own with Bridges, Damon and Co. is one of the great movie-going pleasures of the holiday season. The film's meandering pace will test some viewers, but the shocking bursts of violence, the dark, dry sprinkles of wit, and the thrilling confrontations of the third act are enough--along with the performances and direction--to make this one of your best bets for entertainment at the cinema right now",

            "content": "True Grit isn't really a remake as such, but as a more faithful take on the novel. And even if it were a remake, it is one of the better ones if so. While I did like the 1969 very much, although I didn't like Kim Darby, this version does make some improvements, such as the pace and Mattie. But it also has some hindrances, the ending is abrupt, and some of the characters perhaps are not quite as intriguing as they are in the 1969 film, Rooster especially has a more somewhat cantankerous personality there.\n\nLike all the Coen Bros movies, True Grit is beautifully shot, the scenery is stunning and there are some typically quirky moments in the cinematography. The story is compelling, and the dialogue is surprisingly droll which enhances the bleak atmosphere even more. The direction is superb, Carter Burwell's score is wonderfully atmospheric, the pace is more secure here and the final shoot out which stood out in the 1969 film is glorious. The performances are also really good. Jeff Bridges had the great John Wayne to compete with, not an easy feat at all, and while he is a more monotone Rooster Cogburn he is a revelation charisma and performance wise. Matt Damon impresses too, and Hailee Steinfeld is a big improvement on Kim Darby and comes very close to outshining her co-stars.\n\nAll in all, a great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

More importantly, Hailee Steinfeld shines as Mattie Ross, the wise-beyond-her-years, smooth-talking girl who is intent on avenging the murder of her father, outshining Kim Darby from the earlier version.

            "content": "Gripping Western drama from the ever delightful Coen Brothers.\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen's Revisionist Western True Grit (2010) is one of the greatest remakes of all time. The Coen Brothers take you on an American adventure into the deep South for a Western full of disquiet nights and sudden encounters. I loved the adorable and no nonsense lead actress performance from Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross in which she bosses around Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin with equal fervor. Steinfeld is a force to be reckoned with as she's the embodiment of True Grit. Jeff Bridges is phenomenal as the grumbling, alcohol U.S. marshal Rooster Cogburn with his incessant stories, silly complaints, and blunt commentary. His stunning gunshots, final charge, and last ride for decency are incredible moments in cinema.\n\nMatt Damon is hilarious and compelling as Texan ranger LaBoeuf with his extravagant vocabulary and constant whining. He's an excellent foil for Bridges' stubborn Rooster. Josh Brolin cameos as the dim witted murderer Tom Chaney with his foolish gait and idiotic mumbling. Brolin is always funny to me. Barry Pepper is captivating as \"Lucky\" Ned Pepper with his heavy gravitas and total command of his bandit gang. Domhnall Gleeson is sympathetic as the bandit in Pepper's gang called Moon as he begs for help. Ed Lee Corbin's cameo as The Bear Man is just hysterical. Elizabeth Marvel is striking as the older Mattie remembering Rooster.\n\nRoger Deakins' gorgeous cinematography features ultra wide landscape shots that would make John Ford or David Lean proud. Deakins' framing is cool with these strikingly focused medium shots on main characters. Roderick Jaynes' editing is very sharp and quick, giving True Grit a rather steady pace, which is generally unusual for Westerns. True Grit is 110 minutes of laughs and suspense as characters mouth off pithy one liners and remorseless stories written by Joel and Ethan Coen themselves. \n\nThe Coen Brothers adapt Charles Portis' novel with gleeful, gruff, and whimsical writing like all great Coen pictures as well as a reverence for these characters made iconic in the John Wayne film. The Coen Brothers depict the Southern wild West as a kill or be killed frontier with general lawlessness unless paid in blood to bounty hunters, U.S. marshals, or Texas rangers. True Grit shows that it takes both manly toughness and a willful perseverance of character to withstand these God forsaken lands.\n\nCarter Burwell's score is excellent with angelic reimaginings of old folk and country songs. I really like the repeating theme of \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\" like a sweeter version of Robert Mitchum's eerie rendition in The Night of the Hunter. Jess Gonchor's production design cleaves out a wooden rustic look for all the sets, while Nancy Haigh's set decoration has a rugged charm and brutally deserted aesthetic. Mary Zophres' costumes are super stylish with fur coats and leather everything. Cowboys have rarely looked so good on film.\n\nIn all, True Grit is constantly funny, quite charming, and often gripping with suspenseful shootouts and conversations. True Grit is a cool Western from the always entertaining Coen Brothers.",

            "content": "The Coen brothers and the Western genre: at the latest since their Oscar winner No Country For Old Men, we know that this combination fits. In True Grit they take a completely different, almost conventional path. Based on Charles Portis novel of the same name, which spawned the 1969 film classic starring John Wayne, young Mattie Ross sets out to find her father's killer. She is assisted by a marshal who seems to be long past his prime.\n\nThe story focuses on three protagonists. On the one hand, there is the young Mattie Ross, embodied by the then 14-year-old Hailee Steinfeld. Considering that this was Steinfeld's debut in a leading role, she appears almost too experienced and is on an absolute par with her more experienced colleagues. By too experienced it means that one hardly notices her young age. Yes, in those days one probably had to take on more responsibility earlier and shed the infantile behaviour prematurely. The latter is most noticeable when Ross makes her cheeky and disrespectful announcements without regard for the possible consequences. Of course, she is na\u00efve at times, but this is less due to the writing of the character than to Steinfeld's authentic acting. She is particularly fun in combination with her companions Reuben Cogburn and LaBeouf. The former is in none other than Jeff Bridges, who once again delivers a veritable firework of cool. Bridges makes almost every role he plays look easy, even if it's one that's really tailor-made for him. As Cogburn, he is filthy and frustrated on the surface, but doesn't want to let it show in his appearance. When signs appear that he has long since ceased to be what he once was as a marshal, he immediately plunges into stubborn confrontations. He usually leads these against LeBeouf, played by Matt Damon. It often seems that this character was cast just for these arguments, which hurts Damon's presence somewhat. One hardly buys the role of the sovereign and almost ruthless cowboy because he only fits into this kind of role to a limited extent. Much more adequate is the villain part of Josh Brolin, who does exactly his job in very little screentime. \n\nTrue Grit is on the one hand a typical Coen film. Bloody brutality when you least expect it, beautiful images from the wild Western, captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins and peppered with clever and eloquent dialogue. On the other hand, the film is very different from their usual style of making. And this is precisely where the problem lies. The abstruseness of Fargo and No Country For Old Men is missing here. The approach seems almost generic and in its plot the film leans too much on the old version. As a result, it's nothing you haven't seen before multiple times. Still, the Coens put their stamp on the film again, especially with the stellar cast, and make True Grit a very atmospheric film experience. Nice homage to the Wild Western, even if that's about it.",

The scenery of presumably the Ozarks is great, there are not very many main characters, so you can focus in on the important ones.  Jeff Bridges is a great big ornery drunk bear, and comes off like a mean Mark Twain.  I liked his character.  Matt Daemon seemed like a superfluous character - I am not sure what he added to the film.  The bad guys weren't particularly memorable.  Even Josh Brolin didn't particularly stand out.  The Matty character was just annoying as all get out.  I get that she has 'true grit' and all like Bridges, but they couldn't write her any more insufferably.  Also, the characters all talked in a somber, formal tone despite the accents and dialects.  It sounded like they were all in a Shakespearean play, and is sounded awful.",

Hailee Steinfeld is a young girl looking for revenge for her murdered father.  She is a feisty, precocious little girl who is oh-so-lovable because she is a feisty, precocious little girl.  Jeff Bridges is the old, hard-drinking, rough-around-the-edges curmudgeon who is oh-so-lovable because he's an old, hard-drinking, rough-around-the-edges curmudgeon.  The old, curmudgeonly drunkard helps the young girl on her quest for revenge.  Matt Damon shows up in this movie and just utterly sucks -- he is NOT oh-so-lovable because, well, he's Matt Damon.  Josh Brolin is the bad guy and he is probably one of the lamest villains in any movie ever.  The way the characters talk in this film is so annoying -- it reminds me of certain people I've known who love the sounds of their own voices and love listening to themselves yap, yap, yap.  I never cared about the little girl or the old drunk guy with mush mouth or the utterly useless Matt Damon character.  *Spoilers*  Near the end of the movie, after the girl gets bitten by a snake, the old, drunk, mush mouth guy rides a horse to death to try and get the girl to a doctor.  He shoots the horse in its head after it keels over from exhaustion.  Then old, drunk mush mouth guy picks the girl up in his arms and runs to the nearest town to try and save the girl until he too is exhausted.  Then, he pulls out his gun and fires it to signal to the townspeople that he needs assistance.  I swear, when he pulled out that gun, I wanted him to shoot himself in the head. Or, shoot the little girl in the head.  *End Spoilers*  Yeah, I didn't really care about the characters in this movie at all or the little girl's quest for revenge.  The weak, underdeveloped villain didn't do anything for me either.  This movie was mostly just made in America trash.",

When most of cinema is riddled with sequels, or superhero stuff, there was talk of a remake that had floated in. I have known of it, and with the remake that had passed forty years, it gave it some distance from it. Of which we have had a ton of remakes that keep repeating the same stuff over again. Three versions of Spider-man within twenty years. Enough is enough. But this film as I watched it, it was somber. It was breathtaking. Humorous even. It seemed grounded and made the cinema come alive and it was a breath of fresh air. Not only were the leads compelling, that of Jeff Bridges, and Matt Damon paired up but also Haillee Steinfeld just broke it in. Some parts were shocking, other parts were highly questionable, but it all made sense at the end. Not only is it a story about revenge, we also have a story about finding her father one way or another. It didn't tell that, but it was there. All around, this story was superb. I recommend this fully. Out of everything that came out from 2010, it was one of the best films. Highly recommend it. ",

            "content": "The Coen Brothers continue to impress and deliver another film that highlights their versatility as filmmakers. They've made thrillers, comedies, gangster pictures, musicals, dramas, and now a western. There's been a number of interesting westerns over the past 20 years, but they're all typically revisionist westerns, where the genre has been subverted (i.e. \"The Revenant\" \"The Proposition\" \"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\" \"Bond Tomohawk\" \"Django Unchained\" \"The Hateful Eight\" etc.) and have not embraced the more durable tropes and archetypes of the genre. \"Appaloosa\" and \"Open Range\" are the only westerns of the last 20 years I can recall that were of the classic mold and were any quality (all western fans should go out and watch these films immediately if you haven't). The original \"True Grit\" is a classic in the sense that it was a popular film with a memorable performance by John Wayne as the colorful one-eyed lawman Rooster Cogburn, but it's a far cry from being a masterpiece along the lines of the best westerns by Ford, Hawks, or Peckinpah. This was smart on the part of the Coens to take a well known story and character and put their own spin on it. It's harder to remake a masterpiece than it is to remake something mediocre (i.e. remaking \"The Fly\" versus remaking \"Poltergeist\"). As quirky of filmmakers as the Coens are, they have crafted a surprisingly straightforward western, though filled with rich characterizations and a balance of elegance and grittiness. In this retelling Jeff Bridges takes on the iconic role of Rooster Cogburn and Hailee Steinfeld plays Mattie Ross, a young girl who enlists the help of the gruff marshall to find her father's murderer. The Coens are often credited with their visual panache, but they don't get enough respect for their writing. Take this exchange early in the film when Maddie is looking for a marshall to help bring in the man who killer her father:\n\nMATTIE: Who's the best marshal?\n\nSHERIFF: Hmm, I'd have to think on that. Bill Waters is the best tracker. He's part Comanche; it is a pure joy to watch him cut for sign. The meanest is Rooster Cogburn; a pitiless man, double tough. Fear don't enter into his thinking. I'd have to say the fairest is L.T. Quinn; he always brings in his prisoners alive. Now, he might let one slip by evrey now and then, but...\n\nMATTIE Ross: Where would I find this Rooster?\n\nThat exchange perfectly sets up up both Maddie's intentions of what she wants the end result of her manhunt to be and it also informs the audience about the character of Cogburn, even before the audience has met him. As with the original film, the story is mainly a character piece focused on the dynamic between the determined and quite proper Maddie and the gruff jaded Cogburn. Bridges chews the scenery as Cogburn in a way that he hasn't in a film for years. And in the Coen's introduction of the character, Bridges makes the most of their dialogue in a courtroom scene where he describes his bringing a group criminals to justice under cross examination:\n\n\nCOGBURN: I had my glass and we spotted the two boys and their old daddy, Aaron Wharton, down there on the creek bank with some hogs. They'd killed a shoat and was butchering it. They'd built a fire under a wash pot for scalding water.\n\nMR. BARLOW: What did you do?\n\nCOGBURN: Crept down. I announced that we was U.S. marshals and hollered to Aaron that we needed to talk to his boys. He picked up a axe and commenced to cussing us and blackguarding this court.\n\nMR. BARLOW: What did you do then?\n\nCOGBURN: Backed away trying to talk some sense into him. But C.C. edges over by the wash pot behind that steam and picks up a shotgun. Potter seen him but it was too late. C.C. Wharton pulled down on Potter with one barrel and then turned to do the same for me with the other. I shot him and when the old man swung the axe I shot him. Odus lit out and I shot him. Aaron Wharton and C.C. Wharton was dead when they hit the ground but Odus was just winged.\n\nThe Coen's tapped into folksy dialogue in a number of films, but in \"True Grit,\" wether this is authentic language or not, this old west dialogue sounds great and is some of the best I've heard since \"Will Penny\" or Peckinpah. This dialogue also tells us that Cogburn may be a fat old man, but he's also a force to be reckoned with who's quick to violence. Maddie and Cogburn make quite an odd couple on the trail and are also joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, pronounced Le Beef, played to the hilt by by an erudite Matt Damon, who is a perfect foil to the gruff Cogburn. LaBoeuf's know-it-all attitude is also hilariously challenged by the self confident young Maddie. Cogburn's take on the trio is:\n\nCOGBURN: \"I'm a foolish old man who's been drawn into a wild goose chase by a harpie in trousers and a nincompoop.\"\n\nThe Coen's follow the original film's story for the most part, but they bring a richness to the characters and a gritty elegance to their representation of the old west that was missing from the Wayne version. In a time when the traditional western story has become pass\u00e9, the Coens have managed to make it relevant and accessible again for modern audiences. ",

            "content": "Westerns have never been my favorite genre although I do like Hud (1963) and Johnny Guitar (1954). This is a film that causes me not to want to see other films in the genre as it features the hammy performances that the Coen brothers are so fond of and dialogue that seems very pleased with itself. It's a film that's never particularly involving and that wastes talent capable of much greater things. I don't think it's one of the best films of 2010 as it is a highly forgettable film that is painfully dull to watch. When films like Rabbit Hole (2010), Greenberg (2010) and even The Company Men (2010) were released in the same year it seems odd that a film this weak would be showered with so much praise.\n\nIn the old west, Sassy fourteen year old Mattie Ross, Hailee Steinfeld, has her father murdered by Tom Chaney, Josh Brolin, who is under the command of Ned Pepper, Barry Pepper, and has fled Arkansas before she can catch him. She employs bounty hunter Rooster Cogburn, Jeff Bridges, to kill Chaney for her but intends to follow him on his mission. He deceives her and heads off with well meaning Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, Matt Damon, who wants Chaney because he murdered a senator. Cogburn, Laboeuf and Ross eventually team up to try and track down Chaney but face many obstacles to finding him as he is well protected. Eventually our heroes prevail but not without our heroine losing her arm.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with the film is the lack of interesting characters as the female lead is downright dislikable, Cogburn is meant to be folksy but charming and Damon is rather stolid as the third banana. This is an issue I have with most westerns as it can be hard to care about the characters who feel more like empty shells of human beings built to kill than the sort of people you would want to watch for nearly two hours. Their wasn't any in point here because I was frustrated at the sight of the arrogant, smug faced Ross attempting to swindle those around her and with Bridges doing a routine he's done about a million times the novelty had well and truly worn off. In Johnny Guitar I was immediately drawn in by the tough, quick witted Vienna and the inimitable screen presence of the feisty Joan Crawford, there was none of that in this film.\n\nIn addition to this issue the film doesn't present anything in the way of being technically impressive as it lacks the groundbreaking cinematography of a John Ford film and borrows from so many other better films. At least in certain western films that bore the living daylights out of me I can at least appreciate that the shots have been choreographed with great care and there is a certain drama to the landscape that lends itself to cinema. I am usually amazed by the work of the legendary Roger Deakins who did brilliant work on Blade Runner 2049 (2017) and Sid and Nancy (1986) but here he brings the same bland flavor he brought to Fargo (1996) to a story that should feel epic in scope. I want to see sweeping planes and dramatic cliff faces while tall, thin men in cowboy hats cut a sharp against the skyline.\n\nThe multiple acting nominations that this film received at the Academy Awards baffle me with Bridges and Steinfeld both earning undeserved nominations. I don't think that John Wayne's original performance should have contended for an Academy Award but I would argue that Bridges does not hold a candle to him in terms of performance and therefore he should not have a nomination, especially in a year as strong as 2010. Steinfeld is spectacular in The Edge of Seventeen (2016) which she deserved a Best Actress nomination for but here she is intensely annoying as a main character who is meant to be adorable and endearing but leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. Brolin and Barry Pepper give the most colorful, entertaining performances in the film and inject some real fun into a project that takes itself a tad too seriously.\n\nObviously, I would not recommend this to people even if they love westerns because even I, practically foreign to the genre, can see that this film fails on almost all levels.",

The film stars Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie and Jeff Bridges as Marshal Reuben J. Cogburn. \n\nThe acting in the film I found was really good and realistic especially from Jeff Bridges as Marshal Reuben J. Cogburn I personally think that he gave a gritty but loveable portrayal of the character. I also have to say that Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie was a really good casting choice. At this moment in time she is among the best child actors I have seen. The film also co stars Matt Damon as La Boeuf and Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney the bad guy of the story.\n\nThe characters in my opinion were written well and enjoyable to watch especially Marshal Reuben. There were a couple points in the film where there characters were a little too much but I didnt really find that as a problem. \n\nThe cinematography was strong and gave the film some slow but beautiful shots. I especially like one shot were Mattie is inside a cave looking outward. \n\nThe setting like most Coen brother films is very good and gives the era/destination a very realistic feel to it. \n\nThe set design and props in the film is down to the point from the guns to the building design.\n\nThe costume design like the set design is to the point and fits the era extremely well.\n\nThe style of the film like most Coen brother films has a rustic but beautiful colour design.\n\nThe film has some very good special effects especially with the blood and action. The other special effects are good but not as strong as with the action. The film does also have some good CGI along with the special effects. \n\nThe action is pulled off really well from the special effects to the tension. My personal favourite action scene in the film takes place in a cabin with two other people played by Paul Rae and Nicholas Sadler. \n\nThe film I noticed also had some very good sound design from the gun shots to the sound of people hanging. \n\nThe Coen brothers I find are really good with dialogue and using the correct words to use for the era.\n\nSome of the music in the film I found was sometimes to overwhelming which put me off a little bit luckily the film doesnt have too much music.\n\nThe story of the film follows Mattie trying to avenge her fathers murder by hunting down the man who killed him. Along the way she pays the Marshal to help her track down her fathers murderer. \n\nThe film also has some very good comedy especially from Jeff Bridges.\n\nThe film at points also has some strong atmosphere especially toward the end.\n\nThe film surprisingly is also quiet emotnial toward the end.\n\nThere are a couple other things wrong with the film but it doesnt take away too much.\n\nOver all it is a very enjoyable and well made film. So that is why I give it a 8/10 - worth paying for two tickets",

            "content": "Im late to the game in writing this movie review, but I must say that the movie does live up to the hype!\nThe story line moves along in a very straight forward and simplistic style. Its a classic heroes tale in the wild west. SO what makes this movie so damn enthralling?\n\nWell our characters of course! We are immediately pulled in by Haley Seinfeld as Maddie, a strong, stubborn, naively courageous girl on the search for her father's killer. Her educated tongue, her adult-like manner, feel contemporary in a setting far more rigid and outlandish. Our US Marshal Cogburn is a more typical western cowboy; a rough around the edges drunkard who understands the workings on the anarchic west, but who has a soft stop for our outlandish protagonist. Finally, we have our Texas Ranger LaBouef, a man who holds himself to a higher moral, with strong views of the world, others, and himself.\n \nWatching these characters interact feels unimportant. The simplistic nature of the film really hides how much these characters change from start to finish. This is where I think the beauty of the film really shines. The Cohen brothers are masters at making these characters that shouldn't fit in to the wild west, fit right in. For starters, our protagonist is a 14 year old girl! And the viewer is able to accept this fact because we watch Maddi struggle and fight for her right to join on the man hunt. We see a texas ranger with an air of sexism and biggotism, that by the end of the movie, we admire for his moral compass and respect for Maddi. We have a drunkard who makes no attempt at improving himself at all. \n\nThe strangest thing for me was how human our villains were. Maddie shoots Tom Channey off the bat, reminding us that he is no evil villain, he is just a man. We have Channey's team of outlaws treating maddi with a certain level of respect, insinuating there is sore form of hierarchy in the group. Throughout the film, these villains are made out to be the worst of the worst, people willing to kill for no reason at all. In the end, they are shown for what they really are; human beings. Though all of these villains are killed at the end, they felt much less dangerous in reality than they were in stories. \n\n\nIn addition, hidden within this plot is a a weaving of feminist occurrences hat fly under the radar. We have our main character, maddi, successfully kill the villain. This is huge, as our two detectives have been hunting for channey for years. We have our two men by the end of the film, treating our main character with respect and dignity, even as a 14 year old girl. This is a dynamic unseen in most western films other than (name that movie from CIMS101). The magic is in the Cohen Brothers ability to make these hugely feminist and weird themes feel completely normal in the setting of the wild west. \nFinally, we have our ending. The killing of Tom Channey. This victory was IMMEDIATELY brushed over as Maddi falls in a pit and is poisoned by a snake. Suddenly, right when things feel calm and \"peace\" SHOULD be restored, were off to the races! In saving Maddi's life, her success, and the success of the team, is completely overlooked. \nI feel uncertain as to why this decision was made. Why did maddi have to fall in the pit? Why did she have to lose her arm? Why were the three unable to say any form of a good bye? \nIt feels as though Maddi is being punished for what she had done. A possible statement about women attempting to be more in society? She lost an arm, her horse, her friends, and we see that she never marries later on. Could this all have been the result of attempting to do too much? The ending feels very much like thelma and Louise; A powerful victory for women that in the end winds up in defeat. \n\n\nOn a more personal note, I found the dialogue of the film to be a true wonder to listen to. Though Tom Channey speaks with a more barbaric tongue that fits the status quo of the West, LeBouef and Maddi bring educated tongues with them on their journey. Another oddity that the Cohen Brothers seamlessly intertwine in their movie without raising any suspicion.",

I know they were fans of the original, but my experience with them made me believe they were going to take the original and improve it dramatically the Coen Brothers way. Well...they didn't. In fact, this was the most un-Coen Brothers movie I've ever seen. Not to say that is a bad thing, but having just watched the original, I could have not seen this version entirely and not missed anything. Being fans of the original, they clearly wanted to pay homage to the original. In fact, dialogue and setting-wise, it was about a 90% carbon copy of the original, down to the shots, the script and the way the characters were portrayed. The Coen Brothers really didn't do much to put their stamp on the film, except maybe the perfect casting. Aside from very minor differences throughout the film (such as Mattie covering the chimney to smoke out the first couple of ruffians rather than LaBoeuf and having LaBoeuf interact with Ned Pepper the first time instead of Rooster), the only meaningful change in the script is the last 30 minutes. I've never read the book, but the compliments given to this version is that it is more like the book. That must mean the ending. It is very different, and honestly, better than the original. However, anyone could have done this film the way it was done. The Coen Brothers didn't do anything to make this film special, so I'm grading it as an average film. I hope they enjoyed making it more than I enjoyed watching it and I look forward to them returning to their style soon.",

Fortunately, the responsible team in here, is trustworthy and doesn't fail to deliver too. The Coen Brothers; as usual is no short on execution and this time has got appropriate editing on their side. The real game changer of the feature is their smart adaptation of Charles Portis' novel that is not only gripping but sensibly thought-provoking. The background score and the costume design is apt for the tone of the feature. The performance is strong and something that factors a lot in its favour, reason being a great star cast on its side. And addition to that, the performance given by them is appreciative too, especially by the protagonist Jeff Bridges who is supported well enough by Hailee Steinfield, Matt Damon and Josh Brolin (no matter how much runtime he gets in here). The writing is more practical than usual western feature does, as there is too much practicality involved in it that sends out this eerie vulnerable feeling in the audience for the characters. True Grit breeds essential sentiments in its self-created grittiness, but still somehow fails to draw out the anticipated emotion from the screen and the reason would be its perspective.",

The humor, music, sounds; way they speak fit in so well with the tone of the film. This film definitely makes you root for Mattie, Hailee Steinfeld, because she shows such determination in seeking justice for her father who was murdered by Tom Chaney, Josh Brolin. It's not an easy world they live in and the Coen brothers do a remarkable job showing it. The river that Mattie crosses to get to Rooster Cogburn, Jeff Bridges, and LaBoeuf, Matt Damon, is wide and swift.  She was lucky she had her horse, Little Blackie, or she would not have made it. The tree Cogburn makes Mattie climb to cut down a body that was left hanging is tall and the branch sways after she succeeds making her hang on tight so she doesn't fall. It was definitely not how she pictured it would be, but she sticks with it. The humor in it is more random and successful through the timing and editing. Like, the first time Rooster and Mattie are talking, it's a close up of Mattie and all you see is that she is talking to Rooster through a wooden door. After she says, \"You've been at it some time,\" it shows that she's talking to him while he's in an outhouse. Also, when they think LaBeouf is following them, they stop and wait. They make it seem they're waiting 20-30 minutes and some guy wearing bear fur shows up and all Cogburn says is, \"You are not LaBoeuf.\" The score does its job. It's soft where it needs to be. Like, in the scene where LaBoeuf leaves in the night. It's also dramatic when it needs to be. Like, when Chaney says, \"All I need is your silence.\" It's an all-around great movie.",

When we see the cost of living puts a price over everything, some that we prefer to be close to and not have a value after death when sentimental value is more. When we wish to see all those who do us wrong pay the piper in the end.

Enlisting the help of a trigger-happy, drunken U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), she sets out with him---over his objections---to hunt down Chaney. Her father's blood demands that she pursue the criminal into Indian territory and find him before a Texas Ranger named LeBoeuf (Matt Damon) catches him and brings him back to Texas for the murder of another man.\n\nIn this Western filled with gorgeous landscapes and action-packed shootouts, the Coen brothers display a vision of a Wild West that is indeed wild---but also honorable. They went back to Portis' original text and have transformed it into a work of art that stands on its own, apart and different from the 1969 John Wayne classic. Laconic stretches explode with violence and relax with wit and humor on a stage peopled with extraordinary actors, with Bridges as the master. It's a true Western, made for both the genre's connoisseurs and newcomers. The biggest revelation, besides how hokey-yet-winning Damon can be, is Steinfeld. Her role requires the ability to stand up against two award-winning actors and portray a teen who tackles adult responsibilities fully while both grieving and avenging the loss of a parent---true grit, in other words---and she executes perfectly. From start to finish, 'True Grit' plays as it should, and well.",

Surprisingly, I did end up enjoying certain elements of the film, but was overall left dissatisfied.\n\nThe cinematography of the wide open landscapes in the film were pure mastery, and the close detail paid to historical accuracy was much appreciated, but some aspects of the film just missed the mark. Plot holes such as when Mattie Ross rushed into the river with her horse but emerged mysteriously dry left me slightly irritated. I felt that the plot dragged on and on and left me impatiently waiting for the movie to end. I did appreciate the character arch of Laboeuf and Cogburn and how Mattie facilitated/catalyzed their archs. \n\nI'm unsure if this is a valid criticism or not but I also found extremely hard to hear and/or understand the actors words and found myself rewinding the film a lot.\n\nOne aspect of the film I did really enjoy was the musical score. A good musical score for a movie will enthrall you and help the ebb and flow of the plot and this movie's score did exactly that. Without it, it is very probable that I would have fallen asleep watching it.\n\nFor me, watching this film felt a lot like watching a historical documentary of sorts and it did not leave me very fulfilled. In terms of the quest archetype, I felt that it may not be the best movie to represent it well. Because of its ties to western cowboy culture, many may think that it is symbolic of the American quest, but I think a film like The Pursuit of Happyness would have been a much better film to represent this because the quest is much more nuanced.",

LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) is a U.S. Marshall in pursuit of Tom Chaney for various previous crimes and wants in on their pursuit but falls short on his ability to please and differences in approach. Rest is how they fix their differences and accomplish their mission. \n\nA lot rides on making Mattie's character likable and Hailee Steinfeld does an excellent job by showing the stubbornness and innocence associated with her age and maturity to deal with the veteran gunslingers. Jeff Bridges, Josh Brolin and Matt Damon are accomplished and talented actors and there should not have been any doubt about their output. It is gritty than stylish, realistic than audience pleasing (except for the climax). Screenplay and character development are textbook and well executed. The pre-climax where Rooster pushes the horse to its limit is exhilarating and something I have never seen before. But the climax was totally off leaving all we have digested of Mattie's character down the drain. \n\nIf the climax is chopped off, it is a classic winner",

Although the original True Grit shows a simple, hollywood-ized film of a goofy man in a dopy eyepatch, the remake shows us a.... Truly Gritty american story of a man hardened by the frontier and a child hell bent on revenge. The use of scene and silence in this film shows the true loneliness and absolute obscurity that these characters live in, every scene seems unforced, as though we the viewer, have simply been dropped into this living, breathing world that has its own pace and tempo. Entire scenes seem to exist outside of the viewer, and even outside of the characters, as though we happened in on part of a much larger world, giving a very real sense of the life around them. The use of proper grammar takes what would have been nothing but pure dirt digging badassery, and turns it into a shakespearean play, the narrations flowing like beautiful poems, playing over images of the true west; unforgiving, hard, and quite gritty (as the name would imply). This is only further reinforced by the top tier performance of every actor in this film. I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who is into Quentin Tarantino films, as many of the scenes are driven by speech. However, it certianly does not skimp on the action. This film still remains one of my favorite westerns",

I rarely watch Westerns these days as they don't seem to make them in the present day. When seeing True Grit, I was excited to see it as its from the Coen Brothers, and as their first Western film, it's honestly one of the best Western films that I've seen. Newcomer Hailee Steinfeld is terrific in it that I'm glad that she got accolades for it, even though it's odd that she got nominated for Best Supporting Actress as she's the main character here. Jeff Bridges is very intimidating when he needs to be, but can still get behind by being a likable guy. The minor characters are really good like the Bear guy, the bank guy, and some others. Matt Damon is good in it, which some people have problems with him like for the fact that he kind of sticks out like a sore thumb, and maybe he does, but the character that he plays, is from the Texas Rangers, so that makes sense why he probably seem out of place for some viewers that has issues with Matt Damon being in this movie. The action scenes were entertaining to watch, and the chemistry between Rooster and Mattie are interesting and it gives out some funny moments. The writing by the Coen Brothers is very well written, and the direction by them is very well done with some great shots of it. I heard that the ending is different from the original, and I think it's for the best because of what the main character's determination is. The Coen Brother's True Grit is a fantastic movie that has a good story, and memorable characters that make this remake once in a lifetime ordeal.",

When her father is murdered by a cowardly low life, 14 year old Maddie goes on the hunt for the man responsible, using her intelligence and determination to enlist the help of a US marshal and Texan ranger, to aid her cause. Its a wonderfully simple concept, crafted so expertly and built upon in so many ways, its truly engaging to witness. True Grit, comes straight out the gate wearing its tone firmly on its sleeves, its brilliant blend of humor and mature content, make it such a pleasure to watch, feeling invigorating and never as simple as it ultimately is. With a stellar cast in Bridges, Damon and Brolin, Hallie Steinfeld comes hurtling on screen with a performance that matches the Hollywood heavyweights. The script is dialogue heavy, with its use of eloquent language always prominent, however the young actor, never flinches or falters, delivering line after line flawlessly and expertly and crafting a performance that grips from start to finish. Each actor takes on their roles in such a brilliant fashion, all of them stand out with their own character traits, while managing to never outshine each other, its a brilliant piece of ensemble work that holds a strong script high. Visually the best cinematographer in town, Roger Deakins, yet again provides a flawless and breath taking vision of the wild west, his use of lighting is inventive and powerful and his ability to frame harrowing images, in such a unique and stand out fashion is beyond credit. True Grit paces itself perfectly, galloping along at a continual pace throughout, it introduces characters at exactly the right time, allows everyone room to flourish and revels in its performances and script writing stature. It looks glorious, it sounds glorious and it is presented in expert fashion. Maybe not as genre defining or daring as other westerns, True Grit takes a simple concept and executes it to perfection.",

Bridges character had a frustrating gargling voice that made him hard to understand and while seeing the purpose of his tone, it hurt the film. Josh Brolin had an interesting character, but was on screen for less than maybe ten minutes so his talent was wasted. Nothing big or exciting happens and the \"bad guys\" weren't so bad and did not put up a fight. My final and biggest complaint is Hailee Steinfeld. I disagree that she did a great job. She had horribly annoying dialogue that made me want to shoot her for the men and her performance seemed very forced. In all this film let me down in a big way and I sadly do not recommend it.

            "content": "I will start by saying that the Western genre is not a favourite of mine. Bar a few notable exceptions, they are not what I sit and wait for as I would the next superhero film. Films by the Coen brothers, however, are what I sit and wait for year round. So despite my initial surprise at their latest choice of subject, I waited eagerly for the film to arrive. First there was that inspired poster, then the captivating trailers, then finally it hit the theatres. And while the story is adapted from Charles Portis' novel, with already created characters and a very strict set of rules in terms of speech patterns, True Grit comes off feeling entirely original, fresh and, most importantly, unmistakably Coen.\u00a0\n\nWhen Mattie Ross' (Hailee Steinfeld) father is murdered by a man named Tom Chane (Josh Brolin) she embarks on a \"great adventure\" to track him down and avenge her papa's death. However, being only 14 years old, she decides to enlist some help in the form of Marshall Reuben 'Rooster' Cogburn (Jeff Bridges).\u00a0\n\nThe Coens have already proven themselves to be extremely adept at recreating existing stories to make films, whether it's real life stories like Fargo or books like No Country for Old Men, always with fantastic results. Here they have managed to wring out every single Coen-esque aspect from Portis' novel, whether it's a dentist in a bear suit or a man who speaks in animal sounds. At the same time, they also create indelible characters in Mattie and Rooster, she a stubborn 14 year old who witnesses first-hand the depraved violence and ruthlessness which man is capable of, he an old hand who is all but desensitized to everything that the world has to offer. The script is fantastic. Blending humour and drama is something that the Coen's have proved themselves in time and time again, and here is no different. And for those who thought that The Social Network was the only movie with some speedy dialogue, try throwing Old English into the mix.\u00a0\n\nThe actors have the hard task of living up to such a script, and they do so perfectly. Jeff Bridges is simply amazing as the mumbling Rooster, feeling no need to fill John Wayne's shoes, creating his own character and never once straying from it. He's larger than life and Bridges fills him with nuance. Whether he's telling his life story to pass the time or having a drunken shooting contest, he's great fun to watch. Matt Damon's LaBeouf, though not as likeable as Bridge's Rooster is also a fascinating character. His different way of doing things and annoying habit of, well, talking may not make him a favourite in anyone's eyes, but Damon plays him with sincerity and confidence, holding his own against Bridges at every turn. But the revelation here is the much talked about performance by Hailee Steinfeld. People may have heard enough about how fantastic she is by now, but she is simply amazing. She is able to capture the strength and fire of Mattie as well as her innocence and naivety, and cope with the script she's been dealt which is a feat in itself. Even better is the chemistry which all three of these characters find, especially the friendship between Rooster and Mattie as he recognises the fire and courage in her and she sees the soul in him. The supporting characters such as Tom Chane and Ned Pepper are not overlooked either, each of them fleshed out in a matter of minutes with a fantastic script.\u00a0\n\nWhat the Coen brothers have done, and what many other directors have tried to do, is completely reinvigorate the wild west by making it seem completely fresh while paying attention to the conventions of the genre itself, with help from an incredible cinematographer in Roger Deakins. And where else are you going to see Jeff Bridges with a revolver in each hand riding a horse with reins between his teeth?\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThe climacitic\"One eyed fat man\" scene.

I love the Story and heard that this is a reboot from the true grit movie starring the most iconic western Hollywood actor of all time John Wayne. I've never watched the original but by the looks of this movie how is the original going to top this. The script is the best , it feels like a original old western movie, I don't know why Hollywood doesn't make western movies anymore, like it used to be but now it is time for comic book movies.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nIt is rare for a film that was previously cherished to lose some of its affection, as usually I am the type who finds the beauty of those that was previously misunderstood. True Grit in my eyes before was a near perfect film, but I think I felt that way during the time because of my then limited knowledge of the Western genre and usually the first few films that one sees from the genre would become the reference point for all other films. Now in my second viewing, I was able to find certain flaws that were covered by its sweeping atmosphere and hard-edged characters, leaving me a bit underwhelmed as compared to the directors' greater films; No Country For Old Men and Fargo.\n\nIn a Coen brothers film, it is common to find well explored themes, some recurring, and it is these cinematic depths that allows their stories valuable and stand out. True Grit is not as thematically dense as the other films that I mentioned earlier, and because of this, I wasn't able to gain that sense of satisfaction from this tale of revenge and self-worth. I felt the film did not expose enough of the characters or the story for me to chew on long after the film has ended; once True Grit ended, so was my attention. Though, the film is not completely empty in its themes as obviously the ideas of revenge and justice are in display, along with moments that touches on the male ego and how that ultimately affects their purpose and values. But like I said, the film doesn't do enough with it for me to heavily contemplate on. I also had a problem with the film's primary antagonist Tom Chaney who did not come off as threatening as I expected him to be and his purpose towards the deeper aspects of the film felt underdeveloped.\n\nIn saying all these flaws, it may seem unreasonable for my score to be so generous, but this was one of the rare times where its superficial elements were strong enough for me to be swept away and produce a worthwhile experience. True, the film lacked the intelligence that was expected from a Coen brothers film but it makes up for it with an immersive atmosphere of its time period; dazzling me right down to the costumes and props. Roger Deakins, the film's director of photography captures the environment in such a natural way that at times I forget that it was a period piece. There have been a few Western films in recent years that match the scope and detail that True Grit has but none of them have completely wrapped me, as they always left me in awareness of the fact that I am viewing it from a screen. True Grit does not over-emphasise the elements of its genre, instead it uses it to shape the physical qualities of its characters; keeping our attention on them at all times. The film also features interesting and humorous dialogue, a trademark of the brothers, and through that it keeps its audience engaged, even during the quieter moments.\n\nThe cherry on top of True Grit's visual beauty is the gorgeous musical score by Carter Burwell, driven by the soft and tender sounds of his piano. It created a sense of sadness to the world that these characters are in, and possibly connected to the pitiful demons that lurk beneath its male individuals. It doesn't at all self-gratifying like a classic Western film and understands its intentions are on the characters, not beyond it.\n\nTrue Grit features fine performances from Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld, featuring wonderful chemistry, particularly during the earlier areas of the film. Bridges brings a similar feel to his character like the one in The Big Lebowski, but with a slurring lower register, and a much dirtier physical appearance. One can see Bridges is having fun here but stays committed to the role, ensuring that he is still taken seriously regardless of his sometimes comedic remarks. Steinfeld stood out due to her firm attitude and articulate speech; it allows her to create a sense of dominance towards her male companions, forcing us to see beyond her childlike physicality. Matt Damon is also a prominent cast member in this but I felt his character was not as outstanding, playing a man that is \"appropriate\" to the world around him. The same statement could go to Josh Brolin and his performance, delivering that is less satisfying to those playing the central protagonist; sometimes leaving me in a blank when retrospectively recalling his role in the film.\n\nTrue Grit could have been more ambitious in its themes and ideas but this flaw does not prevent the film from being an entertaining and immersive watch. Simply view this, sit back and let the visuals and music take you in a world that has long passed.",

I know they were fans of the original, but my experience with them made me believe they were going to take the original and improve it dramatically the Coen Brothers way.  Well...they didn't.  In fact, this was the most un-Coen Brothers movie I've ever seen.  Not to say that is a bad thing, but having just watched the original, I could have not seen this version entirely and not missed anything.  Being fans of the original, they clearly wanted to pay homage to the original.  In fact, dialogue and setting-wise, it was about a 90% carbon copy of the original, down to the shots, the script and the way the characters were portrayed.  The Coen Brothers really didn't do much to put their stamp on the film, except maybe the perfect casting.  Aside from very minor differences throughout the film (such as Mattie covering the chimney to smoke out the first couple of ruffians rather than LaBoeuf and having LaBoeuf interact with Ned Pepper the first time instead of Rooster), the only meaningful change in the script is the last 30 minutes.  I've never read the book, but the compliments given to this version is that it is more like the book.  That must mean the ending.  It is very different, and honestly, better than the original.  However, anyone could have done this film the way it was done.  The Coen Brothers didn't do anything to make this film special, so I'm grading it as an average film.  I hope they enjoyed making it more than I enjoyed watching it and I look forward to them returning to their style soon.",

            "content": "True Grit is the 2010 remake of the classic John Wayne western directed by the Coen brothers.  I haven't seen the original film so I won't be comparing the two and just judge this as its own piece.  I haven't seen too many Coen brother movies, but the ones I have I've enjoyed.  I love No Country For Old Men.  In fact, it's one of my favorite films.  I like The Big Lebowski but I don't adore it like most people seem to.  I've also seen this film obviously and I'll say this is a really good one.  There will be minor spoilers so be warned.  \nThe story follows a teenager named Mattie Ross.  One night her father was killed.  Mattie seeks to track down his killer with the help of a U.S. marshal named Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and another lawman named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon).  \nThe characters are fun and quite interesting.  Besides Matt Damon's character these aren't your typical band of heroes in a western.  Mattie is very cold, intelligent, and very determined which is very rare in a child character in a film like this.  Back in the Wild West women didn't really go on manhunts or acted this way so it's probably not that realistic.  However, at least it's different, and it's much better than having your typical whiny kid around that's just here to get kidnapped, whine, or try to be funny.  She can get annoying at times with that attitude though which brought the film down a bit for me since she's the lead, but it doesn't ruin her character.  Plus, the actress, Hailee Steinfeld does a great job acting-wise.  \nRooster is an old drunk who's basically given-up on everything and just waists away.  He's a lost soul who cares nothing about his actions but does try to do the right thing on occasion.  He's not really heroic but still sympathetic enough as well as fun to watch.  I'm not a big Matt Damon fan but I think this is one of his better roles.  It's fun to see these characters interact as they go on their adventure.\nThe film looks beautiful as well.  The look of the Wild West and the countryside is just stunning.  The action scenes are pretty fun too though there aren't that many.  The music is fine.  It's nothing great but it gets the job done.  The acting is also on-point.  Everyone gives a great performance especially Jeff Bridges.    \nI especially love the ending.  This mainly because it's not an ending we typically see in these types of movies.  It's not a downer ending but it's not happy either.  It's years later and we see that Mattie's vengefulness has led to her feeling very lonely and empty.  We also find out that Rooster has died in a very sad way.  It wasn't an honorable death at all.\nOverall, True Grit is a great as a western and as a film in general.  The film looks, fantastic, has fun characters, has a stellar cast that gives great performances, and has a different but good ending.  No Country For Old Men is still my favorite Coen brothers movie so far, but this is a close second.",

With high octane fights and acting not too bad to say this is made up with lots of CGI, The producers of this film really don't do a bad job in getting it all together and one of them executive producers is none other than Steven Spielberg. \n\nThe film itself is a good length and although it made me feel slightly sleepy at times, it still conjures up good things. Hugh Jackman is OK as the main character Charlie and his son played by Dakota Goyo is actually well cast, as Goyo seems to fit well with the story and he could be a young actor to look out for in the future. Evangeline Lilly is charming as ever and although not at her full potential as an actor here, she still brings a certain air of calm headed coolness and seems a refreshingly different pace in the film.\n\nShawn Levy directs this and his eye is not immediately on point it can seem and parts can be a little, say dodgy with too much action in certain parts but then none at all for a good length of time. I felt the heavy metal score placed down on this film was not one that drew me into the fighting, it only caused me to want the fight to end but I can see for some that they would find it more exhilarating than me. It is written well and the two guys who do the screenplay(Dan Gilroy and Jeremy Leven) don't hurt the movie but don't provide any assistance to the already seen type of plot.\n\nThe effects are one thing that stand out in this movie and on reflection they are very nice and it's no wonder it got an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. It may seem or feel that the effects could over shadow the true feeling in the film but I felt any emotion the characters show is shown well enough through all the big budget stuff. It's not over dramatic storytelling(although the ending without spoiling is well, cheesy cheesy and more cheese), you'll notice if you see how the movie starts slow but really picks up a pace and although not rushing into it's ending, seems to want to finish without a bang.\n\nMy review may seem as if I did not enjoy this, or maybe even like I liked this much more than I did but in truth I found it kind of OK and although not quite Good, still acceptable in the vast CGI action movie catalogue, that seems to get bigger every year. I gave it a C- and that may seem harsh and I know for sure that some people will read this and completely disagree with what I have been saying but you have to like action to like this, not just Sci-Fi story telling, you have to like straight all out fighting. \n\nThe film has true heart there is no doubt, one last thing I want to say about this is that you can feel for those involved and Hugh Jackman although maybe not at his absolute best, still draws you in. Give it a go even if you don't enjoy all out action because it may just surprise you how much you actually liked it, not easy to like but possible and it is wrong to say only a certain demographic would enjoy this.",

Damon plays his best character yet and is equally as unforgettable. Brolin, while not in the film for long is less than at his best. However Pepper is excellent as Lucky Ned. Together the cast makes up an excellent group that tells a fun, exciting, and not soon forgotten story.

            "content": "\"People do not give it credence that a young girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's blood. But it did happen.\"\n\nTrue Grit is a flawed yet highly entertaining piece of cinema, written and directed by the impressive hands of Ethan and Joel Coen. It's a Western with a straight-forwardness which will confuse many; it doesn't seek to provide much commentary or cyncism. It wishes to tell its story with its heartfelt poignancy and character-centric pacing. Whilst uneven in the way that it drifts between sequences, it is undeniably affecting and well-paced, and is perhaps one of the strongest Coen brothers films in terms of sheer acting prowess. This is a film which is certainly worthy of acclaim, but one must be prepared to accept it's multitude of issues.\n\nTrue Grit centres around Maddie; a young 14 year old girl, played by Hailee Steinfeld, whose father has recently been killed by a man known as Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Utilizing the help of a drunkard U.S Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and a Texan Ranger (Matt Damon) named LaBoeuf, Maddie treks across the Wild West, seeking revenge against the man who murdered her father.\n\nA simple but heartfelt story is what makes True Grit ultimately so undeniably satisfying but overtly saddening and potent. It's a brilliantly acted, well shot picture, that captures the heart and soul of the Wild West, and completely immerses the viewer in the landscape and rugged terrain. The fantastic performances from Bridges and Steinfeld primarily are what allow the audience member to become engrossed in their plights, both of them aptly fitting into their roles. The writing, also from the Coen brothers, isn't particularly impressive, but does get possibly the most important factor of the film pitch-perfect, and that is the relationship between the quick-witted and highly intelligent Maddie, and the loathsome, tough and rough Cogburn, who quickly form a bond between them that is instantaneously relatable and likable. This emotional connection they form resonates most towards the conclusion, when certain events render their friendship vital to each others survival; the Coen brothers layer on the sentiment and get the viewer suitably transfixed by these characters, before delivering multiple emotional gut-punches towards the closing moments of the picture.\n\nThe usual comedy from the Coen brothers is not lost, the film engaging in numerous hilarious situations which garner praise from myself. Unfortunately, the film does sport numerous faults in terms of its pacing, and also possesses an irritating and lacking score from Carter Burwell which contains little more than a primary theme that is repeated constantly for the duration of the picture (a primary theme which doesn't seem to suit many of the scenes in which it is implemented within). The film seems to jump from one sequence to the next, and lacks substance in-between. Whilst you do become connected with the two protagonists, the film is too intent on letting the main events play out, and it doesn't feel as if there is any down time in between.\n\nNevertheless, True Grit is a competent film; it doesn't do much, or leave a huge impression on the viewer. It has numerous faults, and lacks strength in its plot and pacing; but what it lacks in these areas it makes up for in character and sheer dialogue alone. The action scenes are often slightly anti-climatic but nevertheless thrilling; the locations are stunning; the cinematography fantastic. It's a strong, adequate film that will undoubtedly keep many a viewer entertained.\n\n\"That didn't pan out.\"",

Back in 1969 there was film of this story which is based on this very novel which means this is a remake and i hate remakes. But in this modern time with all the great technology they decided to remake this anyway. Since they cut off a few scenes that were from the original it was very disappointing but they had some funny quotes and some blood which did make the film seem a little better. If they had stuck with the same scenes as last time and had those funny quotes and blood that would have been more satisfying. Director siblings Joel Coen and Ethan Coen have made yet another modern classic with True Grit, the best Western since Unforgiven. The Coens' film is based more on the Charles Portis novel than on the 1969 screen adaptation of True Grit, which won John Wayne the Academy Award for Best Actor.\n\nThe story follows Mattie Ross (newcomer Hailee Steinfeld), a fourteen-year-old girl out to avenge her father's muder by tracking down his killer, cowardly outlaw Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Chaney has fled into the Indian Territory, a lawless region where desperadoes believe they can hide from the law. Shrewdly regaining money owed to her father, Mattie quickly establishes herself as a force to be reckoned with despite her youth.\n\nShe hires a hard-drinking mankiller of a U.S. Marshal named Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges, the Dude succeeding the Duke), to help her hunt down Chaney. But another man is also after Chaney, a proud Texas Ranger with a penchant for bragging named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon). Rooster and LaBoeuf join forces to find and capture Chaney, with the implacable Mattie proving her own true grit by going along with them on their dangerous journey.\n\n\nMore True Grit Videos\n\n\nJust when you thought the Coens had made their career best with the neo-Western No Country for Old Men they make this gem. True Grit is one of the top films of 2010, and can now be added to the ranks of Best Picture Oscar front runners such as Inception, The Social Network, The King's Speech and 127 Hours.\n\nBeautifully directed by the Coens and strikingly shot by Roger Deakins, True Grit boasts a fantastic script (also by the Coens) which, like Deadwood, isn't afraid to have its characters speak in language that is both familiarly twangy to fans of the genre and almost Shakespearean in its formality and strangeness to the modern ear. And no cast member is saddled with more of that challenging dialogue (or nails it better) than Hailee Steinfeld.\n\nSteinfeld is a revelation here. Not since Ellen Page burst onto the scene in Hard Candy has a young actress made such a smashing debut. Steinfeld simply owns the screen from her very first scene, fast establishing herself as a commanding presence to both the other characters and the viewer. She is smart, tough, vulnerable, funny and has range. It will be very intriguing to see where Steinfeld goes from here professionally as she'll most likely earn an Oscar nomination for her performance.\n\n\n- Paramount\n\nJeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld star in True Grit.\n\nSteinfeld has plenty of high-caliber veterans to play off of here, all of whom are great as well. Bridges is equally riveting as Cogburn, who is almost as self-abusive, funny and lazy as The Dude, but with a fearlessness and violent streak. Colin Firth will have some serious competition in this year's Best Actor race from Bridges, who could likely win his second one in as many years (a win that would be ironic and touching given that Wayne also won for playing Rooster). Bridges is fully his own Old West badass here, with no cute winks or nods to The Duke in his grizzled portrayal.\n\nMatt Damon finds the humor in LaBoeuf (pronounced \"LaBeef\" and not like the Transformers actor), a man so proud of being a Texas Ranger that he'll gladly remind people of it at every opportunity. But he's also a fiercely determined lawman in his own right, proving as able (if not more so) than the inebriated, sketchy Rooster. (I have to wonder if Damon's Texas accent and portrayal of the vain LaBoeuf isn't a nod to his very accurate imitation of Matthew McConaughey.)\n\n\n- Paramount\n\nClick for more images from True Grit.\n\nBrolin is certainly better served in this Western than he was in Jonah Hex, and finds both the humor and repellent qualities in his weasely bandit. Barry Pepper (almost unrecognizable behind disfiguring makeup) plays a small but compelling role as outlaw leader Lucky Ned Pepper, the boss of the gang Chaney has fallen in with. Ned has a sense of frontier honor about him, something Chaney most certainly does not. Although Robert Duvall played the role in the original film, Pepper is almost reminiscent at times here of the great character actor Harry Dean Stanton.\n\nMy only nitpick about True Grit -- seriously, a nitpick -- is the awkward and very phony-looking visual effect background that's used during a climactic nighttime horse ride that Rooster and Mattie make. It's the film's one false note, the only thing that pulls you out of this otherwise immaculately recreated period and reminds you that you're watching a movie. Otherwise, True Grit -- with its stellar writing, direction, performances, cinematography, and score by Carter Burwell -- is truly great. This is why i GIVE TRUE GRIT a 4.5 out of 5",

I've also come to the realization that Matt Damon can carry off just about any role he wants (although that spanking scene made me uncomfortable) On that note I imagine PETA was fairly involved here -jeez that last scene with the horse!  10.13\n\n\"Coen brothers remake of John Wayne classic; an alcoholic US marshal (Jeff Bridges) and an independent minded 14 yr old girl track down her fathers killer with the help of a Texas ranger (Matt Damon)\"",

The best part  was the soundtrack. It had me humming a long. Not literally. I just really enjoyed the choice of music and the usage of it was amazing. It really brought out the story and the feel of the era. The only downfall was Matt Damon's performance, at times he could be quite annoying but overall performances by everyone was excellent. It's one of the best this year.\n\nwww.what-to-watch.com",

I was a little disappointed that there wasn't some from of homage to the song. But that's as far as my disappointment goes. Of course its not exactly the Coen brother's finest hour, but its still a great movie that has great performances and sleek plot. Hailee Steinfeld was the standout, being able to hold her own against Matt Damon and the thespian Jeff Bridges. A must watch for everyone. 7/10",
