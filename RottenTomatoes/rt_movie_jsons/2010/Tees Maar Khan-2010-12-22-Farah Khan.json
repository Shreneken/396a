            "content": "My love for Farah Didi knew no bounds after watching Tees Maar khan:\nSome very obvious reasons:\nCharacter\n1. The Characters can't be more appealing, from Tees maar Khan alias Tabreez Mishra who is a con artist with magical powers to Aanya, a good for nothing wannabe actress and acrobat dancer to Johri Brothers, two twins who can't be separated from each other to a Sasta Leo Caprio without any acting skills who is obsessed for an Oscar; they all transcend boundaries of great character.\nStoryline\n2. If there is one movie that rightfully comes close to enigma and beautiful portrayal of this movie, then it has to be inception. The plot of the film is unbelievable; I mean literally unbelievable.   Managing to develop a con artist who is blessed with such magical powers that he stole watches and jewelry the very moment he was born. And leaving no stones unturned in making us believe that a whole village can be fooled to do a robbery of a train full of antiques.\n\n3.Dialogues \nDialogues were up there with Shashank Redemption, to give you a taste of few:\n\"Textbook se copy karta hua student and tess maaar khan ke bheje se nikla hua plan kabbi fail nahi hota.\"\n\n'Tube se nikla hua toothpaste or tees maar khan ke die hue jubban kabhi wapis n jaati'\n\n\"Kuute ke muu se haddi or tees maar khan ke haatho se gaadi dono cheene Bakar h\"\n\nAnd my personal favorite was \nBoss, dhoop aa raha hai.... Accha? Jao Suraj ko bolo thoda baju me hat neko!\" \n\n4. Cameo\nIf there was any scope of brilliance left in the movie, it was filled by Sallu Bhai's cameo in 'Wallah re wallah.\"\n\nSome  not very obvious reasons to love Farah Didi\n1. So, Bollywood has the habit of subtly glorifying Racism, but Farah Didi managed to do it so openly without any repercussions, which is commendable.\nIn one scene while referring to a criminal the dialogue says, \" Ismail koyle se kaala h, ya koyla ismail se kala\" and \"Ismail ke pass do hatyar h, ek. Raat ka andhera, dusra Ismail ka smile.\"\n\n2. In one dialogue which is repeated more than once Tess Maar khan says \"Tawaif ki lutti izzat bachana; aur tees maar khan ko qaid karna; dono bekaar hai\" and you can't expect anything more from the movie now.\n\n3. In one scene Farah didi wasn't able to find a white man to play a Britisher's role in her film, so she takes the help of a person with albino and stuffs bubble gum in his mouth as a language barrier again without any consequences. \n\nConclusion\nThis is one such movie that should be kept in a museum to tell people that this is a quintessential masterpiece and this is the only movie one should set as a standard for a perfect movie.",

Anil Kapoor and Salman Khan make a special appearances in the film as well.\r\n\r\nTees Maar Khan revolves around an overconfident conman named Tabrez Khan (Akshay Kumar) who has been a criminal from birth. (Yeah you read that correctly, he stole the doctor's watch and nurse's chain on the birthing table) Tabrez is a thief who is capable of opening any lock in the world, be it on a flying plane or a running train. The story revolves around how he undertakes a job to rob a train containing millions of dollars worth in precious antiques. Tabrez's love interest is played by Katrina Kaif as Anya Khan who nails her bimbotic airhead role to perfection.\r\n\r\nNot my cup of tea. It all looked like a lot of goofing around was captured in a camera and eventually put together as a movie. One of my friends took part in a Bollywood Competition and Sheila Ki Jawani was her talent piece so truth be told I just watched this movie for the song. (and Katrina oozes sensuousness in the video.)",
