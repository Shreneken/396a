            "content": "Like the title says, this movie sucks, and not in a nice way, like on the straw of a chocolate thick shake. It sucked like a dental assistant when you are getting a filing. Vampires Suck has a completely unfunny script that relies on endless unfunny attempts at physical humour and a few scenes copied straight out of old spoof movies like Police Squad. I didn't get one genuine laugh out of the whole movie. Save your electricity give this film a miss.",
