    "summary": "For Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), boxing is a family affair. His tough-as-nails mother is his manager. His half-brother, Dicky (Christian Bale), once a promising boxer himself, is his very unreliable trainer. Despite Micky's hard work, he is losing and, when the latest fight nearly kills him, he follows his girlfriend's advice and splits from the family. Then Micky becomes a contender for the world title and he -- and his family -- earns a shot at redemption.",

The characters however are very unlikable and for me they weren't people I could connect with or care about. The film is boring at first and I thought about calling it quits, but after the first 45 minutes the story starts to get interesting and it managed to grab my attention enough to finish it. If you're a fan of the real life brothers or enjoy boxing movies you may like this, otherwise if you're a casual viewer like me it's probably worth a skip.",

            "content": "\"The Fighter\" (2010) is a biographical drama/sport movie directed by David O. Russell and starring Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, and Amy Adams. The film tells the story of boxer Micky Ward (Wahlberg) and his relationship with his half-brother and trainer Dicky Eklund (Bale), who is also a former boxer and a drug addict.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of the film is the acting. Mark Wahlberg delivers a solid performance as Micky Ward, portraying him as a determined and hard-working athlete who is constantly trying to improve. Christian Bale, on the other hand, steals the show with his incredible portrayal of Dicky Eklund. Bale captures the nuances of his character's addiction and erratic behavior, making the audience feel both empathy and frustration towards him. Amy Adams also delivers a powerful performance as Micky's girlfriend, Charlene, adding depth and complexity to her character.\n\nThe plot of \"The Fighter\" is engaging and well-paced, with a good balance between the drama of Micky and Dicky's personal lives and the intensity of their boxing matches. The film also does an excellent job of exploring the complexities of family relationships, particularly between Micky and Dicky, who have a complicated and often strained bond. The screenplay is well-written, with sharp dialogue and memorable scenes.\n\nThe cinematography is another highlight of the film. The fight scenes are expertly shot, with dynamic camera movements and editing that capture the excitement and brutality of the sport. The film also does a good job of immersing the audience in the gritty world of Lowell, Massachusetts, where the story takes place.\n\nOn the negative side, some viewers may find the film to be formulaic and predictable, particularly in its portrayal of the underdog athlete overcoming obstacles to achieve success. Additionally, while the film does an excellent job of exploring the relationship between Micky and Dicky, it could have delved deeper into the other characters, such as Micky's mother and sisters, who are somewhat underdeveloped.\n\nOverall, \"The Fighter\" is a well-made and compelling drama/sport film that features excellent performances, strong storytelling, and impressive cinematography. It is definitely worth watching, especially for fans of boxing movies and biographical dramas.",

Because of how scripted and choreographed each fight scene feels, you are immediately pulled out of the story. Although not as bad as in some other films, the fighting is still a significant flaw.\n\nHaving said that, Christian Bale absolutely kills it in this and carries the movie. Worth watching just for his performance. The story of his character was very compelling. The rest of the characters did not resonate with me nearly as much.",

            "content": "Boxing pictures are like Oscar-season comfort food. We usually know the formula, but enough of the right ingredients--heart and inspiration--can make even the most run-of-the-mill films of this genre work. And it can usually mean the Academy will come calling at awards time. 'Rocky' had tremendous heart and soul. 'Raging Bull' made the fighting poetic and showed life beyond the ring to be gritty and tragic. 'Million Dollar Baby' brought a mortality edge and fatalism to the formula, along with a female lead. This David O. Russell true-story film can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those Best Picture winners, because despite its familiar underdog story and family melodrama, the superb actors elevate the entire film. Mark Wahlberg is at his best as \"Irish\" Micky Ward, a contender from the blue-collar town of Lowell, Mass. Wahlberg spent years getting this movie made, and those same years training for the role. He's always been believably athletic, but his physical immersion into this role along with his Massachusetts tough-guy street cred (see 'The Departed') feel so lived-in he's absolutely perfect in the role. Amy Adams does a 180, going from Disney princess to a spitfire barmaid. Her Charlene holds her own with anyone, and has the mouth to back it up. Adams transforms before our very eyes, and the effect leaves the viewer in awe. Melissa Leo is ferociously feral as Micky's mother/manager. She's a fine \"mother from hell,\" but is too good an actress to wander into caricature territory, infusing her character with moments of pathos that hit hard. And then there's Christian Bale. Stop printing those \"for your consideration\" ads and just GIVE the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to him. His performance as Micky's older crackhead brother, trying to recapture his own former boxing glory, is nothing short of pure genius. Bale has shown us greatness before, but he so immerses himself into this charming, funny, tragic, and very human man that it transcends anything he has done before. It's a role that, in lesser hands, could have wallowed in overacting, but Bale makes his character alternately detestable, charismatic, flawed but redemptive. The story hits the right notes, and ultimately is moving and inspiring, and not just in boxing terms. Russell absorbs us into this working class milieu, so much so we can almost smell the asphalt and the street-side trash coming off the screen. The boxing feels as close to the real thing as the movies have ever come. It's a great tale told with humanity and humor, and Russell, Wahlberg, Adams, Leo, and especially Bale make this an Oscar contender that is guaranteed to deliver a visceral, emotional knockout",

The film covers Ward's life from the midway point of his career until his opportunity to fight for the championship, ending just prior to his three legendary matches with Arturo Gatti, focusing heavily on his relationship with his deluded mother, who served as his manager, and his brother Dicky (Christian Bale), his drug-addicted, irresponsible trainer.  It's a tough and gritty film with some of the most realistic boxing scenes imaginable, especially the final fight.  The whole film smacks of reality \u2013 there's not a false note throughout. Every shot of every scene rings of the truth.",

The editing and cinematography are top-drawer especially as are the compellingly atmospheric score, the brilliant direction which seamlessly blends gritty realism and the theme of fighting-against-the-odds as seen in the finale and the script which has a lot of class and heart with the odd peppering of humour and good humour at that.\n\nWhat made The Fighter were the boxing fight sequences and the acting. The fight sequences are very kinetic, energetic and very exciting. And thanks to the quality of the direction and script, not to mention the acting, the characters are very credible and genuine. The acting is brilliant. Mark Wahlberg gives his best performance so far and provides the heart of the film, while Amy Adams is completely different from her Enchanted persona being more crude and less infectious in a cute way. But the best performances come from Christian Bale, who is just astonishing, and Melissa Leo who is equally a revelation.\n\nIn conclusion, a knockout of a film and one of the year's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The whole film seems to maturely live in the perturbed angst of life in Lowel, with it's drugs and violence, it's love and family charm. The charm of the film is the charm of life, it's not that it's easy or difficult, it's that it's real, and lively, and dark, and twisted, and playful, and energetic and worth doing and doing again.

Mark Wahlberg plays his role beautifully as well and I consider this one of his best performances, although in my country his dubbed version sounded very odd, in the original his accent is very great, as well as his feelings are well written and understood. The decorations and the aesthetic gives an atmosphere of the end of last century, which is very good.

Similar to his performance in The Machinist, he transformed himself in to the twitchy skeletal role of Dicky. With a goofy mouth and vacant stare he completely sells the idea of a drug-addled man. He picked up the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and wholeheartedly deserved it. \n\n\nAs much as The Fighter is a true underdog story, at the heart of the film lies the relationship or student vs mentor, athlete vs drug addict. How David O Russell created parallels between the chaos of the family and Micky's journey in the ring, one couldn't help but be reminded of Scorsese's Raging Bull.\n\n\nAlthough Russell's direction may not reach the standard of Scorsese. The director excels at the faster-paced moments. He captures the thrill of throwing punches in the ring, as the boxing scene are brilliantly energetic. Personally, I for one enjoyed how he captured these moments like a PPV boxing match. The footage became genuinely exciting and created an investment in the outcome of the fights.",

            "content": "This is the last David O. Russell film I have watched in my attempt to see all of his films and while it's not as bad as Three Kings (1999) and Accidental Love (2015) it doesn't reach the heights of Silver Linings Playbook (2012) or American Hustle (2013). It focuses on boxing, one of the most cinematically successful sports, but it doesn't differentiate itself enough from Rocky (1976) and Raging Bull (1980) to carve out it's own place in cinema. The best thing I could say about the film is that it is a showcase for great actors to give very showy performances and offer them an opportunity to win Academy awards for their performances. This isn't a film that I would urge people to see but it's decent enough to be worth a look at and it's not too trying as a viewing experience.\n\nSmall town boxer Micky Ward, Mark Wahlberg, is weighed down by his overbearing mother and manager Alice, Melissa Leo, and his cocaine addicted former boxer brother Dicky, Christian Bale. He loses a fight after being put up against someone far heavier than him but he manages to recuperate after cutting himself off from his family and beginning a relationship with the supportive Charlene, Amy Adams. When his brother enters prison the family faces more turmoil but Micky leans on him for advice in how to win fights and his influence ultimately proves to be positive if he can stay off the drugs.\n\nA lot of the film feels very artificial and emotionally manipulative as we get scenes of brother commiserating over their struggles and mothers admitting their faults. This is what really hurts the film because it doesn't successfully manipulate me enough that I can look past how contrived it all is and just accept the emotions I am feeling. I was angry at the film when one of Micky's victories caused me to choke up instead of feeling touched as I did at the end of Rocky when he reunites with Adrian. It's not to say the screenplay is not well structured or that it doesn't set up scenarios well that should bring tears to your eyes but it didn't move me and I felt that a lot of the film rested on how it was going to emotionally connect with me.\n\nThe performances were all pretty good although I felt most actors were rewarded more for their accumulated filmography than their specific performance in this film. Bale gets to be twitchy and desperate and show his commitment to the craft of acting by losing a lot of weight but he is impressive during the scene where he watches a documentary made about his life that comments on his cocaine addiction. Leo was fun as the ostentatious, difficult mother and her arguments with Adams were some of the funniest moments in the film. Wahlberg is actually very well cast as the lead character because it is clear that within the story he is meant to be the least interesting character and Wahlberg plays him as being as normal and mundane as he really would have been. I would have given Mark Ruffalo and Jacki Weaver the Best Suporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress awards respectively but I appreciate the fact that Christian Bale wasn't rewarded for a truly awful performance he had given in Vice (2018).\n\nRussell's nomination for directing slightly confuses me because despite the fact that the film is perfectly well made I never felt that he did anything that I had not seen done before with a film of this type. He offers unique direction to Silver Linings Playbook, where he has to tell a much harder story, and should have been rewarded for that but I don't feel ill will toward his nomination and much worse directors could have been selected.\n\nAgain, I would say that you should watch Champion (1949), Million Dollar Baby (2004) and The Harder They Fall (1956) before seeing this film because they all offer something a bit fresher but this isn't a film without merit. Russell has done better work but he has also done worse and I would much rather watch this film than some of the worse sports films that have recently been released.",

And though everyone gives great performance, the discussion starts with Christian Bale (Dicky Eklund). For a long time, Bale was one of the best actors to never be nominated for an Oscar. He finally did after this movie and he won. His completely became Dicky, nailing the voice, mannerisms and essence, as well as losing a ton of weight for the role. Melissa Leo (Alice), Mark Walhberg (Micky) and Amy Adams (Charlene) all bring their A game as well. I also must commend the boxing scenes. They felt much more realistic than a lot of other boxing flicks. It added a lot to the tension of those scenes.\n\nWeaknesses: Though the four main characters are all tremendous, the rest of the cast is largely forgettable. None of them have much depth. The group of sisters are some of the most annoying side characters I can recall. I can also see some people having an issue with how little boxing there is in the film. It's more about the family drama than the sport. That was fine, for the most part, though I think a bit more boxing would've been beneficial. \n\nOverall: If you go in wanting to see a lot of boxing and training montages like this was Rocky IV, you'll probably be disappointed. If you want a gripping story, stellar performances and emotional drama, you've come to the right place. One of the best movies about boxing ever.",

There is like No boxing in this film , like 4 minutes of actual boxing matches ,an actual boxing drama could have that little time of boxing but it needs to be good! Every punch must be carefully choreographed and not look well fake , and it's so short and forced, like the boxer mark wahlberg guy, he got hit like a million times, and he didn't even fall or anything , then when he hits the other guy once in the head chest and waist , it doesn't even look like punching! And the opponent gets defeated like what? The first boxing match where he fights a guy he shouldn't be fighting was equally as short and bad like it was like 50 seconds long, and it affected the whole story of the film, the second act was a lot better , the characters were \"DEVELOPED\" Amy adams and Melissa Leo was good mark wahlberg mumbles and was still bad, like if I hadn't turned on subtitles I would never know what he is saying, his brother goes to jail and it's sad and emotional , then the ending is ... is so cliche bland emotionally manipulative mEAWTW, predictable! like of course mark wahlberg is gonna be like losing the match but then he suddenly land like 5 punches and win,the middle of the story I won't even go into deytail it's so cliched like amy Adams and the new manager don't want mark wahlberg and his mom to be involved cuz they are assholes, then the mom and the sisters like mark wahlberg has like a lot of sisters but they do nothing except get in a fight with any adams so they fight Amy Adams and since they fought on the doorstep of Amy Adams home Amy Adams just went back into her home and shut the door so yeah... \nKay get in the good stuff there actually are! Christian bale, the brother character performance is like amazing, it sticks out like a sore thumb and his character is like AMAZING like his character is so compelling, Christian bale is the brother to mark wahlberg  and he is the heart and soul of this movie every seen of him is breathtaking and he has good chemistry with every character in the film, Melissa Leo is also quite good",

I can\u0092t remember if I\u0092ve ever seen more convincing fights on screen that looked so much like the the two actors were swinging and connecting for real. This helps a lot and actually had me gritting my teeth with tension and wondering if Mark Wahlberg would be OK. That kind of moment, when I completely disconnect from the fact that I\u0092m watching a movie and it feels like a real sport, is so rare and is one of my favorite experiences.\n\nOf course I wouldn\u0092t care one bit about that experience if they didn\u0092t get me invested in the characters. This dysfunctional family was a bit infuriating at times, to the point that I was getting extremely annoyed. I always struggle with films that have a likeable protagonist that I identify with, and then they put him through a never-ending series of frustrating circumstances. However there\u0092s this moment of realization for the family and I started to sympathize. I could see the struggle of Mark Wahlberg and his effort to balance his life, and it made me care more about him more.\n\nThe Fighter is a very human story and feels authentic. It\u0092s no surprise this is based on a true story, because it isn\u0092t sanitized and given a bunch of Hollywood flair. Most of the acting was spectacular, and the accents were delivered well. I\u0092m not sure Amy Adams was quite the right actress to play the tough-as-nails girlfriend who stands up to the whole family. It\u0092s not that she can\u0092t handle the role, it just didn\u0092t seem to fit her all that well. I expected to have a similar reaction to Christian Bale, but he was great and seemed to fit his role perfectly.

However, knowing the director, I was expecting a \"look how good my actors are\" type of movie. This was a perfect blend of both of those. It is a boxing movie but it doesn't feel like a direct copy of Rocky. It is a story of family and the troubles of drug addiction tearing family apart. A story like this can often lead to over acting, however, the actors, especially Christian Bale bring it. Mark Wahlberg is always great although he plays a similar note in all his movies and Amy Adams does transform into a sassy bartender, but easily the best performance is Christian Bale. Complete transformation. He deserved that Oscar 100%. All the great acting in this film really helps you connect with the characters and gets your really invested in the story, so props to the movie for doing that. The fight scenes are great as well adding in some intensity to the film. Overall, The Fighter is not a movie you absolutely need to rush out to watch right now, but if you do decide to do that, you'll have yourself a great movie to watch!",

Mark Wahlberg is pretty good, and Christian Bale is very committed and is just fantastic in this that I'm glad that he got an Academy Award for it. The chemistry between the brothers is so good and convincing that they are brothers, and that whenever one of them gets in trouble and the other one hates him for it, they still love each other no matter what, and they they need each other. Melissa Leo is really great in it, and so is Amy Adams. The characters are memorable that you can still tell what they been though which I felt sorry for some of them while also hating them at the same time. The fight scenes are entertaining to watch and felt very realistic. What I like about the film is that that it focuses more on the characters than on the fight scenes, which would fail if the characters are boring, and they are not. Most of them are enjoyable over the top that the movie knew about it and put them in a lot while still making Mark Wahlberg the main and tamed character. The plot is fairly predictable which is the only thing that's negative about it, but it didn't take me out of it as The Fighter stands out as a fighting movie because of David O. Russell's direction, the writing, and the actors themselves.",

Bale was breathtaking in this film, and puts fine performances by Whalberg and Adams in a cloud of dust. The story is very deep and dramatic, but not too much that it got melodramatic and annoying. The setting, and the tone/look of the environment the characters were in was extremely well done, and felt very real. As with all boxing movies it seems, it is impossible to steer away from the cliches that are prominent in this film too. However, The Fighter definitely has enough heart and hard-hitting scenes not only through the family tension that is created but in the boxing scenes too, which were also a very good part of the movie.

Russell is out of chances. Although I did enjoy this a little more than \"American Hustle\", \"The Fighter\" is just too clich\u00e9d and still features the 'David O Russell formula'. What is the 'Russell formula'? 1) Unlikable characters. 2) Lots of people yelling, fighting, and treating other characters like crap. 3) Still getting lots of praise and awards for it. A word to the not-so-wise, David, having characters yell and act like assholes does NOT make them \"deep\" or \"tortured\" unless you show it. You did that with Bale in this film, who was much more enjoyable in the second half of the movie. Wahlberg's mom and sisters on the other hand, are never given a reason as to why they are such assholes, they just are, which makes me HATE when they are on screen. Amy Adams is OK but I wouldn't call her performance \"award-worthy\". Hell, Wahlberg almost sleepwalks through the whole movie. And in the end, the film boils down to a clich\u00e9 ridden, underdog sports movie that has been done a million times before. Only this film has the addition of unlikable characters. I don't care if this is how the actual people acted in real life, the tired, dated, and obvious formula is still there. I hate to use the term \"overrated\", but that is exactly what David O. Russell is to me, overrated. In my mind, you deserve none of the praise, and awards that you have gotten. I gave you three films, THREE FILMS that got you nominations from the Academy, some of them you actually won. I don't care if you direct the next James Bond, the next \"Casino\", or the next \"Godfather\", I am done with you! So congratulations David O.

In the limelight again, a good 10 years after his knock-out claim to fame over Sugar Ray Leonard; Dicky is being escorted by HBO through out his daily life, recording on what we are lead to believe will be a documentary about his glorious return to the ring.\n\nThe crew follow him around at home, about town, in the car and whilst training his kid half-brother, Micky (Mark Wahlberg). The only other male in the extensively confusing family brood of nine siblings, Micky idolises his older bother and sits directly in his shadow to also become a champion. \n\nLike the rest in his overbearing and blinded by love family, Micky suffers in silence and lives in denial about the destructive harm Dicky consistently inflicts, always Looking passed his bothers woefully unreliable coaching, his 'shame of Lowell' crack addicted antics and his lack of management standing. \n\nAfter last minute schedule changes of a new 20Ibs plus substitute opponent, Micky once again takes it in his brother's issues in his stride and agrees to continue in the fight; left far more battered and bruised that should ever have been allowed, Micky is disheartened and disillusioned with the whole thing. \n\nUntil he meets Charlene (Amy Adams); a stronger woman than the family's female horde put together, Charlene is a college drop out turned bar wench determined not to let Dicky's personal same ruin Micky's entire life. \n\nWith Charlene's unwavering support he steps away from his controlling family and finds new management. Sending a rift through the entire brood and fuels Dicky's inexcusable behaviour to reach a peak, a police fight over nothing leaves Dicky drying out in jail and Micky with a broken hand and broken career. Can Micky come back and to win on his own, will Dicky find a way to make sure he stays the families number one or will Dicky finally support his brother?\n\nAs a non Christian Bale fan, it really pains me to say that in this role he was a stand out. Delivering a complex and complete characterisation with wonderful nerve-jangling texture, this performance (and his dangerously underweight look) is highly reminiscent of his insomnia riddled role in The Machinist and well deserving of his up coming 2011 best supporting actor Oscar nomination.\n\nMark Wahlberg is strong in the well rounded and likeable hero torn between adoration and anguish role. Melissa Leo is fantastically believable as their highly possessive mother Alice; and Amy Adams excels as Micky's tactless but educated pillar of moral support girlfriend. \n\nThe Verdict: Focused on relationships, bad habits and balance rather than the single road to glory, The Fighter reinforces the power of family; irrespective of how dysfunctional and self-destructive that family may be. \n\nMinus a few pacing issues, this story, like the real \"Irish\" Micky Ward, climaxes on an explosive note in the ninth round...  \n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 28/01/2011",

            "content": "4/5. The tumultuous emergence of boxer Mickey Ward as a force to be reckoned with in the 1990's is documented with palpable urgency and heart in David O'Russell's condensed but satisfying take on his story. O'Russell adeptly presents a dual narrative of two brothers - one (Mark Wahlberg, playing Ward) who comes to prominence as a boxer after accepting the reality of the weight of his family upon his potential, the other (Christian Bale) who relinquishes the pipe dreams of his younger self and overcomes his drug addiction.  \n\nBale just about chews the scenery but really is a joy to behold as the drug-addled man-child who once knocked down Sugar Ray Leonard in the ring.  Wahlberg's performance is a more subtle and refined study in emotional avoidance and withdrawal, eventually exploding in the ring against his opponent in the film's climactic title fight.  The fight sequences in this film were shot by the actual HBO film crew who filmed the real-life matches being broadcastat the time, and it shows.  These sequences feel very real and are unhampered by the filmic bombast that ruined the fight sequences in 2016's \"Creed\".  \n\n\"The Fighter\" is an expertly paced story, populated by an excellent cast (Melissa Leo as the family matriarch is so wonderful, she could have been a John Cassavetes regular) and only occasionally feels trite.  There are shades of Scorsese in some of the cinematography, which actually works well, without diminishing O'Russell's voice as director.  Easily the best hollywood boxing movie since \"Rocky\".",

Nonetheless, this movie does not fail to hit hard both in the drama and the boxing department. I found myself very emotionally tied to the boxing and to the family/romantic drama contained within. That is to say that both the suspense of the fights and the development of the characters is superb. In short, this movie is well written.\n\nMr. Bale and Mr. Wahlberg also give stunning performances. It is certain that Mr. Bale deserved the oscar for best supporting actor (if anything for loosing all of the weight he did for the role!). I would add however, that sometimes Mr. Bale's character overshadowed the main character of Mr. Wahlberg. \n\nAs a final note, technically speaking, I felt that the cinematography was good and for the most part appropriate, but sometimes distracting and a bit to creative for a boxing movie. That may be more of a personal preference, but there you have it. \n\nSo definitely check this movie out, especially if you are into an excellent drama, romance, boxing flick!",

I'm not even talking about the documentary-type style of narrative and camerawork, or the scary-natural performances from everyone in the cast. I'm talking about the intensely character -driven script that delves into the psyches and relationships of everyone involved in a way that somehow avoids manipulating you feel a certain way. The result is a character study with such a depth of ability that the scenes of actual boxing are almost anticlimactic",

Boxing provides all the elements of classic sport films clich\u00e9s, such as the underdog being able to achieve and for dynamic relationships with complete drama and depth.  All of this is displayed in the jaw dropping film, The Fighter.  This film follows the life of \"Irish\" boxer Micky Ward and his uphill battle in the boxing ring.  More interestingly, this film also follows his relationships with his brother, family and girlfriend by putting three complex characters into dramatic situations.  I think this movie is great because it shows the different perspective on the challenges that athletes have to overcome to achieve success.  I like how the movie follows less his competition in the ring and more of Micky's battle with his impossible family and that his family, not other fighters, is what stands in his way as a successful boxer.  The movie captures this spectacularly dysfunctional family very well through Micky's up and down boxing career.  I would say, compared to other movies, this movie fails to capture the overall spirit of boxing and the drive to achieve greatness in the sport.  The lack of tough training sessions and captivating punches in the ring give dispute to whether it should be considered a true sports film but the reoccurring theme of family lifts the film to new heights in sports film.",

            "content": "David O. Russell combo's up with a tremendous cast to produce a standard of film making not seen in quite some time. The Fighter follows the real life brothers of Dick and Mickey Ward, the former a has been boxer, the latter an outlet for his brother and mother to try and become famous and make money. Since becoming past it Dickie has played the balancing act of crack addict and trainer for Mick, while also trying to make money by ruining himself in a HBO documentary. Mickey eventually meets a new spark in his life Charleen who tries to set him on the right path as Dickie and his mother Alice continually try and hold him back. Imagine Rocky but better. Christian Bale is, as always on the ball, hes methodical craft see's him lose yet again a tonne of weight and yet again portray a character so unrecodnisable to us as fans that its a joy to behold. Mark Walhberg is the glue however. While Bale is bringing the larger than life character to fruitation, Wahlberg is our connection to the film, he perfectly hits subtle and honest notes as a human being, struggling to juggle family and career. He deserves just as much credit as Bale. Amy Adams oh my god, yet again brings a performance worth every dime, she constantly, perfectly flits between supporting Mickey and leaving him out to dry, in a situation that makes her come across as completely human. And Melissa Leo works wonders as the overly attached mother Alice. The script is brilliant, giving us what we want, no garbage, no small talk, it gives us pure character and development. It never feels forced and not one moment stands out like a sore thumb. David O. Russell just knows where to put the camera as well, one scene in particular see's an intense conversation between the brothers. Instead of 5 different camera set ups, he sticks with one, panning left and right depending on who we need to get the relevant information out of. In fact he fully realises that film is a visual medium, giving us all the detail we need but never overloading us or boring us by being overly flamboyant with the camera or technique. The soundtrack is immense, fitting perfectly into the edit, which just flows and flows, this movie does not feel as long as its running time suggests. In fact i was almost shocked when it ended. I had completely fallen into a world where time flew by as i was so engrossed in the characters and story, the world created, the look and feel, the vintage grade on the boxing matches themselves, which at points show an agonising side to boxing. There is even a Rocky-Esque montage, but minus the cheese factor. Much like his successor to The Fighter, American Hustle, not everyone is going to enjoy this outing. It doesn't spell things out, its very chatty in places and can be alienating to an audience who would like to see these actors in a more conventional role. If you, like me however can get behind a solid story, told by solid acting and technical and visual ability, without being spoon fed and having your typical cliches turn up every 2 minutes, David O. Russell is a talent to keep an eye on and The Fighter is a must own!",

Russell is out of chances. Although I did enjoy this a little more than \"American Hustle\", \"The Fighter\" is just too cliched and still features the 'David O Russell formula'. What is the 'Russell formula'? 1) Unlikable characters. 2) Lots of people yelling, fighting, and treating other characters like crap. 3) Still getting lots of praise and awards for it. A word to the not-so-wise, David, having characters yell and act like a**holes does NOT make them \"deep\" or \"tortured\" unless you show it. You did that with Bale in this film, who was much more enjoyable in the second half of the movie. Wahlberg's mom and sisters on the other hand, are never given a reason as to why they are such a**holes, they just are, which makes me HATE when they are on screen. Amy Adams is OK but I wouldn't call her performance \"award-worthy\". Hell, Wahlberg almost sleepwalks through the whole movie. And in the end, the film boils down to a cliche ridden, underdog sports movie that has been done a million times before. Only this film has the addition of unlikable characters. I don't care if this is how the actual people acted in real life, the tired, dated, and obvious formula is still there. I hate to use the term \"overrated\", but that is exactly what David O. Russell is to me, overrated. In my mind, you deserve none of the praise, and awards that you have gotten. I gave you three films, THREE FILMS that got you nominations from the Academy, some of them you actually won. I don't care if you direct the next James Bond, the next \"Casino\", or the next \"Godfather\", I am done with you! So congratulations David O.

The movie explores the social aspects of their life, and how even those who have risen up from their troubled backgrounds can still be dragged down by the people who they stay in contact with.

            "content": "When a boxing movie is done right, something special happens.  Not only does the main fight itself reek with suspense, but the individuals involved become something of a wonder, possibly even becoming more consuming than all of the action.  \"The Fighter\" sees the genre win time and time again, not only cementing David O. Russell's status as being one of the finest filmmakers of his generation, but showcasing the immense talents of the four leading actors.\n            Taking place in 1993, \"The Fighter\" follows the story of Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), a promising boxer that is used to living in the shadow of his brother Dicky (Christian Bale), a has-been professional who has long squandered away his talents in trade of a favoring of crack cocaine.  Dicky longs to make a comeback, but those around him can tell that Micky is the one to set their sights on.     \n            The latter sees that he would have no problem taking up a boxing career, and at first, is hindered by Dicky himself and his denial prone, overly-zealous mother (Melissa Leo).  But after gaining backup from the eye-catching Charlene (Amy Adams), Micky convinces his over-the-top family that he's the right material.  Though he suffers many upsetting defeats and a bevy of personal setbacks, he ends up succeeding.\n            \"The Fighter\" is unlike most boxing movies because it manages to be so good in so many other areas that if you took the boxing topic out completely, it would still hold a type of interest that only the best kinds of movies are lucky enough to have in their possession. \n            What makes the film work so well in the first place is the zingy rapport between the actors, all of whom manage to make the inner-relationships between them appear like a true family.  Maybe not a pretty family, exactly - between Dicky's addiction, he and Mickey's mother's tawdry personality, and their seven boisterous, gum-chewing sisters, there's always a mess to be cleaned up.  But no matter, it makes for stirring entertainment.\n            Wahlberg has never been better, and never has there been a role more suited for him.  A thuggish, brooding figure, Wahlberg ensnares Micky's reserved, determined qualities.  He makes for a perfect foil for Bale, who may give his finest performance here (although, who knows what's left to come in his career). \nBale has made a career full of interesting characterizations, never backing down from a role, gaining or losing weight as needed, and researching as if it were for a college research paper.  As Dicky, he's spectacularly spot-on, especially if you've seen the real man himself.  He's supremely twitchy and drug-muddled, grasping on to his past successes with white knuckles and not focusing on the terrible life he's made for himself.  Seeing him fall and Micky rise is often times heartbreaking, but it's unfortunately well-deserved.\n            But it isn't just these two extraordinary actors that rule the film, but also Adams and Leo, who remain note-perfect and completely convincing throughout.  Adams, famous in public life as being a cheerful, kind woman does a complete 360 as Micky's girlfriend Charlene.  She has the mouth of a sailor, and isn't afraid to speak her mind - in essence, she's a sexy bitch that has the intelligence to match her looks. \nLeo tops the entire cast as the mother of Dicky and Micky - though not addicted to drugs, it's easy to see she's kind of a wreck, with her nine children in tow, dirtily bleached hair, leathered skin, and tight clothing.  It's clear to see that she is a woman who clings to the past just as much as Dicky, and it isn't a secret that it wrenches her heart every time the latter lands himself in jail or in another crack house.  Leo is outstanding, and her chemistry with Adams and the rest of her ensemble crackles with energy.\nBut without David O. Russell, \"The Fighter\" would not have the same sensation that it should brag to have.  Russell doesn't merely have the actors tell the story, but he moves the film along with consuming atmosphere, set to a blistering soundtrack and a small town that gives the feeling of open opportunity.  What's even more impressive is that Russell directed the film with the real-life counterparts of the portrayed people in the film constantly at his side.  He not only manages to tell their story with truth that sometimes punches you in the gut, but makes them a fascinating group that only a movie could create with such madcap intensity.\n            Micky may win the final fight, but it isn't that that matters.  It's what he has overcome, and what the journey held that sticks with you.",

            "content": "David O. Russell has always had a sort of technique that I love to watch him direct with. I first noticed it in Silver Linings Playbook and now I see it here, in the film that brought him from basically the new Hollywood blacklist: Douchebagery. Yes, we've all known David O. Russell's past. His experience with George Clooney and his infamous behind the scenes look during I Heart Huckabees and his fight with Lily Tomlin. After that, David O Russell basically went into hiding, not making a film until this one. And it was a good film to come back on. Previously, O Russell had only made comedy movies, but now he comes down to making a story of family and ambition. It was a movie that surprised me, and one that I enjoyed thoroughly. Russell distinct direction took this film miles, and it was miles I definitely wanted to be apart of the ride. And now, while I felt he was still exploring his direction in this movie, it did not mean it was totally absent. Simply, at times his direction was confused and didn't know if it wanted comedy, drama, or heartwarmth. But it was good most of the time, even if the script fell flat. The way he moves the camera around, the way he lets the actors act as he films them acting, rather than them acting as he films. It's good direction, and one that would be most prevalent in my favorite movie of his to date, American Hustle, and one that would be at it's maturity in Silver Linings Playbook. Russell can direct, and although his story isn't of a director from rags to riches, but rather of a director from confusion to humbleness. And that is clearly shown in this movie.\r\n\r\n   The Fighter is 2010 drama boxing film directed by David O Russell and starring Christian Bale, Mark Whalberg, Amy Adams, and Melissa Leo. A brilliant cast and characters, The Fighter really stands out with its acting. David O Russell has a way of directing these characters to not only have a feel of comedy to them and drama, but to make them feel so real. Christian Bale's character Dickey Ecklund was heartfelt and down to earth, rather than crazy and outgoing, while he is that, but he still has a kind of an honest, innocent touch to him. Mark Whalberg only wants what he thinks is best for family, and even though the family wants the best for him, Melissa Leo's character does not always show that. Amy Adams character keep Whalberg on his feet and keeps him aware his family might not be all that great, but it's a struggle for Whalberg as he trys everything he can to please the people of his town and to please his family, but th4ee story slowly start to let you understand that he can do both. The acting is great all around, and while Bale did have the strongest Supporting Actor performance of 2010, in other years he would not be able to hold up that great. Melissa Leo was good, but she was kind of forgettable as were a lot of other characters in the film, causing a little drawback from the movie. Still, the entire cast acted true and it all felt real, and I thought it was a strong cast of very talented actors.\r\n\r\n   The screenplay was also good, and it was nominated at the Academy Awards, but it was the biggest flaw in the movie. At times, the story did not know whether it wanted to be an intense family drama or rather a humorous character study. David O Russell directs well enough to blend it all in together, but it's still very convoluted and varies in emotions multiple times I a scene. Also, the dialogue is not memorable at all, and while the story remains prominent, it does not seem special and only feels like a boxing film with a family background. It definitely is not your everyday sports movie, and does not rely completely on the sport itself, even with the title being \"The Fighter\". It relies more on Whalberg's character to explore whether he cares about the sport more, or his family. And the outcome is heartwarming, even writing out about it puts a sappy feeling inside me that I like. Yes, though, there are some clich\u00e9s in the movie, like the conclusion of the final fight, which I felt was a badly directed. Other than that, the screenplay works well, but it was not completely pulled in together.\r\n\r\n   David O Russell's direction is something to enjoy in this movie. At times, yea, the direction looks under developed, but it is not amateur. It looks like a director coming back and making it big, and instead of forcing things to be his way, he works with the movie to create an equal vision. Sometimes the vision gets blurred, such as the ending of the last fight, which I thought was rushed and kind of abrupt, and also other scenes where characters suddenly change and the movement of the camera does not work. But his now signature style in which he moves the camera around the actor instead of the actor moving around the camera is enjoyable to watch. Russell also makes hectic scenes good, especially when all the characters are in one room or place just shouting and getting angry at each other. You can feel the love between the characters when watching this movie, and the joy it puts in you while these scenes occur does not happen much. It really is only a feeling I feel in O Russell movies, like I did in Silver Lining Playbook and at times with American Hustle. He makes these characers unique, and not only that, but he makes them real. And that's what Russell does the very best. He brings out the realism in the emotions of characters, and leaves certain things in characters hidden and left for only the audience to figure out. Russell is a master at making the characters relatable to everyone in different ways, whether it be they have a money struggle or if they can't reach a certain goal. Everyone in this movie wants the best for themselves and for each other, and everyone is confused and feel they haven't given their best. The movie is strong and engaging, and whenever a character does something, the audience understands why. It's a gift of Russell that is disappointing has come out this late in his career, but it is also satisfying to now that he found it.\r\n\r\n   Whalberg, Bale, Adams, and Leo all give excellent performances in a film stock full of characters. Some are not memorable, while others remain in your mind, but it is hard to forget the way these characters made you feel as you watched the movie. Russell's direction keeps these emotions with you as you leave the movie, and reminds you of them more and more as you think back to the movie. The writing is fine, at times being a little confusing and unsure about the path it wants to take the audience, but David O Russell brings the best in the emotions and directs the script well. His signature style of movement and scenes of chaos are not fully mature in the movie, and while he does take control of the film, at times it feels like he is simply filming the screenplay. But this happens only a few times, and the rest is an enjoyable ride of drama, commotion, laughs, and sincerity. I thought The Fighter was a great movie, and while not the best boxing film I've ever seen, it is truly one of the best I have seen about family. And one that made the movies accept David O Russell as a part of our family. 8/10.",

            "content": "The Fighter is the first film I have seen from David O. Russell and this is the film that really made me took notice of him. The Fighter had some strong competition during that year which may have caused the film to be lost within the hype of the other films like Black Swan, The Social Network and Inception.\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson. I have not seen any of the films that these writers have made aside from this but I have seen moments from 8 Mile (written by Scott Silver). The best aspects from his writing in 8 Mile was definitely put in The Fighter's screenplay with problems and relationships that feel natural and empathetic. The film focuses on these relationships and how it affects the protagonist. From the beginning of the film, it is easy to see that Micky Ward is driven by the influences from his life and it keeps going that way until Ward himself finally has a grasp on his needs and what is essential to succeed in his career and in a way his personal life. People may see Micky Ward as a guy who can't decide what he wants and not independent enough to make his own decisions. This didn't bother me because these characters are so well defined and their presence and effect on Micky that his emotional and mental condition throughout the film is justifiable. The film also touches on Micky's brother, mother and girlfriend. Their stories and relationship with each other are interesting to watch even if at times it may come off as clich\u00e9 or melodramatic. The dialogue in this film for the most part surprisingly entertaining with moments that will have you laughing or feeling sad. The well written relationships and the entertaining dialogue drives this film effectively even if the plot sometimes doesn't stray off the mainstream.\n\nDavid O. Russell directed this feature and I see The Fighter as his comeback film showing what a force he is in the industry. I Heart Huckabees was the film before this and that was considered for the most part as a failure, though I have not seen the film and it may change my views towards the film after viewing it. David O. Russell really wanted to make this film be focused with the characters and their relationships rather than the style and visual beauty of the sport. That move was risky as I was afraid Russell may not bring anything new to the genre and it'll just recycle the stories with new characters. Russell wanted this film to be driven more by the performances and he succeeded with characters you would just love to see on screen and I felt he really did bring the best out of these actors because they all seem to be outside their usual stereotypes. While that is going on, he was still able to craft a well done underdog story driven by the protagonist's relationships.\n\nThe Fighter's cinematographer is Hoyte Van Hoytema who only gained recognition and success in his work in Let The Right One In. I think The Fighter is his first Hollywood film and what a way to break in. Hoytema and Russell has taken a much more handheld personal camcorder kind of style of photography having us feel like we are standing next to these characters as things unfold. I personally liked this approach and at first I was a bit afraid that the handheld style may lead to borderline erratic but it's maintained and carefully handled here. The film jumps back and forth a few times with a cinematic feel and a television sports broadcasting style in telling the story. The former features bulk of the film and the latter is only during the main fights. The latter at times do take away from the personal and intimate approach and this is mostly felt on the deep scenes between characters during the fight, particularly at the climax. There was a moment in the film that I really enjoyed and that was the scene where Micky Ward gains momentum and starts to go on the right track, the scenes that unfolds during this moment are quick scenes of Ward winning against his opponents. Russell and Hoytema during these scenes looked like it was heavily influenced by Raging Bull where the focus is between the fighters and the background just looks blank with a monotone color filling it. I thought this was a nice touch.\n\nThe Fighter is much more soundtrack driven rather than score driven and it does work for me, though I do wonder how different the tone of the film would be if Michael Brook, the composer for the film, was given the opportunity to create a score replacing the soundtracks. Sometimes in sports films, soundtracks do become a bit clich\u00e9 and tend to use the same type of music but here I didn't feel that as the tracks are placed in specific moments that it didn't distract me or having me feel that it was cheesy. Michael Brook's score was great when it comes on but it's very rare that I do hear it due to maybe the fact that Russell might feel it may detract from the characters and having us think that it's more than what it is, well it's not and Russell doesn't want us to search for something that isn't really there.\n\nThe acting in this film is the main reason that this film is given much praise as it boasts the best performance from Christian Bale, Mark Whalberg, Melissa Leo and Amy Adams so far. I was glad to see that the Academy was able to give them credit where it was due but I was a bit disappointed to see Whalberg on not being nominated. I was amazed on Bale's transformation, just from the first shot where he appears he just looks sickly and disgusting. I was also impressed with Adams transition from her good girl characters to this tough and assertive woman who takes control of the scene every time she's on. Melissa Leo definitely was a standout in this film too who always strives for attention and to be the best in the scene, she seems to get the bets reactions from the actors therefore making the scenes much more effective. Jack McGee was really entertaining to see here, either being subtly funny or being able to add on the drama of the scene. I wish he is able to get much better roles in the future.\n\nThe Fighter so far is one of my favorite sports films of all time and also it is tied as my favorite from David O. Russell. I am glad to see Russell coming back and continues to make great films (SIlver Linings Playbook & the upcoming American Hustle).",

The Fighter, another wonderful installment in this soon-to-be-legendary director's remarkable filmography, is one of the best-scripted, well-acted, and powerfully shot films of the 2000s decade, on par with other recent greats such as 50/50 or In Bruges in some respects. Every performance in this film is infectiously great, the plot is strong and features a powerful twist halfway through (which I am going to spoil, so don't read any further if you haven't seen the movie), and the cinematography is excellent. In short, it's a David O. Russell film.\r\n\r\nThe Fighter plays out like a re-imagining of Good Will Hunting, and it appropriately stars Matt Damon's evil twin, Mark Wahlberg, as the titular character. Wahlberg plays Micky Ward, a down-and-out boxer trying to get ahead in life and simultaneously live up to the tremendously low bar set by his older brother (Christian Bale), who won a match with Sugar Ray Leonard once and has now become a raging crack addict. Wahlberg has never impressed me much, but he was certainly better than average in this film, and even if he didn't quite carry the movie, he didn't have to either. This is thanks mostly to Bale, who I used to think was bland and boring, but has now proven himself to me with a string of tour de forces in this, American Hustle, and American Psycho. His unsettling, twitchy character garnered him a Best Supporting Actor win, and although he probably had a lot of fun playing the part, it's not one of those performances where the actor is clearly enjoying it more than the audience. \r\n\r\nThe supporting cast is spectacular as well, and although they will undoubtedly disgust you a lot, they'll charm the hell out of you just as much. Amy Adams (who isn't a great actress) fills the role of Ward's girlfriend with poise and a great accent-- Joseph Gordon-Levitt should have taken lessons from her when he made Don Jon. Ward's family is white trash, which some audience members will have a tough time getting past, but they do have their moments. The group of sisters is hilarious and terrifying at the same time, with each one uglier than the next, and all of them nodding in unison whenever their control freak of a mother makes a statement. Sure, they're a group of nasty little troll-like creatures. But they're still family.\r\n\r\nBut Bale's story arc is what really makes this movie. After telling everyone in his family that he's in an HBO documentary on his comeback, he turns on the TV only to find that the special is on crack addiction in America, and that he is the star. This is one of the most heartbreaking scenes of all time, when Bale watches the TV in prison and his face morphs into a look of horror and understanding, realizing that his family back home is watching it as well. There are two jaw-drop moments like this in The Fighter, and the other is at the end. I won't spoil it, but I will say that the conclusion to this film will have you more worried about a boxing match than you've ever been in your life (yes, even if you had money on it). Because the film is based on a true story, and most people aren't familiar with the world of boxing, the movie instills a true doubt in your mind about whether or not Ward will actually win the fight. All movies should be this tense.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for The Fighter: 8/10 stars. Easily one of Russell's best films and one of the best movies ever in general, this movie is powerful, emotional, and superbly acted. It doesn't base any of its charm on sentimentality or manipulating the audience, which I respect immensely. Instead, it shot past that cheap and easy technique and went for pure, unbridled, and raw emotion. Don't let the boxing backdrop fool you if you're not a fan of the sport: This movie is about redemption and family. Not many films these days are capable of displaying the wide range of depth that The Fighter does. In fact, three of the others I can think of are all David O. Russell films. But now that this great director has come into his own with a string of mainstream successes, we may finally see some more great drama like this in theaters. And that makes every flaw in this film worth it.\r\n\r\nOh, and Jed Groff's friend plays Ward's daughter, so when you get to the \"A NEW APARTMENT! YAAAY!\" part, pause it.",

            "content": "The Fighter is the first film I have seen from David O. Russell and this is the film that really made me took notice of him. The Fighter had some strong competition during that year which may have caused the film to be lost within the hype of the other films like Black Swan, The Social Network and Inception.\n\nThe film's screenplay was written by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson. I have not seen any of the films that these writers have made aside from this but I have seen moments from 8 Mile (written by Scott Silver). The best aspects from his writing in 8 Mile was definitely put in The Fighter's screenplay with problems and relationships that feel natural and empathetic. The film focuses on these relationships and how it affects the protagonist. From the beginning of the film, it is easy to see that Micky Ward is driven by the influences from his life and it keeps going that way until Ward himself finally has a grasp on his needs and what is essential to succeed in his career and in a way his personal life. People may see Micky Ward as a guy who can't decide what he wants and not independent enough to make his own decisions. This didn't bother me because these characters are so well defined and their presence and effect on Micky that his emotional and mental condition throughout the film is justifiable. The film also touches on Micky's brother, mother and girlfriend. Their stories and relationship with each other are interesting to watch even if at times it may come off as clich\u00e9 or melodramatic. The dialogue in this film for the most part surprisingly entertaining with moments that will have you laughing or feeling sad. The well written relationships and the entertaining dialogue drives this film effectively even if the plot sometimes doesn't stray off the mainstream.\n\nDavid O. Russell directed this feature and I see The Fighter as his comeback film showing what a force he is in the industry. I Heart Huckabees was the film before this and that was considered for the most part as a failure, though I have not seen the film and it may change my views towards the film after viewing it. David O. Russell really wanted to make this film be focused with the characters and their relationships rather than the style and visual beauty of the sport. That move was risky as I was afraid Russell may not bring anything new to the genre and it'll just recycle the stories with new characters. Russell wanted this film to be driven more by the performances and he succeeded with characters you would just love to see on screen and I felt he really did bring the best out of these actors because they all seem to be outside their usual stereotypes. While that is going on, he was still able to craft a well done underdog story driven by the protagonist's relationships.\n\nThe Fighter's cinematographer is Hoyte Van Hoytema who only gained recognition and success in his work in Let The Right One In. I think The Fighter is his first Hollywood film and what a way to break in. Hoytema and Russell has taken a much more handheld personal camcorder kind of style of photography having us feel like we are standing next to these characters as things unfold. I personally liked this approach and at first I was a bit afraid that the handheld style may lead to borderline erratic but it's maintained and carefully handled here. The film jumps back and forth a few times with a cinematic feel and a television sports broadcasting style in telling the story. The former features bulk of the film and the latter is only during the main fights. The latter at times do take away from the personal and intimate approach and this is mostly felt on the deep scenes between characters during the fight, particularly at the climax. There was a moment in the film that I really enjoyed and that was the scene where Micky Ward gains momentum and starts to go on the right track, the scenes that unfolds during this moment are quick scenes of Ward winning against his opponents. Russell and Hoytema during these scenes looked like it was heavily influenced by Raging Bull where the focus is between the fighters and the background just looks blank with a monotone color filling it. I thought this was a nice touch.\n\nThe Fighter is much more soundtrack driven rather than score driven and it does work for me, though I do wonder how different the tone of the film would be if Michael Brook, the composer for the film, was given the opportunity to create a score replacing the soundtracks. Sometimes in sports films, soundtracks do become a bit clich\u00e9 and tend to use the same type of music but here I didn't feel that as the tracks are placed in specific moments that it didn't distract me or having me feel that it was cheesy. Michael Brook's score was great when it comes on but it's very rare that I do hear it due to maybe the fact that Russell might feel it may detract from the characters and having us think that it's more than what it is, well it's not and Russell doesn't want us to search for something that isn't really there.\n\nThe acting in this film is the main reason that this film is given much praise as it boasts the best performance from Christian Bale, Mark Whalberg, Melissa Leo and Amy Adams so far. I was glad to see that the Academy was able to give them credit where it was due but I was a bit disappointed to see Whalberg on not being nominated. I was amazed on Bale's transformation, just from the first shot where he appears he just looks sickly and disgusting. I was also impressed with Adams transition from her good girl characters to this tough and assertive woman who takes control of the scene every time she's on. Melissa Leo definitely was a standout in this film too who always strives for attention and to be the best in the scene, she seems to get the bets reactions from the actors therefore making the scenes much more effective. Jack McGee was really entertaining to see here, either being subtly funny or being able to add on the drama of the scene. I wish he is able to get much better roles in the future.\n\nThe Fighter so far is one of my favorite sports films of all time and also it is tied as my favorite from David O. Russell. I am glad to see Russell coming back and continues to make great films (SIlver Linings Playbook & the upcoming American Hustle).",

            "content": "Yet another great film from David O. Russell. The Fighter is about an up and coming boxer named Mickey (played by Mark Wahlberg) who is trying to make it to the big leagues or rings or whatever fuck, and is trained by his coke-head brother Dicky (Christian Bale) and feels bad when he has to do a fight without him. Mickey then gets annihilated at a match of his and has to work his way back up. This film is beautifully acted, Mark Wahlberg and Amy Adams are great, but Christian Bale is stupendously good. Watching him play Dicky Ward was almost disturbing it was so good, he BECAME Dicky. The direction is confident and stylish by David O. Russell who continues to impress me. The music is okay, it mostly consists of pop songs, but whenever the score does come into play it's fantastic. The cinematography is smooth and when it does shake it adds to the film. The editing is good, nothing really stand out here, just solid editing. The writing is damn good, especially when brought to life so well by it's great cast. I honestly have no real gripes with this film, except that Mickey's daughter is an AWFUL actress. I cringed whenever she said a line. Other than that the film was fantastic. \nOverall: Fantastic acting, great drama, and well done story that doesn't fall too far down the cliche hole thanks to Bale's character. \n\nFinal Score: 9/10",

The film works not only because of its unflinching realism but because of the performances of the primary cast; this is an exemplary work of art, a picture where the outcome of the greater plot really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. Instead, it's the arc of the characters -- no matter whether they win or lose -- that's the real area of interest, and Director David O. Russell's picture is a gem of a character study that's flat-out not only one of the best movies of its kind but one of the greats of the past decade.",

Christian Bale definitely stole the show in this movie and it really can be unsettling to see how dedicated this actor is to his roles looking at how much weight he lost. This movie is a tad predictable but since the performances are so strong, the movie holds its own in the world of sports movies. Out of the three O.
