    "summary": "When Dan Sanders (Brendan Fraser) takes a job overseeing the construction of a supposedly \"green\" housing development in the Oregon woods, he thinks his greatest challenge will be helping his urban-oriented family (Brooke Shields, Matt Prokop) adjust to country life while simultaneously trying to keep his demanding boss happy. But, when the local animals learn that Dan is in charge of their habitat's destruction, the fur flies in an all-out battle between man and nature.",

As an adult watching the film I felt he was the victim just trying to do his job. overall the humor is a bit lacking but entertaining for kids, and it is amusing to see Brendan's character go crazy from the animals, But I can really only recommend watching this for group discussion about the characters actions and decision.",
