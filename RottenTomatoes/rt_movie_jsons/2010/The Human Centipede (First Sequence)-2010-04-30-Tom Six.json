On top of that, nothing of substance even occurs for at least half of the movie; it just shows the scientist living out his dream of owning a demented pet.

Everybody thinks it's not a good movie due to the fact that it has a truly sick plot, but I cannot say that it's a bad movie just because it's sick. Just like A Serbian Film, this movie is sickly great. The story follows two best friends who, after getting a flat tire in the middle of the woods, find a house where doctor Heiter lives and does his... Experiments. Just when they thought that they were going to be saved, it all goes south when the doctor drugs them and starts preparing them for his \"human centipede\" experiment. The story does have quite a lot of cliches in it, mostly in the beginning, but as the movie goes on, you start to realise how different this movie actually is. The characters consist of a very sick, but clever, doctor Heiter who doesn't care at all for human beings and just wants to make his own creature, two best friends who aren't really developed really well and they also don't get much dialogue due to the fact that half of the movie they're in the centipede, and a Japanese man who's the head of the centipede and he's actually quite well thought of, I really loved his monologue at the end. The acting was decent, the girls I didn't find very convincing at the beginning, but as soon as the 'preparations' started, it's like they suddenly got talent for acting (maybe the fact that they didn't talk helped me in liking their acting, anyways, I liked their performance better in the second half). Dieter Laser as the horrifying doctor Heiter was the best part of the movie. He is haunting! His acting doesn't even look like acting at some points and he really seemed like a true psychopath by the end of the movie. Very believable performance. The Japanese man was also good. Again, I really liked his character and the ending monologue. The effects were great and the surgery and consquences were terrifying! It made me feel very uneasy and whenever succeeds in doing that, it has to be good. The ending of the movie is very depressing and tragic. The way things are left is eerie and just makes you think of what happened next. It was very well executed. All in all, The Human Centipede is a great horror movie that succeeds in shocking the viewer while also delivering a haunting and tragic story with a very interesting main villain and even though some of the characters make some stupid decision and the acting isn't always good, I would highly recommend checking this movie out to all horror fans.",

The hilariously named Tom Six, crafts a horror, which he claims is influence by Pasolini and other film makers of that era and ilk, the problem is that unlike a director who can take gratuitous violence and use it in an ingenious way to portray the horror of a smart subject matter, Six takes the route of glorified sadist, with a film that has no reason, no message and makes no sense what so ever. When American friends Lindsay and Jenny brake down in the German wilderness, they happen to stumble upon an insane retired surgeon, who drugs them and decides to use the girls as part of a project to connect 3 people together, ass to mouth, in order to create a centipede. There you go folks, that's your film, that is the story, nothing else, there is no higher meaning, no subtext, no meat on this bone. The script is hilariously shallow, with horrendous dialogue, made worse by subtitles, but then again what were you expecting from a man who comes up with a story quite like this? What pains the most here is the fact that not only does the film look pretty impressive visually at times, not only is the lead character actually outstanding, not only does Six craft occasional moments of tension, the biggest criminal of all rests in the fact that The Human Centipede is neither scary nor the most revolting film that exists. The only thing that Six wants to strive for and he cant manage it, leaving causal viewers disgusted but anyone who actually witnessed say Salo: 120 Day Of Sodom, slightly bored by proceedings. Centipede doesnt offend on moral terms, more on outright stupidity and its existence based solely to shock. There are occasional flurries of something sound here, however their inclusion only pains knowing that if Six could get away from being an idiot, he might actually be able to craft an acceptable horror film. It's by no means the most vile or disturbing film you will ever watch, its by no means good and it really has little to offer, which is a shame because Dieter Laser's performance and the cinematography are what horror films were made for.",

It was just weird not really anything really amazing and underlying sense that whoever made this movie likes sick porn and wanted to express that in this trash somehow, the acting is Ok its gets the job done in the film but their arent any academy award winning performances here, the cops in the film are easily the worst actors in the film, running around the house all goofy not acting anything like cops instead more like too newly hired mafia members would have been a better fit for these guys. You can watch this movie for the sheer hilarity of such a ridiculous sharknadeo in your face 2000's mindlessness era of trash movies. But Dont get me wrong in terms of trash movies I put this above alot of other trash movies sharknedo was unwatchable this movie you can watch all the way through. In terms of trash movies i give this a solid B if not A- but dont get me wrong this still is a trash movie not one that i will ever watch again but for the hiliarty of it i will watch the 2nd and 3rd sequel proving that once again trash movies can have their place in the world because of sheer boredom",

Yes, the acting is standard horror-flick fare. Yes some of the scenes are nausea-inducing. But there's 1 or 2 elements of this film that, for better or worse, actually work. I'd even go as far as to say that parts of it feel like a relatively suspenseful horror movie. Nothing fantastic, but credit where it's due, it does at least try. It tries to get us to sympathise with the characters, it tries to make the scenario seem eerily plausible, and it tries to make us see things through the eyes of the bad guy. It's far more unintentionally hilarious than it probably realises, and while the villain is downright cartoonish in his crazier moments, he's pretty intimidating when he need to be. Unfortunately things go awry around the halfway point, when the director clearly said to himself 'Right, that's enough *cough* subtlety, let's give the audience what they REALLY want!' That's when this movies reputation starts to ring true, and all the things it attempted to create and develop in the first half are diminished and even washed away altogether by a tidal wave of blood, gore and abject misery.",

I remember in high school when there were mentions of this film, and how the idea of a human centipede in and of itself was absurd. Fast forward to today and I'll admit that I was a bit surprised.\n\nThe story at the beginning is generic. Two women who annoy you with their idiocy and their \"we're in a horror movie iq\" have a flat tire and basically stumble upon Siamese twin surgeon Josef Heiter's home. Heiter, who has an unhealthy ass to face obsession, has the expertise in which to complete the experiment of creating the human centipede. \n\nAt first I liked the performance that Dieter Laser gives as Heiter the mad scientist. He has the chance to make this sick dream a reality and his sickening grin is a feature that made me uncomfortable looking at the screen (disturbing faces are perhaps my biggest fear probably because I have a hard time making eye contact with others in general).\n\nAs Heiter gathers the victims and prepares them, a psychological dread looms. This obscene and unreal experiment is taking place, and as humans we're curious of things outside the norm. We may feel bad for our protagonists, but the doctor is reveling in his magnum opus of an experiment that as an audience member I couldn't help , but yearn to see what this all was going to look like (I'm a very sick person, I know).\n\nAs the centipede awakens in its fetal position like an infant would look, it also signified a new outlook of the film for me. All of the fascination of wanting to see this freak of nature had faded and now I wanted the movie to end. It carried though and I started to take issue. Laser seemed like he was over-acting now, there at a point was no distinguishable plot, and what ended up being the climatic payoff was underwhelming. This film took a bit of a nose-dive. I may sound a little demented, but the first half was Dr. Josef Heiter's film. Then in the second half: \"oh yeah I was supposed to care about these unlikeable protagonists.\" \n\nAs the film carried, it was in my head that this film was supposedly disgusting, and at times it seemed like it. It was something that was also prominent in the 2nd half which also dragged this film. \n\nOverall, this film started to let down by the time the human centipede was created. The film became horror genre generic again in the 2nd half, and it doesn't stand out amongst horror films I've seen in the past. However, it's decent to the point that I may or may not watch its sequels in the future. We'll see.",

The premise is indeed shocking and truly horrifying, but as said by many other's it ends up being little more than torture porn.  There are some truly infuriating instances in this film where characters make horrible, albeit completely predictable, decisions. It's also rife with horror tropes: For instance, the two girls blow a tire while driving through the middle of nowhere in a foreign country.  It's a rental, mind you, so it's reasonable to assume there is a spare tire.  Both girls admit to not knowing how to change a tire, thus all but saying \"there's a spare\".  So instead of actively *trying* to change the tire they decide to try to walk to find help.  This is after they discover that OF COURSE there is no cell service.  To be fair one of the girls explains \"there's always a signal!\" So, no one can change a tire, their cell phones are not connecting and they are in the middle of nowhere in a strange land where they don't even speak the language. Now bear in mind they're in the woods, but currently on a road.  What would you do in this circumstance?  That's right, wander off into the woods!  They do just that, become hopelessly lost and then stumble upon the mad doctor's house.  Thus begins the horror.\n\nWhat saves this movie from B-rate absurdity however is the brilliant performance of Dieter Laser who plays the deranged doctor who is the villain of the film.  He pulls off creepy insanity superbly. \n\nUltimately a rather cliched film, riddled with predictable behavior and poor decisions upon the part of the characters, Human Centipede is saved from banality by one of the most sincerely disturbing villains I've ever seen.",

            "content": "I really don't usually watch films like The Human Centipede: First Sequence because I prefer my horror films to rely more on suspense than shocking visuals as a source of thrills. Also, the story in The Human Centipede: First Sequence sounds more like a joke than a legitimate film. But one day I decided to watch it for some reason. \n\nThe Human Centipede: First Sequence made for very uncomfortable viewing. As I've avoided watching any of the films in the Saw series because I am not an avid fan of torture porn which was what The Human Centipede: First Sequence was said to be. But in certain areas, I was somewhat impressed by The Human Centipede: First Sequence.\nSurprisingly, The Human Centipede: First Sequence succeeds at building tension without excessive blood and gore. Before the film reaches its midpoint and begins using all the grotesque visuals it has been recognised for, it builds up a lot of intensity by using a tense and low musical score lightly while it allows viewers to adjust to its atmosphere of empty fear which is controlled all by Dieter Laser and how Tom Six directs the film. Honestly, I'll admit it is convincing because the cinematography is very slow moving and intense, allowing the film to have thrills gradually seep into it instead of throwing them in the viewers face like with many other horror films of modern day. So at least in that area, Tom Six makes some achievement.\nHowever, once The Human Centipede: First Sequence turns into a film which rests all of its horror on visual elements, I lost the feeling of all the tension that had been built up. I had been chilled waiting for something to happen, but once it did it had become just a series of loosely jointed story dynamics relating to a sick creation in the film title and not to the insane nature of the character that created it, Dr. Josef Heiter. I know that the film is supposed to be more focused on the titular Human Centipede, but the most horror success in the film comes from that one character. Once he creates his pet, the story goes back and forth between them as well as with the investigation attempting to find the missing tourists Lindsay and Jenny, and the focus proves to constantly be shifting. The pace of the film speeds up and the story takes place in quick scenes which move somewhat speedily between each other in contrast to the earlier slow pace of the film, and so the second half is where the film lost all its potential and quality. I didn't feel thrilled anymore, I felt sick. And films that make me sick without having a good reason why annoy me, so I found myself somewhat annoyed at The Human Centipede: First Sequence. The film shows off potential in the first half but turns directionless, sickening and repetitive in its second act and loses sight of true horror cinema. And this boils down to Tom Six who wrote and directed the feature.\nTom Six succeeds at creating a sickening film by making it a realistic feature which is shocking from a visual perspective, but all the chills and thrills I felt in the first half of the film descended into disgust and a lack of entertainment. The skilful way he built the tension of the first half is gone in the second and is replaced by the torture porn qualities that many critics condemned it for. Tom Six proves that he can build an atmosphere and shock viewers, but he also proves that he cannot carry a film to the end on his own knowledge and instead turns his feature into a boring and unappealing joke. While it is convincing and clear that Tom Six has done quite a bit on a low budget, whatever psychological thrills that there could have been are replaced by a lot of screaming and scattered disgusting story dynamics which go in circles with the rare surprise until the end. Tom Six would have to actually be a pretty sadistic man to write and direct such a disgusting film, so I think there is some of him in the central antagonist Dr. Josef Heiter which is Tom Six's own creation and the real source of horror. If he had come to his senses and made the film a mix of character study of Dr. Josef Heiter and his creation then it would be smarter. But no, we are left with a film about people sewn together and ingesting each other's sh*t. Brilliant.\nAt least some benefit comes from the performance of Dieter Laser.\nDieter Laser's lead performance is a very freaky one. He is like a German Hannibal Lector who roams freely about his own compound and looks like a German Armand Assante, and frankly he himself is more scary than The Human Centipede: First Sequence itself. The film is chilling for its grotesque visual qualities, but the real fear is created by the nature of Dieter Laser's character. His performance is an intimidating one which is fearless, but I can't say the same for myself watching him. I was very fearful of him because he is the true heart of all the horror in The Human Centipede: First Sequence and his performance was actually excellent. He is the true haunting image I will take away from the film.\nAnd even though the performances of Ashlynn Yennie, Ashley C. Williams, and Akihiro Kitamura don't require much from them except a lot of screams, they still all contribute their own part to the success of The Human Centipede: First Sequence, even if it doesn't succeed in the end.\n\nBut despite a thoroughly dedicated performance from Dieter Laser which is haunting and unforgettable, Tom Six squanders the potential of The Human Centipede: First Sequence and his ability to create a strong horror atmosphere on a lot of repetitive torture porn and an indifferent ability to focus on the best aspects of the horror he has created.",

This movie is full of disturbing creepy acts such as an older doctor taking young men and women into his home to sew them up into one human centipede. Creepy huh? \n\tApparently I'm not the only one who was totally mortified by this disturbing film. Cridicts and reviews from www.CinemaBlend.com and Rottentotmatoes would support my idea on this film. CinemaBlend.com states that The Human Cenitpede was \"to be one of the most disguisting, cringe worthy pieces of film..\" that year. www.rottentomatoes.com audience of 15,262 ratings only 26% of them liked it. Also people says it was \"..more interesting to talk about than to watch or experience..\" This film is really creepy and I would not recommend this film to anyone, unless I really wanted to creep them out or scare them.",

However, I cannot deny the fact that The Human Centipede (First Sequence) was shot beautifully and often had me entertained, even if some moments were off-putting.

He was just a sick and disturbing human being who wanted to create a human centipede. The film had no meaning and was predictable. Very few elements of surprises, and extremely uncomfortable for audience members to sit through the full movie due to the over extreme and disturbing scenes.

While I thought there could be suspense in this, there really wasn't any. It was a total bonehead romp that really just has the concept of a German doctor making a human centipede and that is really it. I'm sure people will love this specifically for the shock value but I am afraid there were no real shocks or terror. The score does work at times with the dark ambiance but it is really nothing that we haven't heard before.

The 'acting' and dialogue is rough at first, but seems to find it's stride towards the mid and latter portions of the 'film'.  It would be hard to argue that it rises much above torture porn, but director Tom Six does seem to have a knack for tension building, with one specific scene involving two detectives having a particularly well crafted sense of pace and build-up. That, and an unpredictable last act, make it a step above a B movie, while still being a novelty by and large. Recommended only faintly for those with the sensibilities. \n\n3/5 Stars",

Normally, I'm more than willing to suspend disbelief for characters' behaviors, especially in horror movies, but this one stands out as a shitstorm of stupidity that just makes me think I wasted my time. I wouldn't have watched this if not for a paper, and I'm starting to think that avoiding it entirely would have been the right decision.

I'm just praying that this wasn't one of those films inspired by true events, otherwise I really worry what this world is coming to. It's all set in a remote area of Germany where two student girls are setting out on a regular night of drinking and clubbing before moving on to Italy a day or so later. Unfortunately for them, the only drink that passes their lips that evening is a glass of water laced with date rape, as they go seeking help for their broken down car. Their captor, albeit a seemingly successful surgeon judging by his mansion home, has one last operation to perform - his own human centipede creation. Despite several screams and escape attempts late, the girls along with a fellow captor are all pieced together in one digestive flow which does leave us cringing at the thought of the inevitable as we see the hostages connected via mouth to anus. Although this film is not particularly graphic, it doesn't leave a lot to the imagination and the simple thought of someone excreting into another's mouth is enough to make one gag. It's not a particularly action packed film, but will have a growing reputation simply due to its willingness to stretch the boundaries of grossing out its audience.

There are also  plot holes such as how the girls don't die of starvation or dehydration (I'm pretty sure diarrhea doesn't count as food or drink), or how the middle girl doesn't suffer from an infection, unlike her friend who is sewn to her (The infection should spread). There is no logic, to say the least. This film's only real purpose is to gross out the viewer, and for that purpose, it works.

But I chose to stick with it, because I just felt like I had to see it at least once. And with that, I don't plan to see it again. One sequel was released last year, and another will follow in 2013. According to the director, Tom Six, the third film will make the second one look like a Disney movie. That in mind, I don't intend to see either sequel. Just the thought of the first one makes me sick, so I'm more than certain I won't be able to survive even 10 seconds of the sequels. But there is nothing wrong with seeing films like this once in a while. If you like disgusting horror, I recommend you watch it at least once, but be prepared to turn it off, you may even throw up.

            "content": "I wish I could say this movie was self aware of how bad it was executed, sadly I truly think Tom Six is not only proud of this but finds it revolutionary...\n\nHere is A quote from Mr.Six himself paraphrased \"Why make movies unless they are original.\" and i respect that quote on a lot of levels...now lets review this movie.\n\nA mad doctor is kidnapping people (Totally original), in his house thats in the middle of nowhere and apparently never checked on unless of course you are a lost tourist (UNDENIABLY ORIGINAL), so he can experiment on them and make his mad vision come to life. (Most original concept ever amirite?) So generally speaking this movie kicks Tom Six's own quote in the balls, put thats fine why cant there be a good movie about a mad scientist and his whacked out brutal experiments the answer there is none, but there is a reason why it didn't work here.\n\nSix seems to have problems moving his characters out of the first dimension and this starts to show almost immediately instead of a proper prologue of some sort the film just simply begins, we are almost expected to know why this scientist is a mad scientist, and why he wants to make this human centipede.\n\nAt this point we met our (loosely put) protagonist 2 American tourists who get lost on the way to the club...apparently there are no highways in Germany, so their car gets stranded in the woods (Tom's originality once again shines in such a plot device) after not being able to get help because their cell phones aren't getting reception (there goes that loss end) they stumble into the doctors house where we begin our last 75 minutes of useless shenanigans another tourist is kidnapped off screen and brought in then seriously it plays out like every movie involving A kidnapped person ever has...and to top it off there is some Tommy Wiseau quality acting in this baby, that comparison being made there is a lot of similarities between this and Wiseau's work, id go as far as to call it, \"The Room of Horror Movies\".\n\nIts badly acted, written, directed, and just plain annoying to sit through, it doesn't even have the camp value movies like Troll 2 or Plan 9 have its just all around bad film creating...but then again Tom Six did make it.",

            "content": "Nauseating, gross and yet it's sick. The Human Centipede is one of the most disgusting movies ever made and it's really exploitative due to it's graphic content. This is a great film and the plot is about two girls who finds they're selves stranded in the middle of nowhere after having a flat tire and when the girls seek shelter from a man who lives in the woods the two girls soon discovered that he is creating the unspeakable Human Centipede and soon the girls must escape before the man name Dr. Heiter uses them both for his Human Centipede experiment. This is a great film so far although if you have a weak stomach I seriously do not recommend this movie for anyone because this movie seriously will give most movie watchers a stinky smell in the cinema due to it's graphic content and it will leave any audience a bad odor in the room and no one could possibly resist watching movies like this if anyone has a weak stomach and I seriously do not recommend this for anyone. What's great about The Human Centipede is that the film has a lot of disturbing content and the film's concept is just great and it has an exploitation feel and the whole movie feels like some weird 70's/80's exploitation movie due to it's concept and graphic sequences. There are lots of disgusting scenes in this movie and I seriously mean a lot of it. The development of the Human Centipede is just sick and disgusting and seriously from what I can tell this movie really is an exploitation Horror movie because there's a lot of disgusting scenes in this movie and seriously I think it's just great. What I also like about The Human Centipede is the film's disturbing content and there are lots of disturbing scenes in this movie. The death of the Japanese guy is sick. The scene where Jenny dies is just gross and nasty because of the three of them connected together  in the form of the Human Centipede is just plain gross and it seriously creates a bad odor in the room so far. Though the death scenes are just a few and not so gory it's still a great movie due to it's sick and disturbing content and I like the idea so far. What I also like about this film is that the movie also has a lot of tense parts. The scene where Lindsay gets chased by Dr. Heiter after escaping from her bed is really tense and I like how that scene was used a lot to create the suspense of this movie so far. The other things that fascinated me about this movie is mainly the villain's behavior and Dr. Heither is just creepy and yet he's sick and insane and thanks to Dieter Laser's performance the movie really ended becoming a success and I like how he played the role of Dr. Heiter so far and I'm hoping to see more of Dieter Laser's future films in the future as well. Now the acting is great the performances of all the new casts in this film is just great and the two girls did a good job with they're roles in the film even the Japanese guy did a good job with his role in the film as well. While the person who had the best performance in the film is Dieter Laser and I'm hoping he will have more future works in the future as well. Director and Writer Tom Six did a good job in creating his first Surgical Horror movie and I like how he handled the directing really well so far and I'm sure he will do a good job on the sequel to The Human Centipede so far. Overall The Human Centipede(First Sequence)gets a 10/10 because this movie has all of the disgusting and gross out sequences and it also has the exploitation feel as well. This movie is not for everyone it will seriously leave a bad odor in the room.",

In its principles, it may not be anything new but it is in effect timeless. It is horror of the human psyche; of human potential for anti-social depravity. Therefore it is the horror movie that is like the love songs . . . both are timeless and will never go away. Nor should they!

            "content": "After hearing so much about The Human Centipede: First Sequence, I decided to watch it and see what the fuss is all about. I've heard that it's quite disturbing and it's one of the most scariest and most sickening movies ever to have been made and I have to say, I've seen worse. There's no denying that The Human Centipede: First Sequence's idea is a tad sickening, what with the crazy doctor and the experiments he does but other than that, but it doesn't show on screen. It's the classic clichÃ© horror story of two women who have trouble when their car breaks down and so knocks on a stranger's door to make a phone call and they're drugged and knocked out. They wake up only to find this stranger is a crazy surgeon who dreams of creating creatures, he's used three Rottweilers and wants to move a step up by using humans. The plot is short and very stretched, even for a movie lasting just over the ninety-minute mark. As soon as you get past thirty minutes, it becomes rather tedious and quite slow from then on. There's not much to this movie except for the reputation it has of being a sick and twisted movie and, as I have said above, there's worse movies out there than this. The Human Centipede: First Sequence grabbed your attention at first with the first scene of the doctor kidnapping a truck driver but as soon as the two women enter the doctor's house, that was when your attention slowly started to fade and from then on, the movie started to get a little boring and even repetitive at times.\r\n\r\nThe acting is below mediocre. Dieter Laser was average as the crazed Doctor Heiter and there were a couple of good moments from him but his performance wasn't enough to save this movie from being boring. Ashley C. Williams, Ashlynn Yennie and Akihiro Kitamura, who played the three captives, were quite bad and they weren't convincing, especially before they went to the house. The writing was terrible for the characters considering you didn't care what happened to them. The two American girls were bad at acting and unconvincing of their characters. The quality of acting in this movie is something I would expect in a no-budget movie. The direction was okay but the writing was bad considering there's almost twenty minutes of unnecessary scenes  in the movie that you could easily cut out and you wouldn't miss anything. Director and writer Tom Six did create something that has quite a scary and some original thought, I'll give him that, but alas, it was the thought itself that was the only thing scary. Unfortunately, The Human Centipede: First Sequence is quite a disappointment and is not scary at all as yet again, following the trend of horror movies of today, it's in the gross-out department rather than the scare department. So, it's gross which means plenty of blood, guts and gore, right? Wrong! There's hardly any of that either. I've also heard that it's quite gory and very violent but it's not exactly that either. The violence, maybe, but it's hardly gory . The main problem with The Human Centipede: First Sequence is that it's ridiculous. Okay, the plot does sound like it was going to be completely bonkers from the beginning but it gets even more so later on in the movie and not in a good way. The idea isn't really very original except for the obvious but if you take that away, all it really is is a scientist who wants to create creatures and there's movies like that everywhere.\r\n\r\nThere's honestly nothing scary about The Human Centipede: First Sequence, it's just a gross-you-out movie that is quite disgusting. It doesn't make you jump and you won't lose any sleep over it but it will most likely gross you out, which is quite sad because you could see the potential of this being one of the scariest movies of today. True that the idea of a mad doctor creating creatures from humans by sewing them together in a vile way is quite a scary thought but the movie itself is not scary and is more disturbing with a couple of violent scenes. I think The Human Centipede: First Sequence would have been a major improvement if it was a short film, making it ninety minutes long stretched the story and plot and you could see where they made some scenes longer than they should have been because of that. I would recommend this to anybody who likes gross-out horror movies but if you're looking for something that will have you scared, this isn't the one for you. It's neither good nor bad but it's something that I couldn't watch again. This isn't because it's disgusting but because I wouldn't call it one of those movies you could watch again in time, mainly because it's too long and some of the scenes drag as well as the obvious. I thought this was enough but Tom Six has now revealed there is a sequel in the works which will be ready for 2011 and is supposed to be more disgusting than this. I didn't really think this needs a sequel, I see it being pointless but I'll wait until I've seen it. I would recommend you watch something else other than this but if you're curious about it, rent it.",

The second is how unbelievably dumb all of the people in the movie are, and it makes for some of the stupidest decisions and trains of logic ever put on film.

ItÃ¢(TM)s not like The Room, where it almost seems like they all knew it was going to be bad, this actually tried. When you try one thing and fail, it is a bad movie in that right. In another right, it could work really well, but there was thought (and I use that term very loosely) put into this. If there is one thing the film does right though is that the doctor, while camp, does genuinely seem insane. But yeah, it is not horrifying or disgusting at all; at least not to me, anyway, and winds up being a hilarious, bordering sit-com territory, film at some points.",

The surgeon kidnaps a third tourist this time a man for the front part of the centipede and is ready for his surgery. Two detectives come into his house to believe that something fishy is going on as they figured on people are missing and they arrive into his house. When they find out that he is guilty of those disappearances and one of them spots the experiment, He kills the surgeon before the surgeon kills them both. Meanwhile for the human centipede, the front body suicides believing that this is his punishment for living a selfish life and the back dies naturally as she was unable to cope with the experiment leaving the middle one alone. All of  this movie's ideas were unique, and it's one of the only films I can call it original without without cliche-ing the movie or my speech so much.

The film's writer-director, Tom Six, leaps directly to the forefront of world cinema with this masterpiece. Years from now, when people list the great geniuses of film, they will name Griffith, Chaplin, Keaton, Welles, Hitchcock, Kubrick, Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, and Tom Six.\n\nThe story, adapted from the novel by Henry James, follows the life lessons learned by two young American girls travelling in Europe, where they encounter a handsome and mysterious but brooding surgeon. The deep conversations and meditations on love, art, and philosophy that ensue are stunning.\n\nTom Six demonstrates that he is a master of subtlety and restraint with his impeccably tasteful direction. The soundtrack by John Williams adds almost unfathomable layers of deep emotion to the already incredibly involving and poignant scenes. Henry James would be so proud of the sensitive and literate work Six put into adapting the screenplay from his novel. This is truly cinema at its finest and most artistic.",

Has corny sections that make you slap your head, and makes you want to grab the characters by the throat. Does have genuine moments of horror for the characters involved, especially the middle part. If you know this movie, you know what I mean by the middle part. That character you feel genuine pity for. If a director can conjure up that emotion, guess he deserves a little cred. What is frustrating, though, is how stupid he wrote her that put her in that situation. By the way, if you have a chance to escape, leave your friend. Sound mean? Trust me, see the movie, THEN judge me. Getting to the cops insures your survival a lot more. This is another \"not for everyone\" movie...",
