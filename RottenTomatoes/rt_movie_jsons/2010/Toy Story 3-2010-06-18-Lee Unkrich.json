As someone who grew up with the original Toy Story films, I was excited to see how this third installment would fare. And boy, was I not disappointed.\n\nFrom the start, the animation quality was top-notch, with every character and detail beautifully crafted. The storyline was equally impressive, delivering a tale that was not only entertaining but also emotionally resonant. I found myself invested in the fate of Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the toys as they navigated the perils of life in a daycare center.\n\nOne of the things that impressed me the most about Toy Story 3 was its ability to balance humor and heart. There were plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, but the film also tugged at my heartstrings, especially towards the end. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the final scenes left me misty-eyed.",

            "content": "Summary:\n\tA continuation of Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3 encompasses Andy, the owner of the toys preparing to go off to college. Andy hasn't played with the toys for years, so the toys build up suspicion that he will dump them out. As he attempts to put them in the attic, the toys, except Woody, end up being donated to Sunny Side, a daycare. Delighted that they will be played with, the toys reject Woody's requisition to return to Andy, but the kids at the daycare end up being aggressive. As they plan to leave the daycare, they discover the corrupt system. Woody then returns to the daycare to save his friends. \n\nAnalysis: \nThe main theme of this movie is friendship. The toys including Jessie, Woody, Buzz and Rex have always been together and for each other. However, throughout the movie, conflict arises about Andy moving to college which separates them from each other. However, the friendship returns and aids to their rescue from the daycare and the dumpster. For example, after Lots of Huggin refused to press the button that would've saved all the toys, they became hopeless as they accepted the certainty of their death falling in the pit of fire at the dumpster and stretched their hands to each other. Despite the realization of imminent death, the toys appreciated their friendship. Soon after, the three alien kid toys came and grabbed them and saved them from being burned. This scene is significant evidence of the theme of friendship. It showed to the audience how sticking together and believing in each other is a beautiful thing. It shows how friendship is a key factor in life. \n\tToy Story 3 also sends a message throughout the movie. It shows to the audience that everyone grows up and moves on, but the little events in someone's life are always apparent. Andy has not played with his toys for years, and as he came to throw his toys away, he hesitated and wanted to put them in the attic, except Woody, with whom he holds a great deal of memories. He places him in the college pile. Although Andy realizes he doesn't need these toys anymore, at the last scene of the movie as Andy decides to give those toys to Bonnie, he sees Woody in the box and hesitates to let him go. But he does, and then plays with Bonnie. Him playing with the toys for the last time in a while reflects on his love for them, but also on moving on.\n\nCritique:\nThe strengths of this movie are for sure more than the weaknesses. The movie can communicate to the viewers the emotions of every character with each conflict and event. The plot supports the main theme of the movie. Acknowledging that this movie stands out for kids the most, the movie did a great job of sending positive messages, educating the kids on the concept of moving on and entertaining the kids with the different plot twists and the overcoming of the obstacles that came in the way of the toys. It is exciting and fulfilling for kids. \nThe weaknesses of this film are directed towards the logical concepts but are not too significant since this is a kid's movie. One of them is the trendy contradiction of the strength of these toys. For example, the toys could not easily move the garbage plastic bag having almost 8 toys inside yet were able to move a tv in the dumpster scene. Also, it made no sense that Woody was able to leave the daycare so easily in the beginning of the movie seeing no guards or obstacles except being seen by humans while as the other toys tried to escape, they faced multiple levels of security Lots of Huggin had installed. Another thing is the daycare. The kids, when inside the daycare, play with the toys, and then they are called to go outside to also play. In most daycares, there are certain systems and educational lessons for these kids at daycare. \nDespite the criticism above, I would rate this movie a 4.73 out of 5.",

But what makes this memorable, and what has always made Pixar stand out, is its enormous heart. The emotional connection we've developed with Woody, Buzz, and the gang pays off in starling and sometimes scary ways. There are moments here that will have your heart racing and your eyes watery. The ending is a beautiful coda for this fantastic film series, reminiscent of the opening dialogue-free montage in 'Up'. The filmmakers say this is the end, and it feels like it. But they should be proud of the legacy they've left behind with these wonderful films. With this one they've ensured a classic franchise, and not only is this one of the best films of the summer, it's one of the best films of 2010",

            "content": "To me, Pixar have never yet made a bad film, even their weakest Cars is actually very good. Like a lot of people here, I grew up with and loved the first two Toy Story films and still love them. As is consistently the case with Pixar they are superbly animated, sophisticated and had great characters. Toy Story 3 somehow managed to do the seemingly impossible, while its Toy Storys 1 and 2 have a special place in my heart, this film was even better.\n\nPerhaps Toy Story 3 isn't the most original of the trilogy or of the Pixar films, but that made little difference to me. While the darkest of the three, it still maintained the predecessors' heart and charm, and overall it was just an amazing film full-stop from start to finish, and easily one of the best of the year.\n\nThe animation is just superb here. Hardly a surprise though, as the animation was phenomenal also in Toy Storys 1 and 2, but to me it was just as sophisticated and as colourful here if not more so. I also loved the music, that said I don't think it is the best Pixar score(Up) or best score of the year, but it is almost certainly one of Randy Newman's better efforts and I liked the You've Got a Friend in Me repeat.\n\nThe pacing is just fine as well, and the story is tremendously engaging with plenty of humorous, tense, exciting and genuinely affecting scenes. The ending especially resonated with my entire family, especially my brother, while the scene in the dump is for me Pixar's most intense scene.\n\nI was also delighted with the film's script. The dialogue was always witty and sharp, none of it felt forced in any way. There was the brilliantly judged humour- Buzz speaking Spanish was just one of the highlights and the beginning alone had about 5 or 6 laughs- and also the poignant parts that avoided being overly-sentimental and mawkish.\n\nAnother strength is in the characters. All the main characters are as likable as ever, Woody is still determined, Buzz is a sheer delight, Jessie(though I actually like her) is more tolerable here and Mr Potato Head is hilarious. But the new characters are just as wonderful, the baby is both creepy and cute and I felt for him at the end, the cymbal monkey especially for that shriek is one of Pixar's scariest characters, Lotso looks cuddly but is actually shady and bitter with an unrelenting past and Ken is cool without being bland or annoying.\n\nAs ever, the voice work is brilliant from all involved, not just from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen but also from Ned Beatty whose crusty demeanour fitted Lotso like a glove.\n\nIn conclusion, a truly brilliant film and a fitting conclusion to an amazing trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The last couple of Pixar movies have been some of my personal favorites, with Cars more suiting as a guilty pleasure than anything else. However, I think Toy Story 3 is better than all of those films by a good bit.  First, the story and plot. It's a prison break movie, which I'm already a sucker for. Combine that with the Already great storytelling of Pixar, and you have a chefs kiss for it! Next, the villain. Lotso is probably the best Pixar baddie since Syndrome. He has a great backstory, and for the majority of the film, he wins, which is kind of insane. Now, let's talk about the animation: it's perfect, not too much to talk about there. And the ending, OMG the ending! It's such a great way to end the movie.  If I had to nic pic one thing, it's probably the plot line of making Buzz a space ranger again, that seemed a little lazy. But that means we got Spanish Buzz, the funniest part of the film, so it doesn't affect the quality of the movie at all. The question really is is this the best Toy Story film? To me at least, I like the second more, the sole reason being that I like the characters introduced in that one better than this one. Not to say the new characters are bad in anyway, but are they going to leave as big an impact as Jessie or Bullseye? Yeah, me neither. This is a great film, and a perfect way to end this franchise….too bad they made another one, but that's for another review. Go to Disney+ and watch the next perfect Pixar flick!",

I also like the idea of a prison break out of a summer camp. And I also really like how they keep on bringing memorable new characters. And the ending of the film does put you on the edge of your seat. However even though I like the ending of this movie  I think it would've been better if it had a tighter good bye to Andy.

            "content": "A Perfect Tale of Adventure and Devotion\nSince I felt none of the other reviews here do the movie justice, I became compelled to write my own. It is the most inspired film I have ever encountered.\n\nThe creators of Toy Story 3 have an imagination that is unparalleled. I cannot begin to compare any of the other animated movies that I have ever seen to it. It is a fantasy in an unconventional sense: aside from the talking toys, the environment and settings are typical; commonplace. Yet, the Pixar Team manages to cram every last drop of energy into the incredibly clever story and inventive plot devices out of just common household objects. The animation is so brilliant that it captures shading, lighting, and textures that have yet to be seen on film.\n\nThen, Toy Story 3 becomes a beautiful elaboration on the first two, with very clever character development. Its maturity of relationships is concise but witty: Woody, the wise sheriff, leading the other toys with courage and finesse; a spaceman winning the love of a cowgirl; the loyalty of the dog, slinky; the grumpy married potato and his devoted wife; the superficial relationship of Ken and Barbie; the broken spirit of a lost teddy bear. At the same time, Pixar uses a metaphor that is so strong that it drives the audience to love these characters with all of their hearts. It is a similar emotional complex to a happy puppy who is brought into a home and has nothing on its mind but playing with its youthful owners. But these toys never age, and as its owners, once in their playful youths, leave for work and college, these toys still know nothing more than their youth and happiness of living to one day play again. As you leave for work every morning, your dog doesn't know where you go. And every day, he does nothing more than pray that you come back to see him, every day waiting for you to bring out the ball again for a game of fetch.\n\nFinally comes Pixar's ability to integrate so many emotions - fear, love, action, and comedy, among others - with each having so much vigor in its own right, that the movie becomes a roller coaster of animation and adventure, wound together by the constant movement of setting and storyline, always keeping the audience guessing on what might happen next. It is a brilliant tale; a perfect movie for children and adults alike. I cannot wait to see it again.",

With it being toys vs toys, it just feels like a normal movie instead of having the magic of them being toys contending with not being noticed in reality.\n\nAnd the punishment of boss baddie feels super religious: as if we witness his sentencing to hell.\n\nLike I said, good movie, will watch again: it's just not the previous movies.",

Constantly putting you down, this dark movie shows a facet of Toy Story that frankly should've remained hidden, not a kids movie and certainly not a toy story film. Plus, you know who doesn't recognize Toy Story 3? Toy Story 4, which after the initial scene shows exactly how the end of the movie was reached and totally skips through the unnecessary evil and cruelty of this so called \"kids movie\". Wouldn't recommend, stay away from this if you're showing your kids the toy story saga and skip through to the much better Toy Story 4 movie.",
