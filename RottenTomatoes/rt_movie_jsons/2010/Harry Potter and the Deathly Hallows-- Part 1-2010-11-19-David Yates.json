Voldemort's Death Eaters have seized control of the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts, and they are searching for Harry -- even as he and his friends prepare for the ultimate showdown.",

Where the film falls down is that perhaps more could be made of the stuff that Ron listens to on the radio - the things that the main characters cannot see, but only hear about. But perhaps that would have involved too much terror for a younger audience.  This is the first film for the main characters not to venture to Hogwarts and it brings a completely different feel to the film that benefits the evolution of the story greatly.",

I liked the part when they infiltrated the Ministry of Magic for the horcrux, when Harry finds the sword of gryffindor in the pond and him seeing the patronus, the story of the Three Brothers and the Hallows, how dark and disturbing Hermione's torture was (which you can't help but cringe at which means that the movie does it's job well), how they handled the death of Dobby, and the overall cinematography. David Yates and all of the cast yet again do great with the story and script that they were given!",

            "content": "The end begins with this next-to-last chapter of Harry Potter's big screen journey. The producers decided to split the seventh and last book in J.K. Rowling's into two films, with the final one to be released next summer. The decision proves pointless beyond the obvious cash incentive, but director David Yates and his cast and crew have still delivered a handsome, involving adventure. And if it doesn't rank among the very best in the series, it's not because everyone involved doesn't give it their all. The cast continues to be marvelous, with young Daniel Radcliffe as testy and edgy as ever. Rupert Grint has never been better, and the glowing Emma Watson reinforces that she may be the one with the most promising career beyond this franchise. The A-list supporting cast of Britain's finest character actors continues to class things up--Ralph Fiennes makes a perfectly reptilian villain, Helena Bonham Carter is his devilish equal, David Thewlis, Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans, Robbie Coltrane, Brendan Gleeson, and Alan Rickman all make an impression. Yates, of the previous two Potter films, brings a nice balance to the proceedings, sprinkling in wit and humor among the thrilling chases (brilliantly cut) and touching moments. The effects are spot-on and the film is photographed with skill. Alexandre Desplat's score is splendid at capturing the right tone when needed. The pace is uneven though, as the energy flags from time to time. The best moment? A lovely CGI shadow puppet vignette that tells us what the Deathly Hallows are. The pervasive darkness and lack of much fun can't allow this to make the \"very best of\" list for this series. But so much of what has made this series terrific--the cast, the thrills, the magic, the sentiment--can still be found in this exceptional movie",

            "content": "Just for the record, I love the books(for a while Philosopher's Stone was a huge favourite of mine) and I personally like the films. None of them are masterpieces, but they are likable, entertaining and I think well made too. I saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 with high expectations, there were many friends of mine who said it was brilliant and the best yet. After seeing it with my family last night I have to say Amen! This was a wonderful film in my opinion, and it does a very good job sticking to a mammoth story. I also think they made the right decision splitting it into two parts, if they hadn't the result I think would have been too rushed.\n\nIf I do have a criticism here, I do agree that the pacing is rather slow. I think it started and ended brilliantly, it was the middle where it dragged with a lot of admiring the scenery. As beautiful as it was, it didn't admit much to the story.\n\nCriticism aside, I adored the production values. The darker scenes were indeed dark and somewhat bleak, especially the beginning at Malfoy Manor where it looked like a film noir, while the scenery in the middle of the film was gorgeous. The music was another delight, it was sweeping, grandiose, majestic, for me the most complex and most atmospheric of all the Harry Potter movie scores. The script is an improvement too, not that it was terrible in the other movies, but especially I thought the humour was better judged(ie. Moody's comment about the polyjuice potion), while the story despite the slow pacing was never less than engrossing.\n\nThere are a few scenes too that I especially liked. One was Dobby's death, I thought it was heart-rending. Dobby was so lovable and funny, and in this instalment cute too I think(loved the trainers), although I knew it was going to happen I couldn't help shedding tears. I think what got me were his last words, they were so poetic and touching. Another was Godric's Hollow, like the former I knew it was coming but it was done in an atmospheric and unnerving way I couldn't help jump. I was also taken with the first \"obliviate\" scene, the regret in Hermione's face and voice made it incredibly poignant, while the 7 Potters chase was both funny and thrilling. My favourite though was the Three Brothers animated sequence. I was wondering how they were going to do that, and after seeing that scene I have to applaud the writers. It was a clever and beautifully done sequence, with some haunting images especially with death. Harry and Hermione's dance got mixed reactions in the cinema, some thought it was awkward and others like me liked it, at that one I thought they were going to kiss which I don't think would have gone down well.\n\nYates's direction is also much better than it has been. It wasn't bad in the other two films, but here it looked as though he took real charge, and all the pivotal scenes here were in general wonderfully handled. The acting is mostly very good. Daniel Radcliffe is likable enough, and Rupert Grint has great comic timing. Emma Watson I think gives her best performance of the series so far and she steals every scene she's in, while Alan Rickman while not in much is deliciously suave and dour. The two standouts for me were Helena Bonham Carter, whose Bellatrix was powerful and sometimes even scary and Ralph Fiennes who was really quite creepy sometimes without saying much at all. Bill Nighy's Scrimgeour is good but not as memorable, while I do think they wasted the Dursleys.\n\nOverall, a rock solid film that ended in a perfect place and my personal favourite of the series so far. In fact, it makes me all the more excited for the next. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Dark and difficult times are here. Playtime is over for the Harry Potter characters, and the end has begun. Of course dark times are now upon the Harry Potter series, after the tragic ending in The Half-Blood Prince evil is now everywhere, nowhere is safe, and who can and can't Harry trust. This is not your typical Harry Potter story where it's another challenging year at Hogwarts. This time the film means business. The Deathly Hallows Part 1 is an amazing epic, the likes of which most Harry Potter's films haven't reached. It's almost on the same caliber as The Lord of the Rings. Also note this is the first Harry Potter film since Goblet of Fire that I am giving a four star review to, that says a lot! I've hailed Goblet of Fire as my favorite of the Harry Potter series, but I must say that I didn't expect to give another Harry Potter film a four star review, and I didn't expect this to become my new favorite Harry Potter film. I was truly blown away with full amazement with this film. This time Harry, Ron and Hermione are fleeing for their lives from the dark Lord Voldemort and his evil agents. People we've seen throughout the series are dying and are being tortured. Voldemort is everywhere and has even infiltrated the Ministry of Magic. Harry Potter has been made public enemy number one. A new school year has begun at Hogwarts, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione have been forced into exile and in search of the missing Horcruxs (the objects Voldemort has place a piece of his soul into). However, Harry is finishing Dumbledore's mission of destroying Voldemort, a task that Dumbledore spend the majority of the Potter series trying to solve. Now, Harry and his friends are left to solve the missing pieces, a highly difficult task, since they have little to no clue as to where to look. This is a highly suspenseful film. However; the film isn't built so much on it's suspenseful action scenes, but on it's characters, more than ever before. So many of the scenes in the film are driven by the connection between Harry and his friends, because all they really have right now is each other. I for one am very pleased with the decision to split up the final film into two parts. Films like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, scramble to fill in as much of the book into a 2 and a half hour or three hour film. I don't think too many fans can complain about The Deathly Hallows not staying close to the book, since the film feels like your actually being told the WHOLE book. We see almost every character of the past Potter films and see all the conclusions there are before the curtain finally drops. We also get scenes that clearly would've been cut just to make room for the final battle at the end of film had it been just one part instead of two. When Harry and pals are searching for horcruxs, they're searching for months. You get a strong taste of that feel by having the screen take it's time to show this tiring task. With so many scenes being able to take there time, you never get the feel of the story being rushed at all, something that most of the Potter films felt like at one point or another. Amazingly enough these scenes are not the least bit dull or sluggish. These scenes are carried by the relationship Harry has with his friends, especially Hermione. There is one very charming scene in particular where the two of them, after months of searching and thinking, Harry turns up the radio, grabs Hermione hand and dances with her. They embrace, not as lovers, but as two friends who have been by each other's side since age 11. It's moments like these that make the film truly rich and unique. The Death Hallows Part 1 has almost the strongest performances from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and especially Emma Watson than compared to all the other Harry Potter films. Or at least their best acting since Goblet of Fire. As I said earlier this is not the typical Harry Potter film, and I really dig that about The Death Hallows Part 1. I have been on the sidelines with David Yates since the so-so impression I got of him after seeing Order of The Phoenix. He was getting better with Half-Blood Prince, but now I am fully on board with him being the guy to direct the final Harry Potter films. The Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a richly beautiful film to marvel at, even with all the tragedy and death surrounding the story. Absolute outstanding cinematography from Eduardo Serra (Blood Diamond, Girl With A Pearl Earring, What Dreams May Come), who's cinematography really aids the film in standing out as from all the other Potter films. Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves have very genuinely adapted J.K. Rowling's finale into a glorious piece of storytelling. I especially loved the scene where the story of the Deathly Hallows is told by what I can only describe as shadow puppets cast on a cave wall. This is a very intense PG-13 film, and the most intense of all the Harry Potter films, but the film has more than enough room for fun and laughs. Shockingly I laugh more during The Deathly Hallows Part 1 than I did through most of the other Harry Potter films, but a lot of this is due to the fact that with this being the most intense of the series we need that laugh to make it through the series most darkest hours. Goblet of Fire marked the point where the time of innocence was soon coming to an end. Now there is no more innocence left in in the world of Harry Potter within The Deathly Hallows Part 1. Something shown very strongly in the film. It's all or nothing from this point on forth. For me, this is the first Harry Potter film that I felt was truly epic. Harry Potter has stepped out of it's comfort zone and is deep in hostile waters, in a Part 1 that ends with a feeling that we will being heading into a very promising Part 2 just months away. One of the year's best and strongest films! (Four out of Four Stars)",

Not only was it by far the least-entertaining, the section of the book this covers was rather poorly written, and them splitting it in two left far too much time for scenes that weren't as good as the second-act scenes of the rest of the series had been. Without the structure of Hogwarts a lot of the scenes felt written for the sole purpose of tying up character arcs -- it would've been illogical to hold a big wedding when there were practically still warm corpses laying about and it didn't make sense for Voldemort not to be in Malfoy Manor or quickly summoned there when they identified Harry's friends. That scene and the finding of Gryffindor's sword felt like deus ex machina in that their way out of the mess was far too convenient and unlikely. Dumbledore obfuscating the clues Harry would use to locate Horcruxes to the point he risks them not being found at all doesn't withstand scrutiny either; obviously he needed to keep the information secure, but he would've thought of a more practical way... in the very first movie he bewitched a mirror so that only a person with good intentions would get the stone by looking at it, for example. Nearly all the character development in this half is dark & they spent a little too much time visually flirting with ruining Ron & Hermione's budding romance. Also, they could've chosen a more cinematic way to interpret the book stranding the trio in the woods multiple times and the film score was unmemorable, though not as poorly done as HP5's. They at least did a good job setting up the finale by getting all of the boring parts out of the way, and I cannot dislike any movie with this much emotional investment, no matter how poorly it pays off in this particular instance.",

Like wtf happened to the pacing? It's like it just gave up. One minute you're riding on the back of a dragon and then the next you're listening to someone talk about someone... talk about someone. This movie had a lot of great things going for it and then waste it as soon as they get out of act 1. And don't even get me started on the whole conflict between Harry, Hermoine and Ron. It feels so useless and unearned. It's literally a conflict for the sake of conflict. It isn't growth for anyone and it's on the boarders of character assassination for Ron. Like when they aren't all acting like assholes, the movie is actually able to move forward. The plot begins to progress and everything feels right again. But damn it if that feeling doesn't take a long time to appear. But yeah, as you can probably tell, that \"conflict\" is my biggest problem with the story. Well, that and pacing, but at least that doesn't make you gag. Other than those two things, the movie actually quite good. It's what I wanted in teh Half-Blood Prince that I didn't get.

Yes, it is filled with some intense moments, but can the exciting moments fill in the boring gaps in it? I believe it can't! The boring parts are seem (mildly as I can put it) extended! The boring gaps leads (if I'm to be honest) nowhere? The break-in in the Minsitry of Magic was less impressive than I thought it was; there are some (lots) of errors and unfortuneatly, I can't ingore the errors for the boring parts make it hard not to forget about the errors! But rather than that, well, this movie is a good to see and a good HP sequel! It may not satisfied TRUE HP fans but can at least content them to the Second Part in the Deathly Hallows! Part 1 of the end is a fine, boring movie to see!",

Harry (Danielle Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) are on the run and in search for horcruxs and how to destroy them. \n\nThis is another great film. Right from the beginning you feel how dark and dangerous the world has become as we get a really intense scene where Harry is being transported to the Weasleys. That sense of dark is great and continues throughout the film as the trio come to understand that they are essentially alone. \n\nThe film has some amazing cinematography. David Yates did an extremely good job of capturing the tone from the books and applying it in this film. Particularly the scene where Harry and Hermione visit the grave of Harry's parents you can feel the emotional impact and it's amazing.\n\nOne of my favourite moments in the entire franchise is the scene where Harry try's to cheer up Hermione. It is a beautiful moment that shows the connection that these two characters have.\n\nIn terms of gripes it's slow, a lot of the film follows them as they search for answers on how to destroy these horcruxs and it isn't paced well. Dobby (Toby Jones) death scene isn't overly emotional to me. I had the same issue when they killed off Sirius, neither character was overly developed so the emotional impact isn't as strong as it could have been. \n\nOverall this film is great, as the darkness and urgency is slowly climbing we can feel that the end is coming soon. \n\n8.5/10",

Despite the slower pace, (much of the film revolves around our three protagonists trying to figure out how to destroy the horcrux, while hiding out, camping in the middle of nowhere) the characters are so likable, and fully fleshed out, that I didn't really mind one last chance to slow down and spend time with them before the final battle. I really do recommend watching this and the final Harry Potter film back to back, as they are part of one story. The ending is a cliffhanger, and doesn't give any resolution.",

            "content": "Well, we're on to the final battle between Harry and Voldemort, though somehow, despite the six preceding films and a forthcoming Part Two, it feels a little too soon. How can something still seem abrupt when it's been developing for almost ten years? One way, which I consider largely responsible in this case, is to procrastinate about developing the big bad. Voldemort enjoys an appropriately in-depth history in the books, though even there he moves in the shadows and rarely appears in the flesh, but in films he's been almost an afterthought. A victim of the constant trims and clips that have leeched depth from the print editions for years. I always figured they'd get around to him eventually, but now we're in the endgame and named characters are dying and it's quickly become clear that we aren't going to get much more insight than \"no nose / killed parents / generally mean guy.\" Which is odd, considering how much care and effort went into defining and expanding the story's huge, diverse supporting cast.\n\nAnother problem is the whole loom, doom and gloom aspect of this climax, a storm which has been gradually gathering for the last several chapters. Where the first year or two were whimsical and colorful, resonant with talking portraits and leaping chocolates, the mood has turned decidedly gray as Harry's class has aged into young adulthood. A tonal shift is to be expected - after all, isn't everyone a little depressed and melodramatic in their teens - but there's no relief in Deathly Hallows 1. It's a hundred fifty minutes of relentlessly dim, trudging melancholy, completely tired and emotionally flat. Night is always darkest before the dawn and all that, but just a little flash of optimism would go a long way in this regard, especially as the original material's been awkwardly split in two so the credits roll at the base of a steep downward slope. Man, does this movie beat you up.\n\nHarry Potter 7's technical work represents a new high water mark for the series, delivering all sorts of crazy, large-scale, wand-based battle scenes and grim, haunting locales, so it's got that going for it. The acting is generally strong, too, with Ralph Fiennes stealing the limelight as the effectively slimy, paranoid antagonist. There's just no getting past the crushing, invasive dullness of it all, nor the odd transposition of a few light-hearted themes and characters into that deep, dark new atmosphere. One scene, in particular, is like watching Jar Jar Binks get the tear-jerking \"Bubba in Forrest Gump\" farewell treatment. Sorry to say, but for all its promise and fanfare, this just wasn't very good.",

This is a film that is very, very somber, amazingly faithfully foreboding and vicerally draining of hope, as you feel the weight of the burden these three carry and are sacrificing for whilst  running out of time.

Most events felt underdeveloped and unfinished, having no real pay off, because they needed to fit so much into this film, for Part 2 to work the way they wanted it to.

When Yates went off the source material, that's where the film takes it's dips. The stuff he throws in, just feels like unnecessary filler, because it has no real meaning to what's going on. Other than that, David Yates managed to stay fairly true to the source material, creating a nice mystery, with great stakes, and a really intriguing adventure. The pacing of the film as fine at first, then became more of a slowburn film, and it threw off the excitement this film had to offer. The tone Yates set was probably one of the darkest, and unsettling yet, almost having a slight horror vibe.\n\nIf you love all of the characters of Harry Potter, you're going to have a good time with this film! David Yates incorporates a decent amount of team chemistry, but really focuses on individual motives, and it helped drive the film. The villains are now a huge presence in the films, and they're all utilized in a great way, keeping the tention and stakes high at all times. The only issues I had with some of the main characters, there were some forced conflicts and drama, that dragged on for too long, while having some inconsistencies with some of the motives.\n\nThe magic and action of the film was so much fun! There were countless enjoyable sequences, where you can feel that the teams, both, behind, and in front of the camera, are feeling extremely comfortable with their abilities to perform.\n\nOverall, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, has their fair share of issues, but there was just enough enjoyable moments to keep this film afloat.\n\n*stand alone rating- 6/10*",

            "content": "This is the most underrated film in the series in my opinion, I greatly enjoy this film each time I see it and I know that is an unpopular opinion. This film has a different tone than the rest of the series and taking our three main leads on a quest by themselves outside of Hogwarts is a very refreshing change of location and gives us time to develop these characters as much as possible before the impending war. Daniel Radcliffe has improved once again and I cared for his character emotionally, but Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are both on a higher plane of acting talent because they give great performances and really give a lot of time to strengthen the relationships that these characters share with one another. I love that this last book was split into two parts, there is so much stuff that happens and this decision allows for the finale to not be rushed but rather take its time where it needs to set up this epic finale, and that's a complaint I hear a lot, that this movie is just a big set up for the real year seven in the next film, but I think that these two films work together very well as companion pieces to the same book. This first part allows us to dive right into the minds of our main characters and feel what their feeling emotionally inside and it is a good character study. The action sequences were done very well, David Yates really stepped up his game and the direction he gives this film is excellent, the tone, the colors, and music all make you feel very somber and dreary because Voldemort is taking over everywhere and it becomes a very dark time to live in and you genuinely feel that as you watch this film. The entire first act is pretty fast-paced with the seven Harrys, Bill's wedding, and the cafe fight, but my favorite part of this film is when they infiltrate the Ministry of Magic and we see Umbridge again, it was very exciting and Ron got into character way too much which is awesome to see. After they get the locket though, the next second act and the first half of the third act slows down considerably and we get that great emotional bonding with our three leads, I know many people say that the locket was a copy of Lord of the Rings, it doesn't feel like a ripoff to me but more of an homage, it worked well in this world and led to some great intense sequences of great dialogue between our characters. I enjoyed seeing Godrics Hollow and learning more about not just Harry but Dumbledores life as well, which is another praise I have for this story, Harry and his friends are all on their own, every other movie had Dumbledore telling him everything he needed to do and helped him do it, but we get to see the maturity and intellect of Harry put to the test as we journey with him to find all of the Horcruxes. I loved how they showed us the story of the three brothers, the art style was great and the story was riveting and it helped show us how dangerous the Hallows really are. The ending picks up the pace as we go to Malfoy Manor and have a small fight in which Dobby dies and I must say, I was emotionally affected by his death more than Dumbledores and Sirius' deaths, I cried so much because he was cute and very likable and his death was done right. All in All, this is one of my favorite Harry Potter films with some great direction, great emotional explorations of our characters, it is warranted the two parts because they make a lot of progress and it doesn't feel like set-up, David Yates direction was good, the CGI was used sparingly, it has fun fast-paced sequences as well as the thoughtful slow-paced ones, and Dobby's death was a great way to end this movie. I really think that this film is underrated and should be higher on many people's lists because this was part one of a finale done right.",

People now have to watch this so they can understand what transpired before the final film. Instead of combining Part 1 & 2 for a larger finale, it was decided to squeeze the series for a bit more cash.\n\nThe end result of the above process is a film with a few interesting parts and a ton of filler. There's a lot of drag in this one that could have been cut out.\n\nOf course, as usual with Potterverse films, there's action, comedy, etc. But this film awkwardly transitions from months at a time to days.

            "content": "A dull walk through the forest.\n\nDavid Yates had the unenviable task of adapting J.W. Rowling's worst novel yet with his dreary and dull dark fantasy adventure film Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part I (2010) as it's so derivative of other fantasy works that it's embarrassing. Yates' direction is uninspired and bland for a movie building up to a finale. It certainly feels like this movie is all filler to just set up for the last film and that's it. All the pale running through the woods that drags down the middle of this movie feels right out of Twilight. Eduardo Serra's shaky cinematography is ugly and washed out for a hideous feel throughout whether it's a goofy wide shot or an awkward close-up shot. Stuart Craig's production design has neat Gothic choices for Malfoy's mansion, but ugly plain ideas for the tents and forest backdrops.\n\nIt's a confusing and boring mess. Whether characters are randomly being introduced and forgotten or people just mope out in the wilderness, this feels less like a magical Harry Potter adventure, and more like a horrid camping trip you're being forced to go on just to get somewhere better later. I don't know how anyone enjoyed this one as it's easily the worst Harry Potter movie.\n\nDreadfully slow pace with few magical moments as the viewer is treated to Yates' creative direction for a single animated story about The Deathly Hallows, meanwhile the rest of the film is dreary and bleak for the sake of appearing mature. It's just depressing for 146 minutes. It feels the length for sure. Mark Day's editing is nowhere to be seen as every scene drags on too long for a mind numbing pace with too few cuts for once. Little is explained as Day opts to just give us the basics of the story in a strangely edited fashion. Jany Temime's costumes have cool contemporary outfits for Hermione, but the rest look rather ordinary for a movie about wizards.\n\nFurthermore, Alexandre Desplat's score has a few inspired moments, but is so rarely present as the majority of scenes pass by with mostly ambient noise and a bit of dialogue. I can barely remember his music for this one. Normally, Desplat's scores are enchanting and magical, but never less so for this wizard picture's score, sadly. A more resounding score could have helped the pace and feel of The Deathly Hallows - Part I.\n\nI think J. K. Rowling's writing got too dark for her own good. Killing off characters left and right to appear more mature and serious is an obvious attempt at matching her growing audience's desire for dark stories. I think people could have used some magic and warmth instead as this feels less like Harry Potter and more like Twilight or The Hunger Games with tedious love triangles and Steve Kloves' awkward dialogue. \n\nI must say the greatest weakness of this film is the reliance on Ron's jealousy of Harry thinking he likes Hermione here. It's such a strange choice as we just spent the entire last film showing that Harry loves Ginny and Ron knows that. Rowling just forgot her own characters as Ron is more unlikable and mean than ever. Hermione deserves better and gets some sweet moments with Harry like them dancing to comfort one another in these dark times. So alongside Yates' weakest direction is Rowling's misguided concepts and Steve Kloves' awkward script.\n\nIn all, I never liked this Harry Potter film and it still doesn't hold up well despite a few nice moments.",

Yes this is just them setting up part.2 as this is more on the story than anything else, and I really enjoy it. This is a well made film.... easily the best part of this film was the 3 brothers story, the way it was animated along with Emma Watson calmly storytelling voice narration really brought something fresh to the HP franchise. I love Emma's and Daniel's chemistry throughout this film as its mainly focus on them for majority of the film, the dance scene really showed how their friendship has changed since the beginning. I think what people might complain with this movie is that the fact the lighting is keeps getting darker each film, but it helps to set up the tone for this film which pays of in my opinion. Their is some cool action scenes, like the 7 Harry escape, big fan of that especially. However, there are times where the story just slows down and it doesn't pick up the pace for quite a while..... oh and did they have to (SPOILER) break our hearts with Dobby's death???? I know this was in the book, but the way it was transferred to the screen is even more sad to see.... Here lies a free elf......\nBring on Part.2!",

            "content": "The last book in the Harry Potter saga has been split into two parts. At first, maybe people would think it is to squeeze some more financial mileage out of the series. On the other hand, having watched this installment, there is simply too much complex storytelling involved in this book to cram it into only one two and half hour movie.\n\nThis Part 1 is already a very full two and half hours. The drama begins even before the opening credits roll. The special effects have reached a new high point with the trick of using polyjuice potion to create multiple Harry's. The frenetic escape of Harry in Hagrid's motor sidecar is an achievement in action editing. The trio's penetration of the Ministry of Magic to get the locket horcrux is very exciting and tension-filled.\n\nMomentum dips a bit in the midsection as our trio scour the English wilderness for a way to destroy the horcrux. This prolonged section, which some may find boring, dealt more with the personal relationships loyalty of the three friends as challenges are thrown their way. The segment is marked by the hard-to-watch bloodlust of Bellatrix Lestrange and the nobility of Dobby. Watch out too for a most unexpected dance scene which will surely make you smile, if not actually chuckle!\n\nIn the third section, we learn what the \"deathly hallows\" are referred to in the title as our trio learns it from Xenophilius Lovegood. But the main highlight here is a most amazing animated short featurette called \"The Tale of Three Brothers\" as narrated by Hermione. This Part 1 ends very well with a sky-splitting final cliffhanger sequence.\n\nIts been repeatedly mentioned how the main actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have all grown up in front of our eyes as this movie series unfolded. Rupert and Emma are both taller than Daniel already! Acting-wise, everyone had likewise improved very much. They all even show some skin here. Yes, even Hermione! The support from the esteemed gallery of British actors and actresses serve the film very well indeed. We saw everyone from all the previous films it seems, except for Maggie Smith.\n\nThe direction of David Yates is excellent as he did in the last two films. Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves got just the proper mix of action, drama and humor needed to make the saga work on screen. This may just be a set-up installment, however, it stands very strong on its own merits. As the last scene faded to black, the audience will definitely develop the resolve to watch out for the concluding part to be released next summer, and witness the epic Battle of Hogwarts.A sullen Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) sets the mood for this seventh and penultimate instalment of Harry Potter. \"These are dark times, there's no denying,\" he intones gravely, pointing out the grim state of affairs facing the nation- murders, disappearances and raids- but reassuring the public, as any politician would, that his Ministry has it all under control. Of course, he is only bluffing, and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise. \n\nWelcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter, one that began with wonder and joy, but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore, Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore- to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes (accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul). It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. \n\nThere are fewer and fewer allies around- even those within the Order of the Phoenix may have since betrayed their ranks- and the first half hour quickly establishes the danger and urgency of the situation at hand. Members of the Order, including Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), attempt to escort Harry to safety- but even that mission is met with an attack from the Death Eaters, culminating in a dizzyingly exciting high-speed flying-bike chase that shouldn't disappoint fans looking for some action sorely missed in the last movie. \n\nIndeed, naysayers who think David Yates doesn't know how to stage thrilling action sequences should think again, as he demonstrates amply that he is just as capable when it comes to staging them. He also displays an uncanny knack for milking suspense out of scenes- in particular, Harry, Hermoine and Ron's daring raid on the Ministry of Magic and their subsequent visit to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and home to Bathilda Bagshot, a magician and dear friend to Dumbledore. These brim with nail-biting tension, and Yates plays them out nicely to set your pulse racing at the end. \n\nThe crux of this film however lies in the relationships between Harry, Hermoine and Ron as they set off in the middle of the film across the bleak English countryside on their quest to discover the means to destroy the Horcruxes. On the run from Voldemort, the trio find the immensity of their journey taking a toll on them. Harry and Ron's friendship begins to fray as Ron grows suspect of Hermoine's affections for Harry. Meanwhile, Harry can barely conceal his frustration with getting no headway and starts losing his temper at Ron. \n\nInfused with a profound sense of isolation and loss, this middle stretch in the film may be tedious for some impatient viewers, but fans will be rewarded with probably the richest depiction of the relationships between the characters since the first two movies. One scene where Harry and Hermoine suddenly decide to dance together to the tune of Nick Cave's The Children playing on the radio is lyrical in its depiction of their desperate attempt to find levity in a world that affords none. Yes, their friendship strong and deep since the beginning will be tested, and Yates delivers an emotional payoff towards the end of the film that is truly poignant. \n\nThanks to the decision to split the final book into two films, Yates doesn't hurry through these scenes. Instead, he allows the audience to experience the frustration, jealousy and uncertainty of his characters, and allows for Radcliffe, Watson and Grint to display some fine acting with the minimalest distraction from any visual effects. The additional time also turns out to be a blessing for fans and audiences, allowing them the opportunity to see their favourite supporting characters back on screen- most prominently of course Dobby the elf who returns to give the movie a touching finale. \n\nAmidst the gloom, screenwriter Steve Kloves again provides for rare welcome moments of levity. Harry's escort mission is aided by magical decoys of Harry, one of them wearing a bra. To get to the Ministry of Magic, one needs to flush oneself down a toilet bowl. These occasional sparks of humour enliven a film that is otherwise ominous and menacing. Kloves however fumbles slightly with the lengthy expository, and those who have not read the book will find themselves struggling to catch up with the significance of certain characters (e.g. Sirius' brother, Regulus Arcturus Black) and certain events (e.g. Bathilda turning into a slithering serpent). \n\nStill Kloves never had an enviable task to begin with, and Yates- at his most confident here- guides the proceedings along admirably, unfolding them briskly at the start, then settling in for a deliberately measured pace and finally picking up speed for as much as a climax as this first- parter can have. His assuredness also shows in his artistic choices, especially a wayang-kulit-like animated sequence telling the story of the Deathly Hallows. \n\nThough we know better than to expect the grand showdown between Harry and Voldemort by the end of the film, there is still a distinct sense that what we have seen so far is only a build-up for something bigger and far more astounding. But even as a prelude, this seventh film is notable in its own right, a tense and thrilling experience darker, scarier and more mature than any of its predecessors.\"Deathly Hallows Part 1\" follows the book closely, but misses out on a few interesting scenes, and then makes up a few additional scenes that are poignant and incredibly welcome. \n\nIn the beginning, it seems like the film's skipping through the book's content very quickly, but it makes sense, when you realise how much is going on. At the end, the beginning is far away, although the journey there doesn't make it seem like a long while. \n\nGeneral opinion seems to be that it drags in the middle, but, let's face it, so did the book. There's no real reason to complain about Endless Camping Trips at all, because the film moves from plot point to set piece to plot point all the time. There's some clever ways the film handles its exposition, although it is not without its faults. \n\nThe trio's acting is the second best thing in this film. Emma has improved loads over the past few years, and she seems to be at the top of her game in this film. Her acting is stellar. As usual, Grint gets saddled with the role of comic relief, but he also gets his chance to shine in an array of emotional scenes. Daniel manages to carry the story as the main character. The three manage to stand their own very well without the presence of the adult actors.\n\nSpeaking of adult actors, Nick Morran's Scabior is a delightful character - he's slightly perverted and he has a bit of a Jack Sparrow vibe going on. Peter Mullan's Yaxley was impressive and managed to be quite threatening. It is a shame that we see so little of Bill Nighy's character, the new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour. The character was regrettably cut from the previous film, and I wish they hadn't, if only to see more of Nighy's impressive performance. Old-time familiar faces are great, as usual. Fiona Shaw gets but one shot of screen time, but the look in her eyes says so much about her character. Jasoon Isaacs is terrific as a broken and devastated Lucius Malfoy. The lack of Rickman is a shame, but the presence of Bonham Carter makes up for it. Big baddie Ralph Fiennes manages to finally be a menacing, scary Voldemort in the film's first scenes, but as the story progresses and he gets appearances in a few messy, rushed and disappointing visions, Voldemort's actions just don't continue being an ominous cloud of danger, as they should be. \n\nThe film's greatest achievement, however, is the animated sequence detailing the \"Tale of the Three Brothers\", an interesting wizard fairytale. It is a daring move from the filmmakers, one that will pleasantly surprise the audience.\n\nThe biggest letdown is how the film doesn't just keep going. After two-and-a-half hours, it doesn't feel like the story's finished. A few scenes were added to make the climax more exciting, but it's just a downright shame that the movie doesn't just continue for another hour or two.",

            "content": "A deathly emotional and beautifully shot film that has the potentially to bring you to tears on multiple occasions, even if it might feel like a setup at times rather than its own film. \n\nThe first installment of the two-film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows follows Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) as they search for the pieces of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul that he extracted from his being and hid in obscure locations both far and wide. If the trio is unable to locate and destroy them all, Voldemort will remain immortal. Despite their long friendship, a combination of dark forces, romantic tensions, and long-held secrets threaten to sabotage the mission. \n\nAll great things must come to an end, even if it takes two parts to do so. The seventh film and the first of two parts is not only extremely emotional, but it's the start of what feels like an end to an era. Everything we've been waiting for escalates up to this moment, and you can't help but let your emotions run loose as you see all of our beloved characters. \n\nI guess the only real problem I had with this film is that it feels like a setup sometimes to the grand finale. Some moments and ideas are stretched out a little too long in order to meet a longer run-time but more often than not, it feels kind of useless in a sense. Either way, I still think this film is really well done and although this is a problem, it's not enough to dismay what I felt when watching this movie. \n\nSo far, this has been one of the more emotional films, with much more destruction and crying to come. We see all the characters we know and love come together one last time as they all fight for their lives. We see the sacrifices they all make, the choices they live by, and what they all stand for. It's extremely emotional when you put yourself in this situation, especially when they give you a beginning as they did here. I was on the brink of tears as I saw all the darkness this movie had to offer, which is a magnificent example as to how well these films have done in immersing you in this world.  \n\nI think we really see our main actors shine here. They've all had their moments of glory in the previous films, but I feel like they all give pretty powerful performances here. Everyone from Daniel Radcliffe and down the list, they all offer something great here. Maybe it's the fact of how long everyone's been a part of these films, but they all embrace their characters very well.\n\nSo far out of the first seven films, I think this is the best looking film by far. It's beautifully shot and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. I love the look of this film and everything from the set pieces to where they actually shot the movie is stunning. It's easily the best looking film so far, discounting whatever we'll see from the next film. I really appreciate just how different this film feels based on the settings alone, making it a special one in its own right. \n\nIn the end, this film is extremely dark and magical, signaling the end of a franchise (or, a near end in this case). It's an excellent build up, with some problems for sure, but I can't help how much emotion I feel seeing everything fall together.",

But with a tale as epic as Harry Potter you can understand why they did it. It's true that this film often feels like it's spinning its wheels, with long stretches of downtime, the characters sitting around planning their next move or arguing. What saves it from complete mundanity is its character moments. Each of the 3 principal cast members get a chance to demonstrate their acting chops and reveal the depths of their performances. Some of their conflicts may feel predictable and easy to resolve, but enough of them feel human that the ones which don't aren't too much of an annoyance. It serves its purpose in getting us to the final movie, and is probably the least rewatchable of the series, but for a single viewing it's still a decent flick.",

            "content": "There have been quite a few times, especially recently, when dividing the last story of a franchise into two parts was a huge mistake.  But then there is the Harry Potter series, which managed to make a well-strung first part, which ranks among the franchise's best, to set up one of the greatest conclusions in film history.\n\nUpon first viewing, I wasn't a huge fan of the first Deathly Hallows.  To me, it was missing its own identity and conclusion to feel like its own film.  Of course, this was before having seen part 2.  Now that I have gone back and re-watched each film, I have grown more of an appreciation for the series as a whole, and particularly, Deathly Hallows Part 1.  There are certainly still some minute problems that can be annoying, like Voldemort's minimal presence, but this was the first movie that solely focused on the trio of Harry, Hermione, and Ron.  That was a welcomed shift for me.\n\nAfter the last 3 films, it seemed like the series had already grown up enough.  But I like the fact that this film wasn't just them cutting ties with their family and loved ones to find horcruxes, it was about them becoming adults capable of doing things on their own.  So in many ways, this is a film about unity and independence at the same time.  I love watching the trio have to go on the road and figure out all of the horcruxes without the help of their parents or Dumbledore.  It makes the payoff in the 8th movie all the more gratifying.\n\nThis may be a stretch, but this film feels a lot like a Western set in the Potterverse.  In fact, there are a lot of the same characteristics as a revenge or fantasy-western.  On the run, looking for something significant, and constantly fighting off the looming presence of a bigger evil.  To me, that's a fantasy western.  \n\nNo matter, the film has its fair share of thrilling sequences of action along with some needed heartfelt moments between the trio.  The relationship particularly between Harry and Hermione has never been a focus, in fact rarely touched upon, until this film.  Even though there's nothing romantic at all, it became one of the series' most endearing bonds.  Of course, Ron didn't seem to think so, as he got jealous in the most clich\u00e9d way possible.  But again, Harry and Ron needed that conflict to make the payoff of Ron coming back to save Harry and destroying a Horcrux all the more satisfying.\n\nPlenty of other noteworthy sequences include a brilliantly thoughtful Tale of the 3 Brothers story told by Hermione, Dobby's return, Umbridge's unsettling return, and even the opening escape sequence.  I know it isn't beloved by the fandom like the others, but I believe Deathly Hallows is a necessary deviation from the typical trip to the Potterverse so that part 2 is as epic as we know it is.  Love this film.\n\n+The trio. The whole time\n\n+Returns of beloved characters\n\n+Maturation process for the trio\n\n+Search for the Horcruxes\n\n+So many reveals and set ups\n\n9.3/10",

There is so much build-up to the final conclusion still to come that the ending of Part 1 almost feels like a \"let-down.\" However, what this film does get right is the despair, loneliness, and sheer frustration that Harry, Ron, and Hermione go through as they attempt to hunt down and destroy the evil Lord Voldemort's horcruxes.

For the past several installments, I've been on the fence about Helena Bonham Carter being cast in the role, but her take on Lestrange actually has me distracted from the flow of the story. I want her character gone as soon as possible, and it's not just because of the emotionally wrenching act she committed at the conclusion of this film. (Really though. That was a heartbreaking ending.)\n\nThis installment felt like little more than a stepping stone for the final film, but you have to know that going in.

This feature does manage to stand on its own however my problem with the movie is my problem with all Part 1's of a two part story: It isn't complete. I understand that is kind of the point of splitting a movie into two, however if a 2 hour and 26 minute film cannot be watched and be fully understood without watching its continuation, it can never be close to being a perfect film on its own.

As we draw ever closer to the boy wizards final curtain call, Harry faces old enemies, new obstacles and personal revelations in his quest to put an end to the greatest war in wizarding history.\n\nLeft largely to their own devices both in physical location and acting abilities, the unforgivingly grim beginning-of-the-end odyssey has a vastly contrasting style from its predecessors. \n\nEvading capture, fugitives Harry, Ron and Hermione (Daniel Ratcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson) embark on a secret and perilous mission based on inscrutable clues left by their deceased headmaster Dumbledore's; to find and destroy the Dark Lord Voldemort's well disguised and highly protected secret keys to eternal life, the seven Horcruxes. \nWith no idea what they are, how to find them or how to dismantle them once obtained, Harry and comrades are at odds with the situation and each other.\n\nAdding to the tension, Lord Voldemort's most avid followers, the Death Eaters have seized complete control of the Ministry of Magic, and the wizarding world at large. Terrorising and imprisoning muggle borns, mudbloods and Potter sympathisers, the Death Eaters place a bounty on Harry's head; Undesirable #1, wanted alive. \n\nAs the task becomes overwhelming, all hope the trio hold for victory slowly begins to diminish and hopelessness seeps in. But as the search continues, they uncover a saviour in a long discredited children's tale that may offer a chance, the Deathly Hallows.\n\nEven Harry's direct link to Voldermort's most intimate desires defies understanding and logic. Can they find the horcruxes? Can they stay undetected? Can they uncover Lord Voldemort's plan? Can they figure out what the deathly hallows story means and if it is relevant? And most importantly, Can they stay alive?\n\nOriginally marketed as being presented in 3D, producers have now pulled the idea as it will not do \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows story justice\". As the nine year, seven picture marathon nudges ever closer to 20 hours, splitting the very long seventh instalment into two and partially simplifying the entanglements of the story, viewers happily get the best account of the longest book.\n\nAs is the movie too want, streamlining of the high and low points is the only way to do it justice. The abundance of visual magic, maturing of characters, development of story sophistication and the wonderfully high calibre acting culminate in its ominous and expectant tone building to a completely encompassing ambiance. \n\nSome scenes clearly stand out as beautifully adapted from the book and artful additions to the movie. Harry trying to lighten the tension offering his hand to dance with Hermione, the shadow puppet rendition of the Tale of the Three Brothers story, the candid replicating Harry sevenfold, the house elf scuffle, and Hermione's 'confudousing' of her muggle parents.\n\nOn the other side, the lack of specific location and central focus (previously filled by the safe back drop of Hogwarts school, but now resting on one characters shoulder, although well done on her acting part) leaves viewers a little ungrounded. \n\nThe constant introduction of new unexplored characters and old minimally screened characters is hard to piece who or why they are there, and the frantic blur of movement they add distracts from the spliced story arc. \n\nWith some slightly ambiguous and almost inappropriate directorial missteps; including a disconcertingly over affectionate montage and the ruff removal of some basic plot points, it is clear things could have been handled gentler and simpler. \n\nThe Verdict: A most poignant quote \"I want to bury him. Properly. Without magic.\" Harry potter and his supernatural story begins to draw to a end with style and chivalry. \n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 19/11/2010",

A group of rebellion takes the chance to help Potter through all of this. In order to defeat Voldemort. They need to destroy the 5 Horcruxes that can trigger Voldemort's weaknesses. And this film is what is all about. I thought, maybe it disappoints anyone as storytelling goes. But the quality of the film is still top notch. The pacing jumps from high to low. I love the part where Potter and Hagrid, riding this old school WWII type bicycle, as they where chased by Dementors while exchanging wand powers. I understand, there are some parts that were really unnecessary where like, this film is getting dramatic in an awkward way. I see Potter and Hermoine dancing together while Ron is away or somewhat his jealous about it. Yet it is pretty understandable, more like the impact of the Horcrux is showing. The second half gets me more interested. As It also introduced the story behind the Deathly Hollows. The Invisibility cloak, the Elder wand and the Resurrection stone. And I did like how it was presented in a way of animation. Everything in this film is still engaging as ever. The beautiful landscapes are fantastic, it is visually stunning at some point. Besides of a weaker plot, David Yates and his dark themed fantasy is still as breathtaking as ever. Visually impressive, well acted performances and it is dark as hell.

Overall, however, the film drags on as the story throws seemingly random plot devices at the viewer, threatening to confuse and befuddle rather than intrigue.

Lord Voldemort has been ruling, together with his minions and the 12 Death Eaters. And he wants to eliminate Potter himself. Despite of the  Dumbledor incident. A group of rebellion takes the chance to help Potter through all of this. In order to defeat Voldemort. They need to destroy the 5 Horcruxes that can trigger Voldemort's weaknesses. And this film is what  is all about. I thought, maybe it disappoints anyone as storytelling goes. But the quality of the film is still top notch. The pacing jumps from high to low. I love the part where Potter and Hagrid, riding this old school WWII type bicycle, as they where chased by Dementors while exchanging wand powers.  I understand, there are some parts that were really unnecessary where like, this film is getting dramatic in an awkward way. I see Potter and Hermoine dancing together  while Ron is away or somewhat his jealous about it. Yet it is pretty understandable, more like the impact of the Horcrux is showing. The second half gets me more interested. As It also introduced the story behind the Deathly Hollows. The Invisibility cloak, the  Elder wand and the Resurrection stone. And I did like how it was presented in a way of animation.  Everything in this film is still engaging as ever. The beautiful landscapes are fantastic, it is visually stunning at some point. Besides of a weaker plot, David Yates and his dark themed fantasy is still as breathtaking as ever. Visually impressive, well acted performances and it is dark as hell. I thought this is the darkest and the creepiest Harry Potter yet. Overall a great watch. 4/5",

When Twilight done it, it doesn't make sense, and when The Hunger Games done it, it makes even less sense, and I'm a fan of the Hunger Games. So with this, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 may feel like the prelude to Part 2, but it still holds out on its own. The camerawork is really good, and the soundtrack by Alexander Desplat is good also. The movie mostly rest on the the three main leads, and they are great as usual. The movie is definitely the most serious out of all the Harry Potter films which was argued that it took some of the magic away. Also the middle was really slow which some people would get bored at, but I wasn't bored at all. It still has some funny moments, but not as many though which was a bit disappointing. The effects gets more and more impressive from every Harry Potter film to the next, and there's some really good chase scenes that got me excited. There was some convenient moments that just came out of nowhere, and the Snatchers were underused and I didn't really know much about them. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 isn't going to be anyone's favorite Harry Potter movie and quite frankly, I think it's the least best, but it's still a nice addition to the series.",

            "content": "It's very easy to hold a grudge against Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows purely on the grounds of the industrial precedent it created. The financial success of splitting the last and biggest of the books into two instalments led to the same tactic being employed with Twilight and The Hunger Games, regardless of whether their respective source materials actually merited such an approach. For fans and casual viewers alike, the move smacked of wanting to milk as much as possible out of the last drops of a given franchise.\n\nIn the case of HP7a (as Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo christened it), we find the franchise finally starting to cut to the chase, beginning the build-up towards the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. Having drawn things out for so long, putting off this inevitable showdown, there is almost a rush to get in everything that is left to be said. Under these circumstances, splitting the book into two films is almost the most logical thing to do, and while not all of it works, it does have a lot of attractive qualities.\n\nThe feeling that a lot is being crammed into this final act brings us back to our ongoing comparison with The Lord of the Rings. Many film fans had quibbles with the ending(s) of The Return of the King, and fans of the book were in two minds about some of the omissions, particularly the scourging of the Shire and the death of Saruman (in the theatrical cut). But even taking those as gospel truth - for the moment - Peter Jackson did quite an excellent job of balancing and converging all the different aspects of Middle Earth in the climatic battles - a much better job, in fact, than he managed recently on the third and final Hobbit film.\n\nBy contrast, Deathly Hallows - Part 1 has a lot of plot for us to swallow, making it simultanously one of the most satisfying and one of the most impenetrable instalments in the series. If you spent the previous two films crying out for a plot which directly focussed on the  return of Voldemort and what his victory could mean for the wider world, you will find yourself openly rejoicing at the fact that this is finally being addressed. Equally, the series is so far gone and insular by this point, that if you happen to find yourself watching this by accident on late-night TV, chances are that you won't have the faintest idea what is going on.\n\nThe film is helped somewhat in this regard by the horcruxes, a plot device which I covered in detail in my previous Harry Potter review. All of my criticisms of this McGuffin aside, the hunt for the horcruxes gives the film structure and a definite end-point towards which we are heading. Like The Two Towers, Deathly Hallows - Part 1 ends before said end-point has been reached, but like Jackson's film there is (to some extent) a feeling of catharsis and expectation of what is to come. That being said, the death of Dobby, like Dumbledore's in the previous film, still feels like an arbitrary event, included purely because it happened in the book. For all his dramatic credentials, David Yates still hasn't grasped how to build up tension so that a death can carry meaning: it's not so much a 'shock death' as a nothing-death.\n\nBy focussing on the search for the horcruxes, and taking the action away from Hogwarts, Deathly Hallows - Part 1 moves the series into more candidly existential territory. Our three main characters are at their most isolated and strained since Goblet of Fire, faced with a quest which is seemingly impossible, and having to cope without either the wisdom or protection of their teachers. Kermode's comparisons with Ingmar Bergman may seem far-fetched at first glance, but there is a point behind them: there are fewer creature comforts here than in previous efforts, and like Bergman's films there is little credence given to sentimentality.\n\nThe aesthetic of Deathly Hallows - Part 1 reflects this desire for all the stability and comfort in Harry's world to be diminished. Eduardo Serra, who won a BAFTA for his work on Wings of a Dove, shoots the action in a more pathos-ridden manner, emphasising the stillness of the woods, the intimidating dark colours and the increasingly pallid landscapes. Yates employs more hand-held work for the chase sequences through the woods, but is also judicious in his choice of wide shots to reinforce the smallness of the characters. There are times in Alexandre Desplat's soundtrack when the world around the characters seems to creak and wail, akin to Alan Splet's extraordinary work on David Lynch's Eraserhead.\n\nTwo sequences in the film reinforce the feeling of gathering gloom and descending darkness better than any other. The first is the animated rendering of the Tale of the Three Brothers, whose stick-like characterisations are somewhere between Classical depictions of soldiers and the caricatures of Gerald Scarfe. The animation on its own is beautifully designed and well-told, but the sequence gives the eponymous hallows more status than they would have had if introduced through just another swathe of exposition. The tale has a Chaucerian quality to it, with Death's characterisation being as subtle and cunning as his namesake in 'The Pardoner's Tale' within The Canterbury Tales.\n\nThe second, equally potent sequence is the trio's infiltration of the Ministry of Magic. I mentioned in my review of Order of the Phoenix about the Ministry's design being rooted in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. What was then a mere inflection is now made flesh, with Yates borrowing heavily yet grippingly from the Michael Radford adaptation, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton. The low-angle shots of the banners and wanted posters, not to mention the robotic movements of the Ministry's employees, reinforce the feeling of freedom and justice being crushed in the name of purity and homogeny. Imelda Staunton's return as Dolores Umbridge only hammers this home, taking her inevitable place as the puppet of a state governed by fear, and projecting her own self-loathing onto those she deems inferior.\n\nIn the end, however, the centrepiece of Deathly Hallows - Part 1 is the relationship between our central trio, something which is anchored us throughout the ups and downs of the entire series. Like Goblet of Fire, seeing the central three at each others' throats is completely believable, but now that the stakes are raised their every tiff or raised voice could spell disaster. Rupert Grint does especially well in conveying the frustration of his character, whether it's listening to the radio to see whether his family has been killed, or his reaction to the nightmarish visions which burst forth from the locket.\n\nThe only problem with the approach that Yates adopts is that the character-driven scenes begin to feel repetitive very quickly. It's not quite the case that you could show these sequences in any order you please, but the fact that Ron comes back so relatively quickly negates a lot of the emotional impact of his departure. Equally, there's little to suggest that the order in which the horcruxes are destroyed is the only order in which they could have been tackled; in this film at least, there's no progression from one to the other in terms of their potency or difficulty.\n\nAnother big problem with which the film is lumbered is the need to tie up a lot of the supporting storylines, often by simply killing people off. Rowling described the action of the final book as a war, and in war unpredictable deaths are to be expected. But that doesn't mean that characters and creatures to which we have dedicated several years of our lives can just be swept aside as collatoral damage. If you thought that Ginny and Harry's kiss in Half-Blood Prince came out of nowhere, a lot of Deathly Hallows - Part 1 will feel completely jarring and inert. Once again, Yates can't deliver the knock-out blow when it matters most, working so hard on a general tone that the particular moments carry no weight.\n\nIt's not just the death of Dobby which falls into this category; the entire Battle of the Seven Potters is a classic example of this approach. The special effects needed to create seven Daniel Radcliffes are all well and good, but the battle's choreography is choppy and disorientating; it doesn't communicate the chaos of the battle, it just leaves you wondering why they bothered in the first place. The deaths of multiple characters are treated in a lackadaisical, matter-of-fact manner, whether we see them on screen (Hedwig) or are simply told about them (Mad-Eye Moody). To top it off, Voldemort's appearance in the scene is a complete waste of time: he doesn't come across as threatening, he does nothing of significance, and he's so easily defeated.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 1 is an intriguing, atmospheric and bleak offering which serves up a lot of good points in amongst its all-too-common drawbacks. It is perhaps the strongest of the Harry Potter films since Goblet of Fire, and unlike many of the films in the series it may well improve with repeat viewings. But while its visuals and main characters are impressive, it's ultimately hobbled or reined in by meaningless deaths and dull repetition. For fans, it's an impressive and ambitious sequel; for cynics, it's a reassurance that, very soon, this will all be over.",

The part 1 and part 2 of 'Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows' could've been one movie for sure! That being said of course the studio wants to take a quick way out and be in the money for these two unnecessary parts to this epic conclusion of the serious! Now the acting is top notch and I love to see how these actors in the series grew better and better by each film. The directing is great by steady camera shots of CGI or practical effects. Sceneries are magnificent when it comes to this film. The darkness and eeriness to the mood builds up enjoyment and unexpected realism. Yeah the drama is a little too soap opera to me and forced. The elements to magic and wizardry is underused. We as the audience are getting nothing but worthless dialogue of mediocre drama. I know the script writer wants to build more character into these characters but c'mon we get the point already! There is barely any action in it which is not a horrible thing. But in my mind this bothers me that this movie has potential to get me on the edge of my seat for part 2 and it didn't in reality. In my opinion this is a cash grab but disguised as a decent film overall. Moving on, this is a underachieved a Harry Potter film. I will probably not watch this film again. I mean I enjoyed it, it's just that it is a huge let down. The beginning of this movie. The first 45 minutes right.. perfect! I loved the beginning of the film with Harry growing up and wing in danger. Fighting back against the de mentors. I love that aspect of it. Now ok when it's making it's way to the middle and end I was like meh... Boring but has it's shinning moments here and there and is an appreciated movie itself. And also by the way not shunned by the Harry Potter fans. So Props! Overall, I will give 'Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 1' a C+.",

It enhanced some parts of the books while I expected more on the fight scenes. Bonnie Wright is a terrible actress, I can't stand her. How can someone ruin so much of a film in just 5 minutes? Watson still performed her role well, so did Radcliffe. It certainly would be a good film for the die hard fans, but as a critic, it could have been better.",
