            "content": "The Social Network\" (2010) is a drama/history movie that tells the story of the creation of Facebook and the early days of the company. Directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin, the film explores the relationships, rivalries, and legal battles that shaped one of the most successful and influential companies of our time.\n\nJesse Eisenberg gives a standout performance as Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and CEO of Facebook, capturing his mix of ambition, insecurity, and single-minded focus. The rest of the cast, including Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, and Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins, are all excellent in their roles.\n\nThe film's screenplay by Aaron Sorkin is sharp, witty, and insightful, exploring the motivations and personal dynamics that drove the creation of Facebook. The film's direction by David Fincher is confident and assured, delivering a visual style that is both stylish and effective.\n\nThe film's music, composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, is noteworthy, with a haunting and ominous score that adds to the film's tension and atmosphere. The film's cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is impressive, capturing the look and feel of the early 2000s with style and precision.\n\nHowever, some may argue that the film takes liberties with the true story of Facebook's creation, presenting a biased and distorted view of events. Additionally, some may find the film's fast-paced and dialogue-driven style to be unrelatable or off-putting.\n\nOverall, \"The Social Network\" is a well-made and thought-provoking drama/history movie that explores the creation of Facebook and its impact on society. With strong performances, sharp writing, and confident direction, \"The Social Network\" is a movie that will be remembered and discussed for years to come.",

Directed by David Fincher, it is an uncompromising examination of some of humanities worst traits \u2013 avarice, jealousy, condescension, and megalomania, among others.  Despite this, it is riveting throughout.  Thanks to Aaron Sorkin's remarkable script, there is never a wasted scene.  The film is also buoyed by a fantastic score from Trent Reznor and solid performances from the entire cast.  The Social Network is, arguably, one of the best American films of the 21st century\u2026if not the best.",

Or maybe I'm reading too much into what is basically an addictive time-killer of a website where I can chat with friends and find out what they're doing and thinking. Yet you can be sure questions about yourself and our modern social mindset will be raised watching this superb film, one of 2010's best. It's not just the story of how Facebook came to fruition, although that fascinating tale is told with fluid virtuoso. It's also a chilling reflection of our self-absorbed times, where we feel the need to link up with \"friends\" and spill our guts out to them and anyone else who can access this social network, posting thoughts or details that we think the world may actually care about, a notion reinforced by one of the film's most disturbing lines of dialogue: \"Private behavior is a relic of a time gone by.\" So it is. It's also a film about codes of communication, between ourselves and others, in either analog or digital ways. The genius in David Fincher's direction is how he turns typically dry material--court depositions, computer hacking and programming--into riveting, thought-provoking entertainment. And the brilliance of Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is in giving his characters great, sassy dialogue to spit out at each other, which the actors fire off in their back-and-forths (something set up in the terrific opening scene). The film is shot and edited into a pace that compliments the rapid-fire dialogue as the two-hour film just flies by. Jesse Eisenberg stunningly portrays Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as a callous, narrow-minded jerk, a tragic hero whose inability to modulate his social skills and status force him to find other means of doing so, hence the website. Fincher surrounds him with a terrific supporting cast--Andrew Garfield (the new Spider-Man), Rooney Mara (the new American 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'), and best of all Justin Timberlake, who plays Napster founder Sean Parker as a slick, shallow playboy who's smart enough to figure out what Facebook can be and how to work himself into Zuckerberg's orbit to take part of this revolution. He's the ultimate narcissist, and Timberlake just kills, oozing a devilish charm and relishing Parker's slippery manipulation. It's a tasty role that could earn him a Best Supporting Actor nomination. The validity of this story is somewhat debatable (there is fiction involved here), but this is undeniably a compelling, psychologically fascinating spin on recent history that will leave more than a few questions lurking in your head afterwards, questions you might end up sharing on your FB status",

            "content": "Though I don't think this movie is perfect, it is as close to the line as you can get. As usual, 2 reasons to go and 1 reasons to not.\n\nThe first and most important reason to go watch it (arguably the most important part of a movie) is the writing. In the beautiful style of Sorkin with lines flowing gracefully and effortlessly off the tongue as if the actors were speaking them in real life. I enjoy this movie because of the up-and-down lengths of the dialogue and the unyielding intensity of each one spoken. (I will go into this in the next part)\n\nAnother reason to go see it is the actor's performance. I don't think it was perfect but the imperfection of it is the beauty of it. Personally, my favorite scene is the end when the lawyers talk about the dilution of the shares. You can see the hurt in Garfield's eyes when he says, \"it wasn't\" over and over. You can see how much it fills him with silent rage as he was probably still grieving the loss of the company he created as well as Eisenberg's not necessarily blank but obviously hurt expression as Saverin is saying the stunning percentage he was left with. The beauty of Sorkin's writing is that it adds to the drama by giving the actors mini-soliloquies to work into their performance. The long lines don't feel long and the short lines seem short as it should be.\n\nOne reason not to see it is the sheer boringness of the cinematography. I don't particularly like how it feels like a drama with boring shots and vanilla camera movements but I do think it is ok at least. It shouldn't be like a Luhrmann film because it simply doesn't need that but I would say to just spice it up a little bit at least.\n\nAmazing movie, definitely watch it.",

Even Justin Timberlake does a pretty great job in his role, although it's nothing special. Facebook has a surprisingly interesting origin, and I'm glad that we got a film to satisfy that niche as I'm glad it got told in such an interesting way rather than a bland documentary. David Fincher also always uses a distinct cinematography style that incorporates gritty with surprisingly beautiful shots that encompass the loneliness and isolation felt of being a CEO, and the hard choices that come along the way.

The Social Network introduces the story behind Facebook which is almost irrelevant to people just signing up for an account. When entrepreneurs come out with new creations it doesn't occur that there are likely huge stories behind it rather than a simple idea that came about. The story behind Facebook is especially interesting and Mark's journey with it as well. Most everyone has a Facebook profile as well as knows who Mark Zuckerburg is, so it makes it very easy to feel connected and interested in Zuckerburg's creation of Facebook. \n\nThe Social Network focuses on the role social media plays in our everyday lives. It is obvious that social media has affected people in many ways, good and bad. This movie shows how it had a negative effect before the main base of social media even fully began. Today, social media is just a part of everyone's life whether you intend for it to be or not. This movie shows how Facebook and other new social media platforms keep becoming easier for people to abuse. It is apparent that even in the beginning of social media there was a problem with people using it to exploit, condescend, and compare others.",

With an intriguing concept, it is for me one of the defining films I have seen recently, one of the best movies of 2010 and relevant in its themes of greed, betrayal, class tension, friendship and loyalty and concept.\n\nProduction-values-wise, The Social Network looks wonderful. The cinematography is incredibly skillful, and the editing is crisp. In fact, I'd sure The Social Network is director David Fincher's most stylish film since Se7en. I have heard a lot of mixed feelings on the score, while it is not my favourite of the year not like Toy Story 3, King's Speech and Inception, The Social Network's brooding, smooth and quite sexy score is very memorable and fits well with the film's occasionally quirky tone.\n\nThe Social Network is very well directed too. Fincher directs with an intensity and focus that makes The Social Network tied with Se7en as the best of his movies in my opinion. Another strong point is the screenplay which is very smart and sharp, while the story making the most of this intriguing concept is constantly snappy and engaging.\n\nAlso, all the characters are very well written and assembled, for me they are among the best-written characters in a Fincher movie. It also helps that the acting is as impeccable as it is. Jesse Eisenberg is very commanding as the titular character in a subtle sort of way, while Andrew Garfield also impresses as the \"voice of reason\" character. I was surprised in a good way by Justin Timberlake, while the weakest of the three leads, he does have a cocksure swagger here that he actually pulls off really well.\n\nIn conclusion, a wonderful film and one of the best of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

With that being said-Aaron Sorkin's a master screenwriter and the depth and quality of his dialogue is captured beautifully in the hands of someone else directing, and having that someone be David Fincher, no less. I will say, though, I just never felt sympathy for Mark Zuckerberg and I had all the sympathy in the world for Eduardo Saverin as presented in the film. Andrew Garfield gave an incredible performance, and I think the reason the movie works so well is that while I didn't feel sympathy for Jesse Eisenberg's Zuckerberg (and loved to hate Justin Timberlake's Sean Parker), the screenplay and directing didn't force the audience with no other choice. The Social Network is a great multidimensional story that will stay with me.\n\n(Ann Perkins!)",

            "content": "The movie follows Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard freshman, on a date with his girlfriend, Erica who dumps him for his disrespectful behavior. Later that night, Mark reacts to his breakup by creating a website called Facesmash. On it, male students rated female students, from different universities, according to their \"hotness\" and attractiveness. This catches the attention of the Winklevoss twins, wealthy students from Harvard, who hire Mark to develop their website called HarvardConnect, a social site where Harvard students could meet more people and become friends online. However, Mark goes with a similar idea of a website to his best friend, Eduardo Saverin, who has money. After months of ignoring the Winklevoss twins, Mark creates TheFacebook (later changed to Facebook) with the economical help of Eduardo, and both become co-founders of the site. TheFacebook becomes a success and brings the attention of Sean Parker, the former founder of Napster. Saverin warns Mark about Sean being a drug addict, yet Mark becomes friends with him and welcomes him to the company. Later, Zuckerberg betrays his best friend by diluting Eduardo's shares from 34% (24 million approx.) to 0.03%, and under the influence of Sean, removes his co-founder status. Later that day, Sean gets caught using drugs and partying with minors and Mark fires him from Facebook. The film ends with the founder alone, without any friends, and having 2 lawsuits from the Winklevoss twins, and his former best friend, Eduardo. \n\nThe Social Network explores 3 main themes: friendship, jealousy, and success. Success is something that every person looks forward to and in Harvard success comes from being on a social club. The Phoenix Club, as we learn from the film, is one of the oldest clubs in Harvard whose members become presidents, C.E. O's or influential people worldwide. This club is what begins to build up the themes. From the beginning, we learn about the club and what it means to be a member. Eduardo and Mark's wish is to be elected. However, only Eduardo gets the chance.  When Saverin tells Mark about the club, we get a hint that Mark is jealous. Also, at the same time, after the Facemash's backlash, Mark has an obligation to clean his image and do something that would make people like him. Facebook becomes the solution. Nonetheless, as he makes the app with Eduardo, Facebook would not be fully his. So, under Sean Parker's dislike of Eduardo, he betrays his best friend. In this part, jealousy destroys and takes everything from Mark. He is now alone, without any friends or girlfriend, because of his own decisions to chase success. \nAnother theme that works as a sub-topic is Mark's awkward personality. In the movie, although Mark makes everything wrong, you don't end up hating him. You get sympathy for him. No one is the villain, but rather the victim. In the ending scene, Mark is alone with a computer, trying to get Erica to respond to his Facebook request. After his success, without getting into the Phoenix, he doesn't have anyone by his side. He is on Facebook waiting for Erica and keeps refreshing the site over and over again. Here, we realize the impact of his breakup and his personality. He acted arrogant and disrespectful because he doesn't know how to act with people. Even Facebook, which he created for people to connect with other people, leaves him feeling more disconnected and emptier from Erica, his friends, and from everyone else. \n\nThis movie is breathtaking. Since the opening scene, you are entertained and fully attach to the character of Mark. Similarly, the movie feels like a rollercoaster. The storytelling is engaging to the way the story is being told from the beginning. This makes the audience make assumptions and be surprised with secrets that are being revealed. The acting is phenomenal. As this movie takes diverse themes, every character has an evolution. For instance, Andrew Garfield in the betrayal scene is amazing. The soundtrack is fulfilled. The minimalism it transmits and the computer vibes it gives fit perfectly with all the themes it portrays. This movie is 5 stars for sure.",

Other litigants depicted in the movie are also, in real life, sworn to silence. So it's impossible to know how some of these events went down. I guess that gives Sorkin some leeway to imagine.

I found virtually everything in the film perfect from the performances, the rich sound design and the impeccable script from Aaron Sorkin.\n\nDavid Fincher did a tremendous job with his direction here. He nailed every scene and made it very coherent throughout. The narrative is simple to follow, but Fincher made it dramatic and thrilling just when It needed to be. \n\nAs stated just, the performances from all major cast members are spot on. However, Andrew Garfield's as Eduardo Saverin (Zuckerburg's business parter) is my standout favourite. Garfield is such an underrated actor and brought a level of intensity that elevated the film to it's peak. Eissenberg was comparatively brilliant as Mark Zuckerburg himself, adding that evil genius charm and effortless precision that made him so perfect for that role. \n\nThe performances were made extra special by the outstanding writing of screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin's words just compelled me throughout in every scene. He makes normal conversations even more engaging and his fast-paced style just blew my mind. \n\nTechnically also, this film hits the heights. The sound design from Ren Kylce, as well as the music from score veterans Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross make the film not only visually enthralling but also tremendously captivating from an audible standpoint.\n\n\"It is No 1 because it's the best, that's all! It crushes all the competition,\". This is what Quentin Tarantino said on 'The Social Network' being one of the best films of the 2010's.

The lead, Mark Zuckerberg (Jessie Eisenberg), is a brilliant yet idiotic, pretentious dick who I might suggest doesn't have a heart. Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) could rival Heath Ledger's Joker for best villain in cinematic history and literally everybody else in this movie is extremely unlikable and distasteful (except for Rooney Mara's character). They, the writers, absolutely meant it to be that way, but it doesn't mean have to like it. Also, the 3rd act moves way too fast and seems as the though the writers and Fincher wanted to finish the movie as quick as possible. Which really sucks. But after saying all that, I have to admit, this is a pretty good film. I like the pacing (until the 3rd act), editing and the cinematography. I also think most, if not all the performances were really good. Jessie Eisenberg played a very convincing A.I. and Justin Timberlake played a great immature asshole. Andrew Garfield was amazing too, like usual. All in all, this was a good but not great movie. I still would recommend it though.",

The direction of Fincher and the script of Sorkin make this film look like a thriller, a dark thriller, when in one of its many layers it is a film about envy and teenage immaturity, one of the greatest qualities of the films of Fincher is that they are very complex, and can cover as many topics as they want.\n\nThe Social Network with Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac joins the list of masterpieces created by the hand of David Fincher, one of the artists more prolific of the seventh art.\n\nAlthough I almost never talk about such repetitive themes as the interpretations in my reviews, since it is obvious when the performances are good and not, and most of the reviews say the same about that, but this time the young actors who keep this movie afloat deserve a line of recognition or more. 9.4/10",

He is portrayed in \"The Social Network\" as a man with an apparent tendency to verbalize whatever thought enters his mind, without so much as a second for consideration. A man who is filterless to a volatile extent - and that's what makes him so fascinating to watch.\n\nThe opening scene of the movie takes place inside of a bar, where Mark (Jesse Eisenberg) sits across from his (fictitious) girlfriend Erika (Rooney Mara). After an argument, Erika breaks up with Mark, subsequently delivering the film's single most memorable line: \"Look, you are probably going to be a very successful computer person, but you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know from the bottom of my heart that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole.\" \n\nFilled with bitterness, Mark returns to his dorm room at Harvard and, having nothing better to do, hacks into the school's computer system from which he acquires pictures of several girls, which he posts online so that other male students can compare them; he is eventually caught. While this does not put him in good standings with the school, it does manage to get him noticed by the Winklevosses, two brothers (both played by Armie Hammer) who have an idea for a dating site for Harvard students. They ask Mark to serve as their programmer, and he accepts the offer. However, he instead begins working on an awfully similar project of his own, which becomes the immensely successful Facebook. Outraged, the Winklevosses take legal action.\n\nIt should be noted that the real mark Zuckerberg did not find the film to be a particularly accurate portrayal of him or of Facebook's origin. He was asked for his thoughts on it during a public Q and A and replied with, \"I think the reality is that writing code and building a product and then building a company actually is not a glamorous enough thing to make a movie about. So you can imagine that a lot of the stuff they probably had to embellish and make-up because if they were really making a movie it would've been of me sitting at a computer coding for two hours straight, which probably would've just not been that good of a movie.\" he also went on to say, \"They just kind of made up a bunch of stuff that I found kind of hurtful.\"\n\nAccuracy aside, \"The Social Network\" still has a lot going for it, featuring strong performances from Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, and, most of all, Jesse Eisenberg. In addition, writer Aaron Sorkin has managed to assemble a brilliant, well-paced script with terrific dialogue, which, when combined with the iconic directorial stylings of David Fincher, delivers predictably masterful results. It was interesting to see Fincher direct something so different from the rest of his body of work (some of his other credits include \"Seven,\" \"The Game,\" and \"Fight Club\").\n\nWhile it may not be the perfectly truthful Facebook origin story, \"The Social Network\" sure kept me hooked and entertained. Who knew a movie about website development could be so fascinating?",

Boasting a nonlinear but tremendously effective structure, the two pillars of any film - story and characters - are wonderfully built, even reaching the point of making the viewer feel invested in a despicable yet fascinating protagonist. Jesse Eisenberg shines in a career-defining performance, but Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake also rise to the necessary level of dedication, dealing with the rapid-fire dialogues and outstanding long takes seamlessly. Technically, great camera work offers a realistic feel, an addictive score increases the excitement levels, and flawless editing makes the different timelines shift seamlessly. Despite an occasionally unnecessary, irrelevant detour concerning a minor subplot, this is another brilliant addition to Fincher's filmography.\"",

Add to that the irreproachable performances of the cast, and especially Eisenberg and Garfield, and the movie is almost beyond reproach. There are so many iconic scenes that it is difficult to portray one as most emblematic of the movie's success, but images of a teary-eyed Andrew Garfield slamming a laptop into pieces, yelling about 'fuck you flip-flops' and threatening Justin Timberlake with simmering fury will haunt me forever.

Also, Jesse Eisenberg is great in almost everything he does, so it was slightly surprising when, although I liked the movie a lot, it wasn't for the reasons I had thought. As a start, the direction of the movie works extremely well. Simply the way it is shot conveys the story incredibly well, David Fincher, who also directed Fight Club, is definitely well fit for a project like this. Also, while I expected to enjoy Jesse Eisenberg's experience, Andrew Garfield was the clear standout. I was shocked when I looked at this movie's awards and found that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar based on his performance. My only previous experience of Andrew Garfield was the first Amazing Spider-Man, which I absolutely hated. It should also be mentioned that the music score fits quite nicely with Fincher's director. Now, as for my critiques, I'd certainly mentioned that the story itself is a little all over the place. While it is easy to follow, I felt that the pacing of certain bits didn't quite fit. The dialogue seemed to fit the age group, but because of that, it did seem that some of it was slightly clunky. Still, I think that the overall design of the way the movie looks and feels is, not only a great documentary, but also a great coming of age story. So, I would most likely recommend it.",

Sean preaches, and Mark convinces himself, that nice people like Eduardo can never succeed in our dog eat dog world. But they get tunnel vision and in that way they aren't as attuned to the world's ways as they thought, desperately clinging to their flawed understanding of society. Therefore, they try to create a new online world and the rest of us back on Earth are now grappling with the consequences of these men's actions. \n\nIn reality, while Eduardo (and \"nice guys\" writ large) may not catch a big fish, he may catch a lot of fish. \n\nFor me, the movie is interesting and moves along nicely to keep your attention even outside of the deeper messages!

            "content": "I just want to get this out there right away and put the cards on the table so to speak: When I first heard about it, I had very little faith in this project. I was stupefied, confused by the thought of what attracted all this talent to this seemingly trivial story to begin with? Why would David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin possibly be interested in the story of the founding of Facebook? Surely they could have found something more important, more meaningful to apply their efforts to. After seeing the film, though, I realized that, of course, Fincher and Sorkin knew what they were doing all along. And furthermore that labeling this as \"The Facebook movie\" is really an insult to what Sorkin and Fincher were trying to and have succeeded in achieving with this film.\n\nFirst and foremost, I have to take a step back and admire this film as a technical achievement. Despite seeming to be a departure for Fincher in terms of content and subject matter \u2013 which it is and then again isn't \u2013 the film is very clearly and undeniably a Fincher film. Re-teaming with his Fight Club director of photography Jeff Cronenweth, Fincher manages to create and capture that really unique look all of his films have. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous \u2013 once again, Fincher proves that he is probably getting the best results in digital photography out of any other director working in that medium, and this film, shot on the RED One camera, looks absolutely beautiful, from the framing to the camera movement to the lighting and on to the look and the feel of the depth of field the RED captures.\n\nSorkin's script is also an impeccable achievement and showcases, once again just what a genius this man really is. From a structural standpoint it employs a very effective use of a framing device \u2013 the Zuckerberg lawsuit depositions, which introduce the various characters and lead into \"flashbacks\" of the events being discussed. It really lends the film a Rashomon air and intensifies the mystery behind the Zuckerberg character and what exactly transpired in the creation of this phenomenon, Facebook. Sorkin also demonstrates an acute awareness of character construction, and manages to create a loathsome protagonist we hate and are frustrated by but yet we still end up sympathizing with. Most of all, though, it's a showcase of Sorkin's impeccable writing style and knack for writing dialogue with a very unique sound and rhythm. I saw Fincher refer to it as \"Sorkinese\" in an interview, and this is a really good description \u2013 it is certainly very unique to Sorkin and the scripts he has written, and it is also certainly a completely unique language \u2013 one which normal people in our real world do not speak, but that just sounds great on screen. The rapid-fire, overlapping dialogue remains one of the highlights of the film for me, and the script is certainly a shoo-in for Oscar consideration.\n\nThe film is also a rare showcase of pure acting prowess, and features a very interesting and eclectic cast of young actors stepping out of their comfort zones and delivering some truly phenomenal work. The casting of the film is quite a departure for Fincher, who has enough clout to gather the biggest names working in the business. Instead, he opted to go for a cast of relative unknowns or up-and-comers, and really make stars out of them. First and foremost to be mentioned is Jesse Eisenberg, an actor I have personally been a fan of since The Squid and the Whale in 2005 and one whose work I have continued to enjoy since then. However, no matter how good he was in those previous films, none of his previous performances compare to his amazing achievement on this film. Stripping away his signature goofiness and neurosis, Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg as a cold, calculated and determined genius who knows what he wants, is very confident and forward-looking and will stop at nothing to get it. His counter in the film is Saverin, played brilliantly by Andrew Garfield, a name we will be hearing a lot more of of in the next few years: Saverin is a far more sympathetic character, more warm and inviting \u2013 these traits only increase the impact of the tragedy of Zuckerberg's betrayal of their friendship.",

The dynamic, dialogue-driven writing chews out our moral compass from the inside, with the words demonising the humans of the story as much as Fincher's sharp direction humanises the demons themselves. This leaves everybody refreshing their databases for the answers to who the real demons are in this toxic tale of triumph and treachery \u2014- because the actors sure do sell it.\nIroh's grade: B+",

However, the portrayal of Eduardo Saverin by Andrew Garfield was one of the most compelling acting shown in recent years, with one particular long take shown in the third act of the movie overshadowing most other acts of the film. David Fincher's decision to merge the law suit with the creation and rise of Facebook starts of slightly confusing with a lack of time stamp but becomes a key element of story telling throughout the second and third act. David Fincher's decision to use long wide shots also added a slower pace to the movie, which suits the themes of the film.

It is based on Ben Mezrich's 2009 book \u2018The Accidental Billionaires'.\nWho would have thought a movie based off the creation of Facebook would be entertaining, let alone of the best movies of 2010. \nOn a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room as a small site among friends soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history, but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications.\nAll the performances in the movie are great. Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg, who has a fast-paced, nerdy, kind of jerk-ish attitude, and Andrew Garfield is his best friend, found me rooting for him through the whole film, even more than Mark. Justin Timberlake does a decent job but is lost among the other performances.\nThe direction comes from David Fincher who has had variable success, all the way from \u2018Alien 3' to \u2018Se7en', but here he is right on form with a flashy, but tightly structured, presentation that never fails to command your attention and interest. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, which is crazy given the context of the film. Only Fincher could make that happen.\nOverall, the movie keeps your attention throughout with great performances and an intriguing story. It shows different sides of one story and how much it took to get Facebook off the ground.\n4.5/5",

He loves his girlfriend. He loves his best friend \"what an astounding piece of acting that was by Andrew Garfield, especially that final scene when he found out he was being taken out from everything.\" but the guy can't just help it.

The Social Network is instead more concerned with telling the complex and muddled story of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, a man who alienates himself in his relentless pursuit for popularity and acceptance. Is The Social Network a Generation Y version of Citizen Kane? Yes. The Social Network is a complete film, impeccably scripted, flawlessly directed, and full of extraordinary performances (Andrew Garfield, in particular).\n\nDirector David Fincher is often labeled a \"perfectionist,\" notorious for shooting scenes fifty or more times until they earn his approval, and Fincher's perfectionism is on full display here - earning The Social Network a perfect five out of five stars.",

            "content": "When we think of a biopic, we usually think of a film that captures a triumphant moment in history when an individual has had a significant influence. Although David Fincher's The Social Network captures a significant moment in history when Mark Zuckerberg created one of the most influential and popular entities of the 21st century, this film is anything but a celebration. For Fincher, it seems the creation of Facebook shouldn't be documented as an account of a brilliant genius but rather a egotistical genius who created the famous social media from the most shallowest motivations.\n\nFrom the opening five minutes, Aaron Sorkin's script does an incredible job at revealing the psyche of Zuckerberg.\u00a0The brilliance of this opening scene is that perfectly captures the fundamentals of this character within the space of five minutes.\u00a0In having a conversation with his girlfriend, Zuckerberg's\u00a0condescending nature,\u00a0egotism and awkward social skills are painfully apparent.\u00a0\u00a0Essentially, he's highly narcissistic and wants to be recognized or considered significant; however, Zuckerberg's crucial flaw is that he\u00a0believes that being significant will make girls more interested in\u00a0him but ironically, it's this emphasis on being significant/narcissistic that will lead to only more loneliness. Evident from the way that Sorkin has created Zuckerberg, this is anything but a celebration of brilliance, but rather a study in the traits of toxic masculinity such as narcissism, pride and misogyny.\n\nIn one of the most disturbing scenes of the film, Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend when it becomes obviously apparent that he is a grade A asshole and of course, Zuckerberg reacts in a way that seems logical for a male who shares parallels to the traits of toxic masculinity; he reacts by\u00a0demeaning the female who has taken a shot at his pride. Basically, he\u00a0creates a humiliating blog post about his ex and\u00a0a website that compares the 'hotness' of women to\u00a0 farm\u00a0animals as some weird, misogynist revenge tactic for his girlfriend breaking up with him. Not only is this disturbing because it shows the demeaning power of social media but also that one of the most important tools of the 21st century was born out of a night of\u00a0misogyny. It's also raising the important point of how we view these so called 'brilliant' men. Yes, Zuckerberg is intellectually brilliant but his motivations\u00a0are\u00a0misogynistic and shallow. In typical Fincher fashion, The Social Network isn't your\u00a0typical celebratory biopic, it's a film that rather investigate character qualities that\u00a0are dark, subversive and unlikable.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, there's so much to marvel about The Social Network. It could be the most perfect\u00a0synchronization between script, editing and music. The fast cut editing utilized by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall\u00a0is perfect for handling Sorkin's typical rapid-fire dialogue. in the scene mentioned above when Zuckerberg is creating a site that eventually crashes the Harvard system, the use of internal monologue provides the audience with insight to frantic and chaotic mind of a genius. As the frantic dialogue is moving at a rapid pace to capture the quickness of Zuckerberg's intelligence, the editing is just as frantic as the internal dialogue; constantly switching between Zuckerberg's monitor, various dorms rooms and a fraternity party while all being synced to Trent Renzor\u00a0and Atticus Ross' \"In Motion.\" Despite being heavy on dialogue, the movie is never boring due to the editing as Sorkin's script constantly switches between three different timelines. As the title of Renzor and Ross' track suggests, everything in this film is constantly in motion. Its also refreshing see the use of fast cut editing utilized in an intelligent manner rather than how its typically used in generic action films.\n\nIn a majority of Fincher films, the director is always subversive, challenging genre conventions and The Social Network is no exception. When we think of films that involve American colleges and fraternities, we usually think of feel\u00a0good\u00a0superficial comedies that romanticize college life and its clear Fincher is deconstructing these genre conventions by uses his dark aesthetic in a genre that is traditionally optimistic and romanticized. Fincher, a director known for his disturbing thrillers such as Seven and Zodiac, uses the exact same aesthetic he would in those thrillers for The Social Network.\u00a0Virtually every shot -- from the dorms, to the toilets, to basically any internal shot within the college -- is covered within a gloomy and disturbing palette. The aesthetic\u00a0choice makes perfect sense as Fincher isn't representing college life as a positive and romanticized notion but\u00a0rather a disturbing area riddled with toxic masculinity, narcissism and\u00a0misogyny. Besides the aesthetics, the use of music from Trent Renzor and Atticus Ross greatly contributes to the overall atmosphere. Not only do they somehow translate through music the process of programming and the feeling of an idea coming to\u00a0fruition (\"Intriguing Possibilities\") but also create a sound that is\u00a0subtly disturbing and music that perfectly matches the visual aesthetic.\n\nFrom the script, to the characters, actors, music, editing and direction, virtually all aspects of The Social Network are brilliant. Despite this, the fundamental thing that makes The Social Network live on as a classic is that at the heart of the narrative is a story of greed. In many ways, it's a 21st century adaptation of Citizen Kane as just like Charles Kane, Mark Zuckerberg rises to fame and fortune but loses everything along the way, including the only friend that cared for him. In the end, Zuckerberg doesn't have many redeeming features besides a minimal sense of remorse and Fincher ends on an ambiguous note. As we see during the final scene, Zuckerberg sends a friend request to his previous girlfriend but the film\u00a0ends before we\u00a0see if the\u00a0friend request is accepted. As the credits roll, the audience are left to ponder whether or not Zuckerberg deserves another chance to rectify his past relationship. I feel like Fincher would\u00a0take the cynical route but for a more optimistic person like myself, hopefully Zuckerberg can put his ego and pride aside and attempt to be a decent person.",

            "content": "Very few films produced in the 21st Century are able to incisively comment on how technology has effected our modern world and very few biopics manage to use their subject to make a larger statement. The Social Network manages to do both of these things as it tells an oddly compelling story in just two hours and shows you a highly unsympathetic lead who is representative of all that is wrong with our modern society and yet is very watchable. The sheer scope and ambition of the film should be enough to impress audiences but the screenplay is also smart, witty and informative and the director never strays too far from the central story while displaying an obsessive attention to detail.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Jesse Eisenberg, is left by his girlfriend Erica Albright, Rooney Mara, which prompts him to create a website Facemash that allows fellow angry male Harvard students to rank girls based on their level of attractiveness. After this website is successful he is approached by wealthy Harvard students and rowers, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Armie Hammer, to produce a social networking website for them. He creates a website on his own that carries out very similar functions to what the Winklevoss's website would have and the website's success expands with the introduction of Sean Parker, Justin Timberlake, as an investor. The Winklevosses decide to sue for theft of intellectual property but by this time Zuckerberg is so wealthy and powerful that they have no chance of really winning the lawsuit and simply receive a large settlement.\n\nMost films that focus on extremely wealthy, privileged people fighting over millions of dollars that they don't really need feel curiously detached from the real world and as though they have a lack of stakes. This film never makes us feel this way as despite despising almost all of the characters we can see why each of them would have motives to do what they do and how their upbringings have effected their attitudes towards the case. Up until the final moments of the film Zuckerberg appears to be an irredeemable human being as he has a toxic obsession with his ex-girlfriend driven more by the desire to control her than any genuine love or desire. As we watch him sit and wait for contact that is never going to come from her we see just how hopeless he is despite how far he has risen while at the same time realizing that the network he has created is so insidious that even a woman who wants nothing to do with him is wrapped up in it. The film feels like more of a satire or even a tragedy than an inspirational film or a docudrama and it benefits from it's lack of sentimentality because it is hard to see the good in the characters we witness.\n\nThe film is also paced expertly as we make huge leaps forward in time and yet never feel that we have lost anything or are very confused. Part of this may be that the main character is inert and doesn't really change despite his attainment of status and power but the director is also careful to introduce us to new situations slowly and with care. Interspersed between the scenes that explain what is occurring in real time we see moments from the negotiations between the Winklevosses and Zuckerberg where we realize yet again just how shallow and materialistic these men are while being entertained by it. The audience never loses focus because the film is always providing you with some new detail to obsess over or some strangely funny scene that doubles as a criticism of capitalism or narcissism present on social media platforms.\n\nLooking back nine years later it is incredible how much this film predicted as we witness a social platform that has largely slipped out of public favor insinuate itself into the lives of people in a way that is dangerous. Obviously what we have recently learned about Facebook and how willing they are to look into the personal affairs of their users we realize that this film was correct in predicting that a website created by a man as emotionally unstable as Zuckerberg should not serve as the primary source of communication for people.",

But this is not narrated by some average writer, Aaron Sorkin, the game changer of the screenplay writing, is in charge of these real life characters. And with director, David Fincher, the time jumps from back and forth to weave out an engaging drama in their tech-y mundane world, that actually thrives on the dorm room, unofficial chats rather than online ones or even the court trials. Your friends are thrown out like some bizarre avant garde idea while creating a website.\n\nThe stabbing in the back comes involuntarily and the exhilaration a part of the game, but amidst this game of sacrifice- not of their own but other's, elimination is a way to success, breathes the film, or so it seems on the surface- the romance to make us groove with the momentum of these characters is lacked out by keeping them distant and dry of emotions. Yes, it is practically an apt depiction, but it should have been more unbiased to make us fall for this unknown backstage world.\n\nStaring arrogantly with no empathy in his face, Jesse Eisenberg deserves the respect that he pursues so blindingly in the film. Call me childish, but I was drawn to Andrew Garfield's victimized character. In a virtually statistical world, where there is nothing or no one to actually root for, it is comforting to see Garfield broken and humanized in his porsche black suit. On the other hand, Justin Timberlake comes off disappointing where these major league players are hitting home run after home run, this is the kind of The Social Network Fincher wants you to log into, so give him your password, he is not a fraud.",

Credits as well to the score, and the editing (which I don't usually point out, but my goodness was it expertly done). Still though, I can't say that this film is a favourite of mine. My biggest problem was with the film's decision to distort its subject matter. Sure, you can change things up for the truth, and \"The Favourite\" is an example of a film that has done this impeccably well: it is so loosely based on its real story, but it tells a tale that is so finely crafted and vividly realized that you don't mind how its left out so many details (because it's not trying to tell us the truth). Here though, that difference isn't reconciled, and we're left with a film trying to tug away to explore some of its deeper themes, yet connect these fictional events to reality. I guess this may not even be the film's problem and more to do with with Zuckerberg's role as an influential figure necessitating a comparison between the film and himself. Still, though, the film hasn't tried to complexly explore any of its character's main motives other than \"I want to be famous\". It paints Zuckerberg as an eccentric figure who continuously emphasized being cool before being swayed by Sean Parker to start up ads, when Saverin suggested them in the first place? This ended up making the film incomplete, failing to expand on its full potential of being a thorough character study. Credits though to Garfield, who showcased why he's in the business. Eisenberg, was OK, but I felt his performance was one-note, not helped by the film's failure to explain the changes of his character clearly.",

Sure enough it was too good to be true. With just the simplest research, one can debunk almost the entire plot/portrayal of the movie and the characters.

After everything we have heard Zuckerberg doing with Facebook, The Social Network is all the more telling and relevant. \n\nFincher's direction is peerless without any fat or frills. It's brutally honest and stark with a modern energy not often seen in biopics. Aaron Sorkin's writing is blunt, wordy, and direct. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is pounding, refreshing, and original. It complements The Social Network's new dynamic, engaging the audience with thrilling songs while they learn to loathe Mark Zuckerberg. \n\nThe Social Network is not slander, but more so a revealing character study of a man with no morals, ethics, or conscious. It's all about his arrogance, cruelty, negligence, and vindictive personality. It feels more accurate every year and with each new anecdote we learn about Zuckerberg.\n\nJesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg is the role he was born to play. His fast talking verbal vomit of the mouth is difficult to listen to, but also exhilarating in his portrayal. He captures the lonely loser and traitorous business visionary desperate for the world's approval. The Social Network not only depicts Zuckerberg as a soulless monster, but Eisenberg embodies his failure as a human being. Zuckerberg is not a good man and Eisenberg perfectly reaches peak wretch in The Social Network.\n\nAndrew Garfield is phenomenal as Zuckerberg's once and only friend slash co-founder of Facebook: Eduardo Saverin. He delivers an earnest persona that makes you empathize with his pain and the betrayal he must have felt over Facebook and Zuckerberg. The Social Network is a condemnation of Zuckerberg, while a redemption story for Saverin.\n\nJustin Timberlake is excellent as the manic backstabber Sean Parker, founder of Napster and eventual president of Facebook. Timberlake captures the essence of a man with nothing to lose and no talent except for suggesting ideas to better men. Timberlake could have had a career as a dramatic actor, but chose mediocrity instead. At least Fincher got greatness from Timberlake for The Social Network.\n\nI liked the early cameo role from Dakota Johnson. Likewise, Rooney Mara is brilliant in The Social Network. She only gets a few lines, but they are the most memorable and biting critiques of Mark Zuckerberg to this day. You just have to see her performance in The Social Network.\n\nLastly, Armie Hammer is outstanding as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. His stern Harvard fraternity caricature is fascinating and entertaining. Hammer makes his presence known and really delivered a strong dual performance.\n\nIn short, The Social Network is going to be looked back at for its scathing depiction of Mark Zuckerberg, Eisenberg's inspired acting, Fincher's sleek direction, and Trent Reznor's wild score. The Social Network is like cocaine rushing through you directly hitting your senses.",

It is about the aspects of humanity, and what it means to be a good person. It is about the ethics of capitalism, and the downfalls of youth.\n\nI don't know anything about Mark Zuckerberg, outside of the passing information revealed in the media. However accurate or not, Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal here is fantastic. Only an introverted, borderline sociopath could accomplish something like Facebook. No one else would be willing to crush friend and foe alike in pursuit of their goal.\n\nThe Social Network could have been an incredibly dry and uninteresting film - it is a movie about the creation of a website, after all. Fincher's non-linear timeline and the musical genius of Reznor and Ross elevate the film beyond mediocre, capturing the attention of the audience and holding it until the end.\n\nThe film poses an interesting question to those that are insightful enough to see it. Is it worth it? Is owning the most successful social networking site in the world, worth billions of dollars, worth alienating everyone close to you? Is it worth going beyond awkward introvert into the territory of willful jerk?\n\nThough The Social Network may not be 100% true, the liberties that it takes are believable and applicable to real life scenarios.

However, I could only sit through the first hour as it felt like just constant bickering. I understand that when suing someone there will be a reasonable amount of arguments but every scene was jam-packed with disagreements and just watching it made me feel irritated. This sadly, took away any enjoyment I experienced watching the film and leads me to give it such a low rating. I suggest this film to people who enjoy films with a low amount of comedy and a high amount of captivating dialogue but be prepared for an incredible amount of squabbling.",

His fast-paced dialogue also goes hand-in-hand with Jesse Eisenberg's performance as Mark Zuckerberg. Sometimes you feel Jesse Eisenberg is a better Mark Zuckerberg than Mark Zuckerberg. The use of CGI is also done amazingly, namely the Winklevoss twins were done really well and I could only notice the face replacement in two shots. The performances by Jesse Eisenberg, Justin Timberlake and Andrew Garfield were also just really captivating and the conflict between Andrew's Eduardo and Jesse's Mark was acted out really well. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is also phenomenal and really give the movie this overall aesthetic and mood to it that just sucks you into the story. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is certainly an interesting one, but it is one of the most unique and best scores in the business. The synthesizer giving a game-like vibe to hacking scenes was really fun and that contrasted with calm piano for the more human scenes was done really well. Overall, The Social Network is just a great tale about what a person can lose in order to achieve success and what toll it can take on you.",

From the performances to the nuanced cinematography, everything blends together to create an atmospheric and intense drama. And it proves that David Fincher's films really are, at their cores, built from his meticulous talent, and not just from shock value and violence like some more naive critics have said in the past. There's not a single second of violence or gore. Every moment of fear comes from personal drama.\n\nAnd on a semi-related note, I'm curious as to how many people, like me, didn't realize that the Winklevoss twins were played by the same actor. Or just how much CGI was used throughout. On my first viewing I had no idea who Armie Hammer was, and I had even less of an idea as to how much of just the simple, miniscule touches were actually computer-generated.

The result is a drama rife with both creation and destruction; one that audaciously avoids a singular POV, but instead, by tracking dueling narratives, mirrors the clashing truths and constantly morphing social relationships that define our time. Drawn from multiple sources, the film captures the visceral thrill of the heady early days of a culture-changing phenomenon in the making -- and the way it both pulled a group of young revolutionaries together and then split them apart.\n\nThis is where Jesse Eisenberg strives. He not only puts on an amazing performance, but he leads a cast of amazing actors. Eisenberg perfectly captures the essence of Zuckerberg and brings out his personality so well. They're right, he is (or was, I don't know) a douche, but he's an undeniable genius who created one of the biggest companies in the world. Andrew Garfield is a fantastic supporting character who seemingly thrives in big moments. The entire cast is supported by a well rounded group of actors and they make the movie what it is.\n\nThe movie is very well directed and I'm seemingly encapsulated by the story every time I watch this film. The movie is so smart and the way the story progresses is so interesting. The journey toward the end is so riveting and it feels as though they accurately depicted this real life event in its craziest form. \n\nThe dialogue was the absolute most impressive thing about this film. From the opening scene, the movie's tone is set from the first words spoken. The dialogue is so ingenious and so beautifully written. If I can ever write a movie like this one day, I would be more than pleased with my life. This should be the line movies reach for when crafting their screenplay because this movie was written perfectly.\n\nIn the end, \"The Social Network\" is a fantastic film with little, if any flaws.",

I also have more than one account as a result of this. When FB started the movie is correct, it WAS fun and everyone was leaving myspace to be on it. I haven't been on MySpace since lol. All my friends were on there and I spent hours just chatting away and checking up on people I haven't been able to see in who knows when. I loved that part of FB! At first it was GREAT! Then came the stupid games where you had to bug the ever loving helloutta everyone just to play. They don't mention that in the movie. They don't tell how FB made so many changes or about all the drama and everyone took everything personally and how it's become nothing but an outlet for collecting data for marketing research. I knew Zuckerberg was an ass but this movie tells what led him to be such an ass. Turning on your real friends is never kewl. I knew FB was supposedly stolen from Harvard. What I didn't know was how closely FB and Napster were. If this is true then why wasn't FB involved when Napster fell? I don't remember hearing a word about it so that's why watching this and hearing how close the movie is claiming the 2 companies were was news to me. I'm the last person to take Zuckerberg's side bc he ruined a great thing from his greed. Where I use to spend hours on FB now I might go on there and see what's in my immediate feed. Click a like or 2, check on my family and get off. It's been years since I've been on there for hours as entertainment like I use to. Not bc I got bored with FB but bc it's so filled with drama I can't stand it. I take a lot of Facecations",

Given Fincher's prolific work across the board, I suppose it shouldn't surprise me but the man who has made a name for himself in recent years due to his impressive work with less than impressive material has done it again. As with Gone Girl, there isn't much to the Facebook story, especially considering how much is locked behind non-disclosure agreements and the statements of current Facebook employees. Given this and the inherently anti-social nature of the early days of coding and creation, Fincher and a fantastic soundtrack team manage to really put some urgency and tension behind the plot. In addition to a technically perfect soundtrack, Fincher finds exceptionally creative ways to cut between time periods and locations in ways that are both effective and build momentum for the film. Combined with a truly exceptional cast headed by Eisenberg at his career best, The Social Network is a technically perfect film and clearly as good of a treatment as this story will ever receive. As is the case with Gone Girl, the question remains however, how impactful will this film be in the long term? Fincher's Fight Club and Se7en to a lesser degree are incredibly influential classics and Fight Club especially continues to dominate pop culture and the movie making process. Fincher's recent films however have less of this factor and I think The Social Network, a movie commonly found in five dollar bins and pawn shops, is a great example. Ironically, like social media itself, the film's topic is already going out of style. For those unfamiliar with the early days of Facebook and unconnected to those first profile incarnations, the movie is going to seem pretty pointless (again ironic considering the movie's commentary on people's rapidly changing attitudes). Beyond some fairly basic (if extremely well acted and written) concepts of friendship, narcissism, the fleeting attention spans of this generation, the cutthroat nature of business and the challenges of genius level intellects, the film doesn't offer the broad spectrum unifying themes that movies like Gladiator, Lord of the Rings, The Dark Knight and The Departed feature, themes that can connect to many different generations, including those far into the future. These same themes cause repeat viewings, a phenomenon that has a real impact on film industry trends as well. Undeniably, The Social Network is a great film, perfectly constructed and perfectly executed but unfortunately, as is the nature of its subject, its shelf life is limited and its relevance even more so. It's a movie worth watching but certainly a movie that won't be watched a second time.",

Are you kidding?  Certainly not worthy but disappointingly true.  It is a great example on how the Academy fails almost constantly to award art rather than simply to vote along with the industry \"groupthink\" that drives the studios, their industry, keeps food on their table and fuel in their Mercedes.\n\nThis is a hugely inaccurate film and has been attested so by every real life character depicted.  The film itself is mediocre.  Why is this so well regarded by critics?  I have no clue.\n\nIt has certainly not held well over time.  This is because time has a way to separate the best from the worst, to reward those things that were ignored and pull down those who were rewarded.  This is the case with so many things in life, as well as in film.  The truth of the matter is, this is simply not a great film.

Now while he started off on the wrong foot with the studio interfered Alien3, he went on to make many AMAZING films such as Fight Club, Zodiac, Seven & of course the film i'm about to review: The Social Network. A film not only understandably accused of not being FACTUAL to the creator of Facebook or neither it's creation, but also brought actor Jesse Eisenberg & talented writer Aaron Sorkin (who went on to write yet another great autobiography Steve Jobs) to the Hollywood spotlight. Ok so with all that context put in, i did finally get to see the film, and do i think it's praiseworthy as many critics gave it and do i enjoy it as a fan of Fincher's filmography? Oh yeah, ABSOLUTELY to both of those questions. Like many films that i rarely give super high praise to, this film made me VERY invested not just in the film's story and flow that even as i was evaluating issues to point out, i couldn't fine none or little to talk with. However, while only one VERY minor nitpick with the film's fictional approach on Mark Zuckerberg's life can't be overlooked when you do look at his actual biography, like I said, this IS only one minor nitpick. Other than that, everything else in the film excels with: A wonderfully talented cast and stand out performances from Andrew Garfield & of course Jessie Eisenberg, fantastic camerawork and cinematography from veteran David Fincher, a great pace that gives admirable time to develop each character motivation and ark they have through the whole story, an almost fantastic soundtrack by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, a well developed and heavily detailed scrip and story by Aaron Sorkin, surprisingly well done editing (which is something i rarely comment on but in this worked SUPER well), minor touches such as natural lighting and sound design in certain scenes & overall is a entertaining and heavily well told film. So yeah, OF COURSE go see this film. It's definitely worth your time whether your looking for a film to kill 2 hours of your time or if your a fan of David Fincher. Or comedically if you want to get the disgusting taste of Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luther from 'Batman V Superman' out of your mouth.",

David Fincher directing what seemingly everyone called \"that facebook movie\" is one of those situations.\n\nI feel like I could go on and on for at least sixty pages about how beautifully this film is shot. Fincher's perfectionist \"one-hundred takes of every scene or bust\" mentality along with Jesse Eisenberg's detached, overtly-cynical portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg meld well together on giving the film a platform for the remaining cast and story to set itself up on. The film's genius and well-calculated approach is further enhanced by casting somebody who i'd previously not believed to be a good actor in even the slightest.  Justin Timberlake's portrayal of Napster co-founded Sean Parker was shockingly well-acted. It's a classic case of a former teen idol proving to the world that he has more to offer than just choreography-laden arena shows and a new album every four years that really only suburban moms know about. Timberlake does to a shockingly decent job of portraying Parker as a former high school geek turned internet entrepreneur turned cast-out wannabe-rockstar who acts as the Lennon to Eisenberg's and Garfield's McCartneys to a point.\n\nAside from the rockstar antics of Silicon Valley net heads (about 20 years too late to use that term?), and an admittedly detailed portrayal of both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss by Armie Hammer, the film's biggest focus-point isn't about Facebook at all; instead it's focus is on how money and an astounding wave of success on a billion dollar idea can drive two close friends apart - well, that and the stigma surrounding the whole Finals club thing, but that really isn't that important right here and now.  \n\nEisenberg's Zuckerberg and Garfield's Saverin feed off each other quite well in terms of dynamic. Both think of themselves as quite capable as making it in real life (they go to Harvard, for the sake of all that is good and pure) except for the socializing and love department, at least at the start of the film. They're desperate to leave their handprints on the world despite Zuckerberg here being too full of himself and cynicism to admit such. And that's the beauty of the Social Network, there's no teary goodbyes, no happy ending all around, and no resolution of the main conflict. Facebook is only a fulcrum in the film's true plot line of how a subtle behind-the-scenes Battle Royale for control over a world-changing idea can rip people apart in a seemingly irreparable way.",

He plays the co-creator, Eduardo Saverin. It would be long to just list all the actors here, so I'll just say that the rest of the cast was superb, as well. I really enjoyed following the story of Mark since his high-school days. Also, the opening scene set the mood perfectly for the rest of the movie. The main problem I have with biographical movies is the ending. I never know how it's going to end, especially if the person isn't dead yet. The Theory of Everything did a great job with the ending, but with The Social Network I felt like something was missing. It just ended when I expected to see more.

After a few months the project was realized and ready to begin filming. \n\nThe Social Network is the story about how in 2003, a 19-year-old Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg, with the help of Eduardo Saverin, Chris Hughes and Dustin Moskovitz created a website called \"thefacebook\", where the people could made a personal profile to contact with other people. Also the film show us the personal feelings of the protagonists respect to the great change in their lives and the judgment in 2004 between Zuckerberg, Saverin and the Winklevoss brothers.\n\nThe director David Fincher is extraordinary, perhaps his best work so far, he is the man in charge here and knows how to make everything look good. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross were the composers and they made the right music, I think is the best original score of 2010.\n\nJesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg is excellent, demonstrating us that knows how to deal with a protagonist serious role, the rising star Andrew Garfield as Saverin is very good too but not better than the before mentioned, and the rest of the cast is just ok, Justin Timberlake stands out for being convincing in his character of Sean Parker or Roney Mara with just a few minutes on screen show us that she is a good actress.\n\nThe cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth and the edition by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall are perfect in every way, the viewer can notice it from the first minute of the picture. 7/10",

            "content": "2010 has been a great year for films. There have been some truly groundbreaking works of art and films which have set the bar high for action and drama alike. Bear that in mind when I tell you that The Social Network outshines them all. This thinking may come heavily opposed but the fact is that you're not likely to see another film as perfectly cast, written, acted or directed for a long time, and it's been a long time since we have. Based upon the book The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, The Social Network revolves around the creation one of the biggest websites of all time: Facebook and its creator, Mark Zuckerberg.\u00a0\n\nOne of the greatest things about this film is Aaron Sorkin's script. Writer of A Few Good Men, The American President and the brilliant TV series The West Wing, Sorkin's incredibly rapid-fire script sparkles with a witty fury which dares you to keep up. Even West Wing watchers will find it difficult to catch every line without the occassional one flying over their heads. His conversations often go three different ways at once until they become suddenly, rivettingly intense and it's impossible to look away from the screen. It's been three years since we've seen one of Sorkin's scripts in action and it's fantastic to see that not only has he not lost his touch, he's getting better and better as the years go on.\u00a0\n\nDavid Fincher has already established himself as an amazing director and in this film he shows himself to be an auteur of the highest calibre. His fantastic depth of field with every shot shows his incredible attention to detail and the way he manipulates his onscreen images in order to affect his audience. With an incredible CV of films including The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Se7en and the monumental Fight Club, The Social Network is one of his finest yet. His use of shots shows an understanding of the audience which is lacking in many films and a talent missing in many of today's directors. His signature bronze murky colouring to every shot makes for startling comparisons between deposition scenes, smoky bars and booming night-clubs.\u00a0\n\nThe music is fantastic, a great blend of old school and new school tracks, as well as some well placed classical pieces which all come together brilliantly. The original score for the film is beautifully restrained, fitting perfectly in the brighter scenarios and the darker ones, a beautiful melancholy piece which you'll be humming all the way home from the cinema.\u00a0\n\nAnd the acting. Cast to perfection, everyone on screen performs their role brilliantly. Jesse Eisenberg is amazing as Mark, speeding through his lines as if it's a race to the end of every sentence, it's as if he's been tailor made to Aaron Sorkin's needs. Finally being given the role he deserves and one which showcases his incredible talent, Eisenberg makes the most of his part, playing it perfectly. Armie Hammer is fantastic as the Winklevi as well as Max Minghella as Divya Narendra. The next Lisbeth Salander, Rooney Mara, is one of the standouts of the cast, magnetic in her limited screen time as Erica Albright. She has the steely determination and vulnerability perfect for her role and she rattles off her lines with a disarming realism. Mr. Multi-talent himself, Justin Timberlake, is incredible as Sean Parker, speaking with infinite charm and manipulation with equal parts comedy and smoothness. But it's Andrew Garfield who is the real standout here, which is saying something in a cast this fantastic. He is convincingly real in everything he does, from the very finest detail. He is perfectly restrained throughout the film, even though his temper comes to boil well before the incredible climax. His performance is perfectly judged and always convincing. With any hope it'll be his year for an Oscar nod.\u00a0\n\nThese parts by themselves are incredible but the way they all come together seamlessly and breathakingly is the reason that this film is being talked about so much. You'd be hard pressed to find a better combination of a cast, director and writer anywhere in film history, nor a film with such incredible content, perfect pacing and astonishing set pieces where the dialogue is more explosive than the Die Hard box set. I'm gonna say it right now: instant classic. It may be a big call but if any film is worthy of it, it's this one.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nMark returns from The Thirsty Scholar to do a little intoxicated blogging. And crashes Harvard's network at 4:00am.",

It is a movie based on a true story, and many of the things that happen in the film truly happened. But the characterizations, the motivations, are all part of the storytelling. This is a fictionalized, dramatized account of true events, made that way to not only make the movie more entertaining and captivating and to create tension and drama, but to make those broader social statements and themes ever more prevalent.\n\nThere is a scene near the end of David Fincher's The Social Network that succinctly sums up what the entire movie is about in one poignant moment. Eduardo Saverin, the former best friend of Mark Zuckerberg and CFO of Facebook, has just been pushed aside and manipulated by Zuckerberg and his fledgling company, having his holding interest in the company drop from 30% to .03%; his shares were the only ones diluted as new shareholders came into Facebook. Saverin is essentially no longer a part of Facebook, and, in anger and despair, has an emotionally charged personal exchange with Zuckerberg that digs into all of the personal issues the two of them have had throughout the entire film. Their jealousies and rivalries come to a head. Business and personal endeavors should always be separate, but when you and your best friend create a company worth billions of dollars, the lines can be easily blurred, and someone will inevitably be hurt or left behind.\n\nThis is really what The Social Network is about. The film is about the rivalry between two friends and about how power and manipulation eventually tear them apart. Mark Zuckerberg is made out to be a young man who excels online and in his business endeavors but who absolutely fails in his personal life. The opening credits sequence shows Zuckerberg, after being dumped by his girlfriend, running through the snowy streets of Harvard, past all of the huddled masses of people, into his dorm room to find the safety and companionship of his personal computer. At the end of the film, after Saverin leaves him after being kicked out of Facebook and Sean Parker, whom Zuckerberg idolized from first meeting, jeopardizes Facebook after being caught with cocaine at a party, we see Mark sitting in a chair by his computer, alone and sad, knowing that he is extremely successful, but also knowing that in the process of becoming so, he pushed everyone away that ever mattered to him.\n\nIn this way, The Social Network is both a warning against the perils of pushing friends aside for personal success in business and an observation on the direction that society nowadays is headed: that people are now feeling more comfortable in the digital world than in the real one, and would rather communicate with their \"friends\" online rather than be with them in person. Like Zuckerberg in the film, we as a society may be headed toward personal despair if we let ourselves be pulled completely into the digital world.\n\nFincher's film is masterfully constructed. Every aspect of it is intelligently thought-out and marvelously executed with a quality of craft that is remarkable. The script by Aaron Sorkin wonderfully bounces back and forth between court proceedings with actual events, retaining humor and heart amidst a story of revenge and personal failure and success. Sorkin's dialogue, delivered with rapid-fire conviction by the wonderful ensemble cast, is wordy and witty. There are sequences of great technical prowess in The Social Network. The whole movie looks beautiful. The music, acting, writing, directing, editing, cinematography, and everything else about the film is phenomenal. The Social Network is as entertaining and fast-paced as its wonderfully worded dialogue and as deep and exacting as its pure and exacting performances.",

He's like Sheldon Cooper from \"The Big Bang Theory\" but without the self-awareness or the humour. The movie focuses on two lawsuits against Zuckerberg. One is launched by a couple of Harvard classmates who claim they had the Facebook idea first and hired Zuckerberg to program it, but he stole the idea and did it better. The other lawsuit is from Facebook's first CFO, who claimed he was deliberately pushed out of the company by Zuckerberg's new best friend, the self-promoting Shaun Parker, who invented Napster and mentored Facebook to stellar expansion and growth. In between legal depositions, we see flashbacks of Facebook's early days.\n\nThe film is anchored by strong performances from the entire cast. The film wisely focuses on the more dramatic business side of the company rather than on the geeky computer side. I expect some liberties have been taken for dramatic effect, so I'd be wary of treating this as history. It's more a character study of someone who encounters phenomenal success but still doesn't quite get why people still don't like him.",

            "content": "It's hard to think that a film about the creator of Facebook would be an all time classic and one of, if not, the best David Fincher film there is, but believe it. I remember the slack this film got prior to its release, one note excuses about  how bad a film it would be, \"Why would anyone want to watch a film about facebook?\" cried many people. Even to this day there are still people, who havent seen this movie and have no desire to because of the afformentioned. Let me tell you right here, that not only is this film a master class in film making, it is also a perfect example of kinetic and free flowing story telling during a long period of time. This film is about the relationship between Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saveron, 2 friends a school, who after a bit of persuading by Mark, decide to create a website that could potentially make them big news within the school. Unknown to Saveron, the idea was based on identical twins, the Winkelvoss's and Divien Horrendra's idea for a web page called the Harvard Connection, which Mark used the basis off to create the hit page we all know and most likely have our own profiles on by now. The film documents the 2 ongoing court cases against Zuckerberg, while also documenting the rise of facebook and the deterioration of relationships around Zuckerberg as he becomes the worlds youngest billionaire. Sounds like a lot to cover in one movie? It is, but it is executed perfectly with a style and pace that just hurtles towards the finish line, giving you no time at all to breathe. You are constantly thrown between flashbacks, court cases and of the time situations continually. Not to mention the score, which ill touch on in a bit, which just keeps the whole thing bouncing until the final moments. The acting is beyond perfect, the cast of this film is perfect. Jesse Essenberg is brutally hilarious, smart and just the right amount of weird to pull of Zuckerberg, there are small blink and you will miss them moments where his attention is only on the job at hand his surroundings matter little to him, in one scene he runs through a mass of snow in flip flops in order to get back to  his dorm to add a line of code to facebook, its moments like this that make this film so addictive. Andrew Garfield is on fire and delivers the films most riveting performance, not only does he own the screen everytime hes on it, not only does he work amazingly well with Jesse as friends but he totally envelops the entire film, every scene he is in is just a wonder to watch. Justin Timberlake plays Sean Parker, the founder of Napster, who manages to sweep Zuckerberg off his feet and he does it with the style and panache that only Timberlake could deliver. Armie Hammer is excellent as both Winklevoss and Rooney Mara, for what time she has, is majestic as Zuckerbergs slight love interest. All of this would be polish were it not for Aaron Sorkins top notch script. Very few people do dialogue well but here, the script is brutal, whitty, challenging, intellectual and just so fast paced. It doesnt bog you down with needless shit, it hits it all perfectly and the actors deliver these lines just how they should be. This is testament to Finchers shooting style of around 50 takes per scene, at least. The look of the film is gorgeous, the colour is beyond glorious and the entire grade gives the film an eerie atmosphere. The real champion here though is the score. This film is genius without it, anything could have went over the top here and it wouldnt have lessend the experience. However Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross deliver a soundtrack that totally fires the film into stratospheric territory. No wonder they won an oscar for it, it adds an emotional weight to the entire piece that just has you completely hooked, body and soul. This film is my favourtie movie by Fincher, its smart, enjoyable, gorgeous, kinetic and dark. I  honestly cannot think of one bad thing to say about this movie, there is nothing bad about it. It works, on every level, buy, watch, talk about it, recommend it. This is a classic.",

The movie moves from the halls of Harvard to the cubicles of Palo Alto to capture the heady early days of a culture-changing phenomenon in the making--and the way it both pulled a group of young revolutionaries together and then split them apart. In the midst of the chaos are Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the brilliant Harvard student who conceived a Web site; Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), once Zuckerberg's close friend, who provided the seed money for the fledgling company; Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who brought Facebook to Silicon Valley's venture capitalists; and the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence), the Harvard classmates who asserted that Zuckerberg stole their idea and then sued him for ownership of it. Each has his own narrative, his own version of the Facebook story in this multi-level portrait of 21st Century success--both the youthful fantasy of it and its finite realities as well.\n\nThis movie has probably the best screen plays from Aaron Sorkin its just so good.\n\nOnce again this movie is beautifully shot of course from David Fincher\n\nThis was all his styles Mixed into One Movie.\n\nThe Cast\n\nJesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg - Jesse is a fantastic actor I think he is very underrated today he plays a perfect Asshole in this movie, but when you see when he does you understand why and realize oh i guess he is right.\n\n Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin - EASILY Garfields best movie and performance yes even better than Spider-Man, he should have been Nominated for Best Supporting Actor and would have easily won if Christian Bale didn't win even though he wasn't a supporting actor. He has very big Darkness to his character.\n\nJustin Timberlake as Sean Parker - Yes Even Timberlake is fantastic\n\nArmie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss - He was good too its his only great film since his film list is all shit except this.\n\nBrenda Song as Christy Lee - She was ehh ok as a psycho groupie didn't really think she was needed.\n\nRashida Jones as Marylin Delpy - she is great.\n\nEven though Mark Zuckerberg has denied all of this, but who cares its still a fantastic movie.\n\nOverall: I love this movie there were some stuff not needed, but this is one of David Finchers most respected films.\n\nOverall Grade: A",

I thought this is interesting, with a bunch of young people wants to be billionaires by making a social networking site for teenagers and ends up banging hot chicks together, drugs and more scandals. Well for some it's more of a cliche but I think this is one of those films that will serve as an inspiration to those people who starts at nothing. Fincher does the most impressive job overall. The performances are top notch as well as the screenplay. Though this is not for everyone thinking the film has no heart at all, but if you just focus the depth to the whole plot. It is something. It's smart which has a lot of humor which needs multiple viewing for some.",

        {
            "content": "At the outset I'll say The Social Network is a modern classic. David Fincher is a masterful director, and his attention to detail and well-known penchant for requiring 20 plus shots per take, have resulted in an incredibly polished product. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is funny, moving, and tells a story that focuses on the character that created Facebook, as opposed to being a factual portrait of dates, events and people, leading to the popular sites launch and the legal aftermath that followed. The cast is superb, especially Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield , and I'll admit to being pleasantly surprised by how effective Justin Timberlake's contribution was.\n\nA movie like The Social Network was inevitable. You don't create a web site with over 500 million users, and become a billionaire in just a few short years without drawing some attention to yourself. That kind of success must also warp public opinion both positively, and negatively. It attracts media attention, generates comments irregardless of any genuine research on the subject, and becomes fodder for others to profit from.\n\nThe movie is a fiction, loosely based on events that lead to the creation of the largest 'social network' the world currently knows. Ironically created by a character that by most people's estimations, probably suffers from Aspergers. The movie version of Mark Zuckerberg is awkward, arrogant and seemingly incapable of feeling empathy. He's also emotionally vulnerable, and despite the incredible popularity of his social project, finds himself alone, relying on his creation to make human connections.\n\nThe only minor issue I have with the film is with its insistence on labeling Zuckerberg a genius. Which likely stems from my understanding of the technology being used on the site since being a web developer by day allows me to put a roof over my head, and blog about all these wonderful movies at night! Facebook.com is a website, nothing more. Okay, it's a huge popular web site, that's clear, and it certainly was created by very clever programmers and engineers. But we're also talking about a website that was a variation of other social platforms already available at the time, and based on and idea that arguably wasn't entirely Zuckerberg's own. So when the movie juxtaposes Zuckerberg with Bill Gates, I can't decide if Sorkin is trying to say Gates is a genius, and Zuckerberg is the next generation. Or he's saying they are similar because history shows Bill Gates' success was less about genius level thinking, and more a mixture of talent, being in the right place at the right time, and business tenacity.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you're curious about how Facebook got started, don't rely on this film for information. Watch it if you're in the mood for a great looking film that's well made, written and performed.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is a gorgeously shot and edited film with an Oscar winning score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, and if the opportunity to watch this at a theater near you opens up, certainly try to view this on the big screen. At home a HD viewing on a nice big TV is recommended. Watching this on anything smaller will ruin the impact of the film.\n\nBest Moment:\n\nI've watched The Social Network several times now, and I've also watched Citizen Kane a few times too. My favorite moment in The Social Network is right up there with the classic opening shot of Citizen Kane, when Kane drops the snow-globe and we hear the word 'Rosebud.'\n\nAt the end of The Social Network, Mark Zuckerberg, the man with over 500 million people using his website, is all alone in front of his laptop. He searches for a girl he used to date, Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) and sends her a 'friend request.' He then sits there, repeatedly refreshing the web page to see if she's responded as the camera slowly zooms in. As Kane's last word speaks of a lost childhood, Zuckerberg's last action of the film comments on his inability to make a proper human connection.\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/the-social-network-2010/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Although the story is about college boys setting up a social network and the resulting conflicts that it ends up causing didn\u00e2(TM)t sound too interesting to me on the surface and the fact that the film did stretch itself on for a while with some repetitive moments, The Social Network ended up impressing me at just how well it could tell a story because it put a lot of depth and tension into the tale and rendered it a meaningful and compelling piece of cinema.\nThere was no way for me to tell that there was so much depth behind the creation of Facebook, but The Social Network did it excellently. Through the power of an ambitious script which is intelligent and dramatic with a nice touch of comedy, The Social Network manages to intelligently convey to audiences how the creation of a revolutionary website came to fruition and how it affected everybody involved. The language is impressive because although it makes use of a lot of complex terms and rushes by throughout the film, audiences are easily able to understand everything that the characters are talking about and just what the meaning is of what they are saying. The ambitious scope that Aaron Sorkin goes for in his script manages to capture many years of development into the creation of Facebook and also brings the characters to life in an excellent dramatization and re-enactment of everything that is happening, and under the fierce direction of David Fincher it manages to reach incredible heights of success. Frankly, I was very impressed with just how much The Social Network was able to offer in terms of storytelling because of the limited concept behind it, and the fact that it held my interest with intense, fast paced storytelling was just exceptional. The Social Network is one of those films which leaves a viewer examining just what kind of strength a film can use to tell a story when the creators have a true passion for it, and although it does deviate from the real life events as does every film biopic, it manages to create consistently interesting and complex themes and concepts to go with its characters, rendering it a very good film.\nBut the reason that The Social Network stands so tall is because of the fact that the cast in the film manage to take full advantage of the characters presented to them and turn the film into an unforgettable front for the talents of a large and versatile list of actors.\nJesse Eisenberg is perfect for the role of Mark Zuckerberg because he captures the neuroticism of the character by contributing his own. Although a character like his tends to usually be a nerdy archetype who talks himself around and out of complex situations, the role of the character Mark Zuckerberg is a lot more complex than anybody could have honestly expected. The man is a genius, and with Jesse Eisenberg\u00e2(TM)s talent for swift and powerful line delivery, he takes on the role and gives it his maximum skill as an actor which is thoroughly impressive. Jesse Eisenberg captures the relentless dedication to achievement which would turn Mark Zuckerberg into the world\u00e2(TM)s youngest billionaire with extraordinary ease, and it combines all of his best talents as an actor which manifests itself into his best performance to date. Jesse Eisenberg gives a meaningful and compelling portrayal behind the man that created Facebook, and he carries the entire film from start to finish. \nAndrew Garfield gives a breakthrough performance in The Social Network. The most important aspects of his performance come from the way that he interacts with Jesse Eisenberg as the relationships between their characters Eduardo Saverin and Mark Zuckerberg because the chemistry they share manifests itself into a seriously tense conflict.  The scenes they share together are powerful, and Andrew Garfield shows off the kind of tense emotional strength he carries as an actor when he sees fit.  Andrew Garfield\u00e2(TM)s performance in The Social Network is impressive, and his interactions with the many surrounding cast members reveal what his natural talents are all about.\nJustin Timberlake is an actor that I find myself gradually growing to like, and I don\u00e2(TM)t think I\u00e2(TM)ve seen him give a better performance than his role as Sean Parker in The Social Network. The thing is that his character is very confident and essentially fearless in his goal to be the best, and the kind of determination that Justin Timberlake channels into the role is just great. Justin Timberlake projects a lot of natural charisma in his role as Sean Parker and capitalises on the opportunity very well, guiding himself to an impressive performance and his chemistry with Jesse Eisenberg has them challenging the wits of each other very well.\nArmie Hammer also makes a great dual role as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss because he seamlessly creates two characters which leaves the audience easily believing that the two of them are actually portrayed by separate actors. Using visual techniques, David Fincher is able to create the illusion of two characters, and through his natural acting charisma Armie Hammer manages to easily portray the two of them. He created a chemistry with himself which is challenging to do, but he does it very easily, and the determined nature of his line delivery and simple sense of strength that he supplies to the role prove to be more than enough for him to give a successful performance in The Social Network.\nRadisha Jones also makes a memorable supporting effort.\n\nSo although it doesn't feel 100% genuine and it does sometimes have a slight feeling of repetition, The Social Network is a powerfully acted and well scripted story which breathes depth into the complicated events regarding the creation of one of the world's most recognised websites.",

Due to my interest in coding and stuff I can relate to this film and really see the struggle and hard Work behind it by the real people. This was also written very smartly.

That a story about a fairly unlikeable man who created a website could be turned into such a fascinating film is evidence enough to the talent that flows through director David Fincher, writer Aaron Sorkin and the talented cast at hand.\n\nFull review at http://silverscreenfanatic.com/2014/05/06/benjamins-stash-18/",

Or The Newsroom? They're very indulgent dialogue wise and become frustrating in the character development department. Here, however, Aaron holds back and actually plots out a better narrative that ironically turned into a Citizen Kane-like accomplishment. Well done!

The acting isn't amazing, but it's decent. The cinematography was cool. The editing was perfect. But the pace was very slow. To me it dragged on and on. Jesse Eisenberg was better in the (2013) film, Now you see me. I felt that his performance and acting wasn't natural enough. Something seemed forced for him as an actor. He may have done his lines well and followed the script well. But he didn't do much for the  character. I thought Rooney Mara did a better performance than him. She was playing the role of Marks' girlfriend, which was a side character. This film was decent, but the execution of the film was just alright. It wasn't like Now you see me. In that film, Eisenberg did more with his character, a more professional and creative side of him was seen. When you're playing a person in real life, it has to come natural, or at least seem natural. This didn't happen. In Eisenberg's case, he should stick with films that have roles that aren't real people in real life, it's just a character in a film.\nAll in all, The Social Network isn't a bad film, if you're into after you've rented it or seen it at the movie theaters, then by all means, buy it.",

            "content": "I have no idea how to start this review of The Social Network. What can you say about a movie that is so entirely well made? So entirely entertaining? So entirely impressive? I don't know ... I mean, other than the obvious. Looking at The Social Network as a movie (and a piece of entertainment), there's nothing bad you can say about it. What holds the movie back, in my opinion, is the lack of \"true\" in this \"true story.\" I know the liberties that director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin take make the movie more cinematic and interesting; but that still doesn't change the fact that much of this movie is not, in fact ... fact.\r\n\r\n\"The Facebook Movie\" as it's too often called, chronicles the rise of genius Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg, creator of the Book of Faces. After gaining the attention of two rich, athletic,  and smart twins, Mark is tasked with creating a website. The Winklevoss twins want Mark to create a website Harvard Connection, a social network/dating site exclusive to Harvard students. Zuckerberg takes this seed of an idea, and grows it into Thefacebook. He partners up with his best (and only) friend, Eduardo. The site is launched, and it takes off. It becomes popular, incredibly so. But then greed and success begin to poison things. Lawsuits ensue, and Mark is put through the ringer.\r\n\r\nThe incidents that are shown in the movie are mostly true, but almost everything around that seems padded, if not entirely false. Real-world Zuckerberg isn't as much of a condescending jerk as he's portrayed in the movie. Justin Timberlake's performance as Sean Parker is supposedly exactly opposite of how Parker is in real life. Andrew Garfield's character, Eduardo Saverin, said of the movie, \"the movie was clearly intended to be entertainment and not a fact-based documentary.\" Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin even said, \"I don't want my fidelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to storytelling.\" \r\n\r\nWhich isn't necessarily a bad thing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy watching Justin Timberlake play an arrogant know-it-all. I relish every opportunity to see Jessie Eisenberg play a condescending genius. I want Andrew Garfield to be able to give a dramatic performance, even if the events aren't entirely true. To take The Social Network as a piece of entertainment, I want and enjoy everything this movie has to offer. But as a piece of supposed \"truth,\" I am just a bit put off by the liberties the filmmakers take. But just a bit, as you can tell by the fact that I'm giving this movie 10% less than a perfect score. \r\n\r\nThe script, other than the fact that it doesn't follow the true story very well, is truly excellent! The dialogue crackles with intelligence and wit! This fictionalized take on Mark Zuckerberg is really fun. Eisenberg does so well with the role, because it specifically plays into his strengths.\r\n\r\nAnd why not take this time to talk about the acting. Jessie Eisenberg is such a talented guy. He can deliver these lines with so much humor, when its needed. He can also portray real, genuine drama. He received a well deserved Academy Award nomination for this role. This is the kind of transformative movie that can change \"comedy nerd version infinity\" into \"Jessie Eisenberg, the actor.\" And now, he's tackling the massive challenge of playing a non-conventional version of Lex Luther in Batman vs. Superman. I'm excited, more power to him!\r\n\r\nMatching Eisenberg talent for talent is Spider-Man himself, Andrew Garfield. He gives the very best performance of the movie (which is saying a whole lot) as Eduardo. Garfield is terrific! He makes the whole thing so much more human. Eduardo is definitely the most \"I'm rooting for this guy\" character in the movie. Because he isn't a jerk. He doesn't exploit other people. He is a man of character. The scene where Eduardo verbally assaults Mark after finding out that he was cheated out of all his stock in the company is especially phenomenal. It's a truly superb performance! \r\n\r\nThe supporting cast honestly doesn't have a weak link. Justin Timberlake brings it as Sean Parker. Even if the real life character was totally different, Timberlake's performance is still stellar! I does feel just a bit like Justin Timberlake playing ... Justin Timberlake. But that's fine! Armie Hammer is very strong as the Winklevoss twins. I really hope The Lone Ranger doesn't torpedo his career. Also watch for Rooney Mara in a small, but essential part.\r\n\r\nDavid Fincher's direction is just astounding. There isn't a single negative thing to say about 95% of the production. The top-notch editing and cinematography are big standouts.\r\n\r\nBut the 5% of the production side of things that I didn't like is the musical score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. I guess it kind of, sort of fits the movie decently. Still, the same sound could have been achieved to much better effect by Cliff Martinez. The Reznor and Ross score is grating and almost unbearable outside of the film. I usually listen to the musical score of a movie when I'm reviewing said movie, but I just couldn't with this one. I tried, but the music is so obnoxious, I found my writing was greatly suffering from listening to such intolerable rubbish. And the most infuriating thing about it? This simplistic and unpleasant score won the Academy Award over John Powell's flawless score to How To Train Your Dragon.\r\n\r\nOverall, minus the horrible score and the bit-too-fictionalized story, you have one of the \"coolest\" movies you'll ever see! The story is never, ever boring. The comedy and drama play out naturally and in satisfying amounts. And the movie is anchored by two outstanding performances by Eisenberg and Garfield. What David Fincher was able to accomplish with The Social Network is possibly the definitive movie for this generation. Generation Y. Our generation.\r\n\r\n\"The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink.\" 9/10",

            "content": "The late, great JW famously referred to The Social Network as one of the worst movies ever made. Well, it just goes to show you how much of a moron JW was. The Social Network, the most critically-acclaimed film from one of my favorite directors (David Fincher), isn't quite the rip-roaring ride of action, drama, grit, and intrigue that one would expect from the director of Fight Club and Seven, but it's still one of the best dramatizations of a mundane world event ever conceived. It takes real talent to make a website being created entertaining, but hell, I was enthralled through virtually the whole thing.\r\n\r\nThe Social Network is the story of how Mark \"Fuckerberg\" Zuckerberg ripped off the Winklevoss twins and created Facebook, the greatest disservice to American culture since the invention of communism. One would think that such a detestable main character, coupled with a putrid story, would result in a mess of a film. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. Fincher is an expert at working with antiheroes, as he's proven before with the charismatic yet insane Tyler Durden. Here he isn't allowed to go to town as much as one would like, but he still manages to make Zuckerberg (played by a perfectly cast Jesse Eisenberg) both charismatic and cunning, two traits that the real-life Fuckerberg lacks. Using his geeky charm and warped world view, the character is able to reel the audience in in a Richard III, Frank Underwood, or Walter White kind of way, forcing us to participate in the enjoyment of his misdeeds and excess, and thusly making us accomplices to his crimes of intellectual property theft. Okay, it's not a perfect comparison, because... well... this guy made a website and Walter White cooked meth to provide for his family. Still, you get the point.\r\n\r\nAlthough Facebook is absolutely evil, the concept is a sound business plan. And the audience already knows the outcome of these events, which makes the scenes in which Zuckerberg steals the idea all the more motivating and enjoyable. Still, the movie never quite breaks past the bonds of \"people just talking,\" and doesn't quite strike a chord on a more emotional level than that. Sure, plagiarism is bad. We get it. You need to have a more interesting message than that if you expect people to keep their asses planted firmly in their seats for two hours. Still, the cast charms, and the story itself is such an amazingly ludicrous-- not to mention true-- tale that it's impossible not to be sucked in.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for The Social Network: 7/10 stars. It's not quite on-par with Fincher's more over-the-top work, but instead of relying on visceral thrills and pulse-pounding tension, this movie relies on its ingenious, David Mamet-style script and strong performances to keep the pressure building, all the while showcasing an antihero with a woefully misguided moral compass who, against all odds, manages to constantly stay one step ahead of his detractors. In fact, that might be the message of The Social Network right there: In the business world, you don't have to be liked. You don't even have to be tolerated. You just have to win. And as much as I hate his guts, Mark Fuckerberg has won fair and square, making buttloads of cash off of \"his\" idea and becoming one of the youngest billionaires of all time. No, he is not a good person. But yes, this is a good story.",

            "content": "Imagine a world with no Facebook. It's pretty unbelievable isn't it. It has made such an impact on contemporary society that for most people, it becomes a necessity. The point of the social networking site is to see what your \"friends\" are doing and bring each other closer together. After watching this film, I found that idea to be pretty ironic.\n\nThe Social Network was based on a novel by Ben Mezrich entitled \"The Accidental Billionaires\". The book was adapted by screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, who has made a name for himself with works like A Few Good Men, The West Wing, and Moneyball. Currently this is the only product that I have seen from him, so I cannot comment on the trademarks and styles that he commonly employs in his films. I can definitely say that he has written a wonderful script. The Social Network touches on the themes of friendship, betrayal, social acceptance, pride, and success. The film could have focused on the much bigger idea, the origin, success and impact of Facebook. Instead Sorkin wanted the film to be more personal and intimate. I cannot say how much of the film is accurate to reality or to the source material, as I am ignorant of Facebook or Zuckerberg's story. The Social Network focuses on it's creator, Mark Zuckerberg. It details about the beginnings of the product , and what's surprising about it was that it didn't take the capitalist approach that is commonly found in most success stories. Instead it creates all of this psychological and emotional issues with our protagonist and have that be the fuel for success. It never was about gaining the most profits. It was about being cool; It was about fixing the reputation that he made for himself; It was about being better. Facebook was a symbol of a boy's frustration and the filling of a void, through the gain of \"friends\", that was emptied from a collapsed relationship. Sorkin wanted Facebook to be the reason for Zuckerberg's failure in his personal life, and the road towards this self-destruction made the tale all the more interesting. We always assume that this man must be the luckiest and happiest person in the world because he gained so much wealth from it, but we never really considered what he lost from it. Sorkin doesn't give us an ending that might please us, but if we think about it, why would he? The ending of Facebook and Zuckerberg has yet to be written and it's impact is all around us. If there was something in Sorkin's writing that I would praise the most, it's his ability to write great dialogue. It fills the scene with lightning speed and doesn't sacrifice intensity and weight with it. The banter alone at the start of the film is evident enough of how great his writing is, it introduces and defines the character in a matter of minutes, letting the film move along and focus on it's story.\n\nThe film was directed by David Fincher, who I consider to be one of the greatest directors of the 21st century, though some of his best work was found in the last decade before the turn of the century. The Social Network was a big surprise for me, as a few of Fincher's films have addressed the current state of society and the subject of this film would have been a great example in exploring that concept again. Instead he takes a left turn, stripping all of that and creating something small and private. Fincher has been known to make films with a dark atmosphere, aside from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. I think he likes to explore the dark and untouched layers of humans, because maybe it leads to a much more tense and interesting story, or maybe he just wants to be unique, or maybe he resents the false illusion of happiness in people's lives. On my previous review, I accused this film of being light and more happy, but the more I watched it, the more I started to peel and find the layers in the film's characters and saw something that was more darker and sorrowful than what was projected. Fincher has taken a product that is generally known for bringing people closer together, and viewing it as a source of a person's self destruction. This is the reason why I love Fincher's work because he always creates something that we don't really expect, leaving us shocked and surprised until the credits roll. Though the film has it's dark moments, Fincher doesn't forget the essence of Facebook, youth. The film feels youthful, it's slick and cool, and moves at an intensely fast pace. Fincher gives this film so much energy that it makes Sorkin's script come alive, and it also makes for an entertaining film. The film was able to give off this aura of intellect but it never goes to a point of condescension or pretension, allowing the film to retain this accessibility, which has made me come back to it time and time again.\n\nJeff Cronenweth has done three films with David Fincher; Fight Club, The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. I felt this was his most safest compared to the three. It's very focused on capturing the drama rather than being something different and off the wall. The title sequence, where Zuckerberg runs through the campus of Harvard and the final shot that slowly zooms in on Zuckerberg's face, was shot beautifully. His sad facial expression as the last statement is placed on screen before the credits, \"Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in the world\", and along with the intimate and slow zooming photography just expresses the burden that his own creation has caused. Cronenweth, especially in the legal side of things, create this golden aura. Does that symbolise the fight for greed with these characters? Does the room radiate success, I am not quite sure, but maybe as I watch the film more, it would start to become more clear to me. The film may not reach the darkness that is found on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo or Fight Club, but it is still present here in correlation with the pessimistic depth this film contains. Cronenweth's work on this one is not something that I would remember as much but it does apply appropriately to the drama.\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross' work on this film is definitely a plus for me. There was a composition that plays after Zuckerberg's break up with Albright (Rooney Mara) that combines razor violins that haunts the track with a piano that is feels so simple and delicate. It not only sets the film up to a sad start but it also enhances certain moments in the film that make the drama even more dramatic, particularly the scene where Garfield walks up to Zuckerberg and smashes his computer and having an argument. That particular scene is the final cut in their relationship that destroyed their friendship, the ultimate betrayal. That particular composition is used in scenes where Zuckerberg has lost someone important in his life. It is heartbreaking to listen to.\n\nBoth Garfield and Eisenberg gave their most emotionally driven performances I have ever seen. I don't know if it's accurate or not but it doesn't matter as long as their performance drives the story forward and that they are believable in their roles. I felt that Garfield should have been nominated for a supporting actor at the Academy Award as his performance dominates everyone else in this film. Justin Timberlake in this film plays Sean Parker efficiently, he knows how to convincingly act like a jackass. It was a character though I did not like when on screen as I felt he was written to unlikable but I guess that was the point. Rooney Mara's character is a crucial piece but she was a little underused in this film, all is well though cause she has a leading role in Fincher's next film. This film definitely proved that both Garfield and Eisenberg has acting chops and are Oscar worthy.\n\nIt is too soon to say whether or not this film's significance and power will continue to radiate in the years to come. But I wouldn't be surprised if this film would be end up becoming a classic in the near future.",

I have no idea what any of equations or algorithms mean, or how to write script. Maybe I'm a little jealous because I never got to go to college parties as glamorous as the ones in this film? Or maybe the problem is that the subject matter it just so banal that despite the quality of the production, this film is lost on me? I have a problem with this film that is so full of maybes. And yet for all its weaknesses, it won three Oscars, albeit one of them was for Baxter and Wall's editing, which is superb. Both editors have worked on numerous Fincher productions. \n\nNone of the actors are convincing at portraying the real people they are supposed represent. Maybe that's the point? They are attempting to play versions of Zuckerberg and Co. that seem more interesting than the real, live versions. I guess I see the reasoning behind this. As activities, creating companies, programming computers, or writing software, no matter how profound, aren't exactly as riveting as invading Bin Laden's compound, or smuggling blood diamonds out of Liberia. Still, I am no fan of Jesse Eisenberg. His success is baffling to me. He was for a while a Michael Cera impersonation gone wrong, now, whatever he is, he does it well. He sells tons of tickets... but none of them are to me. The best part about this film is that it has Rooney Mara, briefly. Later she becomes Lisbeth in Dragon Tattoo.\n\nThe most interesting thing about this film is simply that it exists and was so successful. Rather, that a production company actually paid David Fincher to try and create a full-on thriller packed with betraying, greedy, snarky little boys either getting their way, or losing millions of dollars. Poor babies. Even if in the end Zuckerberg did create something monumental, so what. It's just a monument to a monument. What does any of this represent? How does any of this change the world? It's not like Facebook has cured any sick people or stopped any wars. It's arguably even created a recent few (of both).\n\nGetthebonesaw.blogspot.com",

However, this movie is based off the book \"The Accidental Billionaires\" by Ben Mezrich, who apparently wrote the supposed-biography from the point of view of the people who seem to have good reason to dislike Zuckerberg as they are some of the people that floundered when Zuckerberg flourished. I'm not sure how much is actually believable, but I do like the roundness of the story. At the beginning when Zuckerberg is dumped, his ex-girlfriend tells him that girls will dislike him because he is an asshole. At the end of the story, one of the lawyers tells him that he isn't an asshole, he is only trying to be one. It's an interesting thought to process, as during the movie we are wondering if he really is the jerk he plays, or if he is just playing a jerk because that is the thing to do? While this isn't a favorite movie of mine, and isn't one I would typically make time to watch(was for a school assignment), it was decently good and an interesting take on one of the most popular things to hit the world.",

            "content": "\"You know, you really don't need a forensics team to get to the bottom of this. If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook.\"\n\nWhen I first heard that a film was being made about the creation of Facebook, I was extremely skeptical of how it would turn out. I'm not a Facebook user, so the idea of a movie about it and its creator Mark Zuckerberg wouldn't appeal to me, and biopics don't really have a strong reputation in the film industry, particularly when it comes to telling the truth. With the film gaining a massive popularity, with its Oscar buzz and its inspiration to many young entrepreneurs, while I was still skeptical of what I would think of the film, it made my skepticism of the film a little lighter. After finally getting my experience of this massively acclaimed film, my initial thoughts of the film actually happened; while I do not understand the power of Facebook nor rave massive praise like almost every single critic in the country, I do admit that The Social Network is still decently made, and is still worth anyone's time.\n\nIn 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer genius Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) came up with the idea of a social-media site that could change society forever. After a few tweaks, Zuckerberg's \"Facebook\" site becomes one of the most successful websites of all-time, but Zuckerberg's newfound fame comes at a price. His personal life becomes a pain to deal with as he faces legal battles over another, mostly coming from former associates that are determined to make him fail.\n\nWhy do I believe The Social Network is overrated? Well, like most so-called biopics, the filmmakers would rather change the actual events of the story in favor of adding more \"entertainment\" to it, which explains why there's scenes of extreme drinking and partying that Zuckerberg claimed did not happen in real life. If Zuckerberg claimed these scenes did not happen in real life, then it truly is an insult to see something that did not happen be placed in a movie meant to tell the \"true story.\" People, this is why I've bashed other biopics in the past, such as The Blind Side! It's a disgrace to the real story, and it questions the future of Hollywood filmmaking. But while The Blind Side suffered terribly due to its extremely inaccurate portrayal and racist stereotypes, The Social Network had better things to be recognized on, but it's still not a masterpiece.\n\nAnother problem that is suffered greatly in the film is the rather uneven direction from David Fincher, the so-called acclaimed filmmaker who made this movie. I haven't seen any of his other films, so I can't judge him when it comes to how great of a director he supposedly is, but his direction here is all over the place. The pacing is uneven and what messes up the flow is the fact that the whole story is told in flashback, with the story told in time of the legal battle. It really messes up moments in the film that could have been shocking, but because of it, it ends up becoming rather predictable. Take a look at the Eduardo character for example. The film starts out showing why he hates Zuckerberg so much and how he betrayed him in ownership of Facebook, then we go back in time to see them as buddies before the ultimate betrayal. This format of filmmaking has worked well in the past, working brilliantly in films like Titanic and Sunset Boulevard, but it doesn't hear.\n\nBut what makes up for the direction is its witty screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. Despite the inaccuracies of the film, I have to admit the script is pure genius. It's probably the biggest reason why many critics adored this film, cause it's just a modern work of art. The opening scene with Zuckerberg's love issue was executed brilliantly, and I was laughing my head off at the love gone bonkers! The sheer brilliance of the screenplay was so good that it raised my final score for the film a little bit than what I was initially going to give it (which would have been a 5).\n\nAlso making the film worth just one viewing is its very strong acting performances. Nominated for an Academy Award for his performance, Jesse Eisenburg nails the nerdy, intriguing persona of Mark Zuckerberg. I wouldn't have rooted for the character due to his selfish motivations, but I was impressed by what Eisenburg did in his acting. With the announcement that he's playing Lex Luther in the upcoming Batman/Superman crossover, I have no doubts that Eisenburg will be a shining light in the next generation of real, talented acting. I was also impressed with Justin Timberlake as the drug-addicting womanizer Napster founder Sean Parker. I'm not sure if the things depicted int he film were true or not, cause the drug abuse goes over-the-top towards the end of the film, Timberlake shows that he can go from pop sensation to actor in a decently entertaining performance. But the single-handed best performance of the whole entire film, and one I would truly give an award to, is Andrew Garfield as co-founder Eduardo Saverin. His final anger rant at the end of the film over his betrayal is worth an Oscar alone! I also wish well for Garfield's career, hopefully with better material when his Spider-Man contract is up.\n\nBut even with all my likings on the film, there's still one thing I need to really complain about, and that's the music score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. IT IS POSSIBLY THE WORST MUSIC SCORE I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE! The heavy use of electronic synthesizers might have worked if the film was called \"Social Network in Outer Space\" or some other ridiculous B-Movie styled title, but in a film about the creator of Facebook it's extremely out of place. What makes me even more mad was that it won an Oscar, beating out the phenomenal scores of both John Powell's for How to Train Your Dragon and Hans Zimmer's for Inception! That I will never understand, even long after the day I die!\n\nWhile The Social Network has a very witty screenplay and there's strong acting performances, especially from Andrew Garfield and Jesse Eisenberg, The Social Network is one of the most overrated Oscar-nominated films of recent memory. David Fincher's direction and storytelling is uneven and predictable, it lacks reasoning to why anyone would want to join Facebook (unless you're already a member, which I still have no interest in joining by the way), and the inaccuracy of the real story is a huge insult to Mark Zuckerberg and everyone involved in the actual creation of Facebook. There are far better biopics out there that strive to be honest, and they are much, much better, like Gandhi, Lincoln, and Captain Phillips. David Fincher is currently in talks in creating a Steve Jobs biopic, one that's supposed to make up for the critically panned Jobs movie with Ashton Kutcher, and all I have to say is, I sure hope he knows what he's doing.\n\n\"Woops. Broke your 350 year old doorknob.\"",

And many people may just accept it flippantly without thinking twice about why it is so good. And there are many reasons why it is. Firstly, it is very clear that the filmmakers have made a very good job of keeping the film extremely close to the truth, at least, it would seem that way. And by making the film while Facebook is such a phenomenon, and Mr. Zuckerberg having so much power,  the film still portrays him in a slightly negative light, which is both a smart and brave move which has given the film the respect it justly deserves.",

            "content": "Making The Social Network was quite the risk. Facebook, while already massive and continuing to grow, is still young. The same could be said for its creators whom are portrayed in the film. It seemed strange to me to tackle the story of Facebook so soon. But shortly after viewing it, I was astounded. This is a beautifully crafted piece of cinema and one of the best films I have seen in my life. The cast is perfect. Jesse Eisenberg captures Mark Zuckerberg's cold genius wonderfully. Justin Timberlake is impressive as Sean Parker and is well on his way to making me forget acting wasn't his first job in show business. Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin is quite possibly the best of them all. His \"freak out\" in the \"One Million Members Party\" scene is simultaneously shocking, heartbreaking, and mildly amusing, making it one of my favorite moments in all the movies I've seen. Of course, the actors are working off of a great script as well. The switching between the creation and the aftermath of Facebook is incredibly effective. My only gripe with The Social Network is the fact that Mark Zuckerberg and his associates (and enemies for that matter) have stated that a fair portion of the film is exaggeration. Part of me wanted the true story, but the rest of me remembers that it probably wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining. Regardless, I do not hesitate in the least when I say anyone who has experienced the rise of social media in any way needs to see this film. It is a movie that matters not only to our society of Facebookers and Tweeters, but also to the entire movie industry.",
