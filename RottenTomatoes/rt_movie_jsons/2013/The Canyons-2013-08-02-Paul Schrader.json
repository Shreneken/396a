Get over it. Its a tale of a chick hanging on and a guy with a trust fund supporting her. They work that out thru online hookups that get filmed. She does people, he does people. It gets filmed. Welcome to Hollywood. Its not great, but its not as terrible as the reviews would have you believe. If u wanna stream it from somewhere, or u find it in a bargain bin - GRAB IT. Its worth a watch",

            "content": "So this was a notorious project because of the presence of the notorious Lindsay Lohan.\n\nThe thing is it is not a horrible movie. It's not a great movie for sure and someone else would have been better in the role LL plays in the movie, type wise, but she's OK if a bit sad and puffy looking, not great for someone in her mid-20s. But maybe on second thought appropriate for the role of a fading Hollywood woman with a very dim future.\n\nIt turned out the most notorious person in the movie is the male lead, James Deen. He came from porn where he performs bisexually, I have not seen any of these movies. He is one of the few contemporary male porn performers with name recognition. The gossip goes that he was brought into the project via Bret Easton Ellis who wanted him.\nHe is a little weak but good enough in the role even though there was no reason that a porn actor had to do this, there is not that much sex on screen in the movie. He does bring a definite smarminess to the role. I kept seeing him in Overexposed: The Anthony Weiner Story.\nAnyway, he plays a bratty LA mega trust fund guy who produces movies. Lohan plays his girlfriend who is basically doing what Charlie wants which is mostly be involved with hook-ups with other people which he likes to record on his phone. They have an encounter in which she gets him to do something with another man and around the same time he thinks that she is seeing someone else who he doesn't know about. All this causes a blow out of his need to control her resulting in nasty wayward brutal emotions.\n\nThe question is: Is James Deen basically playing himself and are the nasty scenes in the film, brutality to women, reflective of his actual life? (He has since been accused of brutality toward women by a couple of victims.) \nAnd: Did Ellis know this and for that reason put him in the movie?\n\nPaul Schrader has had a really brilliant career. I hope he gets to make another movie after this.\n\nThe themes in the movie, well worth looking into, are more successfully explored in an older movie Star 80 by Bob Fosse. An excellent move.",

            "content": "There's something perversely mesmerizing about the cinematic train wreck that is The Canyons, the latest from director Paul Schrader. Maybe it's the director's confidence. This pulpy, sex-fueled story is utter nonsense, but it's entertaining nonsense. The performances from porn star James Deen and tabloid queen Lindsay Lohan are abysmal, but they're also oddly appropriate. Provocateur Bret Easton Ellis' dialogue is ham-fisted and silly, but he also laces the film with a dry sense of humor that makes it go down rather easily. Make no mistake: this isn't a particularly good movie by any definition of the word. But \"so bad it's good\" seems like an assessment tailor-made for The Canyons.\n\nSet in Los Angeles, The Canyons follows Christian (Deen), a trust-fund kid who makes movies to keep his overbearing father off his back. He's romantically involved with Tara (Lohan), but their sex life involves finding adult friends on the internet and taping each other getting involved with them. Tara, however, harbors a secret from her man. She's in love with Ryan (Nolan Funk), the boyfriend of Christian's assistant Gina (Amanda Brooks) and the star of Christian's latest production, which Tara has gotten heavily involved in. Tara and Ryan lived together years ago, and she left the struggling actor for a more financially secure life with Christian. But upon reuniting, the two learned such intense feelings don't die easily.\n\nThough Christian has no problems watching Tara with another man, the thought of her being emotionally involved with someone other than him starts consuming him. He becomes paranoid and increasingly difficult to be around. Even his long-time lay Cynthia (Tenille Houston) asks him to stop coming around. It's Ryan, though, who bears the brunt of Christian's madness, and soon, the two are locked in a battle of wills so intense that lives truly are on the line.\n\nIt's hard to even know where to begin with a film like this. It oscillates so wildly and from minute to minute between awesome and awful that, 90 minutes later, you'll just feel exhausted. The film's most interesting commentary relates to Schrader's apparent insistence that cinema is dead. The Canyons' opening credits are played over moving still images of abandoned movie houses. Christian waxes not-so-poetic about his non-plussed attitude toward his job. Over lunch, Tara asks Gina when her last meaningful moviegoing experience was. (She blanks.) Christian uses his iPhone-not a camera-to film Tara's sex scenes.\n\nThen there's the who meta idea of The Canyons being a deliberately trite cinematic sex-capade starring a porn star and a Lohan that's a day-and-date VOD release. It's unfortunate that no discussion of The Canyons can be had without acknowledging its roots. (I'll stay away from its troubled production history...that's neither here nor there.) But that's the nature of the beast Schrader has created.\n\nWhether you're of the belief that The Canyons is hollow trash (it is) or a smart, deliberate commentary (still hollow), it seems impossible to me that someone would defend the lifeless corpses known as James Deen and Lindsay Lohan who, apparently, were supposed to be the lead actor and actress of this film. It should be noted, however, that the film's biggest offenders are Easton Ellis and his banal dialogue, but it's delivered painfully by every actor involved (even an unsuspecting Gus van Sant...seriously...)\n\nSchrader's Los Angeles is an interesting place that could have been (and has been previously) explored thoughtfully, but here, he seemed more interested in making an awful movie and seeing if he could get away with it. It's cool that he wants to call his choices deliberate, but I'm calling bullshit. Yes, The Canyons is kind of fun in a truly twisted way, but at the end of the day, I need something to latch onto, and nobody involved has anything to offer.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/the-canyons-review/",

Because \"The Canyons\" is just a weak copycat of that detached loveless and angst-filled selfcentered zombielike L.A. sphere Ellis has been roaming around in since his debut. A constant theme in Ellis' work is the existential \"ennui\", the boredom and emptiness of life, the absence of deeper meaning. The missing connection within and with others and genuine emotions. A world that I liked and found intriguing back in the 80s, but in 2015 it´s maybe not so intriguing anymore. The pillars of shallowness, lies, intrigues, wobbly psyches and eventually murder is not handled in a strong way neither storywise nor directionwise. Then again having the train wreck Lindsay Lohan as the poster name is hardly a guarantee that you will get some sort of great and dynamic performance and adding a porn star as her counterpart is maybe not a good decision either. The once freckled faced and cute Lindsay Lohan is gone and a way too worn and undressed version has emerged despite her still young age. Too many wrong paths has been taken for her and she is on the road to become bound to do B-horror movies futurewise unless she truly change her ways and find peace with herself and what she wants to be and do. It can be done. There´s hope. The actress Leslie Camila-Rose was actually on call throughout the entire filming to replace Lindsay Lohan at a moment's notice due to Lohan's repeated absences, tardiness, and feuds with director Paul Schrader and co-star James Deen. Coutterrand was essentially paid to be Lohan's understudy in case Lohan was fired or left the set and never returned. However, I did like Tenille Houston as Cynthia. The acting in \"The Canyons\" is hardly convincing and there´s no suspense what so ever in the film. The direction is average at best and I reckon Schrader´s attempt to make the movie a suspenseful thriller á la Brian De Palma in his heydays fails pretty big. Linda Barnard of the Toronto Star gave the film one out of four stars, calling it \"a howlingly bad soap-opera-meets-soft-core-porn mash-up\". \"The Canyons\" is not Ellis, Lohan´s nor Schrader´s finest hour and this will only end up as footnote in movie history.",

Like when she starts crying, it feels too dramatic since her opposing actor isn't a believable threat. It's like why is she crying so much. You can tell that the director & cinematographer did everything in their power to make sure they wouldn't take any of the blame for this flopping. It looked good, I liked how they tried to make it feel like real life.  The shots were well composited and pleasing to the eye. I think it might have been the writer, the casting, and possibly producers who failed. Although, it is the director's job to pull the talent out of the actor. Either these were really untalented actors or the director didn't put enough effort to make the best of their performances. Now about the writing, really?  I mean everything you could do wrong they practically did. There was absolutely no character development or back story. There is a saying in Hollywood, if Timmy fell down the well would you care?  In this movie I couldn't care. Why was Tara (Lohan) crying so much? Why would she put up with a d-bag of a boyfriend to live a wealthy lifestyle? I mean we all want that life but what was her motivation? What was the source of Christian's (Deen) behavior? We know it had something to do with the father but what did he go through? Why was Tara so desirable that Christian stalked his own girlfriend and Ryan was obsessed with his ex-girlfriend? What was so special about Tara and why do I care? The writer failed to use a vehicle to tell a back story or give the characters depth. The timeline was so linear we failed to see the outer forces that lead these characters down their paths. They could have used flashbacks instead of casually mentioning events in the dialogue. If they really wanted to avoid flashbacks and keep that timeline strictly linear then they should've showed more interaction with characters other than the main ones.  We should've met Christian's father. We should've seen Ryan's failed & drastic attempts to further his career. We should've met someone other than Ryan from Tara's past. We needed to see their self torments and motivation for such deep desire to achieve their dreams or motivated their dark sides. Everybody wants to live a wealthy lifestyle, archive fame, to have true love, to control every aspect of their lives, to enact revenge, to simply have everything they want to be happy & admired. Why did I care about these characters trying to achieve what everyone wants. What I would have cared about is why they would go to such drastic lengths to do so. I wanted to relate to their character and feel empathy or even sympathy. The ending was weak, left me with no closure or understanding of Ryan's continuing obsession with Tara. \n\nTHE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS THAT FOURSOME SEX SCENE!!  Seeing James Deen performing bisexual acts against his will was worth watching the whole movie.",

Maybe it's because there are a few brief scenes involving male nudity and homoeroticism. I don't know, but this is a really interesting movie involving a number of smart and talented people, and it has some interesting things to say about the state of the film industry and how movies get made. Lindsay Lohan gives a genuinely tense, brave, non-airbrushed performance, James Deen gets the sexually dominant guy with Big Issues right and the cinematography constantly evokes an aura of The Death of Hollywood. There's some stilted acting from a couple of the lesser known actors and I thought James Deen's character going American Psycho was overkill on Ellis's part (a more downplayed climax would have fit the film better imo) but this is a much better, much more interesting film than most of its critical reviews reflect.",

Deen and Lohan have interesting chemistry, but they don't share enough screen time to get the full effect. Deen is a surprisingly half decent actor. Considering his day job is porn, that's a compliment. He pulls off the \"rich kid douche bag\" role fairly well. In a few glimpses, Lohan shows she still has acting chops, but you can tell she is struggling internally with something that has nothing to do with the script. Her makeup is a mess, her face looks bloated and tired, her voice is ragged and sounds like it will die out at any moment, she looks a good five years older than me when, in fact, I am two years older than her. In short, I feel sorry for her. The nude scenes reek of desperation; something to try and save a film that clearly lacks any substance or direction. And while Lohan has a great rack, there was really no need to show anything as sex wasn't even the central plot. It was barely a plot at all. The film only started to get interesting right before the credits ran. The slight twist at the end was cool, I admit. Just as it looks like there could be hope for it to be good- BAM. It's over. They would have been better off making this a softcore porno. Would have been way more interesting to watch. Instead you get an hour of the camera following actors around in real time (this is supposed to be artsy and interesting, I guess.

Her career was so promising. She became a famous teen star after the success of \"Freaky Friday\" and \"Mean Girls\". After appearing in independent releases like \"A Prairie Home Companion\" and \"Bobby\", she later became famous for being a tabloid train wreck. 2013 has been especially hard for Lohan. First she appeared in a cameo role in the R-Rated sketch comedy \"InAPPropriate Comedy\" (which I didn't see), she became the latest goddess to sleep with Charlie Sheen in \"Scary Movie 5\" and now she appears in \"The Canyons\", a depressing erotic thriller that is neither sexy or thrilling.\n\nLohan plays Tara, a wannabe actress who gave up her life to be an actress years ago, so she decided to live with her wealthy boyfriend, a young movie producer named Christian (porn star James Deen). Christian suspects Tara of having an affair with her ex-boyfriend Ryan (Nolan Funk), a struggling actor who lives from paycheck-to-paycheck. When Tara can't stay in Ryan's lifestyle, she decides to stay with Christian, they have sex with multiple partners and play twisty games with each other.\n\nAs you can see the plot description I told you about, \"The Canyons\" is a stupid, artless mess. Everybody in this movie is either sexually obsessive, depressed or unlikeable. \n\"The Canyons\" also looks like a soft-core porn film that might've got a theatrical release by mistake. What's surprising is that \"Good Will Hunting\" director Gus Van Sant has a small supporting role in the film as a shrink named Dr. Campbell. What's even more surprising about \"The Canyons\" is that it was written by Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho) and directed by Paul Schrader (American Gigolo and Affliction). Schrader was once one of the greatest screenwriters ever, he wrote \"Taxi Driver\", \"Raging Bull\", \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" and \"Bringing Out The Dead\" for director Martin Scorsese. Schrader was even a good director he directed \"American Gigolo\" starring Richard Gere and \"Affliction\" starring Nick Nolte and James Coburn. \n\nThe late great actor George C. Scott once said to Schrader: \"You're a great screenwriter but the world's worst goddamned director.\" I wouldn't have said that to Schrader, he's still a screenwriting master. Sure, Schrader makes dark, moody movies about isolated, depressing people, \"The Canyons\" is also dark, moody movie with depressing characters but it has no style and no substance. Bret Easton Ellis is also masterful writer, He writes stories about hateful individuals working in a upper class society but his screenplay for \"The Canyons\" has no tone at all. The plot and the dialogue are way too ridiculous. \n\nLet's talk about the casting of porn star James Deen. Who thought casting this guy was a good idea? Did anybody think that this guy had talent? Why does he look like a weird mix of Anthony Weiner and Paul Ryan? Porn stars should not act at all. Yes, I'm willing to admit this, Paul Ryan might have been the better choice to play the abusive L.A. movie producer. \n\nThe New York Times article about the making of \"The Canyons\" might have been the better movie to make for Paul Schrader and Bret Easton Ellis but what we have here is an inept soap opera. Lindsay Lohan if you want your career to be back on track, don't ask Charlie Sheen or your crazy parents to help you, just get actual help.",

The Canyons is not a good movie but it most definitely isn't as bad as the scathing reviews it has gotten either as most of its cheekiness is intentional and is supposed to be both lurid and sleazy while filled with the melodramatic cheap thrills the film provides.  I believe it is supposed to be a \"guilty pleasure\" type of movie as parts of it are \"so bad it is good\".  Lohan plays an actress who is the unlucky girlfriend of sexually-obsessed and eternally suspicious movie producer Christian (Deen) who makes movies to ensure his trust fund stays intact.  She is asked to do his bidding and please him in many ways ... most often in the nude and quite often playing around with someone else of his choosing (and Lohan does get nude).  When she encounters a person from her past who is trying to win a part in Christian's latest film that she once had feelings for, she is put in an even more difficult and delicate situation as she is once again drawn to this past love but she is afraid of Christian's wild rages and uncontrollable jealousy.  Oh yes ... that is the film and one can only imagine how over-the-top and ridiculous much of the dialogue and situations become.  Lohan makes one laugh a time or two with her delivery but she is also quite good in a few key dramatic scenes making me assume she grasps exactly what this film is.  She makes the film somewhat tragic ... which it actually is for a number of reasons.",

When it turns out that Tara has a history with the lead of his film project his paranoia takes over and we see his mind games spiral out of control with terrible consequences for all.\n\nThis film has already become so famous for being bad it seems a tad redundant to even be writing about it. To be honest I was curious if a film could be as bad as this was being made out to be. This is afterall the film that was turned away from the likes of Sundance and SXSW for being too ugly, a film directed by Paul Schrader and written by Brett Easton Ellis that cannot even get a distribution deal beyond the one cinema it screened in in New York last month. When even something called Sharknado can get an outing on the basis that it's so-bad-it's-good, where has this one failed?\n\nThe film is not terribly made, it's not like Schrader has suddenly forgotten how to put a reel together. In the case of our two leads, the acting is not bad; James Deen makes a surprisingly decent screen presence whilst Lohan manages to remind us that there is (was?) talent there. If you haven't already I urge you to see A Prairie Home Companion, it's a Robert Altman film and despite featuring the likes of Tommy Lee Jones and John C. Reilly, Lohan is the best thing in it. Along with Mean Girls it stands as a testament to how badly the wheels can come off the rails and how far people are willing to let them fly in the name of entertainment. As for the rest of the cast, perhaps budget considerations where the reason most of them made it to the first read through.\n\nIt is terribly written, it makes itself out to be some piece of trashy fun. Like a feature length episode of an MTV reality show but with added breasts. Yet, every time it threatens to get in the slightest bit entertaining in this manner, the film ducks, it bobs and it weaves its way back to an anti-climax. Instead of relishing with guilty delight over how these empty, ugly, superficial characters ruin their own lives, it appears Easton Ellis wanted us to sympathise. With what exactly is still very much unclear. There also appears to be some sort of half hearted attempt at making it a psychological thriller but the script is simply too shallow, the actions and emotions on screen are without motive or justification.\n\nAs a z-list piece of fun this might have worked, however it has aspirations to be a film it simply never was and as a result just comes across as flat and lazy filmmaking. One gets the feeling, especially reading about the fallout from the film that Schrader may be done as a director, this is sad but not necessarily a bad thing, he was always a better writer anyway. Hopefully, Easton Ellis will go back to twitter and realise that no-one is as good as he thinks he is and hopefully Lohan will get herself together and exploit the talent she clearly has.",

            "content": "It's hard to talk about The Canyons without talking about the making of The Canyons. From profiles in The New York Times to think pieces in Film Comment to essays by the filmmakers on their give-and-take with star Lindsay Lohan, they have all magnified the scenes behind the scenes, cultivating an expectation of a nasty piece of work. It is that. But not in the way you were hoping for.\n\nSo before you click download on this sometimes-erotic thriller, know this: you're not about to watch Obsessed. The Canyons is a movie about empty people with empty lives finding a thrill in their nihilistic attempts to feel.\n\nDon't be dismayed by the many critics who were ready to clamp down on The Canyons as soon as they possibly could: it's not as bad as they're saying. It's a low-budget film that looks like it was filmed on a low budget, but in most respects that's its biggest crime. Press-stopping names were hired to make up for the lack of financial backing, and that resulted in Lohan and her renown porn co-star James Deen taking the lead roles. What they do with it comes down to their different schools of performing. Deen, most studious in the money shot, does everything shy of winking at you. At times, it works, especially when Deen needs to be a more playful, sneakingly sinister Christian. At others, it doesn't. There are points when The Canyons could have served itself better by choosing not to show us anything at all.\n\nBut it's Lohan who gives a great performance - and I'm being 100 percent un-ironic when I say that. Perhaps the other roles were filled in with lackluster actors allowing her to gleam in the spotlight, but not only is Lohan the star of The Canyons, she's the most believable part of it. Lohan reins it in and delivers when the script calls for it. It's a shame, then, that the screenplay didn't give her more to do.\n\nSure - you've seen the trailer, and you've read the articles - Lohan strips down and hams it up in raunchy sex scenes, but her role as Tara is given the least story.\n\nThe Canyons is about an ex-aspiring actress Tara (Lohan) and her producer boyfriend Christian (Deen) who work on B-grade slasher flicks. Christian has just hired an actor, Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk), by Tara's request and as a favor to his assistant (Ryan's girlfriend) who is spearheading the film. There's just one sordid detail: Tara and Ryan have a history. They have a present, too. And Christian grows more and more suspicious and paranoid with each passing moment. Soon, the trio indirectly involve themselves in a play of sexual prowess and desire, pushing the limits of how far they'd degrade themselves to rise to power in the hollow city of Los Angeles. But most of it goes to Christian and Ryan, having Tara pop up to react to most of the situations whenever convenient.\n\nlohan and deen the canyons\n\nIt appears that The Canyons has many things to say: it wants to converse about the conveyor belt filmmaking that has become the norm in Hollywood, it wants to comment on the lack of creativity in the market, it wants to warn the masses of micro-budget films accessible to anyone with a camera-phone, to show you the lack of intellectual connections of this generation, and it surely wants to let you peek into the lives of sexy people who offer not much more than that to the world. Exposing the shallowness of L.A.'s elite and elite-hopefuls is always a fine line to ride, and unfortunately a lot of The Canyons comes up short.\n\nSee, The Canyons touches upon all these subjects, but it never really does more than that. It shows these people to you and then never makes any judgements. It displays them for all to see and then just quietly fades to black. Perhaps that was the intention, mirroring the soulless in a film that's equally as shallow, but perhaps not - the film does open up with images of abandoned theaters, and runs those images throughout, for that matter.\n\nAnd it feels that way - cold. It's dead, airy. The first few minutes are dedicated to four characters just talking at a restaurant, everyone staring into the camera, talking to each other but to no one, really. It's about all of us actually being actors, pretending to feel how we need to in certain situations. Every once in a while a character will look directly at you: \"This is fake. We're pretending,\" The Canyons is saying. None of this is real, for as much as The Canyons wants to feel distant and isolated, it also wants you to have front-row access to these characters and all of their depravity, at times forcing you to stroll along with them in long, tracking movements. And, yes, low-budget filmmaking means The Canyons has to heavily rely on people talking at each other about information (I love you! We were broke! Exposition ad nauseam!).\n\nBut something happened halfway into The Canyons where I stopped thinking that and I became invested.\n\nThe crux of low-budget filmmaking is, of course, the lack of resources - then, the lack of talent, the lack of multiple setups, and the lack of time. But most importantly, unwillingness to dig deeper into the issues of vapidity. If not for that, if even some supporting players were up to task, The Canyons could have soared to Bling Ring and Spring Breakers heights.",

It is unfortunate that the naysaying around this movie hit such a fever pitch before masses got a chance to see it objectively, because their viewings of it have been colored by the negative press and a desire to see this movie in a negative light; alternatively, there are a lot of people who went into this not knowing what to expect from it I think. This *feels* lake an Easton Ellis novel on screen--I see a lot of the character types he explores in books like Less Than Zero and Imperial Bedrooms blended together here, within the context of an erotic thriller, at last delivering a film that I think truly contains within itself the spirit of Ellis' writing--something most adaptations of his work to film thus far have failed to do. In closing, Lindsay Lohan's Tara is exceptionally performed and nuanced, and I can't imagine another actress having played her. The dialogue between characters is very real and intimate, natural and organic, to such a degree that it was positively sublime. A+",

I went to see the great talent Paul Schrader--who wrote \"Taxi Driver\" and directed Richard Gere (\"American Gigolo\") and Nick Nolte (\"Affliction\") to some of their finest performances.  Add in Bret Easton Ellis -- who I know can bang out a great book (\"American Psycho\", \"Less Than Zero') -- I had hope for Lohan's tanking career. Boy, I was wrong. Horrible acting, the worst by porno actor James Deen. I have no problem appropriating non-professional actors in films, but Schrader was unable to get Deen to stop do the porno acting staples: \"blue steel\" for sexual intensity and smirking for the more light-hearted scenes.  Poor LiLo --- she's a very good actor, but this claptrap never should have made it to the screen.

The acting by the supporting cast comes off as line readings by amateurs, but (surprise to say this), Lindsay Lohan and porn-star James Deen are terrific in this twisty, who-done it and who will-do it.  They are bored swingers in the movie business; enter a fresh, young couple working on the film who discover associating with them lead them down a dirty path.  Deen is particularly effective here as a spoiled rich boy producing the film.  He wants ownership of things and even treat women as possessions to hold.  When things do not go his way, he reacts.  Written by Brent Easton Ellis of American Psycho fame, the comparisons are easy to see. But Deen is really good.  Maybe I didn't have high expectations for either lead considering their pop culture status, but the cruel mind games kept me interested.  Several explicit sex scenes add to the enjoyment - including one that goes way off the deep end.  The scenes of decaying movie theaters was an interesting tip to the hat on how the film business is just like Deen's character - obsessed with money & little substance.  Director Paul Schrader likes rough & tumble characters and here he creates 2 I will not likely forget.  *** out of 4-stars",

And if he hates it, I still love it.  We see Deen's character arc from bad to worse. And Lindsay's from scared to petrified. We see a world of people who live for money.  There is back stabbing, cruelty, cheating, and perversion. Yet there is love and romance amidst it all. But in the end the bad stuff extinguishes the good. This is true Hollywood with a true real Hollywood end. It's not the fairy tale people want to be lulled into complacency by.\n\nAnd the music is great. Son of Perdition (featuring Rob James) sounds like a 60s Lee Hazelwood. The rest of Brendan Canning & me&john's soundtrack is great and hits that undercurrent of decayed Hollywood theaters, and decayed Hollywood people; topped of with classic Dum Dum Girls' Coming Down.\n\nYes, there are technical flaws, maybe. Or maybe it's just a casual style. There's stuff that an experienced contemporary filmmaker would look at and say, it's terrible, it's amateur. But is it really flawed or is it just that the viewer is so accustomed to homogenized perfect Barbie world tripe?  And that's part of the nostalgia. 60's films were like that; grungy, less than perfect. People didn't care. They just wanted to see the film, or maybe take their sex-mate to a drive in and get it on . And when was the last time a major Hollywood film was actually X rated? Today's world is so conservatively annal retentive about being political, fashionably, and financially perfect.\n\nJames Deen and Lindsay Lohan\nWhen I watch this movie I look past all that perfection crap and I look at the meat of the matter, and I'm not talking about James Deen's wad or Lindsay's naked breasts. I'm talking about the story and the quality of the basic cinematic story aspects. Get past where you think the lighting isn't right, or there's something distracting in the background. That kind of critical thinking is based on what you expect a  movie to be. It's a perception,  based on media hype about what a film should look like. But that definition of is only technical excellence. You may like the Hangover series. They are technically perfect. I think they suck ass. The Canyons is an unusual film about the decay of Hollywood. Not just the physical decay of abandoned movie theaters.  But the decay of the people who make films who stoop to personal fulfillment over some kind of selfless contribution to film (In case you're from Hollywood, selfless means you don't care about your self, over some kind of greater good).\n\nI think the plethora of critics coming out in droves with hate and disdain for this movie, actually fear what they see in the mirror. Do any of them find anything good to say? Obviously none of them were brought up to stay silent unless you have something nice to say to people (neither was I). And that's why this movie is their mirror. If you believe something is bad and you tell others it's bad, then it's perceived as bad.",

James Deen probably gives the best performance as Lohan's controlling psychotic boyfriend which is ironic considering a perusal of Deen's acting credits on imdb reveal such titles as MILFs Seeking Boys III, No Swallowing Allowed 4, and Anal Expedition 9. Presumably this is why he was so comfortable displaying his junk. \n\nDirector Paul Schrader doesn't seem to be getting anything from his actors. Lohan seems confused most of the time. In some scenes she literally looks like she's forgotten her lines and just improvises on the spot while shaking her head and closing her eyes. The rest of the cast could just as easily be starring in an episode of The Hills on crack. I did keep thinking of The Informers which was also an adaptation of an Easton Ellis novel although this was probably due more to the Beverly Hills setting than any real resemblance to that movie, which puts this to shame. \n\nThere isn't really much more I can say about The Canyons. People go for dinner. People drive around. People have sex. People call each other on the phone. People try and screw each other over; your typical Hollywood Z-listers story or more aptly, an overlong R-Rated episode of The Hills.

The\n other men likewise required to bare flesh fared only slightly better; one was marred by an over-styled Donald Trump-type hairdo but had great cheekbones and a nice bod. The gay characters in the movie were presented as beady-eyed and desperate for young flesh. Yes, it was that kind of a movie, a sort of pulp novel trash-fest if you like that kind of thing. I suspect many will find these \"canyons\" abysmal rather than alluring.",

If this film is trying to make a point that cinema is dying a slow, painful death, it sure lives up to that premise. 'When's the last time you saw a movie you really thought meant something to you?' asks Lindsay Lohan's Tara, an aspiring actress who's stopped aspiring. She lives in lavish luxury by Christian (porn star James Deen, who can actually act), a producer with a wicked jealous streak, which isn't good for Tara's affair with an ex-boyfriend (Nolan Funk). Christian also keeps her busy by bringing home various individuals for sex. The plot reads like a poor man's Bret Easton Ellis, and made all the more tragic by the fact that Ellis wrote the script. That the director is the great Paul Schrader (American Gigolo, The Comfort of Strangers, Affliction) is the final nail in the coffin. Lohan, who hasn't starred in a decent movie in almost a decade, and this is no different, still has small moments that shows she can still act, but she's pretty much alone on a sinking ship. The film is dead on arrival. Pity.",

Sunday evening I was looking for something to watch, came across it and figured I'd give it a chance.  It stars Lindsay Lohan as a yoga instructor who has a volatile/crazy sexual relationship with a producer played by James Deen.  He becomes obsessed when he thinks she is cheating on him and things escalate from there.  It's a thriller, that offers no thrills, well except to see Lohan naked through a lot of the movie.  This is basically a notch above softcore porn's you see late night on Cinemax.  Lot of nudity, some sex, and a whole lot of bad acting.  It does have one of the weirdest sex scenes I've ever seen in a movie, as a foursome.  Lohan probably is the best thing about the movie here. but even she does horrible.  Deen has 2 facial expressions, bored and a smirkish pout.  Plus, the way the movie ends is pretty stupid.  They probably could have done some cooler stuff with the way Deen's character goes crazier and crazier, but they don't.  It's an hour and a half that drags a lot, just feels too slow.   I give it 2 stars for Lohan's two best assets, but other than that this is a complete skip.  If EW gives this a B+ I'd really hate to see what their version of an A is.",

What happened to you, Mr. Schrader?  Your ass used to be beautiful, so to speak (let's look at some great-to-good films he's directed, nevermind wrote: Blue Collar, Hardcore, American Gigolo, Cat People, fucking MISHIMA, Affliction, even Auto Focus!)  And Ellis has, um, two excellent books, and I don't have any desire to read the rest.  Lord do I not now more than ever!  \n\nIt's written and directed like a sub-par Lifetime movie (this confirmed by my wife who suffered through the movie with me and has seen more than her share), and features acting that is some of the worst, most ineffectual, bland, soulless I've seen in a movie not made by film school students.  Shit, at least THE BROTHERS OF MYSTICAL (for my fellow WPU alumn) could be somewhat forgiven by being made by amateurs.  Schrader, Ellis and whoever that DP who loves to make things look all shiny and glossy like it's an episode of the fucking Hills don't have that excuse!  I mean, James Deen.  Good God.  I never thought I would wish Tommy Wiseau appeared to make a film's quality upgraded!\n\nLindsay Lohan... was actually pretty good.  Or, let me amend that - she was good inasmuch that EVEYRONE ELSE was not good so her performance was elevated to be by FAR the best in the film, when she was just doing the best with the turgid dialog she had, though one actress has a halfway decent scene that I can't remember.  It helps that Lohan is basically playing some weird meta version of herself, I think, but she at least is trying, she at least takes the words from the page and tries.  The other actors... I still can't get over Deen.  Why did Paul Schrader think it was a good idea to let this GAY PORN ACTOR onto a professional film set?  \n\nA movie that's supposedly about vapid and narcissistic parasites but ultimately is just a vapid, narcissistic, parasitic film itself.  You wanna watch the wealthy in emotional turmoil, check out Antonioni.  I was just waiting for George C. Scott to pop up from his scene in Hardcore where he watches his daughter in the porno movie and exclaims TURN IT OOOOOOFFFFFFFF!!",

            "content": "So what exactly is Paul Schrader going for with The Canyons? Is it an erotic B-movie sleaze fest? Or pointed commentary on the state of the movie industry? He seems to be aiming for the latter, as the film opens with a series of ghostly images of rundown, long abandoned movie theaters backed by an ominous score. His point, supported by the Kickstarter-funded path he took to getting the film made, is that traditional views of cinema are dead. The moviegoing experience we've all come to expect is no more. What exactly this has to do with the shallow, disaffected cast of misfits who populate The Canyons is a question you'll be asking yourself until the credits finally, thankfully roll. More than likely it was a warning about the ruinous 100 minutes the viewer is about to endure.\n\nThe Canyons isn't another bad movie; the weeks' new releases are littered with those. No, it's exceptionally terrible and the sort of high-profile embarrassment that would get people fired if there was a studio backing it. But this is worse because YOU paid for it, America, and yet don't have the power to really make anyone's head roll over it. There's something fundamentally undemocratic about that, isn't there? Schrader, whose aloof and observational approach would seem to be a perfect match for braggadocios author/screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis' love of the bored and vapid, delivers an uninteresting movie about uninteresting people in the movie biz.\n\nThe last few weeks have seen Schrader attempting to convince people that this isn't just the Lindsay Lohan porn movie, but the sad thing is it would be more interesting if it was. Certainly the scummy mood, stilted dialogue and half-baked acting have it resembling those comically terrible Brock Landers movies from Boogie Nights. And to be fair, it's not really Lohan's fault. Perhaps she's drawing from her own troubled, empty life, but she makes the most out of a badly written character in a cesspool of badly written ones. She plays Tara, the spoiled arm candy to Christian (James Deen), a soulless, arrogant, and Machiavellian rich kid who wields his power as a producer of crappy movies like a weapon. Not that he really truly cares about any of it, and in true Ellis fashion he only does it so daddy won't put a freeze on his trust fund.\n\nWhat really drives Christian is the ability to control and manipulate others, most especially Tara. He can't stand the idea that she has any sort of life that doesn't revolve around him, so he begins to go a little crazy suspecting she may be sleeping around with Ryan (Nolan Funk), the hunky lead in his new low-budget horror movie. Ryan, who lives with Christian's naive assistant Gina (Amanda Brooks), only got the job at Tara's urging, which adds fuel to the speculative fire. This is one of those movies where everybody lies and then lies about the lies, and the truth only comes out when it can cause the most emotional damage. So when he's not obsessing over her infidelity, Christian sleeps around with whoever he wants, and then scours the Internet for random dudes/couples to bang Tara while he occasionally participates. Without much in the way of rhyme or reason it veers into psycho-thriller territory, perhaps in a lazy attempt to recall the psychotic wackos of Ellis' American Psycho or The Rules of Attraction. Those films at least had competent acting behind them with Christian Bale and James Van Der Beek (last time you'll see him praised on this site!), while Deen acts like someone who has never been asked to do much beyond drop his pants. Glimpses of the old Lohan peek through now and again, and with her aged-beyond-belief face and nervous twitchiness, she resembles a wannabe starlet who has seen and done too much. It's not a perfect performance, sometimes she wildly misplays a scene's emotional beats, but it's good to see her not phoning this one in. The same can't be said for Gus Van Sant, the director who makes an unnecessary cameo as Christian's psychiatrist. Perhaps he had another movie shooting next door and wandered in, but whatever the reason he shouldn't have been there.\n\nPerversion and depravity would seem to jibe well with Ellis' usual explorations of the superficial, but a micro-budget coupled with ill-prepared talent and a flat script is too much to overcome. Sluggish pacing stretches an already interminable runtime, and with all of the shoddy elements The Canyons resembles test subject put together by a bunch of amateurs, but definitely not the work of seasoned professionals.",

What follows is a very slow burn of a thriller. At times, I was wondering what was the point of everything. Then in the last 20 or so minutes, the film finally starts to come together.

Lindsay, on the other hand, is mesmerizing, if not always in a good way.\nShe's like Frankenstein as Mary Shelly originally conceived the character... breathtakingly beautiful, yet still a monster no less.\n\nTo their credit, Paul Schrader, writer Bret Easton Ellis, and producer by Braxton Pope cast Lindsay in the lead role when no one else would have her. She was at the very nadir of her once promising film career.\n\nTherefore, watching the film, you can't help but root for her-not her character, but her. Each time she appears on screen, and she mostly monopolizes it, the film becomes engrossing because you never know which Lindsay Lohan you'll see.\n\nAt times, she's very convincing as the conflicted and love-lorn Tara, an actress who is in a dysfunctional relationship with Christian (James Deen), a Hollywood trust fund baby who pretends to make movies so daddy won't cut him off.\n\nBut the dialog is often so unnatural even she can't pull off the scene, much less co-stars Tenille Houston, Amanda Brooks and Nolan Gerard Funk. Why is Lindsay even on the same set with them? Oh... right, she couldn't get work anywhere else.\n\nGranted the film was shot on a shoe string budget; that still doesn't excuse the terrible lighting and makeup. At times, Lindsay looks truly seductive. At others, especially during close ups, you'll gasp.\n\nShe channels Divine, the transvestite actor filmmaker John Waters made famous in \"Pink Flamingos.\" What is with that eye makeup?\n\nLohan's much ballyhooed nude scenes are way over-hyped. \"The Canyons\" is billed as an erotic thriller, but the sex scenes are neither erotic nor thrilling. If sex is this mechanical in Hollywood, it's a wonder anyone gets laid. And, this is where the plot really breaks down.\n\nChristian gets off watching Tara have sex with other guys while he films them. He also likes engaging in four-way, guy-on-guy, girl-on-girl sex. Plus, he's having an affair on the side with his yoga instructor.\n\nYet, he becomes insanely jealous when he finds out Tara is sleeping with a young actor (Funk), whom she once dated. His jealously totally lacks credibility, yet it basically drives the plot.\n\nWhen they're not having sex, the characters are meeting for lunch, having drinks, or engrossed with their cell phones. Toss in a gratuitous murder and call it a wrap.\n\nThe opening credits is the best moment in the film. They roll over eerie shots of abandoned movie theaters. Beyond that, though, \"The Canyons\" has nothing to do with movie theaters, or making movies.\n\nHopefully, Lindsay will survive this film. She shows flashes of real acting ability and deserves a shot at something better. As for \"The Canyons,\" there isn't one deep enough to toss this film into.",

            "content": "Before Veronica Mars success on the high-profile crowd-sourced fundraising site Kickstarter, there was The Canyons. Written by novelist Bret Easton Ellis (American Psycho, Less Than Zero) and directed by Oscar-nominee Paul Schrader (Affliction, Taxi Driver), it promised to be a more legit opportunity for fans to fund a real movie, something they could actually see on the big screen. The production successfully raised a budget of $150,000 with rewards like script coverage by Schrader, working out at the gym with Ellis and his physical trainer, and Robert DeNiro's moneyclip from Taxi Driver. The little production that could got even more press when tabloid darling Lindsay Lohan was cast as the female lead. The New York Times released a lengthy blow-by-blow in January of the tumultuous film shoot, mostly centered around Lohan and her antics. It was a fascinating read. The Canyons is a better behind-the-scenes news article than a competent sexy thriller. The best actor in the film is a prominent male porn star. Make of that what you will.\r\n\r\nIn the City of Angels, Christian (James Deen) is spinning a web of deceit. He regularly invites other men over to have sex with his girlfriend, Tara (Lohan). His assistant, Gina (Amanda Brooks), has a boyfriend, Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk), who wants to be an actor. She convinces Christian to offer him a small part. It just so happens that Ryan and Tara used to date back when they were struggling actors. They've also started a new affair. Christian suspects something is amiss and schemes to punish and destroy Ryan and his dreams of Hollywood fame. Meanwhile Ryan is trying to scheme himself to get Tara to finally leave the rich and luxurious clutches of Christian. \r\n\r\nWoe to thee expecting a plot or characters worth watching. Despite the presence of artistic heavyweights like Ellis and Schrader, The Canyons is a movie that does a disservice to the word bland. This movie is powerfully bland. There's just nothing to attach to other than the fascination of Lohan. The characters are posh, privileged, unlikable, and morally slipshod, which is the Ellis specialty. Except in the past he's given them personalities to go along with their nihilistic narcissism. Christian is a pale likeness of Patrick Bateman and has no charisma or intriguing sense of darkness to him, something to keep you watching. Mostly he's just a jerk. But he's not even an interesting jerk. The plot is a merry-go-round of infidelity, as numerous characters have secret paramours, which makes their cumulative jealousy all the more absurd. What does Christian have to get so upset about? He invites men and women over to have sex with Tara. They even engage in a foursome. I suppose there is the limp argument that he's not in control, but how tedious is that? Ultimately, you're watching Bland Character A complain to Bland Character B about how unhappy Bland Character C makes them. This scenario repeats many times. I wish there was more gratuitous nudity to hold my attention. It's a soap opera that you want to turn off. The entire screenplay feels like weak, reheated Ellis depravity without anything memorable. \r\n\r\nHere's an example of how lazy the screenwriting gets: after Christian is done having sex with Cynthia (Tenille Houston), a yoga teacher (that's one way of doing it), they relax. In this scene, Cynthia asks questions that have no real purpose other than to advance exposition, and it's sorely obvious. It's all, \"What did she mean by that?\" and, \"Why would you go to this place?\" Every screenplay has exposition but the trick is to make it as invisible as possible. Pacific Rim did a particularly great job at masking its exposition so that it arrived in a way that didn't feel like the plot was stalling. The fact that Ellis doesn't even put forth any effort to disguise what is naked and clunky exposition just speaks to an overall sense of lethargy or indifference on his part with the script. I wouldn't be surprised if Ellis knocked this out over one long, monotonous weekend. \r\n\r\nThe other mortal misstep is that Schrader makes the movie so serious that you'll find yourself laughing at spots. This is not great material to begin with, nor compelling characters, but it could have, emphasis on \"could,\" worked had the production embraced its silly sense of luridness. There's a reason we're more forgiving of late-night thrillers with copious amounts of vice. They accept their identity. I think Schrader may have read Ellis' lackluster script and envisioned another Looking for Mr. Goodbar (I'm not confusing it with Schrader's own American Gigolo). This is not a morality tale but Schrader seems to think otherwise. I don't sense any cohesive commentary about young people and their sexual mores or the predominance of technology and its negative impact on human connection. Christian and Tara text at the dinner table. He films \"movies\" on his phone of their sexual trysts with strangers culled from Craigstlist. There's a big difference just including these items and actually having something to say. Schrader opens and closes the film with montages of rundown movie theaters, many shuttered up and long out of business. What am I supposed to decipher from this exactly? Tara asks Gina, who works in the movies, when was the last time she went and saw a movie, a film that honestly made her feel something. Gina is stumped, but that's all you get for that thematic reference. Is Schrader taking out his ire on the state of Hollywood filmmaking and the studio system? Regardless, you won't feel anything form The Canyons either.\r\n\r\nSo what truly is the draw here? Why would someone want to watch this movie? The only factor I can surmise, beyond simple curiosity, is the presence of Lohan. I doubt this movie would seem as compelling absent the troubled actress. Would people be clamoring to see this movie if it starred, say, Hilary Duff instead? She's been out of the limelight seemingly as long as Lohan but she's also had a stable personal life. I won't pretend I'm above this. I watched The Canyons out of sheer curiosity, and that inquisitiveness hinged upon Lohan. She hasn't starred in a theatrically released movie since 2007's I Know Who Killed Me (my #2 worst film of that year), and she's fresh off the infamous Lifetime movie of Elizabeth Taylor that many websites turned into a derisive drinking game. There's an undeniable rubbernecking quality here not to mention the prurient promise of Lohan taking off her clothes. To pacify the curious, Lohan has two scenes where she goes topless, one during the aforementioned foursome. If you're planning a hot night home alone with you an your VOD, good luck trying to make sense of that foursome. It's shot with all these blinky lasers bouncing off people's writhing bodies, losing just about whatever small sensuality the scene may have gained. I'd expect the scenes to land on the Internet in a matter of days, if not hours, so that salient selling point will be moot. Lohan's acting on the other hand is less deserving of attention. There are a few moments where it feels like character and actress have merged, and her crying jags about lost opportunities, dreams gone awry, feel inescapably real for her. I think she would have been better served with a less solemn tone and more sudsy and sundry thrills. \r\n\r\nDeen has the best feel for Ellis' pulpy material, and while he doesn't really click as a menacing figure even as he's murdering people (he's too much a Jewish boy next door type), he does come across as a megalomaniacal creep. Perhaps my expectations were just too low for a porn actor, so my apologies for my prejudices. Given the right material, Deen may surprise (not by his full-frontal nude scene). I do think that Katie Morgan (Zack and Miri Make a Porno) has the ability to transcend porn. She's just so effortlessly charming, something that most of the actors in The Canyons have trouble with. Funk (House at the End of the Street) cannot get a good grip on his character's emotions and thus he just seems pissy all the time. I'll spare the other actors mentioning but I feel the need to inform that Osar-nominated director Gus Van Sant plays Christian's trust fund-mandated therapist. Guess what doesn't work well?\r\n\r\nThose seeking an outrageous exploitation film filled with soapy sex and intrigue, as well as pretty people behaving very badly, will be surely disappointed with The Canyons. I guess it all depends on your expectation level for a film that bypassed the traditional financial system and crowd-sourced on the basis of Schrader and Ellis' notoriety. I'm glad that both artists found a conduit for collaboration and found a way to make it happen on the (relative) cheap. I just don't know why it had to be this crummy story. Thematically, Schrader and Ellis seem to be completely at odds, which results in a super serious movie about terrible, and terribly boring, characters doing little else but indulging in vices and whining (also a vice?). Without the presence of Lohan to add a curiosity factor, there is honestly no good reason to spend good money on this dithering project. The moderate success of The Canyons is somewhat comforting, but really, this wasn't a movie that deserved people's donations, and it certainly doesn't deserve your time. \r\n\r\nNate's Grade: D+",

We set ourselves in relationships and situations that are the downfall of our true selves, because there is some glimmer it will put us in the spotlight briefly... On top of that, there is enough eroticism, including male full frontal, to drop a few jaws and keep them drooling. Bret Easton Ellis has became a master at making popularity, fame and wealth seem cool, while showing the dark underbelly of it all simultaneously. This could have easily come off as high-camp. but stays just under that radar, making it an intricately interesting story. The cinematography and poetic license is all well done.. The acting is steady, and the direction is layered. Just as you are laughing, you cringe... Just as you are turned on, your feel the inner turmoil of characters going through the actions just to get to tomorrow...

            "content": "The Canyons explores the dark side of human nature, while trying to offer critiques on the technology obsession of modern society and a dying film industry.  The film follows the story Christian (James Deen) a manipulative movie producer who makes movies to keep his father off his back and to keep his trust fund.  Trouble stirs when Christian suspects that his girlfriend Tara (Lindsey Lohan) is seeing another man.  The Canyons is a twisted and erotic tale of the darkest parts of the human mind.\n\nDirector Paul Schrader does a good job of creating the sexually tangled and sadistic lifestyle of his characters on the surface.  But the characters feel a little flat, in part due to some bad acting and the direction of the movie goes astray is with its attempt at cultural critiques, the critiques end up to thinly spread over multiple subject matters.  Whether it is society's obsession with technology or The Canyons perceived decline of the film industry it's hard to identify the message that the film is so desperately grasping for.  The cinematography is rather beautiful for the most part and the movie is competently edited.  However this goes out the window during the opening scene for the most part, which is awkwardly shot and edited together.  The film does have an overbearing use of cutaways that can become annoying at some parts.  For instance in the opening scene in the middle of a conversation in a restaurant the film has a sweeping crane shot of a bar on the other side of the restaurant, this all done in the middle of the dialog.  \n\nThe Canyons is a movie that features one of the strangest acting ensembles ever assembled in a movie. A cast that ranges from porn star James Deen to award winning director Gus Van Sant who plays Dr. Campbell, Christian's therapist.  It's a daring move to cast a porn star as a leading man and judging from James Deen's performance it's a move that won't be attempted again anytime soon.  A reason behind Deen's casting though could be the movie's various sexually twisted scenes.  The movie sports some of the most sadistically erotic scenes that I have ever seen in a film, the scenes will leave you disgusted (or aroused depending on whether that's your thing or not) which I'm pretty sure is the movies intention.  The movie at times borders on being soft-core porn, but one that sports a sinister quirk.\n\n\nThe big draw of the movie, or the big question that everyone wants to know is if Lindsey Lohan puts on a good performance.  While it's not the cannonball into the pool sort of performance that some may be hoping for out of Lindsey, it is a foot in the water, towards the right direction.  She puts on a solid performance and is undoubtedly the best actor/actress in the film, though her performance is nothing to rave about.  \n\nThe Canyons is a movie that I would tell people to go see, not because it's a good movie, but that it is an experience much in the way that Harmony Korine's Spring Breakers is an experience.  The movie creates a stylistic, materialistic and infernal hell, but the bad acting occasionally pulls you out of the experience of the movie along with the movie being over packed use of commentary.  The movie is gorgeous at parts and stylish, but it's bad acting and lack of execution and direction keep the movie from becoming an in-depth exploration into the dark and sexually twisted hellscape side of the human experience.",

Gone are the days of \"Herbie Fully Loaded\" and \"Mean Girls\", Lohan has completely obliterated her former Disney charm and has set on a course of rehab and full on nude scenes. And from a very heterosexual man, I cannot completely complain. Lohan is the driving force in this film, directed by Paul Schrader, known for his collaborations with Martin Scorsese, and written by author Bret Easton Ellis of \"American Psycho\" fame. For an actress returning from quite the hiatus, Lohan grabs a hold of this role and never lets go, commanding attention as the sexpot girlfriend whose open sexuality and conflicted feelings between two men turn the Hollywood love triangle dynamic on its head. Reminiscent of Soderbergh's casting of pornstar Sasha Grey in \"The Girlfriend Experience\", Schrader brings on male pornstar James Deen, who actually surprises as being an okay actor. Only flashing the moneymaker in one scene, he relies on dialogue and attitude to get him through the film and even though most of his deliveries are flat, the Hollywood bravado rings through. The story is nothing new, with a jealous boyfriend (Deen) keeping tabs on his girlfriend (Lohan) and finding out she has a secret lover (Nolan Gerard Funk). The unraveling eventual leads to a violent conclusion that slams a giant dot on the exclamation point that is this film. In the case of being memorable, \"The Canyons\" definitely is, with the reemergence of Lohan in her sexual prime. However, on the scale of being a good film, this remains entirely entertaining but extremely lacking and without Lohan, would likely be absolutely worthless.",

If I am correct, I believe this is the first known Kickstarter film (that was produced), Lindsay's first film since rehab and porn star James Deen's acting debut (excluding all of the straight porn he has been in).\n\nLindsay does a pretty good acting job given the uneven script. She tries her best and elevates each scene she is in and makes the other actors better for it.  There are times that Mr. Deen is a little stiff and as the lead, he makes it difficult to get past the sterile and stiff performance. But once he has someone with acting experience behind them, he warms up a bit. \n\nDon't be surprised at all of the nudity and and sex involved, but considering I heard there was a ton of full frontal nudity, there really isn't that much at all.  You see more full frontal of the guys than the girls, but even Lindsay shows off her boobs. \n\nWhat's hurting the story most is the uneven script. It's unclear what the point of the film ends up being.  It's like standing in line, things are going on around you, but it feels as though you never reach the destination. Basically, Lindsay's character is dating James Deen's character. They are in an open relationship and often invite others to join them. She manages to get an ex-lover an acting job on Deen's movie. The ex-Oliver's girlfriend is Deen's assistant and he is obsessed with Lindsay's character. Add to that all the men in the film are openly willing to try anything once, there is a shady psychiatrist involved, an openly gay filmmaker, a possible closeted man, and a yoga instructor who is sleeping with both Deen and has had relations with the ex-lover. Got all that?  Basically it is a microcosm and bed of sexual exploration. \n\nIt's slightly unbelievable that even in this small community, all of these people are connected and have had relations with everyone else. I know that there are certain industries and communities that are like this, but the yoga instructor connection is a bit much. \n\nIn the end, one of the characters connected to the others is dead and new relationships are formed while others end. I don't want to spoil the ending, but that's impossible because there is none. \n\nI get that this movie was made on the cheap, but the script didn't have to be. Bret Easton Eliis has written many twisted tales in novel form, and perhaps he is best sticking with that genre. This was supposed to be Mr. Schadder's big come back but even though the director is great in scenes maneuvering around the amazing and beautiful house where it is mostly shot, the beginning restaurant scene feels as though it was filmed with one actor at a time and cut together after to make it appear as if the actors were all together at once. \n\nIf you have done any research on this film, you've probably heard about all of the troubles with this shoot. Lindsay was going through rehab/probation, James Deen was finally not doing a porn movie, Paul was trying to make a comeback as an artistic director and Mr. Ellis was trying to break into the screenwriting business  plus, this was a Kickstarter film.  Given all of that, I was a little more lenient on my rating. I really wanted to like this movie and hoped it would succeed, but in the end it's just blah.  \n\nThe premise was better than the execution and while \"it's not The Hills\", it's not even the great indie it hoped to be. I am truly sorry for that because there were a lot of great things involved in this film despite all of the troubles involved. I'm sure this passion project was an experience that everyone involved will look back on and realize that they are better off for having triumphed and achieved. \n\n\"The Canyons\" is not a horrible movie, but it's not that great either. I just wish they would have tied up the ending because its almost as if it is missing a 4th act....",

Paul Schrader's The Canyons fails at keeping the viewer interested, and James Deen falls flat sometimes; on the other hand Lindsay Lohan, is convincing in his role as the miserable, unhappy Tara.",

The story is repugnant and boring, and all of the characters are soulless, vacuous and empty.  Granted, I'd heard about how bad this movie was before I even saw it, but I still expected a little more from Paul Schrader and Bret Easton Ellis.  The story is about some trust-fund kid (James Deen) who's also producing a movie so that his (unseen) dad will get off of his back.  His live-in girlfriend is played by Lindsay Lohan, and the small cast is rounded out with other characters who know each other, and sleep or have slept with one another.  Still, most of the movie is just boring, lifeless dialogue interspersed with some of the most unerotic sex I've ever seen, which includes a foursome.  I mean, what were these people thinking?  The only redeeming qualities are some good soundtrack selections and good camerawork.  That's it.  It's best just to take most people's word and just skip this trash.",

Deen can't act and I was distracted by Lindsay's puffy face & duck lips through the whole film. \n\nThe Bret Easton Ellis story might have had a chance with some unknown actors who could act (or Christian Bale as Christian would have been brilliant.)  So if you wanna see Lindsay nude, skip the film & check out Youtube or the internet. My thx to the BF for burning it for me.",

There is something about her that just makes you interested and she is the only reason to watch this crap.\nFirst off, its painfully obvious the actors are reading a script, im not sure if its the writing to blame or the actors.\nNext, james deen should probably take many acting classes because i believed nothing about him or his decisions. He was good for the first five minutes of screen time, then its like wtf.\nAlso, there are a bunch of sequences where the camera follows an actor around for a long time and you can tell that the actors are trying not to look into the camera. \nThis movie looks and feels like a more titalating soderberg movie and it feels like it. Its day to day and boring as all hell but it looks good and the writing fits. But at the end of the day you not a single shit is to be given about anything and it just becomes dull and stupid.\nMaybe i dont understand day to day life movies where nothing intresting has to happen, but its a movie! I expect to be entertained not bored out pf mind!",
