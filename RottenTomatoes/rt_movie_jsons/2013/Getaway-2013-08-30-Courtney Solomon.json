Admittedly, yes, it's a bad film on a technical and storytelling level. The story is stupid, the acting is phoned in, blah, blah, blah, but I found it to still be an entertaining film about a man trying to save  his wife by following the whims of a crazy man who has kidnapped her (While also teaming up with a hacker played by Selena Gomez).  Unlike most other films, the scenes of vehicular mayhem were done with practical effects, leading to some pretty spectacular action scenes. It won't engage your brain and you'll probably hate it because it is not a high-caliber action film, but I enjoyed it on a brainless B-movie level in the vain of Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever (Which I also enjoyed). I wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than fans of stupid, garbage, trashy films, but for fans of such works, Getaway is a very serviceable and fun film.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, there s no escape for you - it s time to review Getaway.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Alas, I wish there had been a way to stay away from Getaway.\n\nGREG: Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) is a former race car driver with a past. He comes home to find that his wife has been abducted. He receives an anonymous phone call telling him to find a special car (a Shelby Mustang Super Snake) that has been outfitted with internet cameras that can watch him drive both from inside and outside the car. Once Magna is inside the car the anonymous villain calls him at regular intervals with instructions to do dastardly deeds with the car or risk the harm of his lovely wife.\n\nSCOTT: At one point a girl in her late teens (Selena Gomez) jumps into the car, points a gun at Magna, and demands possession of the car, claiming it is hers.  Magna is able to disarm her and is ordered by the villain to keep her with him while he completes his remaining tasks.  The girl is very tech-savy and manages to use the cameras against the villain as well as figure out the villain s ultimate goal, which she and Magna attempt to thwart.\n\nGREG: Scott, I m not against the odd improbable plot device to set up the situation for a movie, but the premise that we re asked to swallow in Getaway is an extremely odd device. We re asked to believe that some disembodied voice (ala Charlie s Angels) is going to control the acts of a desperate man. Second, we re asked to believe that a techno-kid is going to aid the man. But the most unbelievable thing (that we can disclose without exposing too much) is when Magna extracts the gun from the kid and the voice says  Kill her!  Magna does the heroic thing and defies the voice (although risking his wife s safety, which is his major motivation) only to have the voice tell him that it is  Good - as you ll need her for what awaits you.  I suppose if Magna had killed the girl as ordered the movie would have been over prematurely.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, this movie should serve as a warning to future filmmakers, and the warning should read,  How not to make a movie.   The scene you mention is only one of 50 scenes that baffled me.  I suppose Magna s decision to spare the girl s life is supposed to endear us to him, but this scene occurs right after another scene in which Magna rams his car at high speed at dozens of cars, presumably driven by innocent people, and through innumerable Christmas displays, also filled with innocent people. So there is absolutely no doubt that Magna is willing to kill many other people (including dozens of law enforcement personnel) to save his wife, a fact that I found reprehensible.  But let s not forget the main problem with the movie, which is that 60 of the 90 minutes were devoted to car chases, car collisions, and cars turning into accordion-like hunks of metal.  That means we saw a half-hour of plot, if you could call it that, spread over 90 minutes.  For me it was torture.\n\nGREG: It s true, this movie is thin on plot and high on octane. I didn t think it possible, but Getaway is a poor approximation of the Fast and Furious movies. And those are already a poor approximation of good entertainment. This movie is derivative of a genre of movie that should have no derivative. The one thing I did like about this movie was Selena Gomez. She comes to us from the Disney kid-actor-factory where she starred in the TV series The Wizards of Waverly Place. Unlike so many of the young people who survive that teen-actor puppy mill (Miley Cyrus, for example), Gomez appears to be easing herself into a more adult career path. While there really wasn t much for her to do or say (and she says  sh*t  a LOT in this film) she does it with conviction and we believe that she is the character she claims to be playing. Kudos Selena.\n\nSCOTT: You re right, Selena Gomez is the lone high point of a film that has more low points than Death Valley.  This movie reminds me of the typical Tom Cruise movie of late -- there is a premium on action and a pittance of character development.  Magna doesn t change as a character, he merely survives the ordeal thrown at him.  In fact, if there is a hero in this story, it is the car he drives.  His car apparently has its own Iron Man suit, indestructibly colliding with countless cop-cars which are crushed like beer cans in a fraternity house.  By the way, most drunken frat boys are probably too sensible and mature to enjoy Getaway.\n\nGREG: I struggled with giving this film a zero rating, which I reserve for the worst of the worst. But Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez both give everything they ve got although they re not given much to work with. I give Getaway 1 Reel out of 5. Both characters try hard but they are mere shadows of heroes, doing the things that are expected of them to be heroic without being actual heroes. I give them just 1 Hero out of 5. Movie:  Hero: \n\nSCOTT: Getaway is a 90-minute collision-fest that is saturated with the senseless repeated bludgeoning of automobiles.  I have no problem giving this movie as much as 1 Reel because I enjoyed seeing the lovely Sofia, Bulgaria, where the movie takes place.  Selena and Sofia make the film reel-worthy.  The car and its ordeals are more of a hero than Magna, and any time an inanimate object shows more transformation than the human who drives it, we have a problem.  So I give Getaway one mere Hero out of 5 as well. Movie:  Hero:",

On the other end is a mysterious man known only as The Voice (Jon Voight) who reveals himself as the kidnapper of Magna's wife. The man tells Magna that he must follow a set of instructions precisely in order to be reunited with his wife. The Voice orders Magna to steal a specially customised Shelby Mustang from a parking garage. The Voice warns Magna that if he does not follow the instructions or is caught, Leanne will die. Magna sees two police officers chasing him and speeds off. Being a skilled driver, he is able to evade them with ease, eventually setting a trap to cause one to crash into the other. Despite more police cars joining the pursuit, Magna is able to out maneuver them. Some time later, Magna is again contacted by The Voice, who directs him towards his first task. He tells Magna to speed up and take some perilous turns, eventually being forced to crash through a park, ice rink, and shopping center, nearly killing numerous civilians in the process. The Voice calls to congratulate him and tells him to keep moving. Magna is ordered to crash into a water truck and run through a red lighted intersection, causing accidents in his wake. Magna is then ordered to park in a construction zone and await further instructions. While Magna is waiting, a young woman known only as The Kid (Selena Gomez) attempts to steal Magna's car. The Voice calls and orders Magna to kill The Kid. Magna refuses, and The Voice says that keeping her alive was the right choice, as he will need her help. As Magna and The Kid drive off, with more police in pursuit, she reveals that the Mustang is, in fact, her car, and that she was told, by a police officer, it was stolen. Magna realizes that their meeting was orchestrated by The Voice. After the Voice assigns Magna another destructive task, The Kid reveals herself as a skilled computer hacker and the daughter of the C.E.O of a large bank. The Voice contacts Magna again and orders him to upload the contents of a USB flash drive into a computer before 11:30 pm. Upon reaching the designated area, a power plant, The Kid attempts to hack the computer in order to contact the police. She appears to have succeeded, only for The Voice to cut her off, revealing that he set up the computer as a trap for her. The plant suddenly overloads and explodes, destroying itself and blacking out a large portion of the city. The Voice gives Magna his final task: to rob the bank owned by The Kid's father. The Kid points out that there is no actual money at her father's bank; it is an investment firm which holds all of its assets on computers. Gradually, the duo realizes that they are not actually committing a heist, but are merely providing a distraction for the police while The Voice executes the real robbery and subsequently frames them for it...\n\nThere is no CGI in any of the car crash scenes. All the crashes in the movie are real. 130 cars were wrecked in the making of this movie. The production had its own junkyard on set to store the wreckage. The Shelby Super Snake Mustang is such a rare car, that Shelby had to make cars especially for this production. To catch all the breakneck action from both inside and outside the Shelby Super Snake the director used a variety of cameras, numbering anywhere from 18 to 42, in any given scene. The cameras ranged in size and format, including state of the art digital RED Epics. \"Getaway\" was panned by film critics and was considered to be the worst film of 2013. The critical consensus states: \"Monotonously fast-paced to the point of exhaustion, Getaway offers a reminder of the dangers in attempting to speed past coherent editing, character development, sensible dialogue, and an interesting plot\". The film won the Moldy Tomato award for the worst-reviewed film of 2013, and is one of the worst ever reviewed films on the site. IGN said \"Not even the gruffly likable Ethan Hawke can make the murky, messy car chase movie Getaway worthwhile thanks to its inane script and poorly conceived action sequences\". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called it a \"brainless chase flick that doesn't even offer guilty pleasures.\" Ethan Hawke doesn¬¥t carry the part (despite some driving skills) and the always cute Selena Gomez looks lost together with Jon Voight. The plot has so many holes and the whole movie is just a poor excuse for making an epileptic crazy car crash movie that makes no sense.",

So he crosscuts flashback shots of Magna discovering his apartment ransacked and his wife gone with practically eroticized shots of the car he'll spend most of the next hour and a half in.

What, exactly, remains vague. A movie like Getaway really only has one deceptively simple job: to punch viewers repeatedly in the adrenal gland for a little while and leave them feeling like they've been in the chase themselves.

Ethan Hawke headlines the picture, along with Selena Gomez, but it's still pretty much a movie about a car. Which for some reason is largely bulletproof. He also complicates things with the ridiculously implausible character he gives Gomez to play, a plot-hole panacea meant to lead the script out of whatever corner it has gotten itself into at any given time.

That's just one of the questions you can't help but ask while watching the film, unless you can reduce your neurological functioning to brainstem only.\r\n\r\nAll that aside, Getaway might still eke out a pass if the car chases could earn one on their own.

            "content": "Thursday, June 19, 2014\r\n\r\n(2013) Getaway\r\nACTION THRILLER\r\n\r\n There's not a single credible action sequence throughout the entire movie even though it's supposed to be an action thriller. Filmed in Bulgaria, even though there were times it looked like that it was filmed in Germany.  The opening has former race car driver, Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) blackmailed to steal someone's car to perform some dangerous tasks after kidnapping his wife.  This mysterious stranger also threatened to kill his wife if conditions are not met, which is not to be caught by the police, and to complete whatever instructions given.  And along the way, he picks up the original owner of the car, whom Brent refers to as \"The Kid\", and she's played by Selena Gomez who's the only daughter of a owner of one of the most prestigious banks around the area. She also happens to be a whiz at computers as well. \r\n\r\nNow, I don't mind this ridiculous set up, but when it comes to the action sequences, I have to say that they're less than inspiring which uses many close-up 1 second shots, subliminal images and quick cuts.  We see the car crashes, but there's zero effect about how they come about in the first place.  At least 80% of the car crashes shown here, viewers have zero knowledge about how they happen.  It's like witnessing the actual crashes happen without knowing how they got started. I mean, why would I want to see that.       It's one of the worst photographed car sequences ever caught on film since many of the shots, are shown either from the passenger side or from the hood.  There are no shots shown from the air or on from other angles. Therefore, more than half the time, viewers are unable to figure out what they're doing or where they're.  Yes, it's really that frustrating, especially if it didn't even use any CGI, they should get another well known director.\r\n\r\n2 out of 4 stars",

            "content": "So despite this films title the plot isn't actually about a getaway no Sir, its more along the lines of someone having to complete missions in a time limit or his wife dies. Yep that's the whole plot in a nutshell, Ethan Hawke is trapped within a souped-up GT500 Super Snake Mustang and must do whatever the mystery voice on his phone says or his kidnapped wife gets it. There are two problems with this concept...1. its completely ridiculous and 2. Hawke picks up Selena Gomez along the way.\n\nFirst off the mystery voice and lips we see are obviously Jon Voight, there is no mystery at all, its Jon Voight, moving on. The next massively glaring issue is the car, the actual idea behind this film isn't too bad despite playing out like a [i]GTA[/i] videogame. The silly thing is the location for this action is Sofia, Bulgaria (for some reason) and generally in that country you probably won't see highly souped-up Mustangs. So the fact that Hawk is tearing around the city doing all these crazy things is completely idiotic because firstly the car stands out like a sore thumb so there is no way in hell you could disappear or be remotely inconspicuous...thusly you'd be spotted a mile away by everybody, and secondly the police would literately lock down the city. The fact Hawke is able to quietly drive around in his burbling Mustang with generally no attention is absurd.\n\nThat's the main issue which lets down the entire plot, it just doesn't work, but there are many others. I'm still not really sure why Voight goes to all that trouble with Hawke behind the wheel, surely he could do what he intended stealthily? the fact they cause so much mayhem just means there are tonnes of mobile police units around. On another point I see absolutely no reason why Gomez's character was required. Voight's mystery character sets her up with Hawke but there is no real need for her, she is literately just there to gain a wider audience.\n\nThe other thing that really made me giggle to myself was the poorly forced notion that Gomez's character is some kind of petrol head and the Mustang is actually hers...which she modded herself! as if!!. She reels off all this car jargon in a lame attempt to try and make you believe she's a cool cat and she may be of some use to Hawke's character in the film. Of course she is a nerdy techno kid so she does come in handy hacking into all the digital cams that have been fixed around the car and naturally she grows to like Hawke's character and wants to help him blah blah blah.\n\nI'm not saying this film should be anything epic, the film was released under the Dark Castle Entertainment label which is basically a straight to DVD type get up so in affect you get what you pay for. As I said its not all awful though, the idea is sound and its directed well to be honest. Instead of regular filming we see the main two car occupants through the various in-car digi cams which Voight's character uses to watch them. Its nothing that incredible but it adds a nice touch of originality to an otherwise slightly unoriginal idea, it does looks good at times.\n\nThe other main hook is the car chases and car wrecks you see throughout the film. Think along the lines of 'Ronin' and you're not far off, its not as slick as that film and the fact its all at night means you don't see everything clearly but I can't deny some of it was impressive. Totally daft how these shitty old Bulgarian police cars manage to keep up with this hyper Mustang (or so we're lead to believe, it ain't no rice racer) and its utterly hilarious how this Mustang gets into so many prangs and collisions but suffers hardly any damage!! Its so obvious they wanted the car to remain intact for as long as possible, to remain recognisable, they were probably under instructions by the folk at Mustang. Unfortunately it adds even more to the already high levels of unrealistic nonsense and takes you out of the film completely. At one point Hawke's character slams the car bonnet first into a police car, shunting him off the road, yet the Mustangs headlights still work with no sign of damage!\n\nTowards the end we do get some twists and turns which kinda work but leave it feeling a bit convoluted. Again in order to gain a wider audience they have cast a real duo of classic bad guys leading up to Voight...enter Bruce Payne and Paul Freeman. Their roles are so so small so don't get excited, like I said they're there just to add a bit of class but really with such small parts anyone could of played their roles. Them being there doesn't change anything or make the film better. Its a throw away flick which is a shame because it could of been much better if they ironed out some of the silliness. There really is so much stuff that just doesn't add up and we don't really learn who Voight's character is or what is overall game plan is, he's just pinching loads of money via computers in an extremely over complicated way it seems. If you like cars/car chases then this may grab your attention, otherwise it offers nothing really.",

            "content": "Well aware that director Courtney Solomon is an inexperienced and poor film maker as the creator of the critically panned Dungeons & Dragons film as well as An American Haunting, I went into Getaway to see just how he would mess up this one while also hoping for a decent lead from Ethan Hawke.\n\nBefore I delve into details, I will say that Ethan Hawke gives a decent performance. While Getaway is a far from good film, Ethan Hawke manages to give a lead performance which has a real rough edge to it. It certainly isn't his best, but his line delivery has a lot of grit and intensity to it which makes it more convincing to say that he is actually facing the situations presented to him in the film. Ethan Hawke's natural charisma manages to prove to be a mild benefit to Getaway, and it is arguably the best asset that the film has to boast because the rest is incredibly inferior.\nThe intro scene in Getaway attempts to summarise everything in the story such as the background of the protagonist and the motives for why he has stolen a vehicle in a sequence that flips back and fourth between flashbacks, current day events and the message that main character Brent Magna has been told as justification for him stealing a car. The pace of the film is so fast that if viewers aren't able to feel it right away, they most likely never will. If they do, then at some point during the 90 dull minutes that is Getaway, they will be worn down by its and have given up on it.\nGetaway tries to be a guilty pleasure since it starts off with a car chase and doesn't stop, but in this process it skips past coherent writing, although the weakness of its screenplay is obvious. And there is essentially no plot to it.\nIn an attempt to \"cleverly\" write its excessive amount of cinematography angles into the story, Getaway dictates that the reason there are so many cameras in and around the car are because there is an unnamed man simply called \"The Voice\" who is watching everything inside and outside the car from various cameras which somehow manage to survive the various things that the car hits and come out just fine. There are way too many camera angles that Yaron Levy goes for which proves that he is an inexperienced cinematographer. In a good race or chase movie, the cameras should be more focused on capturing the stunts from a decent distance to reveal the full spectacle of things while in Getaway the camera gets up way to close with everything as it is happening. Every time a small part of the car bumps something, the camera cuts to that and then instantly to the next one. The editing is way too fast and incoherent and it attempts to capture around five camera angles all at once in all the fast paced scenes. The editing deviates between all the angles from inside the car, outside the car and from a distant third person perspective. There isn't enough interesting going on for it to capture and it doesn't capture it well at all. While the cinematography and editing isn't nearly as bad as in Taken 2 or A Good Day to Die Hard, it still fits the context of being very poor form and going into an excessive overkill.\nAnd the musical score has its moments but as a whole is repetitive, generic and reminiscent of every musical score from essentially every racing film ever made. But the one flaw that stands out above all the technical problems is the performance of Selena Gomez.\nI don't know who the hell gave Justin Bieber's ex-girlfriend a role in Getaway because although it is clearly a desperate attempt to capitalise on her fame for the teenage crowds, but the instant she came on screen dressed like her ex-boyfriend when he attempts to act \"gansta\" and pointing a gun at Ethan Hawke I instantly knew that she was a fatal casting error. I don't know if Selena Gomez can act, but she certainly can not convincingly point a gun at Ethan Hawke or be the slightest bit intimidating. And from there she never shuts up. She keeps delivering the poorly conceived dialogue of the film in the most cardboard way possible which reminds us why she is a prime example of the shallow musicians of today who are bereft of any substance instead of style that attempt unsuccessfully to cross over into the acting world. Selena Gomez's crossing is an unsuccessful and unbearable one, one of the worst miscasts I have ever seen in any movie ever. Seriously she is so goddamn annoying that every time she spoke I wanted to punch her square in the face. There is not a single word that she says convincingly, and the fact that the dialogue is already terrible enough just reinforces the weakness of her character and her acting skill. And along with her excessively repetitive line delivery is the fact that her facial gestures never change. They stay frozen with the exact same look as she expresses literally no emotions whatsoever. As weird as it is for me to say, Selena Gomez is actually a worse actress in Getaway than Kristen Stewart was in Twilight because while Kristen Stewart gave an awful acting performance, at least she tried. It didn't seem like she was trying, but she did, and her poorly conceived character fitted into the nature of the poorly conceived story. Selena Gomez does not fit into anything whatsoever at all and is a lot more annoying than Kristen Stewart. Luckily enough, The Golden Raspberry Awards realised this and nominated her for the Worst Actress award. Though the prestigious trophy ended up going to Tyler Perry for his performance in A Madea Christmas, I cannot honestly imagine him being more annoying than Selena Gomez in Getaway. Selena Gomez does nothing in Getaway except give viewers reasons to criticise her and joke about her, and it builds no credibility for her whatsoever. \n\nSo despite a decent leading performance from Ethan Hawke, Getaway owes too much to the many superior racing films that inspired it such as the original Gone in 60 Seconds and fails to pay it back to them by filling its excessively fast paced 90 minutes with excessive overkill of poor cinematography, choppy editing a repetitive musical score and a truly dreadful performance from Selena Gomez.",

However, this time has Ethan Hawke, Selena Gomez, and a Mustang, so it has to be good, right....right? Wrong. For starters, the direction is laughably bad. The car chases (Or should I say car chase, since the film is basically one long chase?) are slow, boring, and edited in a way that makes the Bourne films blush. And then there's the dashboard cam that EVERY car needs to have in EVERY chase. Definitely adds a sense of realism and urgency, right? Ha, nope. Then there's the acting. Ethan Hawke is a great actor, but this film doesn't show it. Selena Gomez is in this for two reasons: Have someone young and currently famous for the young crowd. And meet the requirement of at least one female character. Is she any good? Let's just say no, and end it there. Then there's Jon Voight, who gives a performance that screams how bored he is, while rocking an accent that not even he knows what it's supposed to be. And let's just skip the writing because the more I remember the dialogue, the more I have to tell myself that I can't beat my head against the wall.

In the past I've watched films like Jack & Jill, One Missed Call and Movie 43, each with similar ratings and I actually enjoyed them although they are far from unique, original or quality. The difference is, Getaway really is as bad as people are saying, there is nothing here to praise or anything memorable, it is lacking thought far top to bottom and it's inconceivable as to why. I will try and put whatever strand of story to explain what happens here. A man on a phone tells former racer Brent Magna what to do in a car and meet his demands, and there is a girl helping him. That is it, what attracted talented star Ethan Hawke and cool young star Selena Gomez is beyond me, was it the paycheck? I'd avoid this at all costs. Getaway features lackluster editing that throws mess and chaos all over the screen, and apart from a few cool camera shots that manage to last more than a split second Getaway has poor cinematography, zero imagination and shocking writing. Ethan Hawke shouts, screams and swears, you can tell his acting style is present and his husky voice is cool, and I'll be extremely lenient towards Gomez who is given terrible dialogue, I don't think it's her fault that her lines consisted of \"I hate you\", \"Oh my god\", \"Look out\", all these lines amount to nothing as explosions and gunfire go off all around them. The idea of planting a dozen mini cameras on the modified vehicle feels like a lousy excuse not to shoot with creativity utilising mounted cameras or cranes. Avid action fans will be disappointed and there's not a chance of anyone enjoying this, Getaway genuinely is the definition of a bad movie.",

This is a film that mainly goes for the lowest common dominator. It might not be the worst movie I ever seen, but trust me it got damn close. Let's look at the dumbest use of fast cars, Getaway. \n\nLike I said, there isn't much of a story in this film. A guy named Brent (Ethan Hawke) learns his wife has just been kidnapped and must race against the clock to rescue her from obvious villain (Jon Voight). With the help of an annoying hacker (Selena Gomez) he will do anything to rescue his wife including destroying entire cities and kill hundreds of people. Yeah that's pretty much it. It's like we're stuck in an action rip off of \"The Guilt Trip\". We are stuck in this Fast car with an under acting Ethan Hawke and annoying Disney Star Selena Gomez. The writers try to make her character seem really smart for her age. But it's just not believable at all. I'm not sure if it's the way her role was written or how she delivers her lines but either way I can't buy her as a smart person. Everything just sounds like whiny Bull Crap to me whenever she speaks. Oh did I mention Ethan Hawke doesn't even bother giving a performance? It just looks like he wants this film to be done with so he can get his paycheck. \n\nSometimes, the actions scenes can be  fun. Still, it's not enough to distract anyone from the horrible acting  and lack of story. Even the action scenes can be boring because they go on forever. I swear there is like a 15 minute driving scene that goes on and on and on. So even the good stuff gets just as tired as this formula. \n\nAfter saying all of that, I will this for Getaway, it can be fun to watch with a bunch of bad movie Lovers like I did at the Razzie Preview night. We all had a blast just ripping this movie apart from Selena's terrible acting to the awful dialogue to Jon Voight constantly wanting the two dimwits to go Left for some reason. Otherwise, you probably should stay away from this horrible excuse of a film.  It's just a 90 minute car chase with Selena Gomez as an annoying fairy and Voight telling you \"Your Wife is in another Castle\".",

            "content": "100mph car chases with Selena Gomez holding on for dear life sounds like a curious mix. It really is, Getaway is a turgid mix of everything bad in movies. Ethan Hawke plays Brent Magna, an ex-race driver who is forced into a mission to save his kidnapped wife, alongside the help of a Hacker played by Selena Gomez these two are forced to follow every instruction from a man on the phone. That is it for story, aside from a lousy side plot based on dirty money and ransoms. This 2013 action movie demonstrates a complete lack of quality, it is a getaway from anything redeeming. \r\n\r\nLet's get something clear, that 10% I've given purely goes to the car crashes and stunts which come in the dozens, and look like something out of World's Scariest Police Chases, but you could watch that on YouTube and the videos that will come up will pretty much look identical to Getaway. The absence of the rest of that 90% is largely due to the shocking editing choice, the terrible cinematography and ridiculous camerawork that looks cheap and only adds to the lack of quality here. I can see what Director Courtney Solomon was aiming for: A gritty, realistic car chase movie that puts you in the front seat. Instead he spins you around making you feel queasy with 100mph quick cuts and unfocused shots, you literally cannot tell who is attacking who, why they are doing so and how on earth did that cop car end up tumbling through the air? I'm going to be very lenient on Selena Gomez, who is given possibly the worst script ever, only thing is why didn't she realise the trash she was getting into? Her husky voice is sexy and blunt, yet sadly all of her dialogue consists of \"You're an asshole\", \"Do something!\", \"Go faster\", \"Oh my God\", \"Oh shit\", \"I really hate you right now!\". I'm sure she can do better, her Spring Breakers performance was a good one. This inane shouting goes on for an hour and a half, there are at least 10 car chases in this movie that get worse and worse and even more vapid as they go on. Ethan Hawke man, seriously, you're a very talented guy, why are you in this movie, it's really bad.",

On the way, a girl (Selena Gomez) gets into the car holding gun at Ethan to get out, for the car belongs to her. \n\nGod knows why did I play this movie?

I'll give them credit for having an explained excuse for cameras to be everywhere. Hard to believe the car was still in one piece and didn't need any gas before things were done.

But everything else is generic, extremely convenient, or foolish. I love a good chase, but there are more police cars wrecked here than The Blues Brothers; I didn't realize how boring this looks after a while. You wonder why there seems to be no media attention on an orgy of wrecked Bulgarian police cars (and I'm guessing deaths in the line of duty). Selena Gomez is really shrill and annoying as the passenger, always screaming stuff like \"you're the worst driver ever\" and a lot of techno-babble... why did they not kill her again? It's not like they needed a hostage. How she outsmarts Jon Voight's voice time after time is beyond me. After a lot of destruction that could have easily been avoided, there's a twist at the end that makes the movie pointless.\n\nI guess Getaway may be worth a rental for its driving scenes, but you're not going to like much else about it. It's short and stupid, but it's not like the movie angered me.",

Selena Gomez is given the task of spewing technical jargon that is so far from her comfort zone, I busted a gut more than a few times listening to her attempt these lines. Ethan Hawke is one of my favourite character actors and he does the best he can with his limited material. The movie is brain-less as hell and the whole movie is literally saved by one inept policeman who can't shine a flashlight properly.

Then you get a movie like \"The Getaway\" where it is a 90 minute long car chase, and it just doesn't work.  It's a big mess actually.  Ethan Hawke stars as a driver who has to drive a car around a city doing a lot of crazy stuff that a mysterious voice on the phone(Jon Voight) is telling him to do, since he has kidnapped Hawke's wife.  Along the way Hawke picks up Selena Gomez and the 2 try to figure out how to save his wife, and why this is being done to him.  This is a bad movie.  The directing is horrible.  The edit job on this is one of the worst I've ever seen.  It goes back and forth from the regular camera to camera set up on the car to make it seem like a found footage type movie.  Hawke does good, as he always does, but Voight is completely wasted and Gomez is very miscast.  I saw just completely skip this and watch a \"fast and furious\" movie if you like fast cars.  If you want a good thriller involving a car, check out the original \"Hitcher\" or even \"Joy Ride\".  Otherwise you'll want to get away from \"The Getaway\"(lol, see how I did that:-p  )",

It's just a simple mindless action movie that gets your heart pounding. The general user rating on imdb gave this movie a 4.1/10. That's ridiculous, for me being into these kind of movies I thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes it is mindless action with a horrible plot to it. Guys wife gets kidnapped, guy gets revenge. Also there's a lot of useless car crashes in the film but that's also what I liked about it. The actors on the other hand....let's just say this wasn't their best roles. Ethan Hawke didn't really do anything wrong, I just think he under acted a little bit but other than that he did a great job. Selena Gomez.....well again she could've done better, she over acted a bit too much. Every time the car drifted it seemed like she couldn't control herself and what words came out of her mouth. Hon Voight, boy he really knew how to get you to not like him and at the end of the movie you actually seem him for a second and then he's gone and the movie ends, that kind of irritated me but hey it was a low budget film.  Anyway, the movie does have it's flaws but in the end it's a good action movie that I could watch more than twice. Highly recommended",

It has a few things that I like, I think Selena Gomez and Ethan Hawke play nicely off of each other, and some of the car footage is decent, but then again some of it is pretty terrible.  To give an example of how bad the getaway footage can get: the entire climactic chase scene is shot from the hood of Hawke's car, and the footage is noticeably sped up to make it look exciting.  What it winds up looking like is a deleted segment from Koyannisqatsi in which the cameraman must have gone to lunch because it remains in the same fixed position the entire time aiming at the villain's undercarriage.  It was laughably terrible, making the entire scene look about as convincing as someone scrolling through Google Earth.",

The story is about Brent Magna who is a former race car driver and he comes home one day to find his wife Leanne has been kidnapped, and in order to get her back he needs to do exactly as a voice on a phone tells him, which is drive a car really fast and crash into everything.The movie opens with a montage sequence that introduces us to the premise in less than five minutes, and looks like it was shot as the introduction to a T.V. show. The camera never stays still, cutting every three to five seconds. The close-ups and odd camera angles, coupled with the short cuts, come out to look very bad, the whole movie could take place in the same room and up and down the same stretch of road for all we know. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems like the whole movie's purpose is to make the audience think it is being wowed, from the story to the way the movie is presented. The cinematography and the editing are designed to work as an afterthought. With the camera angles being tight and the editing quick and choppy at best. When Magna is being chased by cops for driving through a crowded park and destroying an outdoor shopping bazaar, all we see is shaky shots of cars, Magna jerking the wheel, and a car flipping over while crashing into something. We aren't experiencing the thrill of the chase, the build-up to the crash is never given. And because of that, the movie is never exciting, thrilling, or tense. When the camera finally does take a moment to calm down and relax, it's to give the audience the best shot and sequence of the film. As Magna chases down a car the movie cuts to a single take from a camera planted on the very front of the car. The shot is quiet and the zigzagging in and out of traffic feels very real, but what feels like a build-up to something shocking and spectacular leads to nothing but a cutaway to the rest of the chase that ends in them simply stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGetaway seems like its just a hideous car wreck that keeps playing out over and over again, kicking off a new chase every few minutes to engage the \"excitement.\" If watching a demolition derby at Ludicrous Speed sounds fun to you, please understand this is still absolutely nothing like that. Just imagine trying to keep up with the drifts, skids, collisions, and explosions it can be overwhelming. You'll be interested for the first five minutes or so, but after that expect a huge sigh of regret once you realize those five minutes are going to be replayed for the remaining eighty five. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI actually like Selena Gomez, but she couldn't do anything to help the movie at all. Probably and most likely due to a weak script, the dialogue between her and Ethan Hawke got extremely boring and dull for most of the movie. I struggled to find any good points in the movie except the vehicle that Ethan Hawke drove during the film which was a mustang if I'm not mistaken. I wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone unless you're a major fan of \"car chases and getaways\" there would be an over abundance of that waiting for you.",

Granted its nothing I haven't seen before, it's very silly, absurd and I cant say it was very good but I've seen much worse movies that lasted 90 minutes, I never found myself bored or looking at my watch. The movie seemed to evaporate from my memory moments after I saw it and that's not an exaggeration, I wrote this review about 45 minutes after I saw it and I don't remember one line of dialogue, all I remember are car crashes, which I will admit that the effects looked like they hurt, when the cars hit something, it looked like it actually got hit. This movie did look pretty good, I like seeing things at night because its always more interesting to look at and the effects and explosions actually looked pretty good. The more I thought about this movie the less it made any sense and the plotholes started to seep through. There's also a really weird shot for about two minutes of one car behind another with no editing or music and just left me confused, what was the point? The editing thus far has been all over the place and suddenly for two minutes the editor just fell asleep? Who knows, who cares. There's also some really cheesy scenes, like some dude on a bike shooting at the car for about a minute and keeps missing, Ethan Hawke shoots one time and took him out no problem. It's silly, it's cheesy, I saw it coming but what the heck. Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez worked well enough, they shared some funny lines together and become partners in that old cliche way and I thought she was ideal casting, she played her part well, I've seen her in two movies this year and her characters were very distinct, she's not just a pretty face to attract teenage boys, she does a good job. With any movie like this you're intrigued enough to carry on watching to work out why the bad guy is doing what he's doing just so you can say ' oh, okay, I get it' but that ending was really poor and that's where more of the plotholes started to seep through. So I just took it for what it was, a very silly b action film. I watched it because I was intrigued to see why it was so bad but if I'm channel surfing one night and it's there, I'll put it on just because it's some easy entertainment. This movie was hardly bad, it just wasn't particularly unique. Take this for what its worth.",

            "content": "\"I am not going to die for you.\"\n\nThe title of director Courtney Solomon's film serves as a warning for us to getaway from this movie as fast as we can. If you haven't experienced this film then you are a very fortunate person because it is by far the worst film of the year. There are so many quick cuts and over 6000 edits (when your average film has far less than 2000) that your head just begins to feel like it's going to explode. Getaway is a mind numbing experience and a B-movie that you won't even find entertaining in a guilty pleasure sort of way. It is just one gigantic 90 minute car chase, where the main character is a Shelby Super Snake Mustang. The Mustang has more depth than any of the other characters in this film. Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez deserve a Razzie for their performance here. It's a shame that Hawke wasn't allowed to write the script because he would have done a much better job than Sean Finegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker. The dialogue between Hawke and Gomez was so painful that I couldn't believe one of the best films of this year also starred Hawke.  How I wish it was Delpy in that chair beside him instead of Selena Gomez, so that she could slap some sense into him. There is no reason he should have made this film (unless his wife was actually kidnapped and he was forced to star in this). \n\nThe plot is pretty simple since the entire film is just an excuse to see fast cars chasing this marvelous and invincible Shelby Mustang. Brent Magna (Ethan Hawke) is a former race car driver living in Bulgaria who arrives home one day to find that his wife (Rebecca Budig) has been kidnapped. He receives a phone call from a mysterious man (Jon Voight) telling him to do exactly what he says if he wants to get his wife back. He is forced to steal a specific Shelby Mustang that has been wired with microphones and cameras so that the mysterious man can see his every move. He then gives Brent several suicide missions during the course of one night causing havoc in the streets while at the same time trying not to get caught by the police. The owner of the car, who is only referenced as the kid (Selena Gomez), ends up being his only ally in this mission. If Brent wants to get his wife back, he must obey the voice's every demand. \n\nGetaway feels at times like a video game, with several different camera angles and far too many cuts. Which is probably the opposite effect that Solomon was looking for considering he didn't include any CGI shots and had every single scene shot with real cars and real crashes. It was an interesting premise to shoot everything like this, but he overdid it and forgot about any character development. I get bored pretty easily during long car chases, so you could imagine how I felt during this 90 minute never ending chase. I was so numb that I couldn't even fully appreciate one great scene near the end where we get a two minute unedited shot from the Mustang's point of view while chasing a van. That scene was really good and it deserved to be in a better movie. It is the only reason why I will give this film half a star. The rest of Getaway is completely forgettable. The editing in this film was a complete disaster and so were the numerous and senseless plot holes.",

Give me some popcorn and a Coke, and dim the lights, let me forget about the world for a couple hours, and I'm happy. Most of the plot was admittedly easy to figure out early on, but the movie still provided plenty of excitement in how it got there. There were some aspects of the story that were dismissed without explaining a lot of detail, but it didn't rely on otherwise smart people doing dumb things to make it all work, and I appreciated that as well. \nOverall, I enjoyed Getaway, but that may be in part because I went in with low expectations. The movie is what it is and if you know what you're getting into it shouldn't be that much of a letdown.\n\nGetaway is the gritty, exciting action thriller from Warner Brothers in which former race car driver Brent Magna is pitted against the clock as he commandeers a custom Shelby Super Snake Mustang, taking it and its unwitting owner on a high-speed adventure at the command of a mysterious villain on a race against time to save the life of his kidnapped wife.",

He discovers that his wife has been abducted as she was decorating for Christmas and he soon gets a phone call from a mysterious voice telling him to steal a special car in a certain parking garage and drive all over Sofia so that his wife will be saved ... all just because.  Magna finds the Shelby Cobra just waiting to be stolen ... and he steals it.  Once inside the car he finds out it has been wired with cameras and other video equipment that directly connects him to the mysterious voice to be fed directions ... just because.  Magna is soon car-jacked by a young woman (Selena Gomez - Spring Breakers) who claims that the car is hers ... and so refuses to exit the car even though it is clear her life is in peril.  Magna and the girl drive all over Sofia ... in one chase scene after another out-maneuvering cop after cop after cop after cop.  Again ... just because.  Jon Voight's (Ali) mouth co-stars as the voice as this is the only part of him we see throughout the entire movie.  Why has Magna's wife been taken?  Why has Magna been targeted?  How does the Voice know everything?  Why is the girl so dumb and so technologically intelligent at the same time?  Why does this film exist?  It is ALL one long chase ... even though it is broken down into smaller implausible bit after bit.  Saying it is dumber than a rubber tire is actually being rather nice.

Ethan Hawke is serviceable, but Selena Gomez is terrible. Every line she delivers feels like she's in a school play. The editing.... my god. This has to be one of the worst editing I've ever seen in a film, it cuts every second to multiple shots from drastically different angles and you have no idea what the hell is going on. The music is standard, no real problems, just generic. The direction is absolutely terrible, Courtney Solomon has absolutely no idea how to direct a chase scene.

            "content": "The biggest problem with Getaway was also likely its main selling point to gear heads: it's one long 90-minute car chase. That may sound like a good thing to audiences that love them some high-speed thrills, but back up a moment because this scenario could be like getting sick from eating too much ice cream. Car chases are one of the greatest things in movies, but they are still dependant upon execution and overall context within the narrative. If you got nothing but relentless car chases, wouldn't that start to get boring? And so it is with Getaway whose endless stream of car chases becomes one long, plodding, monotonous blur of tedium.\r\n\r\nBrent Magna (Ethan Hawke) is a former racecar driver looking for a fresh start in Bulgaria. One day he comes home, sees the Christmas decorations shattered, and is told that his wife has been kidnapped. The mysterious The Voice (Jon Voight in constant close-up) threatens to kill Brent's wife unless he plays along. As per his orders, Brent hops into an impressive stolen car, outfitted with cameras so The Voice can keep tabs. Brent is ordered to drive around the city wildly. At one point, The Kid (Selena Gomez) pulls a gun on him, claiming that the car belongs to her. She's forced inside the car and the two unlikely partners are made to do the bidding of The Voice.\r\n\r\nAnother major problem for the movie being stuck in neutral is that it's directed by Courtney Solomon, the man who previously helmed notorious stinkers like Dungeons and Dragons and An American Haunting. The action sequences are so badly edited together that often it's a collage of fast-paced imagery without feeling the impact. It's hard to tell what's going on much of the time, so you just give up. There is one extended uncut scene of high-speed driving, but ordinarily Getaway is replete with confusing quick-cuts. More so, Solomon has difficulty properly staging the action sequences to draw out tension, falling back on speedy resolutions and rote action tropes. He doesn't have a strong feel to visually orchestrate action. I cannot recall one action sequence that grabbed my attention, partly because they just run together into a flavorless meringue. The most annoying feature is Solomon placing a series of cameras all over the interior and exterior of Brent's car. The movie frequently cuts around these security camera POVs, which are visually unappealing and remind you of a lame reality TV competition show. I think the camera aspect was included to give a grander visceral aspect of the car chases, to put you in the middle of the action. However, isn't that the pint of a really good car chase anyway? Shouldn't proper execution make me feel thrills rather than dumb camera angles glommed onto the car? I would argue that Getaway might have been sold on the notion that the added Webcams make it \"found footage-y.\"\r\n\r\nThe scenes that aren't car chases end up becoming respites, something to strangely look forward to, and judging by the atrocious dialogue, this is not a positive. Another problem is that the car chases are all relatively the same. It's alleys, it's streets, sometimes ice rinks, but we're in Bulgaria and the particulars of the car chases will not budge. There is nothing to distinguish Car Chase #13 fro Car Chase #86, and so it all just becomes bland even with all the vehicular mayhem. The stunt work is certainly impressive but I just wish it had been put to far better use. \r\n\r\nThen there's the matter of the characters and plot, or rather, the complete lack of them. The movie doesn't waste any time, putting Brent in his muscle car and speeding around by minute two. I can almost respect that expediency, but it comes at a severe cost. All we know is that the guy drives good, which will be self-evident in seconds, and that his lovely wife was kidnapped by bad people who want him to drive. That's it. Naturally, having one dude in a car doesn't lead to great moments of characterization, and so we're given the plucky teenage misfit partner played by the absurdly miscast Gomez (Monte Carlo, Spring Breakers). This character is annoying from the start and played by an actress who cannot convincingly portray an edgy character. So she comes off as artificial and irritating. It's uncertain at this point whether Gomez can step outside her doe-eyed Disney Channel branding, but this awful movie certainly isn't helping. Being stuck in the car with these two terribly written characters is like being trapped on a long vacation with the relatives you hate. \r\n\r\nThe plot is about as simple as you could think, and then most of it fail to make much sense. The car belongs to The Kid. The bad guys want to hit up her dad's bank, stealing funds about to be liquidated, and then this all requires Brent to drive like a maniac throughout Bulgaria, where the country apparently hasn't invented helicopters yet to track speeding cars through the sky. The plot really is the thinnest tissue to get the movie from one loud car chase to the next, with some asides where Gomez can spit out a few adult profanities (no F-bombs kids, this is still PG-13 after all). The conclusion makes little sense (spoilers). In the end, the villainous Voice congratulates Brent and his sidekick for winning, vanquishing his greedy scheme. Okay, but the Mr. Voice goes one step further claiming that this was his plan all along, to push Brent to his full potential that he always knew he was capable of. What does this mean? This man staged a highly elaborate heist, hired men with fierce firepower, and installed all this fancy technology just to make Brent a more self-actualized individual? This ending clearly points to a conclusive lack of an ending. Once the car chases were over, the screenwriters looked at each other and said, \"Now what?\" and that was when they typed \"The end.\"\r\n\r\nI'm struggling to come up with any verifiable positives I can say about Getaway. I suppose if you're an auto aficionado, you'll get a kick out of watching Brent's car, a Shelby Super Snake Mustang (I readily admit to looking this up because I don't care about cars), in action. Other than that, unless you have a strong desire to watch Voight's mouth in extreme close-ups for 90 minutes (you know who you are), there really isn't anything of value to be found in the wreck that is Getaway.  \r\n\r\nIf you're a car chase junkie, I think taking a shot with Getaway could be the trick to sober you up. It's one long 90-minute car chase but made so ineptly, at every angle of filmmaking, that it gets so monotonous and boring far too early. When you don't have characters to keep your interest, a plot that makes sense, action sequences that offer some variety, editing that makes the action coherent, and direction that hamstrings the viewer to lousy dashboard-esque cameras, then it's easy to fall asleep to the sounds of near-constant vehicle crunching. Getaway is a terrible action movie, a terrible movie in general, and proof positive that action fans should be careful what they wish for.\r\n\r\nNate's Grade: D",

            "content": "Well good job, Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez! With one movie you've managed to make all of the good work you've done this year irrelevant. Hawke, coming off a sterling return to his indie roots with Before Midnight, plus a surprising horror smash in The Purge, slices his IQ and ours in half for the insipid sub WWE-level Getaway, a film with about a thousand car wrecks (not really exaggerating here) and still manages to be painfully dull. At least he's not the woefully miscast Gomez, playing a bad girl not totally unlike her role in the far superior Spring Breakers. But with her flat, robotic delivery someone might want to check her back for a pull string.\n\nWanting desperately to be Fast & Furious, Getaway is more like the schizophrenic cousin to 12 Rounds and all the awfulness that implies. To its credit, likely the only credit it will receive here, the film makes no bones about what it is or what kind of crap you're in store for. Torturously directed by F-lister Courtney Solomon, it begins with Hawke racing all over Bulgaria like a mad man, intercut with an incoherent flashback flurry that kind of tells us why. His wife has been kidnapped, the home wrecked (including their poor Christmas tree), and now he's being forced to race up and down the crowded streets at the command of some guy on the phone who sounds vaguely like Werner Herzog, or the villain from Lethal Weapon 2. If only it was Herzog, because that would be kind of awesome and disorienting like when he turned up in Jack Reacher, but instead it's just Jon Voight, who hasn't done anything meaningful since he bit Kramer's arm on Seinfeld.\n\nIn-between the dozens of car chases, all shot with ponderous incompetence that ensures you'll be bored within minutes, we learn that Hawke's character is the ridiculously-named Brent Magna, a former racing bad boy who \"washed out\" of the sport, and got in trouble with some criminal types. Why it takes him so long to figure out they might be the reason he's in this mess, when we've figured it out the very friggin' moment he says it, is a question that boggles the mind. After being instructed to pull into a parking garage, he gets carjacked by Disneyfied thug/computer hacker, who reveals the muscled Mustang he's driving actually belongs to her. Forced to take her along because the disembodied voice says so, it's clear that she's only there to give us something else to look at other than Hawke's glowering mug. Hawke has starred in a lot of really terrible movies in his career, but when he's checked out it is totally obvious. He couldn't look more disinterested than if he was tweeting mid-sentence, and Gomez doesn't help out much. To be fair, it's not like the \"writer\" had major plans for her, because she doesn't even have a name until about five minutes before the end credits.\n\nSo basically the entirety of the 90 minute run time, which feels somehow like 190 minutes, involves Hawke barreling through the streets chased by the world's most incompetent and unlawful cops ever. First of all, these keystone coppers never seem to show up until Magna is on his next \"test\", as if someone flips a switch and unleashes them into the city like marbles in a game of Hungry Hungry Hippos. And when they aren't causing just as much property damage (we're talkin' Man of Steel levels here), they're acting like clowns by repeatedly challenging Magna's vehicle which has the armor of a small tank. Motorcycle cops against a speeding tank? Hope they have a lot of empty space at the local morgue.\n\nA better director could have probably coaxed something interesting out of this relatively generic premise, at least giving us a competent single-location thriller with echoes of Phone Booth or Speed. Solomon, who gave us the embarrassing Dungeons & Dragons years ago, is not the filmmaker for the job, haphazardly editing every scene with a dizzying array of quick cuts and zoom ins/zoom outs, repeated ad nauseum until your stomach churns. The villain tracks Magna's every move through cameras set up along the inside of the car, which Solomon uses as an excuse to randomly jar us by switching to digital video for no apparent reason.\n\nThere does manage to be one really good scene during the end, and rather than spoiling it here it's best left to be discovered. You'll have no problem recognizing it; it's the one that looks nothing like the crap you've just been suffering through. There's a labored attempt to launch some sort of franchise, and despite how unsavory that notion might be the chances are Getaway will live on in cheaply produced straight-to-DVD sequels helmed by hacks.",

The plot, acting, location and car crash scenes were horrible.  I do not recommend this movie at all.  The trailer tricked me into thinking this would be an interesting car movie.  Selena Gomez was pretty useless in this movie, her acting was not good at all.  Ethan Hawke is a good actor, his acting wasn't any better in this movie!  The film did not offer any suspense at all, it felt very bland and predictable.  You knew what was going to happen!",

            "content": "Let me give you a few shocking statistics of the movie Getaway before I Review it.\n 134 vehicles were destroyed were making in this movie. So many were wrecked that, after just the first month of filming, a special \"Getaway\" junkyard had to be built near the set.\n 13 Shelby GT500 Super Snake Mustangs, worth a total of $1.23 million, were wrecked in the making of the movie \"Getaway\".\n 45 Cars Rolled Over in the car-action scenes of the movie.\n Director Courtney Solomon's claimed that no CGI was used in the crash scenes.\nFacts regarding the Shelby American Car in Getaway:\nShelby American, which creates the limited-edition special-order $94,195 Super Snake from stock Shelby GT500 Ford Mustangs, built seven complete and identical Super Snakes for the film. The cars were then shipped from Shelby's facility in Las Vegas to Sofia, Bulgaria, where all of the shooting for the movie was done. Stunt coordinators said many of the seven were wrecked multiple times. Re-usable parts were scavenged from the wrecks and bolted together to build new versions. It was calculated that, in all, the seven original cars were eventually re-purposed into 13 different Shelbys over the course of making the whole film.\nSo what is Getaway all about?\n'Getaway\" may star Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez, but the car in this relentless action thriller - a Shelby GT500 Super Snake - should get equal billing. Hawke portrays Brent Magna, a former racecar driver who spends nearly the entire film racing this powerful built-to-order Mustang through the streets of Sofia, Bulgaria, on a wild goose chase to save his kidnapped wife.\nWhy did it still turn out to be the Worst Movie of the Century?\n1. The Entire movie revolves around only one thing - Ethan being chased left, right and center\n2. The action begins the second movie starts - It seriously makes no sense. There is no characterization, there is not storyline, there is not introduction - Immediately the audience is taken into the action scene.\n3. The Entire Sofia Police Force and I mean Entire Police Force - with 135 cars chase him one by one but they all get destroyed - except the hero's car. Surprising I must add!\n4. Within the 1st 3 minutes you start getting irritated with why the Villain wants Ethan to kill every man, woman and child walking peacefully on the road instead of focusing on a task at hand.\n5. Selena Gomez as it turns out is the most irritating & odd character in the whole movie. This Chubby kid with Pouty Lips would not know how to act even if he life depended on it. In fact, right off the bad, I wished she were killed in the movie. Her character makes no sense and she does not look nor play her part at all. In fact one begins to wonder what strings did she pull or what favors did she do to even get a part in the movie?\n6. The Plot is totally senseless and the way the characters have been introduced is also totally ridiculous.\n7. The Actors borderline between over-acting (Ethan) to not know how to act at all (Selena).\n8. The Chemistry between both the actors is a big joke.\n9. After watching around 25 car crashes - it all becomes mind-numbing. Seriously....How many chase scenes and car crashes (they do all start to look alike) can one person take.\n10. Did I also tell you there is no sense in the storyline? The biggest joke of it all is how a tech-savvy hardcore mind - who spend millions, has his expertise with the best of the best, has engineered the most elaborate scheme in the world that too with all the resources at hand with the latest technology - is outsmarted by a Small Girl using just an iPad, Cell-Phone and Internet Connection -. Yeah Right!\nOverall, one of the most ridiculous movies of the century. I couldn't believe it that such a terrible movie could be created - In fact I even wonder what are the actors thinking after watching such a movie. Director Courtney Solomon who pathetic record has movies like An American Haunting (12% rating on Rottentomatoes.com) and Dungeons & Dragons (10% rating on Rottentomatoes.com), along with Selena Gomez & Ethan has quite frankly destroyed their careers with this movie - for good.\nOverall Rating\nMinus 10 out of 10\nLoy Machedo\nloymachedo dot com\nwhoisloymachedo dot com",

Because the voice of Jon Voight on a phone told him to. Why is that? Because the voice of Jon Voight needs something and has Brent's wife being held hostage so that he gets it. So off Brent goes, winding  his way through Sofia park during Christmas as shoppers run for cover and police try to catche up because sure why not. Then Selena Gomez, decked out in a hoodie, attempts to steal the car at gunpoint, presumably only because the script tells her to and nothing more. And she calls everyone asshole. She may as well be talking about the movie which goes on for a punishing 89 minutes that move like molasses. By the end your brain may have melted. Worst of summer, maybe the year.",

This movie had the potential to do something good with this material, as long as it was Ethan Hawke being the only person in the car. Casting  Selena Gomez, no offense, proved to be a misguided move on the studios part in an effort to attract a younger demographic, thus undermining what the story could've been. Its just painful to watch a person trying so hard to act, but fails so bad, it comes across as annoying and almost (teetering on completely) unwatchable. Compounded by the casting problem (among other things), the movie felt like it was made up as they went along. Were the filmmakers that desperate in fusing movies like Nick of Time, Long Kiss Goodnight, Drive and Speed? This was an incoherent mess and deserved a release on Redbox, not a theatrical exhibition.

            "content": "Getaway is one of those movies where a good guy must follow a bad guy's instructions in order to save his captured wife.  This one pretty much takes place entirely in a car.  Ethan Hawke stars as the husband, and the movie starts off right away with him being told to break into a car where he will receive further orders.\nOf course, there's a reason for why the villain is doing this.  And we only see glimpses of him throughout the movie.  There are close-ups of his mouth as he speaks in addition to various camera angles from behind, kind of like the bad guy from the Inspector Gadget cartoons.  He's even got a foreign accent just to add more menace to the character.  Ethan Hawke's character, Brent, is a former racecar driver.  This is why he's chosen to complete the tasks that the villain needs to be done.  But really that's also just another ploy so that the movie can be filled with slick car chases and a fast-paced feel.\nNot far into the movie, an additional character is thrown in to the mix.  She's a \"kid\" who jumps into the car sticking a gun in Brent's face, and is played by Selena Gomez.  The villain demands that she stays in the car as well since she discovers what's going on.  This obviously leads the two characters to team up and kind of join forces in preventing the villain from killing the abducted wife.    And as the movie goes on, it just becomes more and more far-fetched and ridiculous.  The kid winds up being extremely tech-savvy and at some points even seems smarter than Ethan Hawke's character.  The casting of Selena Gomez in this role is easily the worst casting I can think of in a while.  Having a 20 year-old girl who still looks 12 play this role makes it impossible to believe her as this witty and tough individual who doesn't seem afraid of anything.  \nThe movie could have been a fun ride otherwise, and the speeding car scenes are actually shot very well.  But it just veers a little too far into implausible territory.  It certainly feels like Ethan Hawke was slumming it in this flick; he probably just needed a decent payday.  But the movie hasn't fared well so far so I'm sure he's regretting it now.",

Seriously! Almost everything in this movie was done wrong, the writing, the direction, the acting, the story, the editing, the action, the score and the pacing, it was all a mess. It should come to no shock that this film sucked because let's face it when you put director, Courtney Solomon in the directing chair you get this stupid movie or Dungeons & Dragons. Yes, it's very sad to see Ethan Hawke play in this crapfest of a movie, but it was his choice and I still like his acting, but in this movie he was no good. He, of course wasn't the worst actor in the film, no! That had to go to Selena Gomez. When I first saw the previous for this movie, I thought \"what is Selena Gomez doing in a movie like this.\" Like most people I'm not a fan of Selena Gomez, so I knew just as well that she would be terrible in this movie, but shockingly! I didn't think she would be this terrible. Her performance was awful, but her chemistry with Ethan Hawke was just embarrassing. There suppose to be partners and I guess it's suppose to be kind of funny because she's a young girl, but it's not funny and it's not really clever either. Like I said in the beginning though, the acting was only one thing, this movie had so many other problems. The direction in this film was a complete mess, the camera angles looked like crap, the characters weren't developed and the plot wasn't very coherent. That also comes from bad writing, wow! The writing was just horrible. Again the characters weren't developed, you had no idea who they were and you didn't give a shit about them. The dialogue was also very sloppy, very clich√©d and really boring. The editing was also all over the place, it's like they couldn't stay on a single shot for five seconds. The score was also really lame, I felt like the music didn't match the tone of the film, which is what the score should do. So the writing is bad, the direction is a mess, the acting is a joke, the editing is too fast and the score is lame, so what else can you do to screw this movie up even more? That's right, let's have terrible action sequences! You got to be kidding me! This is an action film; the one thing it could at least do right is have cool action scenes, not horribly executed car crashes, lame explosions and boring chases. Yes! Most of this movie takes place in a car, so you don't have much to work with, but you can still make awesome action sequences, if Drive and The Transporter can do it, then I think this film could have done it. What else can I say! This film did everything wrong. A few movies this year probably pissed me off more, but I think this movie had the most flaws, which is pretty bad because there have been some stickers this year. I, of course don't recommend this movie to anyone I don't care who you are stay away from this movie.",

It sounds like all involved want this engaging premise to get Taken to the bank...only the hard-driving twist on this formula only goes so far.

Ethan Hawke is no Liam Neeson in that that he's not a 60-ish action hero.

Solomon could hardly even be considered a player at all in the action genre as he's only made three films and the first was 2000's Dungeons & Dragons adaptation that I never saw because I was both too young to care about it at the time and would have likely been massively confused if I had. I never played the game and the current 10% tomatometer score doesn't bode well for it either, but what really put the anticipation in the can for Getaway was knowing that Solomon also directed 2005's An American Haunting. I remember taking a date to that film and apologizing for how bad it turned out to be because it was my idea to go see it. With this third feature the director has made one of those films where all of the action revolves around a certain set of people locked into one location. This certainly might make things easier from a production standpoint as you don't have to deal with a ton of location scouting or all of the dynamics that go into orchestrating a production with a large cast involved, but when your location of confinement is on wheels there seems a much more complex scheme to choreograph and Getaway never seems to take advantage of its circumstances other than to feed us corny dialogue and messily shot action sequences that seem more thrown together than thought out. To be honest, there wasn't much expectation going into the film, but when you have such a simple premise and what seems to be outlandish execution paired with the fact that actors with the caliber of Ethan Hawke and the rising star of Selena Gomez presumably seeing something in the project you hope it might prove to be a fun, if not distracting experience. And yet, there isn't even an intentionally campy vibe to the project as it, for all intents and purposes, is as serious as a heart attack and with that tone does little to add fun to the predictable and lacking story that can't even sustain the brief hour and a half running time.  \n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

That is until you ate more then that and got a serious stomach ache.  Too much of something,  can do that to you can't it?  Such is the case with the plot-less, meaning-less and point-less movie Getaway.  I wasn't going to go see this garbage accept maybe at the $3 theater, but when I went to the $3 theater to see another movie and the line was all the way down the dad-gum street, I went to the new theater to check out a different movie then Getaway but it wasn't playing any longer.  So Getaway it was, and I certainly couldn't wait to get away when it was over.  This movie is exactly 90 minutes long.  No kidding when I say 70 minutes of it are car chases.  How many different ways can you wreck a hapless wee-ooo siren blazing European police car?  Apparently, about a hundred!  However, I grew tired of that quickly.  There is just simply no substance to this thing.  When Selena Gomez is the voice of reason (yes that girl you see on Disney Channel's stupid shows), you know you are in trouble.  Also, who wants to see a tight shot of Jon Voigt's mouth for 90 freaking minutes?  The guys doesn't even have that nice of teeth!  Ethan Hawke has done two bombs since his resurgence in Sinister, but now I begin to wonder what that guy is thinking.  Here's the deal.  I give this thing one star because of a two minute long, non-cutaway shot (after nothing but quick edits) toward the end during a chase scene, and kind of a cool ending that wasn't total sellout.  So watch the last 5 minutes of this garbage and you'll see enough.",

His venture into the realm of horror was great but this off-the-walls action flick just didn't work. Before you start questioning if my opinion of Ethan Hawke has changed, the answer is no. Ethan Hawke is still a great actor it was the directing and the script that was so pathetic that it made this decent idea into a totally incoherent, instantly forgettable, total crap fest. I will admit, a lot of the blending of certain scenes was nicely done and the last chase scene was beautiful but everything in between was terrible. Some of the action bits were cool but the movie needed a lot more help that better action. \n\nAs for the acting, it was pretty good. Selena Gomez has proved to me that she doesn't deserve to play characters who do nothing but yell 3 and 4 letter curse words. She is much better than that. Some of the best scenes were with Rebecca Budig, a soap star who is most famous for her role on All My Children. She proved that she could act but since this movie wasn't a drama, her acting ability was unfairly overlooked. Ethan Hawke was very good, for what he had to work with. In the simplest scene when any typical action star wouldn't show emotion, Ethan Hawke showed a good amount of emotion. He tried to pick up the pieces of this terrible movie but unfortunately everything about this movie is a waste of time. Definitely not worth to see it in theaters.",

Certain goons in the movie had UNLIMITED bullets and didn't hit anything yet when Brent Magna shot ONE shot from a 9mm pistol and blew up EVERYTHING. I need that gun one time. \n\nOver all it was a good movie and I don't expect for movies to be true to life but some things were just down right disrespectful to my powers of observation.",

            "content": "It has become painfully evident that the majority of musicians don't typically make for good actors - and many of them (with aspirations of taking Hollywood by storm) might want to rethink any sudden urge to start an acting career even before they start.  Clearly, there are several exceptions to that particular claim, since there have obviously been multiple success stories, including Will Smith, Mark Wahlberg, and Justin Timberlake.  But, just because certain musicians have the talent to make a \"hit\" record doesn't automatically qualify them for A-list stardom outside the world of music.  After all, most of Hollywood's top names had to work their way up through acting school before hitting the big time - so it's not really fair to them when musical talents, like Vanessa Hudgens, Julianne Hough, and Selena Gomez snatch starring roles in feature films.  In fact, it's a downright travesty and it's painfully evident in the new thriller, Getaway - starring Selena Gomez.\n\nDirected by Courtney Solomon (Dungeons & Dragons), Getaway stars Ethan Hawke as Brent Magna - a former professional racecar driver that is forced into an evening of crime behind-the-wheel after his wife, Leanne (Rebecca Budig), is kidnapped.  Brent is contacted via phone by a mysterious voice (Jon Voight) that is holding his wife captive, and if Brent doesn't do exactly what he says - she will die.  Brent is given a decked out car, which contains several cameras inside and out to make sure he carries out a set of missions.  However, he takes on an unexpected passenger (Selena Gomez) along the way and is begrudgingly forced to work with the tech-savvy girl.\n\nThe clear-cut star of this film is not Ethan Hawke or Selena Gomez, but the sweet-looking Shelby Cobra Mustang.  Within the opening moments of the film, the paint job takes a pretty moderate beating and from that moment on, the film falls into a repetitive cycle of showing the exact same car chase sequence over and over.  For roughly an hour and a half, there's very little meaningful dialogue and a near endless amount of havoc and car wrecks.  At certain points during these chase scenes, the cut scenes become so distracting and borderline irritating to watch that it wouldn't be surprising in the least to hear viewers complaining about a headache when they walk out of the theater.  Yes, it's really that bad - and there's no one other than the director to blame for something like that. \n\nI'll openly admit that Ethan Hawke is one of my favorite actors to watch.  In films, like Training Day, Great Expectations and Before Sunrise, he's nothing short of a pleasure to watch.  He has an absolute flare for the dramatic, but he always seems to fall short in action flicks - like Assault on Precinct 13, Lords of War, and definitely Getaway.  It's not fair to blame this film's blunders on his shoulders, since he essentially sits behind the wheel of a car for an entire film, occasionally spewing generic dialogue and trying to convince an audience that a young girl knows more about the world than he does.  This was a complete and total misuse of a talented actor, and this film would have surely been more interesting if Justin Bieber were in the driver's seat as opposed to an actor that's been nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nFor someone as young and as talented as Selena Gomez, it's shame she had to take part in this film and open herself up to the relentless criticism for such a poorly written character.  Not only is it a poorly written character with a weak back story and an absolute lack of substance - she doesn't even have a name in the film.  Sadly, there's very little doubt that any other young actress would have brought more to this role than Gomez.  But, she's not alone in the blame department.  A lack of substance is also the best way to describe the film's villain, portrayed by the normally brilliant Jon Voight.  His voice is very distinctive from the very beginning, and it becomes increasing tedious as he constantly repeats the same lines over and over again.  Plus, it didn't really make a whole lot of sense for this film to make a huge deal out of revealing who the villain turns out to be.  Once again, this is another case of an actor's talents being completely wasted.\n\nThe poor acting performances all go back to the terrible plot and even worse dialogue.  At no point over the course of this movie are any real motives given for why this film is even taking place.  It completely reeks of trying to be a new, slightly altered version of Taken.  Apparently, since Hawke's character used to be somewhat of a famous racecar driver, he should be an easy target for blackmail.  The motive of the villain is nearly nonexistent, other than he used to be a big fan and likes money.  And, let's not forget that there's nothing realistic about this film to begin with, either, including one drivers shocking awesome ability to completely avoid an entire legion of police cars.  You'd also assume that after all the driving he does, he would need to fill up his tank with some gas or get a flat tire from running over random things.  If only the cops were smart enough to just shoot his tires, especially since \"the girl\" took the time to point out that they can do that.  In the end, when all else fails, just wait for the young, tech savvy girl to work her magic and figure everything out. \n\nIf you haven't heard, Getaway has already been labeled as one of the worst films of the summer - and the year.  And, while this film certainly does have a massive amount of flaws, it's not necessarily as bad as it's made out to be.  Without a shadow of a doubt, this is a far cry from a good movie, but there are still far worst movies to watch.  Still, there's no point in debating that Selena Gomez is one of the reasons this film suffers mightily, but it's also due largely to the poor script, miserable directing, and lack of substance.  This film had a great deal of potential, attempting to combine Fast & Furious with Taken, but the experience massively fails from poor execution.  If this film were redone using a quality director and an experience Hollywood actress, this film could have been so much better.  Feel free to wait for a desperate Friday or Saturday night at home to give this film any of your attention.\n\nGRADE:  D-",

The storyline is solid and the acting is surprisingly good. You won't be able to fault this movie there.\n\nIt's not a special movie you're going to remember for the rest of your life, but if you're an action fan, or a fan of the actors, or of Mustang Shelby Cobras, this movie is still definitely worth your time. In the end, my only complaint about this movie is that it was too short. I would go see it again at full ticket price.\n\n(and to answer the suspicions, YES. Selena Gomez's character is actually important to the story. I had my doubts as well, but no, she wasn't added just for star power).",

Cop car = push it sideways until an obstacle appears which the cop car hits. Need to hide = use ramp/stairs.... Seriously. Just to add insult to the audience... Selena Gomez's character points out two of the biggest plot holes. First, this guy has no idea if his wife is alive or not.

He clearly starts with an IPhone in the beginning left by Jon Voights character but then when he gets out of the car he has a completely different phone that is very cheap looking.\n2. The car had way too much stuff in it that was really not explained. There was an XBox controller in the driver door.\n3. They blew up the power plant that they said was for the whole city, saw the power go out in the city but then when they started running from the cops again the whole city still has lights.\n4. The car lost a side mirror in front of the camera because of a tight spot the car just came out of and then in the next shot it reappears.\n5. She somehow hacks into Jon Voights camera system that was installed in the car to survey their driving with her IPad and then loops a video of them sitting still to throw him off. How? Plus he can hear everything they are saying because of the microphone but couldn't hear her devise a plan to fool him in this case or the next.\n6. The last chase scene was so long and drawn out for cool effects but was still just dumb because Ethan was in a Shelby Mustang but couldnt catch up to a stock van though he was always 15 feet away from the bumper. \nThe last thing wrong with this is that the whole thing was devised by Jon Voight who turned out to be a fan who put him through all of that just because he wanted Ethan to regain his confidence as a driver and also gets away with the money they helped him steal.

Hawke, coming off a sterling return to his indie roots with Before Midnight, plus a surprising horror smash in The Purge, slices his IQ and ours in half for the insipid sub WWE-level Getaway, a film with about a thousand car wrecks (not really exaggerating here) and still manages to be painfully dull. At least he's not the woefully miscast Gomez, playing a bad girl not totally unlike her role in the far superior Spring Breakers. But with her flat, robotic delivery someone might want to check her back for a pull string.\n\n \n\nWanting desperately to be Fast & Furious, Getaway is more like the schizophrenic cousin to 12 Rounds and all the awfulness that implies. To its credit, likely the only credit it will receive here, the film makes no bones about what it is or what kind of crap you're in store for. Torturously directed by F-lister Courtney Solomon, it begins with Hawke racing all over Bulgaria like a mad man, intercut with an incoherent flashback flurry that kind of tells us why. His wife has been kidnapped, the home wrecked (including their poor Christmas tree), and now he's being forced to race up and down the crowded streets at the command of some guy on the phone who sounds vaguely like Werner Herzog, or the villain from Lethal Weapon 2. If only it was Herzog, because that would be kind of awesome and disorienting like when he turned up in Jack Reacher, but instead it's just Jon Voight, who hasn't done anything meaningful since he bit Kramer's arm on Seinfeld.\n\n \n\nIn-between the dozens of car chases, all shot with ponderous incompetence that ensures you'll be bored within minutes, we learn that Hawke's character is the ridiculously-named Brent Magma, a former racing bad boy who \"washed out\" of the sport, and got in trouble with some criminal types. Why it takes him so long to figure out they might be the reason he's in this mess, when we've figured it out the very friggin' moment he says it, is a question that boggles the mind. After being instructed to pull into a parking garage, he gets carjacked by Disneyfied thug/computer hacker, who reveals the muscled Mustang he's driving actually belongs to her. Forced to take her along because the disembodied voice says so, it's clear that she's only there to give us something else to look at other than Hawke's glowering mug. Hawke has starred in a lot of really terrible movies in his career, but when he's checked out it is totally obvious. He couldn't look more disinterested than if he was tweeting mid-sentence, and Gomez doesn't help out much. To be fair, it's not like the \"writer\" had major plans for her, because she doesn't even have a name until about five minutes before the end credits.\n\n \n\nSo basically the entirety of the 90 minute run time, which feels somehow like 190 minutes, involves Hawke barreling through the streets chased by the world's most incompetent and unlawful cops ever. First of all, these keystone coppers never seem to show up until Magma is on his next \"test\", as if someone flips a switch and unleashes them into the city like marbles in a game of Hungry Hungry Hippos. And when they aren't causing just as much property damage (we're talkin' Man of Steel levels here), they're acting like clowns by repeatedly challenging Magma's vehicle which has the armor of a small tank. Motorcycle cops against a speeding tank? Hope they have a lot of empty space at the local morgue. \n\n \n\nA better director could have probably coaxed something interesting out of this relatively generic premise, at least giving us a competent single-location thriller with echoes of Phone Booth or Speed. Solomon, who gave us the embarrassing Dungeons & Dragons years ago, is not the filmmaker for the job, haphazardly editing every scene with a dizzying array of quick cuts and zoom ins/zoom outs, repeated ad nauseum until your stomach churns. The villain tracks Magma's every move through cameras set up along the inside of the car, which Solomon uses as an excuse to randomly jar us by switching to digital video for no apparent reason.\n\n \n\nThere does manage to be one really good scene during the end, and rather than spoiling it here it's best left to be discovered. You'll have no problem recognizing it; it's the one that looks nothing like the crap you've just been suffering through. There's a labored attempt to launch some sort of franchise, and despite how unsavory that notion might be the chances are Getaway will live on in cheaply produced straight-to-DVD sequels helmed by hacks.",

Unfortunately not in the case of Getaway, which instead slaughters the idea so poorly you can't help but feel sorry for it.¬†\n\nEveryone loves a good car chase. You won't find one in Getaway though. All the chase scenes are nothing more than a nauseating rapid succession of very brief cuts. It's literally ¬†impossible to get a wider picture and understanding of what is going. Many scenes could have been quite impressive if they had just been shot at a wider angle and held a longer frame. This does not happen once though. The breakneck speed at which the cuts are made (close up of bonnet-exploding box-back wheel-driver-back to bonnet) just doesn't allow the chase to flow and is frustrating to watch. How can one appreciate what's happening when they can't see what's happening?\n\nSelena Gomez may be trying to break out of her Disney image (and good for her) but that doesn't mean she's suited to every role. Her performance here feels weak and definitely isn't helped by an even weaker dialogue. Ethan Hawke's performance is more believable, but it's only one tastebud of sweetness in the overall bad taste this movie leaves.¬†\n\nThere's pretty much zero laughs, the first half is filled with the characters bickering annoyingly, the chase scenes are visually unwatchable, it's painfully unnecessarily noisy and the plot is nothing but mediocre.¬†\n\nFortunately I viewed the film at an advance screening and therefore given it was free I just felt disappointed, rather than feeling ripped off as I would have had I actually handed over my hard earned dollars in exchange for that mess.¬†I tried my best to enjoy the film, but to be honest all I wanted to do was getaway.",

The entire movie consists of about 5 minutes of dialog followed by 10 minutes of running away from the cops (repeated about 20 times). You see about half or more of the movie through the cameras the bad guy attached to the car to keep an eye on the good guy, and I wasn't sure if I was in a movie theater, or watching a bootleg. I'm not 100% sure why, but my favorite scene was a single shot that lasted 2-3 minutes of the good guy chasing the bad guy towards the end. I think it was because it was refreshing to have a little simplicity after so much nausea-inducing quick scene changes.

            "content": "Fun Fact: When the \"Need For Speed\" movie was in the editing room, there were many scenes being cut that, conveniently, didn't reveal any of the characters in the movie. The studio found out and said they had spent so much on filming the scenes they didn't want to let it go to waste, so they decided to get actors for dialogue and close ups and edit discarded Need For Speed clips into a new movie. Getaway is the product of that thought process, Getaway is that new movie.\n\nOk, so obviously none of that was true, but once you see this movie it makes sense. It would also explain why the same Silver and Blue Mustang are in both movies.\n\nEthan Hawke stars as a former race car driver who, after other complications alluded to but never really explained, has left the sport to spend time with his wife. He is quickly thrown into a series of tasks by a villain(Jon Voight), who's physical identity is unknown, that kidnapped his wife, again with zero explanation given in the movie. Soon he runs into Selena Gomez, the recently cut off hacker/tech genius daughter of a wealthy investment banker and it is an all out police chase as Hawke attempts to get to and save his wife as a reluctant Gomez accompanies him attempting to figure out the villains motives. \n\nThe movie was essentially one 90 minute long non-sensical chase scene. With many inconsistencies in logic, physics, and editing the movie passed the point of humorously bad and made a beeline for infuriatingly bad. Selena Gomez was ridiculously miscast, nothing against her personally, but I couldn't buy her as a gun totting \"gangsta\" when she first appeared nor could I buy her as a genius computer hacker, and that as a whole threw her acting off. As for Ethan Hawke, he has an incredible amount of talent, he's even gotten to showcase it this year (Before Midnight), and I don't know if it was the script, the directing, or his counterpart being miscast or what, but he too was far from bringing his A-game.\n\nThe ending of the movie...or rather lack there of, was clearly done in hopes of a sequel getting made. Luckily, with a box office take of 10 million dollars, that isn't likely to happen now, even as a direct to DVD movie, because I wasn't interested enough to care about anything happening (entirely the acting, and script's faults) to watch a sequel to get answers that should have been included in this movie.\n\nTo say I can't recommend this movie would be an understatement, a movie like this is something I would expect to be able to go into knowing it would be a fun movie to watch when working on other stuff, but this isn't even that.",

Hollywood style. \n\nI just couldn't buy into the chemistry between Ethan and Selena.\n\nIt seemed like the flick was written for Selena, with Ethan supporting her. He held back to give her some shine or something. She did well, mind you, and I think she'll get better. She's just not there yet.",

Thats pretty much as deep as it goes and has attracted decent names in Ethan Hawke, Sleena Gomez and Jon Voight to fill out the cast. Even though it is a low budget picture, it is a little too slickly produced to quantify as a grindhouse and almost a little too serious to be totally fun, but some of the angles they were able to get with cheap cameras were pretty cool.

The makers of \"Getaway\" must have thought: \"Hey guys, You know what's better than a 5-minute car chase? A 89-minute car chase movie! It will be much cooler than \"Drive\".\" Let me tell you something, \"Drive\" had style, plot and characters, \"Getaway\" has none of that. \"Getaway\" is barely even a movie, It's like watching a kid playing with his \"Hot Wheels\" toy cars for 89 minutes.\n\n\"Getaway\" is essentially \"Speed\" crossed with \"Taken\", \"Fast & Furious\" and \"12 Rounds\". How did \"Getaway\" managed to get the attraction of a hot music sensation and one of the leads from \"Before Midnight\"?\n\"Getaway\" stars Ethan Hawke as Brent Magna, a former race car driver who comes home to find Christmas ornaments crunch under his feet, the tree toppled, blood stains on the floor and his wife (Rebecca Budig) missing. Brent suddenly gets a call from a mysterious voice (Jon Voight) and the voice orders Brent to go steal a Super Snake Shelby Mustang (filled with GoPro cameras) and follow his instructions if not his wife dies.\n\n\"Getaway\" automatically turns into \"Speed 3: Mayhem in Bulgaria\" as the voice orders Brent to drive through some people, a skating rink, a water truck and getaway from the police. Soon, Brent gets carjacked by a young woman (Selena Gomez) claiming that the Shelby Mustang belongs to her, she holds Brent at gunpoint and then she gets stuck along the ride too. This young girl is no ordinary girl, she wears a baseball cap and a hoodie, she's a world class computer hacker with the ability to hack into the city's police server with some video she shoots on her phone and a few taps on the iPad she keeps in the glove compartment of her Mustang.\n\nMost of the action in \"Getaway\" is the same thing over and over again, cars get smashed (most of them police) and even though the Mustang gets scratched it doesn't seem to take any damage from all of that wreckage. Another question, After the Mustang causes damage to several city blocks and getting chased all over the city by Bulgarian police, Why doesn't the car run out of gas?\n\nWho is this young American computer hacker? Well, she's the daughter of a wealthy investment banker and we never know who her real name is. There could have been some real chemistry between the computer hacker and Brent Magna but their exchanges are downright laughable and they are just annoying. I bet that debuting screenwriters Sean Finegan and Gregg Maxwell Parker didn't even care to create characters or a plot that made sense.\n\nHow could Ethan Hawke not smell the script as bad? What exactly drove him into making this? Why didn't he re-write this mess? Ethan Hawke is not only an actor but a screenwriter as well, he co-wrote \"Before Sunset\" and \"Before Midnight\" for Director Richard Linklater. Ethan Hawke is still a great actor. As long as he continues to make great movies like \"Training Day\", \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead\" and of course, Richard Linklater's \"Before Sunrise\" trliogy, I can forgive him doing paycheck movies like \"The Purge\" and \"Assault on Precinct 13\".\n\nAfter a promising start to her film career with the cult hit \"Spring Breakers\", Selena Gomez takes a giant leap backward playing one of the most annoying female characters in movie history. She's so awful she makes Channing Tatum believable as a John McClane wannabe trying to save the president of the United States. Then there's the sad case of former Oscar winner Jon Voight, the estranged father of Angelina Jolie hasn't cared much about the status of his career lately, all he cares about now is big paychecks and supporting his fellow Republican constituents. There was a time when Voight was once a great actor but now that time is gone. Just when you think his career trajectory couldn't get any lower after \"BRATZ\", \"An American Carol\", \"September Dawn\" and not to mention \"SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2\" here's full evidence why he hasn't yet reached rock bottom. Voight can argue that he was only doing voice work for the film after all for most of the movie you can only hear his voice (his fake Eastern European accent) and see his mouth.\n\nThe villain in \"Getaway\" is a downright cardboard cutout. I didn't get what his motivation is or why he wanted to cause of this destruction in Bulgaria. After Brent Magna destroys about 90% of the Bulgarian police department's vehicles, The Voice gives Brent one more task before he can see his wife again, to rob the bank owned by the computer hacker's father. The armored Shelby Mustang seems to survive everything, despite being riddled with dozens of bullets, the bad guys just can't seem to take down the  Mustang.\n\nDirector Courtney Solomon's (Dungeons & Dragons and An American Haunting) car chase thriller makes absolutely no sense and it is so filled quick cuts and choppy editing, it makes us hard to tell what's happening on the screen. I don't mind a big dumb action movie, it's just that this one is so unbelievably dumb. This movie can't even get the performance of the car right. \"Getaway\" is not only another addition to my list for the worst movies of 2013, it's also by far the dumbest action movie since \"Ballistic: Ecks VS. Sever\".",

Until a young hacker (Selena Gomez) tries to steal the getaway car and being forced into an uneventful night. \n\nThere is not really much of a story as it jumps right into action with brief moments of Magna's wife being kidnapped and him getting into the car, driving away with a police chase. The movie is one big chase sequences, and it does get very repetitive. Even, the action sequence was not really exciting. It is badly edited and put together with many camera shots. All of those shots were jumbled into one big wreck. The director of photography also had most of the action sequences with terrible camera set-ups. Especially, there is one prolonging shot with the camera set up in front of the car as it chases another car, looking like it was one of those police chases that are seen on tv. \n\nEthan Hawke tried his best and gave much more of a performance than anyone else. Selena Gomez is a talented young actress but her playing a hacker. It felt miscasted with her in the role but props for her in trying. Jon Voight's performance as the mysterious voice and antagonist was not really a good one either. Even, if he was behind the other end of the phone line and in front of a computer looking through video feeds of Magna being chased around. \n\nGetaway does try to play out as a nonstop thrill ride with its everlasting action.

Basically, the movie is just one long chase scene with a few breaks for pointless dialogue.  There is no depth to the characters and the story is really lame.  Ethan Hawke plays a former race car driver who has to steal a car and follow instructions from a mostly unseen villain in order to save his wife.  Throw Selena Gomez into the mix, who may or may not have something to do with the villain's true motives, and you have a poorly acted, sorry excuse for a \"film\".  The central gimmick of the movie is that the car is fitted with a bunch of cameras, which means that you get a bunch of weird camera angles and HD video-looking (read: poor quality) photography from all sorts of video/surveillance feeds.  Not only that, but it's edited very haphazardly (shots are never held for more than a couple of seconds) and the space in which the action takes place is never clearly defined.  Then there's the villains, which are your standard cliche Eastern European villains, the chief one played by Jon Voight and whose face is never shown in its entirety (ashamed, maybe?).  Not only that, but this movie was shot on the cheap in Bulgaria, and it shows.  Overall, there's nothing at all good about this film, save for a single song: Jingle Bell Rock (for some inexplicable reason, this movie takes place during Christmas, although I distinctly remember this movie coming out in the fall).  For those of you who remember, Jingle Bell Rock was used as the opening song to LETHAL WEAPON, which was produced by Joel Silver (and who also produced this dud, so maybe he ripped himself off).  Obviously, a single soundtrack cut isn't enough to warrant watching a movie, so your best option would be to \"Getaway\" from this at all costs.",

            "content": "Getaway has been said to be nothing but a 90 minute car chase, and I couldn't agree more.\n\nGetaway is the gritty, exciting action thriller from Warner Brothers in which former race car driver Brent Magna is pitted against the clock as he commandeers a custom Shelby Super Snake Mustang, taking it and its unwitting owner on a high-speed adventure at the command of a mysterious villain on a race against time to save the life of his kidnapped wife.\n\nI didn't know much about this movie other then the fact that it had Ethan Hawke and Jon Voight in it. At that point I was hooked, but then I eventually see Getaway and I was so wrong about this movie. I was not really all that anticipated for it, but I was hoping for a fun action movie. As it turns out the majority of the movie is nothing but cars crashing in to each other. I love car chase scenes and I think there usually the best part, but this is what this movie was all about. Don't get me wrong I thought the action in this movie was really cool, but now that I realize it it became so repetitive that I was just annoyed by it. There was to much action to focus on that it became really boring. The story in general is such a lame concept that it's so ridiculous, that it's far from being generic. We've all seen stories like that before, but what makes this movie so bad is due to the script. It seems like the script was written by someone who just got out of Kinder Garden.  The movie look good from the first glimpse from the trailer, but what a lot of people tend to forget is that whenever a movie comes out for the last week of August you really aren't missing much. The month of August is usually a blend of pathetic movies, so as far Getaway goes they had two options. 1) This movie really should have not been made. Nothing happens at all and the story is never interesting at any situation. And 2) If they were gonna make it then release straight to DVD or air it TV. Because I doubt people are gonna see this on its opening weekend. Probably the worst the quality of the movie was the character development. As the movie was progressing I literally said to myself  \"Are they ever gonna in to detail with any of the characters?\" Obviously not because the movie was to busy showing cars bash in to each rather then giving us back stories on each of the characters. The movie suffered for a time length. The movie was only and hour and a half, but I don't understand why it felt like 90 hours. It felt like like I was watching a car driving for a whole day. Yeah that sounds like it could be fun, hahaha no. If I can say one something that's not negative, it actually was pretty awesome. It felt like someone else was directing this scene. If you end up seeing this movie you'll know what certain scene I'm talking about. But does that save the movie? Absolutely not. If you think about it this movie doesn't make any sense at all. As far as the acting goes it was pretty dull and I think the script took the fault for that. The execution was poorly executed that movie just keeps on going and going. If you were to pay attention on how the characters would interact with each other it's pretty sloppy. This movie has bad acting, a sloppy premise, too much action to really get in to and quite possibly the worst movie of August.\n\nI love Ethan Hawke and whenever I see him in an upcoming movie I want to see it immediately, but his character in this felt like wasn't good but he seemed to have an idea on what he was doing or what he needed to do. Selena Gomez as \"The Kid\" was incredibly annoying and I was never intrigued by her character because we didn't know anything about her. But again I have never been so annoyed by any character in any movie other then Selena Gomez's character.  Jon Voight was \"The Voice\" and he was so under used in this movie. If you know who we is or what he sounds like then there's really no point. The camera only get's shots of his lower mouth and I just found a lame feature like I can't even explain how bad they used his character. \n\nThe man responsible is Courtney Solomon who directed the crappy Dungeons and Dragons movie and what does that tell yeah. \n\nOverall Getaway is a movie that you just want to get away from. It's a really bad movie with nothing interesting to offer.  Too much action in a short time period that your bored after the first car crash scene is over.",

And yet, crucially, it doesn't mess up the film. Partly this is due to Gomez's surprisingly impressing performance as a hard girl, even though this is her debut in the thriller genre. But also due to good casting choices from director Courtney Solomon (even though that's one of the few things he gets right). If you came here for a 'Taken' meets 'Fast and Furious' tale of hostages and car chases, you got in the right car. This is a story, less of good versus bad but how much you will do for love. As everyone predicted, Getaway is a lot closer to Taken than a unique storyline: written by Gregg Maxwell Parker and Sean Finegan, Getaway has a very simple plot; the wife gets TAKEN, Brent Magna (Hawke) gets FURIOUS, He gets a phone call from a mysterious voice (John Voight) and has to follow all of his instruction whilst driving a FAST car to get his wife back, which happens to belong to The Kid (Gomez).  However, Getaway doesn't have the momentum to please the majority of crowds due to its unoriginal storyline. 3.5/5 (to be continued)",
