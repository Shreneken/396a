    "summary": "Plagued with worry and insomnia since saving New York from destruction, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), now, is more dependent on the suits that give him his Iron Man persona -- so much so that every aspect of his life is affected, including his relationship with Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). After a malevolent enemy known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) reduces his personal world to rubble, Tony must rely solely on instinct and ingenuity to avenge his losses and protect the people he loves.",

Tony has more to do in this movie, though him and Pepper still aren't as compelling as they were in Iron Man 1 or Avengers but they have more to do than they did in Iron Man 2 . Also there are more scenes in this movie of Tony being forced to solve his problems with creative thinking instead of just using his suit to blast through  his problems. Even the third act of this movie is pretty good.",

            "content": "Was very torn between a 3.5 or 4 here but went with the latter. This does what a sequel is supposed to do and also fixes quite a bit but not all of the problems Iron Man 2 had. The acting is better in this one with good performances all around. RDJ is much more likeable and charming here but not as much as the first. They toned down the jerk in him by a mile. The supporting cast is good all around. The villain isn't bad but I wouldn't necessarily call him good. The cinematography is solid all around with good camerawork and some effects like the ending are very well done and quite the spectacle. However some of the action can be a bit over the top and the red glowing effect looks bad and hasn't aged well in only afew years. Also outside of the ending there aren't a lot of locations that are memorable and not a lot of memorable scenes except for a few symbolic shots of him carrying the suit or how it reflects his current state. The music is pretty decent but not used a lot and is kind of underplayed and lacking any catchiness. The editing is the weakest part of this and while it is decent because it does get better and better as things progress, the first 30-40 minutes or so is very shaky and flat out not good in the first 10-15 minutes or so. It really feels like this film lacks focus in the first half just like 2 did but it does improve slowly but surely. This leads to a solid pacing as things pick up overall. There also are a few plot holes like Tony just happens to be transported to the small town in Tennessee, he just so happens to meet a kid who is super tech genius, his Mom just happens to be meeting someone to speak about her son that really were hard to swallow when the film was very unfocused and had me a bit worried but the second half really did a good job bringing everything home. Also it was cool how for most of the film we got to see RDJ fighting as Tony Stark outside of the suit which was a really original idea and done well. This film still has some subplots like the anxiety I feel could've been cut but its nowhere near as bad as Iron Man 2's bloated-ness was. It's a classic of the franchise but not of the genre as a whole. If your a Iron Man fan, really liked the second one or are a fan of any of the actors in this or director than give this a watch, it will pay off and be rewarding.",

            "content": "\"Like\" or \"love\" is subjective. That's objectively true. Scientists over a variety of different studies in which sets of two people were shown exactly the same thing and asked to describe what they saw. No two people said exactly the same thing. In fact, in one study in which the participants were asked to describe a person's emotional state, the participants frequently gave opposite answers. Is a slight smile \"happy\" or \"manipulative?\" Are turned down brows connected to \"sadness\" or \"disappointment\" OR are they \"relaxed.\" Or in another study, participants were asked to describe someone after viewing them for a limited time. Several participants couldn't recall a single detail. This is why eye-witness testimony by itself is unreliable evidence for a conviction in court.\n\nThis is also why two people can watch the same movie or TV show or listen to the same song and have vastly different experiences. Have you ever walked out of a movie feeling it worthy of an Oscar or to get to work the next day and hear a coworker say it was the worst movie they had ever seen? How can that be? We watched the same movie, right? For example, when I watched Iron Man 3, I thought Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was lackluster and \"phoned in.\" He almost appeared bored to me. However, according to others RDJ did an amazing performance and his \"take on someone with PTSD was inspired.\" Huh? PTSD, because of what? The alien invasion in The Avengers? I did not see it that way. \n\nAnd that isn't the only example. But as you can see the media we consume can garner different reactions from different people.",

            "content": "\"Iron Man 3\" is a 2013 action/adventure film directed by Shane Black and starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. The movie takes place after the events of \"The Avengers\" and finds Tony Stark grappling with PTSD and a new threat in the form of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley).\n\nOne of the standout aspects of the film is Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He brings a great mix of humor and vulnerability to the character, and his chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts is as strong as ever. The film's supporting cast, which includes Don Cheadle as James Rhodes/War Machine and Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, also delivers strong performances.\n\nThe action scenes in the film are well-executed, with some exciting set pieces that show off Iron Man's new suits and abilities. The visual effects are also impressive, particularly in the scenes where Tony's suits are flying through the air.\n\nHowever, the film's plot can feel convoluted at times, with multiple twists and turns that can be hard to follow. Some of the choices made in the story may also feel unsatisfying to fans who were expecting a more traditional portrayal of the Mandarin as a formidable villain.\n\nThe direction by Shane Black is solid, with a good sense of pacing and a strong visual style. The cinematography by John Toll is also impressive, with a mix of wide shots and close-ups that help to create a sense of tension and excitement.\n\nThe musical score by Brian Tyler is serviceable, with some memorable themes that help to elevate the film's emotional moments.\n\nOverall, \"Iron Man 3\" is a solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with strong performances and well-executed action scenes. While the film's plot can be convoluted and some of its choices may be controversial, it is still an enjoyable ride for fans of the franchise.",

I know some people hate on this film but I believe it's just because they got a more real and emotionally driven story and they fell for the plot twist. Tony Stark in the comics was an alcoholic and suffered from depression because of it, this film is the closest we get to seeing that. Now obviously we can't have the alcoholic in a Disney film but they opt for a more PTSD approach following the incidents from the first Avengers film. We see Tony have panic attacks and constant flash backs that lead him to over working to build suits for any threat to Pepper and the world. I loved this new grounded iron man, he still had the sarcasm, the humour and classic Stark swagger but the emotion drove us to care even more for his character. Ben Kingsley as Trevor was  amazing, a great twist and an amazing performance. Glad to see him return.",

            "content": "A delightfully funny and touching reflective piece for the third installment of Iron Man.\n\nDirector Shane Black's superhero action-comedy adventure Iron Man 3 (2013) is a high buzz of deliriously funny jokes and intriguing character drama that gets to the heart of Tony Stark's heroism. The entire point is about Tony Stark facing the consequences of his actions from cruelly blowing off a scientist, sleeping and ditching a \"botanist\" lady, to just simply getting Pepper Potts a terrible Christmas present. Shane Black's direction is a blast of chaotic action sequences that are well thought out in choreography and logic with Stark beating bad guys with wit as much as Iron Man's repulsor rays. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were smart to entrust Shane Black with Tony Stark's complex character and wicked humor for his stellar Iron Man 3.\n\nShane Black and Drew Pearce's writing is not only clever with their irreverent sense of humor, but also genuinely heartfelt as you see that indeed Iron Man's heroism comes from Tony Stark's bravery and perseverance. Stark grows as a man and learns new and innovative ways to be heroic. His genius intellect must be used to save lives and be kinder than he used to be during his days as a sleazy billionaire playboy. I found Black and Pearce's writing exceptionally profound as Tony Stark must solve his problems without the effortless use of his Iron Man suit as the real hero is the man himself.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. is hilarious again as Tony Stark as he feels cool and in control no matter how dire things get. Robert Downey Jr. plays up Stark's trauma and anxiety over nearly dying to aliens and a nuclear bomb in New York back in The Avengers. It feels thoughtful and funny as those scenes are due to Robert Downey Jr.'s insane charisma and natural hilarity. Robert Downey Jr. shows Tony Stark's failings and mistakes as well as his willingness to fix problems and deep character flaws at Stark's convenience of course. He just is Tony Stark really.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. gets the sincere, cute, and sarcastic romance drama exactly right alongside the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow as the fierce and caring Pepper Potts. All of Gwyneth Paltrow's expensive pantsuits and cute dresses look fabulous on her too from fashionable costume designer Louise Frogley. She's particularly breathtaking in Iron Man 3. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts will always have my favorite romance story of all the MCU movies. Gwyneth Paltrow is so playful in a snarky way, while also feeling distinctly mature for Marvel's movies. She handles Robert Downey Jr.'s ridiculous attitude and flippant remarks with a cool ease and deft grace. Gwyneth Paltrow makes Pepper Potts as endearing as Tony Stark honestly and even gets a killer finale sequence in Iron Man 3.\n\nDon Cheadle is quite funny and steadfast as Iron Man's sidekick Rhodey. He went from fun and reliable as War Machine to a true blue government stooge as Iron Patriot, even though I like the name. Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is a fantastic villain with understandable motivation. His fearsome fire breathing and red hot melting point powers are wild to behold. Rebecca Hall is so interesting and serious as Maya Hansen. She's a brilliant foil for Tony Stark and has a sweet scene with Pepper Potts too. \n\nJon Favreau's Happy has never been funnier or more ridiculous with his pompous attitude as Head of Stark Security. Sir Ben Kingsley is phenomenal as The Mandarin because he is genuinely frightening with his deep voice and harsh lessons for America, while getting seriously hilarious scenes in the last act. Stephanie Szostak is gorgeous as Brandt and really intimidating with her firebrand ferocity. James Badge Dale is cool with his calm presence as the fiery villain Coldblood.\n\nWilliam Sadler has a fun cameo as The President of The United States of America. Dale Dickey is touching in her mournful cameo. Ty Simpkins is cute as the eager engineer boy Harley, who helps Tony Stark in his hour of need. Paul Bettany's voice is excellently sarcastic as J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man 3. Bill Maher, Joan Rivers, George Kotsiopoulos, and Stan Lee of course all have quick funny cameos. You can see a young child actress Jenna Ortega as the Vice President's daughter. Corey Hawkins even has an early career cameo as a radar monitor before Straight Outta Compton. Mark Ruffalo's cameo startled me with laughter. Apparently, Fan Bingbing has a fast cameo in Iron Man 3 somewhere.\n\nEditors Jeffrey Ford and Peter S. Elliot cut so quickly during the exciting action, while allowing the drama scenes to gently garner emotions. Iron Man 3 does not even feel half its 130 minute length. Cinematographer John Toll captures magnificent wide shots of Tony Stark's mansion falling into the sea to intimate close-ups of Robert Downey Jr. mourning Pepper Potts or contemplating his regrets and anxieties. Iron Man 3 looks excellently shot just like Jon Favreau's Iron Man and Iron Man 2.\n\nProduction designer Bill Brzeski keeps Stark's seaside manor looking like a cool set with neat small town sets that look believable. Danielle Berman's set decorations add all sorts of technological props to Tony's labs. Art directors Alan Hook, Jason Bistarkey, Brian Stultz, Desma Murphy, and Jay Pelissier lean into terrorist imagery and fearmongering with crazy dark footage for Marvel alongside Stark's hopeful Iron Man suits getting rebuilt. The CGI feels advanced far beyond even The Avengers or early Marvel movies.\n\nComposer Brian Tyler opts for a darker and moodier score than the first two Iron Man films. His music effectively takes you into Tony Stark's mindset and conflicted feelings the entire movie. Sound designer Mark P. Stoeckinger adds these burning flame sounds and massive explosions alongside cool pulse noises for Iron Man's repulsor rays.\n\nIn conclusion, Iron Man 3 is a real blessing from Shane Black as his movie alongside John Favreau's Iron Man and Iron Man 2 are all fantastically endearing and entertaining movies.",

            "content": "Iron Man 3 was such a joy to watch as there were so many great moments throughout the film. The script is solid and doesn't shy away from any aspects, which leads to a great viewing experience. The main villain of the movie is rooted, and his motives are clear. Is he the best villain? No, but he gets the job done. The character arcs in this film are so much better here than in the second installment. Tony grew as a person and was able to become a better person overall. If I had to nitpick the script, I think I would have toned down the political tones a bit. It began to be a lot at times which I think was unnecessary. Another thing was that it felt a bit predictable at times. Using the shady businessman for the third time in a row does get a bit repetitive. Shane Black does a stellar job directing this installment and is on par with Favreau's work on the first film. There were plenty of scenes that felt inventive and unique, making the film have very few dull moments. Even with the more serious scenes, it still had the emotion it needed to be entertaining. To accompany Black's directing is some solid cinematography from John Toll. There are a lot of shots that look very nice and have some significant elements to them. Sadly, those two aspects get brought down by the harsh editing in the film. The action sequences have too many cuts leaving the scenes to feel rushed and messy. There are even a few scenes where some cuts don't match up with the shot before. The score does make up for this as it keeps the energy up in some of the scenes. Composer Brian Tyler created this bombastic score that impacted the film profoundly. The production and set design are also very attractively done. Many visually appealing locations complimented Shane Black's vision quite nicely. The cast also does a fabulous job here with stand-outs all around. Like always, Robert Downey Jr. shines on screen. This performance is the most human he has felt in any of the three Iron Man movies as he and Black translated what was on the script to the screen very nicely.  Gwyneth Paltrow continues to do great in the role of Pepper Potts. Although, her performance in Iron Man 2 is still the best out of the three movies. Ben Kingsley is outstanding here and created a lot of entertaining moments in the film. I can see why some people do not like his performance, but I thought he was a lot of fun. Guy Pearce is also a solid addition to the cast. His acting seems bland at times, and it does not help that his character is somewhat the same as the other two films in the franchise. Supporting cast members like Ty Simpkins, Rebecca Hall, and Don Cheadle are fantastic in the movie. Overall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed blockbuster that is so enjoyable to watch. The film does have a few blemishes in the script and editing department. Yet, the entertainment factor helps hide it at times. An exceptional cast, an outstanding score, and marvelous directing make Iron Man 3 a stand-out film in Marvel's cinema catalog. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",

The action alternates between a decent showcase of big-budget CGI and illogical messiness. Paltrow and Downey work well together and Don Cheadle and Paul Bettany (voice) seem to have fun. Simpkins is a rare likable child star, but the positives end there for the supporting cast. Guy Pearce brings all of the campiness and not much else for a villain. Ben Kingsley is very welcome in another villainous role but does little to justify his inclusion apart from a bit of hit and miss comic relief. The comic relief in general does not completely miss, but could be stronger and telegraphs much of its humour in advance. Rebecca Hall did alright, though it's another case of her not quite bedding into admittedly daft proceedings as with Transcendence. Iron Man 3 is above all light-hearted fun, and this covers its faults without coming close to setting the world alight.",

It isn't really the best ideas to make people who tried to kill everyone on the Earth best friends with the main characters. Robert Downey Jr. always puts out his best as Tony Stark. The Ironman franchise is one of my favorite trilogies in cinema history. I'm sad his story is over, but I am so happy about his character arc throughout the MCU.

There is something about MCU's Iron Man that I really like. The only Marvel comic I have read which has Iron Man in it is Avengers vs Thanos, and I really didn't like him in it. So to be specific, I really like everything about Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man. When I had watched the Iron Man movies for the first time, I used to always talk and behave like Tony Stark. That's how much he influenced me. And now that this was the fourth movie (including The Avengers), of course I was gonna like it.\n\nAs usual Robert Downey Jr was the star of the movie. Whenever he's in any scene, his charm always makes it interesting to watch. The movie begins with Tony having PTSD from the climax scene of The Avengers. And now he also has to battle The Mandarin. I had heard that people did not like what the movie did to him, but it was only after watching some videos I learnt why people were unhappy. Like I mentioned, I have only read one Iron Man comic, and that too I began just a few weeks ago. I watched this movie a few YEARS ago. So obviously, like Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor and Ryan Reynold's Green Lantern, I really enjoyed it until I learnt I wasn't supposed to.\n\nOther than that I like everything about this movie. Once again the CGI, the acting, the music is all great. This movie also has much, much better action scenes than most other MCU movies, considering Iron Man movies always have those. I get excited seeing one new Iron suit, here there are dozens. Consider me sold. The only one problem I had was how weak Iron Man had become, that his Iron suits are getting beaten up by normal humans with weapons.\n\nYou know those movies that stay in your memories but you don't talk about them until they are brought up? For me this is one of those movies. I watched it after he release of Infinity War, since that was the time I started watching all MCU movies to catch up before Endgame. This movie clearly stood out in my bingewatch. This is the reason why I'm all praises for it.",

If you guys aren't aware of things this film, and Manet most of phase one and phase two are where the villains of Marvel are eh. The worst one was Malekith from Thor: The Dark World, and this guy Killigan is no different. He's one of those characters where he gets ignored in his young age and then gets rich turns evil he grows up. This is not a bad trope for superhero movies, in fact there are ways to do this storyline to make it fun an interesting, but here it doesn't. For me personally Killigan is one of the weakest parts of this movie and it does feel like it's dragging when he's on screen. The same thing goes for The Mandarin. He's okay. But it feels like they could've done better. Overall Iron Man 3 was still fun when the heroes show up and the arm of Tony having PTSD from the attack of New York was really the most interesting thing of this film. And I like his dynamic with the kid because that seems to set up his future dynamic with Peter Parker / Spider-Man. And the action scenes are really fun and sometimes thrilling. So overall It's not a bad movie but it does need work on the script. 6/10",

Gwyneth Paltrow is better in this film but we see less of Don Cheadle. Trevor Slattery is a better bad guy than Aldrich Killian and he's just an actor. The final battle in general is really cool and we get the iconic plane scene were tony catches the people as they fall out of the sky.

But that's not what Iron Man 3 is. Iron Man 3 is more of a Tony Stark movie than an Iron Man movie. If it were called Tony Stark - The Movie, I would have probably reacted more positively. \n\nI was also angry about what they did to the Mandarin character. I knew Mandarin from the 1994 Iron Man animated series. He was a powerful villain. But now he's just a false flag actor? What? That meant Mandarin could never appear in the MCU again. Look, I'm a fan of taking risks and subverting expectations, but not like this. Have the Mandarin be the actual Mandarin, but the twist is he teams up with Iron Man against Killian or something. \n\nI've watched Iron Man 3 a couple of times since it came out, and now I have a more positive opinion about it. The most interesting thing about it is Tony Stark having to deal with the trauma of the massive New York battle. This makes the MCU feel much more real, with consequences and repercussions. So that's the movie's strongest point. This movie also further fleshes out Tony Stark's character.\n\nInitially, Killian seemed to be a very interesting vilain. At first he's an ugly and awkward guy, he's a cripple, everyone treats him like crap. But later he develops the Extremis virus, modifies his body, becomes attractive and people start treating him better. It would have been a good opportunity for some social commentary. But in the movie he's just a bad guy. At the beginning Pepper is a bit surprised to see him and she's attracted to him, and Tony is jealous, but that's pretty much all they do with it. That was kind of disappointing.",

But the movie has a lot of other things going on, there is also a whole storyline with a kid, the kid was good but all things mashed together wasn't a great end product.\n\nBiggest unpopular opinion, the twist was goood. Ben Kingsley was perfect for a fake mandarin and as a con artist, 'I am an Acctorr'. Seeing back that we are getting Shang-Chi with real mandarin and Marvel making a short clip owing up their mistake and saying real mandarin still exist was great damage control.\n\nThe villain was played great but felt short like all other marvel villains.

            "content": "I'm just going to go ahead and say it, Iron Man 3 really isn't a bad movie! Shane Black has a good reputation as an action director, that knows how to intercut action into a story, and stretch that PG-13 rating for good measures, so I was excited to see what he can do in the MCU. Having worked with Robert Downey Jr. before, they seemed to work together just as good, if not, better than RDJ & Jon Favreau. With such a great understanding of the MCU, and the help from a fantastic creative team, Shane Black and the crew lead this film to be one of the better films of the MCU. \n\nIron Man 3 sets itself as a good stand-alone film, but doesn't really compliment the saga all that well, besides following the events of The Avengers, and the crisp character development we get from our three leads in RDJ, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Don Cheadle. Shane Black set up some nice tones throughout the film that worked well off eachother. On the down side, there was a little too much going on, and the way scenes were set, was a little strange, and underdeveloped. \n\nAt this point, RDJ trademarked the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man. The best thing that Shane Black does with this film, is not so much make it an Iron Man film, but more of a Tony Stark film. The way his character is fleshed out, yet grounded, is just a breath of fresh air, giving Tony some vulnerabilities, while he still kept up with his wit, charm, humor, and swag. For someone who isn't huge on Pepper Potts, I really didn't mind her here. She gets a little more important with every appearance, which is something I'm not too fond of, but she served her purpose well this time around. Thank God, Don Cheadle is much more likable this time around! Although his character development was on the plus side, with some fun character moments, War Machine/Iron Patriot went just a little underdeveloped; I would've like just a touch more of him. I love Jon Favreau, everytime he strikes a scene, but he was sadly used soley was a plot device, not getting too much of his character, other than the first act of the film. Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener was just utterly annoying. Shane Black tried to utilize him as a good plot device to drive RDJ's character, but Simpkins came off as clueless, with a real mediocre performance. Guy Pearce tries his best here, and you can tell he was having fun, but due to his character being severely underdeveloped and unoriginal, he was just a corny villain, with okay abilities, and a breakaway crew. If Shane Black and Drew Pearce didn't spend so much time on his character doing pointless stuff, he could've been a decent villain that could pose a real threat. Now this guy named Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, was THE BIGGEST controversial aspect of the MCU, never mind of the film. I personally didn't mind the drastic change all that much, because it fit well with the narrative, but he was super corny and majorly underutilized.\n\nThe screenplay by Shane Black and Drew Pearce struggled in some areas, and succeeded in others. The biggest problem they had was writting some of these characters. If they just put a little more in a few of them, this film would've been great, especially with the jokes being the most cohesive and funniest yet, thanks to Shane Black's style.\n\nI really enjoyed the action this time around, not only because of how well it was balanced, but because of the high stakes. All of the effects looked great, continuously taking a step up from film to film.\n\nOverall, I can totally understand why some people may not like this film, and that's perfectly fine, but due to the sharp character development, fun story, and great laughs, Iron Man 3 is definitely one to check out.",

Iron Man 3 has some great action sequences, like the plane rescue, and the final battle. But everyones biggest issue is probably the Mandarin Twist. many didn't like it simply because in the comics, it was the Mandarin that was Iron Man's defining villain, but the twist was silly nonetheless. They swapped a great villain for a mediocre one. This movie is not at all terrible, or as bad as people say, but Aldrich Killian has the same motivation as Syndrome, so it feels copied. Also, the ending is kinda weird. Iron Man trashes all his suits and Tony stops being Iron Man, but then in Age of Ultron, it retcons this. This movie is underrated, but still has a ton of flaws.",

One of my favorite sequences of the film is the DIY fight that Tony has. He has to create his own improvised weapons when the suit fails on him. Disappointed with how the Mandarin was very underused, but you can't win everything. Overall, definitely better than most people make it out to be.",

It delved into his PTSD and addressed side effects such as a developed anxiety now apart of him, brought on by his experience.

The third entry, I just absolutely love. Robert Downey Jr. did a phenomenal job once again for playing: Tony Stark/Iron Man, people do not like this movie a lot because: \"It has more Tony Stark than Iron Man!,, I don't see why that's a bad thing. This movie is obviously not directed by Jon Favreau but that doesn't matter much, it is still a great movie! Some were disappointed when they found out The Mandarin was actually an actor in the movie, mostly because Iron Man never really had his main villain like Captain America has Red Skull or how Thor has Loki. Turns out Aldrich Killian was The Mandarin all along which was revealed at the end of the final battle. After Pepper killed Killian, Tony took a break from being Iron Man by throwing Arc Reactor in the ocean. This movie is really funny and it is a great Action-Adventure, Sci-fi, Fantasy, Comedy, Superhero movie. If you LOVE Iron Man and MCU/Marvel, this movie is a must watch, you got it on Disney+ so, you can watch it there. I feel like this movie has some Mission: Impossible movie elements in it which is the franchise I love. M:I movie elements in this movie are the aeroplane sequence and some other sequences. This movie is a MUST WATCH!",

I really like Tony's relationship with the boy, the action is really well-handled and for the first 75 minutes, the Mandarin was handled really well, established to be a great threat who we fear but the Mandarin twist really butchers the villain and movie. There's still great action and clear stakes to be found with the President but by that point, you don't care that much as you're let down by the villain reveal and Killian was not built to be a good threat so the stakes are just down and it's kind of disappointing we don't see Tony in his suit much during the finale (even if I understand the message) but it's still a good movie that I enjoyed and it's easily the most unnecessarily hated MCU movie. Seriously, these audience review make me want to vomit. Oh, wow, it didn't follow the comics. It's automatically awful. Just shut up idiots (B)",

This film is very divisive amongst Marvel fans, but I don't read the comics so I didn't care as much as others, let's just get the elephant out of the room right away, the Mandarin twist was very risky and interesting, he was more compelling of a villain than Guy Pierce was, but I really admire the risk that Shane Black took with this iconic comic book villain. Robert Downey Jr. is just as likable as ever, his character is humanized and develops very nicely, he starts to have panic attacks after what happened in The Avengers, and it was very interesting to see him go on this journey of self-discovery, I think that his character arc in this film was very well defined and achieved really well. Guy Pierce is an amazing actor, but his character was boring and stale, he just didn't contribute all that much to the overall plot. Gwyneth Paltrow was very good again as well and delivers a spectacularly powerful female motivational role in this film. Jon Favreau was out of basically the entire movie, and I missed him. Don Cheadle was very good as well, he just didn't get much to do. All of the action sequences are greatly shot and executed, they are not all over the place happen too often either. I loved the final battle with all of the Iron Man suits, it was so awesome and made it feel like such a grand spectacle. This movie doesn't contribute much at all to the overarching storylines in the rest of the MCU, but it does wonders by making a character study of Tony Stark. This film isn't great, but it is very impactful for the character of Tony Stark and makes for a fun and emotionally resonant tale when it comes to Iron Man, the villain could have been better though.",

I think Iron Man 3 lays out Tony Stark - his genius and his new awareness of his weaknesses and anxieties. Iron Man is not superhuman and I appreciated the fact that the film dealt with Tony's PTSD. It was also an effective counterpoint to Stark's dazzlingly quick wit. Despite the slightly darker tone and more realistic threat, the film led by the charming Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious and great fun. I think I'll even add it to my Christmas movie collection as it's rather festive. I love we got more Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, especially now that she's badass Pepper. I also thought Ben Kingsley was great - in both of his roles. ",

Aside from that, the movie itself is pretty decent. I hate saying this every time, but RDJ does a seriously good job playing Tony Stark again--and this time I mean Tony Stark the human, not Tony Stark the Iron Man. I say that because this movie shouldn't even be called Iron Man III. It should be called \"Tony Stark: The Movie featuring the worst attempt by Marvel to do a twist villain ever.\" We really get to see his character development in this movie, and it could've been done so much better...

The villain is good at creating scenarios for Tony to prove himself however he is pretty surface level.

Shane Black, the co-writer and director, ought to and has to justify his characters by giving them enough reasons and room to pitch in, no matter what and how big a price he has to pay, he takes it with a big smile on his face. In the previous chapter of Favreau, the humor was turned to 11, and even though compared to it, it still is low and smooth, it also is questionable at times in here.\n\nPersonally, I feel that this is MCU's biggest threat, contrary to popular opinion, this double edged sword might one day consume a film in its sweetness. Take the last act, for instance, Downey in a port going mano-y-mano with Guy Pearce and taking heavy losses still keeps a certain levity in his vocab. Now, this is something that often happens in this franchise that vigorously rottens its sincerity. These tiny things are accounted, for the game this franchise is now, a mistake like such isn't acceptable.\n\nAnd not that the film is competent in every other way, in fact, if anything, it sort of is a mirror to the original Favreau chapter, from cornering Downey to prove himself beyond and without his wealth and fame, to still trying to balance him on the edge of the responsibility factor. Don Cheadle gets a much bigger half in the supporting cast, with lots of eye rolling and sarcastic exhales. Excluding the fist fight, Pearce is not a threatening antagonist, nor is Gwyneth Paltrow or Rebecca Hall a decent supporter. Ben Kingsley's character paints the picture with accurate colors, where Downey tries a lot but against all odds, Iron Man Three remains a distraction, a colorful one though.",

Not just Tony's, but across the board, from the Mandarin/Trevor to War Machine/Iron Patriot, identities are in question and in flux at a fundamental level, and the movie is driven less by its (often just passable) action sequences than by subjective turmoil and character development. Don't get me wrong, there are suits-a-plenty throughout the movie, but they largely take a back seat and play only a supporting role, to the point, in fact, that the most compelling fight scenes are those with Tony alone, sans suit, fighting with his wits and mind rather than wires and metal. Ultimately, then, the armor is disposable and interchangeable, not essential or unique to Tony---unlike in the first two installments, where new bodies inside the suit are always a threat---there are many people who slide in and out of the exoskeleton, the suit less of a character or weapon in its own right (which is why its emptiness can play as a surprise) than a prosthetic for the voices emanating from it.",

One scene or scenes that I didn't like was that the fighting ending. It was bad because I think it lasted too long. This film was more interesting than entertaining, this was the events after Avengers so Tony was going through some mind-boggling experience.\n\nThe audio was good but was way too loud (explosions). Adrian Killian was a good villain, it wasn't what I or anyone wanted. The special effects were incredible. I would not recommend it.

It undermines much of the complex character development, which is a shame, because Marvel tends to gloss over character development in favor of action much of the time. Overall, a wonderful movie that teaches people that it's okay to struggle, as even \nheroic genius billionaire playboy philanthropists do.

            "content": "Iron Man 3 is a bad movie. This sequel was such a huge disappointment. Shane Black ruined the Iron Man Trilogy by making this franchise-killing movie. Iron Man 3 is like other bad and disappointing trilogy finales such as Spider-Man 3, Blade: Trinity, and X-Men: The Last Stand. The plot is bad. The movie starts with Tony in a science conference in Bern, Switzerland. He meets a really nerdy guy named Aldrich Killian who is a huge crazed fan of him. He asks him to join his \"think-tank\" organization A.I.M. He asks Tony to meet him on the roof later. Tony gets in bed and gets laid with his short-time girlfriend, Maya Hansen, whose boss is Killian. Minutes later, Killian is standing on top of the roof in the cold night all by himself waiting for Stark to meet him there, but Tony forgets or ditches him like a douche. The next morning he writes on a card \"we create our own demons\" for some reason. So in the present time, he forgets all about that night in Switzerland. I honestly don't know how he could forget about a night like that. So in the present time, he tries putting on his new Iron Man armor, Mark 42. He listens to a Christmas song from his record while assembling the Mark 42, but then it stupidly breaks apart so easily. It was such a stupid scene that didn't even need to be in the movie. It was literally put in their for some pointless comedic purpose. Then Tony turns on the TV to see what was going on in the news. The Mandarin is on live television making threats to the United States of America. He claims to have made a lot of bombings in the U.S. Tony goes to a bar to talk to Rhodey about the Mandarin. Rhodey tells him it's classified information, but ultimately secretly tells Tony that there has been nine bombings and that the public only knows about three. Two kids walk up to Tony to get his autograph. They hand him a paper with a picture of him as Iron Man sending the nuke into outer space through the wormhole (which is obviously a reference to the alien invasion scene in New York in The Avengers). While he was signing his autograph on the picture, he gets all nervous and accidentally breaks the crayon, and one of the kids asks him how he got out of the wormhole. He then immediately quickly walks away from the bar while having a panic attack and goes inside his Iron Man armor outside of the bar in public. He asks Jarvis to check his heart rate. He tells Tony that his heart is fine and that he was not having a heart attack. He basically tells him that he was experiencing PTSD. He flies off in his Iron Man suit. I don't understand why Tony Stark would have PTSD when every other superhero has been on so many adventures [dangerous undertakings] but don't have PTSD. It is so dumb. In the next scene at Stark Enterprises, Happy Hogan is telling every new security guard (that aren't wearing their security badges) to wear their security badge. Killian unexpectedly shows up there and he looks completely different from what he looked like back in the beginning of the film. Happy tells him that he was supposed be issued with a security badge, but Pepper tells him that it's okay. Happy sits on a couch and is very suspicious about Killian and watches him talk to Pepper. He calls Tony on his iPad and tells him that Killian is back and that he's trying to make a move on Pepper and that he should be down here. Tony asks Happy to flip the iPad screen so he can see what was going on, but for some stupid reason Hogan doesn't know how to flip the fucking screen. Stupid writing. It's so stupid that a full-grown adult doesn't know how to flip the screen of a fucking iPad. He thinks he needs to be a tech genius to know how to flip a screen. Hogan is a fucking idiot. I always hated him. He was always a horrible and unlikable character. Killian tries to convince Pepper to fund his think-tank, but she ultimately refused. He was disappointed but took it like a champ and walks away in his truck and drives off. Hogan takes a picture of his truck's license plate right before he leaves. Pepper comes home and sees that Tony got her a giant stuffed bunny that looks silly. Pepper sees Tony wearing the Mark 42 armor in the house. She comes downstairs and finds out that Tony was actually not wearing the suit and was somehow controlling it without a remote. It was a dumb surprise and it was unfunny. She gets upset at the fact that Tony ate dinner without her on date night. He tells her that he thinks she was flirting with Aldrich Killian behind his back, then the Mark 42 slowly turns its head at her which makes her upset and uncomfortable. She gets upset at Tony and walks away, then he apologizes to her. He tells her that ever since New York he constantly worries about her and himself because of his post traumatic stress and that's why he spent so much time alone building as many Iron Man suits as possible. She tells him that they're just distractions and that he spends too much time with his Iron Man armors and not enough quality time with her. I understand the whole meaning behind that entire scene, but it is so poorly executed and feels so annoyingly overdramatic. Later at night he has a nightmare/repressed memories in his sleep of him going through and falling out of the wormhole in New York. Pepper tries to wake him up, but then the Mark 42 suddenly gets so close to them on the bed like as it were going to attack them and frightens them. He makes the Mark 42's power go off and for some stupid reason he hits it which makes it break and fall apart on the floor like it was a pile of junk. How the heck are the Iron Man armors so weak and fragile in this movie, but so strong and stable and can take many hits in the previous Iron Man movies? It doesn't make sense. This movie is filled with so many gigantic plot holes. In Iron Man, the Iron Man armor can take a hit from a tank missile, but in Iron Man 3 a hit from human hands and a truck can easily destroy it. Tony is an idiot in this movie and gives his own home address away in public on live television to the Mandarin in case he was watching the world news on live television. So because of Tony's stupidity and arrogance, there were A.I.M. terrorists in helicopters shooting and destroying his mansion. His pet robot Dum-E was destroyed all because of Tony's stupidity. Rhodey was barely Iron Patriot in this movie. The acting was bad. All of the jokes are unfunny. The Mandarin plot twist was STUPID AND INFURIATING!!!! It's like one of the worst plot twists in cinema history! The real villain was Aldrich Killian who had a cliche and dumb motivation. He was basically a rip-off of Syndrome from The Incredibles. Iron Man 3 was a lousy rip off of The Incredibles! Killian became a super villain because his feelings were hurt by Tony Stark all because he ditched him at a meeting on a rooftop which happened 12, 13, or 14 years ago! Stupid movie. The enemies in this movie are so fucking cheesy. The villains are Extremis people that BREATHE FIRE!!!!! OH MY GOD, THIS MOVIE IS SO FUCKING STUPID. Rhodey never even killed anybody nor kicked ass in the Iron Patriot suit. He had his ass handed to him so easily by a female Extremis A.I.M. soldier disguised as a nun. Iron Patriot was scanning all of the people in the building to detect Extremis heat signature, but he couldn't detect her for some reason. So when she shakes his hand, her hand turns hot and causes him to get paralyzed temporarily. Iron Patriot really sucked in this movie. Then he gets kidnapped by A.I.M. Eric Savin (Killian's sidekick) steals the Iron Patriot suit from Rhodey. Savin for some reason is already a pro at using the Iron Patriot armor even though it took about almost half a movie runtime in Iron Man to learn how to fly and use an Iron Man armor. So he flies off to Air Force One and the president and everyone else there mistakes him for Col. Rhodes. Savin goes inside the airplane and kills almost everyone in there with the Iron Patriot armor. Rhodey should've been the one kicking ass like that in the movie, not some generic bad guy henchman. Tony Stark is BARELY Iron Man in this movie. The movie unnecessarily takes place around Christmas. It was more of a Christmas action/comedy James Bond wannbe film that ripped off the plot of The Incredibles. They completely wasted Ben Kingsley in this movie. He was really playing a dumb drunken British actor who is also a drug addict named Trevor Slattery who was pretending to be the Mandarin the whole entire time while Aldrich Killian was really behind all of those terrorists threats and bombings all just because Tony ditched him at a meeting. So Savin reveals his face to the president and kidnaps him. I don't get it... He makes the president wear the Iron Patriot suit and forces him to fly off to the docks? Am I missing something here? Why didn't the president just try killing Savin with the Iron Patriot armor? Because later we see President Ellis come out of the Iron Patriot suit at nighttime in the third act in the docks. The third act was so clunky and a big CGI marathon of a mess. All of the Iron Man suits fly to the docks and try killing all the Extremis henchmen. Why do all the Iron Man armors get destroyed so easily in this movie? Why are the Iron Man suits so crappy in this film? I hate the way this movie treats advanced technology. Why didn't Tony just upgrade his suits? At the end of the movie, Pepper saves the day instead of Iron Man/Tony Stark. Tony decides to blow up all of his suits just to please her. Pepper is an annoying and unlikable bitch. I honestly wanted her to die in this movie. I was so disappointed to see her survive the fall later. This movie sends a really bad message to men about romantic relationships. He shouldn't have to make all of his armors explode just so he can spend time with that annoying bitch of a girlfriend. Him sacrificing his hobby sends a very bad and vague moral message to the audience. People should never have to sacrifice their dream for love. This is a very disappointing end to the Iron Man Trilogy. Iron Man 3 makes Iron Man 2 look like Citizen Kane in comparison. Iron Man was fantastic. Iron Man 2 was okay. Iron Man 3 was bad.\n\nRating: 4.2/10",

The heart and soul of this film is yet again represented within Tony Stark who is effortlessly played by Robert Downey Jr. for the fourth time, reaching even bigger heights by brilliantly portraying his anxiety story thread giving us a stoicism character whose chemistry shines beneath the surface and his dialogue feels natural and slick. \n\nThere is a shot when Tony gets to Tennessee and it's snowing and Tony sits there with his new broken prototype alone and this one shot showcases Tony's emotions and how he has been pushed to his outer limits. The musical score behind this is beautiful and reflects upon the events that just occurred at his Malibu mansion (a scene that had outstanding cinematography and was all round exhilarating with an exciting musical backdrop). Infact, the musical score is well composed throughout the picture and makes the action even more thrilling and intense. Iron Man's light motif is exhilarating and always gets me pumped for what they is to come. However, Iron Man Three's biggest flaw is the Mandarin plot twist, turning Tony's biggest antagonist into a laughing joke was heartbreaking for Iron Man fans and catapulted all of the embryonic potential that adjoined this character. \n\nNonetheless, Iron Man 3 withholds strong and powerful characters and despite the insanity and darkness of Extremis and The Mandarin, Iron Man 3's script has wit that still maintains the excitable stakes in every sequence. The Iron Man suit isn't widely used but that doesn't matter when you have a energetic, charismatic and bold lead performance by Downey who steals every scene he is in. In the end, Iron Man 3 is a bold, exciting, thrilling movie with an extremely adventurous plot and a few outstanding action pieces; it's a sequel that does everything I wanted it's predecessor (Iron Man 2) to do. An amazingly dazzling movie and Tony finishes his trilogy with a blasting festival.",

And better than most second ones. Stepping away from Favreau's direction was refreshing, and maybe that's the key here. Shane Black's writing and direction of Robert Downey Jr is masterful. While (spoiler alert), the twist with the Mandarin was silly (yet probably the best way to have the Manadarin in a feature film since he has always been a lame, yet prominent Iron Man character), introducing AIM the way they did and moving the story along through some great dramatic dialogue and storytelling, bumpered by flawless action scenes, proves that one can do a third movie in a franchise that isn't worthless. The ending blew me away though, and I'm convinced there will never be an RDJ Iron Man solo sequel again. We will see him in Avengers 2, I believe Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers 3, but that's it. And maybe even only as Tony Stark. Just as team rosters changed frequently in the comic, so shall, I believe, we will see in the films. Just as Nolan told the perfect Batman stories, RDJ IS Iron Man...and Tony Stark. There was never anyone more perfectly suited to play them both.",

At the same time, a terrorist named The Mandarin begins a string of bombings that Tony has to investigate. Meanwhile, he comes into a conflict with an old enemy, Aldrich Killian. Robert Downey Jr. is, as always, incredible as the billionaire turned superhero and just like other films in the franchise, it features a talented cast. Shane Black directs this time around and he keeps the humorous but mature tone of the previous installments in the franchise, he directs some great action moments, while developing Tony's arc in a brilliant way. There are some issues with this film though. Characters are brought on board and then are completely ignored. The biggest problem is the way the villain in the film is handled. There is a twist that is certainly pretty underwhelming and at the end of the day, the threat is quite generic, unable to live up to the stronger, more emotional aspects of the film, especially its ending, which was nearly perfect for this trilogy. It's all in all still a solid addition to the overall franchise and better than the second Iron Man film, but it could have been better.",

I really liked Shane Black's directing and script and I thought his humor was just great. Stripping away everything from Tony and giving him nothing more than just a few tools to work with was a very wise choice. It provided us with some great action sequences. Were it really lacks though is in the CGI department and the villain is also quite stale. Especially the Extremist stuff looks very fake. Aldrich Killian has an interesting and formidable power set, but he is just not a good character. There was also this one moment were Pepper supposedly dies, and it is immediately followed up by a joke, I really didn't like that. I also really liked the score for the movie, Brian Tyler has crafted a pretty amazing theme for Iron Man. The thing that really stood out to me though, was Tony's PTSD. They handled that very well and it provides us with a real continuation from where we left of with The Avengers. Overall, Iron Man 3 is a pretty good entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I liked that Shane Black got to keep his style of directing.",

            "content": "There are some things to enjoy about this movie. Seeing all the different Iron man suits was good. Having all the the Iron man suits be the same color and mostly the same style up to this point was getting tiring, so having new suits and a new way for Tony to call it was a very nice introduction. While I wasn't a big fan of the more natural color of the suit in the beginning, it did grow on me throughout the movie. The relationship Tony had with the kid and Pepper was great as well. You could feel that Tony and Pepper had history and their chemistry was always great. The introduction of the younger kid showed a nice new side of Tony and the jokes with the watch were good. I also liked the fact that the villain (more on that later) was not a guy in an Iron man suit. While I did enjoy Iron Man 2, I felt the final battle with Whiplash in a suit felt forced and unearned. This final scene with the extremis drones felt more natural as we had seen their journey as villains.\n\nNow let's start the bad things off with undoubtedly the biggest complaint everyone has on this movie, the mandarin. It was just terrible. When the trailers came out it showed a villain worthy of the audience's fear, he was leader of a terrorist group, he wanted to fight the Avengers for thinking they were better than everyone else. He didn't care who he hurt, he was a threat. When it was revealed that he was an actor, the movie just stopped for me at that point. They tried to correct by having Killian say he was the true mandarin, but the damage to me was already done. I was looking forward to Iron man going back and fighting the terrorists that created him, not some whiny guy who got stronger and can apparently only breathe fire for show.\n\nAnother big problem I had was with the direction they took the new suits. I loved seeing all the different types of suits, what I didn't love was the fact that we never got to see what the different suits did. The promos showed, the space suit, the deep sea suit, the drill suit. I was speculating that the battles could be across different terrains and it was up to the suits to help Tony out of the situation. All they ended up doing was coming apart and flying about. It made them all feel the same and so, worthless. The only one that did anything different was Igor, which everyone thought would be the proto-hulkbuster, so having him literally used to hold up some metal poles felt a bit wasted.\n\nI also didn't like the different types of Tony Stark we got in the film. We got a guy who was able to build suits no problem, but then we got a guy who was suffering PTSD after going through the wormhole in the Avengers. We then got the guy who built tech from a kid's toy in order to get into the hide out, which was then followed by a guy who didn't even know how to use a gun. His character felt all over the place and just didn't work for me. There was nothing in Avengers to say that he was suffering, and there was nothing afterwards. He has a fear of something coming but not sleepless nights. It just didn't work for me.\n\nVerdict: Major Surgery\n\nWhile this film did have some nice moments, overall it just did not work for me. I wanted an Iron man that had to face the demons of his past. The 10 rings, the fact that he had stared an alien race in the face, this new super human serum coming back from someone he had shrugged off could all have shown that Iron man's actions have consequences, but it ended up just being a forgettable movie that didn't progress the larger MCU in any way.",

This is directed by Shane Black who had some good ideas but also some terrible ones. First off, this movie is pretty much a way worst version of The Dark Knight Rises. For most of the movie Tony Stark is not in an Iron Man suit. Frankly I would rather him be in his suit for at least a flipping quarter of the movie! Another terrible choice is The Mandarin twist. The trailers and the first half of the movie set up an amazingly menacing villain in the form of The Mandarin. If you did not know The Mandarin is Iron Man's arch-nemesis. He was even acted by Ben Kingsley! It looked like he would be the second best MCU villain besides Loki but they squandered it. They made him into a bumbling idiot who was forcefully taken out of the movie. Instead of that great spectacle we got a guy who breathes fire and is acted by Guy Pearce. I mean Guy Pearce is great and all, his best movie is easily Memento, but he is no Ben Kingsley. Terrible! To make matters worst he is killed by a raging Gwyneth Paltrow. A great idea is Stark made around a hundred Iron Man suits and in the end battle he unleashes them on Killian's men. Though the biggest of the bunch is only used to lift a container. It makes for a great end battle. Another bad decision is Stark blows them all up at the end for a Christmas special for Pepper's delight. This should have been a great movie but it was just good. Overall good movie but disappointing compared to The Avengers. Thumbs up.",

The second Iron Man was mediocre but somewhat watchable at least but Iron Man 3 is a gigantic mess. A poorly written storyline that contains the worst plot twist (Mandrian Reveal) I have ever seen in the movie. The characters are overall handled terribly to the point where the movie feels like a big joke. Speaking of jokes there are so many forced on bad jokes that get shoehorned into this movie to the point it is cringe-worthy. The final act was a big CGI catastrophe that was completely pointless and dumb (Don't even get me started on Peppers turning into the human torch like thing). Robert Downey Jr. is the only saving grace in this movie. He is really the only good aspect of this movie. But overall he is not enough to save this movie.

            "content": "With comic book movies, there is a repeating cycle. The first one has our attention. The sequel, most of the time (in the case of Spider-man 2, The Dark Knight, X2, etc.), outdoes the original. But then we are eventually faced with the third part. In some cases (The Dark Knight Rises), the third part kicks ass. In most cases (Spider-man 3, X-Men: The Last Stand), they are the weakest. Luckily, this is simply not the case for Iron Man 3.\n\nThe film takes place after the events of The Avengers, and Tony Stark (the always wonderfully charismatic Robert Downey Jr.) is falling apart. He's losing sleep, he's having anxiety attacks, and he is slowly becoming distant from his faithful girlfriend Pepper (wonderfully played by Gwenyth Paltrow again). But it only gets worse when a terrorist named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley, putting on a chilling accent) starts wreaking havoc across the globe.\n\nGuy Pearce shows up as a scientist named Aldrich Killian (what a villain name), and if you know anything about Guy Pearce, you can assume Aldrich isn't very nice. Rebecca Hall, who is very underrated might I add, shows up as Maya, a scientist girl that Tony met in the 90s. And Don Cheadle reprises his Iron Man 2 role as Jim Rhoades, Tony's best friend. There are a lot of plot details that I will leave out because I want you to see Iron Man 3 with an empty mind, otherwise it can't be enjoyed.\n\nI was feeling a lot of things throughout Iron Man 3. I was really into it in the first half hour. Then, these weird fire people showed up, and I thought, \"Oh God, are we watching Thor?\" (I actually love Thor, but I found the blend of fantasy at first off). But as the film went on it all made sense and I accepted it. Then, I was also feeling de ja vu, because I felt like Killian and Mandarin were fairly similar to Justin Hammer and Ivan from the previous. But that is one of the wonderful things about Iron Man 3: It's unpredictable.\n\nIron Man 3 is damn good. The heart and soul of this trilogy is Downey Jr., and here is is at his best doing what he does best. Iron Man is my favorite of The Avengers, and really, could you blame me? Downey's amazing. What helps this time is the fact that this one is directed and co-written by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Black has a gift with blending action with humor, and this is easily the funniest of the trilogy. It is also the best acted.\n\nI had a total blast here. Is it as good as something like The Dark Knight trilogy? Well, if you know my stance on that trilogy, then that answer is obvious. Is it as good as the first two? Yes, and maybe even better. The film has a great energy, a great sense of humor, some terrific surprises and some terrific action sequences that will leave the inner nerd within jumping for joy.\n\nI find it difficult to give comic book movies a 10/10, mainly because I have such a high standard when it comes to them. Yes, perfect comic book movies exist. Is Iron Man 3 perfect? Not quite, because it doesn't exactly have the themes that the perfect comic book movies acquire. In other words, I wasn't moved by it. But that's okay, because the Iron Man trilogy isn't meant to be taken as seriously as some others, and so they shouldn't. But no comic book movie in a long time has danced this close to perfection in a long time. This could be the end of Iron Man. I hope it isn't, but at least he goes out in style.",

I've never quite understood some of the hate it has received from certain segments of the online movie community. I do think it is an improvement over Iron Man 2. Though I enjoyed that film, it did try to do too much in one movie, in my opinion. Iron Man 3, by contrast, seems like it has less distractions and is more streamlined. I would also argue that it is the Marvel Cinematic Universe film that bears the biggest imprint of its director. I've enjoyed the works of Shane Black so far, and this is distinctly a Shane Black picture. However, because of this, at times the movie feels like it isn't sure of its identity: is it more a Black film, or does it more fit in the MCU brand of filmmaking? I'm not really sure. Also (and SPOILERS for a movie that's been out since 2013), the choice to make the Mandarin essentially a fake-out was a bold move. I understand where those who hated this move come from, but I found it gutsy and unexpected. I will say, the times Ben Kingsley plays the Mandarin \"in character\" is more compelling as a villain than Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian, which is a shame since still I enjoyed Pearce's performance. Another thing I can't help but feel about this film is how meaningless the ending now seems. Granted, it's not a true criticism as its not fair to judge a movie based on its follow-ups, but the choice to have Tony Stark \"retire\" as Iron Man feels hollow since he's back in the armor by the beginning of Avengers: Age of Ultron. It does show how much the character has grown since the first film (and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance brilliantly illustrates this), but this choice of plot point seems odd considering Marvel already had plans to have him back in the armor without having to goad him out of retirement (I will say I do think the emphasis on Tony Stark's PTSD stemming from The Avengers was excellently done). Overall, these are elements that I believe can be overlooked, as Iron Man 3 is still an entertaining story.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, we just watched Iron Man 3 - the first Summer blockbuster of 2013. What did you think?\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, Iron Man isn t my favorite superhero and so I went into the theater with low-ish expectations. I left surprised at the quality of this movie. Shall we recap?\n\nGREG: There s a new terrorist in town - it s the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). He s responsible for seemingly random bombings of great power across the United States. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is taking these bombings seriously because his bodyguard and good friend Happy Hogan was a victim. Stark lays down the gauntlet telling the Mandarin through the media that this time, it isn t politics that motivates him - it s revenge.\n\nSCOTT: Stark underestimates the Mandarin, who lays waste to Stark s home and nearly kills him, his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and an old girlfriend with a dangerous secret. Stark travels to Tennessee to examine a bomb site and soon learns that the Mandarin is using maimed U.S. war veterans to test Extremis, a new method of regenerating human limbs that turns people into molten-hot superhumans. The Extremis procedure sometimes fails, causing some veterans to literally explode. These are the Mandarins so-called terrorist bombs, and after Pepper is captured by the Mandarin, Stark s mission is to stop him and his legions of superhumans, and to bring Pepper to safety.\n\nGREG: Stark is plagued by Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to his experiences in New York City (see The Avengers). This is his Missing Inner Quality: he lacks confidence in himself. And this sets up the real thrust of this film. While on one level it s all about catching the Mandarin and stopping him, it s really about Tony Stark competing with the Iron Man suit. The majority of the action in this film surrounds Tony Stark using his intellect and special gifts as an inventor to uncover the basis for the terror attacks.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, you ve identified the central reason why I truly enjoyed this film. Stark shows a vulnerability and a humility that we haven t seen in previous installments of Iron Man. He confesses that Pepper Potts means everything to him, thus revealing a renewed set of priorities in his life. Happy s severe injury is also a staggering blow. We see him reach out in kindness to a young hurting boy. And he has panic attacks. Stark is a man who has been knocked down a few pegs, and quite frankly I enjoyed witnessing him throughout this movie redefine himself and create a somewhat new and softer personal identity. My issue with previous Iron Man movies was Tony Stark s utter macho narcissism. It s refreshing to see him in this film display the kind of vulnerability necessary for him to heal, to grow, and to transform himself.\n\nGREG: The production values were amazing. I saw the film in 3D and it was mind blowing. The Iron Man costume in this film is deconstructed so that individual parts of the suit can fly across the room and attach to Stark s body. It created some very cool effects and some excellent plot twists. Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin was simply brilliant. I bought in to his character completely. The terror propaganda was especially well constructed.\n\nSCOTT: Hearing you say this makes me regret seeing it in 2D. But even in 2D, the film is a visual delight. Most of all, the hero story works to great effect. Our hero Stark is brought by the Mandarin into a special world fraught with danger. We have a sinister (and deceptive) villain, a love interest, helpful sidekicks, and an unlikely mentor in a 10-year-old boy named Harley whose advice ( You re a mechanic - make something ) is exactly what allows Stark to defeat the Mandarin.\n\nGREG: The film isn t perfect. I was most offended by allusions to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein as mere figureheads to their terror organizations. I don t think most Americans (and certainly most warfighters) saw them as just figureheads. Also, the premise that human beings would become super-strong, regenerative, and explosive by inhaling a medication was more than I could believe. It seemed a plot device more suited for the X-Men than Iron Man.\n\nSCOTT: I was willing to overlook these flaws, if you could call them that. After all, superhero movies take place in fantasy universes with their own peculiar set of physical laws. I rather liked the Extremis effects -- human flesh became red-hot liquid steel and were more than an equal match to any of Stark s suits. But the important thing to me is the hero story, which was utterly satisfying and earned 4 Heroes out of 5. This Tony Stark has me interested in Iron Man again. The film itself was a visual delight and was able to combine humor with action in a very effective way. I give this movie 4 Reels out of 5. Movie: Hero:\n\nGREG: Well I guess you have a better imagination than I do. Even in Science Fiction you have to acknowledge the existing science. I don t see how inhaling any substance can make one s hair fire-retardant. Still this was an exciting beginning to a summer destined to be filled with Science Fiction and Action films (is Summer coming earlier each year?). I give the film a rating of 4 out of 5 Reels. But I think this is the most perfect hero transformation I ve seen in any of the Marvel films. I really liked the emphasis on Tony Stark, the man, as opposed to Iron Man, the suit. I give Tony a full 5 out of 5 Heroes. Movie: Hero:",

Initializing the \"clean slate protocol\" almost made me cry haha.\nINCREDIBLE ENDING to what is believed to be the last \"Iron Man\" film starring RDJ.\nOverall, the Iron Man films have proved to be the core balance of the newly founded Marvel cinematic universe, bringing together the perfect dose of action, comedy, romance, and moments every fan will remember forever.\n\nEnd credit scene is Tony Stark going through a therapy session with sleepy Bruce Banner listening to his rambling story.\n\nStan Lee appears as a judge for a Christmas pageant. (Not mistaken for a lookalike as usual in the \"Iron Man\" films)",

It subverts expectations and reminded me of a time when plot twists were more common. Like, you know, one of the primary characters being someone's imaginary friend or the protagonists being on their home planet all along. I ain't telling their names and besides, everyone knows about these twists now. Anyway, where was I? While, yes, Iron Man 3 lacks some of the first film's thrills, it more than compensates with great performances, amazing visual effects just like any MCU movie and brilliant action sequences. It also has a good amount of jokes, as well. Not Guardians of the Galaxy or Ant-Man-type funny but there's still some witty dialogue that ought to earn a chuckle or two out of the audience. I don't get it, why people consider this movie \"bad\". Sure, most third entries are when the quality begins declining. And, yes, it's not as good as Avengers as I previously pointed out. But come on, stop acting like a bunch of butthurt DC fanboys. Not that there's anything wrong with DC aside from all that false advertising in Suicide Squad and Martha in BvS. Phew, good thing I just happen to be a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (except maybe in the first half of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s first season and 55% of Iron Fist). Otherwise, I would've mercilessly ripped this film to pieces. It's not as bad as some make it out to be. I enjoyed it. You did your best, Shane Black, and at least you know enough people liked it so that it could get a Saturn Award introduced in that year. You've earned my respect.",

The film is a little darker and more serious than its predecessors but not by much. Entertaining adventure, some cool action sequences, with some surprises, let's get right to the surprises. 1 of the notable twist was Ben Kingsley's supposedly role of The Mandarin, wasn't really The Mandarin, he was just an actor with substance-abuse hired by the real villain to fake it. Ben Kingsley's talents were wasted. As a long time, comic book fan, I've gotta say, that was truly a disappointing twist in the movie, disgusted by it. And that's that.",

The invitation for a showdown is met leaving his personal and professional world in ruins.\n\nPerceived dead, Stark must embark on a treacherous and harrowing quest for retribution to regain his life. Relying solely on his own devices, ingenuity and instinct, he must protect both the 'one he can't live without and the President of United States and stop the Mandarins reign of terror. \n\nThe key lies in uncovering the source behind a series of mysterious explosions that lack a detonation device, obviously connected somehow it highlights a new player in the endgame, or is it just an old discard of Stark's now demanding his attention. \n\nIn the end, as per all comics, there is always a moral to the story that secretly haunts the main character, and Iron Man is no different: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man? \n\nBalancing our dynamic superhero with some key one liners, is the perfectly manicured and impressively buffed Guy Pearce as DNA tampering Aldrich Killian, and proving the conduit for some emotional depth is talented youngster Ty Simpkins in the role of Harley (also giving Downey a run for his smart alec money). \n\nNeedless to say, if you have seen the trailers hinting at Stark's cliff-side mansion collapse, the massive oil-rig explosion, the mid-air human monkey-barrel style plane rescue and the obscene amount of superfluous Iron Man clones all doing their fighting whilst flying thing, the innovation and execution of the films booming visual effects is simply jaw-dropping spectacular. \n\nThe Verdict: In what can only be described as the best installment yet (and in saying that, hopefully the last to end on a well-deserved high note), Iron Man 3 delivers on every super-hero flick requirement. From imagination to excess, wit to star power, as far as entertainment goes this is the best option around; even if the plot and its quirky twist is as outlandish as Starks gizmos.  \n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 10/05/2013",

It's definitely the 2nd best Iron man movie, I like it a lot more than iron man 2. This is a perfect summer movie, if you want a fun time, then watch this movie, because it's so fun I promise you won't be disappointed at all.

On top of insomnia and work obsession, past mistakes come back to haunt him.\n\nThe storyline is suspenseful,, creative, and well put together.\n\nThe rock solid love between Tony and Pepper was sweet. Their relationship can clearly withstand a lot. It was a romantic ending, and I love that Pepper is the one who actually takes out the almost indestructible bad guy Aldrich Killian, after a knock em down drawn out Battle between Stark and Killian. The fireworks finale to the battle scene was perfect.\n\nAs usual, Colonel Rhodes has a significant side kick role to play in saving the day (and the President). They're both Iron Man, although very different personalities.  \n\nThe addition of a little boy as sidekick who gets to help Iron Man adds to it; giving kids a chance to imagine themselves in that role.

            "content": "It is nice to see a simple Iron Man movie without SHIELD or Avenger movie messing it up. Tony Stark is a dismissive jerk, and this time it comes back to haunt him. In a flashback to 1999, he rudely disregards an emerging enthusiastic scientist. Fast forward fourteen years that scientist reemerges as a handsome and successful businessman who soon finds himself at odds with Stark Industries. Amidst his business relationships, Tony Stark publicly challenges a global terrorist known as the Mandarin, who swiftly retaliates by targeting him. It is finally nice to see Tony humbled and undone by his reckless abrasive personality. In the course of events, he finds himself without a functional armored suit for much of the movie, and his better qualities shine through to save the day. We get to appreciate Tony Stark for the mechanical genius he is, not just a spoiled brat with infinite funds and firepower. The villain is good, but the showdown action scenes between him and Iron Man do not come through. There is too much going on at one time during the climax of the movie. It would be nice to distil this down to a clearer and more exciting finale.",

For example: Tony Stark is asked a question about whether he-s scared of the Mandarin or not, well he says he isn't and proves it by TELLING A TERRORIST WHERE HE LIVES which, in my opinion, is the stupidest thing ever done in a Marvel movi, so far, and there's one more that sticks out there Happy dumps into the guy carrying all of these weird breathing thingy's and takes one from him and on jis way out of there he bumps into Savin and he asks him what's he doing here and if he saw a movie hiw good was it. Rather than play it cool, safe and non risky, he says a little movie starting you and your friend over there called the parties over. Here's my ticket. Then he shows Savin what he stole and then they get into a big fight which nearly kills him and I don't feel so bad for him when it happens because it pulled a very stupid move to get there in the first place. Also I am one of the people who doesn't really care much for the Mandarin twist so yeah. But all in all it's a bit better than it's predecessor in terms of havins subplots that actually do something and better action, so, in my opinion, it's a pretty solid film that has smart and dumb moments and if you can get past the dumb parts then your going to enjoy it even more.",

The characters; Again Robert Downey Jr. is awesome in this film, in fact he has a lot more humanity to his character this time around in this film. This movie focuses more on Tony Stark than Iron Man which might be a bad thing for some people who love their action, but I liked the direction it was going with his character. Gwyneth Paltrow is again great as Pepper Potts, I'm interested to see what direction they'll go with her character after her transformation into the Extremis. Don Cheadle was awesome as Rhodey, he is a lot more likable in this film than Iron Man 2. The rest of the cast is fine.\n\n2. The action; this movie has the best action out of the whole trilogy. The action is filmed so well and it is a lot more fun. My favourite action scene is the finale as well as the airplane scene which was actually real and that definitely added more intensity and credibility to the scene. There is also some action scenes that involve Tony himself, such as the mansion scene where he takes out guards in a very entertaining way. Overall Iron Man 3 handles its action excellently.\n\n3. The feel; this film does focus more on Tony Stark than Iron Man like I said, which might bore some people wanting more action but I honestly liked it especially the scenes he has with that kid. You honestly feel for Tony a lot more in this film and it adds more humanity to his character. This film seems to stray a bit more away from the typical superhero blockbuster extravaganza, which I loved.\n\nNegatives:\n1. The handling of The Mandarin. A lot of comic book fans are mad about this, I'm not a reader of comic books honestly but it did kind of bother me. Don't get me wrong the scene where its revealed that The Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley (who was great by the way) is just an actor was really funny and unexpected, but at the same time I felt it was a missed opportunity cause he could've potentially been a great villain. The real Mandarin turns out to be Aldrich Killian played by Guy Pearce which definitely did disappoint me.\n\n2. I didn't care for Maya Hansen played by Rebecca Hall. Rebecca Hall is a good actress but her character was underdeveloped and when she does eventually die I didn't care to be honest. One more negative is that I didn't care for Killian's henchmen who were the people infected with the Extremis, I was like \"meh\" whenever they showed up.\n\nOverall:\nI had a lot of fun with Iron Man 3. It is not as good as the first movie but it is loads better than Iron Man 2. I liked the characters, the action and the overall tone of the film, but I definitely was let down by the villain and it could've been handled better.",

Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the handful of defenders for the film, but the third entry just doesn't have the same spark as the first two films do.  Shane Black takes the film in a much darker direction.  That's fine, especially considering what Stark went through during the events of Avengers, but I think there was something missing in Iron Man 3, and I think the tone has a lot to do with that.\n\nConsidering the film begins with the Eiffel 65 classic Blue (da ba dee), Iron Man 3 is a bit of a departure from the previous Iron Man films.  Disappointingly, the film also doesn't contain any AC/DC songs or Ramin Djawadi's score.  It does however, supply a memorable score from Brian Tyler.  Besides that, all of the actors are back and the cast welcomes in Rebecca Hall, Guy Pearce, and Ben Kingsley in pivotal roles.  Tony and Pepper are now living together *happily* with Happy and Rhodey not too far away.\n\nI understand people wanted the film to take a different approach after the mixed response to Iron Man 2, but this film was missing Jon Favreau's touch.  Not only did he not come back to direct the film, but Happy only gets a few scenes as he's hospitalized for the majority of the run time.  Don Cheadle has more action, but Tony Stark in Tennessee for the entire second act, I felt like I needed more Rhodey as well.  If anything else, the problem with Iron Man 3 is the writing.  Downey and Paltrow still have magnetic chemistry, but everything else feels different from the previous entries.\n\nThat brings me to the infamous Mandarin reveal.  I actually don't have as much of an issue with the direction they took Kingsley's character as everyone else does.  With that said, I can't say I wasn't at least a little disappointed that there was no real presence of the ten rings or anything that felt all that threatening.  I'm glad they decided to have a villain not in an Iron Man type suit to give Tony something different to fight, but as great as Guy Pearce is in other films, he just didn't do it for me as Aldrich Killian.\n\nThere is definitely something to the argument that this film needed more Iron Man.  Ty Simpkins plays Stark's tech sidekick back in Tennessee, and he's good, but I would have liked to see a little bit more Iron Man screen time.  But the counter argument to that would be that Tony Stark is just as entertaining as the metal head himself.  And that the insomniac Stark they were going for, kind of makes sense.  The central theme of 'demons' was an interesting take and probably the most necessary one at that particular stage in the universe. I can appreciate the gutsiness by the filmmakers to approach the character in this way, if only The Incredibles hadn't really done the exact same premise 9 years prior.\n\nOverall, I really like Iron Man 3.  It's a much different take on Tony Stark and it was the next logical step for the Marvel Universe.  I just wish the writing had been more in the vein of the first two Iron Man's and not strayed too far away from what we love so much about this character.\n\n+Insomniac Stark\n\n+Fully functional Pepper & Tony\n\n+Tyler's score\n\n+Cheadle gets more action\n\n-Different approach to the villains didn't pay off\n\n-Needed a bit more humor\n\n7.8/10",

            "content": "Whatever Marvel movie followed The Avengers was going to struggle to overcome the scaling back that, in this franchise's very particular case, was unavoidable. Marvel movies, for better or worse, never take place in a vacuum, and for four years and five films, this studio was building toward something massive and unprecedented. And guess what-that movie didn't disappoint. So Iron Man 3 needed to somehow both pay deference to our journey so far within the Marvel world and also come down from a film about six superheroes to one about, well, just Iron Man. And guess what-it does just that.\n\nFollowing the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has been asked to serve mankind as Iron Man only in matters intergalactic. His best friend, Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle), now also known as the \"Iron Patriot\" is America's metallic protector against enemies foreign (as long as their of this world) and domestic.\n\nSo Tony holes up with his woman, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and tinkers with his toys. The Iron Man suit must be better than ever if he's going to avoid another trip into a wormhole-an incident that induces panic attacks all this time later. With a new threat-The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley)-gleefully wreaking havoc across the world, it seems like Tony can sit this one out. But the forces of evil at play here hold a special connection to Stark, and before long, he's suiting up again.\n\nFor the first time in the history of this series, Jon Favreau stays in front of the camera exclusively-reprising his role as Happy, Tony's bodyguard. He opted not to take the reigns as director for a third time, passing those responsibilities to Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang helmer Shane Black. While Black doesn't have enough directorial credits to leave a strong, noticeable mark on the picture, Iron Man 3 doesn't really miss a beat, and he deserves a lot of credit for that.\n\nEven more impressive than any stylistic tendencies at play here is the film's tone, which REALLY feels on point. Downey and Black have chemistry, and that chemistry made Kiss Kiss one of the last decade's most underrated comedies. Their collective quick wit is in abundance here; in fact, it's probably the film's greatest asset. There's a surprise near the midway point that's plays out so humorlessly that the rest of the film could have, I don't know, featured a deluge of incomprehensible action scenes aboard an abandoned and crumbling oil rig, and I'd still recommend it...\n\nSo about that conclusion...it's kind of a mess. The entirety of Iron Man 3 hinges on Stark's gadgets on working at key points. It's an incredibly frustrating crutch Black overuses whenever he wants to create some additional tension, and it's never worse than during the film's final 20 minutes. And the action during these sequences? Multiple Iron Man suits do battle, and we've seen it all before.\n\nBut the whimsy brought to this film through Black's pen and Downey's usual antics are more comforting than a warm blanket on a cold winter evening. This is the best Marvel film since Captain America: The First Avenger, and a reminder that superhero movies need not bear the weight of humankind's existence on its shoulders. Simply fighting a bad guy, when done right, is more than enough, as it is in Iron Man 3.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/iron-man-3-review/",

Iron man's got a new suit where he can practically whistle and it comes from all directions to assembly on him. It seemed kind of passe in the beginning and they came up with silly reasons for him to do it, but in the end it actually was quite awesome. \n\nSome of Stark's really old \"pals\" end up as the bad guys and its surprisingly well how much Tony gets to build as a character outside of the now established Avengers organization. The fight around \"Iron Patriot\" is also surprisingly funny and meaningful to the plot. I recommend.",

However this third movies has added new flares and surprises that Iron Man fans would enjoy.\n \nRobert. Downey, Jr, manages to maintain the same smart, witty character now but with the added anxiety attack issue Tony Stark deals with. All the actors in this movie did an excellent job performing their roles and adding to the story. The film has managed to keep everything  seamlessly from Iron man one to three, while including what happened in The Avengers movie. Iron Man 3 had fewer events that took place and focused more on the character of Tony Stark; looking at how he lives his life and handles past events that have impacted him. Which in the end left you wanting for just a little bit more story line, unfortunately.\n \nThis movie has some great twists, for example: the villain who is portrayed on TV threatening the president is not the actual villain, it's just a cover. The real villain chooses a man (who is an actor) with a different ethnicity than regularly found in America. He stages the background of these videos to look like it's being shot in a different country as well. This makes all eyes look outside the country for this man, not inside America, keeping all the attention off the real villain. You get a surprise when Tony bursts through this man's bedroom door to discover that truth.\n \nThe film does a great job tricking the audience about what took place. The director has the viewers pause in shock about what just happened only to see a second later what actually happened. For example: Tony was dressed in this iron man suit and was saving people in the air who were free falling to their death. Tony goes and collects all these people in the air then safely drops them into the water. As Tony fly\u0092s up from the water and over a bridge, he looks back momentary giving the audience a feeling of relief that he saved them all, then he gets hits hard by a bus and all the armor breaks into pieces. Shocked, moments later you see a screen where Tony has been directing this Iron Man drone to do all that work for him, he was never in the suit.",

I did appreciate Ben Kingsley's Mandarin angle in this narrative and his performance was solid as always.\n\nMy only real criticism of this Iron Man is that I felt barely any continuity from the last MCU movie, and it could have almost been placed anywhere in the timeline.

This entry was directed and I think written by Shane Black who has written such awesome movies as lethal weapon 1 and 2, plus The Last Boy Scout he knows action and it shows. \n   Our story pretty much covers Iron Man right after the events of the Avengers he seems to not be sleeping, spending more time building more suits, suffering post traumatic stress disorder. All the while going on in the not so shadowy world there is a not-so-secret terror out there that calls himself The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who is a modern terrorist leader who will get in front of the camera now a days and pretty much go on about some sort of political rhetoric before threatening to do something harmful. Which over the course of the movie, he keeps his promises and there are some unfortunate events that do culminate in Iron Man and Colonel Rhoades played again by Don Cheadle joining forces as a buddy cop team pretty much to find the Mandarin.\n   When they find the Mandarin the movie sort of does a Kansas City Shuffle; in the way that while everyone's looking right the movie went left. Again I repeat I liked the twist I really did and I really like the symbolism involving with the actual villain in the movie. I won't reveal who but I will say that it was a \"Guy\" and he tended to \"Pierce\" through my soul with his acting ability. I do feel that the story ended rather perfectly with what it had built up and and left up to debate like I think we'll be seeing Tony Stark is Iron Man here and there but maybe not as much as we would like to or probably could since Robert Downey Jr is technically a senior citizen.\n   As the movie was over and even after watching it a second time I still feel that I really really enjoyed Iron Man 3. It's definitely head and shoulders above Iron Man 2, but just a eye line below Iron Man 1. I can only hand out recommendations like flyers for this. Fans of the Iron Man movies , comic book movie fans, action fans, Shane Black fans, and overall was just a really fun time and a really quick and enjoyable 2 hours that I'm gladly more than willing to put up again to watch a 3rd, 4th, or a 5th time.",

            "content": "Robert Downey, Jr is the best thing about Iron Man Three.  If this trilogy proves anything, it is that Downey's best natural gift, his mouth, hasn't worn out its welcome.  He has a rapid-fire speaking manner in which it takes you a second to register what he just said. Like Groucho Marx, his mouth is ready with a verbal gag almost before he can complete the thought.  He is really a wonderful comedian with the rare ability to mix the comedy with a certain amount of vulnerability.  This is a rare and precious gift at a time when most screenplays march their characters through wooden, pedestrian dialogue that only functions to move the characters from one plot development to another.  For Downey, it is such a unique gift that, while you're watching Iron Man Three, you realize that he alone is keeping the movie from becoming a crushing bore because by this point, he is keeping afloat a series that - hate to admit it - is running out of gas.\n\nIron Man Three is a well-made, skillful action movie - the special effects are convincing, some of the action scenes work, but they are at the service of a plot that is completely canned.  Here again is another story of a superhero battling and army of super-villains who want to take over the world while also dealing with domestic issues that no suit of iron will be able to cure.\n\nThe suit, for Stark, has become the same prison that it was for Batman, only in Stark's case he has become dependent on it.  How does one balance time with the girlfriend and saving the world?  He could do this because the public has fallen in love with War Machine, a new Iron Man occupied by Tony's pal James Rhodes (Don Cheadle).  This should leave Tony more time to be with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) but she complains that he is spending all his time in the lab building new Iron Man suits.\n\nDomestic bliss is only part of Stark's problem.  The latest threat to civilization is someone calling himself The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), an impressive-looking cloaked figure with his own private army that has been committing acts of terrorism on every shore.  His private army seems invincible, they attack and walk away unscathed due to new developments in genetic recomposition -  yeah, apparently that's a thing.\n\nStark goes on television and makes an unbelievably stupid proclamation to The Mandarin and later finds his house under attack and Pepper missing.  That's a problem because, while the first movie allowed Tony and Pepper time to develop a sweet romance, this one keeps them apart for most of the film.  We're told how much Tony loves her (he narrates the story) but their scenes together are all too brief.\n\nThe presence of The Mandarin, you should know, is also all-too brief.  This character is to Iron Man what The Joker is to Batman, but there's a problem here: He's hardly in the movie.  You'll be alarmed when you realize that 95% of Ben Kingsley's performance was captured in the trailer and that the movie reveals a plot development that relegates him to a cameo role.  If you were looking for a big showdown between Downey and Kingsley, you're going to be sorely disappointed.\n\nMuch of the plot can't be revealed here without spoilers, suffice to say the movie is entertaining without being extraordinary.  You'll find that the action scenes get the job done, but if you're looking for world-class plot development, you'd be best look elsewhere.  Director Shane Black, the scribe responsible for the screenplays to The Last Boy Scout, The Last Action Hero and the Lethal Weapon movies injects a refreshing sense of humor onto a dead plot and wisely makes time for Robert Downey, Jr. to simply do what he does best, just talk.",

Firstly.....Robert Downey Jr is a number 1 badass as Iron Man!!! I like how he acts and how he is when it comes to being witty. He is almost the merc with the mouth (DEADPOOL MOVIE NOW PLEASE!!!!!). I also liked the action scenes which were packed full of explosions and smart gestures that made up a pleasant scene. However, there were a few negatives about this film that I have to mention. The second half of the film was just meh to me....I mean sure there was 'action' but it was all a bit slow moving and just made me shrug my shoulders. The ending frustrated me the most.....it to me just felt like he just gave up in the end and quit abruptly as being Iron Man. \nSo to sum it up, Iron Man 3 is a pretty good film was some highs and lows.",

But this one is like the worst of the worst that can happen to him. The looks on this is much better than its predecessor. And there's a lot of Iron Man Armors in here. Like a bunch of them, which makes this one way more bad ass. Guy Pierce as a villain is impressive. I did dig up his performance. He's a perfect antagonist with a vengeance. His power is fire, burning heat that can melt Iron Man's armor. That is pretty intense. I love how Iron Man controls his Armors. And I love the last fighting scenes on this. That was incredibly amazing. I did have chills, All the Iron Men and Potts became a bad ass. That was sick. I love it! This is maybe the most intense Iron Man film I've seen.

The action scenes are impressive, and some of them are actually not from the suit which is nice to see.With the surprises, I feel like it's a mixed opinion for everybody, probably close to negative which seems reasonable enough, until the one shot made it all better for the fans who were really mad at that the twist. There's some stuff that doesn't work, but the script is still good and it's cool, and the right thing, that Tony Stark gets PTSD from the New York attack. Iron Man 3 is still not as good as the first film, but it's still a worthy addition to the Iron Man series.",

Obligatory overkill. \n\n\"So you can breathe fire?\" Cheadle asks the real Mandarin. Yes, but apparently only once. You get an all-you-can-stomach smorgasbord of one-of-everything. You're senses will be subdued--overwhelmed--it's impossible to be bored, you get your money's worth of manic sights and pounding sounds. So why is it ultimately so unsatisfying? Since when is way too much not enough? This is the cinematic equivalent to over- indulging in franchised junk food. CGI obesity. High carb thrills. They'll soon have to supply cinemas with vomit bags. \n\nStill, I prefer Iron-Over-the-Top-Man better than Super-Off-the-Charts- Man. But I don't think anyone really knows how to pull off a well-rounded CGI-based movie yet. Well, there's always Avengers 2015 when Joss Whelon re-calibrates the signal-to-noise ratio, and hopefully restores some of the nuance needed to offset the onslaught of mindless action and sarcastic dialogue. Failing that, we can always hope for James Cameron's Aquaman.\n\n\"You can save only one, the President or Pepper Potts,\" Stark is informed. Wait! You're telling me they're not the same person?

Unfortunately,  we do not live in such a world. Iron man 3, whilst not the overall worst, may however be the most aggravating film the studio has ever produced. And thats a large call from a studio that makes, in general, far less superior superhero films than should be expected. To me this is the worst film in the iron man trilogy and for one very good reason: it could have been the best. In fact, the film had the potential to be the best the studio has ever produced.  But no, it squanders its talented cast and promising story on a reveal that feels cheap and lazy.  This film began rather promisingly, with the first scene a nice look at who Tony Stark was before certain events, setting the film up nicely. And then, the mandarin enters our screens portrayed by the all-powerful Ben Kingsley. And for the first time in a marvel film, I was actually captivated by the villain. The mandarin was (at least initially) a villain who had no motives other than to hurt tony stark because he could. Sir Ben Kingsley gave us a creepy, archaic and barbaric villain who put Tony Stark in actual danger. Gave him uncomfortable choices to make. Properly threatened him. When the film progresses however, you begin to suspect things are not always what they seem. The second act is a little dull and frankly lacks both action and suspense. Nonetheless,  the third act is by far the worst because it just proves how dumb marvel actually are. Ben Kingsley is NOT the mandarin. The spine tingling performance he gave was just a guy acting for someone else. Guy Pearce, who wants to turn everybody into weird green mucus monsters is the \"real\" villain. I mean, are you out of your mind, marvel? Guy pearce is a good actor, but he is NO Ben Kingsley. The best and actually first engaging villain, and he's not even the real villain. I mean, every bloody iron man villain is the same. Tony Stark offends them or does something they don't like, so want revenge; its extremely unoriginal and plays with only one-dimensional characters. This pissed me off very much so. The ending just feels anticlimactic and after the big reveal , nothing seems threatening. All is going to be fine. This movie actually made me question whether marvel actually make their movies dumb on purpose. Honestly, it would be like if in The Dark Knight, the Joker was actually just an actor. No, its actually The Penguin who's the real brains. Marvel you are now officially on my death list. As well as the moron who wrote this thing. I'm looking at you Shane Black. Just die",

There are some built in twists that keep the viewer in the dark for some aspects.  The action is ridiculous, but it is fun and works within the inner logic of the series.  The villain in this film and the heat-producing soldiers provide the needed antithesis that allows the viewer to consider them as worthy opponents of the Iron Man suit and allow for the possibility that Iron Many may not survive this battle.  This film retains the laid back humor and attitude from the predecessors, but the action is one notch higher.",

            "content": "Ah, now here's a film that really seems to split its fan-base right down the middle, having not seen a comic book film stir up this much controversy since The Dark Knight Rises. Many might hate me for saying this, but I enjoyed Iron Man 3 for what it was and for the most part, I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire film; once Blue (Da Ba Dee) by Eiffel 65 started playing over the Marvel and Paramount logos, the tone for this movie was instantly set and I knew I was in for something fun. After all, Iron Man 3 was easily a huge step-up from its generic predecessor, Iron Man 2. But there are many complaints regarding this film, and I'll address all of the major ones. First of all, I enjoyed how Tony Stark wasn't entirely his eccentric, carefree, narcissistic self in this film. It's clear that the events of The Avengers and the near-death experience in the wormhole has affected him severely and therefore, gives us a bit of a darker tone as well. To me, that showed that there's some actual depth and complexity to Tony Stark's character rather than him just simply being a complete narcissist, and that came off as very refreshing. As for Tony Stark having to go without his Iron Man suits for a huge chunk of the movie, I thought that was very interesting as well. It shows that Tony Stark can still be resourceful and useful even without his armor, proving that it is in fact the man that makes the suit and not vice versa after all. And while I didn't get quite as much Iron Man action as I wanted throughout the film, the final action scene certainly makes up for that. The humor was very witty and spot-on and for the most part, fits well into the film. The only problem I really have, and that everyone else seems to have, is the plot twist with \"The Mandarin\". The twist reveals to us that The Mandarin isn't really The Mandarin, simply rather a washed-up actor paid by Killian to give his crime syndicate a face, someone to blame everything on. Now from a film standpoint, I thought this was a brilliant twist for the film to make and if this were any smaller villain or a different movie entirely, this twist would've worked. But this is The Mandarin, Iron Man's arch nemesis, and doing something like that is really going to piss off a lot of loyal fans of the Iron Man comic book lore. Now because of that, I can certainly see why fans hate this film, and I don't blame them one bit. Imagine if The Joker in The Dark Knight turned out to be nothing but an actor while the real mastermind was someone else entirely; it would've pissed everyone off, and with good reason. Taking an iconic character and turning him into a simple plot device is basically like the filmmakers saying that they don't care about the character or the fans. And even though I don't know much about The Mandarin from the comics, this is nonetheless upsetting even to me because it ruins a beloved character that had the potential to be really amazing. Simply put, the twist works from a movie standpoint, but not from a comic book movie standpoint. And really, the whole film in general is like that: it works as a movie but not as a comic book movie or even an Iron Man movie. But it works well enough to keep me entertained and with these solo Marvel films, that's enough to ask for.",

It falls into the same trap that other superhero movies sometimes do; while the characters themselves are good, the plot itself is relatively uninteresting. Also, the mix of humor and seriousness isn't quite as balanced as the original Iron Man. There are scenes of intensity that are followed closely by clever/cheesy one liners, so you're never sure if you're supposed to take the events in the movie all that seriously or not. The drama is occasionally well handled (the climax) but sometimes unconvincing (Tony Stark having anxiety attacks caused by his near death experience in The Avengers). \n\nNot to say the movie is at all bad. For the most part, it's very entertaining. There are some laugh out loud moments throughout, and plenty of good visuals and action. Downey continues to prove that he's the perfect actor for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Paltrow is equally game as Pepper Potts. Guy Pearce makes for an OK villain, but he isn't particularly memorable.\n\nOverall, Iron Man 3 is a solid movie. I wouldn't rank it amongst the 'best' superhero movies to ever come out, but it's definitely one of the better ones. A must see for fans of of the Marvel superhero universe, and a reserved recommendation for non-fans, as long as you don't expect anything truly great.",

While (spoiler alert), the twist with the Mandarin was silly (yet probably the best way to have the Manadarin in a feature film since he has always been a lame, yet prominent Iron Man character), introducing AIM the way they did and moving the story along through some great dramatic dialogue and storytelling, bumpered by flawless action scenes, proves that one can do a third movie in a franchise that isn't worthless.  The ending blew me away though, and I'm convinced there will never be an RDJ Iron Man solo sequel again.  We will see him in Avengers 2, I believe Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers 3, but that's it.  And maybe even only as Tony Stark.  Just as team rosters changed frequently in the comic, so shall, I believe, we will see in the films.  Just as Nolan told the perfect Batman stories, RDJ IS Iron Man...and Tony Stark.

If the point of the movie was that Stark can survive through his wits, sarcasm and ingenuity, well we established that in the first movie, it's why he's Iron Man.

It makes me think the fighting scene will be exciting. \n\nThe focus of Ironman3 is about Tony Stark how to overcome a new enemy while he is facing his own fear about losing power without the robot suit. The whole movie is showing about how Tony changes his mind toward power.   \n\nThe most exciting part for me is the last part, which is fight with last boss in the film. He gives up most of his robot suits. It matches that he has a new ways toward power and he become a normal people again in the ending.\n\nFor me, I think the middle part of the film about how Tony Stark facing problems is a bit too long. It is quite boring when I watching it.\n\nAfter watching Ironman3, I think it is worth to watch. The robot suits in Ironman3 is more than Ironman 1&2. And especially the last part, people would be shock when they see what Tony was done. And the CG effect of this time is also amazing too.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nIron Man 3 is set after the event in New York City and Tony Stark is suffering psychological problems from it, while at the same time, a new threat arises that calls himself the Mandarin.\n\nThe reception for this film was all over the spectrum, with some completely hating it and others unshakably praising it. After finally seeing it, long overdue and with enough distance from the hype, I can certainly say that this film is a blast. The film is certainly far from what the genre could offer but it impressed me enough to claim that this so far is the best from what Marvel/Disney/Paramount has produced.\n\nThe film's plot isn't the film's strength as it certainly includes elements everyone has seen before but it is Shane Black's direction that prevents this from being just another comic-book film. Black takes a predictable tale and spices it up with a couple minor twists, comedic and witty dialogue exchanges, and surprisingly deep character development to keep the audience on their toes and also become heavily invested with the titular character. It was truly fascinating exploring the psychological and emotional layers of Stark as that was something I never saw from the character before, in previous films, it was hard for me to relate or connect with the character because of the persona he creates for himself and previous directors never revealed any cracks for the audience to peek inside. Black was able to deliver this much depth while also maintaining that superficial wit that the character is known for, he may still speak like a smart ass but at least there is a reason for it.\n\nThe film contains a couple of antagonists, with each projecting a different level of threat. I was pleased with the way the writers handled the Mandarin as it definitely delivered something quite surprising. Aldrich Killian was a bit of a disappointment, not structurally as he did come off as quite a threat particularly during the third act, but as a person he just came off as a bit hollow and slightly clich\u00e9; but then again that is why they had the Mandarin as that character definitely delivered something that Aldrich Killian lacked.\n\nThe action set pieces were satisfying but nothing indulgent. It simply lacked the thrills that other action films seem to produce recently, but by the end of the film, I could forgive this film for not blowing me away in that regard as there were enough strong elements in the film, characters and dialogue, to maintain my engagement. I think I wouldn't be this harsh to the film's action if I hadn't seen Joss Whedon's The Avengers, particularly its last half hour.\n\nThe film's score, like the action, couldn't stand against what Alan Silvestri has delivered in The Avengers, but Iron Man 3's musical score sound very typical to the genre and does its job well enough that it added a bit of depth and flavour to a couple of the film's scenes.\n\nThe actors in this film did their roles very well, particularly Robert Downey Jr. and Ben Kingsley. Downey was able to show us shades of the character that we haven't seen before, showing a sense of humanity that has been lacking in a couple of his films lately; I am so glad to see the actor in top form again. Kingsley brought a sense of menace to the role, something that felt close to what he delivered in Jonathan Glazer's Sexy Beast, then showing a slight change in the middle of the second act which was certainly a surprise and had me loving his performance even more. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, I felt, was a little under used here as most of the film's heart is found in Tony Stark. She was great when she appears on screen, but on the third act her performance felt lifeless, I am not sure whether or not the blame goes towards the actress or the director as at the same time she is given very little to speak during this section of the film. Though I may not be a huge fan of his role in this film, but Guy Pearce certainly delivered a strong performance, but his presence during the first act of the film felt a little fake and over-done. Rebecca Hall's role was minor, which is a shame as she has proven herself in previous films that she is a worthy actress.\n\nIron Man 3 is a strong comic-book film, though a little underwhelming in its action, it does provide a sufficient amount of character development and witty dialogue that it elevates above its sibling films. Also, this is certainly a film I would be watching regularly during Christmas seasons.",

The acting was as you'd expect for the genre and the cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Ben Kingsley.  \n\n\"You know what keeps going through my head?  Where's my sandwich?\"\n\nI was slightly disappointed by the last Iron Man picture and was hesitant to see this picture.  I actually feel the series has plateaued a little and this film didn't change my stance on this character.  I didn't feel there was enough action in this movie (compared to the more recent Thor, Avenger, and Captain America films) and I felt it could have been better.  This is worth watching but doesn't meet the greatness of the first Iron Man film or current Avenger pictures being released.\n\n\"I did that.\"\n\nGrade: B- (7.25)",

RDJ gives a superb charismatic performance as millionaire Tony Stark, he has made the character his own and has grown into the role so much. Ty Simpkins (Harley) is a refreshing change from the winey annoying child actors we are getting accustomed to, he has proved himself to be a very talented young actor. Other good performances come from Ben Kingsley, Guy Pearce and Gwyneth Paltrow. \nIron Man 3 has a shocking storyline full of twists and turns, it makes the film even more entertaining and it keeps you on your toes.\nThe film also has quite a lot of humour, I think this really reflects Tony Starks' hyper and bubbly personality.\nI love Iron Man because the storyline shows you how much emotional trauma Tony Stark is suffering from as a result of previous battles, something a Marvel movie has never gone so deep into before.\nDirector/Writer Shane Black has dona a great job at creating an impressive 3rd chapter in the Iron Man story.",

The story is nothing all that special, Guy Pearce is the villain, along with a very clever turn by Ben Kingsley as a middle eastern terrorist, but Downey is so good as the wise cracking Stark, that the film just crackles. Downey is particularly aided by terrific dialogue by director/co-writer Shane Black (\"Last Boy Scout\"/\"Lethal Weapon\"). Black previously directed Downey in the supremely underrated \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\" which although not a hit, I would argue revitalized Downey's career, showing off his leading man chops following a string of personal problems. There's also a solid supporting cast that includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Jon Favreau, Paul Bettany. I also found it pretty funny that two usually villainous character actors, William Sadler and Miguel Ferrer, were cast as the president and vice president of the United States. Overall, this film belongs to Downey and director Black. For me, it's more Black that came away from this film as the hero, directing and writing a successful major blockbuster. I really hope he get free reign like he did with \"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang\". Seriously, all of ya'll should go watch that film right now.",

The story took a twist which in many cases work but ended up pissing off the fan base. Then, the film becomes a normal action movie with great action scenes and no emotion as well as no character redemption. It was an upgrade over Iron Man 2 and I thought Shane Black did a creative job doing a superhero Lethal Weapon hybrid. It just ran out of steam at the end. 2.5 stars.

This particular aspect is bad in its own right, but, honestly, I think this movie's problem go far beyond that specific gripe that people have. My problem with this failure of film is its defective writing, poor conceptualization, dull characters, inconsistent tone, lack of intelligence and thematic integrity. Iron Failure 3 is as superficial and trivial as you can get. Depth in this movie is non-existent. Character motivation is flat. The characters themselves are poorly written cardboard figures with no personality. \n\nThere is no stakes and no tension. Everything is paint by numbers and generic. As for the controversial miss-handling of the main villain, which many defenders of this movie have described as an act of brilliancy, because it had some imaginary message behind it, I have my opinion on that.\n\nThe only hidden message that this movie gave us, is that Shane Black should never again direct another comic book movie. I guess people think about that meaningless plot-point too much. Iron Man 3 is not a Dark Knight, when you can write a book about all the subliminal meanings behind the film. Iron Man 3 is a cookie-cuter, generic, uninventive schlock. Maybe the idea behind this \"hidden message\" looked good in a concept, but the execution is what kills any potential for this to be taken seriously. It's like with the Prometheus, which had great ideas, but the execution of those ideas was flat and dull. Iron Man 3 was even worse than that. \n\nI am fully aware, as a few other people with actual brain cells, that this cheap option was not executed well and it didn't had the abstract meaning which maybe it originally intended to have.\n\nIron Man 3 is generic, cheesy, poorly written mess with no actual depth. If Shane Black, who is definitely not someone who has brilliant writing and directing skills, intended to mock the perception of terrorism in society, he would have an entire film dedicated on exploration of that. But he's too dumb and generic to actually make something good out of that concept. People are giving simply some generic excuses for the fact that Shane Black did very poor execution with the story and the conceptuality of the film (which it didn't really had). \n\nShane Black is the one who thinks that tasteless one-liners and dull action is more important than sophistication and inventiveness. He never wrote or direct a movie that really has something intellectually to offer. He wrote Last Action Hero, after all. That's says a lot about his style.?",

It had decent, well choreographed action where many things were happening simultaneously and still made sense. It was great.\n\nIt had strong character development - He was influenced from the events of the Avengers. That's why he had PTSD. It was a whole and complete movie, and that and Cap2 are the movies in the MCU that I can feel happy watching over and over again, because they don't leave loose ends, have a bit of everything and they are completely exciting.?\n\nI have a few thoughts on the villain. Filmmakers often think that a villain who can sympathize with the audiences is the best. Most do that too. But Iron Man 3 was bold. It's decision to go with a hate- able villain and actually pulling it off is a feat onto itself.\n\nI mean, his motivations were simple itself. Sell Extremis and gain money. The way he pulled it off and the filmmakers displayed it was remarkable. He created a fake persona, the Mandarin, and enabled him to create war and terror. This in turn would create widespread panic among this US, and coupled with the killing of the US president and literally controlling USA when it's vice president came to power, would cause the nation to crumble and allow him to gain a profit.\n\nKillian was counting on the media to stare at the Mandarin's face value, and blowing it out of proportion, when he was charge the whole time.\n\nThis was a very clever jab by Shane Black to the current hype created by the media by over blowing every threat, and turning every attack into a frenzy. \n\nNot to mention that it was a clever way of bringing back the post industrialist complex of Iron Man 1 and 2. The whole trilogy literally has a common and consistent theme. The post industrialist complex of evil businessmen and CEO's who could threaten the world, largely due to their immeasurable greed for money and power.\n\nThe message may not have been as clear as, say, the TDK trilogy, but it still stands, and its very popular in the contemporary world.\n\nOverall, this movie was amazing. I loved it. Best of the trilogy, and I hope that Iron Man returns.\n\n9.5/10",

Im glad they are possibly fixing this problem in later movies. Even though this movie has great special effects, Robert Downy Jr.'s acting and good action scenes, they don't save the film for its horrible twist and many other problems as well. The best way to describe Iron Man 3 is to describe it the way The Mandarin compared fortune cookies and America in the film, \"Hallow, full of lies, and leaves a bad taste in you mouth\".",

One thing that made me steer clear of watching this in the theater was the fact I had no idea what this movie was suppose to be about besides Iron Man. I have the same complaint for the movie itself except in a worse way I could have imagined. The villain in this film, Killian, was even a worse developed character than Whiplash in the last Iron Man. Except we knew why he was doing what he was doing. I could not figure out what was the overall outcome Killian wanted. There were characters that were just deliberately thrown in only never to be seen again both on screen and in the plot itself. I can literally tell you thousands of plot holes in this film, but I don't want to spoil anything. One thing though that absolutely pissed me off was the fact that Tony Stark has PTSD from what happened in The Avengers; WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!???????????????? IN THE FIRST IRON MAN HE WATCHED SOLDIERS BEING MURDERED WITH HIS OWN WEAPONS AND LOST A FRIEND HE HAD PROMISED TO SAVE YET HE DIDN'T GET IT THEN!!!!!!!! BUT SOME HOW HE GETS IT FROM A FUCKING ALIEN INVASION IN WHICH HE CAME OUT MOSTLY UNSCATHED!!!!!!!!

Iron Man 3 takes place after the events of The Avengers where Tony Stark is trying to live a peaceful life. But soon his life is now facing a new threat when a mysterious enemy known as the \"Mandarin\" is creating an army of extremis super soldiers and when he also learns of the kidnapping of his girlfriend Pepper Pots he must save the world and his girl from the danger that he is facing. I so love Iron Man 3 and I'm serious about it to be honest and it is better than Iron Man 1 and 2 any other Marvel movies like Thor 1 and 2 and lastly The Hulk films. One of the highlights of this movie is that the film itself is full of magnificent special and CGI effects and I'm serious the effects in this film are both satisfying and infinitely awesome. I love all of the effects in this film and my personal favorite special effect in this movie is the design of the extremis effects and all of the effects on the extremis soldiers are pure cool I mean it check out the scene where one of the extremis people blow up in the Chinese theater where Stark's friend and body guard gets critically injured or the scene where we see one of the people who becomes an extremis soldier gets her arm regenerated but the effects are well used in the finale of the movie. The other things I like about this film is that the movie has loads of non stop action scenes that are fun and extremely memorable(The first encounter with the extremis soldier of Mandarin, the attack at the bar and the outstanding finale where Iron Man calls all of his suits to fight Mandarin's army oh and I almost forgot to mention the best part of the film where Iron Man saves one of the President's friends in the airplane and the fight scene with Mandarin and Iron Man is superbly fun). While the last things I like about this film is that the movie's soundtrack is amazing and I love Brian Tyler's score for this film a lot the soundtrack is super cool in this film a lot. Now the acting is superbly awesome in this film. All of the returning casts including the new ones did a fantastic job with their performances in the film a lot. Robert Downey Junior did an amazing job with his performance as Iron Man once again and he seems to have exceed his performance in this film even though his character isn't as comical as before. Same can be said to Gwyneth Paltrow and Jon Favreau who both reprise their roles as Pepper Pots and Happy Hogan. Ty Simpkins did an amazing job with his performance as Iron Man's kid friend and I love his performance in this film outside of the Insidious movies. And Rebecca Hall and Guy Pearce did an amazing job with their performances as Maya and the main antagonist and Iron Man's worst enemy the Mandarin. But the most hilarious actor who delivers one of the most hilarious performances in movie history is Ben Kingsley who's character Trevor Slatery is super funny in the film if you thought that he was the bad guy in the first half because of his voice and menacing look then his performance in the last half became extremely hilarious which is what I consider as the funniest plot twists in movie history. Director Shane Black did an amazing job with his directing on this film and his directing is down to earth and pure awesome plus I love the way he worked on this film a lot he even showed his improvements in his directing over Jon Favreau's directing on the first two Iron Man movies I love his work so far. Overall Iron Man 3 is the best movie in the Marvel Universe and it is definitely on par with The Avengers, The Amazing Spider Man and Captain America: The Winter Soldier this movie is infinitely awesome. This film gets an 11/10. Iron Man 3 rocks!!!!!!",

Our main character still faces any obstacle with arrogance and it still is pretty enjoyable. Ben Kingsley finally brings the character of The Mandarin to the big screen and while the direction he takes is strange to say the least it was great for what it was.\n\n    In terms of the technology and fictional science used it just gets really stupid. Everything just seems like an excuse for a CGI red ball of fire to appear for no reason on screen. Powers and side-effects just appear and disappear and at one point it just becomes really stupid when somebody just spits fire out of nowhere. The visual effects are great and well-made but it can get a bit messy. While Shane Black knows how to create suspenseful action sequences, they become a bit unfocused and disorienting.\n\n       Iron Man 3 is messy stupid fun that sort of tries to be smart and thoughtful but nobody really believes that. The ending makes no sense as do some other parts of the movie, but somehow, someway it does feel like an okay entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",

He also gives his best one liners and overall comedic performance in this movie. Downey alone is worth seeing this movie. Reasons I disliked the movie, The Mandarin is supposed to be his arch enemy and they completely made Ben Kingsley a punch line when they revealed who he REALLY was. That plot twist was funny at first, but I couldn't take the rest of the movie seriously after that. And Guy Pearce is NOT villain material. The overall \"does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man\" question comes to full circle and honestly I don't know if it ever got answered. So he blows up all his suits and gets the metal removed from his chest, is Tony a better man because of that? Well, he seems to be more protective and supportive of Pepper than in his other two films so that's some character growth right there. It is not the best in the franchise, but it is a great showcase for Robert Downey Jr. as well as showcasing what Tony Stark can do outside the suit. Overall, see it for his performance, great action sequences and the score THE SCORE IS EPIC!!!",

I love Guy Pearce, he's such an underrated, character actor and it's always awesome just to watch him in anything 'coz he's just ubber talented. Of course, RDJ was wonderful in this one as well, I'm not so sure about amping Pepper from damsel to hero but I like the idea, just not entirely sure it was executed well enough. ***SPOILER ALERT*** I'm also on the fence about demoting the Mandarin from a major villain into a two-bit-drug-ridden actor but I do like the idea and enjoyed the twist-- it was a fresh approach, kind of interesting actually. Also, kudos to the little kid, Harley Keener (played by Ty Simpkins), he was adorable without being too sappy or overly cutesy. Well done! He was one of the more interesting characters in the film. As much as I love the suits, there was just too much of them in this movie, but understandably since there were so many of those darn fire-emitting-super-soldier-type henchmen guys, but the final showdown was just too busy. Also, I wished they'd bite the bullet and actually killed off Pepper-- that would have been an awesome surprised and a true turning point for Stark. Overall, like I said, this was still pretty entertaining and just another thread in the loom that would eventually lead to the next Avengers film.",

Iron Man 3 does accomplish a new direction which I am absolutely in love with. It has funny punchlines that come across every two minutes or so and the intensity is cranked up on high.

Not only do we get to see the characters we've come to really love back once again, with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and Don Cheadle as James Rodes/War Machine, but there are some neat additions to the franchise as well. This third film is actually an improvement on the second one, with a villain that really feels like he is able to not only match wits with Tony Stark but is able to match him when it comes to the firepower department as well. The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) feels like a genuine threat not only to Iron Man but also to War Machine (who is rebranded as \"Iron Patriot\" early in the film) and there are some genuine moments of tension where you really don't know how the good guys are going to get out of the pickle they've found themselves in.\nThe special effects are excellent and there are some scenes that are quite spectacular throughout. A particular standout is the film's climax where there are so many characters and effects flying around that it will take you several viewing to be able to even start grasping every element. Once again the action and thrills are well balanced with some good comedy, including a one-joke character that comes in towards the middle of the film and leaves quickly, but not before delivering a hilarious joke that fits so perfectly in this Marvel character's universe that it will be remembered for years (If you're trying to figure out who I'm referring to, let's just say it's a big fan of Tony Stark).\nEverything inside the film's story feels like it's a step up from where the franchise started. The technology in the Iron Man suit is more advanced and dazzling, the characters are richer and face odds that are greater, the villain is more threatening and the action is cranked up to anew level between the scenes of drama. There are also some good twists and turns throughout the story that will really catch you by surprise too. While you will probably have your doubts on whether or not it's possible for certain characters to actually die since they're part of such a big franchise, there are at the end of the film some big changes to the Iron Man series that will leave you a bit emotional and have you cheering for more too. Once again, make sure you stick all the way to the end of the credits of the film (for a quick scene that is a lot of fun) and watch out for a cameo from Stan Lee that's very funny. The 3-D effects are quite good (there are a couple of scenes where ash is falling all around the characters that's particularly well done) and during the action sequences there is debris flying everywhere so on the big screen it's a ton of fun to see. \"Iron Man 3\" is exactly what you want in a three-quel (if that's a word) to a successful and satisfying franchise and it really delivers.

This third instalment, and the start of Avengers Phase 2, sees Stark suffering from panic attacks and a lack of sleep because of the wormhole in New York. Robert Downey Jr. is on fine form as expected and Tony Stark is far more vulnerable this time, it seems all these big budget movies like to make their protagonists weak (Skyfall, Dark Knight Rises), so they can build themselves and fight back, although it's getting a bit tiresome now. Iron Man takes one hell of a beating, and there's not much reliance on the suit this time around so Iron Man 3 proves you don't need a suit to be a hero. Gwyneth Paltrow is undoubtedly one of the most talented and hottest actresses, and seeing her fight and use the suit is absolutely brilliant. Don Cheadle is in nearly every action scene, he's awesome and very funny too, yet again the talent is being used in all departments. Rebecca Hall is fantastic, and her characters holds a twist that will take you by surprise, and she has great chemistry with Potts. Guy Pearce is a convincing bad guy, he's merciless and cunning, but doesn't stand as high as Loki who is still the bad guy to beat. Sir Ben Kingsley's performance is something to behold, I'm not giving away any spoilers but I guaranteed you'll be so shocked, and amused. This is knockout entertainment, and one of the best Superhero movies in recent memory.",

I would have preferred a little more Tony in the suit kicking some ass than what we were given, but I thought the action was pretty solid in this movie, and I understand that we were learning that Tony Stark is more than just his suit of powered armor. Also this movie had a great twist in it regarding the villain, without spoiling anything, I thought that was one of the best parts of it. Although I know that is an unpopular opinion.

            "content": "Iron Man 3 is one of my favorite films of 2013. I'm a huge fan of the first Iron Man. It's one of my favorite superhero movies. Robert Downey, Jr. was fantastic as Tony Stark and as Iron Man. Iron Man 2 is a very good sequel although nowhere near as great as the first film. Of course, everybody knows that Marvel's The Avengers is my all-time favorite superhero movie. IM3 totally exceeded my expectations and is my favorite of the Iron Man trilogy. \n\nIron Man 3 involves Tony Stark, now with post-traumatic stress disorder after the events of The Avengers, as he's now bitten in the ass due to his obsession of building all these Iron Man suits and using them save the world and him being the biggest asshole in the world back in 1999, on New Year's Eve. So he has to figure out how to fix this shit all by himself while coming face-to-face with the evil terrorist, The Mandarin. \n\nWhen I heard Jon Favreau was stepping down as director, I was worried this was gonna suck. But then I heard Shane Black was gonna be directing the film and co-writing the script with Drew Pearce. I cheered. Shane Black wrote Lethal Weapon 1 and 2, The Monster Squad, The Last Boy Scout, Last Action Hero, The Long Kiss Goodnight, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (which he also directed). With a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as flawless as that, there was no way I was gonna be let down by Iron Man 3. \n\nThe story, the tightly-written characters, the witty dialogue, the direction, and of course, the action and effects, are done the most well here and there was more conflict this time around. This was a very personal story for Tony Stark and it works perfectly. Shane Black went very deep into Tony's psyche and conjured up something special not only for Iron Man fanboys, but for common moviegoers as well. \n\nWe're reminded that while Tony is a genius billionaire alcoholic playboy philanthropist, he's anything but perfect. He's made several mistakes during his past just like any other human being has. His greatest strength is his intelligence, not saving the world. His greatest achievement is his relationship with Pepper Potts, not building the Iron Man suits. Even without the suit, Tony is still Iron Man. The man makes the suit, not the other way around. This tone works brilliantly in this film. \n\nNow, let's get to the action. The action sequences and special effects are fucking awesometacular. I was vastly entertained by them. Not only does this film have the best action of the three Iron Man films, but also has the best climax. Now, some people would say that the climax is basically Transformers 4, but come on, you all know it was awesome. The effects are very impressive, even without the work of Industrial Light & Magic onboard. The action is shot beautifully by cinematographer John Toll, and Shane Black never lets the story overshadow the action or let the action overshadow the story, and he never wastes the audience's time. \n\nNow, I gotta talk about this real quick: the villain is first believed to be the Mandarin, but over an hour into the movie, it's revealed that the Mandarin was a persona created by Aldrich Killian of AIM and the person portraying the Mandarin is drunken British actor Trevor Slattery, played by Ben Kingsley. All the fanboys were pissed off at this twist. If you're not a fan of the twist, that's fine. I have no problem. I have read some issues of Iron Man. The ones I read had the Mandarin. He sucks. He's just an irritating racially-insensitive Wang Chung stereotype, and he's supposed to be Iron Man's arch-nemesis? Yeah, there's no way in hell you're gonna get me to buy that. The twist was ingenious, and the film gets better beyond that. As a plus, the twist provides social commentary on modern-day terrorists that works very well. \n\nThe performances are absolutely fantastic. Robert Downey, Jr. doesn't play Tony Stark/Iron Man. He IS Tony Stark/Iron Man. He absolutely fucking owns this role, and this would have to be Downey's best performance of his career. Gwyneth Paltrow is given a much bigger role this time around as Pepper Potts and she's given more to do, and she's more than just a damsel in distress. Guy Pearce does a wonderful job playing Aldrich Killian. Killian is a great villain whose motives make perfect sense. Don Cheadle does a great job as Rhodey and is given a lot more to do. \n\nFINAL SCORE: 10/10 \n\nI was more than satisfied with this movie. I loved how Shane Black took Tony Stark back to his roots, demonstrating his genius and never at all derailing from the story at hand. The action sequences are brilliantly filmed, the music score by Brian Tyler was just wonderful and outstanding, the villains are the best in this trilogy of films, the twist was ingenious and unpredictable, and Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man indeed. I loved this film. It's definitely on my top 15 of the year.",

The reason being is that it decides to take the focus away from Iron Man and more on the psyche of Tony Stark.  The Mandarin isn't his only nemesis in this film, but he also has to face his biggest challenge of all: his sudden sense of mortality.  This is not the same Tony that we've seen in the first two films and The Avengers.  This is a Tony Stark who is afraid that he is an inferior man without the Iron Man suit and feels like he isn't strong enough to protect the only people that he cares deeply for.  While I understand why so many people are upset with how The Mandarin is portrayed in this film, let me start off by saying that fans of the source material have every right to be upset... but ONLY the fans of the source material.  Take it from a guy who has never read any of the comic books... just pretend for a moment that you have no knowledge of a comic series that these films are based on.  Just go in and watch the movie... judge it for yourself.  That's exactly what I did, and as far as The Mandarin goes, yeah, I will admit, I was a little bummed, but not to the extreme like the comic fans were.  The final battle during the film's climax is hands down the absolute best battle / fight scenes out of all the Iron Man films, bar none!  Overall, this is a fantastic movie with a good story, great character development, great action, and a stellar performance by the same cast, including the new ones!  Check this out!",

Performances were first-rate.\n\nIron Man 3 is no exception.  In fact, I enjoyed it slightly more than the previous two.  Tony Stark showed a vulnerability that wasn't evident in the first two.  Plus, in the Mandarin and Guy Pearce's character we have a villain who is a match for Iron Man.\n\nOn this note, Guy Pearce put in a great performance as the bad guy.  Usual great, snappy, witty performance from Robert Downey Jr. \n\nGreat entertainment.",

The action was great like always but the main villain was rather underwhelming and not a big name anyone will have heard of (except for big time comic book followers).  They blended in the Avengers a little with talk about them but no special cameos were made.

            "content": "The best Marvel movie since the original \"Iron Man,\" Shane Black's \"Three\" uses Jungian psychology as a framework for superhero action and actually makes it work. There's a real evolution of Stark as a character, as well as the Iron Man concept itself (where do potential sequels go from here?) that your average Hollywood franchise would be utterly terrified of approaching. Downey Jr. and Paltrow continue to deepen the relationship between Tony and Pepper as well; it feels genuine and unique (a stark-- no pun intended-- contrast to the generic lovey-dovey nonsense of Thor and Jane Foster). The late attempt to transform Pepper into a super-powered fighter is rather silly though (A female character being forcibly given super-abilities by the villain is not empowering, no matter how many cool backflip kicks she does). Cheadle, Pearce, and Kingsley are great. Rebecca Hall is underused.\n\n\"Iron Man Three\" has some plotting issues (like watching Tony go through the motions of investigating the Chinese Theater explosion even though we, as an audience, already know what's going on), but it contains the most jaw-dropping plot twist I've seen in years. The main villains motivations are also a bit ho-hum, and the moment with the kid's workshop at the end is a bit twee (even as his early interactions with Tony were refreshingly absent of sap), but these are somewhat minor issues in an otherwise well-constructed narrative.\n\nI think what's really worth celebrating is the unique, character-driven nature of the action-sequences in the film, such as the Barrel-of-Monkeys bit (which seriously gets my heart thumping), and the delightful hardware-tools mansion siege. Even during the bigger, explosion-heavy CGI-fests (like the final battle), we get some the interesting mind-controlled-armor mechanics that lend a creativity to the action beyond simple punching and shooting.",

The film has a darker mood to it that makes everything feel a little more real, in that Christopher Nolan feel.\n\nThe dialogue in this movie was also great.  Some may find Stark's jokes cheesy, but I think for a damaged character like him, it works.\n\nOne complaint that I've heard about the movie is how there's less Iron Man and more Tony Stark, similar to the Bruce Wayne Batman ratio in The Dark Knight Rises.  For Iron Man 3, which is the story of Tony Stark following The Avengers, the lack of Iron Man makes sense.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that Iron Man 3 is exactly what Marvel intends when making a superhero film: to chronicle one of their characters.

            "content": "Spoilers in this review\n\nIron Man 3 is a film that I feel was let down by the fantastic marketing. The outstanding trailers for this movie promised us a dark story that delved into Tony Starks anxiety after the events of the first Avengers while he went up against his most challenging villain yet. However what we got is a mediocre, forgettable and goofy movie. Just like in all Marvel movies the acting is brilliant Robert Downey Jr steals the show as usual. Gwenyth Paltrow, Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle, Ben Kingsley, Rebecca Hall and Jon Favreau are all excellent. There are some really good jokes in the movie, the bit where Tony Stark calls the little kid a pussy is really funny. The action is phenomenal. The mansion raid scene while very illogical is great as is the plane rescue scene. The final action sequence is brilliant unlike in the previous two movies. I also think the last 40 minutes of the film are ridiculously entertaining. The Mandarin is set up brilliantly I love the creepy news footage and he's very menacing in these bits. I also feel the anxiety is handled excellently in the first half. However this film has a lot of bad. The biggest and most obvious one is the handling of the Mandarin. As I've said the Mandarin is handled fantastically at the start of the movie however after he blows up his house and pushes him to breaking point, Tony Stark invades the mandarins mansion with homemade weapons, he reaches the Mandarins bedroom and he comes out of the toilet having just taken a huge shit and we get the stupid reveal that Ben Kingsley is infant a British actor who only portrays the mandarin on the tv and instead Guy Pearce is infact the Mandarin. This is a really stupid move as they had brilliantly set up Ben Kingsley and then just did a huge cop out and made him an annoying drunk druggie actor. Another problem is Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian or the mandarin, he has a terrible motivation, infact it's the same as Snydrome from the Incredibles or Electro from the Amazing Spiderman 2. While the extremist idea could have worked really well it doesn't and it's laughably hilarious to see Guy Pearce breath fire. Another huge problem is that after Happy Hogan is injured in an explosion caused by 'the Mandarin' Tony gives out his address on the news and the Mandarin attacks in helicopters and blow up the house. However Tony does nothing to stop them or set up any defense when he has around forty suits under his house ready to defend him. I love the plane scene and it's the best part of the film however it is revealed at the end that Tony Stark wasn't in the suit as a lorry hits the suit when he is flying away and it breaks into a million pieces. This brings up two problems as it cheapens the scene as all Tony was doing was sitting in a room and just controlling through a head set. Also in the first movie the Iron Man Armour took a tank missile and didn't break, in the second movie it took Whiplash's electric whips and didn't break, in the Avengers it took Thor's Lightning and didn't break, in this movie a lorry breaks it. All the suits in this film are terrible it's like they're made out of tissues and paper plates. They also fake our Pepper dying which is just pointless. Ty Simpkins (the kid from Insidious) is in the film and while he's good he fairly pointless and slows down the movie. I also think Killian is a terrible villain, he's very unthreatening and has awful motivation. I also hate how when he finally gets a bit badass and yells 'I am the mandarin' he's immediately hit off screen and killed a by Pepper. Tony has anxiety T the start of the movie however it's suddenly forgotten about half way through. I also feel they tried to wrap up this film to neatly, with Iron Man blowing up all his suits and being able to fix himself. You see Shane Black directed this film well however it feels like he wanted to make a action comedy movie with Robert Downey Jr and then had to put Iron Man in it, because as a buddy comedy movie this works, as an Iron Man movie it doesn't. The Unfortunately there are a lot of flaws and it's definatley one of the weakest marvel movies. I will say it's better than Iron Man 2 and Thor the Dark World, but it's nowhere near perfect. However it made.a lot of money. See it if you want but there are so many Marvel movies better than it. B-",

The humor works in the first five minutes or so, but after that, the humor is just plain stupid. The action is even kind of let down. I think the best thing in this movie would have to be the acting, good performances by an A+ cast. I wasn't a huge fan of Iron Man or Iron Man 2, just because of their lack of originality, and being a fan of the comics I really felt like the ruined the villains and that's exactly what they did with this one two and it really disappointed me because the Mandarian is my favorite Iron Man villain. Robert Downey Jr. was the perfect choice for Tony Stark though, his performance was incredible, I could not see anyone else doing the series, and his performance may be my favorite in the avengers.",

            "content": "Man, it's a terrible shame that Tony Stark didn't call in some help from Bruce Banner, played once again by Edward Norton, as Norton has always said that he wants to fight Gandhi. ...You know, because the antagonist in this is played by Ben Kingsley... and Norton's character in \"Fight Club\" said he would fight Gandhi. Sorry for that, people, it's just that I can't help but think of \"Fight Club\" when I see a Shane Black film and think about how much \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was like a Chuck Palahniuk story, which is actually pretty amazing, because as good as a \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" is, it came out so long ago that it's hard to remember. Yeah, I should be a little careful with statements like, \"when I see a Shane Black film...\", because \"a\" could insinuate that there is, in fact, more than one Shane Black film in existence. Oh hey, now there is, because \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" was one of Robert Downey, Jr.'s big comeback films, thus, Downey owes Black a favor, which is cool for me, because Black has been missed for a reason since 2005, even though I do miss Jon Favreau as director. Hey, he understood that he had to pass the torch, because as \"Iron Man 2\" told us, he was getting rusty with his handling of this subject matter... or at least that's what's being said by everyone other than me, that one jerk who actually liked \"Iron Man 2\" better than the first \"Iron Man\"... and thought Chris Nolan's \"Dark Knight\" series was underwhelming, up until \"The Dark Knight Rises\"... and thinks that \"Watchmen\" is a masterpiece. Yeah, I've never been the person you need to look to if you want recommendations for a superhero film, but I can at least agree with the consensus that the first \"Iron Man\" is better than this installment, which is decent, sure, but messy.\r\n\r\nAs a writer, Shane Black really knew what he was doing with the tongue-in-cheek \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\", but here, whether it be the fault of co-writer Drew Pearce or whatever, his writing style not only doesn't work as well as it probably should, but feels under-inspired in certain areas, carrying a certain cheesiness, both within the sometimes obnoxiously forced humor, and within the often near-aggravatingly histrionic drama, neither of which are consistent enough with the cheesiness to prevent tonal inconsistencies that break what tension there is with much too much fluff. They don't even break out the Marvel Studios title card before giving you a little peak at Tony Stark's lab getting destroyed, in slow-motion, to a deeply dramatic score and a narrating Stark quoting a profound proverb regarding man's downfall by his own mistakes, before humorously questioning the proverb and losing his train of thought, until he is finally silenced by Eiffel 65's \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\", and those first few seconds of this film, alone, really warn you that this isn't going to be nearly as serious as it probably should be, and as sure as sunshine, tonal unevenness that still isn't inconsistent enough to keep fluffiness from being way too prominent really undercuts much of the bite of this film, much like pacing unevenness. Even pacing is all over the place, with developmental lapses marking heights in the questionability of the rushing that is generally simply obnoxious, while the 130-minute runtime is largely reached through repetitious excesses in material that get to be so overblown that they don't simply taint storytelling with aimlessness, but bloat the overall narrative concept. None of the \"Iron Man\" installments have been all that tight, but this story concept feels particularly bloated something fierce, with too many subplots and story branches to keep up with without focal inconsistencies, even on paper, without tonal and pacing inconsistencies found in the execution of a convolutedly overblown story that isn't even refreshing. This film may hit some flaws not usually hit by superhero opuses this high in profile so severely, but outside of that and a few more flattering storytelling elements, there's nothing new here, and such shameless genericism and overall predictability make what is conceptually an important addition in the mythology for this film series feel barely consequential. I was expecting, or at least hoping for anything from a rewarding blockbuster to the best \"Iron Man\" installment yet, but in the end, the film is nothing short of a mess that never loses decency, but slips, little by little, under the weight of misguided incoherencies and a degree of inconsequentiality, until the final product sputters out as, of all things, the most underwhelming \"Iron Man\" yet. Of course, even though it falls short of substance, as sheer blockbuster fluff, this film delivers as thoroughly entertaining, complete with some pretty impressive style.\r\n\r\nJust like most every other effort by one of everyone's favorite formulaic blockbuster score composers, Brian Tyler, this film's original soundtrack is highly convention, but it's still pretty strong, with a lively sweep, punctuated by subtly gripping intensity that sustains entertainment value, while John Toll's cinematography further supplements the liveliness, not necessarily with as much of the rich coloration and crisp lighting that they keep showing off in the well-polished marketing campaigns, but with some very stylish camera tricks that immerse, at least as technically impressive, even if they're not nearly as impressive as the visual effects. If nothing else meets expectations, it is, of course, the amazingly well-rendered and delightfully creative effects that, this time around, grace the screen most of the time, and dazzle consistently, especially in the heat of action whose staging ranges from thoroughly fun in its grandness, to tensely tight, but never falls short on uniquely entertaining dynamics, anchored by remarkable technical proficiency. Style is strong and technicality is absolutely outstanding, just as I expected, even if substance isn't what I was hoping for, and yet, even then, it's not like substance is completely misguided. I find it difficult to fully stress just how overblown this film's story concept is, yet there are plenty of intriguing fluffy, dramatic and even thematic elements for Drew Pearce's and Shane Black's script to do injustice with unevenness in pacing, focus and tone, in addition to conventions and cheesiness, until admittedly delivering on some colorful dialogue and humor, if not engaging dramatic elements that are brought to life by Black's direction. Tone is all over the place, but it's sold pretty effectively by lively, when not reasonably intense storytelling, so for every mistake Black makes, he shows yet more potential as a blockbuster filmmaker, although that's not to say that the onscreen blockbuster stars in this film do just as solid, if not a more solid job of selling things the best that they can. If nothing else outside of the aesthetic blockbuster material has been consistent in delivering, it's been the acting, and even with acting material's being particularly thinned out in this particularly dramatically underwhelming installment in the \"Iron Man\" saga, the strong performances remain, with just about everyone across the board offering chemistry and charisma, especially leading man Robert Downey, Jr., who steals the show as surely as he always does with an effortless display of sizable charm and subtle layers that bring more depth to the iconic Tony Stark character than this script. This film is a whole lot more superficial than I was expecting or hoping it would be, and even with that taken out of account, the many flaws here challenge the memorability of the final product, but the patient will no doubt find a thoroughly fun blockbuster and reasonably worthy third installment in the \"Iron Man\" film series, no matter how much it falls short of its potential.\r\n\r\nWhen it's time to retire the suit once again, exhausting inconsistencies in tone, pacing and focus to the telling of a convolutedly overblown, yet still generic and superficial story concept wear down the final product, until it collapses, not just into underwhelmingness, but as the relative weakest installment in the \"Iron Man\" series thus far, though not so deeply that sharp scoring and photography, amazing effects and action, reasonably colorful writing and charismatic acting - especially from Robert Downey, Jr., of course - aren't enough to drive \"Iron Man 3\" as a fun, if highly flawed blockbuster.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

It did a fantastic job of dealing with the trauma that Tony felt after fighting off the aliens in New York, and it also took the Iron Man suit away from Tony for a time, reminding us that he is more than the armor that he built. And I loved that Pepper got a bigger role, this time around. Always happy to see Gwyneth get more screen time:)",

After the second movie, I was worried that like the Transformers movies, there would be such a perfect first instalment that the other simply could not reach its level. I was wrong, and gladly too. Iron Man 3 is by far one of the best Marvel movies out there and is a top all rounder. From the one liners to the unfamiliar feeling of desperation for Tony Stark. The fiery AIM's weapons feel like they have been deprived from Terminators, they are fantastic and make great enemies to all of Starks suits, MK1 to 42. Iron Man 3 is an exhilarating joy ride.

Starting off, I'm getting straight to the point, you made The Mandarin being an actor, he is just a comedian, you made Iron Man's arch-nemesis being a comedian in the movie, we had a bad surprise, why did you guys make him like that? You should have looked into the script twice. It's like saying The Joker being a clown in the end, or making Bane be like how Bane was in Batman and Robin. Its that stupid. The second thing that is wrong with this movie is that there is too much humour in it. It's like you guys turned this into a kid's movie. The point is to make these movies good and not a kid's fest, and they're supposed to be dark and realistic. Make this movie like Iron Man 1, should focus on a lesson behind it, have some humour in it, but don't make it a comedy, then make the genre comedy, but you won't have a lot of people watching it. Don't make false advertisements and the trailers looked better than this movie, it was worse seeing the movie itself. Then the movie surprises you with Aldrich Kilian saying \"You looking for the Mandarin, I AM THE MANDARIN\" which is to not make the audience feel bad, and it still didn't work, Aldrich Kilian is NOT the Mandarin, he is still Aldrich Kilian, he's basically saying he's behind it all by saying he's \"the Mandarin\" So the mistake is you shall learn from that because I am not happy with this movie. I want to enjoy Iron Man but with it started going down the road after the first movie!",

            "content": "Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark in Iron Man 3; that's pretty much it. In this over-hyped, underwhelmed sequel to Iron man 2, which I would like to forget (i'm looking at you as well, Spiderman 3), Marvel decided to cash in on the franchise's popularity and deliver a decent movie, at best. Firstly, the plot is just out-right ridiculous. There are a lot of action movies that have a C plot at most in order to push the story forward to give the movie chances to showcase action scenes for the audience. Now while Iron Man 3 does this, the plot was so unbearable that I wasn't even interested in seeing the action scenes. The plot was all over the place with no sense of coherency and it was just uninteresting. The main villain? No sense of motivation, anti-climactic and was just a face for the movie to have a final confrontation and ridiculous 'love triangle', if you want to call it that. And I feel like secondary character barely got more than 5 minutes screen time; they were just there to push the plot (or lack thereof) along.\n\t What marvel tried to do was show another side of the Tony's character; a more human side. They could have done very well with this, especially considering that  lot of comics have source material, which is another reason why the lackluster effort was so disappointing. He's suffering from PTSD from the events of the Avenger's movie, which again, is a great idea, but it's handled so sub-par. You have a few moments where he gets anxiety attacks but it's never really explored or dealt with. They do the whole hollywood blockbluster sense of 'hero is needed and ergo, gets over issues off screen'. In the comics, it's riveting how Tony gets over his issues; you see despite his arrogance, he's actually vulnerable and it's just a front because the world's always watching him. Ever since the end of Iron man when he announced it, i've never gotten this feeling. This brings me to the performances. Downey owns iron man; that's pretty much a given, minus a few really forced scenes here and there and Palthrow as Pepper, well, they could have done worse. The only person who has great screen time and wasn't given enough was Cheadle; he had comedic timing and some really great one liners. I will admit though, that there were a few moments where Downey and Palthrow's screen time was sweet and found a way to show Stark's vulnerability as previously mentioned, even if a little. \n\tThe action, was a mixed bag. Already having discussed the reason for plot, I found myself not looking forward to them at all, but then in my surprise, actually enjoying them when they were played out. But by the time I did, they were finished, minus the final confrontation, which even I have to admit was really entertaining. The special effects were okay but I saw no need for 3D, as usual, since it was just served as a gimmick and ticket price increase. But that's pretty much it; no substance, no special moment that i'll remember or take from this movie. After movies like the Nolan's Batman franchise, Amazing Spiderman and the Avenger's for crying out loud, standards for superhero movies are sky high, and Iron man 3 just didn't soar at all. This is going to be down the middle though; Iron Man 3 was one of those movies that either you really liked or you really hated, depending on your taste, so I don't expect everyone to agree, but it's just my opinion.\n\t Decent performances due to a horrible script (minus the ridiculous villain) with some okay action scenes but plain, nonsensical plot which made the movie even more unbearable. 4/10.",

Well, in the first Iron Man sequel we tried to explore just how Tony Stark copes with being a hero and going through intense trauma. Unfortunately he dealt with it by regressing back to the jerk that he was at the beginning of the original Iron Man. This made him unlikable. Here, though, we get a bit more likable and believable version of that. Robert Downey Jr. is still very good in his role, fully immersing himself into the role of Tony Stark. You buy that this is a man that has too much burden on his shoulders, but who still tries to do what is best for the ones he loves.\n\nWe also get to see him struggling with the fact that being a hero takes its toll on you, like we saw in The Dark Knight Rises. I like this version better, because it's a bit more logical progression instead of hitting us from the blindside. And by the end of the film we achieve closure in a much more realistic way than we did in Nolan's version. Furthermore, the special effects are still some of the best you've ever seen, the visual style is very pleasing and it has some of that same humour that made the first one so enjoyable.\n\nUnfortunately this movie falters when it comes to its villains and side characters. Well, new side characters, because the returning ones are still more than serviceable. Gwyneth Paltrow is still an excellent Petter Potts. The villains however, are both bland and unlikable. They start pretty intriguing and you can see the potential, but then the movie decides to zick when it should zack, and the whole cardhouse comes crumbling down. I also absolutely loathed the kid sidekick that they decided to throw in, seemingly at the last minute. Yes, a kid sidekick, in a Marvel movie. You can see the problem, right?\n\nNevertheless, this is not a bad film, in the end. It's not nowhere near as good as the first one, but it's better than the second one. If you have liked the Marvel movies so far, you won't be disappointed.",

Also the last line of Iron Man 1 was simply one of the best ways to close a movie in recent years.  This one exceeds it, however, in great effects and also in witty dialogue.  It's amazing that they were able to keep an already 3-movie character so fresh with a simple simultaneous breakdown of his psychology and technology.\r\n\r\nIn Iron Man 3, Tony Stark faces a brilliant researcher who he sort of brushed off in the past, only to have it bite him in the butt years later.  This is one of my gripes in the film, because the villain is almost a carbon copy of Jim Carrey's Riddler.  While this is a far superior movie overall, the theme is a bit tired.  Also in this movie, Tony's repertoire of suits gets dealt a massive blow, making him essentially have to work from scratch for much of the film (reminiscent of his cave time in Iron Man 1).  Oh yeah, and he's had a sudden onset of panic attacks stemming from the events of The Avengers, which is one of the greatest parts of this movie.  It realistically portrays how shell-shocked a normal human would be when thrown into a situation of gods and alternate dimensions.\r\n\r\nSome of the special effects are astounding in this film.  The most notable in my mind being a scene where he rescues falling people.  This scene was filmed with real actors instead of CGI, which makes it grab your attention all the more and glue you to the seat edge.\r\n\r\nThe plot of Iron Man 3 may not be incredibly original, but the way individual scenes unfold is almost always unexpected, which makes a movie way more entertaining.  Overall, this movie surprised me with just how good a third film can be, and speaks to the increasing quality of sequels in our growing age of information where bad reviews reach the public instantly.  Hopefully this trend continues.",

The tone of this movie feels so different from the first two movies. And even though the movie is quite an improvement over the second movie, it does not come even an inch close to the first one.\r\n The flaws in this movie are way too many, but so are the strengths. First of all, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man is as good as ever. Just like The Dark Knight Rises, we see more of Tony Stark and less of Iron Man. At a point, Stark has to start from scratch and do things- at this point he is almost alone and helpless. You get to see the genius side of Stark which was not shown one bit in the second movie.\r\n Coming to the villains, we have Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian- who reminded me of Jim Carrey as The Riddler. As the movie progressed, I could still not make up my mind about how I felt about his character. The fault lies not in the acting, but the villian feels too much of a cartoon character, rather than a comic book hero villian.\r\n Ben Kingsley knocks it out of the park as The Mandarin. Or does he? Mandarin's story arch is probably the most controversial thing about this movie- some might love, some might hate it, and some might even be a bit confused as to what they feel about it. Its been roughly a year since the movie came out, and I still cannot confirm completely how I feel about this movie. \r\n The movie also feels really inconsistent at times. There are a lot of times when there is a lot of things packed into one and you don't really know what the movie really wants to convey. \r\n This movie is definitely the most serious and darkest of all the Iron Man movies- Black takes a route which is quite different from the previous two installments.\r\n All in all, if you are a comic book hero fan, or just a casual movie watcher, Iron Man could be the movie which satisfies you every bit, or it could be the movie whose existence is questioned by you. It's definitely not a movie which will appeal to all>",

It is good to see all the returning characters, but they do feel a little played down compared to the over the topness of how they have been portrayed before.  The action is just a frantic as you would expect, but there does seem to be a bit of a lack of Iron Man himself, and when he does appear you do feel a little cheated.  All in all, this is still a good movie, but it does have a completely different feel from the previous two entries, and it is nowhere as comic book as we have come to expect from the franchise.

In TN with no wallet, Jarvis offline, don't wanna involve Pepper or Rhodes. Coulson dead. Can't call Fury, Hawkeye or Widow because they're not in the script. smh It's a shame too. Even a nameless SHIELD agent would've been better than that FUCKING KID!!!\n\n7. The Axis of EVIL! Political satire! I love it! Ben Kingsley's Osama bin Laden...I mean Mandarin was WOOOOOOW\n\n6. Pepper's red hair may be gone but at least they didn't nerf her. By the 3rd installment of Star Wars, all Padme did was blink and cry.\n\n5. What is the airspeed of those damn suits?? They got from Malibu to Miami in like 30 minutes didn't they??? And parts of the suit are powered and work independently? by anyone?!?! You'd think they'd have retina scan security. I'm just saying...\n\n4. It never occurred to me one could get PTSD when they won the fight. Tony didn't even have PTSD when he had an ARC reactor installed in his chest to save him from the shrapnel in his heart that he got from being blown out of the funvee and held captive in a cave. He already didn't like to be handed things, now panic attacks. It's like \"how neurotic can we make Tony Stark. We need something on the level of Spiderman whiny\". Thank goodness he's the star of the movie and will always win because if he ever lost, he'd eat a repulsor blast.\n\n3. No more script writing for Shane Black or Drew Pearce PLEASE! Arm chair psychology kids. There is no coming back from that.\n\n2. For a former playboy, Tony is more communicative and committed to his relationship than I thought he'd be. No learning curve in his committed relationship attempt. He's all in. The first time. \n\n1. I LIKED THE BUNNY! I would've sprayed it with Tony's cologne and been found cuddling with it when Tony wasn't home. I guess I'm goofy like that *kanye shrug*\n\nOne star for the skydiving. 1/2 for Iron Patriot. 1/2 star for Guy Pearce and 1/2 for Don Cheadle. He grew on me. 1/2 star for the BUNNY!!",

This is in part thanks to a young boy who teams up with him, and Stark sees a little of himself in the child. The movie is pretty well written, with funny one liners throughout, though some of the dialogue comes off as cheesy. The Mandarin is a formidable antagonist, and despite the controversial turn his character takes, it was an unexpected twist that adds to the film. The climax is a lot of fun, and the story conclusively ends for Iron Man. The action is awesome and Robert Downey Jr. is as talented as ever. The villains felt a bit underdeveloped and the plot was flimsy at times. The action is fantastic but the storytelling is a bit oddly structured. However, we get to see that it is the man that makes the suit in this third Iron Man. Iron Man 3 gets 3.5/5 (B).",
