David (Will Forte) reluctantly embarks on a road-trip with his father, Woody (Bruce Dern), from Billings, MT to Lincoln, NE \u2014 Woody believes he has won $1,000,000 and is determined to retrieve it at the magazine headquarters in Nebraska. Even by the end credits, we still don't get a comprehensive beat on Woody. He's stubborn or senile or both. David, and to a lesser extent his mother (June Squibb) and brother (Bob Odenkirk), enable but also criticize and feel for Woody in the way only one can as they witness their spouse/parent near the end. The vast majority of the plot takes place in Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, NE, where there's little opportunity and everyone knows everyone else. When word gets out that Woody is a newly minted millionaire, despite how ridiculous that sounds to the rest of the Grant family, the closets are opened and the tithing hands are outstretched, from family and friend alike. Cole (Devin Ratray) and Bart (Tim Driscoll), Woody's nephews, are hilarious. June Squibb is a firecracker and vivified foil to Woody's humdrum reserve. \"I told 'em, \u2018I ain't fiddlin' with no cow titties, I'm a city girl',\" was her best moment. There's something here about pursuing an unreachable dream in this section of the country, but I don't think that's what you should come for. This is a heartfelt movie that avoids schmaltziness and includes real, if not ridiculous, characters.",

Everything about it is just perfect in my eyes, and I'm hoping it will crop up at some point on TV so I can wax lyrical about it some more. Payne followed this up with The Descendants (2011) another terrifically focused piece of film making, before making Nebraska, the story of an old man and his son. Bruce Dern plays Will Forte's father, who receives a letter in the post telling him he has won a million dollars in a publishing sweepstake, and is foiled by his family in his repeated attempts to walk himself to collect his winnings. Despite knowing it's a scam, son Davey (Forte) eventually agrees to drive his father to the state capital to prove this. What follows is a poignant, beautifully written, and laugh out loud road trip, elegantly shot in arty monochrome which adds to the period feeling of the movie in the sense that it's set in the here and now, but it feels like your watching something out of time. It's magical.",

Thus begins Nebraska, Alexander Payne's poignant tale filled with small moral victories and meaningful personal revelations.  The film, shot in stark and somber black and white, is a touching exploration of one man's deeply flawed character and his attempt at some sort of redemption.  Dern is excellent in the lead role, as is June Squibb as his crusty, painfully truthful wife.  Her scene in the cemetery is a comedic tour-de-force.",

            "content": "Bruce Dern is an actor that I associate with over the top method performances as seen in Coming Home (1978) and The King of Marvin Gardens (1972). It was a shock then to see him give a restrained, subtle performance as a sad older man instead of playing an angered war veteran or an extrovert gang member. Alexander Payne draws impressive performances out of actors as shown by the work of Virginia Madsen in Sideways (2004), Reese Witherspoon in Election (1999) and Swoosie Kurtz in Citizen Ruth (1996) and he provides us with one of Dern's greatest performances here. If there is any reason to watch this film it is the central performance as the rest of the film has the odd quality of seeming like a filmed play.\n\nThe elderly war veteran Woody Grant, Bruce Dern, believes that he has won a million dollars due to a piece of advertising from a magazine company that his son David, Will Forte, knows to be false. David and his mother Kate, June Squibb, attempt to dissuade Grant from traveling to Nebraska where he believes he will pick up his prize money and be able to afford a truck and a new compressor. He refuses to be put off and David agrees to drive him there so that he will not get into danger on the way there. They stop over in Grant's hometown along the way and resentments come to the surface as his prize winnings become big news in town and everybody from his nephews to his former business partner Ed Pegram, Stacy Keach, want a cut of his supposed fortune. Secrets about Grant's past are revealed to his son as he talks to women and men from his past but when the secret about Grant's winnings is revealed there are consequences.\n\nPayne's major interests all come to light in this film as he examines the loneliness of living in small town America, the pains of weak, middle aged men and the redemptive power of love. This film leans into a Capra-esque positivity more than some of his other films as we finish with an ending that could seem overly sentimental to some. I wasn't sickened by it personally as I have a certain tolerance for these sort of pat statements on the wonder of the world and the beauty of father-son relationships. Payne could more often be accused of having been overly cynical in his films as Election is relentlessly dark in how it's portrays the trajectories of it's lead characters and the fact that this film resembles Good Will Hunting (1997) more than his previous works is in some ways a positive thing. Unlike Sideways it never entirely commits to being a film about the bond between two people as while it is acknowledged that Grant and David have reconciled to a degree we don't know whether they will continue to see one another and do not feel as though they are the perfect relatives.\n\nOne of my major issues with the film was the staid delivery of the dialogue by some of the actors as Forte in particular gives a very stagey, discomforting performance. Even in the opening scene we don't believe him when he expresses disbelief at his father's assertions. He settles into the role as time goes on but compared to Dern and Squibb who feel so comfortable and natural in their roles he seems out of place and trying too hard. The supporting characters also seem like caricatures as the nephews are the sort of hicks that would be found in a Coen brothers film and don't receive the compassion that can be found in the rest of the film. Dern, as stated above, gives a wonderfully textured performance as he employs his craggy face and occasional blank stares to devastating effect with his sadness coming through not through the screaming he is known for but through facial expressions. Squibb is fun as the comedic relief with her unbridled personality and fierce wit coming to the fore.\n\nI would recommend watching this film simply for the performances because whatever the film may lack in character development and Payne's traditional cynicism it is worth it to see one of Dern's greatest performances.",

Another movie about Lincoln?\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Nope. It s Bruce Dern and a million dollar prize. Let s Recap.\n\nSCOTT: Nebraska begins with Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) walking along a highway in Billings, Montana. Woody has just received notification in the mail that he has won a $1 million sweepstakes prize and must travel to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim his winnings. His son, David (Will Forte) finds Woody and tries to convince him that the sweepstakes is a scam. Woody refuses to believe him and will do everything in his power to get to Lincoln, even if it means walking the entire distance of 700 miles.\n\nGREG: But David takes pity on his alcoholic dad and agrees to drive him to Nebraska. They stop along the way in Woody s home town of Hawthorne where they meet a bunch of Woody s old friends and family. Hawthorne hasn t changed much since Woody left it 30 years ago. Everyone treats Woody pretty much as they did when he lived there - dismissively. Things are going pretty well when Woody lets slip that he s won a million dollars. That s when the tides change and people s true feelings come out.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Nebraska is a moving story about a son s journey of discovery with his aging father.  This movie is, simply, a story about a man s love for his father and how that love is tested. It is tested by the father s alcoholism, the father s growing dementia, and some secrets about the father s past. Through it all, we see how love prevails. The son David undergoes a subtle but important transformation in this story. At first, he indulges the father s get-rich fantasy as simply a way of keeping the peace. But as the story unfolds, the son develops a growing awareness of the deeper significance of his father s dream. This revelation about the journey becomes a breakthrough that does more than just bring about the son s own personal transformation. It also leads to a deepened and more meaningful relationship with his father.\n\nGREG: You re right, Scott. David has always seen his father as a flawed man and it seems he never really connected with his dad. He believes that Woody was not a very good father. But by travelling back to Woody s boyhood home, he begins to realize that Woody had a difficult childhood and was, perhaps, more well-adjusted than he at first thought. This is a textured movie. We re witness to sibling rivalry between the two brothers David and Ross (Bob Odenkirk). David s mother Kate (June Squibb) thinks Woody is senile and should be put in a home. She constantly complains that Woody is no help around the house. And the portrait director Alexander Payne paints of small town America is brought home with the silent viewing of football games or sitting on the roadside watching cars go by. It was a very familiar picture for me.\n\nSCOTT: There is so much to like about this film. Many good choices were made by director Alexander Payne. For starters, the decision to film Nebraska in black and white enables the movie to capture the bleakness of the wintry landscape of the upper midwest. It also underscores the simplicity and transparency of the people that David and Woody meet. The cinematography in Nebraska is stark, cold, sweeping, and as big and as desolate as the prairie land itself. Casting Will Forte as David was also a stroke of genius. Forte is highly effective in portraying the sweet innocence of David as well as the sadness and love that David has for his father. It s a love that is simple on the surface but we discover that it is also a love riddled with sad complexities. Bruce Dern is brilliant in his role as Woody, a man who is both endearing and pitiful at the same time. Your description of the film and its characters as  textured  is right on the money, Greg.\n\nGREG: Woody s constant return to walking the highways reminded me of The Odyssey. He kept moving from place to place. Each time he landed there were more monsters to fight. I thought Nebraska was a wonderful story told in the simplest terms about simple people. I enjoyed getting to know Woody step-by-step in his journey. For a good bit of storytelling without being saccharine or patronizing, I give Nebraska 5 out of 5 Reels. This is not a classic hero s journey. David seemed to be more transformed than did Woody. I award the pair of them 4 out of 5 Heroes. Movie:  Hero: \n\nSCOTT: Woody may have been unable to change given his growing dementia, but he did play a significant role in bringing about his son David s transformation. David turns out to be one of the most likeable characters in the movies in the year 2013. The hero journey to Nebraska allows him to grow in ways he never could have anticipated. There is a newfound wisdom and compassion for his father that only this journey could reveal. I agree that his character earns 4 Heroes out of 5. The movie itself is a terrific artistic achievement in the way it was filmed, directed, and executed by everyone involved. The look and feel of Nebraska is unlike anything we ve seen in the movies this year. I was going to give it 4 out of 5 Reels, but Greg, you ve helped convince me that it deserves the entire 5 Reels.

Putting oneself in unfamiliar territory while trying to rebuild an inevitably fractured relationship can rarely result in anything other than frayed nerves, arguments and tears. Yet so many of us have taken the plunge because we thought our road trip would be different.\n\nAnd so it goes with Alexander Payne's bittersweet, comedy-drama, NEBRASKA.\n\nCurmudgeon Woody Grant lives in Billings, Montana along with his long-suffering wife of close to 50 years, Kate. Woody is not altogether there, thanks to a lifetime of heavy drinking and, now, the onset of Alzheimer's. When he receives a letter in the mail that he may have just won a million dollars in one of those publishers' sweepstakes, he starts walking to Lincoln, Nebraska - a distance of 850 miles across three states - to claim his prize. His son, David, intercepts him just outside Billings and brings him back home to try to talk some sense into him but Woody will hear nothing of it. He wants his money. David eventually gives in, thinking that a road trip with his dad might be good for their relationship. You see, Woody was not the best father in the world. Besides being drunk most of the time, Woody is not the most talkative person. His experience fighting in the Korean War 60 years earlier affects him even today.\n\nSo David and Woody jump into David's car and head off to Lincoln. En route, a nighttime fall after a few too many beers puts Woody in the hospital and their plans quickly change. David decides to stop off at Woody's family in fictional Hawthorne, Nebraska for a few days to give Woody a chance to heal. In the meantime, Kate and their older son, Ross, decide to trek to Hawthorne too, to make it a full family reunion.\n\nWhen Woody reveals to brothers' families and his old friends about his million dollar windfall, the vultures start circling. The family says he owes them money for all their support over the years while his ex-business partner demands repayment (and then some!) of the money he lent to Woody many years earlier. Even though David and Ross insist that there is no money, no one believes them. Now David not only has to protect Woody from himself; he has to protect him from his family and friends.\n\nAlexander Payne, who previously wrote and directed SIDEWAYS and THE DESCENDANTS, seems to be attracted to stories that deal with life's unpredictable messiness. In NEBRASKA, he chose to shoot the film in black-and-white, which served to highlight both the starkness of the landscape and the Grant family's lives.\n\nThere is plenty of humour in the film, though it is slow in coming. A scene showing the elderly Grant brothers watching Sunday football on TV seems very reminiscent of Grant Wood's classic painting, American Gothic. (Could there be a connection with the family name being Grant?) The film also features some of the best Upper Midwest American accents since FARGO.\n\nNEBRASKA stars Bruce Dern, who was nominated for an Academy Award (R) for this role, comedian Will Forte, June Squibb, Stacy Keach and Bob Odenkirk, whom audiences may know as the sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman on TV's BREAKING BAD.\n\nThis is a great film but you don't need to go to the cinema to see it. Rent it or download it (legally, of course). You'll enjoy it.",

Bruce Dern garnered all the accolades as the addled, heavy drinking estranged father who thinks he's won a million dollars, but it's June Squibb as his agitated, long-suffering wife who really deserved an Academy Award nomination.  The foul-mouthed senior citizen is such a tired stereotype used for cheap laughs, but the excellent script allows Squibb to develop a full character so that when she interjects the occasional obscenity, it is surprising and truly funny.  The highlight though is when Forte and his brother Bob Oedenkirk decide to retrieve their father's compressor 'borrowed' by a neighboring farmer 40 years ago, and the conversational aftermath in the van had me rolling on the floor.",

            "content": "Nebraska is Alexander Payne's most prickly movie since Election. Thematically, it more closely resembles his later, more humanist films-The Descendants, Sideways. But there's an edge (a dull edge, but an edge nonetheless) that holds the viewer at arm's length-until it relents and you give it a warm embrace. It took me a bit to really get into Nebraska, but when I fell for it, I fell hard. It's an intensely relatable film about family and coming home. Packed with great performances, it's worth mentioning among the year's best films.\n\nThe movie opens with new millionaire Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) trudging along the side of a highway. On his way from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect the prize a letter in the mail told him he won. It's not his first attempted sojourn to Nebraska, and his sons-David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk)-are exasperated. They're nothing compared to his fiesty wife, Kate (June Squibb), who's done, done, DONE with nonsense like this. She and Ross agree it might be time to put Woody in a home, but David thinks his dad just needs a jolt back to reality. Without much going on in his own life, he agrees to drive Woody to Lincoln.\n\nYou might think Nebraska is a road trip movie based on that description and its director's history, but much more happens when Woody and David take a (necessary) detour to the former's hometown of Hawthorne, NE. The film humorously touches on the initial awkwardness one experiences when reconnecting with extended family members for the first time in a while before moving onto issues related to legacy-its most resonant material.\n\nWoody truly walks a fine line between knowingly aloof and frighteningly out of it, and Bruce Dern's performance hits both states of mind with ease. He's hesitant to reveal what he's really thinking about this million dollar prize to his immediate family lest they shut the charade down, but to old friends he hasn't seen in decades-friends who might otherwise pity Woody, rather than envy him-he's got a quick tongue. David watches the entire thing spiral out of control, but he does so while connecting with his dad and watching him feel happier and more loved than he has in years. And of course, when great sums of money (even when they're fictional) suddenly appear, the vultures start to circle. All these factors make Nebraska a deceptively complex story to tell -especially in just 110 minutes-but Payne, working with screenwriter Bob Nelson, turns it into something coherent, something that flows, and something that's warmly funny.\n\nDern-who, again, is simply excellent-has earned top billing for giving the showier performance of the film's two leads, but one could argue Nebraska is really David's story. Forte dials down his comedic, sometimes manic onscreen persona and injects his character with exactly the right amounts of empathy and pride. He's the only one in his family willing to give their tough-to-crack patriarch a chance, and while he recognizes a wild goose chase when he sees one, he's not willing to let outsiders disrupt the delicate harmony he's finally found between stubborn alcoholic father, loud gossipy mother, and disinterested brother. Because the dynamics at play are immensely relatable, it makes Forte's grasp on David quite admirable.\n\nI haven't gotten to Squibb or the film's aesthetic yet. The former provides most of the film's humor. As you might expect, the story is sometimes quite melancholy, but certainly not when she's around. And as far as the film's craft credits go, Phedon Papamichael uses black and white cinematography to, successfully, give the film the feeling of something nostalgic. It's not as rich a black and white as Frances Ha's was earlier this year, but it's lovely nonetheless.\n\nBecause it takes Nebraska (and its characters) a little time to reach the destination where its most satisfying moments take place and its strongest themes take hold, you might not fall in love with film from the outset. Woody is a mostly unpleasant protagonist, and even Kate can be a grating character at times, but the places they go as a family are beautiful and make Nebraska a film I'll treasure.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/nebraska-review/",

Bruce Dern's character, Woody Grant, focuses on the first part of that sentence when he receives a sweepstakes letter in the mail, but doesn't understand (or doesn't want to understand) the second part. He's determined to personally claim \"his million dollars\" by taking the letter from his home in Montana to the offices of the marketing company who sent him the letter in \"Nebraska\" (R, 1:55).\n\nWoody is a gruff old man who doesn't have much going on in his life and is willing to walk the 900 miles to Lincoln, Nebraska if he has to (and tries to do so). His long-suffering sons, David and Ross, played, respectively, by Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk, and Woody's pistol of a wife, Kate (Jane Squibb) are all unable to talk him out of it. David finally agrees to drive his dad to Lincoln. The trip takes them through Woody's hometown where we meet a number of his family members and old friends. Woody begins talking about the fortune he says he has won and word spreads quickly. Everyone enthusiastically congratulates Woody and he becomes the talk of the small town. He enjoys his new found local celebrity, until some of his family and friends start sticking their hands out, deciding that Woody owes them money from back in the day.\n\nIn the end, it doesn't matter whether Woody gets the money or not. This film is much more about the journey than the destination. In content and tone, \"Nebraska\" has elements of 1986's \"Nothing in Common\", 1998's \"Waking Ned Devine\" and 1999's \"The Straight Story\", while, at times, feeling like a Coen Brothers movie. \"Nebraska\" is charming, funny and heart-warming. The film appears in black and white, which serves to enhance its simple, rustic feel. Besides, the movie's characters were colorful enough for me. Most of the actors are good fits for their roles, but Forte is miscast. His acting skills served the broad comedy of Saturday Night Live well, but aren't well-suited to the subtle comedy (and the serious moments) of this film. I found his presence distracting. Odenkirk was very good, and I'll let the Oscar nominations for Dern and Squibb (plus director Alexander Payne, screenwriter Bob Nelson and the film, as a whole) speak for themselves. \"Nebraska\" will leave YOU feeling like a million bucks. \"A-\"",

The fact the this film is in black and white lends a quiet dignity and an additional beauty to it's shots of the stark American countryside. The black and white images also call attention to the many details of the many elderly faces that the film contains. The film is also as funny as it is sad and is deeply concerned with the personal.",

            "content": "It is not all that surprising that it has taken 50 years for Bruce Dern to find a role that fits him like a glove.  He is an actor that Hollywood never really knew what to do with, an intense actor whose characters were always burning with a level of frustration that kept you at arm's length.  He was too unpredictable and strange to be a leading man, so he took supporting roles in films like \"Coming Home\" and \"The Great Gatsby.\"  Yet, he always seemed to stand outside those films.  There was a creepy quality about him that didn't fit any form outside of imploding villains.  He admitted recently in an interview with hitflix.com that after killing John Wayne in 1972's \"The Cowboys\" and then attempting to blow up the Super Bowl in 1977's \"Black Sunday\" that he really had nowhere to go.\n\nNow, at 77, Dern has finally found a role that fits him so well that it got him the Palm D'Or last spring at the Cannes Film Festival.  In Alexander Payne's funny and emotionally tender black and white mid-western comedy \"Nebraska\", he plays Woody Grant, a grouchy old coot with a wisp of unkempt white hair who becomes hell-bent on getting from Montana to Nebraska to claim a million dollars after receiving one of those \"You May Have Already Won\" scam letters designed to sell magazines.  Despite all common sense - and a reasoning explanation from his son David (played by Will Forte in a wonderfully understated performance) - he heads out a fruitless, 850 mile trek to claim his prize money.  David, knowing that it is a trip to nowhere, figures that it might be great to spend a couple of days with dear old dad, and decides to drive him.\n\nWoody's motivation is more or less based on a blind trust.  At 77, he's part of the heartland take-people-at-their-word generation.  He believes what people tell him, and when someone says he has won a million dollars, he thinks it might be rude not to check it out.  At home, he has no earthly reason to hang around the house.  His wife is Kate (June Squibb) is a loud-mouthed battle-axe who never stops talking, and worse, decides to join them.  A great deal of her behavior explains a great deal of Woody's.  With that, a lot of their behavior explains a lot of David's.  It's all generational.\n\nMany of the details of the trip cannot be revealed without giving too much away, except to say that when people hear that a man is about to get a million dollars, old friend and family come out of the wood-work with loving smiles and warm handshakes, which is particularly galling to a man who never  had any use for any of these people, and vice versa.  Thus, \"Nebraska\" becomes a very funny movie about the connective power of people and the awe-inspiring glow of one individual who seems to have more than the lion's share.\n\nThe whole cast is wonderful, but Payne has found a gem in Bruce Dern, who is a wonderful case of the right actor in the right role, and if he had to wait until he was 77 to play it, it was worth the wait.  Woody's mind seems to have been disillusioned by his trustworthy upbringing mixed with a world that refuses to play fair.  He wants to be trustworthy, but he has reached the age at which he has outlived all the tricks and all the games people play and has worn down to a man for whom good fortune is a mere a concept.  Dern has moments in the film in which his face speaks volumes even when he doesn't say a word.  Note, for example, the scene in which the three travelers visit an old cemetery.  June tells David the identity of each headstone.  Behind them stands Woody whose face is haunted by a memory of a younger brother that died in infancy.  Visiting his old boyhood home, there something sad in Woody's eyes when he remembers being punished for walking into his parent's bedroom.  What is special here is that Dern tells us everything we need to know with just a few words, or in most cases, no words at all.  It's that good of a performance.\n\nThe movie was directed by Alexander Payne who specializes in telling laid back stories about people with problems who come to understand the future only by what has come before.  He previously made \"Sideways\", \"About Schmidt\", \"The Descendents\" and the criminally underrated \"Election\", which featured Reese Witherspoon's best performance.  Here he puts together a film in which the characters are built on words.  Listen very carefully to the dialogue and notice how different conversations deepen our knowledge of the characters beyond just their immediate circumstances.  One conversation gives us a little information about Woody and Kate, and then another conversation later by a different person gives us more information.  By the end, we feel that we know their background through the dialogue.  This is a smartly written film that pays off beautifully in a scene that is based on blind deception that the movie has been building all along.  This movie is as much a pleasure to listen to as it is to watch.",

You want the old man, Woody, to be happy, even though you know it will only lead to rejection. It's a fable about patience, and unconditional love. The father-son dynamic is really, really touching. A little movie like this was easily shadowed by the bigger films it was up against in 2013, but it accomplishes what many films in 2013 couldn't.. finding the sublime in the simplistic.

Really, it's a fine movie. But in my opinion, it is not as good as say, another Oscar bait film. It has that reductivist indie feel where less content is incorrectly equated to more depth, like an indie band stringing out only a couple of notes for a song (it might be a bad metaphor because the unique, unexpected score in this film is definitely a highlight).

You could argue that Forte's character changed, but he really didn't.  There was no deep insight into Woody as to why he was the way he was.  He didn't give us any meaningful hints from the past, just broad-stroke thoughts from the townsfolk.  And a bunch of old quiet men sitting around drinking beer and hardly saying anything is as interesting as watching... well, the old quiet men we personally know doing the same thing.  For me, sometimes movies can be too real and characters and situations can be too spot on with people and I know and situations I've experienced.  This takes out the entertainment for me.  I enjoy hints of people I know in characters, but when they are the same people, the movie magic is gone.  That's how it was for me watching this movie.  I \"knew\" the characters, the town and the situations, so it was as boring as watching an less-than-ordinary day from my own life.",

It gives a kind of Karsh look to the weathered faces of the aging, reflective, yet still yearning cast of characters, and suits the rapidly fading memories of a bygone era in recent American history. The acting was pretty good. Bruce Dern gives an effortless performance as a cranky old coot with one attention-seeking foot in the spotlight and the other half-buried in the shadows of utter dementia. The interpersonal conflicts among family and community, past and present are presented in a simple, linear uncomplicated way. The story seems to want to explore the sad truths of a regressive, bankrupt nation and the ridiculous dreams and delusions people cling to. Life is limited and unfinished. Like the heads carved out of Mount Rushmore. Like the forlorn characters wandering on and off the screen. For even after a lifetime of honest hard work aligned with various fixed Christian principles, a restless, quiet desperation lingers. Lies and illusions are necessary to prevent a lonely, inconsolable reality from setting in. And while Alexander Payne manages to keeps things relatively upbeat to prevent dragging us down into a pit of futile despair, he also fails to fully develop and realize the themes he puts forward. Every time Payne rustles up a movie (Sideways, The Descendants) he gets high praise, and this time he almost deserves it. He's a fairly astute cinematician who wants to make meaningful pictures without getting in too deep. Specifically, road movies on half a tank. Thankfully, he doesn't tread into murky Bergman territory, or puff his stuff up with Goddard-like self-importance, but he doesn't do himself much justice by avoiding or brushing off the potential worth and urgency of the matters he introduces. His concepts are cut short. While I'm watching Nebraska, I can't help but wonder how adept filmmakers like Kieslowski or Cassavettes would have treated and serviced the material. What's almost more disappointing than getting old, losing a presence of mind and attempting to reconcile broken memories, is not being able to fully grasp, much less handle and nurture, your own brainchild.",

This odd little movie took me by surprise and by the end of it I had laughed out loud more times than I ever thought I would and in its finale had a lump in my throat big enough to make me choke.  There is simply something very magical about Nebraska.  The movie develops its characters with such grace and uncomfortable strangeness that they become impossible not to watch. \n\nI'll admit I wasn't terribly excited to see Nebraska.  Presented in black and white but set in present day is never really a great selling point for me.  However, I'm glad I stuck with it because after the setup the real grandness of the film begins to come out through its magnificent cast.  Bruce Dern (Big Love), Will Forte (Saturday Night Live), June Squibb (About Schmidt), and Bob Odenkirk (Breaking Bad) all come together with such brilliant hilarity and strange chemistry you just can't look away.  Bruce Dern nails the title roll of Woody Grant, the elderly father of David Grant (Will Forte) who's failing mental health has him thinking there's a million dollars waiting for him in Nebraska.  Will Forte decides to prove a point to his dad by driving him there to show him he has no million dollars waiting for him and that he's being scammed.  What winds up transpiring is a beautiful last journey between father and son as they reconnect with each other and people from their past. \n\n The movie may be filmed in black and white but its subjects are some of the most current I've seen explored in recent films; everything from mental health, to the bad job market, and people looking for handouts.  That doesn't make it much of an escapism movie, but sometimes I enjoy brutally honest films.  Its observations on current topics are spot on and quite bluntly presented.  Not to mention everyone seems to get a moment to actually be real and authentic, not just a character, but also a human with actual emotions reacting as a real person would.  At times they are too real and the sheer shock of their actions is hysterical and unexpected.  Nebraska is a joyous film and although you may not want to be part of this family you do wind up understanding them as if your own.  \n\nNebraska may start slow but it turns a quick corner and finishes strong.  It isn't the year's best movie but it has more meat than it suggests.  Nebraska is a wonderful film filled with many moments to love and cherish.  I was having a hard time naming my top 10 movies of 2013 and thankfully Nebraska was dropped in my lap at the last minute.  I would have been disappointed if I had not had the opportunity to include it.  Go see it and fall in love with it as I did. \n\nFINAL SCORE = 5/5 Bear Paws\n\nWest Fisher\n\nMovieBears.com, Las Vegas\n\nNevada Film Critics Society\n\nThe International Academy of Film & Television\n\nwest@moviebears.com",

            "content": "A sweet, charming, quirkily funny movie.\n\nFrom director Alexander Payne who gave us such gems as Sideways, About Schmidt, The Descendants and Election, this is a road movie with a difference.  Explores many themes: heritage, home, family, memories, fulfillment and greed.\n\nSo many scenes that spark off memories of one's own life, or at least things that one can relate to.\n\nCan be frustrating at times.  There are points where you want to reach and slap a character or two, and periods where it does seem to drift.  These periods are brief, fortunately, and tend to serve a purpose, ultimately.\n\nThe only negative aspect is the cinematography. Payne chose to film this in black & white.  While I generally don't have a problem with B&W films - the lack of colour can help create a mood - here the B&W is unnecessary.  Moreover, it is wasteful.  We have the big skies and beautiful, endless Nebraskan vistas, just bursting to be seen in colour...and we see them in black & white.  Plus the movie is ultimately an upbeat one, so the B&W isn't required.\n\nGood performances all round.  Bruce Dern and June Squibb are great as the mother and father, while Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk give solid performances as the sons.  There's a good balance between the father's ditziness, the mother's nagging, the older brother's focus and the younger brother's rolling eyes-yet-caring-ness.\n\nA must-see.",

The film follows an elderly man (Dern) who believes he has won a million dollars, and travels all over Nebraska with his son, and later his family, trying to collect it. The ending is one of the most empathetic, tearjerker moments in recent film history. Payne builds up this decrepit old man throughout the film, showing that he is lost, self-destructive, and giving, but that no one gives him credit. His son realizes the true history of his family, and how he has treated his father thus far. That is a clearly life changing revelation, and Payne handles this transformation with aplomb. Forte's performance is also very nuanced and sincere in its sentimentality. Odenkirk is great as well, as the concerned older brother who has his own view of the world. June Squibb reminds me of every older woman I have ever met, and yet she's so original in her lewdness and likeability.

Nebraska takes the relatable tone and does a lot with it, adding characters that you will either grow fond of or get completely annoyed by (mostly the latter).\n\nThe main thing that stood out to me when watching the trailer was the film's style. Having the movie be black and white was a great choice for the film's rural setting, and it makes the film much more interesting to watch (on a side note- this film has excellent cinematography).\n\nAfter thinking that he's won a million dollars, an old man travels with his son to Nebraska in order to get it. Along the way they visit the old man's hometown, which is where surprisingly most of the movie takes place. Word gets out that the man's a millionaire and now all of a sudden he's the talk of the town. It's here where the movie either shines or takes a bit of a dip downwards. The acting in this movie was very goo\nd. Everyone did a great job, especially June Squibb who plays my favorite character out of the whole movie. She plays the wife of the old man who is very blunt and that makes her humor all the more effective. Her best scenes involve either her talking about dead people while at their grave side (hilarious scene) and the part where she defends her husband when relatives start demanding they get a part of the million dollars.\nIt's the humor in this movie that either really works or really gets on my last nerve. Like I mentioned previously, the parts were June Squibb were hilarious. However, there were these side humor characters that got on my nerves very quickly. They were annoying cousins that constantly bugged the old man, which might have been the point, but watching them onscreen I just didn't really enjoy after awhile. I also found it odd that there were a lot of people believing the old man, who is an alcoholic, and DIDN'T believe the people who said otherwise. Hearing people act so unrealistically took out a lot of the realism the film was going for.\nOverall Nebraska may not be one of the most stand-out out of the Best Picture Nominees, but it still has some strong elements. Great cinematography, a solid script, and great acting make Nebraska worth your time if anyone's interested.\n\n7.5/10 Great",

His son, played by Will Forte, perhaps seeking reconciliation, decides to drive Dern to Nebraska.  So, things could be rather melancholy but such moods are held at bay by a few acerbic supporting actors (especially foul-mouthed June Squibb and also Stacey Keach).  Dern himself generally keeps his thoughts to himself and is the black hole that swallows the film.

However, I couldn't really pay attention to it for long enough, despite it's striking visuals, great score and eccentric family-centred humour. I decided that I would have to watch it a second time, which was of course the right choice: watching it the second time, I realised that the film was meant to be appreciated for its compositional style. The composition makes the film what cinematographer Phedon Papamichael called \"poetic\".

Casting, acting, script, costume and set design suffice to convey a dreary lower middle class existence. What starts as plot about a son attempting to take care of an unmanageable father quickly changes tone when they end up at Woody's hometown.\n\nBruce Dern is nuanced as the slightly senescent and doddering central figure of this film as Woody. I will not be surprised if he scoops up the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  His character is not likeable, and yet, you do not hate nor blame him because of his sincerity in conviction. Kate is far more disagreeable as his harsh, crude, judgmental wife. June Squibb is unwaveringly on point as this highly realistic personality. Both actors show a commitment to their craft in a subtlety that is typically lost in films nowadays - worthy of their nominations and even potential wins.\n\nAs a whole, the average moviegoer will probably not choose to watch this film.

I have never seen an older women act like that in reality or on film. It was beyond crude. I felt it lent to the contrived screenplay by a novice and unreal situation in the real world. \n\nThe son was way too calm to be from a family so ruckused. In fact the only two people in the family that were legitimately cast were the two songs and they only appeared in the final quarter of the film, which was kind-of bazzaire. I know that a lot of interested parties read these reviews and I have to say I have enjoyed Alexander Payne's direction of movies, particularly Election. This movie just didn't jell for me at all. Alex, you do great works; everyone says they liked this movie, but very few showed up to see it for all the accolades and nominations it received. I was looking forward to a pleasurable time, but as I watched the movie, the more ridiculous I felt it was.  Every scene seemed under cast with very few extras roaming around, too, which added to the artificial filming of a low budget-low impact movie. I wanted to like it, especially since I recently discovered and  loved Payne's older previous works, but may have just wanted to tell the truth instead of insult an academy award winning director.",

Bruce Dern gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a lifelong alcoholic who has escaped inside himself, a man out of touch and seemingly untouched by any events around him. A wonderful film, powerful in its simplicity. Don't miss it.\n\n\"NEBRASKA\" is a father and son road trip, from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska that gets waylaid at a small town in central Nebraska, where the father grew up and has scores to settle.

He was one of the Oscar noms in a lead role. Very tough year for that category and maybe he belonged, maybe he didn't. I haven't seen much of his work to know how well he acted. \n\nThe rest of it is so-so. Forte and Odenkirk work as the brothers. The grandma is a little over the top. The cousins are a bit of a caricature of ignorant hicks. \n\nBut a few scenes were able to carry the movie. You basically have a man who is made out to be a selfish alcoholic who never cared for his family. As the plot progresses, Forte's character begins to learn about his dad. The trip the cemetery is pretty brutal maybe because of or in spite of the over-the-top grandma. And the trip to the farm is also fairly uncomfortable. And it's only that way because both scenes effectively portray something very negative.\n\nSo decent plot but some of the characters are just a little unreal. And maybe some of the situations, too.

There are many great performances here.  Will Forte, who until now I've only seen on Saturday Night Live, does an outstanding job as David, a son trying to understand his delusional father.  Bob Odenkirk, the outstandingly hilarious lawyer Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad, plays David's big brother Ross, who is finding some measure of success in the world while still holding onto some bitterness about his dad's drinking days, which haven't quite gone away.  June Squibb is nothing short of brilliant as their sharp, hilarious, and often raunchy mother who always has a putdown ready for her husband who's ways have been annoying her all their marriage, or perhaps someone dead who she used to know.  The movie, however, belongs to Bruce Dern.  Dern magnificently plays Woody Grant, who believes he's won $1 million dollars in one of those phony-boloney magazine subscription sweepstakes.  \n\nWhen David agrees to take him to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim his \"winnings\" he does so to have some time with him.  As they make the long trek from Billings, Montana they make frequent stops until they reach Woody's hometown.  There David begins to learn about why his father is the way he is.  It's not always pretty and some things are left to our imagination, but overall this is a very sweet film about a sympathetic character.

This really is the best road movie ever based around a completely pointless journey, but of course the \"winning\" ticket plot device isn't the main or only concept at play here. Bruce Dern really is untouchable in this role, as he plays Woody without a shred of disbelief in anything the does or says, or indeed in a lot of cases what he doesn't say or do, he's just so damn perfect that this is his movie through and through. That's not to say the rest of the cast aren't very good too, June Squibb as Woody's very to the point wife gets a good share of the some of the best laughs, while Will Forte keeps everything together. Overall a somewhat highly recommended, non Hollywood glossed-over look at small town average life, that tells its simple yet thought-packed story very effectively at its own pace, and in its own particular way.",

            "content": "Many films substitute subtlety with flash, choosing to rely on explanation rather than undertones and subtext. There are many reasons for this, all of which are perfectly sensible: easier writing, undemanding acting, and more importantly, it results in a more marketable film. Obviously, this doesn't encompass all films right now, because if so, Alexander Payne'sNebraska wouldn't sell a ticket. The director's slight touch and the magnificent writing of Bob Nelson pair to create a soft-spoken, alluring tale of a son meeting his father for the first time on his own turf.\n\nThe master of subtlety on screen is Woody (Bruce Dern), an aging retiree living in Montana who is confused and, at times, alienating to those around him. Thinking he's won a sweepstakes, Woody travels to Nebraska, his son David (Will Forte) helping by chauffeuring his ailing father to Lincoln to collect his \"prize\" (the sweepstakes letter is obviously simple marketing). Along the way, the two men stop in Hawthorne, a farming village with an \"everyone-knows-everyone\" type of feel, and an impromptu family reunion follows. Being Woody's hometown, David knows that there are stories, and even secrets, about his father that might be worth the effort to investigate.\n\nNebraska is not about these secrets, however, and is probably a bit disappointing for those expecting a son uncovering his father's previously unexplained past. We learn very relevant and at times impactful details about Woody's life (a particularly forceful example being Woody's brief explanation of sharing a room with his infant brother who died of scarlet fever). We get to see his old house (built by David's grandfather), Woody's first place of employment (Woody's father owned a mechanic shop), and we even meet an old flame. Nevertheless, these are merely morsels of information to push David to dig for more information. This backstory is necessary, and at times it dominates the screen and the dialogue, certainly with the help of Woody's crass wife (June Squibb).\n\nPayne delivers his entr\u00e9e late into the film; only after a lengthy run through town (literally and figuratively), meeting all kinds of Woody's past acquaintances, do we start to learn why David took to the road with his father. Dern's fine touch on his role is especially felt near the end too, when his motivations for claiming his prize are really exposed. Of course, more blatant hints are pushed towards us throughout the film, with Woody's former friends asking at every opportunity \"What are you going to do with a million dollars?\" In one sense, Woody answers them straight every time. On the other hand, it's obvious that he doesn't need a million dollars, but just a fraction of it.  \n\nLike driving across the American west, it took a long time to get there. Sure, the cards may have been stacked against the producers; Nebraska was about an aging man and his unbearable wife, and the man travels with his lackluster son to Nebraska of all places. We have to assume the treatment was probably devoid of the word \"excitement.\" But there were still many opportunities to progress David's hunt for his father's past with a bit more pace, whether it be more dialogue between the two or perhaps more clues like his investigation of the Hawthorne newspaper's historical archives.\n\nAnd yet, Nebraska isn't a treasure hunt, and it doesn't aspire to be. Payne paints a portrait (on black and white, mind you) of a strained relationship between a man and his surroundings, and these connections are tested, prodded, and inspected. The subtlety in the writing and the acting mirrors the landscape the two men drove on, lacking any frills or luster. Forte performs commendably in one of his first serious roles, and was an excellent compliment to a brilliant Dern.\n\nReal, delicate, and understated, Payne brings us Nebraska as a place where one man's wishes come true...even if those wishes are as simple as driving a new truck.\n\nRead more reviews at RJGFilmAnalysis.com",

            "content": "After the nearly two-hour experience of watching Nebraska, I came away with some appreciation for the story director Alexander Payne and writer Bob Nelson were trying to tell. I just honestly didn't find much to enjoy in it. A shame really as I was looking forward to this film based on Alexander Payne's great work with Sideways and The Descendants.\n\nNebraska is a story about past regrets, and a son's desperate need to make a genuine connection to his father. Somewhat subtle in its execution but obvious at the same time, Nebraska asks the viewer to take a road trip with two men, Woody (Bruce Dern), his son David (Will Forte) as they travel to collect a bogus non-existent sweepstake check for one million dollars. This journey leads them to Woody's home town of Hawthorne, Nebraska, where his son starts to learn more about his fathers past. Unfortunately this also means we get to meet the entire family, and for the most part, they were a pretty unlikable bunch of people.\n\nNebraska takes its sweet time telling this story, and only starts to get to the meat of Woody's (Bruce Dern) past after the half way point. Beyond that, revelations about Woody are few and far between , and most of the 'in-between' moments throughout the film are filled with awkward dull conversations between family members that can barely string three words into a sentence. There are some genuinely funny moments here and there, mostly provided through some great dialog delivered with zeal by June Squibb, but on the whole I found this film pretty dull.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you like your comedy/drama on the slower more subtle side, I think you may enjoy this a lot more than I did. It also serves as a great showcase for two outstanding performances from Bruce Dern and June Squibb so it certainly deserves a viewing based on that alone. This isn't a bad film really, it just wasn't my cup of tea.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThe film is shot in black and white, and looks great. A HD viewing at home on your TV will service the film well enough.\n\nBest Element:\n\nI really liked June Squibb in Nebraska, and I wish she had gotten more screen time. She was for me the most entertaining element in this otherwise dull film.\n\n\n-> http://talkiegazette.com/nebraska-2013/\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Beautifully shot in widescreen b&w, this is an emotional turn on impending decline and death.\n\nDern is building on the memorable character he created in the TV show Big Love. He is just as unlikable and cantankerous. For large parts Payne shows Woody's face staring at the beautiful Midwest landscapes. A face blank, bereft of emotion; seemingly desperate to die. It's a fantastic performance.\n\nWhat stops it being a great film is that it never really gets the balance right between affection and caricature.\n\nWoody's quest for the $1m initially seems utterly absurd. Then, we realise, it is giving him a reason to live; and his son an excuse to spend time with him. Nebraska may be a conventional story about a distant child rediscovering his love for his grumpy old father but I thought it mostly succeeded.",

Sharp, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography does a masterful job of driving home the moral gray areas of its cast, while also reinforcing the bleak, desolate landscapes of the American plains in winter. Bruce Dern is hauntingly effective as the desperate lead character, teetering on the verge of dementia while his family deals in their own ways, but it's Jane Squibb who steals the scenery. Her turn as the family's stodgy, no-nonsense, firecracker of a matron is a real standout, deliciously funny in a picture that sorely needs that kind of relief. The remainder of the cast doesn't fare so well, with several reciting their lines so flatly that they might be reading straight from cue cards. It's a depressing bit of truth, one that seems to enjoy lingering in the moment, but generally moves along smoothly enough. An uneven patch near the end of the second act is the only bit that seems to drag. Poignant and melancholy, but also rich and familiar - I'd have liked a bit more activity, but that's simply not its style.",

            "content": "It is not all that surprising that it has taken 50 years for Bruce Dern to find a role that fits him like a glove.  He is an actor that Hollywood never really knew what to do with, an intense actor whose characters were always burning with a level of frustration that kept you at arm's length.  He was too unpredictable and strange to be a leading man, so he took supporting roles in films like \"Coming Home\" and \"The Great Gatsby.\"  Yet, he always seemed to stand outside those films.  There was a creepy quality about him that didn't fit any form outside of imploding villains.  He admitted recently in an interview with hitflix.com that after killing John Wayne in 1972's \"The Cowboys\" and then attempting to blow up the Super Bowl in 1977's \"Black Sunday\" that he really had nowhere to go.\n\nNow, at 77, Dern has finally found a role that fits him so well that it got him the Palm D'Or last spring at the Cannes Film Festival.  In Alexander Payne's funny and emotionally tender black and white mid-western comedy \"Nebraska\", he plays Woody Grant, a grouchy old coot with a wisp of unkempt white hair who becomes hell-bent on getting from Montana to Nebraska to claim a million dollars after receiving one of those \"You May Have Already Won\" scam letters designed to sell magazines.  Despite all common sense - and a reasoning explanation from his son David (played by Will Forte in a wonderfully understated performance) - he heads out a fruitless, 850 mile trek to claim his prize money.  David, knowing that it is a trip to nowhere, figures that it might be great to spend a couple of days with dear old dad, and decides to drive him.\n\nWoody's motivation is more or less based on a blind trust.  At 77, he's part of the heartland take-people-at-their-word generation.  He believes what people tell him, and when someone says he has won a million dollars, he thinks it might be rude not to check it out.  At home, he has no earthly reason to hang around the house.  His wife is Kate (June Squibb) is a loud-mouthed battle-axe who never stops talking, and worse, decides to join them.  A great deal of her behavior explains a great deal of Woody's.  With that, a lot of their behavior explains a lot of David's.  It's all generational.\n\nMany of the details of the trip cannot be revealed without giving too much away, except to say that when people hear that a man is about to get a million dollars, old friend and family come out of the wood-work with loving smiles and warm handshakes, which is particularly galling to a man who never  had any use for any of these people, and vice versa.  Thus, \"Nebraska\" becomes a very funny movie about the connective power of people and the awe-inspiring glow of one individual who seems to have more than the lion's share.\n\nThe whole cast is wonderful, but Payne has found a gem in Bruce Dern, who is a wonderful case of the right actor in the right role, and if he had to wait until he was 77 to play it, it was worth the wait.  Woody's mind seems to have been disillusioned by his trustworthy upbringing mixed with a world that refuses to play fair.  He wants to be trustworthy, but he has reached the age at which he has outlived all the tricks and all the games people play and has worn down to a man for whom good fortune is a mere a concept.  Dern has moments in the film in which his face speaks volumes even when he doesn't say a word.  Note, for example, the scene in which the three travelers visit an old cemetery.  June tells David the identity of each headstone.  Behind them stands Woody whose face is haunted by a memory of a younger brother that died in infancy.  Visiting his old boyhood home, there something sad in Woody's eyes when he remembers being punished for walking into his parent's bedroom.  What is special here is that Dern tells us everything we need to know with just a few words, or in most cases, no words at all.  It's that good of a performance.\n\nThe movie was directed by Alexander Payne who specializes in telling laid back stories about people with problems who come to understand the future only by what has come before.  He previously made \"Sideways\", \"About Schmidt\", \"The Descendents\" and the criminally underrated \"Election\", which featured Reese Witherspoon's best performance.  Here he puts together a film in which the characters are built on words.  Listen very carefully to the dialogue and notice how different conversations deepen our knowledge of the characters beyond just their immediate circumstances.  One conversation gives us a little information about Woody and Kate, and then another conversation later by a different person gives us more information.  By the end, we feel that we know their background through the dialogue.  This is a smartly written film that pays off beautifully in a scene that is based on blind deception that the movie has been building all along.  This movie is as much a pleasure to listen to as it is to watch.",

It shows a world seldom seen on film, but it's absolutely brilliant. When elderly alcoholic Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) receives a letter claiming he's won a $1 million sweepstakes prize, (it's clearly a scam), and Woody is trying to get from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim the prize, but his son David (Will Forte) can't talk him out of it, but with Woody's wife Kate (June Squibb) about to lose patience, David agrees to drive Woody to Lincoln, and they stop off on the way in Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska. They stop with Woody's brother Ray (Rance Howard) and his family. But after Woody's old business partner Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) hears of Woody's apparent windfall, he and everyone wants a part of it. This is moving, poignant and funny look at middle America, and how there's some places still lost in time, and how America is moving backwards with the Recession. Dern is brilliant, and he deserves an Oscar for this, and it's a reminder of what a good actor he still is. Payne has a knack for quirky character pieces, and this is his best.",

It does have its charms here and there (particularly Bruce Dern's performance), but the film quickly outstays its welcome and becomes an extremely monotonous watch. Bob Nelson's script is painfully predictable at times and some of the banter that goes on between the characters just feels really un-organic when spoken by allot of the characters. The pace and the repetitive score of the movie also took it's toll on me and ultimately left me feeling apathetic towards the characters and their journeys. The film would have flowed much better if it had 20-30 minutes trimmed down and if Dern's character (despite the fine performance) wasn't written so one dimensionally that he was easy to lose interest in. Despite the fact that there were a few moments I actually really liked in the film, I was relieved by the time that the credits began to role.",

            "content": "Review taken from my blog: http://itsasmallfilmworldafterall.wordpress.com/2014/02/07/nebraska-2013-review/\n\nPlot: An aging, booze-addled father makes the trip from Montana to Nebraska with his estranged son in order to claim a million-dollar Mega Sweepstakes Marketing prize.\n\nI just simply love this kind of tale, the father-son reunion, set to the brilliance of the open road. When it's done right, road trip movies seem to be some of the finest movies available, with their humble roots and down home American slice-of-life nature. Films like \"Rain Man\", \"Easy Rider\", \"Sideways\". Thelma And Louise\", \"Little Miss Sunshine\", \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\", Transamerica\". \"Planes Trains and Automobiles\", and most especially \"Paris, Texas\" are some of the finest movies out there. And why? Because of the adventure of the story, and the unique characters that we encounter while taking the trip with the main heroes, or villains, of the story. Now, father-son reunion tales are nothing new and can be cliched beyond all belief, but when done right they turn into pure gold. I was a tad bit hesitant of this movie, seeing as the writer of the film hasn't really written anything before, but when I saw all the glowing reviews from the critics and audience I knew I just had to see it.\n\nThe film starts pretty abruptly with one of Woody Grant's (Bruce Dern) famed drunken shenanigans: he learns that he has a million dollar winning sweepstakes ticket, or so he thinks, so what does he do? He takes off on his own, down the lonely, but open road to travel by foot from Billings, Montana all the way to Lincoln, Nebraska because he thinks that he is a big, million dollar winner. Luckily for everyone around him, he is stopped by a police officer and brought home by his loving, but estranged son David (Will Forte). Of course, when David brings Woody back home he is greeted by his mother Kate (June Squibb), and is informed that his father has this ridiculous idea in his head that his is a prizewinner and that he must travel to Lincoln to collect his winnings. That's were all the fun begins.\n\nWoody's persistence and bullheaded, stubborn ways remind me somewhat of my own father. Granted, my dad is 35 years younger than Bruce Dern but the character resonates well in a lot of ways.\n\nThis, as I've previously stated, is screenwriter Bob Nelson's first cinematic project, and right off the bat the movie starts off brilliantly. He develops his characters and the settings they're placed in with precision and an easy pace. The development of each individual character, especially Woody and David, had an array of depth and unique bite that is not common in recent films of this nature. The film conjured up realistic human emotions and a feeling of longing, as displayed wonderfully by Woody, and while dramatic, the film had a wonderful adventurous side and a very keen, witty sense of humor. The movie was actually funny, laugh-out loud funny, thanks to the random one liners that June Squibb's character Kate kept throwing left and right. It has always been my dream to live in a small town like this, or to travel, and that's why I look to these sort of films, when they don't disappoint, to be transported into this quaint world. And Nelson did that fantastically, he captured a movie with depth, heart, and adventure, and transported us into the quaint but adventurous tale of Woody and his family's wacky shenanigans.\n\nBruce Dern and Will Forte both give career defining, warm performances as father and son Woody and David. Dern went the extra mile while playing Woody, instead of hamming it up and playing him as a loud-mouthed drunk, he played the character thoughtfully low-key and conservatively. He has given many brilliant performances in his time, especially in \"Coming Home\", where he was also Oscar nominated, but I think this is the finest acting role and most honest performance he has ever given. Although I think Matthew McConaughey is going to win for Best Actor, I believe that Bruce Dern has a very good chance at finally taking home the well-deserved award. Will Forte too gave such a magnificent performance, perfectly portraying the emotions of an estranged son with grace and deadpan humor. June Squibb, who was just outstanding and absolutely hilarious in her role as Kate Grant, also has a fantastic chance of winning for Best Supporting Actress. The film also features some fine supporting work from actor Stacy Keach, portraying Woody's former friend-turned enemy Ed Pegram, and Bob Odenkirk portraying Woody's older son Ross.\n\nAlexander Payne has been impressing me with his directorial work for quite some time now, with such great films as \"The Descendants\" and\"Sideways\", Sideways being my favorite of his work. \"Nebraska\" has officially taken that spot away from \"Sideways\", I think this is his best directorial effort yet. Phedon Papamichael's beautiful, picturesque black and white digital cinematography is definitely worthy of the Best Achievement in Cinematography Oscar. Modern movies, especially movies of this nature, just look so gorgeous shot in black-and-white, and Phedon uses it to his advantage. Without a doubt the finest shot cinematography of the year, beating out my favorite nominee contender \"Gravity\" by a small margin. The musical score was also quite noteworthy, composed by Mark Orton. It was a beautifully composed mix of acoustic guitar melodies, melancholy bluegrass, and lushly played horn and string sections that were well-placed and wonderfully complimented each scene. The film also featured some pieces that weren't originally composed, including Foghat's Fool For the City, and Elvis Presley's In The Ghetto, sang in a hilarious scene by Stacy Keach.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Nebraska\" is both in equal parts a father-and-son drama and a road movie done perfectly by writer Bob Nelson, whose screenplay is a mixture of honest, touching moments and on-point witty humor. The characters have a ton of depth to them, and are played out perfectly by the entire cast - especially by Bruce Dern and Will Forte. \"Nebraska\" is an adventurous, well-shot slice of Americana and just an honestly great movie.\n\nMy Rating: 10/10, a must see!\n\nThanks for Reading!",

His son ends up taking him to Lincoln to claim his prize but there are many obstacles on the way. This is a well written drama with a great cast, who all put in great performances. It does take some time to get going and it's a bit slow in some parts, but the individual characters really do bring different flavours to the piece. Bruce Dern played his role extremely well, but it was his wife that stole the show for me. The black and white tone to the whole film, really does work and I liked the ending which brought the movie together nicely. You do have to be in the right mood for the film because it's not really that exciting but it's a well made film. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nBruce Dern, who has starred in many movies through the years, has finally been noticed as a leading actor after playing loads of cameos. At 77, he was nominated for an academy award for this movie which shows that it never too late, although he did loose out to Matthew McConaughey. Anyway, the relationship that builds between his character and his son was touching and realistic in many ways. Will Forte, who played the lead in that ridiculous movie McGruber, was much better in this movie even though he is known for his comedic roles. \n\nBudget: $12million\nWorldwide Gross: $18million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there road movies about a father and son travelling across America to claim a $1million dollar prize. 5/10",

I say unfortunately because this is an extremely pleasant experience. \n    I am guessing most people overlook this one simply because it's shot in black and white, but it starts making sense once you let the movie roll. The scenery has an unique charm in monochrome. If the action took place in an exotic location colors would have been obligatory. But the \"world\" of Nebraska is simple, plain and filled with grey characters.\n   As you can see by the various nominations and awards the center point is the performance of Bruce Dern as a semi-conscious, alcoholic old man. He starts of as an enigma to us. He is just a senile man that finds purpose in a false winning ticket. As the movie progresses you get introduced to the secrets and scares lying under this stale, simple individual. There is also a structure that the movie manages to bring across rather nice. In every aged couple the wife tries to grasp on to every ounce of false enthusiasm while the husband is left in chair waiting to die. There is one scene where this sad truth hits you in a strangely humorous manner.\n     Nebraska is filled with moments that made me giggle. It's not really that funny, but the performances are just so good. Former SNL member Will Forte stars as the son and he probably the goofiest voice and attitude imaginable. In the end this should be appreciated more than it is. It's an interesting study of the life of the elderly.",

It felt like a statement against the current crop of beautifully coloured movies (partly emerging due to the ever-increasing entertainment screen quality) that lack character substantiation or coherent plots in favour of blow-your-mind visuals. Nebraska is a beautiful film, just perhaps not in the way that Gravity is seen as beautiful. \nThe plot follows a father and son's journey to collect his $1 million dollar winnings. What follows addresses ideas of the meaning of material wealth; the nature of friendship; the idea of family and especially the bond between a son and his father. \nThe acting is outstanding from beginning to end. The lead roles of the Grant family are well met by Will Forte as the son; Bruce Dern as the elderly father. June Squibb as the elderly mother is another beacon of light with her blunt discourse and enigmatic persona. Made-famous by his involvement in Breaking Bad, Bob Odenkirk carries another solid performance as the second son involved in the story.\nI won't spoil the ending but the ending is not what matters at all. Enjoy director Alexander Payne's latest testament in his captivating filmography. You won't miss the colour.",

A sad comedy, 'Nebraska' is set in the present-day midwest, with Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) bent on making his way to Lincoln, Nebraska after he receives a piece of junk mail that claims he won a million dollars, and after a few attempts at trying to walk there from his home in Billings, Montana, Woody's son David (Will Forte) offers to drive him there himself just to prove a point to his father. As you can imagine, this multiple day-long trip becomes more of a father-son bonding session, where the two clash over things like trying to find Woody's missing false teeth to whether or not Woody is an alcoholic. Things continue to get interesting as Woody and David meet up with their feisty wife/mom Kate (June Squibb) and son/brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk), a local newscaster, as they all converge in an impromptu family reunion in a sleepy Nebraska town. And then, Woody can't help but try to impress his old friends, so he runs his mouth about his \"winnings.\" The film is somewhat slow-paced, but this actually works to its advantage, as it gives time for Woody's and David's relationship to be on display. Other admirable elements of 'Nebraska' include its folksy soundtrack and acting, and the black-and-white color scheme also sets its apart from other films of a similar nature - it really gives it more character. To conclude the dysfunctional-ness of the film, 'Nebraska' ends on a very touching note. It may not be flashy, ninny or new, but 'Nebraska' is a heartwarming story that's worth experiencing.",

Stranger Than Paradise from Jim Jarmusch comes to my memory... the slow pace, the black and white cinematography and reminiscent camera work, the mix of comedy with drama in a plot where nothing spectacularly memorable happens no matter the absurdness of the situations the protagonists live through are some of the elements shared by both works, but they are still very different in premiss, substance and qualities. If not for occasional superfluous directing decisions to add comical moments which distracted more than anything else and a few lackluster acting performances, I'd rate Nebraska higher but I can not judge Jarmusch movie the same way, for example.

I don't know how he thought of it, but that simple choice lends so much weight and sobriety to an already striking story. With the distraction of colour removed, the lives of the characters come into sharper focus, and the landscape of Nebraska becomes a bleak canvas for another trademark Payne road trip - bittersweet, funny and cathartic.\n\nThis story about a son who, to the displeasure of his no-nonsense mother, goes to great lengths to indulge his elderly father's delusion that he has won a million-dollar prize is beautifully acted, particularly by Bruce Dern and June Squibb, who play the elderly couple. I suspect that of all the performances that were nominated for the 2014 Academy Awards, these are two that might gain a lot more respect over time.  The internet might have lost its mind over Leonardo DiCaprio missing out on the Best Actor Oscar, but I think performances like Dern's (who was Leo's fellow nominee), are much subtler and harder to carry off. Similarly, those who feel Jennifer Lawrence should have walked away with the Supporting Actress statuette should take a look at June Squibb here - at the tender age of 84, she more than matches JLaw in the scene-stealing department.\n\nThis is another lovely addition to Alexander Payne's rosy filmography. I've seen four of his films now, and though they have mostly been very similar in theme, each one of them still feels fresh and sincere. His IMDb page doesn't list any upcoming projects, and that makes me gloomy.",

The performances are top notch. Bruce Dern is great, so is Will Forte as the son. The chemistry between Will Forte and Bruce Dern is really good. You really believe they are father and son, and you believe the son cares about the father. Bob Odenkirk is known for his Breaking Bad role as Saul, the lawyer. I watched Breaking Bad, and I have to say that he is great in this movie. You don't see Saul you see the character that Bob Odenkirk portrays, Ross, which is Will Forte's, David, brother. But the best part of the movie is June Squibb as Kate, Woody's, played by Bruce Dern ,wife. She is hilarious in the role. She is the funniest part of the movie, she made me laugh with most of the things she said. This is the first movie by Alexander Payne and now i think he is one of the best directors, just from this movie alone. This isn't just a comedy, it is also a drama. It has a lot of heart to it. I really liked how it can make me laugh and feel emotional in different scenes. It really handles the laughs and the dramatic moments really well. The movie is slow and some people might not like it. I didn't really mind it. My complains, sometimes the movie could get boring. Not really boring, but it slows down with it's already slow pace. Other than that i don't really see any problems with the movie; just a couple of nit picks here and there. I cannot wait until I buy it on Blu-Ray so i can watch it again.

That sounds tacky, I know, but that's the subtext of the thing. Driving across the state to retrieve an imaginary million dollars is the main story. It's a very sweet and funny film that examines relationships between people without getting overly schmaltzy, and it has a wit and an underlying cynical edge that Alexander Payne carries from movie to movie. He's one of my favorite current directors and I always look forward to his output. This is a wonderful film, beautifully-shot and well put together.",

            "content": "Nebraska is a slow burn, wryly-funny character study of understated proportions, highlighting Midwestern culture rarely given its big screen due. So, in essence, it's an Alexander Payne movie.\n\nWoody Grant (Bruce Dern) is an elderly man convinced he has won a million dollars and all he needs to do is travel to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim his loot. It's one of those mass mailings really meant to get people to buy magazine subscriptions, but Woody will not be stopped, sneaking out to walk all the way to Nebraska from his home in Billings, Montana. David (Will Forte) is in a rut himself. He's recently been dumped, his job is going nowhere, and his father refuses to accept his million dollars isn't real. There's a question of how lucid Woody is, and so to placate his old man, David decides to drive his father to pick up his winnings, to humor him before his mind may be gone for good.\n\nNebraska film stillDespite the overtly sitcom machinations of the inciting incident, which even the characters dismiss, the film is really a drama about the relationship between a father and son and the culmination of our life choices. Woody and David are not close by any conventional means but over the course of their road trip, David begins to see his father in a different light; the old wounds are not forgotten, but David is learning about who his father is through others. He's been so mad at his father for so long that it was the only identity he had for the man. Now in his deteriorating mental state and physical fragility, his father has a sense of vulnerability that brings about decidedly mixed emotions. In his fragile state, is he the same man or at least the same man David remembers? Then there are all the family revelations springing out from the situation. With a genuine millionaire in their midst, the family is coming out of the woodwork clamoring for their own pieces for all the unpaid assistance they've given Woody over the years. Initially, it makes Woody look like he's been stuck trying to find his footing his whole life, as we learn about the lingering post-traumatic stress effects from his war service. Was he lazy, undiagnosed PTSD, or, as another character surmises, too ashamed to say no when others asked for help, and so he was taken advantage of in the guise of assistance from unscrupulous friends and family. The question remains who is Woody?\n\nThis is one of those observational slice-of-life films, and your enjoyment of it will depend on your threshold for the taciturn types. These are the strong silent types who keep most of their feelings to themselves. There's a very funny sequence where Woody and his aged brothers have gathered around a TV, and to listen to the dry mostly car-related conversation bounce back and forth like a dead, floating wiffle ball, is a great comic moment but also a nice insight into an older generation and their communication. Given the perspective of the film, it's hard to deduce whether the plainspoken people are being satirized or whether it's a loving send-up of a specific culture. With Payne's involvement, I lean more on the affectionate tweaking rather than a mean-spirited ridiculing of small town folk and their small town ways. There are funny situations, like David and Ross teaming up for some misplaced justice, and there are characters more broadly drawn for laughs, particularly Woody's wife (June Squibb), but the overall interaction of the characters, their speaking vernacular, and how they viewed themselves, that is what made me laugh the most and appreciate the script. You feel like you're dropping in on these people's lives; every character feels like they could be a real person, not a stereotype. And boy does money really bring out the worst in people.\n\nWith Woody and his son visiting his old haunts, the movie inevitably becomes a reflection of a man taking stock of his life, regarding the choices he made and did not make. The pit stop in town opens up the character and David learns far more about his father, with old girlfriends, old business partners, and old rivals. What I appreciated further is that Nebraska doesn't try and soften Woody; he's not going to be some old curmudgeon who over the course of 90 minutes has his icy heart thaw and comes to realize the errors of his ways. Nope. Our views on the old man may soften when we get a fuller picture of who he is ad the life he's lead, but the man himself is the same. He's readily belittled, insulted, looked down upon, even by his own family members, especially his sassy wife. It's easy for him to retreat into alcohol and wonder what if. As the family picture broadens and becomes more clear, the film approaches simply yet touching revelations about the family and the nature of legacy. There's a father/son examination, but there's also the discussion of what to do when your parents become too ill to take care of themselves. It's not exactly The Savages, but there's a circling sense of burdensome decision-making that provides an extra level of pathos to the sitcom setup. By the end, Nebraska squeezes out some earned sentiment without losing its edge or sense of identity. There's a lot more going on then just some send-up of rubes.\n\n20131110-DERN-slide-KFYJ-articleLargePeople have been raving about Dern (TV's Big Love, Django Unchained) ever since the film's Cannes premier, where the man earned top acting honors. The man deserves every positive words penned. He's simply fantastic. The character vacillates between outward hostility, spacing out, and general Midwestern emotional reserve, and Dern is able to sell you on every emotional beat without breaking character. He's unrepentant and demands to be taken for who he is, and his matter-of-fact bluntness has a certain charm to it, like when he admits to David that he never had any plans for kids. He just liked to \"screw\" and their mother was a Catholic (\"You do the math\"). I even appreciate that Woody would use the term \"screw,\" which seems more appropriate. As a two-man show, it's a shame that Forte (TV's 30 Rock, The LEGO Movie) doesn't exhibit the dramatic chops to keep up with his onscreen pop. It's nice to see him attempt something so different but his limitations are too evident; it's just another gear that's not present. At no point would I call Forte's performance bad but he's just unable to keep up. Squibb (About Schmidt, Meet Joe Black) is a hoot though the character seems to be permanently stuck in \"wacky\" mode. She'll crack you up with her unrestrained commentary, but you may wonder if there's any more to this character than saying outrageous, curt comments.\n\nThis was the last Best Picture nominee I'd failed to catch up with, and while it's entertaining, funny, and unexpectedly touching thanks to terrific acting and a sharp script, but it also might be the weakest Alexander Payne film yet. This is the first film that the Oscar-winning director hasn't written himself. Bob Nelson's screenplay may never have even been glanced over by Payne had it not been for the state of its title (Payne's films general take place in Omaha). It's got Payne's stamp, as would any film he directs, but it also feels like it's missing something ephemeral, not to get too pretentious. This is a quality study of a cracked group of characters that, upon further review, aren't as cracked as we may think. They're just flawed people trying to get along as best they can. Even amidst the snide and antagonistic conversations, there's gentleness here about the value of family that resonates above the din of the shouting. By film's end, what started as a cockeyed sitcom transforms into a film that has more meaning and emotion, never betraying its guarded sense of self. When I say the weakest Payne film, this is not an insult but merely an observation. Even the weakest Alexander Payne film is going to be so much better than just about everything out there.\n\nNate's Grade: A-",

The pace of the film can slow down at times, and some of the peripheral actors do not rise to the caliber of Dern (such as the Pegy Nany former girlfriend who I thought was rather flat).  But I seem to remember that Payne likes to use actual real people and not actors, with secondary characters, in his films, and I kind of like that too.  Bruce Dern was magnificent.  If you didn't see Nebraska, works great on DVD, on a lazy evening, with a nice glass of pinot noir (a nod to Sideways).",

This belief he holds throughout the film is what holds together its sentimental tone. However, just as Nebraska is shot in black and white, it also carries a comedic undertone to it that accompanies its more gloomier mood, which can arguably be credited to June Squibb`s performance as Dern`s judgemental yet hilarious wife. A performance that surprised me was Will Forte and his ability to draw out sympathy for Dern`s character. Not to be overshadowed by the acting department, Alexander Payne does a magnificent job directing Nebraska. He has a keen eye for creating the mood of the scene with the use of the music. However, when watching Nebraska, one can`t help to notice the set design. It does its job in drawing the audience into the film`s time and place, which really helps us connect with the characters, not that we weren`t already capable of that thanks to Bruce Dern`s Oscar worthy performance. I felt that the same music track was playing in the movie too many times, that it began to make my ears numb to it. Apart from being a bit too predictable and having a particularly slow middle, this movie does succeed in what it's trying to accomplish. Overall, Nebraska was a movie that was never too dramatic and never too comedic, it was just right.",

            "content": "Ok, its been a while since my last review, but slowly I'm trying to catch up. But one film I did see before I had to take a break was this film, Nebraska. Alexander Payne has done some wonderful films within the last few decades. Election, Sideways, and the Descendants have all been proof of his talent for mixing comedy and drama. And Nebraska is just further proof of how much talent is on display. \r\n\r\nThe story follows Woody and David Grant, played by Bruce Dern and Will Forte. Woody is David's alcoholic and possibly senile father. For years they never got along, and in his old age, the two still know very little about each other.But one day, Woody believes he has won a million dollars , though David quickly realizes its nothing more than an ad scam. But to give his dad some peace of mind, he decides to take him to Nebraska to cash the reward. Along the way they stop at Woody's home town where David slowly learns what kind of man Woody used to be and how he became the man he was. \r\n\r\nI have to say, I did't walk in with very high expectations. Although I'm a fan of Payne, I grew up not really knowing much about Dern and the trailers didn't exactly catch my attention. For the first 15 or so minutes I'll admit I wasn't very into it. But slowly, the movie won me over. When they get to Woody's home town the movie takes a turn for the best. We get to learn more about Woody and his family, and there are some great interactions and colorful characters. The movie spends the majority of the time there and I was pleasantly surprised how much I began to like Woody. You see all the people who influenced, liked, or even manipulated him and you see the reasons why he became so withdrawn and distant.  \r\n\r\nWhile the film does have its more serious moments, its mostly a comedy. Though thankfully its closer to earth and the humor feels more authentic and natural than in most films. I swear anyone who has extended family will feel like they have had these exact conversations with their relatives. Payne managed to somehow make this film feel incredibly real and funny at the same time. \r\n\r\nThe acting all around is great. Dern rightfully got the nomination, and Forte does very well contrasting Woody's eccentricity with his deadpan every man persona. June Squibb is freaking hilarious as Woody's wife and provides some of the funniest moments. But the real star is the cinematography and camera work. This film would not be nearly as good if it wasn't shot in black and white. I'm a sucker for this kind of film making, and the lack of color ads to the nostalgic and down to earth vibe that this film is going for. \r\n\r\nWhile this isn't the best film of the year, and it certainly didn't cover any new ground, I still enjoyed it. This is meant to be a father and son story, and on that note it succeeds.  \r\n\r\n**** ( out of 5)",

            "content": "So I think Nebraska is the funniest movie of 2013, edging out worthy contenders such as Wolf of Wall Street and The World's End. Directed by Alexander Payne and written by Bob Nelson, It's a very simple story but is so charming and well-written that it's hard not to love. Although it's been billed by some as a very 'dark' comedy, it's actually a pretty light-hearted fable on father-son relationships and small-town greed and gossip. True, it is a little sad and but it's also consistently funny throughout. It also manages to achieve moments of poignant sweetness, without ever swerving into the territory of mawkish sentimentality. \r\n \r\nIn a great performance, for which he was rightfully nominated for an Oscar, Bruce Dern plays Woody Grant, a curmudgeonly yet na\u00efve old drunk who has, by years of alcoholism, sullied his relationship with his two sons and his eccentric wife. Woody thinks he's hit the jackpot when he receives a blatant scam letter telling him he's won a $1 million prize. Despite the reasonable arguments of his family, Woody remains stubborn in his conviction that he has in fact won the money. Eventually, his youngest son, David(Will Forte) who is somewhat disillusioned with his own life, agrees to take his father to Lincoln where he must collect his ''winnings.'' Thus, an eccentric, existential and frequently hilarious journey begins. Things take an interesting turn as the pair make a stop at Hawthorne, Nebraska, (where Woody grew up) and the news spreads of Woody's recent fortune. Meanwhile, David sees the opportunity to learn about his fathers past and to mend their distant relationship.\r\n\r\nThe movie is shot in brilliant black and white, representing a sort of post-recession gloom that is ever-present. In it's comical portrayal of human greed and small-town gossip, the  movie is spot-on. Everyone in Nebraska has a friendly smile for Woody and congratulates him on his imaginary winnings, but it isn't long before they start pestering him for hand-outs. Stacy Keach gives a good performance as a snakey local claiming that Woody owes him money from years previous. The comedy in the movie is derived from a sheer truth and sharp observation that Alexander Payne's movies are known for. For example,when David asks his father why he ever decided to have children in the first place, he earns a prompt reply:\r\n\r\n'Cause I liked to screw and your mother's a catholic. You figure it out.'\r\n\r\nThe performances are solid throughout. Will Forte is good as a kind son who remains loyal to his stubborn and often very unlikeable father. June Squibb gives a hilarious performance as Woody's badgering, emasculating wife and she has some really great one-liners herself. The star of the show is of course Bruce Dern, who makes us sympathize with a character who's not always very easy to sympathize with.",

The plot it's what made me pick this one. yes, it's a road movie, yes, comedy, but when it's up with this nice story, these two generes create a good impression. Another point, the characters, even Breaking Bad's Saul Goodman has its merits. Even Will Forte (I didn't watched him in any movie so I could not tell). Since the most adorable character till the most despicable one. All the characters has something characteristic. I loved the direction as well as the sceenplay, they both unite in one self, which develops a new masterpiece in this 2013 and beyond... Or maybe in the last 20 years?

Tired of trying to stop him from walking, his son (Will Forte) agrees to drive him to Nebraska to claim his \"prize.\"  This plan doesn't sit well with Woody's nagging wife (June Squibb) and oldest son (Bob Odenkirk).  Regardless of his family's insistence that the sweepstakes is nothing more than a scam, Woody is determined to reach his destination and collect his earnings.  \n\nBruce Dern has been in the acting game for the longest time and he's one of Hollywood's legendary character actors.  It's amazing seeing him step into this lead role and deliver a magnificent performance as the hard-nosed and determined Woody.  This is the type of film that is anchored on the skills of the lead actor, simply because there's not a whole lot else going on.  Dern is fantastic, but he's also supported great by the likes of Will Forte, Stacy Keach, and June Squibb, amongst others.  Every actor featured in Nebraska blends in perfectly with the simplistic tone of the film.\n\nI'll admit, I wasn't really intrigued by the initial trailers for this film.  I only really became interested when it started gaining Oscar buzz.  It's not fast-paced, and the black and white style could turn people off.  However, aficionados of film should see this movie because it's so beautifully made.  It's a character piece that looks inside an American family and it oozes of emotion.  In a time where cinema is dominated by large-scale blockbusters, it's refreshing to see a movie like Nebraska come along.  4 stars.",

The genius in Bruce Dern's acting becomes obvious when you see interviews with him and realize that he is not a senile man.  The bewilderment in his eyes and complete helplessness to take care of himself make you believe that they just found this guy on the street and asked him to wander around a set.  Would I nominate him about Robert Redford in \"All Is Lost\" or some of the other impressive acting performances that were passed over in this strong year of movies?  Probably not, but his acting is truly impressive.  For me, the highlight of this film is June Squibb.  She just absolutely hilarious.  I ate up every single line that she delivered and found myself waiting for her to come back on screen.  While I understand why she did not win an Oscar against Jared Leto in \"Dallas Buyers Club,\" it was truly one of my favorite performances of the year.  Will Forte also offers a surprising good serious performance.  These three characters come to life so perfectly through the script.  The script for \"her\" was popular (and perhaps overrated even though I enjoyed the film), but I found \"Nebraska's\" to be much better.  I think that Alexander Paine is a genius for his use of extras in Montana, Wyoming, and Nebraska.  His selection of people who are salt-of-the-earth is a perfect compliment to the realistic characters.  The scenery and black-and-white filming are simple to allow the complexity of the characters to shine.  \"Nebraska\" is a great film, as indicated by its 6 nominations in such a strong Oscar class, but the field was just too close; still, this is a film that needs to be on everybody's list, from Squibb's hilarious lines to the very satisfying conclusion to the film.",

Director Alexander Payne handsomely paints this story through black-and-white lenses, while also providing some hysterical dialogue delivered by his actors, notably June Squibb who plays Dern's wife, who almost steals the entire show herself.

            "content": "Like fellow Oscar nominee David O. Russell, Alexander Payne has an extraordinary talent for bringing a sort of quirky, offbeat humor to his films and making them accessible to the mainstream.  There's usually a dark edge to the proceedings (his recent films include the excellent \"Sideways\" and \"The Descendants\"), but somehow the material never loses its humorous undertones.  \"Nebraska\" is his latest example.  It's a highly amusing yet also strangely touching tale of family and dreams and life in general, and it provides a high water mark for veteran character actor Bruce Dern.\n \nWoody Grant (Dern) is a crotchety, 80-something year old man residing in Billings, Montana.  One day he is found walking along the highway and is picked up by a traffic cop.  When he is asked where he is headed, he says that he is walking to Lincoln, Nebraska.  Woody's son David (Will Forte) is called to retrieve him, and the elder Grant explains that he needs to get to Nebraska to claim a $1 million prize he won in a mail sweepstakes.  This is, of course, one of those junk mail scams that is designed purely to get vulnerable people to purchase magazine subscriptions, but Woody is still hell-bent on making the journey.  And so, much to the dismay of Woody's wife Kate (June Squibb) and other son Ross (Bob Odenkirk), David volunteers to drive him down there to collect his prize.\n \nThis is interesting because, as we gradually come to learn, David does not have the best relationship with Woody, who was definitely never a nominee for Father of the Year (or Husband, for that matter).  We also come to suspect that, deep down on some level, Woody knows the whole thing is a sham.  He's elderly and seems to be approaching senility, but Dern's subtle performance hints that he may know more than he is letting on.  And obviously David knows the whole thing is a crock.\n \nSo then why make the journey?  Why indulge the old timer's fantasy?  Because it's important to him.  David realizes that this isn't about the money or Nebraska; it's about dreams and ambition.  It's about Woody's desire to get out and do something meaningful, and we soon realize that his motivations are not exactly selfish.  There is a lot simmering below Woody's surface, and David learns this as the film goes on.  We so often hear the adage that \"it's not about the destination, it's about the journey.\"  Woody's adventure is a perfect example of this.\n \nLike many of the 2013 Best Picture nominees, \"Nebraska\" works on multiple levels.  First and foremost, it's a story about the relationship between a father and son--just like real life, sometimes it's humorous, sometimes it's dramatic--but it's also a road trip comedy, a \"coming home\" film, and a family reunion movie.  The last two intertwine when Woody and David make a stop in the former's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska and they stay with Woody's brother and his family.  Kate also meets up with them when she takes a bus trip down; June Squibb is a delight throughout the movie, stealing every scene she's in, but she is especially wonderful during this segment of the film.\n \nKate is also not as one-dimensional as she seems at first glance.  Initially she comes off as a shrill, harping wife, but it's interesting to note that she's also the first one to come to Woody's defense when members of his family get wind of his \"fortune\" and begin swooping in, looking for hand-outs.  The two do not have an ideal marriage; you get the sense that, if not for deep religious beliefs, they would have divorced long ago, but there're still some feelings there.  Squibb has another great moment late in the film, when she makes this pretty clear.\n \nPayne has chosen to shoot this film in black-and-white, which feels appropriate and gives it a stark, old-timey feel.  This is especially perfect in the scenes set in Hawthorne, which give off an almost \"Andy Griffith\" Mayberry-like vibe, complete with residents who know everybody's first name and life story.  It also seems to give the more dramatic scenes a bit more heft; I can't really explain why that is, but it's probably the same reason that Spielberg chose to film \"Schindler's List\" the same way.\n \nThere isn't a false note anywhere in the performances.  Dern's Oscar-nominated work is truly great; some people may overlook it due to its understated nature, but I think that's the point.  Woody Grant is, if nothing else, a highly internalized man; as I mentioned above, there's a lot going on underneath the surface, and Dern manages to portray this brilliantly.  Not all Oscar-nominated performances have to be all flash and speech-making.  Dern manages to convey just as much with his soulful eyes and small frown than many actors do with wild gestures and raised voices.\n \nAs also noted above, Squibb is fantastic as well, and I also really enjoyed Will Forte's performance.  He seems to be yet another example of an SNL cast member making a successful transition to dramatic fare.  David is the key role in this story, and it's due to his actions that the movie ends on an absolutely pitch-perfect note.  Forte sells it wonderfully.\n \nAdd this one to the list of great 2013 Best Picture nominees.  I must say the Academy has done a bang-up job thus far.  Here's hoping that trend continues.",

Payne chooses veteran Bruce Dern to take on the lead role for the film. He plays Woody Grant, a father who is convinced he has won a million-dollar magazine sweepstakes in Omaha, Neb. The only problem is that Woody lives in Montana and is not allowed to drive. At the beginning of the film he tries walking to Nebraska, but his family members repeatedly come to rescue him. Dern, 77, is a knockout in the lead chair for this film; he plays the character with such instability and heartbreak. Dern received his second Oscar nomination because of his grand performance in this film. \n\nEven though Woody's past is blurred with drinking and hard times, his wife, Kate (June Squibb), calls him a damn fool for chasing this fantasy. Squibb is hilarious every time she is on screen. She does not put up with people's garbage and always throws in her 2 cents. Squibb was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress - in a Supporting Role. His youngest son, David (Will Forte), knows the sweepstake is a scam and tries to tell his dad that, but Woody will not have it. David shows compassion for his dad and decides to drive him to Nebraska. This is where our adventure begins with a father and son road trip to Nebraska. Their relationship starts out slim but deepens by the end of the film. This trip gives David an opportunity to get closer with his father by asking him questions about his childhood, seeing his old house where he grew up and even having a beer with his old man. \n\nPayne executes this brilliantly and sends a heartwarming and poetic message to viewers about family. One unique aspect to Nebraska was that it is shot completely in black and white. In my opinion, if this movie were in color, the film's value as a whole would have been lost. Another noteworthy performance is by a comedic Bob Odenkirk, who plays the oldest son, Ross. Payne has already shown his greatness with a list of remarkable films (Election, About Schmidt, Sideway and The Descendants) and now has added another great film to his canon. Throughout this film we journey with Woody all the way to Omaha seeing his highs and lows as a parent. \n\nEven though Woody has had a difficult past with his drinking, here we see a more optimistic Woody who is determined to get his million dollars in Nebraska and make a better name for himself, and more importantly, his family. Nebraska was nominated for six Oscars, but sadly the film did not win even one. That should not discourage the viewer, though, as Nebraska is still an excellent film. Through all of this black-and-white film, Nebraska still shines brightly with its poetic and heartwarming message.",

Forte explores the forgotten son who has stood by his alcoholic and confused father all his life. Squibb is excellent as the devoted, if nagging, wife. She's hilarious too. I have to mention Angela McEwan as well. She brought a charm and sweetness to the film if only on screen for several minutes. I like these kinds of dramas for their simplicity and yet loud voices.

The old lady talking about sex and the one-dimensional dumb Midwestern cousins bragging about driving fast were not believable and seem like things I've seen a million times before. The line \"See what you could have had if you hadn't talked about wheat all the time?\" was trying too hard. It would have been funnier if she didn't say anything about the guy or his history and just lifted her skirt and let the viewer wonder why she did that. Like when Ben Kingsley pissed on the floor in Sexy Beast. He didn't need to say anything. You knew he was a nasty man and the action just went well with his character. \n\nWill Forte was way funnier in MacGruber which got panned on this site for being crude and childish - but it had things in it that I have never seen before, such as the star reaching such a low that he assumed he needed to offer blow jobs to people (who didn't want them) to get his way.  Forte's character was downright boring in this movie. \n\nHis newsman brother Ross was boring too - another waste of talent because he was hilarious as Porno Gil in Curb Your Enthusiasm. \n\nBruce Dern's cranky old man lines were forgettable even if he is a good actor. \n\nThe story was not consistent - Bruce Dern's character was neither naive nor demented yet the story revolves around taking him to Lincoln to entertain his naive, demented idea of winning a prize. \n\nThe scenes of people not saying much were not funny. I was shocked the screenwriter was from the midwest. It felt like a script full of simple midwesterners by an east or west coaster who didn't know that there are plenty of non-stereotypical people in small towns. This movie could learn from Napolean Dynamite - a funny movie in a small town with characters and scenes unlike any seen before.\n\nSome good things: The small town bar felt real. Also, I liked the musical theme they kept playing. Stacy Keach was good. I could go either way on the black and white. \n\nOverall: A movie about a family driving from one midwestern town to another and returning to their roots could be interesting, but this movie wasn't.",

Alexander Payne's movie could easily have fallen under the grizzled old man genre that is quite common in Hollywood. Not that there were not good movies from this oeuvre: the wonderful Straight Story with Richard Farnsworth, Paul Newman in Nobody's Fool, and Henry Fonda in On Golden Pond. Payne paints on his canvas a black and white look at a man who never thought he amounted to much. Bruce Dern's Woody is not addled; he is just lost in a sea of regret because life goes by so quickly and sometimes offers very little except simple pleasures. It is a brilliant performance, and worthy of the nomination. He is matched though by Will Forte who plays the good son that has not found life to be everything he wanted it to be, yet he earnestly sets about  with somewhat reticent optimism. Something good might come of his dutiful way in life. This journey with father & son deals frankly with the gap between father & son. Even more succinct about the men in middle America who have very little options unless they want to leave their homes for greener pastures. June Squib plays the mother and definitely a salty take against the sentimentality  that lies in the subtext. In the end you will look at the film and realize that the glass was not half empty, but filled completely to the top. It is a lovely film and definitely brought a tear to my eye.",

Will Forte plays his son, who agrees to take him even though he knows that the million dollars is a scam. Nonetheless, Forte completely shocked me. The rest of the cast is also good.

About three quarters in the film won me over. Maybe it is the realism. I could not help but walk through certain personalities in my own life who remind me of the cranky and ornery Bruce Dern. The banter between Keach and Dern is more than genuinely funny, its a part of those relationships which make life worthwhile and entertaining. You know, the sort where two people become so comfortable with each other and their faults and habits and history that the line between words of love and insult becomes blurred. The kind of relationship where you spend every day yelling about how your partner keeps the toilet seat up and drinks straight out of the milk carton, but yet you both simply know that you could not live without the other. This is what made me laugh so hard, because I also couldn't help but picture myself growing in that same sort of relationship. In many respects I have already started down that road. \n\nThe film is also about the family that it exposes for the mundane routine that fuels these sort of relationships. As it follows an old man with a stubborn insistence on reaching Lincoln, Nebraska on foot so as to claim a million dollar prize that a common spam mail out informed him could be his, we are invited in on a rare opportunity for a family to revisit their roots and reexamine their lives together, missed opportunities and all. Secrets are revealed, and sparks are reignited. Memories are rehashed and honesty is wrestled with. And it all feels very real. The slow pace captures this realism and spins in to something that feels quite unrehearsed and undisciplined, but does so in a positive way. The results are revealing, sometimes humbling and challenging, and often times very humorous in a real life scenario kind of way. I especially enjoyed Forte's and Dern's slow growing dynamic and chemistry.",

            "content": "How well do you know your parents? This film was a surprising exploration of familial relationships and how we are often out of touch with our parents' lives before they became our parents. Woody Grant received a sweepstakes entry that says he \"won a million dollars\" and refuses to trust the post office to make that delivery, so he wants to go to Nebraska and hand deliver this letter. Despite his family's insistence that the letter is bogus somehow his son David is convinced to take him. They make some stops along the way and the most significant stop is in the town where Woody and his wife grew up. Through interaction with people from Woody's past David learns quite a lot about who his Dad was and why he is the man he is today. We are also given a shockingly accurate view of life in the Midwest. So much of it rings true. There were some scenes where I felt like they almost put a camera right in an actual family's living room, or in a small town bar. They aren't mocking life in these small Midwest towns, just accurately portraying it.\n\nBruce Dern seems to get a lot of credit for his portrayal of Woody. It was interesting to see how his quiet, stubborn personality started out as annoying to me (and his family) and yet he was transformed in my mind later in the film when we discover why he behaves in this manner. It doesn't seem like his acting style changed, though. He played the role very straight and nearly emotionless, it was merely the events around him that changed my perception of him. Will Forte was surprisingly good at playing David, because he doesn't feel like a comedian out of his element, he just feels like a son looking to spend some quality time with his Dad. He plays the straight moments well, and I believe he is intended to be our voice in the film as his reaction to everything going on was similar to my own. June Squibb was a surprising delight in the film. She is Woody's wife and doesn't exactly have a filter on her mouth. Some of the most humorous moments in the film are when she starts talking about her sex life without giving a second thought to the fact that her son may not want to hear it.\n\nI was totally surprised that I liked this film. It moves at a very slow pace, and that dragging tempo is only more accentuated by the fact that very little actually happens in the movie. This is more a study of the characters and how they interact as a family. It was also odd that the director decided to shoot in black-and-white. This makes the land and the towns feel slightly more drab and dull, which might have been part of the intent, but it seemed unnecessary. I think the reason the film worked for me is because there are so many themes that resonate for me, as they are things I have spent time thinking about in the past. I've dealt with aging grandparents and the idea of having to take care of my parents in the same way they did for my grandparents is kind of scary. Likewise I saw in my grandparents that battle to find meaning/purpose in life as they started aging, which I believe is a large part of the reason for Woody's mission. And lastly, I have often felt like I don't really know my parents. There are a number of times I'll listen to a story about their past and think \"Who were these people before they became Mom and Dad?!\" Nebraska spoke to me and challenged me to have some of those conversations even if they're uncomfortable, and you can't ask for much more from a movie than that.",

The slow pace and low production values were obviously chosen as a reflection of the characters in the film, and while it does work well, I found the majority of Nebraska to be a little bit boring. Having said that, it held my interest to the end, and there were a few things that made me chuckle, as well as a few touching moments. I watched this film with a friend of mine who is in his mid 60's, and he adored it, so perhaps I'll revisit Nebraska in a few decades and make another judgement then.",

Bruce Dern has his  great moments, but there is also a lot of him appropriately looking miserable.   It was Will Forte, to me, that gave the most interesting and full realized performance.   The one true negative about the film was the whole Stacy Keach subplot that didn't seem to quite fit in the movie.   I guess what I really lived is that there are small moments in that film that you can only truly appreciate if you group up in the middle states.   It's captures that life perfectly, and for this reason I'm surprised the hot shots in Hollywood have embraced it, but I'm glad they have.",

It could have easily been bleak and depressing, especially with its black and white cinematography and multiple aging characters. But there's a huge amount of heart underneath everything due to the silent father/doting son relationship of Woody (Bruce Dern) and David (Will Forte). It's not laugh out loud hysterical, but it's funny because it's so relatable.\n\nI really like movies about average (sometimes Midwestern) people because they feel the most real to life to me. Their problems may seem microscopic compared to those of a James Bond movie, but it's about how much they care about them that makes them feel genuine. David just wants his dad to live out one last fantasy and you slowly find out why Woody really wants all the money that he's probably never going to see. Despite almost all of her dialogue being belittling and insulting, you can tell David's mother (Julie Squibb) loves her family... now that's a remarkable performance.\n\nI really love the payoff and end of this film because you get so invested in Woody's fantasy money. You can look at it as never giving up in spite of losing circumstances or loving your family comes first. Nebraska is great and not to be missed.",

            "content": "This is a pretty damn great film.  It's great thanks to its simplicity and its approach to its story and its characters.  At first I thought the black and white cinematography was a little pretentious and didn't really serve any purpose, but thinking about the movie and how the film focuses on Woody's past and what made him the way he is now, the black and white makes perfect sense.  It also works really well set against the Nebraskan landscapes.  There's something very poetic about the setting and that certainly helps the movie a lot.  As mentioned, the film is beautifully shot, even if it's in black and white.  The acting and character development is top-notch.  Bruce Dern absolutely kills it in an understated and nuanced performance.  This is a man who has realized that his drinking throughout the years has had an effect on his marriage and his relationship with his sons and winning the sweepstakes is his way to make up for everything he did wrong.  But Bruce doesn't explicitly say any of this, you can just tell by the way he expresses himself and how he acts around his sons.  June Squibb, as Woody's wife, is the film's comedic core as the fact that she's suffered through Woody's alcohol addiction has made her the person she is at the moment the film start.  She's not afraid to speak her mind and talk ill of the dead.  She's absolutely hilarious but, again, I believe, she was also a victim of Woody's years of alcohol abuse.  As much, if not more, than her sons were.  And Will Forte is quite good here as well, as this son who's trying to spend some time with his father before he's completely incoherent.  There's this everyman quality to his performance here that makes his journey easy to relate to.  This is a great film, one that's a little more understated and quieter, but still a great movie nonetheless.  It's got a very sweet ending, but it's not done in an overly sentimental way.  It feels real and genuine.  I thought this film was great, it's not gonna be everybody's cup of tea, but the writing, acting and cinematography are all absolutely top-notch.",

            "content": "\"Why don't you take me?\"\r\n\r\n'Woody Grant' (Bruce Dern) is an old unhappy and rather empty man. He doesn't have much, his entire family see him as a reliability and joke - and his friends no better. So when the opportunity comes that he may have won $1 million dollars - he is adamant its real and he's going to get. Even when he's told time and time again its a scam, it's something he wants/must believe.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the film it paints him as a stubborn drunk - a man that isn't a particularly good dad or husband. But as things go on and 'David Grant' (Will Forte) begins to really get to know his dad, we learn this guy has had a hard life. And that's what the film is about a man looking for something to shout about and to feel good. All he wants is a truck and an air compressor. He was in the Korean war, possibly forced into his marriage and forever pleasing others while they screw him over. Granted not all this is shown outright as most is in the past but its clear from the actions of his family - loving wife despite her mean disposition.\r\n\r\nMuch like 'Inside Llewyn Davis' this is a film about a real person in a crappy life (granted in a different form). It's a simple story at heart but with a complex edge to it. Partly thanks to a stunningly quiet and thoughtful performance from 'Dern' and the wonderful original script. Both a beautiful film set in black and White an ugly one thanks to desolate towns that look ready for a tumbleweed to roll through. It has the perfect balance that removing the colour helps as well as putting more emphasis on Woody as a persona and his state of mind. \r\n\r\nNot only is it poignant and nice to look at its down right hilarious. 'June Squibb' who plays 'Kate', Woody's is on fine form with nearly every word out of her mouth getting a laugh. She delivers things with a quick blunt way elevated by the tone of her voice. Not only her but Woody himself, his friends the two creepy nephews. It's largely surprising how funny this film is and its not as if there are large gaps where it takes a break. The best thing is how its able to balance all its plates at once, and with such success. There are moments of pure shock, poignant and hilarity in one.\r\n\r\n'The Descendants' was a great film and I doubted 'Alexander Payne' could better that effort but he has and by some distance. A thoughtful, sad, hilarious and happy film that has joined the huge list of mesmerizing films of 2013. Its cinematography, its cast the script everything is carefully selected and perfectly so. I expected to like it but not love it, not just one of the year but it'll be one to add to my all time greats.",

            "content": "If he's not already there yet, there's no doubt that Alexander Payne is a director who is fast becoming a name that's synonymous with quality. I've yet to see his 1996 debut \"Citizen Ruth\" but from \"Election\" in 1999 to the \"The Descendants\" in 2012, Payne has delivered a consistency that few directors can match. With every film, he just gets better and better and \"Nebraska\" is no exception.\n\nAfter receiving a letter from the lottery sweepstakes, elderly Montana resident Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is convinced he's won $1 million and decides to travel to Nebraska to collect his prize. His son David (Will Forte)  realises that his fathers growing senility has gotten the better of him but decides to accompany him on the journey to look after him. As they make several stops along the way, David learns more about his father's distant past and how it's shaped the person he is now.\n\nAfter tackling the road-movie in \"About Schmidt\" and \"Sideways\" Payne successfully returns to that sub-genre. Like those aforementioned films he, once again, astutely focuses on the interaction between odd and eccentric individuals who are struggling to come to terms with how their life and relationships have worked out. The beauty of Payne's work is his palpable sense of realism and his consistent ability to capture believable character's in all their frailty and vulnerability and \"Nebraska\" is no different. In fact, it's arguably his finest work yet.\n\nWorking from a cleverly nuanced script by Bob Nelson, Payne's casting choices are what really stand out here. A lot has been said about the Oscar nominated performance of Bruce Dern and I can only add that the plaudits and superlatives this veteran actor has received are all very well deserved. Dern is simply marvellous as the cantankerous old-timer Woody, who's stubbornness and determination drives the narrative. That being said, as good as Dern is, he's not the only one on form here. As his patient and good-natured son, Will Forte delivers solid support and another veteran actor in Stacy Keach brings a reminder of his outstanding qualities and begs the question as to why his talents are not utilised more these days. Added this already fine line-up is the marvellous (and also Oscar nominated) June Squibb, as Woody's pugnacious and passionately pragmatic wife. With Jennifer Lawrence already gathering awards for her performance in \"American Hustle\" and Lupita N'yongo seemingly the viewers favourite for her performance in \"12 Years A Slave\", I'm very surprised at how little Squibb's work has been mentioned. I've made my mind up that this unsung actress deserves to go home with the coveted golden baldy. She really is that good. \n\nPrimarily, though, this a father/son relationship tale played against the backdrop of a satirical depiction of Americana and it's beautifully touched upon. For a film that has a seemingly sombre and melancholic appearance, it's actually a bittersweet and often hilarious examination of family dynamics, memories and the passing of time which is reflected wonderfully in Payne's decision to shoot in black & white. It's a very wise move and cinematographer Phedon Papamichael's desaturated look not only reflects ageing memories but also the character and mindset of Woody himself, with his outlook and opinion on life consisting of few grey areas.\n\nPayne has crafted a very rich and nuanced character study here, that's not only one of his finest moments but contains some of the best work by everyone involved and is rightly regarded as one the years best films.\n\nMark Walker",

Woody Grant, is a senior citizen who's seen the joyous times of his life pass by as he appears to be quietly withering away in the town of Billings, Montana. As of right now, he doesn't have much going for him, and he probably needs something to do just to give him something to do. At home, he has a wife, but she's not exactly the most calm person in the world and she has a mouth that would put even the most foul-mouthed sailors to shame with her raw takes on people (which are hilarious), life and an assortment of other things. So with that being the way that his daily life has turned out, the old man finds out that he may have struck it rich when he gets a letter saying that he's won a million dollars. This revelation has opened his eyes and is bringing him a large amount of joy that he hasn't experienced in seemingly forever, but he just has to find a way to get to Lincoln, Nebraska so he can get his hands on it. Since he doesn't have a car or any money to catch a plane, train or bus, getting there is going to be difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he's found himself in an interesting predicament, there's a younger man who lives in the same town with the Grant family blood running through his veins. His name is David, and he's one of the two sons that Woody had with his wife Kate. He has his own life, and it contains a few potentially life changing dilemmas that he has to deal with on his own. He loves his father, but he's probably the last person that wants to take on the responsibilities that Woody is offering at that particular time.That's mainly due to the difficulties of his personal life, but it may also have something to do with the way he and his father view the world. Woody is an idealist who's full of hope due to this winning ticket that he has, while David is more of a realist who simply tries to see everything for what it is. So, of course they butt heads a bit when it comes to the winning ticket that Woody currently has in his possession. David's cynical and honest view on life and the ticket doesn't sway Woody from moving on with his goal, and neither does anything else. All of the family members want him to just let it go, but Woody is determined to get what's rightfully his with or without their support. David senses his father's dedication to getting his one million dollar prize, and with the hopes of satisfying his desire, he reluctantly agrees to drive his pops to Nebraska to settle this once and for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe casting of Bruce Dern is very good I see why Oscar nominations were due for this film, including Will Forte, director Alexander Payne, scriptwriter Bob Nelson, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael and composer Bob Orton. The scenery of the Midwest becomes part of this family as though they have always been there in each straight line of the road. Music eases into the scenes and becomes one with everyone present. This is what America is about. People, places, and trying to blend the past with what is current, as in an auto body shop, once owned by someone Woody knew. Now, the mechanics speak Spanish and they have no idea who Woody is talking about. Hand-in-hand with the past and then hand-in-hand with the future, life goes on. I believe Nebraska deserves it's high praise for its modest approach to the father/son dynamic and its quietly moving sensibility.",

From its rustic dive bars to its weathered citizens, everything in Nebraska feels entirely authentic.

This is what Alexander Payne movie do, they touch you personally and make think. They make you feel, even if the exact subject isn't something you've gone thru personally, you can relate it something you have. Nebraska is Payne's best film so far and that is saying a lot considering his track record. Bruce Dern firmly belongs in best actor category this year and if not for such stiff competition, Will Forte would be there. But June Squib was by far my favorite part of this movie. As the the stern matriarch of the family, she has some of the best lines of the year not to mention the most memorable cemetery scene I can ever remember seeing.

His family realizes the letter is a scam to entice the recipient to order magazines but regardless, his son David (Will Forte) embarks on a road trip with his father that will become very memorable. Most critics rave about this film and I totally agree with Dave Calhoun's (Time Out) comment: \"\"An intimate road movie about one family that also lingers on the landscapes and fabric of an old-time, dying vision of the American Midwest\". In a nutshell that is the essence of this film! I found it depressing, making me think about the inevitability of old age and the hopelessness and boredom found in the town where the family resides. Oh God I could not live there! I am thankful to live in a city that thrills, delights, and captivates me. Never a dull moment in Los Angeles but Billings Montana, no can do. Will it win best picture of the year? Not a chance in my personal opinion. Solid acting by the cast members, the vast majority are senior citizens and I think director Payne did a great job of evoking feelings of nostalgia, sadness, despair and a little triumph at the end.

            "content": "It's interesting to think that there is actually someone who is eager to walk \"to\" Nebraska. Well, the occasions in which I'm not watching an unhealthy amount of films or listening to an unhealthy amount of music are often occupied by healthy walking, so maybe I'd be willing to migrate to the Midwest, just to get out of the house. It certainly helps if there's a $1 million sweepstakes win waiting for me... and if Lincoln, Nebraska, was recently named the \"Happiest & Healthiest\" city in America by Gallup-Healthways. Yeah, I reckon the city is pretty happy, but the people living there, not so much. Okay, I guess Nebraska is alright, it's just that there's not much to do there, which makes it fitting that Alexander Payne is making this film about Nebraska, seeing as how not much goes on in his films. No, I like most all of Payne's films pretty well, it's just that a lot of them run together, and I suppose that especially goes for this, which is \"About Schmidt 2\", complete with a plot about family dysfunction and old people problems, only this time, the color palette is in black-and-white. Man, that sounds about as exciting as, well, Nebraska, but relax, people, because this film about walking is worth sitting through, despite its flaws.\r\n\r\nBeing that this is an Alexander Payne film with a minimalist plot that is somehow crafted into a two-hour-long final product, it should come as no surprise that this film is slow, even in atmospheric momentum, taking a steady and dryly quiet approach to limp subject matter whose scripted interpretation has enough snap to keep things from getting too slow, yet can't completely make up for the bland spells that ensue when material for Payne to draw upon with his thoughtfulness lapses. Make no mistake, material lapses often, as limpness plagues both Payne's directorial performance and Bob Nelson's writing performance, dragging things out with more than a few aimless sessions of dialogue, much of which is more filler than consequential, just like Payne's other films. Really, with all of my rambling on and on about how this is a formulaic Alexander Payne film, its being so familiar is a big problem, for although Payne's formula still has enough juice in it to subtly compel the patient, too little is unique about this conventional Payne project, whose familiarity would be easier to forgive if the tropes didn't include the aforementioned questionable pacing, as well as some questionable characterization. Characterization is also classic Al Payne, with intentional thinness whose satirical wit is biting enough to endear, but carries holes in believability, while simplifying a character study that is simple enough in concept. There's a considerable charm to this film's simplicity, maybe even some, as Rotten Tomatoes' consensus puts it, elegance, but the fact of the matter is that this story is so simple, with limitations in potential that are stressed by the slow spells, familiarity and characterization thinness which would drive a lesser film into underwhelmingness. The strengths' being so subtle reflects a realization that endears consistently and thoroughly, until the film stands as yet another rewarding testament to Payne's skills as a minimal filmmaker, yet as with Payne's other projects, there's not much to make the final product all that strong, although there are plenty of questionable and familiar trademarks to Payne's storytelling that threaten to make this a relative misfire for the respectable filmmaker. In the end, however, Payne still manages to press the film on, maybe not where it stands out, even as much as some of Payne's earlier relative triumphs, but certainly to where you end up with a drama which even subtly endears stylistically.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most elegantly simplified aspect of this film is the black-and-white visual style, which is certainly lacking in liveliness, but about as hauntingly well-defined as the impeccably tight framing, fitting and adding to this tastefully minimalist drama so sharply that it immerses. Sure, most every immersive aspect to this naturalist opus sees great challenges within questionable storytelling aspects, but subtlety to recurring Alexander Payne collaborator Phedon Papamichael's cinematography, like most every other strength in this film, goes a long way in endearing as aesthetically appealing, as well as supplementary to the selling of minimalist engagement value that Alexander Payne drives, at least as director. Payne's trademark dryly thoughtful approach to intentionally limp subject matter is bland enough in its being so formulaic, and the many lapses in material momentum for Payne to meditate upon don't make matters any more gripping, but the film is far from dull, as Payne is once again able to get a fair degree of consistent entertainment value, punctuated by tenderly engaging dramatic licks. Payne's direction gets to be a little too subtle for its own good, but like I said, all of the subtle grace to Payne's direction goes a long way, because it's realized without getting pretentious, being simply comfortably thoughtful script that secures the final product from underwhelmingness because of its own subtle strengths. Bob Nelson's script is aimlessly draggy, formulaic and questionable developed, having questionable intentional flaws that do some damage to engagement value, yet are more-or-less compensated for by sharp dialogue and satirical, if thin characterization crafts memorable, maybe even overly familiar characters whose portrayers bring them to life. Granted, the onscreen performances aren't too much less subtle than the offscreen ones, but they endear just as thoroughly with their own subtle charm, and that particularly goes for the leads, with June Squibb and Will Forte being convincing as the struggling wife of a mentally distant senior, and as the caring, but personally flawed son of the same mentally distant senior, respectively, while Bruce Dern all but steals the show as the mentally distant senior himself, nailing the vacant charisma and very, very subtle layers that sell the confusion and price within the Woody Grant character. Yeah, it's all subtle this and subtle that, so, just like Payne's other films, this effort just isn't for everyone, but those willing to enter Payne's world yet again are sure to be endeared by the assurance, on and off of the screen, that make the final product rewarding.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the road, through all of the aimless dry and draggy spells and bland familiarity and simplicity, subtlety and grace to handsome visual style, thoughtful direction, clever writing and charismatic performance ultimately make Alexander Payne's \"Nebraska\" a comfortably realized and rewarding naturalist road dramedy.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

I'm a city girl!\"\n\nAlexander Payne has directed yet another powerful film by creating real characters going through real life situations in a very poignant and hilarious way. Nebraska is one of those films that manages to balance serious subject matters with light touches of comedy by creating characters from Midwestern American society that feel authentic and are easy to relate to. It's a heartwarming film with some very emotional dramatic moments that are taken to another level thanks to some strong performances. Bruce Dern stars in the role of a lifetime and his performance is so natural that he completely owns this movie and never misses a note. It's a difficult performance because due to the subject matter one wrong note could've made the audience feel like it was being manipulated, but it never does and Payne manages to direct his actors in such a way that I never felt he was being condescending. Will Forte also delivers in a strong dramatic role sharing great chemistry with Dern and making this a strong father-son road trip story that stands out above other such films. June Squibb is hilarious as well and she brings some comedic relief during some of the emotional or more dramatic moments. This road trip film is gorgeously captured through black and white cinematography giving the film a more nostalgic tone towards the past. It's a well balanced road film about old age and family, and one of Payne's best films (I'd rate it second, behind Sideways my personal favorite of his). This sad and tender film takes us through a journey that may be slow at times, but Payne makes sure he rewards his audience for sticking with it.\n\nWritten by Bob Nelson, Nebraska is an original screenplay centering on a Midwestern American family from Billings, Montana. The father, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) who's in his late 70's and approaching dementia, is convinced that he has won a million dollars after receiving a newsletter, but everyone else in his family knows it's just one of those scams for people to purchase magazine subscriptions. His wife Kate (June Squibb) can't convince him otherwise and neither can their two adult sons, Ross (Bob Odenkirk) and David (Will Forte). Since no one will take him to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his million dollars he tries to walk there. Finally David decides to call in sick at the electronic store where he works at and take his father to Lincoln. He believes this is a good opportunity to get closer to his estranged father who has always had alcohol related problems and been a very quiet person. Together they embark on the journey, but along the way they agree to stop by the small town in central Nebraska where his father grew up and meet up with their relatives. The trip becomes an illuminating experience for David who begins to understand some of the things that made his father the way he is, and through this unexpected journey the two grow closer together.\n\nThis could've been yet another forgettable father and son film, but thanks to Payne's unique style and deadpan humor along with Dern and Forte's powerful performances Nebraska is a beautiful and touching film. The tone of the film balances really well the family dynamics with the longing and yearning for the past mixed with the discomfort and emptiness of the present. Dern portrays this character so well and the final scenes he shares with Forte are touching and tender. It's a genuine story and in my opinion it's an improvement from Payne's previous film, The Descendants, which I enjoyed a little less than this one. Nebraksa is a very revealing film and I loved the way the father son relationship was slowly built without ever being manipulative.",

There is no wonder that was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, and Bruce Dern's Best Actor Award at the same festival was well deserved. If anyone out there was wondering why this movie has been also nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Payne, Best Actor for Dern, Best Supporting Actress for Squibb, and Best Original Screenplay, please, watch it! You won't be wondering anymore...\r\n\r\nThe story of Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) and his son, David (Will Forte), who is taking his father to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect a $1 million sweepstakes prize he has won was somehow out of this world... but so familiar! The craziness of taking his father on a trip when David already knew that the sweepstakes letter is a mail scam to make a person purchase magazine subscriptions seemed quite normal (of course there are few more elements to this story, like David's mother Kate portrayed by June Squibb who will make everything more realistic).  I love Payne's 'Sideways', but this one was completely different road film. When he saw this screenplay he asked to direct it himself but didn't want to follow-up one road trip movie (he was in already in pre-production of Sideways), with another. He decided to wait until after completing The Descendants to pick up this project. This was the first film of Payne's in which he was not directly involved in the screenwriting, and he rewrote only a few things prior to the beginning of filming. And if you want to see the screenwriter Bob Nelson - he appears as an extra in a restaurant scene.\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in black and white because Payne said he wanted to produce an \"iconic, archetypal look\", and at the same time he perfectly used the poetic power of the black and white in combination with the wonderful landscapes. I would like to mention that the choice of black and white was made against distributor Paramount Vantage's wishes, and there is a colour version  created in an effort to satisfy distributor's concerns. Payne stated that he hopes no one ever sees it.\r\n\r\nLike a cherry on top of this tasty film cake, there was the music composed by Tin Hat member Mark Orton. What a treat! \r\n\r\nGo ahead, and watch it as soon as possible if you like a good movie with nothing lacking!",

It's not a story of winning million dollar, it's the million dollar story to tell us how responsible about our aged parents we should be. \"Woody Grant\" (Bruce Dern) is one of us, a father with a lot of unachieved hopes trying to prove himself as alive even in his hangovers. He is beer addict, fanciful, but extremely simple-hearted and generous. \"David\" (Will Forte) also one of us, a son with his own life who refuses to put his father in a nursing home and tries kindly to make his father's dream down. Well, did he really believe he is about to become a lottery millionaire, or he intently ignoring the truth? Who cares about the money here? I guess I really fell in love with my parents again after it!\r\n\r\nWith no frills, Alexander Payne's Nebraska comes as a warm lovable black comedy painted in black and white with great cinematography, which never goes far away of Payne's long shots heavily detailed slow developed pictures. Yeah, it's about old-aged parents, with a lot of youth secrets of them revealed suddenly to the ears of their kids, and superb chemistry all over this family. Old joyful secrets in a tough time. Bruce Dern back to Oscar consideration after 25 years in his na\u00efve touching performance, with strong-languaged June Squib twinkling as a woman wants to keep her family, and a warm screenplay by Bob Nelson, though I felt nothing original in it. \r\n\r\nNebraska takes me back to the golden era of cinema, and proves me again that modest stories are the best.",

No questions asked, no moods explained, no futures discussed, no romantic nonsense, no major decisions to be made.  Things just happened.  Marrying was the only approved way to have sex, so marriage it was!  Kids were the logical consequence of having sex.  Work was the only way to support it all.

Life had nothing much more to offer other than knowing what was going on in everybody's' lives and the occasional gathering with your awkward family to watch a football game.

            "content": "It's deep into the Oscar season and I've begun my mad dash to get all of the Best Picture nominees watched before the big ceremony on March 2nd. Having seen Philomena, Captain Phillips, American Hustle and Dallas Buyers Club already, I next turned my attention to Alexander Payne's road trip dramedy \"Nebraska\", a pleasant little homage to family relationships and a sincere look at American existence.\n\nOne of the most interesting things about \"Nebraska\" is the cinematography. I'm not referring to the black-and-white the film is shot in, necessarily, either; Payne creates a sense of melancholy using wide shots of vast wildernesses and giving a sense of intimate grandeur to the small towns the Grants visit. The roadtrip \"Nebraska\" centers on is made to be a kind of synecdoche for American life as a whole, and contains many sentimental scenes where characters reflect on past experiences, victories and defeats, losses and failures, and seem to pass them off as \"that's the way it is\". Payne takes Bob Nelson's wonderful screenplay and lets its characters almost reflect on themselves; the acting is so natural the direction would be unnoticeable if the cinematography wasn't so good.\n\nThe film stars Bruce Dern as Woody Grant, a stubborn, near-senile old man who is excited to find a letter in his mail proclaiming that he could win a million dollars if he travels to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim his prize. His wife, Kate (June Squibb, in one of the most hilarious supporting performances in recent memory) and oldest son Ross (Bob Odenkirk, as awesome here as he was in Breaking Bad) dismiss his claims and tell him that it's a scam (it clearly is) and he should let it go, but his more sympathetic younger son, David (Will Forte on top subtlety form) tries to convince the other two that this may be the last opportunity at excitement Woody may ever have, and decides to drop his job (he sells TVs) for a few days and take his dad (against the wishes of the rest of his family) down to Nebraska.\n\nOn the way down to Nebraska, Woody gets into an accident and they are forced to stop in Woody's old hometown of Hawthorne, where Woody is basically forced against his will to visit old family members and friends, more than a few of whom he seems to owe something to. When Woody proudly tells everyone that he's soon to be a millionaire, the major conflict of the movie begins and what follows is a turbulent, sad, and powerful look at the selfishness and apathy of rural Americans and people in general. Whether or not Nelson and Payne's intent was to be satirical or sincere, the film is an excellent character study, with Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) providing one of the scariest human villains in a realistic drama for quite some time.\n\nAs Woody, Bruce Dern lives and exists as a character that doesn't seem to be acted in any way, proof of his masterful performance. Of the actors I've so far seen, he is probably the most deserving of the Best Actor Oscar (not to put down McConaughey, who will quite rightly win, and Christian Bale, who made American Hustle; I have not seen 12 Years a Slave or The Wolf of Wall Street Yet). His embodiment is at times hilarious, inspiring, pathetic, realistic, beautiful, artistic, and revealing. His relationship with his son David was for me the highlight of the movie, an honest depiction of a tumultuous but altogether loving connection that survives even in the hardest of times.\n\nI think at heart \"Nebraska\" is a comedy, because it doesn't lament on its lead characters flaws and ends in a happy (and surprising) way. There are horrible torments in between, but they are offset by multiple laugh-out-loud moments and some truly touching scenes. My favorite scene involves David and Ross stealing a compressor from a barn because they thought it was rightfully Woody's. What follows is absolutely hilarious.\n\nThe dialogue is a revelation, enough to make Bob Nelson deserving of an Original Screenplay Oscar if \"Her\" wasn't a thing. Squibb's dialogue is my favorite, and combined with some side-splitting moments with her in the film, makes her the best supporting actress I've so far seen this year.\n\nAs a whole, \"Nebraska\" is a masterpiece of writing, directing, acting, and celebrating life in general. Go see it and you will not be disappointed. It's the best American human drama since \"The Descendants\".",

The dialog was mostly flat and pedestrian (obviously not written by Alexander Payne, whose scripts usually have excellent dialog) and all of the actors' delivery were weirdly overacted, like a bunch of amateurs putting an unrealistic amount of inflection into their lines. (It's hard for me to describe it in words at the moment, but a good example can be seen with the doctor in Black Dynamite: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uUDMR_-tUk&t=30) Most of the characters were annoying and I didn't connect to a single one of them, aside from some brief moments of gratitude for Kate for telling things straight and shutting dumbasses up.\n\nBruce Dern was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for this?  He did fine, but his performance wasn't extraordinary, given what little he had to work with; I mean, half of his lines were \"WHAT?!\"  This Oscar slot would've been better off going to Joaquin Phoenix for Her.  I could say the same for June Squibb, who had some memorable lines but delivered them with the same weird fake exaggerated singsong style that was characteristic of this movie's acting.

            "content": "This movie did manage to capture the look and feel of small town America.  That said, it's way too slow and boring.  It moves at a snail's pace and nothing is really happening for like 90 percent of the time.  The movie doesn't really seem to have much of a point besides giving an old man one last thrill, one last walk down memory lane, and one last ride of glory.  The dialog was mostly flat and pedestrian (obviously not written by Alexander Payne, whose scripts usually have excellent dialog) and all of the actors' delivery were weirdly overacted, like a bunch of amateurs putting an unrealistic amount of inflection into their lines. (It's hard for me to describe it in words at the moment, but a good example can be seen with the doctor in Black Dynamite: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uUDMR_-tUk&t=30) Most of the characters were annoying and I didn't connect to a single one of them, aside from some brief moments of gratitude for Kate for telling things straight and shutting dumbasses up.\n\nBruce Dern was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for this?  He did fine, but his performance wasn't extraordinary, given what little he had to work with; I mean, half of his lines were \"WHAT?!\"  This Oscar slot would've been better off going to Joaquin Phoenix for Her.  I could say the same for June Squibb, who had some memorable lines but delivered them with the same weird fake exaggerated singsong style that was characteristic of this movie's acting.  Her Supporting Actress Oscar nomination should've gone to L\u00e9a Seydoux for Blue is the Warmest Color.  Hell, Nebraska's nomination for Best Picture should've gone to Blue is the Warmest Color.",

            "content": "Alexander Payne is a director who never forgot where he came from. I mean, why else would he shoot most of his movies in the state of Nebraska. He likes to make flicks about real people. He also likes to make flicks about people who look like real people, act like real people, and live in boring, realistic places. He does all of this while being totally beloved by the Academy. He's been nominated three times for best director (a list that includes the film I'm reviewing) and doesn't go for the jugular. He doesn't need special effects, shock value, gaudy camerawork, or beautiful Hollywood types to get his point across. No Payne is a good ol' fashioned filmmaker and with Nebraska, he provides another good ol' fashioned film going experience. With this November of 2013 release, he shoots everything in black and white. I'm not exactly sure why he does it nor do I wanna know the reason (I want it to be a mystery). But it doesn't matter though because frankly, it just works.\n\nAlso, as with his other triumphant trysts in the world of cinema (Sideways and About Schmidt being my personal favorites next to this one), Nebraska is yet another road trip movie. And I believe that Payne thinks of this as his comfort zone when it comes to fortifying his vision. In truth, I'm 100% on board with said vision.\n\nPenned by a first time screenwriter (Bob Nelson) and featuring characters who's lives are non-enriched, bleak, and not entirely promising (the black and white hue I feel, echos a lot of this), Nebraska tells the tale of Billings, Montana resident Woody Grant (Bruce Dern). He's I guess a retired mechanic, an on-again, off- again alcoholic, and a distant father to his two sons (David Grant played by Will Forte and Ross Grant played by Bob Odenkirk). When he finds out that he might have won a million dollars (through a letter that might be a scam), he then is bent on going to Lincoln, Nebraska to pick up his so-called winnings. Since his wife (played by June Squibb) won't drive him to Lincoln, he aids the help of his youngest son to get him there (Woody is forbidden to drive and it would take forever to walk 700 plus miles). As a road trip ensues, the rest of the Grant family eventually meets up (the older brother and mother take a bus instead) and rekindles their family history with their other relatives who live in the small town of Hawthorne, Nebraska. When these other relatives (certain people who are not part of the immediate family) find out that Woody is about to become rich, they want a piece of his winnings because well, he owes them some sort of prolonged debt.\n\nNow as much as I liked the middle America vibe I got from Nebraska, I couldn't quite render it a four star rating. The film's only oversight might be a few scenes that drag and a couple of scenes that mainly just feel like filler. The scenes that drag almost bring the two hour running time to a screeching halt. The scenes that act as filler are examples like Woody and his brothers watching football games and hardly saying a word to each other. I could do without the irreverence of those tidbits. But honestly, this flick as a whole doesn't really suffer from what I just mentioned. The audience with a keen sense of patience, will embrace what's on screen anyway.\n\nThe cast of Nebraska, (which consists of knowns and unknowns), comes up aces all around. Bruce Dern plays Grant with a low key stubbornness. He does a lot of reacting and doesn't go over the top. His performance as a comatose senior citizen, is Oscar worthy because at 77 years old, it doesn't even feel like he's acting. His style is so unassuming and it is so in the moment. To be honest, I haven't seen much of Dern's work but I know that he's been in the AEA union since the early sixties. That's gotta say something. Will Forte, who usually goes for the funny and plays goofballs (like in the little seen McGruber and some SNL stuff), is something of a revelation here. His David Grant is sort of a long lost daddy's boy who sees this road trip as a way to spend more time with his dad, and get to know more about what makes him tick. Forte, who matches Dern scene for scene, plays it serious with a level of disciplined perception. I don't know much about him or the facets of his career, but I do know that he is almost perfect for the role (my only stipulation is that he might have looked to young to play Squibb and Dern's character's son). As for June Squibb, she gives the best performance out of everybody. She comes on like a firecracker as Woody's nagging wife who still has his best interests at heart. Every scene she is in is a stealer. Her two best moments are visiting the family's graveyard in Hawthorne and telling off other members of the family who go after Woody hoping to get a piece of him financially.  Squibb just recently got nominated for best supporting actress in this role. I don't know if she'll win but I'm definitely pulling for her.\n\nFlawless acting stints aside, as you watch Nebraska, you figure out more and more that this is not a film about Woody getting his jackpot of a million dollars. What you see is the journey of the Grant clan sort of finding themselves. And the centralized part of that journey involves the vein of the father/son dynamic. The small town of Hawthorne, Nebraska provides the Grants with insight into their family roots, where they grew up, and their friends who seem to all know them from long ago. The character development safe to say, is exceptional here because we get a back story on pretty much everybody. Basically, all the players in Nebraska's setting look and act like your normal everyday Joes. No one and I mean no one who appears on screen, is underdeveloped or for a better word, unrealized. \n\nAll and all, the one thing I enjoyed most about this critical darling, is the ending. This ending, which puts a band aid on everything that's happened before it, will leave feeling lumpy and agog. In a sense, Nebraska has pitch perfect performances and direction that is careful and resounding. This to my liking, makes it a personable film with a giant heart. The movie poster which looks like Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits album cover, would persuade anyone to view this thing being that it has that old-world feel to it. And although the proceedings are slow at times giving the evocation of watching paint dry, it's a good kind of paint. Overall, Nebraska is another notch in the belt of Payne's heartfelt Nebraskan roots. Out of the 100 plus films that surfaced in 2013, this one is truly a keeper.",

The underlying story in interesting, but the execution is overwrought and condescending.  Also, the casting perplexes me.  Will Forte seems far too young to have a doddering father, which I'm surprised has not been mentioned by others.  The elderly mother was over-the-top crude (which was considered charming by some???  I don't get it.).  Meh.  Depressing and flat.  I was excited to see something that was refreshingly non-Hollywood.  Well, this wasn't \"Hollywood,\" but it surely was flat and colorless.",

I fell in love with the whole cast, Bruce Dern (who really deserves the best actor), Will Forte (in a plain but clear role), Bob Odenkirk (better call Saul), but most importantly June Squibb. Nebraska succeeds in painting the small town life, in which most never get out of. With themes of alcoholism and delusion coming from Bruce Dern, it's hard not to feel any empathy for the character, but at the same time I laughed out loud several times.",

Once again, he's managed to bring beauty to the simplicity of life's uglier side.  NEBRASKA is both insightful and thoughtful.  Stunningly shot in black & white, Payne, once again, wrings out natural performance from his entire cast.  As always in his films, there's a keen eye for authentic casting true to the mood and atmosphere of the story but  even more so to the setting of the film, in this case the rural Northwest.
