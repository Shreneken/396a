More dangers await them, including the skin-changer Beorn and the giant spiders of Milkwood. After escaping capture by the dangerous Wood Elves, Bilbo and the dwarves journey to Lake-town and, finally, to the Lonely Mountain, where they face the greatest danger of all: the fearsome dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch).",

The love triangle between Kili, Tauriel, and Legolas was a weird addition that wasn't remotely necessary, but I liked all of the other changes from the book. I especially appreciated the fleshing out of Bard's character, I think this movie does a great job of representing his character. I also really enjoyed the part with Smaug, I thought Benedict Cumberbatch did a great job of being this terrifying beast and Martin Freeman is great as Bilbo as well.",

We even saw this in The Two Towers. However, this one really doesn't do it. Martin Freeman is great again, Lee Pace gives such a menacingly ethereal performance, the dwarfs kept that great chemistry that they had in the last movie (even though there's even less focus on them than the first movie), and Luke Evans is a phenomenal Bard. And that's *furiously flips through notes* all the positives I've got. The additions of Tauriel and Legolas and the love triangle between the two of them and Kili (it's less of a love triangle and more of a love line with one point looking on longingly). Oh, and you know how it feels really tacked on and out of place? That's because it was a reshoot addition that was done behind those three actors' backs. So...there's that. The CGI and action is really hit or miss (that final fight with Smaug in the cave defies any remote laws of physics). Also, if you ever have even the slightest desire to watch the extended editions, just don't. They add absolutely nothing of value and anytime I saw something that was added in, I just thought \"why the hickety heck was this filmed in the first place?\"",

            "content": "Still very good, but I found 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' to be a step below the preceding 2012 release.\n\nThe conclusion is what affects it the most, in my opinion. It isn't anything bad, but it goes on for too long - yet the ending itself comes out of nowhere a little. It's iffily crafted, with the entertainment value not enough to cover it up. Again, nothing anywhere near terrible... just not as great as I wanted/expected.\n\nI also kinda wanted more scenes with Martin Freeman (Bilbo) across the midway point. I like the focus on Richard Armitage (Thorin) & Co. but I felt there needed to be more with the lead - and with Ian McKellen (Gandalf), for that matter.\n\nI've led with my negatives first, but I have many positives too. I enjoyed the scenes in Esgaroth with Luke Evans (Bard), all of the stuff there looks awesome. The character of Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly, is cool. Orlando Bloom (Legolas) remains fun to watch. Everything else, including the score, is very nicely done - as anticipated.\n\nLove the end credits song (\"I See Fire\") by Ed Sheeran, by the way. Not quite as grand and great as \"May It Be\" from LOTR, but it's pretty close!",

Sadly the film takes a few detours to showcase new characters, both liked and also some completely useless.

The characters are more fleshed out and you still root for them by the time the credits roll. Problem - again, it’s the problematic CGI - hazy and unfocused. But I’m unfairly comparing it to TLOTR series where they had actual props. The CGI isn’t noticeably off because whenever there is any, the scenes are fast moving, quick... which is another problem that I had, the disorienting camera work. I’m opposed with forced characters thrown in just for laughs. What I mean to say is that I hated the unibrow character - couldn’t they attempted to make the personality on the same lines as wormtongue. Instead we get this tongue-in-cheek character that’s as poorly introduced as the cosmetics they put on his face. Favorite scene - the river scene ",
