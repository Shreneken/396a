            "content": "Yet another master class piece of filmmaking from the great Asghar Farhadi. Both as director and as writer (along with Massoumeh Lahidji), Farhadi shows a deft hand at bringing to the screen with such authenticity very weighty issues and behavior of people everywhere when it comes to the dynamics of family, romantic relationships, and specifically infidelity. \nThe writing shows a highly perceptive grasp of the human psyche and how we will react/respond to the words and actions of others based on our needs and our relationship to them. Throw in the innate dangers of jealousy, presumption, fear, and depression, and the seeds are sown for very precarious developments. Key points that are revealed, such as who the now comatose wife took such hienous action in front of, or who was working the day Lucie called, shows the experience and maturity Farhadi has as a storyteller. \nThe layers of understanding, misunderstanding, guilt, misplaced and mistaken guilt, avoidance, and childhood fears and confusion played out in just over two hours are are well composed in the writing, but the actors are very impressive as well. Bejo (Marie-Anne) and Mosaffa (Ahmed) as the divorcing couple and Pauline Burlet as Lucie, Marie's daughter from another marriage, all give note worthy performances. The kids, Ouazani and Rahim are good as well.\nThe ambiguity in the final scene is appropriate as well. Are we, the viewers, optimistic, cynical, in denial, or lost in the past? 4.2 stars\nI'm never disappointed by this man.",

            "content": "Neither a joyful present nor a promising future awaits the one, who can't forget the past. Living in the past is the equivalent of not being able to live the moment. If we can solve our problems at the spot, we can start to manage our lives more successfully; but if we fail, the past always comes back to haunt us. Constructed this movie, he has both written and directed, around this idea, Asghar Farhadi made a great character analysis in \"The Past\". \nAs you may recall, the \"Best Foreign Language Film\" Academy Award winning director - with his film \"A Seperation\" - Asghar Farhadi, has been the guest of Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival recently. While Farhadi attended to this year's Cannes Film Festival with his film \"The Past\", Berenice Bejo won the \"Special Jury Award\", an event that was applauded by the cinema lovers. Stating that he admires the cinematography of Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Y?lmaz G\u00fcney, in this film, Farhadi turns his camera to the complicated relationship between a troubled French woman and her Iranian husband. Combining the elements, which he generally give shape using details, with different storytelling techniques, Farhadi turns a script with a simple essence into a complicated story. With his discursive storytelling style, he connects the main story to episodic byplays. He achieves this end via the family relations. \nDIRECTOR UNDERLINES HIS PREFERENCE ON CONTRADICTION\nDue to political and ethical issues, Farhadi shot this film, which has a half dramatic, half melodramatic storyline, in France. Therefore the film has received no influence from Iranian culture. While he has no intention to give a message, in reality, Farhadi has swept the message under the carpet, as if he tries to add a mystery to the message. Instead of positioning the story in view of audience's perception, Farhadi prefers a free storytelling method and tells audience to understand whatever they want. He really doesn't empathize with the audience; because he prefers contradictions. His choice on completing the overexposed and underexposed scenes with contrast colors is the most conspicuous evidence of this preference. If I may say so, this is some kind of a trick to emphasize that this film is a French production. Even, he makes his characters estranged from us through \"off screen\" sound technique. Sometimes we can't hear the cues of the characters. Trying to keep us in a distance from his characters, Farhadi makes it even harder by using long mise-en-sc\u00e8ne shots. As the phrase goes, the loud noise of the windshield wiper that gives the audience a headache and the extensive lighting that hurts the eyes within the long \"car\" mise-en-sc\u00e8ne makes us detached from the movie. \nLOGICAL FALLACIES AND THE CONFUSION OF THE CHARACTERS\nThere are so many logical fallacies in this 1:1:85 cinemascope film of Farhadi. For example, showing Marie's tendency to violence blatantly turns the high angle shot into an average scene. For this was an intended end, we are convinced that Farhadi's main aim here is to create contrast. Putting Iranian men up against Marie, the French character of the movie, is the best example for this fact. In my opinion, it's interesting that antipathetic French women and friendly Iranian men melted in the same pot in this film. However, if film was not turned into a complex family drama with emotional stresses and exhausting dialogues, it may have been a delightful movie. \nDrawing attention to the cultural conflict between French and Iranian characters, Farhadi relates Marie's dissatisfaction that leads to changing husbands frequently to her depression. Of course, Marie is too blind to detect her own depression. In fact, she claims that her lover's wife was in depression. Then, why does she always choose Iranian men? In my opinion, Marie doesn't know what she wants. And this indecisiveness has brought her into this current situation. Also a significant detail should not be forgotten: Marie is a selfish person. She is also prone to violence. For Marie, everything is like a game. Being too much preoccupied to a degree that she cannot see how twisted relationships, lies and schemes destroy her life, Marie, in fact, runs away, because she doesn't want to face her past. May be, the effects of the incidents, happened in her past, to her present are the factors that steals time from her future. Therefore, while living in seclusion, Marie has a private life, unknown to others. As we all know, if we don't solve our problems of the past fundamentally, we can't live today in its fullest; always some problem appears before us and when we try to cover our problems, we turn into someone like Marie. After all, is this not the reason of Marie's proneness to violence? \nMESSAGE FAILED TO BE UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY\nNow, let's see how this was reflected to the screen... After living separated from his wife for four years, Ahmad returns from Tehran to Paris, to complete the papers for the divorce. During this short visit, he notices the problematic relationship between his ex-wife Marie and her daughter Lucie. While trying to fix this problem, Ahmad will cause an important secret to be revealed. Also Ahmad feels a great sorrow due to the upcoming marriage of Marie wth another Iranian man. Thereby, the lives of two Iranian men intersect. Ok, it's a good thing having the paths of these two Iranian men get crossed, but the fact that the actor playing Samir, Marie's lover, is not actually an Iranian upset the applecart. Also, wrong expectations did not only wreck their lives, but kind of destroyed them. In my opinion, the characters behind the closed doors have no difference from the Pandora's Box. It's impossible for us to learn what they feel. We can't interpret their motivations. And just at that point, obscurity comes into play. As a matter of fact, the things experienced in the past were meant to be and they were right for the day. What gave shape to their current personalities and wisdom are that experiences. But the message failed to be understood correctly. \nLIKE FRENCH MOVIES WITH NO ENDING... \nAs a conclusion: While trying to stretch the story of a family, Farhadi disrupts the integrity of the film and therefore fails at the end. If we try to find out why Farhadi failed to give a proper ending to the movie after telling so many stories, the answer would be that Farhadi probably tried to end his film like typical French movies. For nothing has resolved, all is left to our interpretation. Some of us may have thought that the director has thrown a curve and some may have thought that all the themes presented on the screen were not given a shared conclusion. Then, did we watch this movie for nothing? No. We saw how a protagonist did hit rock bottom in detail. That side of the film was quite successful. Our comment is: a small change we make can make a great impact in our lives and bring magnificent changes to our future. Right moment, right time is right \"now\". We shouldn't lose time while we are at the right place and in the right time. I wonder, if Marie and her husband Ahmad had a chance to go back in time, what would they want to change with their current mindsets? That's a mystery... Enjoy the film!",

I know this structure is Farhadi's stock in trade, slowly revealing the details of an event the audience was not witness to through conversation, but this time I felt he went too far with it and I ended up losing sight of the story through the overabundance of plot.

            "content": "Iranian born director Asghar Farhadi's best Foreign Language Oscar winning feature length film from 2011, A Separation (at the time of writing ranked 102 on the IMDb Top 250) created quite the stir upon release, well and truly catapulting Farhadi into the western marketplace as a directing talent to watch. With Farhadi's experience as a playwright, A Separation displayed a deft hand at emotionally resonate and hard hitting dialogue and while personally I felt A Separation was overrated there was no denying its power in many respects. With Farhadi's latest Golden Globe nominated release The Past (or Le pass\u00e9 in its native tongue), this power is even more so present.\n\nOnce more as with A Separation, patience is required by the audience member to wade through what is a very long and at times unquestionably arduous 130 minute run time with a majority of proceedings taking place within the family home, the scope as a feature film is therefore very limited. While Farhadi's feature is dented by its quite solitary locations (no doubt relating back to his work within the stage production world) there is no denying the large arena in which Farhadi's script takes the participants of the film and us the audience to, in an often home hitting manner.\n\nFarhadi's script is in my books a large step up from A Separation and it's fantastically played out by his hugely impressive cast, no more so than everyone's favourite The Artist break out star Berenice Bejo as feisty and determined twice divorced mother figure Marie Brisson. Bejo shows a previously untapped skill in this picture and her performance showcases what could be a future Oscar winning leading lady mastering her craft. Marie is by no means an easy role, she is a hard person to warm to completely but there is enough within that makes her relatable and against all odds likable. Farhadi also struck gold with his casting of the ever good Tahar Rahim (a favourite of mine after his stunning work in A Prophet) as Marie's new squeeze Samir and there is a very impressive performance from teenage actress Pauline Burlet as Marie's daughter Lucie that in a Hollywood picture would have brought her far more plaudits. All these elements combine to make The Past very much a movie deserving to be on your to watch list.\n\nAs previously mentioned The Past is by no means an easy watch, I would compare it to sitting through A Separation or even Amour in terms of tone and pacing, yet it all comes together to create one of the most simply beautiful film endings in recent memories and a story that will inspire debate amongst film lovers. Once Farhadi combines technical filmmaking to go along with his world class script work the results will be quite mind blowing, yet as it stands there's still a whole lot to like about this talent who seems to have his finger on the pulse of the human condition as good as anyone else out there.\n\n3 and a half bottles of perfume out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check into - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

In fact, this film may portray an even more complicated set of moral questions than the films of the famous Belgians, and Farhadi adds an extra layer of complexity by placing all of the moral decisions in the past and showing us only the fallout. Each of the characters is compromised, without a full grasp on the truth (whatever that is), and the future is uncertain for their relationships.  Briefly, the plot is as follows:  Ahmad returns to France from Iran to sign the final divorce paperwork with his ex, Marie, which brings him back into contact with her two kids as well as with her new lover, Samir, and his son.  Her new lover's wife is in a coma and she may or may not die (they are looking for signs of responsiveness).  The plot unfolds from there - in fact, it just keeps unfolding and unfolding, just as life does.  Ahmad is clearly revisiting his past (having left France and Marie four years earlier) but Farhadi's reflections on the past's ability to influence us is much deeper than just showing us this unwelcome/nostalgic intrusion.   Indeed, we are all living with the past even if we are trying to live in the present or plan for the future - it's just that sometimes it comes to envelop or constrain us.",

As slow as the real life could be, this gem by the Oscar-winning director Asghar Farhadi is another proof of his mastery to turn a simple domestic drama into a slim and thought-provoking thriller.\n\nWhen Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) arrives from Tehran to France in order to finalize his divorce, he finds out that his soon-to-be-ex-wife Marie (Berenice Bejo) is in another relationship with a man. Even though Ahmad silently accepts this fact it soon becomes clear that Marie's family is tortured by a dark and somehow mysterious past. Totally focused on the past and the implications of past actions on their present and future, director Asghar Farhadi keeps himself close to what won his Oscar for A Separation. His slow, systematic psychological study of a dysfunctional family, while revealing a real-life mystery amidst the messiness of people's relationships is the finest possible example of exquisite film-making.\nThe real-life story slowly turns into a soft and mysterious thriller. Yet all the thrills are based on simplicity, feelings and assumptions that are real part of our lives. In comparison with A Separation, this Farhadi's delivery is not that gripping and polarizing, and its beginning is slower than expected. Nevertheless, the outstanding performances of Ali Mosaffa and Berenice Bejo (who delivers another memorable performance after The Artist) ensure that the viewers would be kept involved until the moment when the main mystery comes out from the depth of the story.\n\nThe Past is a mesmerizing movie by all means. Even if it no completely match to the Oscar-winning standard of A Separation, director Asghar Farhadi has managed once again to create a masterpiece via the simple depiction of human relationships and feelings. A must see for the lovers of art-house productions, this is a most welcome reminder that the Persian film-making is capable of delivering real gems.",

Once the central secret is revealed the film decides to become a mystery vs a human drama and then the proceedings just get more unbelievable as every twist gets revealed.\n\nThe performances are top-notch, though I wish Tahar Rahim was more commanding.  Rahim, so revelatory in \"A Prophet\", fails to really connect with the character cohesively so it's hard to imagine why Berenice Bejo is with him.  Her daughter implies a reason at one point but the film does nothing to explore that truth other than continue to imply it.  \n\n\"The Past\" is worth watching for several scenes that are powerful.  The scenes with young son Fouad are strong - and he becomes one of the more interesting characters in the film.  Ali Mosaffa is great as the soon-to-be ex-husband but you never quite know what drove the relationship to fall apart and the first half of the film where you follow him and how he causes the unravelling of this family is more interesting than the second half of the film.",

THE PAST is an extremely character-driven work. While the movie can be viewed and enjoyed by anyone, it will probably be received especially well by those with acting experience and those who are interested in the psychological aspects of drama. The story follows the events that take place when a French woman is visited by her Iranian ex-husband so as to finish a divorce settlement. Each central character - played respectively by Berenice Bejo and Ali Mosaffa - is strong in their own way, but are played to show their strength in different ways. Each actor remains conscious of their character's weaknesses as well. The conflict of the piece comes about when Mosaffa's character digs up issues from his ex-wife's past that affect her relationship with her new lover and her children. Over the course of the story, Farhadi takes a close look at family dysfunction and highlights the fact that one cannot usually move on from a situation unless they can feel that emotional issues from their past have been resolved. Skeletons always find their way out of the closet eventually. The movie's unique take on family drama that hones in on the psychology of dysfunction serves to provide a thoroughly satisfying dramatic experience. While THE PAST isn't perfect (it may feel a bit long for some audiences and it gravitates from character to character so much that it is difficult to identify a clear protagonist), it is indeed an adept exercise in pushing relationship-driven work to its most powerful ends.",

As the title indicates, \"The Past\" remains idle in a shared history with its characters who bear the weight of guilt and resentment that fuels this slow burn domestic drama. Ultimately, \"The Past\" explores the emotional damage that can incur when lines of communication inevitably break down.\r\n\r\nMarie (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo) and Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) are estranged spouses. Ahmad returns from Iran to France, where Marie lives, to finalize their divorce. When he arrives, he learns that Marie is living with Samir (Tahar Rahim), and Samir's young son, as well as with her own two children from a relationship previous to Ahmad. As Ahmad tries to make the best of his sometimes uncomfortable visit, he finds himself in the middle of several tumultuous situations. As the days pass, more about the lives of these people are revealed, and with considerable consequences.\r\n\r\nFarhadi's most complex and involving narrative to date provides a natural progression with no real plot twists while providing some unexpected turns. Teetering on the edge of contrived melodrama, the film builds towards a lackluster and formulaic finale that's nowhere nearly as compelling as Farhadi's uncanny ability to powerfully convey human insight and emotional turmoil. That being said, Farhardi's unsentimental and unforgiving approach ensures that this tale of domestic tension is in capable hands.",

The film was rich in political subtext, just like his latest masterwork, The Past, another tale of a couple parting ways. The language this time is French and the setting is Paris, but the process of separating remains as potently powerful and painful as ever. Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa, excellent) is in France from Tehran to begin the process of finalizing his divorce from Marie (Berenice Bejo). Because of a hotel mix-up, Ahmad has to stay in Marie's home with her and her three children, her two daughters from another father and her son who is the son of her current lover Samir (Tahar Rahim), whose own ex-wife lies in a coma. The plot sounds soap opera contrived, but do not underestimate Farhad's artistry and skill for imbuing palpable humanism into his film, a skill that transcends cheap melodrama. Bejo (an Oscar nominee for her beguiling performance in 2011's The Artist) delivers an indelible performance that digs deep into the secrets and deceptions that have haunted her all her life and through all her relationships. She's the standout in a beautifully affecting film that burns its way into your memory. Oscar missed out on another Farhadi masterpiece.",

I have always felt this way yet always known the only way to combat such tendencies is to better acquaint myself with more foreign films. I try to do so from time to time and when I heard Asghar Farhadi's much acclaimed follow-up to 2011's A Separation would finally be making it to my neck of the woods I was more than anxious to see what the director had crafted this time around. I remember being in awe of how well Farhadi's previous film was able to so easily capture and wrap me up in the simple issues of the family dynamic that was taking place in front of us and that the smallest of details, of changes in routine would be the event that spurned the main conflict the film was dissecting. It was such a simplistic, yet completely intriguing set-up that I wondered why films and namely those from my own country did not use this technique more often. Something such as The Past is an easy film to look at and see its obvious virtues, but these are only obvious because Farhadi has no doubt worked extremely hard to capture the naturalistic tone and conversation between these characters that allow it to feel effortless, as if we were simply observing the actions of these real human beings rather than the fact they were conjured up and plotted out by a singular source. When taking the film on from this perspective it is even easier to see the level of craft and skill involved in what the final version of this film presents and how well the characters have been realized because, as it is staged, we peel back the layers of who these average-seeming individuals are and the baggage they carry with them. It is truly a testament to the idea that each of us carry our own, interesting stories and that we all have something to tell though wouldn't want to necessarily share. The characters of The Past are that of people we could live next door to (despite the fact this takes place in France with influences from Iran) and their issues are those common enough to buy into the drama while complicated enough one wouldn't wish them on another. Through this power of simplistic, relatable narrative Farhadi has mastered the character drama.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.net",

It even covers some similar themes - along with the ever-present and unwelcoming obtrusiveness of the one stated in the title, there's the exploring of relationships / marriages both before, during, and after both parties drift from each other, and the forces that pull each away.\r\n\r\nWith A Separation, there's a central tragedy to the circumstances that seem utterly convincing and the personalities and dreams of each party prevent a compromise from actualizing. It's similar here, but even more electric and possibly scandalous, particularly with Berenice Bejo's Marie-Anna character. But the film is truly anchored with Ali Mosaffa's Ahmad, the man who comes back to Paris, from Iran, to complete his divorce from Marie-Anna, and gradually falls back into old dramas by pragmatically unspooling a mystery at the core of the film. It's fascinating, in a subtle manner, to watch, as the film is unafraid to confront the material, where lesser films might have their characters learn these secrets learned to their advantage, instead of disseminating to all parties and dealing with it, until the next plot development. It's mature, observed storytelling.\r\n\r\nThe problem is, the film goes about two or three \"reveals\" too many, stretching the believability of said central mystery and the emotions riding with it. And when the film veers from Ahmad as the audience surrogate, it loses momentum. Still, it's another expertly made movie that almost has a touch of Almodovar to it, with fine performances elevating the film from an ordinary, Euro-style relationship drama. Asghar Farhadi is going to make many more good movies.",

Asghar Farhadi is such an incredibly gifted writer/director, and being able to witness his work was a profoundly beautiful and honest experience for me. In The Past, he looks deep into the intertwining relationships of Marie, her ex-husband Ahmad, and her soon-to-be husband Samir. These relationships make up the emotional epicenter of the film, and the actors do a masterful job portraying their respective characters. Berenice Bejo stands at the center point throughout the film, but this is not to discredit Tahar Rahim or Ali Mosaffa, whose separate paths are just as compelling. But I think it is Pauline Burlet's portrayal of Lucie that really stuck out to me - she is in this constant state of vulnerability and fear throughout most of the film, and the way her facial expressions convey all her thoughts in less than a second... I was not expecting such depth from such a young actress. Easily one of the best performances in the film. The story, while it should remind the audience of any soap opera they've seen, is engaging and dramatic; when the story is not moving forward, the audience has time to watch these characters grow - and you really get a great sense of who they are by the end of the film. Otherwise, there is little in the form of music or sound design to praise... The camera just zooms in on the actors and we become lost in the beautiful disasters of their lives. As far as foreign films go, this is one that should not be too easily overlooked - it's a masterful mix of excellent acting and emotionally charged story telling, and further proof that Asghar Farhadi is more than just an average director.",

What happens to the characters in the film is left up to you to decide but you really don't care and by the time you leave the auditorium you have forgotten the film. The film is set in a suburb of Paris but you would never know as it doesn't feature anything in France except most of the language is in French.\n\nThe film is about relationships and there are many in this film starting with Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) arriving from Iran, his homeland, where he had returned 4 years before not returning, leaving his wife Marie (Berenice Bejo) who has asked him to come back to sign the divorce papers. She has a new lover, Samir (Tahar Rahim) whom she is pregnant by and who has a wife in a coma in the hospital after attempting suicide. Marie has two children Lucie (Pauline Burlet) and Lea (Jeanne Jestin) from her first husband who now lives in Brussels with his wife while Samir has a son Fouad (Elyes Aguis) who has found a friend in Lucie. The two girls have come to see Ahmand as a father figure and it is Lucie, the ever sullen teenager, who points out to him and says, \"Isn't it obvious? The reason she is with Samir is because he looks like you!\"\n\nWhy does Marie insist that Ahmand stay with her and doesn't book the hotel room he wanted? Why did Samir's wife attempt suicide and will she come out of her coma? Samir owns a cleaners and has an illegal female worker Niama (Sabrina Ouazani) who was involved in a fight between his wife and a customer and the wife attempted the suicide in front of the worker. Marie has a sprained wrist which she blames the painting and refurbishing of her home and has nothing to do with the movie.\n\nThe cast, in spite of being hindered by the director/writer, is more than adequate with Elyes Aguis as the young boy outstanding. Berenice Bejo who starred in  \"The Artist\" makes up for not talking in that film and is far from the happy dancing she played in that film. The men, Rahim and Mosaffa, are interesting to watch but, like all the characters in the film, neither their guilt, their relationships or why they do/did certain things are explained.\n\n\"The Past\" is too long by at least 20 minutes and though a movie doesn't have to provide answers it asks too many unanswerable, unnecessary questions.",

Once again working with a fairly straight-forward, reality-based premise as the subject for a drama, Farhadi is certainly proving to be one of the best voices in film, when it comes to examining familial relationships.  What makes this impressive is how gripping I have found his films to be, despite being incredibly limited as far as any sort of flashiness is concerned.  With The Past, there are no broad characters, the film has almost no music or score whatsoever, and the film's stakes are entirely personal to the specific people involved.  Still, The Past was another standout from 2013, as it is so great at being the film it is trying to be.\n\nread the whole review at thecodeiszeek.com",

They're not very successful, no surprise, and it serves as a perfect thematic symbol for what The Past represents - the things in life that get in the way and make communicating with loved ones a difficult, and at times seemingly impossible, task.\n\nThe Past is Iranian director Asghar Farhadi's follow-up to 2011's A Separation, one of the very best foreign films of the past decade that holds a coveted 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. While it doesn't quite achieve that film's masterpiece status, it is more than a worthy effort that firmly establishes Farhadi as one of the most exciting and dramatically adept directors in the world working today. How it didn't even make the shortlist for Best Foreign Film is beyond comprehension.\n\nThe two films also make for absorbing companions. Both use a messy divorce as a springboard into examining an intimate domestic setting more closely, gradually peeling back layer upon layer to reveal no person or situation is as cut and cry as it first appears. Relationships turn out to be incredibly complicated and cluttered. Characters rush to judgment without knowing the whole story and suffer devastating consequences. The past continually reverberates its ugly head in the present, hence the title. Emotional collateral damage is everywhere. And yet, startlingly and to its credit, The Past never settles for a simple defeatist attitude despite all the distress.\n\nIt wallops like a gut-punch, no question. There are scenes likely to make you wince. There's no music of any kind until the end credits, no easy relief or insinuation about how you're supposed to feel. The words and the silence in between those words are loud enough, exquisitely conveyed by the superb cast. The Past knows we all make mistakes and have faults, but it also knows healing is possible when we admit and take ownership of them. As the film's potently ambiguous final single-shot reveals, the choice on when and if it is irreparably late is up to you.",

            "content": "Asghar Farhadi is one of the best directors out there that can inject suspense out of an everyday problem that people have to deal with. His Oscar-winning feature film, A Separation (a near masterpiece) deals with couples on the brink of divorce in Iran. In The Past, divorce is still involved, but more importantly Farhadi chooses to tackle unresolved feelings from a divorce that has already happened. Falling just short of his first film, Farhadi still manages to craft a tense thriller/drama with The Past; if you cannot find some moment to relate to in this film, then you are a luckier person than most.\r\n\r\nThe film opens with Marie (The Artist's Berenice Bejo) picking up her soon-to-be divorced husband Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) from the airport. From the start you can tell that antimosity simmers below their actual dialogue with each other. Marie is resentful that Ahmad took off and never signed the divorce papers. Ahmad is frustrated that Marie has made Ahmad come home while Marie has started living with another man, Samir (Tahar Rahim) and his son Fouad (Elyes Aguis). Complicating matters more is that Marie has 2 daughters who have previous history with Ahmad, younger Lea (Jeanne Jestin) and older Lucie (Pauline Burlet), who has been staying out later at night since her mom started dating Samir. The cramped living space and anger from past events causes multiple revelations and personal history to come to the present to be dealt with and hopefully moved on from for all families involved.\r\n\r\nThe strength of The Past is its screenplay. Asghar Farhadi is already near the top of the list at creating slow developing stories that adjust the status quo from scene to scene, and The Past adds to his resume. He opens the film smartly by trying to have to characters talk to each other with a pane of glass between them (this happens repeatedly throughout the film), emphatically stating that although these people can see/understand each other, they cannot hear one another. Scene after scene, one character will dictate to another how they should react to a particular situation because that character thinks they have all of the information on hand. However, by the end of the scene, another card is on the table and the deck has to be reshuffled. Scenes like these give the actors plenty of chances to prove their action chops and for the story's direction to constantly shift. More importantly, most of these little revelations are totally believable as we learn more about each character and their motivations. Farhadi weaves all these scenes together seamlessly from the director's chair to build upon his theme of confronting the past and moving on, making the sum of The Past's screenplay, directing, and acting greater that its individual parts.\r\n\r\nThe Past also excels at ground this whole story in reality. The arguments stem from day-to-day struggles of parenting and responsibility. These arguments then shift into something between the characters involved in the arguments, which then cause a revelation by coercion or to hurt the other person in the argument. Characters get right to the point; people usually feel each other out and then say what they really want to say. The Past understands this more than most stories do, and uses this everyday occurrence to drive the tension and thrills in the story. \r\n\r\nThe acting supports Farhadi's screenplay. Berenice Bejo and Ali Mosaffa as the saddened angry patriarchs are very good. Bejo sells all the lies she tells herself and makes us feel sympathy for her being talked down to, exhibiting lots of strength as the provider for the kids. Mosaffa makes us believe he is a normally patient man but Marie increases his impatience exponentially. As someone who thinks hyper-rationally, I found myself thinking along Mosaffa's lines. Tahar Rahim doesn't get enough screen time, but he shines in the third act when he is needed most. Of the kids, Pauline Burlet carries emotional burdens better than most child actors, and little Elyes Aguis acts better without words than most other actors with their full arsenal of talents.\r\n\r\nThe Past is a powerful, relatable film. Anyone who has had to deal with warring family members or holds on to past burdens with hopes for a turnaround will feel a tug on the sadness in their heart after watching The Past. Asghar Farhadi is a talented filmmaker, but I hope he takes some time off and makes an equally compelling comedy so I don't have to prep myself to be sad after watching one of his films.",

Don't get me wrong, the film is brilliantly shot and well-written, and does deserve it's nominations, but it's nothing magnificent or anything that I will be mentioning to many people about.

Separation deals with the complexities on a\nreligious viewpoint, and requires swift, high-level decision-making and\nclever communication skills to undo what could go awry easily in many\nplaces. Le Passe's challenge is different in my opinion, it is about\nthe complications on relationship issues - something that is much more\nrelatable to many families out there - that always appear irrational,\ndevastating, and at times result in repercussions through generations.\n\nFarhadi's skills as a filmmaker is unmatched - every single moment in\nthis film is not wasted. His stories is like humanity itself, where\nthings do not appear as they are on the surface and there is always\nsomething that more than meets the eye. Similar to Separation, in Le\nPasse, we see layers upon layers of twists, uncertainties, and agenda\nunfold and it always ends up with the audience knowing that things\ncannot end with a simple solution. These factors, packed with\nimpeccable performances by the lead cast members, are fortunately very\nvery realistic (though a lot of shouting war was shown).\n\nThe combination of brilliant, intelligent storytelling and impressive\ndelivery of emotional performance is certainly what La vie d'Ad\u00e8le fail\nto match - Le Passe is my top film to win the foreign Oscars this year!",

It sets the new emotional high bar by which all other movies must now aspire. Director Asghar Farhadi presents the narrative unencumbered by elaborate devices. Sans music, costumes, special effects, flashbacks, nonlinear storytelling and other stylistic flourishes, he strips the production bare and serves it up to an audience for perusal. Much of the true feeling that percolates beneath the surface is evident not from dialogue, but from body language and gestures. The chronicle considers how we put up walls that impede effective communication. Once again, you think you know the story. As it unfolds, layers are exposed.

I think it's a great film and every bit as good as Asghar Farhadi's previous masterpiece, A Separation. \n\nAsghar Farhadi is intimately concerned with the drama of everyday life, of mothers and fathers and daughters and sons. No other film I can think of has such well-developed characters. There wasn't a point in the entire film where I didn't feel these characters were real. To watch The Past is to exercise our empathy. We know where each character is coming from and never feel that one character is more good or bad, more right or wrong, than the next. This is what A Separation did equally masterfully. The drama is so enticing as our empathy is fully engaged that I wondered throughout the film why these films aren't abundant in even mainstream cinema. I suppose that's not possible, but I think anyone could see this film and love it, even have their lives benefit from it.\n\nThe Past begins in the middle and ends in the middle. The story is not over when we leave and it has not just begun when we enter. There is an undercurrent throughout the film where family truth hides. This truth is revealed sometimes to twist the plot and other times it seeps out ever so slightly in the actor's expressions. Farhadi is a master of the screenplay and the story feels so well calculated because I think he understands that it's not about what is being said but what's not being said. \n\nThe film is carried by performance. Performances are remarkable all around, including and especially the young actors. They make the film worth repeat viewings. The camerawork almost never speaks for itself but for the actors. Farhadi is dedicated to performance and showing drama and turmoil through the actor's face, a very natural style of filmmaking but also a unique one because it's almost never done so well or felt so precise. We notice that they live in a real home with clutter and limited space. This is as far from studio filmmaking as you can get.\n\t\nFarhadi turns this great film into a greater film in the third act where he asks the audience to reflect on their own conflicts with their past. He's probably interested in your drama as much as he is the characters' on screen. Even though the story doesn't end, we are left with more than enough to reflect upon and we're never kept from the story by artistic pretense. It's one of 2013's best, and that's saying a lot.",

Marie (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo - The Artist) has asked her soon-to-be-ex Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa - Leila) to return to Paris to finalize a divorce AND to speak with her teenage daughter -- from a pre-Ahmad relationship -- about what is troubling her.  Lucie (Pauline Burlet - La Vie en Rose) simply wants nothing to do with her mother's new boyfriend Samir (Tahar Rahim - Un Prophet) and she voices her concerns to her one-time fatherly figure she clearly has much respect and affection for.  Marie still respects Ahmad and Samir doesn't know what to make of this.  Complicating the matter even more is that Samir is married but his wife is in a comatose vegetative state in a hospital after attempting suicide.  The film is in both French and Arabic so some might not want to watch this revealing and absorbing drama that continues to unfold and reveal secrets as it progresses.  I was a huge fan of Farhadi's Oscar-winning film (it was my #3 film of that year) but this one isn't as good ... and while that sounds like a huge put-down I must stress his other was a masterpiece and it would be like me suggesting only one Monet work is great.  The Past is a swiftly-moving modern drama about a dynamic and evolving relationship between four highly aware individuals ... although Marie is rather clueless about a thing or two.

His follow-up film is a fascinating look at a talented writer/director stretching by filming in a language and country not his own. Utilizing a fantastic, mostly-French cast (Iranian lead Ali Mosaffa purportedly learned French for the role), THE PAST is the story of a man traveling from Tehran to Paris to sign divorce papers with his ex-wife. Upon arrival, he realizes that he will have to stay with his ex and play mediator to a lot of very complicated drama.\n\nFrom there, the story becomes a beautifully modulated ensemble piece, equally dividing time between the estranged couple, her new boyfriend, and various children. Berenice Bejo, an Oscar nominee for her role in THE ARTIST, is sensational as Marie, the ex-wife. This is a rich, complex role, filled with quietly-suppressed rage, which she lets loose with a magnificent fury reminiscent of Isabelle Huppert. It's even more impressive to see such range from an actor famous for a silent romantic comedy. Mosaffa is quiet and sympathetic in his role, but the performances which resonate (aside from Bejo's) are those of Tahar Rahim (incredible in THE PROPHE) as the new boyfriend, Elyes Aguis as his conflicted young son, and Pauline Burlet (Young Edith Piaf in LA VIE EN ROSE) as Marie's eldest daughter who carries the weight of the world around on her shoulders.\n\nAll are given highly complex characters to play and each excel brilliantly. Aguis, in his debut, matches Rahim's stubbornness and intensity so that there is no doubt they are father and son. Rahim tows the line between blustering jerk and hugely sympathetic romantic lead. His last scene is a stunner, revealing the ache and conflicted emotions his character has been suppressing. Burlet suffers so intensely in this film, that it often becomes unbearable to even look at her. It's a true calling card performance.\nThere comes a point in the film where the machinations of the drama get to be too much. This is a bleak, dreary story along the lines of Woody Allen's INTERIORS. A lighter touch or some levity would have gone a long way. Too often, characters explain their feelings when showing them would have sufficed.\n\nAs good as he is with his actors, and as astute he is with his writing, Farhadi is still coming into his own as a visual stylist. His films resemble plays because his background is as a playwright. A SEPARATION did not have much of a visual style, but he's attempting to establish one with THE PAST. Many scenes feature our leads speaking behind glass so that we can't hear their conversations. As such, it's an effective motif, but I'm not sure it qualifies as a completely realized vision. Most other scenes are shot in a simple, utilitarian style. The final shot, however, suggests that Farhadi may evolve into a great visual artist as much as he's a great writer and director of actors. When all three come together, I expect astounding work from this highly promising filmmaker.",

            "content": "The Past is a brilliantly written down-to-earth story that stuns with its simplicity of human relationships, naturally talented actors and restrained, but extremely powerful dramatic load. As slow as the real life could be, this gem by the Oscar-winning director Asghar Farhadi is another proof of his mastery to turn a simple domestic drama into a slim and thought-provoking thriller.\n When Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) arrives from Tehran to France in order to finalize his divorce, he finds out that his soon-to-be-ex-wife Marie (Berenice Bejo) is in another relationship with a man. Even though Ahmad silently accepts this fact it soon becomes clear that Marie's family is tortured by a dark and somehow mysterious past. Totally focused on the past and the implications of past actions on their present and future, director Asghar Farhadi keeps himself close to what won his Oscar for A Separation. His slow, systematic psychological study of a dysfunctional family, while revealing a real-life mystery amidst the messiness of people's relationships is the finest possible example of exquisite film-making. \nThe real-life story slowly turns into a soft and mysterious thriller. Yet all the thrills are based on simplicity, feelings and assumptions that are real part of our lives. In comparison with A Separation, this Farhadi's delivery is not that gripping and polarizing, and its beginning is slower than expected. Nevertheless, the outstanding performances of Ali Mosaffa and Berenice Bejo (who delivers another memorable performance after The Artist) ensure that the viewers would be kept involved until the moment when the main mystery comes out from the depth of the story.\nThe Past is a mesmerizing movie by all means. Even if it no completely match to the Oscar-winning standard of A Separation, director Asghar Farhadi has managed once again to create a masterpiece via the simple depiction of human relationships and feelings. A must see for the lovers of art-house productions, this is a most welcome reminder that the Persian film-making is capable of delivering real gems.",

Relocating the milieu to France and signing up more internationally bankable names (Bejo replaced Marion Cotillard due to schedule conflicting), Farhadi has formulated a more universally relevant story to buttress his filmmaking journey, thus it transpires to be an astute move and the film is dedicatedly intriguing and unwaveringly laying stress on the fatigued moral yardstick gauging by modern standards. \n\nSimilar to A SEPARATION, this film is also triggered by a divorce, Ahmad (Mosaffa), an Iranian man, goes back to France after four year to accomplish the divorce procedure with his ex-wife Marie (Bejo), who is expecting to marry Samir (Rahim). During this period, Ahmad has to live under the same roof with Marie and Rahim, with two daughters Luci (Burlet) and L\u00e9a (Jestin) from Marie's first marriage, and Samir's son Fouad (Aguis). In order to suss out Luci's hostility towards the remarriage, a suicidal incident causes Samir's wife in a coma surfaces up and jeopardizes the lives of those who are involved.\n\nBarren with music (not until the end credits roll), Farhadi proves again he is a mastermind of singling out precise emotive nuances \u001bfrom domestic entanglements, minutely digs in the roots of the problems, teases out the best renditions from a first-rate cast and maximumly bypasses any sappy platitude which is concomitant with the drama set-up. DP Mahmoud Kalari examines the storyline with a steadier hand than in A SEPARATION, the transcendent ending shot single-handedly elevates the movie's soured stalemate to a plaintive eulogy to love's most instinct primitive force. \n\nThe performance is the film's strongest suit, Bejo deservingly won Best Actress in Cannes this year and her restrained volatility is awards-worthy. Mosaffa (the husband of actress Leila Hatami and a booming director himself) mostly appears as audience's on-screen proxy, leads us to unearth \"what had happened\" scenario, a busybody and a wannabe-hero in the mess. But the most admirable player here is Rahim, who is utterly composed and sidelined in the first half of the movie, but he is seething with ire and guilt in himself, a scarred psyche beyond redemption. \n\nBurlet (resembles a young Cotillard) and Aguis are glittering discoveries from the movie, Ouazani is pitch perfect in a limited but key role which alters the perception of the entire myth. Farhadi leaves many loose ends here, there is little elaboration on Ahmed's past and his background, and the truth about the suicide will lie forever with the comatose woman, but it is a highly accomplished woe of tale, relatable high and low, a gratifying follow-up after A SEPARATION and a solid brick of Farhadi's wall of fame!",

First watch I compared the wife-in-coma-bringing-everything-to-a-head to Alexander Payne's \"The Descendants\", which \"The Past\" is like kinda, but I think exclusively in that regard. Rewatching it I think this shares way more with the likes of Almodovar, specifically \"Talk to Her\" (which, hey, also has women in comas!) But really, \"The Past\" has just the same amount of melodrama as \"A Separation\", only without the inherently political obstacle course of the \"separation\" of that monumental achievement. The divorce between Marie (B\u00c3 (C)r\u00c3 (C)nice Bejo) and Ahmad (Ali Mosaffa) that kicks off \"The Past\" doesn't hang as heavy over the rest of the film as \"A Separation's\" does. It's really a movie about time and transition.\n\n\"A Separation\" announced the arrival of not only a new auteur, but a new country (Iran) whose cinematic output now demanded equally unique attention. That doesn't mean \"The Past\" should be treated as a fleeting work. To call it gossipy is missing the point. Where \"A Separation\" aimed for the head, \"The Past\" shoots for the heart. The mark is dead-on, the vision stunningly realized. It's Drama with a capital-D, but the substance is no less grade-A. Even if \"The Past\" does feel momentary (it doesn't) it's only because its dutifully bleak tension is something rare, enlightened, and, above all, alive. (87/100)",

Didn't surprise me that the film has been selected as the Iranian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards because it is probably the best that country had to offer at the moment.

He discovers that she is in a relationship with another man, an Arab man named Samir who has a son and whose wife is in a coma. The relationship of the older daughter and her mother is strained because the daughter disapproves of her mother's relationship with Samir... and you will gradually learn through the movie why, with a few unexpected twists in between.\r\n\r\nI would not expect that it will repeat the success of The Separation, mainly due to the much slower rhythm of the story, and the third part of the movie where the director decides to explain everything through packed events which are unfolding at front of our eyes changing the dynamics and taking a mystery out of the equation which was always present until then. That doesn't devaluate the movie, but takes some of the magic away...\r\n\r\nIf you are ready for a movie with excellent acting performances, captivating story, camera work and photography which are never taking attention from the events and the dialogue and are always perfect, grab something better than popcorn and sit down comfortably to enjoy over 2 hours of real art! :-)",

Although the film does seem long and tiring at times, when the film ends, you're left with a feeling of satisfaction. If you enjoyed A Seperation, this film as the same style. It's a VERY multiplex family drama, very haunting and saddening. Berenice Bejo, as usual, is beautiful and gives a beautiful performance as Marie. Ali Mosaffa gives a breakthrough performance as her ex-husband, Ahmad. Though her 'Artist' co-star, Jean Dujardin landed big Hollywood roles in 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' and 'The Monuments Men,' this year, Bejo has been relatively quiet. If you had any doubt in your mind that she wasn't great in 'The Artist,' this film showcases her versatility as an actress, and one that deserves recognition. Much like Marion Cotillard in' Rust and Bone' last year. The film is surely not for everyone, as it is very slow moving, not to say that you get bored at any point, but you become less engaged in the story as the film progresses and unfolds it's secrets piece by piece. Do you hate the antagonist? Sure as hell you do. Do you love the protagonists? Sure as hell you do. And how is that made possible? Careful character consideration by Asghar Farhadi, the director of the film, who has proved himself the master of anything, and everything pertaining to human drama. In trying to find a comparison to a film, it's hard to do, because this is a combination of so many. If I were to make an attempt, my best comparison would be \"A film on the emotional level of 'Blue is the Warmest Color,' with the pacing of 'Amour,' and the intensity, and awe of 'Incendies.\" 'The Past' is it's own film, and shouldn't be compared to any other, because it isn't like any other. It's beautiful, heartbreaking, complicated and I guarantee it, at the end of the film, you will be left in astonishment.",

The story starts out so simple, but quickly sucks you into its absorbing plot. I really like the themes of how an apology can sometimes not be enough, and that nothing is ever as black and white as it seems. Emotions and secrets can be very messy, and The Past (2013) explores it in the story of one woman with two previously failed marriages, and how it affects the children. Superbly acted and written, The Past (2013) is emotional roller coaster ride.",

It is no doubt one of the best of last year. \n\nEven though it runs over two hours in lengths, the pacing is lifted by the situational tension between our characters, as we want to grow closer and understand each of them better. Every character in this is facing some kind of anger, fear, or doubt. Director/Writer Asghar Farhadi isn't afraid of judging and punishing his characters. This makes it that much more real for us as an audience, giving us the opportunity of letting us decide how we feel about each one of them. \n\nSee this film. One of the most truthful, beautifully acted, and precisely shot films I have ever seen.",

            "content": "Wow.  Normally, I don't write an analysis for every single film I see, but I honestly found The Past to be one of my favorite films this year.  Unfortunately, the fact that it's a foreign film means a lot of people will be missing out on this unforgettable experience.  In sum, it's a story about a man who has returned to Paris in order to finalize a divorce with his wife who, in the meantime, is dating another man.  Her teenage daughter is in a shambles and frequently stays out late, unable to face her mother and the new man she has brought home with her.  Once her true father appears, the situation turns into a heavily intricate predicament.  Deceitfully, the film's premise might seem overly simplistic; I assure you it's definitely not but seeing how the most simplistic films strike box office gold anyways, I can't imagine why audiences would gripe about this one?  \n\n            Now, Americans, in particular, might not be familiar with the prevalence of a slower pace in European cinema.  Admittedly, I found myself struggling with some foreign motion pictures (Amour being a recent- and most popular- example) due to their sluggish pacing.  In The Past's case, all of its characters are so complex and the writing/storyline so brilliant that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  The grit and rawness is all there as is usual with European cinema and the realism so striking that the movie clearly serves a provocation of much thought and emotion.  Disappointedly so, I stumbled upon several comments on the narrative being annoyingly plodding.  \"Absolutely nothing crazy happens in my first hour and a half of watching!\"  Some are used to palpable conflict/action, but the action here transpires on an emotional level.  The impeccable acting does extremely well to service the script and- obviously- your investment in this intriguing tale.  \n\n           The morality isn't exactly black-and-white for the viewers to pick and choose which character is the charming, perfect hero of the story.  No, you're cast into this setting to study how real human beings would act in a parallel difficulty.  If you're not quite too keen on a single character, the events that occur throughout might possibly change your mind, and suddenly, you realize that you understand and sympathize with this devastated and damaged individual as he deals with the problem in a manner that he sees fit.  There's just no amount of praise that'd feel sufficient towards the remarkable quality of The Past.  This is an experience you likely won't locate all too often in the realms of Hollywood since the plot solely rely on its genuine recounting rather than the implementation of intense sequences in between more dialogue-heavy scenes for the sake of waking up some disinterested attendees.  Sometimes, we attend the movie theater for some fantastical fun, and other times, we attend it to explore some incredibly meaningful themes- films that engage us in more personal fashion.  All in all, The Past cannot be blatantly disregarded amidst a currently lively time of movies- releasing left and right- and I probably didn't give the film adequate justice, considering my unexpected and brief review, but I wrote it regardless so as to inform the film lovers of a magnificent presence that'll hopefully grace a theater near you sometime soon (if not, just wait for it on DVD/Blu-ray).",
