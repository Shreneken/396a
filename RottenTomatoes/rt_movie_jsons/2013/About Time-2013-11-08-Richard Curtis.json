It has great pacing for being two hours, a touching story, and it doesn't even screw up time travel! It has the most simple time rules and it doesn't try to do too much with them, very enjoyable and easy to follow. What is especially great about this movie, is its not so subtle, yet subtle lessons and messages about life. Such as sacrificing your own happiness for others, taking chances, cherishing every moment you're given and living life to it's fullest. Now I'm certain there are more lessons to be learned in there but these are what really stick out. This is a well done,  excellent film, with a lot of heart and meaning behind it.",

While the time travel aspect could make it a bit Sci Fi, it is certainly not a Sci Fi focused film.  It is a RomCom with a Sci Fi twist.  The plot was unique enough to keep you focused, the casting great, and pacing for the most part even. In fact, the only thing keeping it (imo) from a top score was that fact that I felt they stretched the film a bit and dropping one of the subplots would probably have made it a bit more enjoyable overall.

It's incredible that they made such an interesting movie despite mostly mediocre acting and a far fetched plot gimmick. \n\nBut the movie worked. It didn't take itself too seriously, and wasn't completely goofy either. It was a nice balance and something that I was surprised to see was made 9 years ago.\n\nMy wife didn't like it, she heard \"time travel\" and immediately dismissed it as sci fi and stopped paying attention.

Perhaps I wasn't paying full attention but it didn't really engross me enough to feel invested in it, hence my low-ish rate. I think some people will enjoy this but it won't appeal to all.

            "content": "About Time is a romantic comedy that abides themes such as living in the present. It is a beautiful movie that tells us so much about life and living every day to the fullest. This movie is not only about a love story, but more about the challenges of life and how important it is to show love to our family and the people around us at every given opportunity, without waiting before it's too late. It tells a lot about the son and father relationship, and it takes us to stir emotions with the most meaningful ping pong game, giving a sense of how little moments in life can mean a lot. About Time makes us reflect on life and how we are using our time, makes us question how we are showing love towards the ones we love, how we are making others' day better, etc. It shows how important is the way we approach our day, even simplest as it can be. Tim's father gives him the \"big secret\" on using this gift that they have. Still, Tim goes a little farther in learning about this, saying how he just tried to live every day as he would travel back to this one day, just to enjoy it, not needing to use his extraordinary gift at all.\n  About Time is a well-filmed movie that shows the reality of life. It has a story lesson and wants the audience to ponder about life. The casting is good, and although the authors did a good job, my favorite actor in this movie was Bill Nighy, who played the father. The film has a good intention, but I feel it lacks many things and could have improvements. First, the script uses some inappropriate language, which I would not recommend for a younger audience. Second, the movie repeatedly repeats many scenes because of the time-traveling, making the film seem long. Even if the director Richard Curtis wanted the film to have more of day-to-day life, it has a lot of unnecessary scenes, making the movie a little dull. Despite this criticism, this movie has a lot of sweet and funny scenes and has a story to learn from it. However, I would say it's not the best movie out there. I do recommend this movie, but do not expect something fantastic out of it. I would give it 3/5 stars.",

The message of the film teaches it's audience that what we think will make us happy stops us from stopping and smelling the roses of our already charmed life. Life is never easy but it is beautiful if one could learn to see the beauty in it. \nThe love story in this film is a beautiful love story. It's not a traditional Hollywood love story because it lacks all of the overused tropes like love triangles, ultimatums, forbidden love, infidelity, passionate love affairs, or anything like that. It's just two people who are perfectly suited for one another, falling in love, and falling more in love and gaining more respect for each other as the years goes on. This is the love story we should all want in our real lives and it's beautiful to see it on film. \nI never wanted the story to end and to say goodbye to these characters. \nThis will be my favourite movie for years to come as it has been since its release.",

Born to every advantage most people will never benefit from: a wonderful childhood in a peaceful home by the beach, loving, caring parents, money, money, money, guidance to future success and happiness, whiteness, and of course, time travel. \n\nAnd this is supposed to be enlightening? This is supposed to be sincere and endearing? I've never seen an easier path walked. And it calls into question the wisdom earned. \"Oh everything is just beautiful and wonderful, if you only pay attention!\" Not bad advice in and of itself.

Yes, it will, but it's just so... easy, on the face of it. Your relationship to your father is in the best possible shape it could ever be in, and he has lived several, SEVERAL, lifetimes already as he goes back to relive his life again and again. \n\nIt just doesn't feel earned.

However, we must enjoy every single day as it was the last one. \nAs in horror, in the huge rom-com field is really hard to find a good romantic comedy, that is why this movie feels even more special, because it's fresh in an industry where stories lots of times are rotten, soulful in a time where everything is done with economic intentions and in a loveless way, and at parts will get you laughing your ass off for its clever script.",

It tries to cover the darker stages in life as well, and how the character with his time travelling powers still have to go through them, but as negative as reality sometimes gets for most, it never becomes. \n\nAnd this is fine in my opinion. A movie doesn't have to fully cover reality. Apart from the time of movie About Time is, it's also an attempt to think about what possibilities there are if one had this specific type of time travelling power. \n\nThe movie tells a simple but original story, well thought through, fun and told in a beautiful way. It looks and feels different somehow, maybe because of the British setting. The interesting take in my opinion is that apart from the ability to travel through time, they attempt to keep everything else realistic.\n\nThe atmosphere keeps mostly the same. There are some quite funny moments, but About Time is not a movie that's intended to make it's audience roll out of their chairs laughing.\n\nThere are some insights on life shared, that as a viewer I felt one should take to heart, but it never gets overly idealistic or even preachy. They even put it in perspective themselves since the main character makes an alternative choice, which I found pretty interesting.\n\nI felt for the characters involved, who come over als believable. As a viewer, you don't get drawn in with them though. The only criticism I can think of is a little lack of character development. But I'm not sure if I needed this for the story the movie makers are trying to tell.\n\nYes, scifi-nerds will find problems in the way time traveling is implemented since the story ignores a lot of related problems. But it's a feel good movie, which doesn't need to get every philosophical point correct.",

On his 21st birthday, Tim (Gleeson) learns that he can travel back to anyday he can remember just because he can. So what does Tim choose to do with this extraordinary gift? Play the same days over to allow him to win over Mary (McAdams) by telling her what she wants to hear. That's essentially the entire movie and spoilers!\n\nThe story alludes to Tim, as a lawyer, uses this to win all his cases - and occasionally help others... but OMG can writer/director, Curtis really not find anything more creative for Tim to do? 20 years earlier, Ramis gave us a hundred different things that someone can do if they knew they could relive the same day over. Curtis could only think of three.... showing a true lack of creativity or imagination.\n\nIf you like predictable, Hallmark-ish, sappy romantic comedies -- than you just may like About Time.

No film is unique, and for sure there are similarities with other Richard Curtis films, but that is all. Plus to be compared to other great films is surely an honour.

You also can't really think about the central plot device, time travel, in any intermediate way. I often thought, \"but, how?\", \"but, why?\", \"but... I thought...?\" about Tim's various jumps and they often broke the rules set forth in the film - which for some reason his father doesn't tell him about immediately?

All the characters are completely lovable, and at the end of the movie I felt like I wanted to go back and visit my new family again. And to choose to live each day with joy. ",

It was difficult to me to get bored because of the different genres that you have. Every time something different happens on the movie that makes you want to know what happens next. \nAlso in my opinion the principal actors made a great job, like Domhnall Gleeson that wasn't a very recognized actor and Rachel McAdams made the perfect couple and made this film special.  The director made an awesome job too because it is difficult to organize something with this theme of going to the past and coming back to the present, without getting you confused.\nPersonally I learned a lot of things with ‘About Time', like for example everything that happens in our life is for a reason and when we make mistakes we learn about them so they are essential to make us progress. \nThat are the reasons you should watch this magnified and lovely movie. \n",

Domhall Gleeson plays an awkward 21-yr old law apprentice in London, when he learns from his father (Bill Nighy) that all of the men in his family have an extraordinary talent: time travel.  There are of course limits:  you can only travel within your lifetime, and only into the past, and if you travel earlier than when your offspring is conceived, your offspring from the future of that point will be a different person.  That last point is critical, because Tim (Gleeson) recognizes that once his 3rd child is conceived, he can never travel back to revisit his father, who is now deceased, without changing his child.  It's little details like that which make time-travel movies so much fun.  But Richard Curtis violates his own rules after he creates them, which causes a lot of confusion.  Clearly, if you can enjoy the characters on-screen without realizing the inconsistencies in the narration, you'll enjoy the film.  Nighy steals every scene he's in, he is so much fun to watch.  Rachel McAdams is Gleeson's eventual wife (after several meet-cute redo's) and McAdams is given virtually no character development to work with.  She's on-screen to smile and be reactionary to Gleeson's awkwardness.  She doesn't even attempt a British accent, even though everyone else in the cast is British-born.  This shortcoming is explained as being an American character in an essentially British film.  Worth the watch if you enjoy the actors; just don't try to think too hard about it.",

The concept of time travel in a romance seems at a glance as if it would diminish the intimacy and humor of such a beautiful genre of movies. Time Travel in this situation is used to create a romance like other romances but it doesn't feel like \"just another rom-com\" it feels new.

            "content": "At the age of 21, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) discovers he can travel in time... The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place...by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving from the Cornwall coast to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time-traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend from professional disaster and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. But as his unusual life progresses, Tim finds out that his unique gift can't save him from the sorrows and ups and downs that affect all families, everywhere. There are great limits to what time travel can achieve, and it can be dangerous too...\n\n\"About Time\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Beautifully filmed and unabashedly sincere, About Time finds director Richard Curtis at his most sentimental.\" Catherine Shoard of The Guardian compared the film to Groundhog Day noting it \"is about as close to home as a homage can get without calling in the copyright team\" and describes Domhnall Gleeson as a \"ginger Hugh Grant\", which \"at first, is unnerving; as About Time marches on, Gleeson's innate charm gleams through and this weird disconnection becomes quite compelling.\" Shoard gave the film 2 stars out of 5. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph praised the comic timing of McAdams and Gleeson, but criticised the film, comparing it to a quilt, calling it \"soft, frayed at the edges, and oh so comfortable\" and gives it a score of 3 stars out of 5. Leslie Felperin of Variety magazine called the film \"reassuringly bland\" and says there is sense of déjà vu especially for anyone who has seen The Time Traveler's Wife also co-starring McAdams. Unlike that film she has no knowledge of his powers, resulting in a \"fundamental lack of honesty in their relationship\". Felperin noted British reverse snobbery would put many off this and other Curtis films, but that this would be less of a problem among American Anglophiles and those willing to suspend disbelief, taking the characters as British \"versions of Woody Allen's Manhattanites (but with less angst)\". Felperin praised the chemistry of the leading couple \"that keeps the film aloft\" and the supporting cast, while also criticising the stock characters as being too familiar. The film became a surprise hit in South Korea, where it was watched by more than 3 million people, one of the highest numbers among the foreign romantic comedy movies released in Korea.\n\nThis is yet another sugary film from Richard Curtis with some ok thoughts on life and how we live it. However, I really disliked the first hour as the story was quite ridiculous with the time travel set up and Domhnall Gleeson is stuck in one expression more or less all the time and his relation and meeting with Rachel McAdams (lovely however) character is just too much in my book at least. The premise of the story is just seriously wishy washy, pretentiously romcomy and way too jumpy in the storyline. It´s actually only in the end of the film when Nighy´s character has passed away things become emotionally moving. And by then it´s too late to get emotionally engaged in the film. I think the cast is solid in general, Bill Nighy is always good and that needs to be mentioned. But, the characters leave a lot to wish for. \"About Time\" is simply too much Richard Curtis, meaning it´s too much, too long and too over the top with a bloody marzipan rose as the crown on a gigantic cake that makes you nauseous.",

I know this movie isn't perfect so it shouldn't really be a 5 star movie but it's one of my favorites and I just love everything about it so to me it is a 5 star movie. This movie is a perfect combination of a romantic drama with a little bit of a science fiction twist and the mixture is amazing together in this film. The plot is so brilliant and has some funny moments and some very sad tear jerking moments. It engaged me throughout the whole journey and I felt the connections that the characters in the movie felt it was a magical experience. The actors/actresses did a fantastic job as well Domhnall Gleeson gives a performance I loved and really connected with him and felt like you were in his shoes making certain life changing decisions, but the real star of the movie is Rachel McAdams she was amazing in this movie and in my opinion probably her best performance of her career. She was a great choice as the little insecure girl at the beginning falling in love with Tim.  Some more were Bill Nighy who provided some comedy relief in certain parts of the movie, also Lydia Wilson played Kit Kat very well for an actor I'm not very familiar with. The themes in this movie are also very important and work well with the movie structure. So About Time is an emotional journey of plenty ups and downs that really makes the audience connect with the story and the characters. The plot is outstandingly written, the actors did a fantastic job and the tone shifts are on point and really captures the right emotion for every single scene. In my eyes this is a perfect movie.",

Let s recap.\n\nSCOTT: We meet our hero, an Englishman named Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), who appears to be an ordinary, awkward 21-year-old until one day his father (Bill Nighy) tells him the big family secret: All the men in the family have the ability to go back in time. Tim decides to use this power to acquire the one thing that has always eluded him, namely, a girlfriend. He meets a wonderful American girl named Mary (Rachel McAdams), and after several time-travel trips (needed to erase his mistakes) he is able to win her heart.\n\nGREG: Scott, this is a nice, warm love story in the same category as  Notting Hill  or  Love, Actually  (all by the same writer / director Richard Curtis). Tim meets Mary at a dinner party and successfully gets her number.  But then he decides to travel back in time to fix a play by his father s playwright-friend Harry. When he does, he alters the events that lead up to meeting Mary. He then has to wait for Mary at a Kate Moss exhibit and when he does, he learns that she has a new boyfriend. So, he goes back in time and intercepts Mary before she meets the opposition. He then tries and tries again, working on his approach until he perfects it. She falls for him a second time.\n\nSCOTT: I agree that About Time is the sweetest, most endearing love story of the year. It reminds me of a 2006 Sandra Bullock film called The Lake House in that it is a romantic tale that incorporates elements of time travel. About Time is a stronger movie than The Lake House largely due to the remarkable performance of Domhnall Gleeson, who plays the role of a sweet, humble, love-starved man to perfection. We have a terrific ensemble performance here, with individually great actors forming a whole that exceeds its parts. Bill Nighy strikes just the right notes as the loveable, playful dad. Tim s sister Lydia (Lydia Wilson) is wacky, dysfunctional, but equally loveable. We even want to give the demented uncle (Richard Cordery) a big bear hug. And of course Rachel McAdams steals our hearts with her warm portrayal of a woman who is one of the few souls worthy of Tim s big heart. This movie exudes charm from start to finish.\n\nGREG: I thought About Time reminded me of Groundhog Day - one of your favorite movies, Scott. In it Bill Murray trips through time repeating the day over and over again trying to win the heart of the beautiful Andie McDowell. About Time is a wonderful hero s journey. Tim starts out as an ordinary young man who wants to win the heart of a young lady. He s given a special power from his mentor-dad. He then spends the summer trying to make it with a pretty girl, only to learn that even with time travel you cannot force someone to love you. Then he gets a new goal - to win the love of Mary. Things are going pretty well as he builds a relationship with his new love when something happens that turns his life upside down. He must then regroup and come up with a plan for making things right. He learns a life lesson that we can all take home. It s a complete mythological story in a modern setting.\n\nSCOTT: If I had to pick some nits, the rules of the time-travel superpower seem like rather arbitrary plot devices meant to manipulate our emotions. Also, About Time offers a confused message about how to live one s life. As we ve mentioned, there are scenes where Tim keeps repeating a day until he is able to produce just the right events to make a relationship with his future wife possible. The lesson appears to be that we should make strong efforts to impose our will on a situation rather than allow the events in our lives to unfold naturally. Yet there s another scene that suggests the opposite lesson. In this scene, natural circumstances lead Tim to encounter a woman named Charlotte whom he is trying to avoid. Even his time travel powers cannot prevent this encounter, although he tries using them anyway. It s clear that Tim s character needs to be tested by this encounter, and he passes the test, allowing him to transform as a character. This scene suggests that we should accept things that are either meant to happen or meant not to happen.\n\nGREG: I think that time travel is a superpower that everyone wants because we all feel regret. How often have you gone home after a party and wished you had said something slightly more clever to your boss - or some other person you wanted to impress? Time travel gives our hero (and therefore ourselves) the ability to go back and try it again (and again) until we get it right. And our hero Tim is a true virtuous hero as he doesn t try to gain fame or fortune for himself. He just wants to win the heart of a pretty girl. And remember, the writer establishes early in the film that try as you might, even time travel cannot make someone love you. They have to have it in them to begin with. And so Tim is really just getting what is rightfully his.\n\nSCOTT: I thoroughly enjoyed About Time from start to finish. The movie offers up a truly moving love story, not just between a man and a woman, but between a man and his father as well. There aren t many movies that leave me near tears at the end, but About Time left me with a lump in my throat the size of Tim s enormous heart. This film is the best love story in the movies in the past five years. I happily give About Time 4 Reels out of 5. As you ve noted, Greg, we have a wonderful hero transformation here, as Tim learns that you don t have to repeat a day to improve upon it -- you can simply allow it to unfold with all its flawed beauty permanently etched in time and with no need to change a thing. There is great mentoring, a stirring love, more than one great test of the hero s character, and a gift to be given to future generations of Tim s family. For this reason I award Tim 5 Heroes out of 5. Movie: Heroes:\n\nGREG: I agree with you Scott. Like other movies by the same writer, About Time is a touching love story with a message we can all take home. I had the luck to see it twice and it got better the second time around. I give About Time 4 out of 5 Reels and 5 out of 5 Heroes for Tim. Movie: Heroes:",

When what places we see that seeing doesn't matter we see we have plenty of time to try anything new in such places to meet those new. When what places we reach when other places don't matter are deeper places that we rely on when time to get to know one another makes us reach those places faster.

When we see that there are moments we can change and other moments we can't change when time doesn't see such places we don't know exists.

When we see what new places we might have others take within time, to see others places permanently gone when it's time to say goodbye. When we can choose to have all places that are dear to us when time gives us a chance to spend it with everyone within times grasps or go new places with those in what they want when we see eye to eye with them.

When we see time heals all that new places fills other missing places and we embark on the new time we have with those who go places, using time wisely and seeing one another before time is up and we end up in those other places. \n\nWhen what extra time and places we give to those we see that they use it wisely to not make the same mistakes as we did when time is precious.\n\n******************************************\nWhen we see ourselves inadequate among ordinary, extraordinary family and friends we begin to see how lucky we really are.

            "content": "\"About Time\" stars Domhnall Gleeson as Tim, a socially awkward young adult who finds out he can travel in time (inside his own timeline) and decides to use his powers to find love. The target of his pursuits is the also somewhat awkward Mary (Rachel McAdams). There are definitely some questions regarding the specific mechanics of time travel, however, it is not a big issue, since this is a romantic comedy with elements of time travel and not a sci-fi film about time travel. The key plot element seems to be the sort of self-induced \"Groundhog Day\" with Tim's repeated attempts to make Mary fall in love with him. Surprisingly, time travel does not actually happen that often. In the second half of the film it is only used two or three times.\n\nThis is a romantic comedy, meaning it has to tick two very important boxes: romance and comedy. There is definitely chemistry between the leads. Tim and Mary are very similar: they are both a bit socially awkward, shy, but also very witty. The dialogue between them highlights their similarities and feels very real. Romance: check. The dialogue is overall fantastic, laced with British dry wit. Contributing greatly to the comedy are the supporting characters surrounding Tim and Mary, like Tim's quirky free-spirited sister or his bitter playwright landlord. The scenes between Tim and his father (Bill Nighy) are some of the best in the film. Every character is unique and quirky almost to a fault. Comedy: check.\n\nHowever, the movie fails in plot and plot structure, which is rather unfortunate, considering the interesting concept. A tried and true format for films is to have a tense conflict that the protagonist tries to solve throughout the film despite the many obstacles thrown in his way. This keeps the audience invested in every scene. This film does not do that, but rather it is an episodic series of minor conflicts. The pattern is: a scene or two introducing the conflict, then a scene resolving the conflict, and then a scene or two of Tim and Mary just being in love. And repeat. The conflicts rarely revolve around their relationship. Be it good or not, but here we do not have the formulaic romantic comedy structure and on paper this format actually makes sense in keeping with the themes of the film - living life and appreciating its ups and downs. But this does not translate onto the screen very well. The lack of central tension results in boredom. Also, it means there isn't much of depth to the character of Tim. Therefore, when the movie ends, it just sort of happens.\n\nSpeaking of the ending, the similarities between this film and Richard Curtis' previous success \"Love Actually\" (2003) are very noticeable. Firstly, the ending of \"About Time\" is stylistically identical to the opening of \"Love Actually\", complete with a disembodied voice talking about life and love over shots of random residences of London. The plot's misgivings can also be traced back to the 2003 film. \"Love Actually\" is an ensemble comedy with each character having their own conflict and resolution. The lack of one central conflict works in that film, because there is also no central protagonist. \"About Time\", on the other hand, is a single protagonist film with a multi-protagonist structure.\n\nOverall, the film is enjoyable despite its shortcomings. There are plenty of embarrassing and hilarious situations that Tim finds himself in. As for those looking for romance - Tim and Mary's relationship is exactly what you want. But with a better structure to the plot and better use of the under-utilized time travel aspect, the film could have been so much more.",

            "content": "WHAT I LIKED: As a general rule, I think Richard Curtis is hugely under-appreciated as a film-maker, and nowhere is that more the case than where his 'About Time' is concerned. Now of course his overall reception is largely down to genre-prejudice, but for me this film is the best example of how he always balances everything so well, and in doing so creates a genuinely excellent movie that still largely gets critically forgotten.\nFor a start, About Time strikes the perfect balance between taking itself seriously, and having a bit of fun, and that exists both in the story itself, as well as in the tone of the film where different types of humour are used at all the right times to relieve from all the emotion. It is a silly plot after all, but it's yet again one that you can take a bit seriously because its characterisation and relationships are so well-built by Curtis and his amazing cast. The investment you have is nurtured too, as there's just the right levels of both soppy happy endings and difficult twists and turns to keep you there without swallowing you up or spitting you out. It's also paced rather elequently (which agreeably is something that can't be said for all of Curtis' ventures) and has some lovely themes that are yet again treated with the right level of exploritative seriousness and light-hearted whit too. Basically, About Time works because it's a proper balance between excellent 'rom' and brilliant 'com,' but putting those words together sadly puts some off before they even try it.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Maybe the silly (and often over-convenient) plot lose some sense of the relateable realities of love, life, and death, but if you take it as not-so-seriously as the movie does, you wont really mind at all.\nVERDICT: It's About Time people gave Richard Curtis a big pat on the back. He delivers his most balanced film here, and I really love it.",

One of my dearest friends recommended it, so I watched it one day, and by next day I had to rewatch it because I loved it so much!\n\n So, a brief synopsis (no spoilers! promise): The story is about Tim, a regular guy without luck in the love department. On his 21st birthday he finds out that all the men in his family have the ability to travel in time. But as Uncle Ben taught us: \"with a great power comes a great responsibility\", so he must use this for something good and can make his life better. Can you guess on what he's going to use it? YES! You guessed right! On getting a girlfriend. So this is only the beginning but soon Tim will find out about the complications of time travel and problems of everyday life.\n\n Now that you have the premise and have seen the scores and stuff, let me tell you what I think.\nFar from being pure science fiction or just another corny movie, it meets in between with a good balance of reality and fantasy. It makes us hope that we can live the way Tim does. It's the kind of movie you can enjoy every single time you watch it, not because it's the best movie ever! But because it explores our humanity through the humanity of the characters. Rather than make them strong or undefeatable, Curtis achieves what every filmmaker must: to show the vulnerability of a human being, with well rounded characters and not stereotyped. \n\n You see, About Time speaks to you about some things that we already know, stuff in the back of our minds, but it manages to bring it all together and remind us of the importance of enjoying life, and living it to the fullest. My dad would say that is a men's movie (like he said about The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) but I disagree (on both). Because it is not about just a man, it's more of the daily challenges and the big decisions that we have to make where we can all relate to that, not only men or only women, but every human being in touch with their emotions. An for me that's what makes it a great movie. \n\n To tell you the truth I have absolutely no idea how many times I've seen it! I just lost count of them after the first two. I almost made a party when Netflix uploaded it a few months ago! So that's me, I watch movies so many times I learn the dialogues (you can expect that of a child I know, but not at 25 years old)  \n\nFrom my blog: filmpressionist.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Is there anything more pleasant than a film that just makes you feel all warm inside? About Time, the latest from romantic comedy writer/director Richard Curtis, is one of those films. It's a delightful little experience that just oozes sentimentality and warmth, even when it delves into more serious subjects. The heart and soul of this film ultimately stems from the lead performance, that of Domhnall Gleeson. Gleeson nails every facet of this character that the story requires: his naive charm is irresistable, his aimlessness is relatable, and his comedic timing is on point. The comparisons between Gleeson and Hugh Grant are completely on-point. Alongside him, Rachel McAdams' own natural sense of charm is a perfect match for Gleeson, and the two work impeccably work together. Also worth mentioning is Bill Nighy, who is utterly perfect as the father figure to Gleeson's Tim. The sort of sci-fi aspect it brings to the table, the Tim's ability to travel back in time as he chooses, is more of an extension of the themes on hand than a gimmick, which is a refreshing change of pace that never detracts from the main romance. If there's anything to nitpick, its the blatant breaking of the time travel rules (established very early on in the film) in the break-into-three portion of the film, but its a plot hole that's so easily forgiven because of the pure joy this film is sure to instill.",

After I watched this movie,\nI become think about \"Time\" deeply. I really recommend this movie so I will introduce this story plot. This movie's leading actor can Time travel, but he can go only past time. So he often back to time to redo something.\nWhen he met a so nice girl, he couldn't do cool to her. So he back to past time and he redoing again and again. Because of this, he could get girl friend and also he got merry! I like this part of movie after merry.\nI think this movie's actor and actress is fantastic. This movie's heroine is Mary was played by Rachel McAdams. Her acting impressed me. Espacially when Mary was angry to baby, she was so impatiented, because Mary's baby made mess. So Mary was so angry. Rachel McAdams played this scene. It was so emotional. Her expression was great.\nAnd Domhnall Gleeson's acting also so nice. Domhnall Gleeson played Tim.\nI think his acting is mistrials and realistic. His crying scene was awesome. I was impressed.                                                                                                                                                            \n    This movie was made in British. So you can see beautiful scenery.\nIf you intrested in British, It's good movie. You can see British scenery.\nI recommend the party scene. The party scene is romantic.  You can see so nice British restaurant and town. After watch this movie I become want to go British. \n   Music surface, this movie's music is awesome. For example, \"Push the button\" is sung by Sugababes. This music is used in New york party scene.\nI like this song. I recommend it. Other is \"How long will I love you\" song by jon Boden and Sam Sweeney and Ben Coleman. This music also awesome. I often listen this music when I feel sad.\n   At the end, the movie of Last part is sprising. I cried a lot. I was impressed by the last part of words. Tim rearised importance of Time.\nI also noticed that how importance time is. After watch this movie I consider about daily life. I want to live every day in a meaningful way so that i will not regret it afterwards.",

            "content": "Entertaining low-key time travel/romance\n\nA recent book (Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film by Mark Strand) has announced the arrival of The Age of Twee. Twee, if I understand it, is a generational cultural movement like punk, but is more or less the opposite of punk, and to some extent a reaction against it. Where punk was cynical, gritty, defiant, aggressive, and disorderly, twee is sentimental, gentle, retiring, friendly, and innocent. If punk is a cold slice of leftover pepperoni pizza, twee is a fresh baked ginger cupcake with vanilla frosting.\n\nAbout Time seems an exemplar of The New Twee consciousness. This film set in contemporary Britain (Cornwall and London)is the story of Tim, the son of an eccentric family whose men have always had the ability to travel back through time, as his father (Bill Nighy) informs him on his 21st birthday. Understandably skeptical at first, Tim finds he actually can time travel, a talent he devotes mostly to trying, rather awkwardly, to manage his relationships with women, finally finding his true love in the form of an attractive though somewhat nerdy American girl, Mary (Rachel McAdams.)\n\nThe story is what might be called a \"soft\" time travel film: the time travel is effected simply by willing it, with no technology involved, and works only going into the past and back to the present starting point, so there are no science-fiction-like visions of the future. The movie emphasizes relationships over physics, and though it's frankly sentimental, and I thought a little long for the material, the script is intelligent and the acting very good.\n\nI think About Time would appeal to those who want to see a film that interestingly combines romantic comedy and time travel fantasy, and who don't mind if it's a little, or more than a little, \"twee.\" It may really be a three star film overall, but I'll add a fourth star for the film's exploration of some of the personal ethical implications of time travel, an issue which seems rarely considered in other time travel films I've seen. Advisory: ridiculously rated R for occasional language and a few explicit but fairly mild sex scenes. The Universal Blu-Ray disc is of very good quality; there is also a standard DVD available.",
