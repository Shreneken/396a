With a personal score to settle, Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) leads his people (Zachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Zoë Saldana) on a mission to capture a one-man weapon of mass destruction, thereby propelling all of them into an epic game of life and death.",

Anyhow, the notorious underwear scene with Alice Eve is okay despite what all the purists of the present day say. I could not believe my eyes when I saw the director with the tail between his legs begging \"the public\" not to cancel him for including this scene. It is totally innocent and just spiced things up a little in an otherwise sexless movie (Spok's girfriend does not count).",

I really liked the villain and what they did with Benedict Cumberbatch who always acts well, and I even liked Scotty much more this time around (who annoyed me in the previous installment).

I especially enjoyed the moments which showed why Kirk is the youngest captain in Star Fleet (The \"gather in this room according to protocol\" scene is a great example). \n\nWhile the action was over-the-top just like its predecessor, there were also some clever scenarios that I enjoyed diving into. The interpersonal relationships were deepened and the lore was broadened (love the Mudd reference), it just fell short of the first film. \n\nBest Character: Chekov\nBest Scene: Hand on the glass\nBest Quote: \"It's going to be okay, son.\" - Pike\nBest Piece of Score: London Calling",

However, the entire cast—including the \"guest\" stars—was excellent, and they all received quality scenes (except maybe Chekov and Sulu, who got short shrift this time out).

Khan is a truly fun and dangerous villain, an essential character to have in any film especially a good action film. If the villain isn't worthy or challenging then the whole experience feels dumbed down and bland and Khan certainly makes for a terrific and menacing villain. The rest of the ast are made up of mainly regulars from the first reboot film and include Chris Pine as Captain Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock and the rest of the primary characters as the crew of the Starship Enterprise. The film remains a little too unbelievable in it's story elements and the cliché of bringing someone dead back to life the way Bones brings back Kirk is simply brushed over as plausible and in no way is it. Still with some of these errors and swept-over writing in the script only briefly steers the film away from being a solid and thoroughly exciting and entertaining new chapter in the Star Trek universe. If you are a fan or you just like good action films then check out both of these reboots and prepare for an updated and well done adventure!",

None of that is present here.  Khan is little more than a physically-overpowered action figure, showing none of the menace of the original.  Spock, rather than using his intellect, is relegated to a long and unnecessary fist fight scene.  Worst of the reboots.",

There are some potential jump scares, with things happening suddenly and the plot, while I can't say I entirely followed it, was intriguing enough. However, my main issue with this film, as with other Star Trek films made recently, is the awful Scottish accent by Simon Pegg as Scotty. I say this as a Scottish person myself - its bad lol. However, that aside (and Chekov who I assume is Russian - their accent seemed a little...artificial too, although he's played by Anton Yelchin, who was a great actor (voices aside)), its quite a solid film. I didn't feel the somewhat ropey accents put me off the film entirely, thanks to the special effects and fast paced sequences. It features a decent cast, with (apart from Chris Pine, Zach Quinto and Zoe Saldana), Benedict Cumberbatch, Anton Yelchin and Noel Clarke. Also there is some fairly shaky camerawork present, although its needed to simulate the conditions the characters are in at the time I suppose but if you really don't like shaky or jerky camerawork then you may not enjoy this film.\n\nI would recommend this film overall, if the camerawork and accent issues don't put you off - its not perfect but its pretty decent - certainly entertaining and pretty gripping, if not without one or two gripes.",

Specifically, I recall having to stop watching after the first hour, and at that point I had nothing but positives to say about it. By the time the movie ended, however, I had only contempt for it. Once in a while a movie will choose to sacrifice all goodwill it receives, but this movie pushed at this harder than I have ever witnessed via three things taking place all in a short amount of time. First it performs insanely obtuse plot gymnastics to end up to a particular dramatic moment - Then it milks it out as long and aggressively as possible - And then it pulls a: \"Oh, hey - nevermind\" twist. And this twist is via a brutally cheap Cheat that makes no sense whatsoever, and would have massive consequences far beyond what are implied in the film itself (like, imagine if a time traveler gave gunpowder to the Roman Empire and then the story said \"Otherwise, History was completely the same\" when you know that this is impossible.\nIn the end I felt cheated by this film, and the ways that it cheats are the type that even children would likely find cheap as well. It's not the worst, but not at all recommended beyond the audio and visual spectacle.  It certainly looks and sounds great, not just in terms of post-production but the lighting and cinematography are solid as well, even if it was of the semi-monochromatic blockbusters, made shortly before that fad (fortunately) died.",

If you can't tell anything new about the characters on screen then don't tell anything at all. Worst of all, like every JJ Abrams' remake it misses the point of the original story; without adding anything new to the lore. \n\nAnd white-washing Khan is a cardinal sin, what is even the point of switching the original death of Spock to killing instead Kirk. And how does it hold any weight if the movie revives him 5 seconds later? With deux-machinima magic blood? As the original II: Wrath if Khan director called the remaks. It is a disappointing gimmick.\n\nStop rewarding lazy filmmakers like JJ Abrams.

I thought that this is one of my favorite sequels, it built beautifully on its predecessor and enlarged and expanded this rebooted universe. Chris Pine gives possibly his best performance, he improved from the last movie and you feel for him because his character motivations were already discovered in the last movie. Zachary Quinto was once again great as Spock, he uses logic very well and the battle for his emotions during this movie is so interesting to watch, especially when Pike dies, it is well done. Speaking of which Pike returns...for 20 minutes; they killed him off for emotional/motivational purposes, and it is used to great effect, but at the same time, I loved his character, he was so well written and played even better by Bruce Greenwood, I really missed him the rest of this movie. Zoe Saldana has a relationship with Spock in this film and their fighting seems kind of pointless because Spock is using logic to answer everything and it gets a bit stale, but Saldana was good with what she was given. Simon Pegg as Scotty is another character that I love, but he was sidelined for like 50 minutes, probably to make time for Alice Eve's character, and I missed him a lot, Pegg was great and his Scottish accent was pretty good as well. Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent as Khan, he was so menacing and he had a great emotional tie to the plot and Cumberbatch portrayed his emotion very nicely, he was strong and smart and I really enjoyed watching him, and I know everybody could tell who he was 5 minutes into the movie, but I didn't so it was exciting to see the big reveal. Peter Weller also was great and performed great, but you could tell that he was just there to be killed. Everyone else was good too. The plot of this movie is good enough and the visual effects are once again, the best in the business. The ending with Kirk dying is very powerful and brings me to tears every time, but it seemed a little lazy to such bring him back after 10 minutes. I loved this movie, almost as much as the first one, and it is a little more re-watchable just because you already know the origins of these characters. I would recommend this movie and will personally rewatch it many more times.",

Chris Pine as Kirk was definitely good, but Quinto lost a little something for me this time. And, while this may be a parallel Star Trek universe, the comparison's, albeit flipped a little, to the original Wrath of Khan, were just...weak. I rolled my eyes more than a few times. Visually, the film was beautiful, but the story was elementary, the dialogue was too full of unnecessary banter and bickering and the fight scenes were entirely over-choreographed. I now hesitate to see what JJ does with the Star Wars franchise, when I was ready to hand it all over to him. I guess he can't hurt what George was doing, but Star Trek Into Darkness seemed thrown together and, since the end takes them to the beginning of their 5-year mission to explore strange, new worlds, it doesn't seem like there will be a sequel.",

            "content": "In 1966 Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek as a TV series and coincidentally this was the same year that director J.J. Abrams was born. The show was pitched as a space Western in the vein of Wagon Train, which was a Western mystery show set on the Frontier. Star Trek converged with the start of the Vietnam War. Roddenberry had already seen action as a fighter pilot in World War II. To counter Vietnam, his version of Earth was a society without conflict and in space there were galactic truces, race relations and a sense of unity aboard the ship the Enterprise. As with any good Western, there was moral code of ethics between men, no matter how pointy their ears might have been. Roddenberry believed in a disciplined society that could be unaffected by war or religion. Spock for example was said to be modelled on a police Chief he knew when he was part of the LAPD.\n\nAfter many years as a TV show and dozens of films, someone decided Star Trek should be reinvented yet again and Abrams was hired to transform it into a glossy action film. As a filmmaker J.J. Abrams is somewhat of an enigma. One of his heroes growing up was Steven Spielberg. When he was a boy he was hired to repair some old film footage for him. Spielberg would later produce Abrams most personal film Super 8, a movie that typifies the director's career. Part of the film is a loving tribute to home movies and geek culture, while the other is a bombastic, overblown blockbuster, short of any personal imprint. He's a slick filmmaker, I enjoyed his TV show Alias until it became ridiculous, but he struggles to find the balance his idol has between action and character. Into Darkness is a better film than the messy 2009 film though. The best scenes overcome the generic, simplification of the action genre by retreating back towards the essence of the original show: a morally ambiguous grey zone, where the values of the characters and their races are tested. However, the characters are still bound by a rigid story structure, where at least ten elaborate set pieces take full precedence over the human and Vulcan drama. \n\nThe most interesting aspects of the plot are when Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Kirk (Chris Pine) butt heads over their different beliefs. Kirk is tasked with tracking down a rogue agent named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who is now essentially a terrorist bomber, causing havoc in London by using desperate people to do his bidding. This leaves a chilling, lasting impression, particularly when the film adds a layer of complexity, with Spock insisting that Harrison should be captured and trialled first. He's at odds with the order of the mission and Kirk, who wants revenge for the death of a colleague. Cumberbatch is frighteningly good in the film, a massive improvement over Eric Bana's villain in the first movie. The tension he brings through his menace, his arrogance but also his ability to cast doubts in the minds of the protagonists about who the baddies really are, is a magnetic quality that is hard to prepare for prior to seeing the film. What a terrific find he's become over the last few years. \n\nHowever, by ingraining itself in the structure of an action film, a lot of this ambiguity is undone. Whereas action and moral ethics fought and overlapped persistently in The Dark Knight, Into Darkness' rhythm is too discrete and foreseeable. The action is timed acutely to follow a stretch of exposition, dividing itself between moments of ideology and combat, and the emphasis on set pieces means the lines between good and evil become transparent again and remove the crucial shades of grey. Abrams also seems more interested in choreographing lavish action sequences than exploring the personal side of the drama. His imagination in the set pieces is limitless. He employs an array of frenzied techniques, including rapid cutting, tilting cameras, overhead shots and quick pans, to breeze through the action. Yet when the characters stop to face one another and talk his direction has none of the same flair or creativity. The actors sit or stand still, with the camera perched on their shoulders for dull reverse angle shots that don't heighten the tension. \n\nRarely do we ever see these characters in their downtime either. Without any inner life they become ciphers for voicing conflicting moral ideas, like instinct against logic or law and these conflicts are often resolved within a scene of one another. After watching Star Trek II: Wrath of Khan recently, which Into Darkness borrow from, it's also fascinating that Kirk is viewed as an ageing man who has to start thinking about death and his legacy. In this film he's more on par with Tony Stark, able to bed two alien girls with tails at once. That amplifies where they're aiming this film at, in spite of the occasionally intriguing layering of the story. For a franchise that prides itself on going where no man has gone before, the Enterprise is starting to travel in circles.No, it is not the \"Star Trek\" you grew up with...\n\n...and probably it isn't Star Trek at all. Like its 2009 predecessor, this movie is not the enlightened future Roddenberry envisioned and has more plot-holes than your average swiss-cheese. \n\nAnd again it really didn't matter to me, because it was just a fun ride. \n\nLike the first movie, I liked the action so much so (still way too much lens-flares, though), that many of the plot-holes only became obvious to me, after I took a few moments to think about the movie. But basically, if you can make a movie so entertaining, that you don't notice all the plot holes on your first watch and be entertained, it is still a good movie. \n\nI assume that is also the reason why the most reviews here either hate it or really like it: People who like the \"Star Trek\"-legacy and would like to see it continued are severely disappointed by this movie. But people who don't care about Roddenberrys \"better future\" or see the \"Star Trek\"-legacy as \"redshirts dying\", \"too tight uniforms\" and \"technobabble\", enjoy this flick as a good popcorn movie.\n\nSo if you still need to see this movie, do not expect \"Star Trek\"... expect the kind of action you wanted the \"Star Wars\" prequels to be.I must admit that when I walked into the crowded theater to watch J.J. Abrams' second journey into the 'Star Trek' universe, I was a bit apprehensive. The studio didn't hold any press screenings before the film was released on Wednesday. For some reason, the actual press screening was one hour later than the regular screening for paying audiences. Usually, studios do this when they know they have a terrible movie on their hands and don't want negative reviews published before opening day. Would that be the case here, or did Abrams simply want to keep the film's many secrets under wraps until it was released?\n\nI'll avoid specific spoilers in this review, and will try to talk more or less in generalities. First and foremost, know that I loved 'Star Trek into Darkness'. Abrams has conjured an action-packed thrill ride of a sequel with just enough heart to appease new fans of the franchise as well as old school Trekkies. I have no doubt that this will be one of the most successful films of the year, and won't be surprised if Paramount announces a third entry in the next few weeks.\n\n'Star Trek into Darkness' still takes place in Abrams' alternate 'Trek' timeline, established in his first film, but he continues to link the two continuities here as well. One of the things I love most about this sequel is that it's a story about how Kirk and Spock's friendship evolves. In this reboot of the franchise, we haven't seen Spock and Kirk become the friends that we know they'll be. Kirk is still young, cocky and brave, while Spock struggles with his half-Vulcan and half-human sides. These two Starfleet officers do not mix.\n\nThings start out with Kirk, McCoy and Spock on a primitive alien planet as a very large volcano is about to annihilate the entire landscape and its inhabitants. With this intense situation, Kirk does what he does best, by acting rogue and unwilling to follow the rules. Spock, of course, uses logic rather than emotion to accomplish the same task. From this, we see what their relationship is and what it could be. Later, Kirk is relieved of his Captain rank due to his insubordination, and is replaced by Commander Pike, who demotes him to First Officer.\n\nMeanwhile, a huge terrorist explosion destroys a bunch of buildings and kills a lot of people on Earth. At a Starfleet meeting led by Admiral Marcus (Peter \"RoboCop\" Weller), we learn that a man named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) is behind the bombing and has escaped to a far off, supposedly uninhabitable Klingon planet. The Enterprise is sent to capture him. However, there's much more to this story and Harrison than meets the eye.\n\nAbrams focuses more directly on the duo of Kirk and Spock this time around. While we have some good moments with other characters, they don't have much screen time and mostly serve for comic relief, which is done flawlessly and works in great references to the original films and TV show. And if you thought that the previous movie had a ton of action sequences and spectacular visual effects, you're in for a treat with this sequel, which turns the action up to Eleven.\n\nCumberbatch really shines here. You never know quite what to think about him, but he's truly a force to be reckoned with. Even though he's roughly the same size as everyone else in the film, he appears larger-than-life and is very terrifying. Quinto and Pine turn in stellar performances as well. This is maybe some of their best work to date, as we see both men struggle with their flaws and their friendship. I believe that the true core of this sequel is almost a love story, but one between two friends who are destined to do great things.\n\nSimon Pegg as Scotty has his own separate mission and is a key part of the movie. The humor he brings is much-needed and always welcome. Karl Urban never fails to impress as McCoy, the doctor who's always angry at something. It's amazing to see him flirt with some of the staff on the ship. Anton Yelchin's Checkov doesn't get a lot of screen time, but has a great scene involving his uniform. I believe Sulu (John Cho) will have a bigger role in upcoming films. In his brief time on screen, he demonstrates that he's capable of leading a starship. Zoe Saldana as Uhura serves as more of a comic relief role this time around. And of course Peter Weller puts his all on the table and is ruthless to a tee.\n\nI saw the movie in IMAX 3D. If you have the option to see this in IMAX, by all means do so. I truly felt like I was on the bridge of the Enterprise for the whole film. The sound was incredible. The 3D, however, is take-it-or-leave it. I didn't find it to be good or bad, just average. I would have much preferred to see the film in 2D.\n\nI can't wait until we have 'Star Trek' films where the Enterprise does what it's meant to do, which is go out into the beyond and explore new planets and life forms - to boldly go where no one has gone before. This isn't that movie, but I expect that the next one will be. 'Star Trek into Darkness' has tons of twist and turns and is on the highest level of entertainment. This is a remarkable sequel and I can't wait to see it again. This might be the most fun I'll have at the theater all year.This is another one of those engaging movies that I enjoyed watching. Engaging as in I find myself transported as if I am in it as an observer, immersed in the environs as it were. The set was realistically conceived, with the right amount of space-age trimmings and creative use of effects. The characters are interesting and delightful in their individual ways, and I find that each lends a different color into the story. And the soundtrack! I watched this on DVD, using an average 7.1 setup, and at one point I suddenly realize that I was so immersed in the visual and aural feasts that I was never once jarred out by the use of sound effects. In some other movies, they add those same, artificial heavy thumps repeatedly to give the impression they are action movies. Not this movie. Here the effects are used only at the right time and with the right characteristics within the context. The depth of the sound also matches the visual, so much so I felt the desired effects seen on the screen. And the big bonus is that this movie is wonderfully clean. No expletives, no gore and no ***.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Well Greg, we just boldly went where no two nerdy middle-aged reviewers have gone before -- to see Star Trek Into Darkness.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) That s right Scott. It s a bold new adventure for the rebooted franchise. Let s see if it lives up to the hype.\n\nSCOTT: The movie begins with the Enterprise saving the planet Nibiru from volcanic annihilation. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) rescues Commander Spock (Zachary Quinto) from the volcano, but in doing so Kirk reveals the starship to the planet s primitive inhabitants, thereby violating Starfleet s Prime Directive non-interference policy. Soon after returning to Starfleet, a secret Section 31 installation is destroyed by a former Starfleet agent named John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), who also attacks an emergency meeting at Starfleet Command, killing Admiral Pike.\n\nGREG: Kirk is now on a mission of revenge. He has been given the Enterprise to chase after Harrison who has hidden on the Klingon homeworld of Kronos. The Enterprise is fitted with 72 special photon torpedoes that Kirk has been ordered to rain down upon Harrison killing him. However, Kirk has a crisis of conscience and decides to take Harrison alive and return him to Starfleet to stand trial.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, this is a worthy successor to J. J. Abrams  2009 reboot of Star Trek, which I found to be a much-welcome rejuvenation of the sagging franchise. I have to admit that I was nervous about this next installment -- could it possibly live up to the high standard Abrams set in 2009? The answer for me is  not quite  but it s still a movie that is loads of fun. Here we have a story that smartly pays homage to the original Star Trek movie series while simultaneously carving out an original tale filled with action, adventure, and some surprises, too.\n\nGREG: I was not as impressed as you were, Scott. The movie is a technical marvel. The graphics, CGI, all the special effects are just amazing. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto did an excellent job of playing Kirk and Spock - even reproducing the close relationship that predecessors Shatner and Nimoy brought to the roles originally. However, the story left me wanting. Sure, there are a lot of nods to the humor and repartee that we had come to expect from the original series. But writers Orci, Kurtzman, and Lindelhof mined the second Star Trek film (Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan) for the plot elements for this new film. I was mildly disappointed when it was revealed that the fugitive Harrison was, in fact, Khan Noonein Singh. Surely, they could have found a new villain to fight in this alternative Star Trek universe?\n\nSCOTT: Greg, I m fine with the resurrection of Khan as a villain borrowed from the older timeline, especially since this rebooted Khan bears little resemblance to the original Khan. However, having said that, I would agree with you that future Star Trek movies had better not continue to recycle old characters and old plotlines, even if those elements are only mildly derivative of previous Trek movies. Let me tell you why I rate this movie so highly. In the 2009 Star Trek reboot, we witness a terrific hero transformation in the character of James T. Kirk. In that film he evolves from total loser to sensational heroic Captain. It was a classic hero story and it worked. In this current 2013 movie, both Kirk and Spock take center stage as heroes who become transformed in two ways: (1) as individuals who each gradually assumes the good qualities that the other has, and (2) as friends who develop a deep and unshakeable bond. I found this to be very moving.\n\nGREG: Scott, I agree with you on that point. The characters in this movie were given a lot more to do and we really got a sense of who they are relative to each other. Don t get me wrong, there is a lot to like about Star Trek Into Darkness. All the players brought their A-game. Still I think the writers and director J. J. Abrams went too far. They borrowed too much from the original. This is an all new franchise. There is an unnecessary cameo that does nothing to further the plot but pander to the fan-boys and possibly act as an in-movie advertisement for newcomers to the series to go back and watch the earlier movies. There is a reversal of roles in another key scene that I can only describe as ridiculous bordering on cute. And there are other annoyances that detracted from the seriousness of this reboot. Case in point is the cuddly character Keesner who follows Mr. Scott around. That creature could have been left out of the movie completely with no loss to the story. And why, oh why, does Uhura keep running from the bridge to sick bay and back again? Another problem I had with the film is that it isn t accessible to members of the audience who are not fans of the original series. There were scenes where Spock used the Vulcan Mind Meld and the FSNP (Famous Spock Neck Pinch) that went without explanation. I came across a great review by two Star Trek self-proclaimed  virgins  - their dialog was particularly telling as it exposed how the uninitiated had a hard time following the plot.\n\nSCOTT: Dammit, Greg, you re a reviewer, not a nit-picker. In every movie franchise, there are always a fews things that movie-makers assume the audience should know. Yes, Mr. Scott s cuddly sidekick should be thrown out the nearest airlock, but this character is on-screen for only 20 or 30 seconds. Yes, the older Spock makes a brief appearance, but he serves as an important mentor figure for the younger Spock. Besides, old Spock is looking so Jurassic we should throw him a bone here. My only issue with the movie was that its overall story arc was a bit fragmented, with one villain being the focus of attention, then a second villain, followed by a mission to save the ship, etc. I can forgive this imperfection because, overall, the conclusion of the film so very nicely calls back to the movie s opening sequence, and lessons are learned that forever cement one of the most important friendships in science fiction history.\n\nGREG: I enjoyed the development of the relationship between Kirk and Spock, but I wouldn t call this story an homage to the earlier series. It s more of a rip off. Still, I was entertained enough to see it twice, and try to unravel a couple of plot twists that eluded me the first time around. I give Star Trek Into Darkness 4 out of 5 Reels. Happily, I enjoyed the portrayal of the characters I had come to love by these new actors. The interplay between Kirk and Spock as they solidified their friendship was touching. Quinto s Spock is much more acerbic, which is a welcome coloring of the character. McCoy s constant hand-wringing and folksy metaphors were well-placed. New player Carol Marcus (Alice Eve) was also a nice touch. For a great transformation of a friendship, I give the movie 5 out of 5 Heroes. Movie: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: Greg, despite differing here and there in our impressions of this movie, it looks like we re giving the film the same rating. I also give Star Trek Into Darkness 4 Reels out of 5. It is exactly what people look for in a summer blockbuster -- action, adventure, humor, heroes, villains, and an emotional rollercoaster ride that ultimately leaves us satisfied. As you said, we witness our two heroes, Kirk and Spock, develop both as individual characters and as friends, despite vast cultural differences between them. I was torn between awarding them 4 or 5 Heroes but I think you ve convinced me to give them 5 as well. The supporting cast was superb, and I m curious how Kirk s character will continue to grow without a central mentor character who bit the dust in this film. Overall, I loved this movie, but the jury is still out on J. J. Abrams  rebooted universe until it shows me that it can deliver quality fare while also moving beyond the recycling of old elements from previous Star Trek releases. Movie: Heroes:",

Zoe Saldana (Nyota Uhura), Karl Urban (Leonard McCoy), Anton Yelchin (Pavel Chekov), and Simon Pegg (Montgomery Scott) are the standouts. Of course, Benedict Cumberbatch (Khan) is the standout. Heâ(TM)s a captivating villain who feels like a true threat in a way that you donâ(TM)t often get in these movies. I loved every scene involving him. The spectacle of this movie is top notch. There are vibrant visuals that are breathtaking. Itâ(TM)s especially true in the opening sequence. The action is honestly pretty nonstop and always exciting.\n\nWeaknesses: The script could be tighter. There are some plot holes and things get muddled throughout the course of the movie. I wasnâ(TM)t big on the ending. I understand not going with the exact Wrath of Khan sacrifice and switching it around was cool. But it kind of just gets retconned immediately after and that lessens the impact. Itâ(TM)s a major issue that really holds this back from being on the level of its predecessor.\n\nOverall: Even with an ending I didnâ(TM)t love, thereâ(TM)s a ton to like about this installment. Itâ(TM)s a ton of fun, featuring great acting, and some excellent action throughout. That makes this a blast of a sci-fi movie.",

Let me just begin by saying that I liked this rendition of Khan, I thought Benedict Cumberbatch was much more imposing as Khan than Ricardo Montalban. But, you can tell that the movie dumbs down some of the aspects of The Wrath of Khan. Whereas The Wrath of Khan's effects were felt across two movies, this movie resolves all of the consequences in its' third act, which it does in quite a sloppy way. The visual effects were, once again, amazing and the cinematography is just beautiful. I had the chance to watch it in IMAX and it was an amazing experience. The score by Michael Giacchino is, again, amazing and the theme for Khan was really good. Specifically the track: \"London Calling\" is an amazing piece of music. Overall, Star Trek: Into Darkness is not as good as the first Star Trek reboot, but still one of the best of the franchise.",

Although I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie, this sequel was much more enjoyable for me, and as someone who had very little knowledge of Star Trek before these movies, \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" has got me hooked on the series. The acting is probably the one thing that stands out the most, and I have to mention the absolute best part about this movie here: Benedict Cumberbatch (John Harrison/Khan). He killed every single one of his scenes, and Star Trek went from having one of the worst villains in the first movie, to one of the best villains in the second. Every line he delivered, every action he made, was done so well, with an art of perfection that made the movie more thrilling than it would've been without him. The plot I found was also an improvement from the first movie, it had a little more depth, and while it got a little all over the place at some rare points, it still stuck with a solid premise that kept me engaged throughout. The main thing that knocked this movie off the high horse that I am putting it on, is the ending. It was extremely rushed, and you go from thinking there's about 20-25 minutes of movie left, to suddenly just the quick wrap up and ending in about 5 minutes. I felt if they took the time to just fine tune that ending a little bit, the movie would've left you with a much better impression. Nonetheless, \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" was an extremely solid second instalment to the Star Trek 2010's reboot, and is one hundred percent definitely worth the watch.",

It provides an interesting and detailed story without a complicated or convoluted narrative--sucking us right in.\n\nThe jokes are kept appropriate to the situations. They're never forced or too comic-booky. The film is fun without ever resorting to silliness, which is common among this reboot franchise. It tends to avoid the Avengers route. The quips are delivered with conviction and the banter usually comes from a place of stress, providing just the right amount of levity.\n\n2009's Star Trek mostly blind-sided us. Fanboys were shocked at how awesome it was, and non-fans were surprised at how much they loved it. This one didn't have as much to prove, but it delivered regardless, giving us 132 minutes of gripping story, compelling characters, and near-perfect pacing. I'd say it did just fine.\n\nTwizard Rating: 99",

If you take away all the previous movies, this is probably better than the first one, because it really does a lot more than the first one and it does go to new planets, for example Kronos which was a treat to see. The acting is great, especially from Cumberbatch who gives a great performance as the main villain. He gives a scary performance as well as a really emotional and lovable performance. One of the reasons, however, why we need to look at the other movies like canon, is because of a scene featuring Leonard Nimoy. And that's where the movie haults for me. This movie is a soft reboot of the great \"The Wrath of Khan,\" and when the movie tries to be that masterpiece, it really feels sloppy for me. I didn't like the fact that Cumberbatch turned out to be Khan and that they wanted to give the character a little twist. The fact that his blood can bring people back from the dead is the most ridiculous thing that anyone has ever done in a movie and that took me out of the movie and really had a big impact on my final thoughts. But, I still ended up liking the movie very much and, while I can't say that it's better than the first one, I can say that it is definitely a worthy follow-up and a great addition to this new franchise.",

While the ladder is a fair criticism, it doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the film.  Though I can understand a particular third act plot choice that felt like a forced homage to 1982's The Wrath of Khan, this rendition of Khan is still well realized.  \n\nMost of the credit there should go to the relentless performance from Benedict Cumberbatch.  Not as flashy nor as memorable as Ricardo Montalban's Khan, Cumberbatch is far more brutal and deceptive.  Even on repeat viewing, I found myself captivated by every scene with Khan, especially those which also involved Kirk and/or Spock.  There's something about the dialogue between them that feels vintage good vs evil while also presenting such a tremendous amount of gravitas as well.\n\nJ.J. Abrams is a genius filmmaker, but I don't think he gets enough credit for what he did with both his Trek films.  The series was nearly dead before he came aboard and revamped and refreshed the entire idea of what a Trek film is.  Even if it deviates from lore, 'Into Darkness' is a really well made film.  The effects have never been better and the way Abrams seamlessly takes us from a CGI or green screen landscape into an integral one on one dialogue battle is very impressive.\n\nThough not every key emotional moment feels earned in the third act, it's nice seeing all of the actors start to come into their own as the respected crew members of the Enterprise.  Scotty has never been better, Sulu gets more than enough time to shine, Quinto brought a new layer to Spock not seen in 2009, and Chris Pine feels much more like an heir apparent to William Shatner than he did in the first entry.  To me, it was much easier to care about the characters this time around.\n\nWith all this said, there's plenty that I wish the film did differently.  The Khan reveal and 3rd act mishandle of the infamous moment are just some of the mishaps that could have been fixed.  Or even the entire subplot with the Admirals daughter, but I digress.  'Into Darkness' is a far better film than it probably has a right to be with a fun and exciting direction from Abrams and lively performances from the good and bad side of the coin.\n\n+Cumberbatch\n\n+Abrams directing style\n\n+Great dialogue between Kirk, Khan, and Spock\n\n-3rd act mishaps\n\n8.2/10",

Self-sacrifice.  Humor.  Friendship.  Love.  Serving causes greater than one's own self-centered way of living.  And, of course, plenty of Captain Kirk fist swinging action scenes.  JJ Abrams has done what Steven Spielberg has accomplished many times over; he's caught lightning in a bottle.  This director/producer has done, in a few short years, more for modern cinema and television than most others in similar positions do in a lifetime.  Felicity.  Alias.  Lost.  Fringe.  Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  As the original Captain Kirk said to Mr. Stiles, 'leave your bigotry in your quarters... There's no room for it on the bridge' of the Starship Enterprise.  So instead of seeking to tear down such works of love and each other, we should become united as 'one big happy fleet'.  After all, our kind has proven to the narrow-minded of this world that we were right all along:  Sci-Fi and Fantasy reign supreme in the world's collective Hollywood conscience.

The movie is about federation being attacked by a mad man named Khan and in order to stop and bring him to justice the crew of the enterprise must once again band together to face their greatest foe yet. Like with the last movie dubbed \"Star Trek\" this movie is excellent. The cast is perfect and Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan is a match made in heaven. They all deliver great performances as well. The action is amazing and visually speaking the film looks fantastic. The story is great and a good re imagined version of the story from \"Wrath of Khan\". Khan as a villain is really great and a vast improvement on Nero. Khan is smart, powerful and ruthless and it shows with the Cumberbatches awesome performance. Kirk and Spock are as great as ever and have and always will have great on screen chemistry. Overall this movie is an excellent sequel and a great addition to the Star Trek series. 4.5/5",

Unfortunately, any really serious discussion of this is left by the wayside, in favour of yet another effort with superficial Trek references to shut nerds up while the movie itself does everything it can to be generic. Somehow, though, this piece is worse, as it takes the time to do a re-enactment of a pivotal scene in Wrath Of Khan near the end (minus the subtleties, strong performances, caring about the characters and most of what made that scene emotionally impactful), which is just... urgh. \n\nThese characters still aren't the original characters, though God bless Karl Urban for really trying to invest the one or two lines he gets with the \"real McCoy\" (pun intended). There's still no sign of anything but a superficial attempt at a deeper meaning (which comes down to \"war is bad, governments are shady\", without trying to find much nuance). The designs are as un-Trek as ever, despite some superficial attempts. This, on top of a disjointed story trying to be five things at once, just makes this a mess.

            "content": "Overstuffed and overly serious, Star Trek Into Darkness fails to capture the magic J.J. Abrams brought to Star Trek, his 2009 reboot of the popular sci-fi series. It's far from a horrible summer movie; On the contrary, its almost overwhelming imagination and brisk pace mean you're in store for nearly two hours of sheer breathlessness. But breathing is a good thing, and there's no time for it here. Abrams has directed a well-oiled machine, but all the digital wizardry, elaborate world-building, and witty repartee between the crew members of the Starship Enterprise can't distract from the fact that there isn't an ounce of heart in this motion picture.\n\nThe film opens mid-mission as Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and his first officer, Spock (Zachary Quinto), are attempting to quietly defuse a potentially volcanic situation on a distant, uncivilized planet. Nothing goes according to plan, however, and while everyone survives the ordeal, Kirk is relieved of his post, and Spock is transferred.\n\nIt's Kirk's mentor, Admiral Pike (Bruce Greenwood), who assumes the command of the Enterprise, and he and Kirk join every other Starfleet commander at an emergency meeting in San Francisco to discuss the bombing of an archives building in London. John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch), a former covert agent for the organization, is the culprit, but this first attack is just the beginning of his plan. He opens fire on this meeting, kills a number of men, escapes to the Klingon home planet of Kronos (where Starfleet is forbidden to go), and infuriates a real hot head in Kirk.\n\nStar Trek Into Darkness' problems start right away. On this gorgeous red planet, stone-colored cavemen fire arrow after arrow at a fleeing Kirk and Bones (Karl Urban, who steals every scene he's in). They survive. Spock dangles out of a spaceship over bubbling lava before his life line is cut and he falls. He survives. If it weren't for a well-placed cliff (Kirk and Bones' escape) and a magnificently sturdy rock (Spock's salvation), there wouldn't be a Star Trek Into Darkness.\n\nOf course, we've gotten used to creaky plot machinations like these in blockbuster movies over the years, but Abrams stretches this frustrating trend beyond acceptability. Everything that happens in Star Trek Into Darkness is the product of its screenplay. It's as if these great characters have no agency, yet one of the film's biggest themes is that of leadership and the importance in trusting one's gut. Sadly, screenwriters Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof never give Kirk and company a chance to do that. Abrams choreographs everything to death and ratchets the pace up to an 11, hoping his giddy audience won't notice the film's soullessness.\n\nIf there's one thing the film does right, it's introduce us to Benedict Cumberbatch's John Harrison. The man's performance is quite good, but the character is a fascinating one. He's involved in a pretty huge third-act swerve, and from there, it takes a long time to nail down his intentions and true allegiance. There are hero/anti-hero/villain dynamics at play in this film that will truly surprise you and, if you're lucky, guide you through some of the screenplay's clunkier moments.\n\nAbrams' biggest asset, as with his 2009 original, is its stellar cast. Chris Pine's work as Kirk is assured, even if it doesn't feel as fresh as it did in the previous film. Ditto Zachary Quinto. It's Simon Pegg (whose Scotty has much more to do than he did last time) and the aforementioned Karl Urban who steal the show. Their comic timing is simply spot-on.\n\nThe film looks gorgeous, even if the cities of the future are a little nondescript. Abrams' visual style is very much identifiable and very much appropriate for the setting. And ultimately, the film is fun, but some of its story beats fall incredibly flat. Anyone who's seen a movie like this know these characters are untouchable, and as such, there's next to no tension in Star Trek Into Darkness. It's a far cry from the last time Abrams visited this world, and while there are more than a few enjoyable elements, you can't help but leave this film a little let down.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/star-trek-into-darkness-review/",

While I certainly understand the filmmakers desire to emote some of that film's tone in this new adventure, I really wish they hadn't copied scene for scene in some cases. You can't copy a classic like 'Wrath of Khan,' but when you do, you damn well better be able to live up to its legacy. I think one of my biggest problems with this \"remake\" is that J.J. Abrams decided to cast the great Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan. I have nothing against Cumberbatch---he's an amazing actor! But he's also British, not Indian (meaning he's not from India)! In addition, I hated the fact that Abrams tried to \"re-do\" the classic \"You have been and always shall be my friend\" scene from 'Wrath of Khan' by switching the two iconic roles and showing Spock watching the Captain die---only to have him be revived just a few scenes later by injecting him with some of Khan's enhanced blood.

            "content": "Star Trek is a series that has always lovingly embraced its own history, which is the thing that has kept it going for nearly half a century.  This is unique in science fiction films because unlike most series in this genre, Star Trek at least has a history - or at least one worth remembering.  In the case of the new movie \"Star Trek Into Darkness,\" this is both a blessing and a curse.  Here is a prequel that plays around with our knowledge of characters and events that we know will occur later.  At times the movie brushes lightly against these references, and other times hammers them home with a railroad spike.It is up to you to decide whether you think that director J.J. Abrams has used these references as an  homage or a crutch, but what can't be denied that that he has made a rousing adventure, one that is steeped in Star Trek lore, but still tells a good story on its own.  That's because of his loving respect for the characters.  Kirk, Spock, Bones, Uhura, Sulu, Scotty and Chekov are people that we know like family.  The joy of the prequels is watching them develop into their relationships.\n\nThe plot of \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" involves a madman seemingly bent on cutting off the head of The Federation.  He is John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch speaking thorough an effectively creepy baritone), a terrorist who has committed violent acts in both England and The United States.  A Federation Ambassador Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller) gives Kirk (Chris Pine) a free-hand to go after Harrison and eliminate him - not capture.  What comes of this plot is much more than the trailer reveals and much more than can be revealed here.  One of the joys of this story is watching it unfold piece by piece.  For once, this is not an action film whose ending can be telegraphed from the first scene.  More on the plot cannot be said, suffice to say that it becomes a dangerous situation that tests Kirk's ability to command.  Yes, he can reprogram a simulator, but how does he react when his enemy destroys half of his ship?\n\nThe unpredictability of this screenplay comes for what Abrams has done to the Star Trek history.  By repositioning the series' timeline, as he did in 2009's \"Star Trek,\" he created a screenwriting masterstroke, altering the timeline while still respecting the history.  Despite the fact that this is a prequel, we don't have complete foreknowledge of how things are going to play out.  That creates a new dynamic in the characters.  In the previous film, we saw how Jim Kirk got into the captain's chair.  This time he is put to the test and has to prove that he belongs there.  Spock (Zachary Quinto), via the altered timeline, is shown as a being of repressed emotional state, but one that has been severely tested.  His homeworld has been destroyed and his people nearly wiped out.  He's a holocaust survivor and that pushes his repressed emotions to their absolute limit.\n\nIt should not be inferred that this is a subtle, thought-provoking movie.  \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" is, for the most part, a clang-and-bang special effects picture that develops a crises about every 20 seconds, as if the filmmakers are afraid that too many quiet moments would send the audience to the box office to get their money back.  The references to Star Trek lore range from Tribbles, to Harry Mudd, to a reference to a previous Star Trek movie that has you rolling your eyes.  Yet, you're never bored by this material.  It looks, great, it moves great, it has a good story to tell.  It loves its history for better and worse.  What comes of this story is that the learning curve of the characters, which has been developing for two movies now, is settled in.  We're ready for a new adventure, hopefully one that leaves the tired formula of the madman behind and gets the crew on its feet to take the series back to its original purpose, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations.  Boldly go.",

I was somewhat focused on the hi-tech capabilities of the starship more than the evil plot of the story. Kirk and Spock are typically more active compared to the rest of the crew, even though Sulu appears to be less important, almost secretive as the enemy is so preoccupied with Kirk and Spock, and yet every known crew member plays and important role in survival cooperation.",

It was engaging, but the story felt recycled. The performances was solid, but excepting one, none of them really stand out(although it was a pleasure to see Zachary Quinto again). Visually, it was unremarkable and to make matters worse, as far as this aspect is concerned, J. J. Abrams has an irritating fixation with flares. Really, there is nothing spectacular about those flairs. They're nice, every once in a while, but Abrams abuses of that and they become extremely annoying.

I also thought Abrams did a good job continuing the development of the characters from the first film, making these movies really feel like they connect well. The only negatives with the film, in my opinion, stem from them not branching away from the original series. I didn't love that in the first film but I thought the \"alternate universe\" concept was an interesting way to stay true to the franchise source material while still allowing the writers a certain level of artistic freedom. That is no longer the case and Abrams' insistent on staying attached at the hip to the original was a weak point for me. While it felt like an interesting concept in the first film, it felt like lazy writing in this one. I really do hope they continue to build this story with more films because I love the universe and the cast but hopefully in future endeavors they leave Leonard Nimoy off of the cast list.",

Likewise, the returning cast members are great, though the Kirk/Spock friendship feels a bit forced.\n\nThe biggest problem with \"Star Trek: Into Darkness\" is the plot.  The plot takes a long time to get off the ground, and even then the narrative is unfocused.  Part of this is because the movie can't decide who it wants the villain to be.\n\nOf course I know who I want the villain to be.  The addition of Benedict Cumberbatch to the cast as John Harrison (aka *Spoiler*) is perfect.  Cumberbatch makes for an excellent villain, and a big part of that is his sinister, penetrating stare and terrifying voice.\n\nDespite its weak story, \"Star Trek: Into Darkness\" is a great film, sustained by dazzling effects and an outstanding performance by Cumberbatch.  Simply put, \"Into Darkness\" is just as fun as the first film, but not as good.",

Star Trek Into Darkness not only surpasses the first film but it takes you on journey throughout space (but not time this time) of epic proportions. It is a shame that director J.J. Abrams will not be returning to direct a third film as he will be moving on to Star Wars, but I still am on board all the way for now. It deals with James Kirk's (Pine) decisions to lead his crew into the darkness despite his peers' (Saldana & Quinto) attempts to stop him from going after a mysterious entity (Cumberbatch) who has committed an unforgivable crime.

Chris Pine as Kirk was definitely good, but Quinto lost a little something for me this time.  And, while this may be a parallel Star Trek universe, the comparison's, albeit flipped a little, to the original Wrath of Khan, were just...weak. I rolled my eyes more than a few times.  Visually, the film was beautiful, but the story was elementary, the dialogue was too full of unnecessary banter and bickering and the fight scenes were entirely over-choreographed.  I now hesitate to see what JJ does with the Star Wars franchise, when I was ready to hand it all over to him.  I guess he can't hurt what George was doing, but Star Trek Into Darkness seemed thrown together and, since the end takes them to the beginning of their 5-year mission to explore strange, new worlds, it doesn't seem like there will be a sequel.",

And thus JJ Abrams and team came back to write the sequel: Star Trek: Into Darkness. And while it did earn much money and critical praise, fans were kind of on the edge on the film. Some hardcore fans hating how the franchise is still yet not being treated properly, and a huge criticism point on the film's writers (who i hate IN EVERY SINGLE WAY) Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci & Damon Lindelof almost creating a carbon copy of Wrath of Khan and paying a bit TOO much homage to the series. And look i'll be honest, when I saw this film back on it's premiere day i found it still enjoyable and pretty entertaining. And after letting the film sit for the upcoming Star Trek: Beyond, is it still as good as i saw it way back when? ...Well, not exactly. While by no means a terrible film or insulting jab to the original SERIES, i-well-don't exactly enjoy either. It's just good. And that's primarily because the positives such as: The cast still doing a terrific job and injecting energy into their performances, well made special effects (alright that's something that no duh all of the series will have), great direction & cinematography, some witty and relieved tension that works, and still a well imagined score and newly made theme to accompany this rebooted series. However, there are negatives that i gotta say...hold the film down. Primarily: A weak and laughable story & script that i'm not surprised sucked because of (in my humble opinion) it's hack writers, it's homage that really bogs the film down, sometimes reused plot elements from the first film for ABSOLUTELY no reason, wasting good material with Khan and it's actor as a second installment than rather ending it, and overall just felt run-of-the-mill the whole way through because it tried being Wrath of Khan 2.0. So overall, it's still a good film but....not by any means a sequel that impressive enough on it's own or to continue this franchise. Hopefully, Justin Lin & Writer Simon Pegg can make the proper re-introduction and learn to balance out homage with also continuing the franchise.",

With tons of rumors and a huge hype, the sequel, \"Star Trek into Darkness\", finally arrived four years later. Did \"Star Trek into Darkness\" lived up to the hype and made the long wait worth it? \nOne year after the events of the last film, the Enterprise crew faces a new treat: A man named John Harrison. Harrison is responsible for a \"terrorist attack\" in London and attacking some Starfleet officers; Admiral Alexander Marcus tasks the Enterprise to catch this man before a war with the Klingons starts. \nBefore starting the review I want to remind you that I am not a Trekkie, so if you are one and/or want the perspective of another Trekkie, go read another review because I can't help you with that.\nFollowing a successful first installment is a very tricky goal to accomplish and \"Star Trek into Darkness\" proves it, it is a half success. On the bright side, \"Into Darkness\" counts with better acting with the highlight being, Sherlock himself, Benedict Cumberbatch; it counts with a better villain, a calmer pacing, the visually stunning experience improves, the perfect comedic timing remains and most importantly, the excitement and entertainment value of its predecessor remain. However, it counts with bigger problems: The story conceptually is great but the execution is weak, the plot also takes lots of elements from certain \"Star Trek\" film but done poorly, subplots are established but they never pay off, weaker character development, heavy-handed themes, unnecessary characters, predictable revelations and a stretched third act that has some angering and unsatisfying moments. \n\"Star Trek into Darkness\" is basically a remake under the disguise of a \"new sequel to the franchise reboot\", but this doesn't mean it's horrible. It still is a fun and enjoyable film for a summer blockbuster but is nowhere as good as the last film.",

            "content": "I have never been into Star Trek. I don't think its bad, but I just have never seen the hype around it. My stance was reaffirmed with the soulless and lackluster Abrams Star Trek reboot a few years ago. As much as I didn't care for its dead-behind-the-eyes tone, it had enough going for it that I wanted to see the follow up. I am very glad I did, because this was a dramatic leap forward, and probably Abrams best effort to date.\n\nOn a side note, J.J Abrams is a tough one for me to figure out. Almost every project he is involved is one I'm interested in. 'Cloverfield', 'Super 8', 'Star Trek', 'Lost', 'Fringe', etc. They all have super cool sounding plots and great effects and ideas. However every time I watch an Abrams production, I leave thinking 'That was ok, but it should have been so much better.' With this film, Abrams has finally satisfied his projects potential.\n\nWith the origin story out of the way, this film can just jump right in and it wastes little time in establishing itself. The plot is slick, twisty, intelligent and fast moving unlike the plodding and unwieldy story of the first film. The effects are fantastic, and all the actors seem to grow into their roles a bit more, particularly Pine who seemed quite out of place during his first foray into the final frontier. Cho and Yelchin also come around quite a bit. The notable exception here is Urban, who just can't figure out what he's doing. \n\nWhile the acting is strong and the story is good, there is really one reason this movie is as good as it is, and that is Benedict Cumberbatch as the infamous Khan. He is fantastic, creating an intense and ruthless villain whos menace permeates the entire film. He strikes me as a cross between the Joker and Hannibal Lector; a well spoken gentleman who happens to be an unstoppable bad ass with a big time problem with establishment and a fondness for hand to hand brutality. Cumberbatch is also able to convey Khans sympathetic angles, making him a multifaceted character with a lot going on.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the film is in great shape. Unconventional shots and great cinematography take full advantage of its great sets and effects. The score is very good as it really amps up the tension without being distracting. As I said, I don't know a ton about Star Trek so I'm not entirely sure how it compares as far as continuity with the originals, but I did recognize plenty of references and Easter-eggs pertaining to its predecessor. A really well handled piece of film making.\n\nThere are some drawbacks of course. It does get a bit convoluted at times particularly during the third act. A few plot holes and head scratching moments jump the rails a bit, but it does manage to find itself again. I didn't care for the whole 'emoting Spock/BFF Kirk' angle, as it came across as out of character and over the top. None of these problems are debilitating, but they are noticeable.\n\nOverall, I have to give credit where credit is due. Abrams has done a great job here. Even as a non Star Trek fan, he had me hooked. Good story telling, good acting, a fantastic villain and beautiful composition combine to make this a surprisingly intelligent summer blockbuster more than worthy of its reputation.",

            "content": "I can see why fans of the original films and television series are not too excited about these two films, directed by J.J. Abrams.  There is barely any time to catch your breath watching these film, forget about pondering the mysteries of deep space and moral dilemas of previous movies.  However, if you are looking for a rip-roaring action movie that just happens to have the veneer of Star Trek slapped on this is for you.  \nTo call this movie fast paced is like saying the Evil Dead remake was \"kinda gory.\"  This movie doesn't slow down for a minute.  Which is awesome but also kind of a detriment when you are trying to figure out if the movie's logic makes sence or not.  (Why did you hide your friends in missles again?)  But for the most part you will be taken along for a breathless ride.  \n\nDespite the large cast, all of the major players get their own moments to shine, whether through actions or one-liners.  Zachary Quinto is once again excellent as the ever logical Spock, and Chris Pine is his equal as the cocky but passionate James T. Kirk.  That passion is what keeps him from being another rebel without a cause leading man, because his passion is for his crew.  You believe he would do anything for them.  Zoe Saldana makes more of an impression in this movie than she did in the first, standing up to Spock's detatchment in terms of their relationship.\n\nOf course everyone knows by now that Benedict Cumberbatch plays Kahn, the great twist here being he has real motivation for his villany.  He actually does come across as sympathetic in one key scene of the film.  That doesn't mean he has not chance to chew any scenery.  Of course he does: with a voice like that, it would be hard not to.  \n\nAnother bonus, Robocop himself as a villian in the film!  That's right, Peter Weller is a key figure in the movie as a Starfleet Admiral with a hidden adjenda.  Great to see him in something with such a jucy role.  Score: 8.5",

The actors were great!  Too bad the script was so idiotic.  Out of a whole universe of Star Trek to draw from Paramount had to do a really bad remake of Wrath of Khan?  You just reset the whole universe and you came up with this crap? Ugh...  So disappointed.  Such a waste of such great talent.\n\nI would also like to point out that the music is great and wasted on such a lousy script.",

            "content": "Well this one is about as easy as it gets. Should you see Star Trek Into Darkness? Yes! The end.\n\nOkay fine, I'll go into a little more detail than that... or as Scotty would say, a \"wee bit\" more detail...\n\nStar Trek Into Darkness is the 12th Star Trek movie, but it's really just the second Star Trek movie in the new canon. Star Trek in 2009 rebooted the franchise, and this is the sequel to that movie. Star Trek (2009) was a great movie and a huge success. In Star Trek Into Darkness, all of the major players are back, and it is just as good as the reboot. Might even be a bit better.\n\nThe story is set shortly after the events of the reboot. A rogue Starfleet Officer, John Harrison, has become a terrorist and takes aim at Starfleet. Captain Kirk (I assume you've heard of him) doesn't like this very much and he leads a manhunt against John Harrison. That's the main premise of the movie and I know it sounds pretty simple. And it is pretty simple, but not in a bad way. As with Star Trek (2009), this movie is more about the characters than the plot.\n\nWhat is different this time around is that the Trekkies seem to be royally pissed off about this movie being a character-driven story. It seems like most Trekkers were okay with the reboot being one, but expected something different this time around. Not sure why they expected that, but I'm also not sure why in high school they chose being a Trekkie over having sex. Needless to say I don't understand these people. Then again, I don't even know if it's 'Trekkie' or 'Trekker.' Did you know there are actually websites out there debating this topic? Apparently Leonard Nimoy (the original Spock) said the correct term was 'Trekker' and Gene Roddenberry (the creator of Star Trek) said the correct term was 'Trekkie.' Can you believe I actually looked that up before writing this?\n\nIn all seriousness I can understand why a devout Trekker wouldn't be the biggest fan of this movie. To them, Star Trek is sacrosanct (AKA don't fuck with it). And J.J. Abrams has definitely fucked with it and it's not as 'Star Trek-ish' as previous materials. With that said, this is still a great movie. The cast is top-notch. The production value is off-the-charts good. The cinematography and special effects are terrific. The story is face-paced but easy to follow. The movie is over 2 hours long but feels shorter than that. Prior to the reboot in 2009, Star Trek was very much science fiction. Star Trek Into Darkness is much less sci fi and instead it's basically just an action movie that takes place in the future and mostly in space.\n\nShould you see this movie? Absolutely. If you are a Trekker, you're going to see this regardless of what I say here, so I'll just move on. Most people do not consider themselves to be a Trekkie. And that's fine - see this movie anyway. Everyone should give this movie a try. It's very well made and has very wide appeal. And it's one of the best movies of 2013.\n\nhttp://critiquem.com/",

Abrams, and it stars the original cast from the first movie, with Benedict Cumberbatch as the main villain in a science fiction action film about Kirk's crew going after a villain who destroyed a city, and when they went after him, he has a bigger ship that can potentially take Kirk's crew down. I remember that watching the sequel for the first time, I actually thought it was better than the first one, but one of the reasons was because I was one of the people that really like seeing action, and seeing that it has more action in it, made me enjoyed it even more. Watching it again, I can say that there were some parts that were better, but overall, almost as fantastic as the first one. The acting is still fantastic, and with Benedict Cumberbatch, he brought a new level of intimidation to this that he's automatically better in terms of acting and character than the first movie with Eric Bana. The special effects look dazzling as usual, and the fight scenes are a lot of fun to watch. The score Michael Giacchino is really good and emotional that it's a little better than his previous score in the first movie. The writing by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof is really good, and the fan service is more in this, but it still managed to be its own thing, that is until the final act of the film where it'll start to remind me a lot of Wrath of Kahn, and not only that, the final 10 minutes of it were really not needed. The plot is a bit more simple than the first film, but it still kept me interested, and the character progression is there, which is good. Star Trek Into Darkness is a really great sequel that while not quite as tight or refined as the first reboot film, it still brought the high points from the first one to this one, and was very entertaining to watch.",

And her role is a sign of the sexism inherent throughout this movie.  Carol Marcus is only here to provide a bit of skin and a convenient plot point latter so her father stops firing on the Enterprise.  The fact that Spock allows her to remain on the ship after her deception has been uncovered never makes sense either.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, there are too many problems to list them all, but here are a few: Starships are designed for the vacuum in space, not the pressures of the ocean.  Lose of gravity does not make you slide it makes you float.  And my final gripe is that the ship travels to and from Klingon space in the blink of an eye.  It's warp drive not hyperdrive.  Oh, and with their awesome new superblood no one will ever die.  Yey! (Sarcasm).\n\nBottom line this movie is a joke.  It relies on the heart and emotion of Wraith of Khan to make the inconsistencies and plot holes seem tolerable.  Even Benedict Cumberbatch couldn't make the revelation he was Khan (a watered down and whitewashed version at best) work because no one had a reason to know who or what that meant.  One thing I will say they got right was the title; Into Darkness.  Because that is the direction this film is taking the once great franchise.",

This is proof that a blockbuster action movie can also be quite smart. I'm sure more devoted Trek fans would have liked a more convoluted plot, like the TNG films, but I appreciated the balance this film gives for the Trek faithful and non.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch continues his string of geek pleasing dream roles. Can he do no wrong?\n\nZachary Quinto once again plays Spock, and alarmingly well. It's almost as if he were born for the role.\n\nBut look at me, fan-boying out. What else do I expect from J.J. Abrams? He gave me LOST, now he gives me incredible sci-fi. \n\nWe'll just forget about \"Felicity\"...\n\n.... KHHAANNN!!!",

Many people see the old Star Trek as \"nerdy\" but this new interpretation makes the characters gritty and deep.  J.J. Abrams has used a combination of incredible special effects, witty dialogue, and pure action to bring Star Trek to \"the next generation\" (couldn't resist the pun).  This story picks up where the first one left off, developing the relationship between Kirk and Spock and again throwing Kirk into the center of controversy.  With the character origins established in the first installment, this film gets right into the action and allows for the introduction of Khan.  He is one of the most intriguing characters in the franchise and Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect actor to deliver this sophisticated dialogue.   The plot twists back and forth, keeping you on your heels and trying to figure out if Khan is helpful or dangerous.  The greatest part of the film is the heroism and sacrifice displayed at the end.  It really gets to the heart of science fiction and superhero movies of days past.  Whoever dreamed up this script should be commended for successfully bringing Khan back to life (pun intended), building chemistry between Spock and Kirk, echoing the themes set forth in the opening of the film, resolving the seemingly impossible plot twist, and setting up the next film with the \"Space: the final frontier\" speech.  This greatly exceeds the expectations of most action movies.  All of the acting is spot on and I love how they found a way to feature Simon Pegg as Scotty, even though he wasn't critical to the themes being developed throughout the film.  Space has come to life with \"Star Trek: Into Darkness.\"  Not only am I anxious for the next installment, but I may even have to go back and watch the original films.",

Against all odds, Kirk and his crew do a mission only they can do ? Kirk space-freefalls to an obstacle ? Enterprise gets seemingly shot-down but TRIUMPHANTLY RISES INTO FRAME at the last second ???-- Just way too many similarities with the first movie. Cumberbatch as KAHN is cool, but he's WAY shoehorned into this movie, that seems more like a TRIBUTE to the success of the first film. His story is also pretty terrible and not well implemented.

            "content": "Sort of a long-winded predecessor to the 2009 reboot. I can't decide if Into Darkness is objectively worse than Star Trek, but I definitely responded more favorably to Star Trek. Perhaps because going into Star Trek I had zero expectations, thus ended up fairly pleasantly surprised. Here I was expecting a lot more and ended up kind of let down. It's a fine sort of movie, but it has a number of warts that I'm having trouble getting past.\n\n1. Karl Urban. His attempt at acting here is befuddling for how much it is like watching someone parody the character on YouTube. Heck, an untalented, never-before-acted parody would probably deliver more subtlety and texture to the character than Urban provides. I had to do that combination cringe-lol every time he was on screen.\n\n2. The convoluted plot is too hard to follow. In a movie like this where there is a strong villain, we don't need a deep intricate plot. Deep plots are fine... as long as they can be followed amid all the chaos. However, best to lose some of that complexity in cases like this where the plot points are likely to get lost amid explosions and lens flares. It's not so much about WHAT is going on on-screen, but trying to figure out the reasons WHY that becomes problematic.\n\n3. Trying to give Spock too much emotion. Ok, perhaps the original series went a bit too far in de-emotionizing Spock. Then again, a part of the draw of the character were the few slight times that he allowed his human side to show. Here he's practically a bundle of emotions. This is a case where perhaps Into Darkness succeeds at factually portraying a 50% Vulcan, 50% human combo, but it results in a character that is a far cry from what makes the original Spock so endearing.\n\n4. Speaking of Spock, the Leonard Nemoy cameo feels horrifically shoehorned in and unnecessary. What we need at the end of movie 2 in this reboot series is for young Spock to take things by the reins and prove that He Is Spock. Calling up Old Spock for a spot of instruction hardly inspires confidence.\n\nSo Into Darkness still manages to be fun, but it's in that grey area of being kind of a bad movie all at the same time. Hard to hate, hard to love.",

Almost tripling the action and set piece from the series reboot in 2009, JJ Abrams boldly attempts to get our pulse racing from the very beginning with a gorgeous and heart racing opening. The character art and location is visually unique and stunning, using CGI to push the vibrancy of a doomed planet and its occupants. This will continue throughout the film, however a mixed bag of irritating lens flare and trying to keep this too family a film, almost does it a disservice. The story begins as Kirk, played amazingly by Pine, and his team are forced to save Spock, yet again amazingly played by Quinto, as he decides to save a species from extinction. This is obviously against protocol and upon completion of the mission and successful return to earth, Kirk is pulled from his captaincy of the USS Enterprise for recklessness and lack of rule following. Felt betrayed by Spock, Kirk goes off the radar and all the while, John Williamson, Yet again a extraordinary performance from Benedict Cumberbatch, uses the will of a dying daughters father to commit sabbotage against an archive facility in London. Thus leading to all the leading members of the star fleet to meet in the one location. This predictably is where John wants them and after slaughtering Pike and other heads of the enterprise, John hides out on a Klingon planet as refuge and Kirk and his team are ordered to head to this \"Uninhabited\" planet in order to nuke John from orbit. It is all naturally a bit fishy and before you know it all hell has broken loose and of course, John isnt quite who we thought he was and offers Kirk and his crew quite possibly the worst threat they could encounter... Sorry the film would let you believe it is going to do that, however the outcome is one thats bark is much worse than its bite. Firstly the cast is just jaw dropping, talent from Urban, Pegg, Pine, Quinto, Salander, Cumberbatch and Yelchin are all top notch. Playing the characters expertly, paying homage from whence they came, however not parodying it. Its a tough call but JJ ensures its execution perfectly. In fact you genuinly love every character you encounter, apart from Benedict but thats because hes doing his job properly. The CGI is extremely impressive for its time and for the most part does an excellent job of not becoming to irritating... Apart from that trademark JJ lens flare, it pains me to say it but its close to crippling at points, there is no need for that effect every 3 shots. It brings you completely out of the experience and from what i could tell, only hightens one if not maybe two effects on the grand scheme of things. Luckily the DOP does some stunning and imaginitive work in order to keep our eyes invested beyond the CGI and the mix of sets and green screen is a welcome one, after such films which shall not be names decide to use entirely green screen. Michael Giacchinos score is pounding and accompanies these visuals wonderfully, never is there a dull moment in this film and the music only services to ensure this is the case. Now where the films biggest flaws lay and no its not the lens flare, come from its predictability and its lack of \"Cahoanies\" without giving too much away, Cumberbatch plays a massive villainous role within this film, and to be honest from the get go, we can see the twist coming. Much like we can  see the outcome of many things coming in this film. the script and director feel the need to spell things out every 15 minutes or so, just incase you as a viewer decide that over the length of two hours is too much to hold your attention for... The amount of times i was narrating in my head what was going to happen next was unbearable and even in some cases, quoting lines i hadnt heard yet. This is not good, had this been any less of a film it would be a catastrophy, luckily it has its eye set on spectical and character that its gaping obviousness is allowed through. It's second fault is that Into Darkness, clearly highlighted by its title, wants to get get gritty and dark and visceral. Good, so why then do i feel like im watching a tamed down version? Why doesnt the director or the writers actually put us in a position where there is no going back? Why does the \"Wrath\" of a certain character, actually just end up as a bunch of CGI destruction and a small \"tear jerking\" moment that enduces no tears because for the past few hours it has spelt out the ending for you? I know that not all films need to be pitch black to be perfect, however it feels here that JJ wanted something a lot darker than he submits for our viewing pleasure. Thus making it fall short of \"Dark Knight\" stature. All that aside though, as a action block buster, it is without a doubt bombastic and a film where you actually give a rats ass about the characters. Enjoyable, fun and fast paced, let down only by not doing as it promised, taking us truely \"Into\" the \"Darkness\"",

This is, quite simply put, A HUGE CONTINUITY PROBLEM. Not only that, but one of the best (and most saddening) moments in all of science-fiction was when Spock sacrificed his life for the crew of the Enterprise at the end of The Wrath of Khan. Now, the lines \"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.\" and \"I have been -and always shall be- your friend.\" have been desecrated. Even though this doesn't introduce a continuity problem like the change of Khan's ethnicity, this just destroys everything that was meaningful in the ending events of The Wrath of Khan. Not only that, but it leaves out the Genesis Project all together, which basically does away with all the events of The Search For Spock and The Voyage Home. I'm done with JJ Abrams, and quite frankly I think it was a mistake to hire him as director for the upcoming Star Wars film. Mark my words, he will destroy yet another series!",

            "content": "Abrams is back with a sequel/prequel to his snazzy, new Star Trek vision. The focus is supposed to be upon making the characters as much like the originals as possible, and I am very fond of the casting choices. Zachary Quinto was born to play the part of Spock, and Chris Pine is a very fine Kirk. Who could not approve of Simon Pegg in the role of Scotty? The comic relief he provides is perfectly timed and essential to the film's flow. I loved seeing Cumberbatch at his villain-esque best as well. The only acting choice I did not agree with was John Cho as Sulu. He's just completely wrong for the part.\n\nI enjoyed the film just as much as I did the first Abrams installment. There is plenty of action for those who crave explosions, but the characters remain the nuts and bolts of the story. It's still difficult for me to get my head around the whole Spock and Uhura thing. I was raised on the old tv programs, and I remember how Spock could never really commit himself to a relationship. I understand that Abrams' ideal for Spock is someone who can be both innately logical as well as loving, but it deviates a bit too much for me, and I found it a bit distracting. Perhaps an unrequited affection on Uhura's part would have suited me better.\n\nAll in all, I believe that most Trekkies would be pleased with the outcome; and even those of us who just walk the fringe of that circle can come away satisfyingly entertained. Abrams is undoubtedly pleased by its success.",

I've got a few favourites this year: Gangster Squad, Oblivion and Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters, and now Into Darkness is in my top favourites. I've never felt so immersed and involved in a sci-fi movie this much since last year's Total Recall, every location in space and on futuristic Earth looks real and each part of the Enterprise is convincing. The beautiful 3D gets you in on the action even more as every object shoots out at you with ferocity, the depth effects are astounding as locations disappear into the background and flakes of dust and sparks hover off the screen, this is the most active and alive 3D of the year! Chris Pine's performance is brilliant as Kirk, I once thought he was a typical actor who only did silly rom coms but damn he's good, he proves he can act in a diverse range of movies. Kirk still disobeys the rules and his ignorance costs him dearly, this is true character development, same goes to the rest of the cast who are equally gripping to watch, and best of all it's great to see every cast member get it on the action, and Saldana is back and better than before. Benedict Cumberbatch is fierce and merciless, his deep bass filled voice echoes sending chills down your spine as he utters every piece of dialogue, \"I will walk over your cold corpses, and then I will recover my crew. . .Now, shall we begin?\" I love the story, which constantly unfolds across different planets and then ends up with one of the best action packed finales since Transformers Dark of The Moon, where the Vengeance obliterates downtown San Francisco, then Khan and Spock battle it out on a hover-jet, the special effects here are utterly jaw dropping. I find this sequel far more entertaining than the first movie, don't get me wrong the first is truly amazing, but Into Darkness lives up to it's sinister title delivering moments of shocking tension and brutality alongside blistering action in stunning 3D.",

The characters actually seem like they could be the younger versions of the people in the original series. I don't know if there is actually a standout character as they all portray their parts extremely well.  It is always a nice added touch to see the original Spock Leonard Nimoy make and appearance as well. All that being said, you certainly don't have to be a trekky to enjoy this movie, but rather just a fan of sci-fi or action movies. The movie flows along great and it chalked full of action.

However, Mr. Cumberpatch is quite interesting to watch: the tighter he smushes his face, the more his eyes leak, as if his head was being juiced whenever he speaks about \"his crew,\" then goes back to resuming his boring monotone that he is most celebrated for. His jaw-opening ability is showcased with every vowel he utters, proving that he could literally swallow an entire jelly donut whole. It is, without argument, the most unique and interesting aspect of the film. Though Abrams' inability to convey any rational thought or emotion of his characters , his no-talent is further reflected by his inability to comprehend the blatant logical fallacies within the script. A great film for the \"average\" moviegoer with an \"average\" 100 IQ, though I've seen better looking film on teeth.",

And as that happened, everything was ridiculously predictable and cliched.

That's right, he planned to save his friends by inserting them into DEADLY WEAPONS.\n\n-Kirk is given 72 torpedoes to kill ONE MAN. One man on a planet's surface, no less. Khan wasn't even in a starship. He's ordered to fire them all. Sure, we find out that these torpedoes have supermen in them, and that admiral Marcus wants them dead, but Kirk doesn't even QUESTION the order.\n\n-Why was the Enterprise underwater at the film's start, and how did it get there initially without being seen by the planet's natives?\n\n-Kirk, again and again, displays a disregard for authority and an affinity for bad decisions. Furthermore, he NEVER EVEN GRADUATED FROM STARFLEET ACADEMY! Why does he get to command the Federation's flagship?\n\n-Khan beamed from Earth to Kronos. If such transporter technology exists, why bother with starships at all?\n\n-An injection of Khan's blood will CURE DEATH. Essentially, humanity no longer needs doctors. How are we going to fear for our favorite characters' lives in the next movie? Also, Kirk was dead for all of 15 minutes. His death had almost no emotional impact.\n\n-Where were the rest of Earth's forces during the final confrontation in Earth's atmosphere? Nobody even thought to HAIL the ships and see what was up? Did nobody in Starfleet notice the big space battle?\n\nAnd I've only scratched the surface here.\n\nIt wasn't the action. It wasn't the acting. It wasn't the references to previous films. It certainly wasn't a reaction against the film's popularity. It was the plot holes. The film was riddled with them. I walked out of the theater thoroughly unsatisfied. I'm surprised that so many people reacted so positively to this film, and am glad to see that at least the diehard fans have some sense, even if the rest of the moviegoing public was content to swallow such a flimsy plot.",

Spock is a by the book regulations following noble intelligent good guy.  Kirk relies on wits and charisma, he flies by the seat of his pants and has an extra ration of luck on his side, but he feels that one can bend the rules to do what is morally right.  This sets up tension that lasts throughout the film.  A villain John Harrison attacks Starfleet and the crew of the Enterprise are sent on a mission to kill him.  That is the basic plot.  But we find circumstances arrive that put into question who to trust.  The Darkness the title suggests is some ambiguous moral darkness.

And yes, Benedict Cumberbatch IS everywhere (this time as the villain, Khan - yes, THAT Khan).  What is really lacking here is a plot - what little story offered to us is only wafer thin.  The human relationships are schematic, held together by scenes of predictable emotion (or lack of emotion, when it comes to Spock).  But the two hours passed easily and I didn't feel too guilty for squandering them.

The plot makes zero sense, character motivations are imperceptible, and Kirk simply repeats the same character arc he had in the first film, leaving the entire affair to cruise purely on pretty visuals and cast chemistry. Granted, this was the main draw of the first film too, but things felt far more balanced the first go around (Uhura's role is now \"nagging girlfriend;\" Sulu, Bones, and Chekhov barely register; and Alice Eve's Carol appears for nothing more than a few moments of blatant objectification). Qunto and Pegg are maybe the only two cast members to come through unscathed, while Chris Pine is embarrassingly awful at times.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch's villain is entertaining in spurts, but he's also all over the map and plays a variety of functions-- part tactical genius, part tortured anti-hero, part Bourne-esque superspy, part sociopathic terrorist-- yet he never fully inhabits any of these roles, and never makes much of an impact as a result.  The decision to name him \"Khan\"-- a classic Trek villain with which he shares zero characteristics-- was downright baffling, and keeping it a secret from the public by way of the \"John Harrison\" moniker (despite no narrative consequence whatsoever) was even more bizarre. Using his character to preach 9/11 truther conspiracy stuff (and inject some supposed political relevancy by ripping off \"The Dark Knight\") come across as ham-fisted and dumb.\n\nThe lack of dramatic stakes in the final twenty minutes are utterly laughable (Bones desperately needs the blood of a genetic super-being like Khan to revive Kirk! There's like fifty of them in the room he's standing in!), but I appreciated that an FX heavy blockbuster would feature a relatively low-key foot-chase as its climactic action sequence (Sometimes bigger isn't better). It's a profoundly uneven film that occasionally stumbles upon some good moments and ideas, but it can't draw them together in a remotely satisfying way. There's less lens flare though, so that's something.",

We spent the better part of three hours in 2009 watching Kirk have some humility drilled into him only to find that some Admiral with a messiah complex has put the galaxy at risk and it turns out that cock-sure Kirk is desirable.

They are duking it out practically outside of Earth and yet there's not one starship, not one hail from Star Fleet, not one starbase... nothing.

WELL, it has arrived and it KICKED some serious ASS.\n\nStar Trek Into Darkness is what modern action filmmaking has evolved into.

I'm glad they managed to give most of the characters more personality and a moment to grow and develop. Having mentioned that, it's worth to note that Benedict Cumberbatch stole the show with his acting as the ruthless villain and I wouldn't hesitate to give him the title of villain of the year, even if it's still May. (although many people might disagree)\n\nOverall I would say this is THE movie of the summer.

            "content": "4 years after the reboot of the popular franchise directed by J.J Abrams has now returned with a sequel. Star Trek Into Darkness is definitely a much anticipated sequel due to the first film being successful commercially and critically. Hype is inevitable with films like these, which at times is a good thing but that very same thing can be the cause of the film's demise, due to the increase in expectations and ambition. This sequel have been argued whether or not this is an improvement over it's predecessor, but there is one thing I can guarantee and is that this film is definitely a well made Science Fiction Action film.\n\nStar Trek Into Darkness was written by Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof & Roberto Orci, and all three acts as screenwriters and producers of this film and it's predecessor. Kurtzman and Orci have shown their weaknesses in films like the Transformers series but both have definitely made up for those films with their contribution to the Star Trek franchise. Lindelof has collaborated with Abrams frequently, and the one out of the three writers for this film that has written some films with great stories (Prometheus & World War Z), at least in my opinion. The sequels of the franchise is usually the best opportunity for the writers to dish out the best stories for the franchise as they are not restricted in having to explain the characters back stories and having to define the relationship between characters. Star Trek Into Darkness can truly be a film of it's own. You don't need to watch the first one to fully understand this film as it doesn't rely solely on the previous film to drive the plot. The writers have definitely written something I found enjoyable with a plot that is intriguing and a villain that is so mesmerizing to watch that we wouldn't mind if the film focused on him even more. The film's screenplay is definitely thematically deeper than the first film. The film explores themes of friendship, death, sacrifice, and family. This did impress me in comparison to other blockbuster films released this year and it's something that I will definitely come back to over and over again and it would still not lose it's steam. The film also does some throwback moments to previous Star Trek films which will surprise the fans of the franchise.\n\nJ. J. Abrams comes back to direct this sequel of his successful Star Trek reboot. Abrams have definitely crafted something much better than it's predecessor as this may be due to a much better understanding and connection to the source material. Abrams have crafted something that is different from the other Star Trek films released but able to relate and throwback elements from the classics. Abrams have made something deep and entertaining. It may not be as in your face and pretentious as other films that touches the same themes as it still retains it's action packed entertainment approach which I don't mind either as long as it is executed with flourish, and Abrams has executed with such flourish. Abrams were able to sneak in some still and heartbreaking moments that surprisingly made me care about the characters, which is something I usually dismiss in films like this. This does give me more faith with Abrams future films, as he has disappointed me before like Mission Impossible 3. I hope he does return for a sequel to this film as he definitely revived a franchise to a new generation and hopefully for future ones.\n\nDaniel Mindel comes back as the director of photography for this film. Mindel is more known as an action director and he is a frequent collaborator with Abrams, aside from Super 8. Mindel and Abrams have brought back the beautiful photography that was present on the first film. The visual effects in this film do look impressive and improves the already fascinating effects from the first film. The lens flare in this film is much more toned down, or maybe it just seemed less distracting due to the improved technique in photographing this film. The shots that Abrams and Mindel uses for this film, especially within the ship, are filled with panning and this is due to the great blocking that Abrams employs in his shots allowing the film to be constantly in motion but without relying on the shaking effect of handheld camera. They also applied the same odd and disjointed angles that were abundant from the first film, but at least in here it feels less distracting. As the film does contain certain intimate moments, I felt that they were shot fantastically and adds on to the tension or emotion that Abrams wants to convey or bring out from us.\n\nMichael Giacchino is responsible for the film's score. When the film's theme song plays, it gives me the chills as it just makes me think that we are coming into a special film. Giacchino has brought the good areas from his score of the first film and improved upon that with this film feeling much more ambitious and heavy. Though the moment at the start of the film with the sick child contains a beautiful piece driven by a piano. Giacchino definitely knows how to suck us in with his scores, just listen to his work on the Pixar films like Up and Ratatouille.\n\nThe actors in this film is more focused solely on their interaction with one another rather than a separate entity of it's own like the first film, due to the first film focusing on their backstory and how that connects to the way these characters are. I can definitely say that these actors work well together and more moments show their acting range. Pine and Quinto banter and acting, particularly in scenes where their relationship and feelings towards one another are being discussed and explored, have definitely grabbed on to me; making me care about the decisions of these characters and empathise with them. A stand out performance from Benedict Cumberbatch is definitely something that needs to be noted when praising this film. Great and scene stealing villains are not something unique in films nowadays but his is something that cannot be ignored. If I am to nitpick, I am still a little disappointed with Karl Urban's character being a source of one liners, the character is also written quite campy which does become a distraction for me. All in all the actors did a great job and hopefully the next film will allow more screentime to flesh out both the actors and the characters they play.\n\nStar Trek Into Darkness is ambitious and thematically deeper than it's predecessor. It is also more entertaining and features a villain that we won't forget. I hope that Abrams come back for a third installment and somehow improve on a film that is definitely one of the best blockbuster films of 2013.",

Shatner and Nimoy left shoes that can likely never be truly filled, but JJ Abrams' first \"Star Trek\" proved that the great story of the USS Enterprise's fove-year journey could be retold appropriately and well for both an old and new audience.   My only mild critique is the puzzling reason why Benedict Cumberbatch was chosen to play the feralistic Khan, but Abrams' sleeker style to the series seems realistic enough for a futuristic universe to make up for this momentary head-scratcher. \"Into Darkness\" continues an engaing and interesting what-if story that will leave you as emotional and satisfied as the original \"Wrath of Khan\" did years ago.",

            "content": "Star Trek Into Darkness Review\n\nWhen I think of Star Trek, I think of deep space exploration, Klingon encounters, science fiction inspired character design and those awesome shades that La Forge wears in Next Generation. Well, I'm proud to announce that the latest film in this everlasting and praised franchise, Star Trek Into Darkness, has those features (okay, maybe the shades are missing). The new film by director J.J. Abrams is a well-made, action packed and visually striking piece of work as many would expect from Abrams. Into Darkness boasts energetic performances by all actors and actresses, flashy cinematography and excellent set pieces. However, where it excels in visual and performance, it lacks in overall story or long term impact.\nIn terms of plotline, Into Darkness shows that it can compel just enough for the viewer to be interested. The film's biggest strength also turned out to be its contributor to its negatives. It is shrouded with action and epic visuals which tended to throw the story in the backseat while it could boast its high budget cost to \"woo\" the audience. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of this tactic the filmmakers go with, but many will really enjoy it as it has obviously shown in its box office success. I do not want to delve too far into the plot of the film, but it does successfully pull off some twists and turns that remain entertaining enough.\nThe negative of plotline aside, the film features some excellent performances from all actors and actresses with Benedict Cumberbatch as a personal favorite, playing the role of Khan. Somehow, this man seems to command the screen every time he shows up in a scene (probably because of that epic deep voice he's got). He's a force to be reckoned with and an actor that has a successful future ahead of him; maybe even Oscar worthy. Other noteworthy performances include Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg (as always), but I only wish that Zoe Saldana had a bit more screen time. I felt that her character was also a backup idea just to assist in exploring the relationship that she and Quinto's character, Spock, shared. This film new who it wanted to focus on and it did just that, however, I think that for Saldana and even John Cho's character, Sulu, should have had more say and more to do. I mean, surely Cho was upset that he didn't have any fight scenes like he did in the first film or he had wished he said more than three lines. Just a personal gripe...\nStar Trek is one of the first blockbuster hits of the summer movie season (followed by Iron Man 3) and there are many more to come. Overall, it was a great film and will surely appeal to a fan base and those looking for a good time at the movies. But, these kinds of movies are just not doing it for me anymore. I mean, I prefer movies that grab me and pick at my brain. Now, I completely understand that this is not the goal of Star Trek or Iron Man intend to implement, but, for me, I'm looking for some different. They have an idea in mind and that is to simply entertain and in this case, it succeeded. This was a great movie, but it is one I'm already forgetting about. \nSo, what do you guys think? I welcome criticism, not only about the film, but my overall review itself (I am no professional). Let me know your thoughts in the comments section below so we can discuss. Thanks guy and go watch movies!!",

The first rebooted Star Trek movie was original & great, this felt like a re-make of The Wrath of Khan but that didn't detract from a great action movie & with plenty of entertainment plus the old humour from the original films is still pretty much present. If you're gonna re-make one of the original movies with a few twists & turns then why not The Wrath of Khan, possibly the best out of the original 10 Trekkie movies! Thankfully they did it justice although I believe Ricardo Montalban was a better Khan with some great quotes from classic novels of Earth's past! Despite the feeling we've been here before it's still a great film & deserves to be in the Star Trek franchise & I'd put it fourth behind Wrath of Khan, Voyage Home & First Contact.",

The poor girl would be utterly traumatised after seeing that. However, Happy go lucky Kirk seems to have absolutely no remorse for any of this at the end. He is the worst Captain Ive ever seen. His decision making is terrible. He shouldve killed Khan in the beginning and certainly should never of taken a seemingly invincible killing machine back onto his ship... He makes terrible decisions and got thousands killed, literally thousands. He should never be in charge of another ship.. The man is a fucking clueless cabbage...

            "content": "Much as I often think JJ Abrams directs films by numbers (lens flare, trademark angles etc), I do love his numbers. This is a right rollicking action movie with quite a lot of heart and a good deal of intelligence. It races from one sequence to another, with barely anytime for the audience to keep up, which serves to (a) make this quite an exhausting 2 hours and 11 minutes, and (b) cover over some of the plot holes that, once you have a few seconds to scrutinise them, are glaringly obvious...\n\nAll that said, there's a lot of great stuff here and it's fantastically entertaining. Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine develop their excellent chemistry and relationship as Spock and Kirk, and there seemed to be less of the annoying comedy accents of Scotty and Chekhov. I also liked the politicking with the senior Starfleet commanders. Best of all is Benedict Cumberbatch, who proves he can do beefcake supervillain as well as intellectial sociopath. He's brilliant and steals every scene he's in.\n\nPLOT SPOILER and major complaint: the last sequence of the film involves a spaceship crashing through downtown San Francisco, demolishing countless skyscrapers and several square miles of city centre. After barely a few seconds to take in the  destruction we cut to 12 months later and almost nothing seems different. The city seems fine, noone mentions the tens of thousands who surely perished. Hmmm - a disappointing, flippant and rushed end to an otherwise terrific film.",

Kirk is an womanizing, disrespectful rebel who is captaining the enterprise by mere luck, and Spock suddenly is more human than vulcan. An alternate timeline should not change the characters so much that they are completely unrecognizable from their ToS selves, and the only reason Nimoy appears is so that J.J. can attempt to spin this as cannon. The only thing in this movie that didn't ruffle my feathers was the choice of Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan. (Technically speaking, it is inaccurate to cast him as Khan considering that an alternate timeline doesn't change a man's heritage, but Benedryl Cucumber's acting is on point.)",

Kirk is immature as always -- and some romance is continuously developing between Nyota and Spock. It's not the most character-driven film -- they seriously lack more development and inside. Antagonist does on the other hand deliver relatable motivations even if a more \"want-to\" to win against him would have made it an even greater film. Cumberbatch brought a big win! It's a more action-anger driven version of what we know Star Trek used to be -- with a mix of mystery, corruption & some \"meh:s\". Visuals & cinematography is a pure wonder yes, but it simply isn't that much of a \"wow\" -- with its less passionate story with fragments of convenient/illogical events & plot holes. The latest installment \"Beyond\" success over this when it comes to character depth -- this is however a better directed and got more focus on story. It's a popcorn-flick for the sci-fi/action fan -- that's for sure. But a \"meh\" ride for others.\n\nPersonal rating: 80/100\nCritical rating: 74/100",

When you strip it down this is a poor version of Good vs Evil placed in a Star Trek setting.

I fell head over heals in love with the new Khan. \n\nThis has kicked Terminator out of 1st place, of my all time favourite movies. Khan is so very b@d @$$ and the conflict between him and the Enterprise crew is so intense. I like how JJ keeps a fast pace of the story, while maintaining an air of mystery, you uncover plot twists just when you stop reeling from the last one, and the comic timing is just hilarious. There's a little bit of everything, a bit of romance, a bit of action, a bit of comedy, a bit of tragedy, a bit of a threat of war, a bit of a moral dilemma, amazing immersive landscapes, really humanising moments, even a bit of nostalgia for the classic fans, all culminating in a cocktail that makes you feel satisfactorily giddy with excitement.\n\nNaturally, I got the DVD too, and I'm wearing it out. \n\nIf SOMEHOW, you've been living under a rock and have managed not to see this.

However, there is a lot of action, excitement, and relief when difficulties are overcome.\n\n    In completing the mission in the opening sequence, Kirk violates the prime directive in order to save Spock who was doing the last part of saving a new species of sentient beings.  Sigh.  Kirk loses command of the Enterprise.\n\n    Admiral Pike finagles getting Kirk to be his First Officer just before there is an attack on a critical Star Fleet installation.  The attack leads to a high level conclave of Star Fleet officers.  Kirk figures this out just before the attack, and manages to blunt (but not stop) its effects.  There are heavy losses.  Kirk gets back the Enterprise, and is ordered to find and kill the perpetrator.  His crew is given special weapons to accomplish this.\n\n    Kirk's quarry is traced to a deserted part of Kronos, the Klingon homeworld.  The quarry's real name is Khan who is the maximal result of a eugenics experiment done many years earlier on Earth.  Admiral Marcus (Pike's superior) had hoped to use Khan against an array of future enemies, such as the Klingons.  Khan and Marcus had a falling out, though, and the whole dynamics of the film is derived from that.\n\n    For the Federation to be brought back to an even keel, Marcus' vision of endless war has to be put aside, and Khan has to be contained somehow.  Just to make things for fun, Carol Marcus, the daughter of the Admiral, stows away on the Enterprise.\n\n    So, will the Enterprise crew be up for it?\n\n-----Scores-----\n\n    Cinematography: 7/10 For the most part, the blending of CGI with real photography was well done.  I saw why there are so many posted complaints about lens flare, however.\n\n    Sound: 6/10 The often symphonic music seemed an odd choice, and only amplified my misgivings about the film.\n\n    Acting: 7/10 Good, except for the miscasting of the pivotal character Khan.  I liked the performances of Karl Urban, John Cho, Simon Pegg, Anton Yelchin, Bruce Greenwood, and Peter Weller quite a lot.\n\n    Screenplay: 5/10  Usually, I watch action films in one sitting with no breaks whatsoever.  This property took me four days to watch, since it just did not interest me that much, at any stage.  The three principals all seemed emotionally childish and short of training for their chosen profession. It seemed utterly unlikely that such incompetence could produce good results in very difficult situations.",

Returning to Earth, Kirk loses command of the Enterprise and Admiral Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood) is reinstated as its commanding officer.

Meanwhile, a secret Section 31 installation in London is bombed by a renegade Starfleet officer, Commander John Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch). During a meeting of Starfleet commanders to discuss the situation, Harrison attacks in a jumpship, killing Pike. Kirk disables the jumpship, but Harrison uses a prototype portable transwarp transporter device to escape to Kronos, the Klingon homeworld, knowing Starfleet would be unable to follow. Fleet Admiral Alexander Marcus (Peter Weller) orders the Enterprise to hunt and kill Harrison, arming them with 72 prototype photon torpedoes, shielded and untraceable to sensors...\n\n\"Star Trek - Into Darkness\" is the second movie in the reboot franchise and this is even a notch better than the first one in my eyes. It´s simply a great action-adventure in space mixing humour, emotional aspects, action, love, death and friendship. I do love what JJ. Abrams have done with the Star Trek universe, most likely to the dismay of Trekkies. I think the casting is near perfect for all the major roles as it was in the first as well and it´s such great ensemble piece. However, I feel that Cumberbatch is a bit too theatrical in his performance at times, but at the same time he manages to add several layers to Khan. You can´t get away from the fact that there´s a solid connection to modern day terrorism in Khan and his actions plus with visuals closely connected to 9/11, it´s even more apparent. It´s a visually stunning film and I found myself jumping in my seat of joy due to this. I can´t bloody wait for the third one...",

Abram's 2009 film, as well as Into Darkness did both, however, seem to have an issue I couldn't overlook in common. And that is that both essentially feel like an incredibly drawn out episode of a TV show. And I've seen next to nothing of the old Star Trek series, so it's not from that sort of a view I've come to have this feeling. It's just a sort of unshakable notion I developed after a few minutes from the start during each film. Even in this aspect, Into Darkness is a slight improvement on its forebear.\n\nThis new Star Trek film is, unfortunately, riddled with plot holes. Some... Or at least one, is completely unforgivable. They're not enough to ruin the film per se, but it does make me wonder about Abram's ability to be a showrunner in the future if he can't even handle Star Trek. Right from the get go I had questions that could have easily been answered with only a couple of lines of dialogue's worth of effort. Which was sad, because it cast a pall over what was, at its heart, an enjoyable piece of cinema.\n\nDespite these issues worsening as the movie progressed, a congratulatory word does again have to go out to Abram's and his team for their tweaked timeline. Working a way in which to successfully reboot the franchise, without belittling the integrity of the original was a great move (moreover, they've left themselves open for more deviations in the future, now that the concept is established). Very smart.\n\nZachary Quinto, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin returning is of course a big plus for me. Completely unsurprisingly there just as fantastic as ever. But, that kind of Tumblr user would I be if I didn't give a special bit of praise to Benedict Cumberbatch (which all levity aside, is actually well earned from the Brit, who makes for a spectacular villain).\n\n69%\n\n-Gimly",

Sadly, that robs me of the ability of directly addressing what I liked best and least about the movie. \n\n For me, this movie was slightly overpromised. The 'A' Cinemascore, all my FB friends raving about it, and all the positive reviews, I somehow allowed myself to believe it could be even better than the 2009 film. That was an unfair expectation on my part. It is certainly better (by far) than any other Trek film or TV show ever made. The special effects are lights-out amazing, and while a couple new characters have been borrowed, their newer versions are *much* more convincing - in fact (gasp!) - one in particular is much better than the original. \n\n But overall, the 2009 film was slightly better, only because it captured the optimism, adventure, and humor at the heart of Roddenberry's series. Into Darkness is an amazing film, but the 2009 movie will always be the standard against which I judge any future Trek product. Still, just like in 2009, anything that can drum up this much mainstream interest in Trek is alright in my book! Into Darkness Grade: A.",

This review will contain major SPOILERS, so be warned now.\n\nThe movie starts out with Kirk and McCoy running from an alien race after taking a scroll. The reason they are on the planet is the volcano is about to erupt and this will be a global catastrophe. The Enterprise and its crew are suppose to stop the eruption without the indigenous population knowing that other lifeforms exist in the universe. And how do they do this? By hiding the Enterprise under the ocean. This starts out bad. First off, the Prime Directive would prevent them from stopping the volcano because that is a natural occurrence, not man-made. Also, the Enterprise can be in orbit and beam the cold-fusion device into the volcano; they don't have to risk the life of their first officer to do this. Also, Uhura is on the shuttle with Sulu? Why is a Communications Officer on this mission? Nonetheless, Kirk orders the Enterprise to reemerge from the ocean, violating the Prime Directive, and save Spock before he is consumed by the lava. Kirk is summarily ripped of his command. Well, it doesn't start off well but it must get better, right? Unfortunately not. The action and effects are very good, but the core of what made Star Trek great has been lost. Karl Urban was, again, the best at portraying Leonard McCoy; but his screen time was very limited. Bennidict Cumberpatch is always a treat to watch on screen but his John Harrison, who turns out to be Khan Noonian Sing, is vastly different than the Khan Trekkers know from Space Seed and Trek 2. For one, this new Khan is obviously British when Khan is suppose to be Indian, a Sikh. This Khan is a murdering psychopath when the Montalban Khan was a calculating dictator. How could the actions of Nero change the nature of a 21st century eugenics superman? Also, how could the actions of Nero change how Klingons now look and act? In this movie, Klingons have blue eyes, wear masks, and don jewelry. Out of all the series (including the cartoon) and movies, this has never been the case. And when has a starship ever been able to get close to the Klingon homeworld without being attacked by a Bird of Prey? Another problem with the Klingons in this movie is that Praxis, the Klingon moon, has been destroyed. Wait, isn't that suppose to happen much later, at the end of the 23rd century? Another problem is Carol Marcus; in Trek 2, Carol Marcus does not have a British accent but she does in this (because Alice Eve is a Brit). They couldn't have her speak with an American accent?\n\nThere are other problems but needless to say, the film is a good action and effects popcorn flick. It is unfortunate that the core of what made Star Trek great has been lost.",

Both the new Star Trek movies, all starting from Genesis and rewriting the entire series a new, was a really welcome surprise. I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie and enjoyed the second one even more. The creators really went out of their way to select a fine cast to play the characters from the original series. While I put a lot of my praise towards Spock and Kirk for their acts, it is Benedict Cumberbatch that recieves the most praise. The guy is a brilliant actor, and comparing his character to the one he was meant to be playing from the original series, I'd say they nailed his personality perfectly.\n\nThis movie just placed Benedict Cumberbatch at the top of my list of favourite actors.\n\nThe movie itself also had a brilliant story. Though a lot of people knew right from the get go who the main villain was and, though the movie was predictable at times with slight elements of fan service in it, I thought it was a really solid movie. If you can make someting out of a series that is practically legendary and known by all, and take your own direction with it like some sort of fanfiction piece turned film, you immediately earn points for that in my opinion.\n\nDefinitely one of my favourite movies of the year that I thoroughly enjoyed, and would go out of my way to watch over and over again.",

Adding younger actors, new lines and whooshing warp effects doesn't do much to make you feel like you're seeing or experiencing anything all that new.  As the late great Roger Ebert once said so eloquently, Star Trek \"was kind of terrific once\", but one would expect more (and new) creative vision from one of the largest sci fi franchises that has spanned decades.  The recycled and predictable plots of saving the universe with sparks, fading shields and neck pinches is running out of gas and a poor vision of the future past the 21st century and lack of \"bold\" creative vision that inspired many in the prime time hours of the early 1970s.",

This works since I swear Abrams is one day going to make Return of the Star Trek Jedi Klingon, and combine both universes into the biggest Sci-Fi Nerdgasm of all time (and the Internet will explode). There's still room for more of the crew though, Kirk and Spock get plenty, Uhura gets more than enough, happily Simon Pegg's Scotty gets a bigger role this time, but I would have loved more Karl Urban as Bones, because he's just so good. Here's hoping enough other people feel the same way. Frankly Chekov is almost a joke in these films, and Sulu is a solid presence but has the right amount of screen time.\nThe effects are great, but if anything there's too much noise that makes it hard to hear dialogue in some places. \nBenedict Cumberbatch is phenomenal as ever, in an action role, and Peter Weller is good fun as well.\nI won't give any spoilers but there's some very cool stuff that sets up the next few movies.\nA solid outing, and this time, entertainment really trumps all my complaints.",

Kirk), Zachery Quinto(Mr.Spock), Zoe Saladna(Uhura), Simon Pegg(Scotty), John Chu(Sulu), Alice Eve(Carol Marcus),and Benedict Cummberbatch(John Harrison)\nMy Review\nMy history with the Star Trek franchise is very little, I have only seen a few episodes of Star Trek:The Next Generation, watched Wrath of Khan and the Star Trek reboot from 2009. Although my mother has been with this franchise since the beginning. She watched the very first show, The next Generation and watched all the movies.\nI guess your thinking my mother dragged me to see this with her but she didn't I wanted to go see this film but not because I love Star Trek. I wanted to see this film because the villain looked threatening and sounded awesome. The villain in the first Star Trek film to me wasn't memorable but to me the one this film was way more memorable and the first film didn't do this, they didn't have their characters of Starship Enterprise explore new worlds like they did in the show.\nThe film revolves around captain James T. Kirk who doesn't follow the guidelines of Starfleet and is assigned to go downward from captian to first officer. Until a man named John Harrison attacks the commanders of Starfleet and becomes a fugitive. Kirk must prove he is a worthy captain by leading his crew to a manhunt to a war zone world to capture him.\nThe actors do a great job at portraying their characters and I honestly do believe this sequel is better then the first film that for some reason alot of people like and have even heard that the previous film is better then this one even though as I said that the villain is unmemorable and they don't capture the essence of Starfleets mission which is too seek out new worlds and to boldly go where no man has gone before. The special effects are better then any other of the Star Trek adaptations of course and it is a better and greater thrill ride I give this Star Trek film a 5 out of 5 I think some Star Trek fans will love it while others may not apparently.",

There's also no payoff to all the problems that the Enterprise's crew goes through.  In the end, there's no real punishment for Khan, so what the hell was the point of all this?  He killed thousands of people and got away with it.  Yeah, he's in hibernation indefinitely, but it's only a matter of time until somebody sets him free I'm sure...perhaps for a sequel sometime down the line.

I cannot stress how much I appreciate that he never seems to cut corners production-wise, you can always see, and hear, every penny invested on his films put to good use. He also has a really underrated ability with actors, creating tightly woven ensembles that bounce off each other well. That said, he desperately (!) needs better writers. His tendency to work with middling scripts is far too frequent and worrisome; I wonder how far he could go without such a huge obstacle right from the beginning. Now that he's directing that little movie called Star Wars VII he should do something about it, his life (or at least sanity) depends on it.\n\nSome other random thoughts: 1. Simon Pegg is THE shit. Earned comic relief in this post Marvel movie's landscape is practically unheard of, and to me he always delivers the goods. Effortlessly. 2. Giacchino's \"Enterprising Young Men\" still gives me hardcore chills. I refuse to believe that it will ever grow old, and I would pay serious money to hear it performed live with a full orchestra. 3. I'm getting used to this 3D stuff, which kind of boggles my mind. You just can't refuse all that gloriously sharp eye candy coming off the screen, especially when rendered in such beautiful color schemes. Yeah, Abrams is good with that too.",

It seems to have two purposes: 1) To try to change the target audience from people that love Star Trek to mindless adolescents who don't know much about it. I.e. to try to make it cool and have lots of mindless running around. And 2) To give something to existing fans with nostalgic bits from the past, including riding on the back of Wrath of Khan. It fails in the latter, thats why its a failure, and it ruins the work of the last film. It made money, but anyone that like Star Trek would have paid to see it just because its Star Trek and because the last film was so good. It may have succeeded in gaining their new audience, I don't know, but to me that just means that any future films will be no better than made for TV 'Baywatch'. The film is full of holes and stupidity. For example, the super-genius Khan's brilliant plan to free his people is to load them into missiles. Missiles that he knows will be fired at a planet. Nowhere in the film is indicated how he intends to remove those people before the missiles actually hit the ground. Is this how one rescues a person? Not to mention all the different processing that will happen to the missiles by strangers before they actually get fired - they are after all, an extra special military weapon. The military does not tend to just leave such things in a back warehouse with no testing and monitoring. This stuff annoyed me to no end, but add to that the mindless running around, e.g. Kirk running around the big ship and the silly jumping between ships through space. If this wasn't enough, there is the needless, cloyingly bad nostalgic looking back, e.g. the famous Spock dying of radiation scene. The people that saw the original scene will still remember it and didn't need to see an inferior version repeated. Those that never saw it before were not going to be impressed with it in this film, it was just boring as there isn't the great emotional bond between Spock and Kirk here. In addition, if you're trying to sell to people that like mindless running around and jumping between flying boats, what's the point of this scene? I went in there knowing nothing of the story, I didn't know it was based around Khan, else I may not have watched it. Wrath of Khan was a great film, a classic. They should have left it alone. They obviously ran out of ideas for the follow up to the last film. A big big let down on such great promise. I wish I hadn't seen it. Abrams is good but he is much over-hyped - something that screw up that talent (in the short term anyway). The new Star Wars could be either great or rubbish.",

They have a lot of great action, good casting, and even all of the nonsensical tech of the old films. Not to mention plenty of references and fan service. \n\nBut I have come to realize that those things were never what I found appealing about Star Trek; they're petty affectations. Without the character development and grand sci-fi concepts of the previous Trek universe, this film is just a heartless, soulless husk wearing a Federation uniform. \n\nStar Trek was never about huge action scenes or dazzling special effects. I mean half of the decisions they made during the series were to save on their budgets. But because of that, the previous series and movies had more room to breathe and engage the mind. It had to be written almost like a stage play because they couldn't afford to have too many set changes or massive battle scenes. Going from that to this is like trying to remake Twelve Angry Men as an action thriller.\n\nAll of that characterization and exploration of concepts is now awash in a sea of lens flare. This film, much more than the first, is an extremely predictable blockbuster title with really nothing to say. Is that certain bad guy going to get back up in a 'he's not quite dead' moment? Of course he is. Is that certain hero going to be resurrected after making a tragic sacrifice? Well, this being summer popcorn fare, they wouldn't want to leave on even a bittersweet note now would they? There are so many cliche moments in this film that it seems more like a pastiche of overdone action moments from the past 30 years than it does an original effort. You can call everything that's going to happen, which is extremely deflating.\n\nIf there is another Star Trek film in the rebooted series, I really hope Abrams takes time to slow down and smell the alien roses. I also hope I'm not alone in not needing constant, migraine inducing action in order to stay interested. Give Star Trek a little space, and some room to breathe and find its humanity, and it can do great things. Otherwise, it just isn't anything special.",

            "content": "For J.J. Abrams second outing into the Star Trek universe, I found Star Trek Into Darkness to be only a little more well thought out than its predecessor.  The story picks up some months after the events of Star Trek and the crew of the Enterprise is taking part to assist in saving a primitive alien race from total annihilation.  As part of the action, Kirk must decide to risk exposing themselves in an effort to save Spock, thus breaking the Prime Directive.  It then follows on down a path of sedition in Starfleet after a rogue agent causes a bombing in London and attacks Starfleet brass in San Francisco.  We find out said agent is in fact Khan, the same character introduced in the original series and film, The Wrath of Khan.  \nNow that you know the general gist of the story, let me tell you why I really don't like it.  I'm a hardcore Trekkie, yes, but I'm also someone with a fairly open mind about Star Trek.  I like new ideas and I like how a new spin can breathe life into an aging franchise.  However, this movie is only marginally better at telling a great Star Trek story than its predecessor.  Does it have lots of sexy action and a whole new shiny look to it? Yes, but it also tries to be intentionally better than that which came before it.  The flashy looks and action isn't all that necessary if you have a good story.  Star Trek Into Darkness doesn't have that; in fact it is literally regurgitating another story already told in this mythos.  I will say that I liked this movie more than the last one, but J.J. Abrams has a lot learn if he is going to keep the legions of fans coming back for more.  I can only imagine what it will spell for Star Wars: Episode VII.",

Kirk and Spock's friendship is strained as Spock is trying balance his out right honesty and loyalty towards the captain. \n\nBenedict Cumberbatch, best known for his leading role in successful BBC series Sherlock steals the show with a outstanding performance as Harrison.

Alice Eve is brought in to play scientist, Dr Carole Wallace.

He was cold hearted, deceiving looking, and hell-bent on finding destruction. There were some great action scenes in this movies, particularly the one where Khan and Kirk are flying through space in advanced \"jumpsuits.\" Dialogue did not seem to be a problem for the people who formulated the script (Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, and Roberto Orci) as it was always witty and sharp. Zachary Quinto, again reprised his role as Spock, and did a decently fine job at that. He is convincing more and more lately, that he can pretty much act in anything. Star Trek: Into Darkness has some very intense scenes that are emotional, subtle, and destructive. This space opera is done with diligent pacing, and some of the finest use of special effects I've seen in a while. J.J. Abrams is taking directing to a whole new level with a nearly flawless movie. My only complaint would be that the camera scenes were beginning to resemble what Michael Bay does in his movies. SHAKY. I swear, Michael Bay has terrets. Anyways, the movie leans more so on the emotional side than one would've expected. What's different between the beloved franchises of Star Wars and Star Trek, is the Star Trek has a director that's made two movies in a row that have been brilliant with an emotional tear drop or two. Yes, Star Wars Episodes VII-XV got the J.J. Abrams treatment as well, but we have no idea what's going to become of them (there are rumors swirling around the Benedict Cumberbatch has a role!) yet. So, lets rewind to the Episodes I-III. Does anyone actually remember a good, emotional scene in those movies? Neither do I. To say that George Lucas can't write a love scene, or an emotional scene, is to say that facebook is just a website. A complete understatement. So, drawing parallels with the Star Trek universe and the Star Wars universe should be easier unless J.J. Abrams botches things up with Episode VII like George Lucas did with Episodes I and II. On an earlier note, however, this movie has got the goods. Go watch it. There is never a dull scene with any of these actors/actresses, and the director gives it his all with a non cliched movie with even a little touch of humor.",

The action is about right and not over the top as in so many Hollywood projects these days and the writing seems to actually go someplace most of the time.  All in all an enjoyable installment.  (I would personally still take The Wrath of Khan over all the other films in this family though.)",
