    "summary": "In mid-1980s Texas, electrician Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is stunned to learn that he has AIDS. Though told that he has just 30 days left to live, Woodroof refuses to give in to despair. He seeks out alternative therapies and smuggles unapproved drugs into the U.S. from wherever he can find them. Woodroof joins forces with a fellow AIDS patient (Jared Leto) and begins selling the treatments to the growing number of people who can't wait for the medical establishment to save them.",

Brought back memories of friends and family members who had HIV that turned into full blown AIDS, another thing  at the time two of my friends doctors were calling theirs ARC in the end it was AIDS. Drugs weren't available for them here in America, like in this movie you had to go outside our country  to get any relief. This movie brought out a lot of what we didn't offer to keep men and women alive, what one would do to get them, and how they were treated in this era, you couldn't kiss, hug or be close to a person,  towards anyone with HIV, they were shunned by many that is a fact!  That part made me sick to watch in this movie, and in real life what I had to see happen to my friends and family member!  \nThis has nothing to do with the movie: Time has changed since then, they know you can't catch it unless you have sex, blood, or share a needle!  That being said we still  have a long ways to still go, and  I loved the acting, and this movie.",

Don't knock this to the side, this movie was pretty much the reason I started watching other flicks with Mr McConaughey in them.

From homophobic, hateful, and cruel to an incredibly humane, loving and loyal person who sees through the differences that once made him uncomfortable, Ron has got to be one of my favorite character progressions to date. Even apart from scenes of death and heartache there were many times I cried happily through Dallas Buyers Club. Pretty much every scene where his love and respect for Rayon becomes more and more apparent, I was crying. Now this could be because I am apart of the community (LGBT+) but even not having dealt with this level of hate, I was immediately transported to this time and feeling in my core how difficult this must have been for my people in this era. It was to the point where people were literally being left to die because LGBT+ people were hated so much and they were thought to be the only ones who get the virus. It gave me true perspective to the time and the struggle of the 80s, breaking my heart over and over and then warming it right back up with Rons growing compassion for people other than himself.

The disease that would come to be known as HIV (which can develop into AIDS) exploded onto the scene, referred to as \"the gay cancer,\" and primarily impacting, and killing, gay men back in the early 1980s. \n\nIn Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey plays Ron Woodroof, a Texas man who is diagnosed as HIV-positive and given only 30 days to live. Alone and abandoned by those closest to him, he takes matters into his own hands and begins seeking alternative treatments through unconveiowal, often illegal means. This is a deeply moving, yet disturbing film that tracks the struggle for acceptance in the characters, essentially left to die with no cure (nor management, like is available today) in sight. It forces viewers to witness accounts of HIV-positive individuals who are shunned, stigmatized, and stripped of their dignity. Jared Leto also delivers a solid performance here (with a physical transformation that makes him near unrecognizable), though his casting as a transgender woman was a misfire that takes away an opportunity for true representation. Nonetheless, the issues within Dallas Buyers Club is an important entry into the LGBTQIA film pantheon. Note, however, that this is my opinion as a cisgender male and should not be substituted for the views of those in the transgender community.\n\nWe are entering a time where cinema is making strides (albeit slowly) in representation, whether in race, sexual orientation, or other areas. I believe that the heart-wrenching Dallas Buyers Club was a step in the right direction, casting a popular lead actor to head a film tackling issues long overdue for discussion. It also is a production from which Hollywood should learn that representation matters.",

He fights for his life. Endours horrible discrimination. He tries to get on the clinical trial for HIV treatment. But is rejected. He starts out being homophobic  but he suffers a homophobic attacks himself (even though he is a heterosexual man) his ignorant \"friends\" think he is gay, as he has HIV. And persecute him for it. He goes through a transformation. Both litrally and figuratively. He cant get treatment. So he comes up with his own. He just refuses to give up. He clings to life like the disease that clings to him. He helps many others who are stuck in the same position. Its quite an amazing journey. And it's true. \nAll in all, this is an emotional film that is a must watch for Mathew McConaughey fans. Give it a watch. \n\nRon: \"You enjoy your life, little lady. You only got one.\"",

The story is very entertaining and it moves at a slow pace but that is what the story calls for but I am not complaining about that.

            "content": "Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e has gained a reputation as a somewhat stodgy director of actor driven vehicles that get by on the strength of their performances while being otherwise unmemorable. I have not yet seen Wild (2014) but considering my impression of this film upon first watching it I would have to agree. Matthew McConaughey deservedly won an Academy Award for his powerful leading performance and Jennifer Garner gives a typically robust supporting turn but beyond their work the film is otherwise fairly unremarkable. It's not that it isn't worthwhile viewing over two hours as it presents mote than many other \u2018Based on a True Story' Academy Award nominees but don't go in expecting a masterpiece.\n\nDrug addicted cowboy Ron Woodroof, Matthew McMonaughey, spends his days having sex with prostitutes and hanging out with his friends at the rodeo where they share their racist, sexist and homophobic views. Woodroof is forced to change when he is diagnosed with AIDS as a result of having unprotected sex with a prostitute. Initially in denial he eventually decides that he needs to treat his condition and despite the efforts of Dr. Eve Saks, Jennifer Garner, he is unable to legally obtain necessary drugs to treat his condition. He goes from stealing AZT, a drug that is being prescribed in dangerously large doses, to traveling to Mexico so that he can purchase different, more effective drugs. With the help of the transgender drug addict Rayon, Jared Leto, he starts selling the drugs to others suffering from AIDS and his prejudices are challenged as he befriends homosexuals. Meanwhile Saks is concerned about the fact that the financial benefits to pharmaceutical companies are valued over the lives of sufferers by the FDA in legally approving drugs. She and Woodroof learn to work together so that they can advocate their cause but Rayon's health begins to fail and Woodroof stares down his own mortality.\n\nMcConaughey grounds the entire film as he resolutely refuses to remove any of the rough edges from his character and we get the sense that we are really watching a red blooded American male in the first half of the film. Of course he is eventually humanized but McConaughey never loses the sliminess and barely repressed anger that made this man so believable as a person who would achieve something positive for not entirely altruistic purposes. It probably helps that he is Texan so the accent isn't botched as it could have been were a respected British actor to take on this role but in the way he holds himself he shows a man with a loud, unearned confidence. There was also much made about his extreme weight loss and while his \u2018commitment' to his role is admirable he does more than Christian Bale in Vice (2018) or many other prestige performances that involved physical transformation.\n\nThe pacing of the film is also well judged as we follow our protagonist going through a fairly typical character with occasional cuts to other characters but Vall\u00e9e keeps the action moving at a steady pace and gives us time to process developments. Considering some of the lengthier films I have watched recently it was something of a relief to see a film that chooses not to add too many bells and whistles to a story that benefits from an unfussy style of storytelling. We follow people who live lives driven by simple desires, getting drunk and having sex, and having flashy camerawork poring over the horror of suburbia and various low rent strip clubs would seem out of place. We need to feel at home in this environment and this is a film that seems comfortable in these environments as much as it pushes it's main character to move beyond cheap gratification but has compassion for him even in these moments. As much as there are moments that could use some sprucing up for lack of a better term it is better to have a minimalist, highly controlled director working on this production than a director more prone to histrionic performances and hammy camerawork.\n\nThe film won't change the minds of those who are horribly homophobic and it could be accused of overstating the moral points it presents but because McConaghey and Garner are such reliable presences you can't help but be drawn in.",

Director Jean-Marc Vallee matches slick panning shots and rapid fire cuts with devastating close up shots and long held shots on characters to rip the emotions out of you. Dallas Buyers Club is well crafted by Vallee with a careful purpose to not go too far to offend the subjects or people like them. Dallas Buyers Club is a success of human empathy in understanding the victims of a terrible disease with no cure and only treatment.\n\nTreatment is the main theme in Dallas Buyers Club as we see a man treated poorly by others and he once did to them, so that he must change in order to help treat other patients of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Here as we follow Matthew McConaughey's brilliant and awe inspiring performance as Ron Woodroof. His treatment by doctors, of doctors, and instead of doctors leaves a hole in your heart. His massive weight loss is startling to witness with his gaunt frame and hollow eyes. But McConaughey's real talent is in portraying the complex humanity in Woodroof, who goes from a wastrel homophobe to a brave survivor that helps others live on despite their illness. McConaughey is brilliant in Dallas Buyers Club and certainly earned his Best Actor Oscar. He gave a sincere and hard to watch realistic display of empathy and compassion. He is an incredible actor.\n\nSimilarly, Jared Leto goes all in as the highly effeminate Rayon. His tender voice and kindly persona give Rayon a warm welcoming vibe that is quite endearing. I found his portrayal of this dying angel to feel sincere, captivating, and heartrending. There is a profound sadness to his character that feels hopeless, but his lively personality lends a genuine charm to Dallas Buyers Club. I love Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club and I am glad he won Best Supporting Actor for such a powerful performance.\n\nLastly, I must mention that Jennifer Garner gives what is perhaps her greatest acting performance alongside two outstanding acting depictions from McConaughey and Leto. Garner feels so genuine as a doctor that desperately wants to help her dying patients. She comes across as very sweet and intelligent.\n\nDallas Buyers Club feels all the more important as it brings to light the FDA and federal government's profiteering off of dying patients in order to prevent their curing. Doctors and businesses refusing to hear, help, or accept outside research is shocking and upsetting to see. Who knows how many have died who could have been treated with better medicine instead of dying at the hands of doctors just prescribing what they are told to by the FDA. Dallas Buyers Club thus feels immediate and significant. There should be serious change in the world of medicine as medical costs still skyrocket in America as millions go without coverage or health insurance. Where will the dying get their medicine and treatment from if not from the doctors? Dallas Buyers Club gives an alternative that is worth hearing.\n\nI highly recommend Dallas Buyers Club as a gripping biopic of immense sorrow and hardship, while doubling as a humanistic drama of understanding those that are different that you. Dallas Buyers Club also perseveres as a infuriating account of medical reform that is so very necessary.",

            "content": "An award winning performance paired with a riveting true story.\n\nMatthew McConaughey stars in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB as real-life Texas cowboy Ron Woodroof, whose free-wheeling life was overturned in 1985 when he was diagnosed as HIV-positive and given 30 days to live. These were the early days of the AIDS epidemic, and the U.S. was divided over how to combat the virus. Ron, now shunned and ostracized by many of his old friends, and bereft of government-approved effective medicines, decided to take matters in his own hands, tracking down alternative treatments from all over the world by means both legal and illegal. Bypassing the establishment, the entrepreneurial Woodroof joined forces with an unlikely band of renegades and outcasts - who he once would have shunned - and established a hugely successful \"buyers' club.\" Their shared struggle for dignity and acceptance is a uniquely American story of the transformative power of resilience. \n\nBefore watching this film the other night, I honestly had no idea what it was about. In fact, I hadn't realized how recently it was released. So, my friends and I sat down with a bottle of wine, popped it open, and go to watching. To no surprise, this film was flat out amazing and Matthew McConaughey's performance was riveting. He immersed himself in the role and made a name for himself here. This was not only a great all around film, but a fantastic one at that. \n\nLet's talk about Matthew McConaughey for a second. This man has had some pretty great moments over the years but this might be one of my favorite pieces of work from him. This guy really immersed himself in the role and certainly put on a show. I think he lead the cast along with Jared Leto, who was absolutely breathless in this role. These two really stole the show and gave performances for their careers. Jennifer Garner and others were no less than great and the cast certainly pushed this film to greatness. \n\nAbout halfway through this film I thought to myself, \"Is this a true story?\". Low and behold, it's based on a true story and that's the crazy part to me. Ron Woodruff wasn't a standout guy by any means but based on what I saw here, he did something that most would hesitate to do. I don't want to say much without looking more into what happened but if there's one thing to be said, it's that I'm really in awe at what happened here and I'd love to learn more about it. \n\nI think that it was also a great insight to be able to look into a different decade and see how others were treated differently. The aids phenomenon and transgender situations were relatively new and people didn't much about them. People were scared and they treated people like shit. While there are still problems today, it's a huge difference compared to what it was back then. I just thought it was really eye opening to see those kinds of situations on screen. \n\nIn the end, I thought this film was fantastic. I certainly wish that I watched this film earlier and it's something that I can't wait to add to my collection.",

Let s recap.\n\nSCOTT: It s 1985 and Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is not in the best of health. He s shown to be a young cowboy who lives life in the fast lane. We see him immersed in hard-drinking, gambling, and seemingly endless sexual encounters with many different women. One day, after a fairly minor encounter with the law, Woodroof collapses and is sent to the hospital.\n\nGREG: He learns that he has full-blown AIDS and has 30 days to live. Flabbergasted, he researches his condition at the library and learns that a new drug - AZT - is in trials at his local hospital. Unable to get into the trials, he bribes an orderly to sell him AZT. When the drug doesn t work for him, he goes on a bender and wakes up in a Mexico clinic where an American doctor (who had his licence revoked) treats him for his AIDS symptoms and tells him the AZT was killing him as fast as the AIDS. Woodroof is amazed at his recovery and packs his car with enough supplies to treat 300 people. But he has a hard time selling to the gay community because he s homophobic. He enlists the aid of a drag queen and his business takes off \n\nSCOTT: Greg, I hereby declare 2013 the year of the real life biopic in the movies. We ve seen many films this year that are based on, or inspired by, real life events -- Captain Phillips, Philomena, The Book Thief, 12 Years a Slave, Saving Mr. Banks, among others. As with all these other true-to-life biopics, Dallas Buyers Club is a high quality story. Our hero Woodroof starts out an unlikeable jerk, a sexist, intolerant, drug-abusing, homophobic pig. His character shows slow, gradual growth in this movie. At first he s just looking to stay alive. Then he s motivated by greed when he sees a profit to be made in importing unapproved medications into the U.S.  Slowly but surely, as he sees people suffering in droves, his motives shift toward being more altruistic. It s an interesting transformation to watch.\n\nGREG: It s an engrossing hero s journey. And as with most hero s journeys, we need a villain. The villain in this story is the Food and Drug Administration. But the FDA is too nebulous an organization so the local doctor becomes the embodiment of the misdirected search for an HIV cure. They re focused on AZT which is toxic to the human body in large doses. The trials don t look good but the doctor keeps on with the program because AZT is the only treatment that is approved by the FDA. What puts Woodroof in opposition with this doctor and the FDA is his untested and unapproved  supplements.  The FDA wants to protect the public from snake oil salesmen (and boy does Woodroof visibly fit that bill), but turns a blind eye toward research that is going on in other parts of the world. This then creates the tension between Woodroof and his villain. And to contrast the good with the bad, Woodroof befriends a female doctor who is involved in the AZT trial - Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner). She is at first opposed to Woodroof s approach. But as the story builds, she begins to see that the FDA and her boss are moving too slowly and dogmatically to address the needs of their patients.\n\nSCOTT: You re right, Greg. Woodroof s courageous journey is only made possible by the resistance he encounters by a healthcare bureaucracy that seems designed to thwart progress in combatting AIDS. It was a wise choice to show that the medical establishment was not entirely against Woodroof. His relationship with Dr. Saks and her growing appreciation for Woodroof s buyers club is an important part of the story. It is interesting to see how Woodroof s homophobia and intolerance wanes. His growing fondness and respect for Rayon (Jared Leto) is fascinating and rewarding to watch. When Ryon dies, he is outraged and no longer tolerates homophobic behavior from others. His transformation for elitism to egalitarianism is exactly the kind of evolution in character that we want to see in any good hero story.\n\nGREG: I enjoyed Dallas Buyer s Club for the hero s journey as much as McConaugheys performance. It s impressive to watch Woodroof s growth as a person and to see him treat so many people at a time when HIV/AIDS was a death sentence. I give Dallas Buyer s Club 5 out of 5 Reels and Woodroof 5 out of 5 Heroes. Movie: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: McConaughey s performance is indeed stellar. His physical transformation as an actor was as dramatic as his character s transformation as a hero. I enjoyed Dallas Buyers Club but rate it a notch below your rating, Greg. I give it 4 out of 5 Reels. The hero transformation was dramatic and contained many elements of the classic hero journey. Woodroof enters a special world and encounters a mentor and several allies and villains. In the end, in order to triumph, he must overcome his own inner demons along with a resistant medical community. For these reasons, I agree he earns 5 out of 5 Heroes. Movie: Heroes:",

Has he learned nothing?! I can't believe the AZT medication was actually killing his cell count. These fucking pharmaceutical company's man, really hard to trust them. Unbelievable how he became healthier by going to some small operating doctor in Mexico.\n\nJared Leto's character is great. The premise of the story is very interesting. It makes you question a lot of things, namely, Big Pharma.

This movie has surprising sense of good humor. \n\nI'm glad that nurse doctor did what she did telling them to go fuck themselves. It's bullshit the amount of shady shit that goes on that the people don't know about.

When he got himself AIDS, he wanted everything he can to heal himself out of it, even partner up with a transgender named Rayon (Jared Leto) and created a business out of it. I remember when I've first seen it and was very happy that McConaughey and Leto won Oscars, and so I saw it again, and I I still enjoyed it a lot. Matthew McConaughey definitely went through Christian Bale's way of losing a lot of weight, and he plays it different than what I typically see in him, which makes me enjoy him very much while he gives one of his best performances. It's probably the first movie that I took notice of Jared Leto even though I've seen him in something like Fight Club, and it was because he was playing a transgender character, and it was very convincing to see him act that character, more so than I did with him as the Joker. Jennifer Garner was also pretty good, and it's nice to see her in a film as I haven't seen her in awhile. The movie did a good job of establishing the main character from being a horrible man, to a likable person that actually is charming in a way to women. The writing by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack is very good that there was never a dull moment in it. I honestly had no idea where it was going as the character changes, and there's a lot of things going on that is very unpredictable. Dallas Buyers Club is a terrific film that brought out the bests from Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto while giving out a great story.",

Look at the list of these Oscar winners:\n\n\tCliff Robertson, in CHARLY (1968), for playing an intellectually disabled man.\n\tJon Voight, in COMING HOME (1978), for playing a paraplegic.\n\tRobert De Niro, in RAGING BULL (1980), a role for which he reportedly gained 60 pounds.\n\tDustin Hoffman, in RAIN MAN (1988), for playing an autistic savant.\n\tDaniel Day-Lewis, in MY LEFT FOOT (1989), for playing a man who has cerebral palsy.\n\tTom Hanks, in PHILADELPHIA (1993), for playing a man who is dying of AIDS.\n\tGeoffrey Rush, in SHINE (1996), for playing a man who has suffered a mental breakdown.\n\tColin Firth, in THE KING'S SPEECH (2010), for playing a king who has a speech impediment.\n\nAnd that's just the men.\n\nOkay, I'll agree that these are all great movies, and the awards and accolades they earned were well deserved but what if there is something to this?\n\nEnter DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, a film that ticks more than one of the above boxes. Actors Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, who both play men with AIDS, reportedly lost 38 and 40 pounds respectively for their roles... but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nIt's 1985 and Texas electrician Ron Woodroof is as wild as the bulls he rides in his spare time. He lives a devil-may-care existence, spending all of his disposable income on women, Jack Daniels and cocaine. After Ron collapses at home, he wakes up in the hospital to be greeted by two doctors who are wearing masks and rubber gloves. It's very early days for HIV and AIDS (it was first clinically observed in the US only four years earlier), and back then it was believed that the virus could be transmitted through saliva.\n\nRon is told that he has AIDS but he refuses to believe it. After all, he thinks that only \"queers\" like Rock Hudson get the disease. Although the doctors tell him that his case is so advanced that he only has about 30 days left to live, he sets out trying to get the then experimental drug AZT for himself. He finds a hospital janitor who is willing to steal the hospital's supply of the drug for a fee and, when that supply line dries up, Ron heads for the Mexican border where he hears the drug is readily available. There, he meets a disgraced American doctor who puts him on a cocktail of vitamins and fatty acids instead of the potentially poisonous AZT. The new treatment seems to work and Ron starts to feel better. He then has the idea to smuggle these medications into Texas and offer them to other AIDS sufferers. He hears about \"buyers' clubs\" that have sprung up across the country where people pay a flat fee every month in exchange for all the meds they need. Along with Rayon, a transvestite Ron meets in the hospital, the Dallas Buyers Club is born.\n\nI'll be honest, I am not a fan of Matthew McConaughey - at least I wasn't until I watched this film. I always thought his \"screen looks to acting ability coefficient\" was up in the Tom Cruise range but, with this film, he has made me reconsider him. In DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, McConaughey has delivered the performance of his career. Woodruff is crude, funny, opportunistic, smart and caring, and McConaughey handles each aspect of his character with an assurance that we've never seen from him before. The boy can act and if he does land the Best Actor Oscar (R), it will be well deserved.\n\nGo see this movie - not just for Matthew McConaughey's performance but also for Jared Leto's, who plays Rayon. I wouldn't be surprised if he wins the Best Supporting Actor Oscar (R).",

It would have been easy to portray them as heroes or villains and to add to the endless pile of 'true story' crap-fests that we see all the time. Instead though, we see a drama where the characters are presented as real human beings and WHY ON EARTH IS THIS SO RARE IN THE FIRST PLACE!?\n\nThis really is a performance-driven film and it's driven by multiple strong ones, as opposed to just one. McConaughey in particular did a fantastic job of giving his character depth without ever offering it at the expense of realism and Leto managed to prove that he was Rayon because he understood the character, not because it was another gimmick (and trust me, I went in fully-expecting to come out disappointed in his performance- sorry Jared). \n\nThe film's commitment to keeping grounded does make it feel a bit stale at times, as the story trudges along for a while before it ever really gets going.

            "content": "\"There ain't nothing out there that can kill Ron Woodroof in 30 days.\" -Ron Woodroof\n\nHe was right. The Texas electrician lived with HIV and AIDS for the better part of seven years, from 1985 until his death in 1992. During those seven years, he founded a group that passed illegally trafficked drugs to other HIV/AIDS-stricken men and women. It was called the Dallas Buyers Club, and it's the basis of a very good film by the same name.\n\nDallas Buyers Club (the movie) has a near herculean task at its core. It needs to make us care about an angry, hostile man-who also happens to be a raging homophobe-after he learns he's going to die. Almost as miraculous as the fact that Woodroof lasted those seven years is the fact that Matthew McConaughey, playing Woodroof, and director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e do make us care. Woodroof never becomes a particularly likable man, but his hardened, macho exterior melts away while he extends lives. He gives himself meaning for arguably the first time in his life while learning to accept others for their differences. It's a beautiful arc, and even though its told in a sometimes frustrating paint-by-numbers way, there's more than enough meat on Dallas Buyers Club's bones (even if there's hardly any on McConaughey's).\n\nThe film wastes no time. It introduces us immediately to Ron's homophobia and disease. He's hacking up a lung playing cards with some pals and discussing Rock Hudson's disease and sexuality. Not long after that, he's hospitalized, which is when he's told he has 30 days to get his affairs in order.\n\nWoodroof denies the diagnosis at first; HIV is a homo's disease. But he does his research, realizes the truth, and pays off a janitor at the hospital to get him some AZT, which is the only drug approved by the FDA to treat the disease in humans. His physician, Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner), is mildly suspicious of the swift way the drug sailed through the approval process, but the only medical professional Woodroof can track down with proof and an alternative is Dr. Vass (Griffin Dunne), an American operating a \"hospital\" in Mexico. He \"prescribes\" Woodroof some vitamins and proteins and implores Ron to kick his worst habits-cocaine, unhealthy eating, and AZT.\n\nIt works wonders for Ron, so he smuggles boxes and boxes over the border to sell. A transgender client, Rayon (Jared Leto), opens some doors into the gay community, and soon, our man has a full-fledged business on his hands. To get around FDA regulations, he stops selling the drugs and starts giving them away to customers who pay $400 a month to join the DBC.\n\nOne of 2012's better documentaries, How to Survive a Plague, documented this time in American history quite well. People were afraid that spit, touching, breathing, anything could spread the virus, and as such, the known infected became pariahs within their community. They protest the FDA and big pharma to try everything at their disposal to save lives. In Dallas Buyers Club, there's quite a bit of that going on. While Ron isn't trafficking anything that's against the law, he's taking patients away from AZT trials. Results be damned, they'll shut Ron down-they'll even change laws-if it means they aren't performing as expected financially. This material is among Dallas Buyers Club's strongest. It'll get your blood boiling.\n\nRon's transformation, meanwhile, is beautifully acted by McConaughey, and the supporting work from both Leto and Garner can't be overstated. Down a good 50 pounds from his usual weight, he clearly goes above and beyond physically. Emotionally, meanwhile, he's gentle with this fragile character. The screenplay isn't, unfortunately. Title cards track time passed, and the choppiness to the character work makes that piece feel a bit unsatisfying. (See the scene at the grocery store with Rayon, for example. It comes out of nowhere.) McConaughey, though-he fights the screenplay's weaknesses and makes us care about and believe in Ron even when we shouldn't. It's a tricky distinction to make, but it's clear on the screen-this guy navigates these rough waters quite well.\n\nI mentioned Leto and Garner in passing, but their achievements shouldn't be overlooked either. The former has the decidedly showier role, and while it too suffers from a choppiness that comes with a story told this way, the actor lights up every scene he's in. Garner does something more interesting, I'd argue. She makes a mostly passive bystander of a character her own, imbuing Eve with the qualities you see in many of Garner's past characters-a certain endearing type-A-ness, a reluctance to take chances, etc.\n\nBy covering so much ground-chronicling one man's struggle with a terminal illness, transforming him from homophobe to LGBT ally, depicting the personal and social side effects of living with HIV/AIDS, showing us what the political climate was during this period of the epidemic, and more-Dallas Buyers Club was bound to feel a little meandering, even incomplete. But the film we have is nonetheless quite stunning. With a lead performance that deserves to be remembered for years to come and direction that appropriately doesn't take attention away from that leading man, Dallas Buyers Club is powerful, absorbing prestige fare.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/dallas-buyers-club-review/",

The film features fantastic performances, especially from McConaughey and Jared Leto, with Jennifer Garner doing a decent job in a supporting role. However, the film feels a little bare at times. The story is engaging and interesting, but it's told in a simple fashion. Not to say that that means this is a bad film, because it isn't; however, I just felt that some of the emotional beats were missed.

            "content": "A straight man (a homophobic straight man, nonetheless) with HIV when AIDS was thought of as a \"gay man's disease\". A person with HIV in the 1980s, when there were virtually no effective treatments available in the United States. That's the nearly impossible position in which Ron Woodroof found himself, and it's his real-life story that's told in \"Dallas Buyers Club\" (R, 1:57).\n\nWoodroof (a gaunt Matthew McConaughey) is a Dallas electrician by day, cowboy when the rodeo is in town and a partier - whenever. His high-risk behaviors land him in the hospital where he is told he has HIV, and 30 days to live. Woodroof does his homework, but is unsuccessful at securing a steady supply of helpful medicines, until he travels to Mexico and brings back enough for him and a few dozen of his closest friends, provided those friends can pay. Woodroof becomes unlikely partners with Rayon (Jared Leto), a cross-dressing gay man, who helps bring him customers... and the Dallas Buyers Club is born.\n\nWoodruff copies a business model, of sorts, that he learns is being used in other cities, and begins selling \"memberships\". Members are entitled to a variety of drugs and medicines (some natural and some experimental) that are not available in the U.S., but procured from a growing list of locations all around the world. Woodruff gets help from a local doctor (Jennifer Garner) who gradually comes to understand that he really is helping people. Woodroof, however, is battling the local authorities, the medical establishment, the drug companies, and even his former friends, all of which perceive him as a threat, for various reasons. Meanwhile, he develops full-blown AIDS. Although he lives much longer than originally projected, he knows his days are numbered and he wants his life to mean something.\n\nThe strength of \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is its acting - mostly that from the two main characters. McConaughey and Leto both give earnest and heart-breaking, but somehow uplifting and definitely award-worthy performances. (Editor's note: Both men eventually received Screen Actors Guild Awards, Golden Globe Awards and Oscars for their work in this film.) Unfortunately, my enthusiasm for this film begins and ends with the acting. The story is interesting enough (not to mention important, yet little-known), but the movie drags, and it feels much longer than its 117 minutes. Its entertainment value, although bolstered by its talented leads, is still relatively low. \"B-\".",

Clearly McConaughey (himself a proud Texan) feels most inspired when placed in situations where traditional outlooks are forced into question and, after a lack luster early career, in maturity he have at last found his niche. \n\nThe real credit though goes to Jared Leto. His portrayal of a gender-bending transexual aids sufferer will no doubt be remembered as one of cinema's defining representations of the horror of the 1980s HIV epidemic. His degeneration from an irreverent, light-hearted harlequin into harrowing skeletal wreck is moving on multiple levels and is by far a career best in what has been a very impressive CV. \n\nJennifer Garner feels a little analogue compared to these larger-than-life characters but this proves advantageous since she manages to keep the film grounded firmly in reality when it could easily skyrocket into the realms of cliche. \n\nTo be honest, I had my doubts about Dallas Buyers Club before I saw it but I am glad I did. Admittedly, some of the middle scenes can be a little monotonous but if you can stick the film out until the end then it is most definitely worth the effort.",

The conditions, the things which these characters are going through, the way the people with HIV were treated those days are shown accurately in Dallas Buyers Club. Director, Jean-Marc Vallee and the writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallac crafted a very strong and relevant story.\nThis movie is one of the rare examples where the performances outshine the story. Matthew McCoughney and Jared Leto were tremendous! Both of them had to loose almost 40 pounds for their respective roles and that was not even the best thing about those characters, it's their acting and their dedication to portray their roles to perfection. Matthew changed his career completely past year with Mud, The Wolf of Wall Street and on top of everything Dallas Buyers Club. This is easily his best by far. \nJared Leto plays Rayon, a transvestite who is also facing the same complications as Ron. Leto and McCoughney are toe to toe with each other in terms of their performances. Their transformation into these characters is literally unrecognisable. They certainly deserved all the awards they have won so far and I will not be surprised if they win the Academy Awards too. One more notable character in this movie is Eve, played by Jennifer Garner. She does great as a supporting actor and is not overshadowed by the presence of Matthew and Jared on screen.\nThe feel of this movie is kind off dirty and dark which just perfectly reflects the situation in which the people suffering from HIV were during the 1980's. The dialogues are very cleverly written and its impact is enhanced by the perfect delivery of those brilliantly written dialogues by the actors.\nDallas Buyers Club is a brilliant movie and certainly among the top movies of 2013.

            "content": "\"The Dallas Buyers Club\" opens with a scene that doesn't mean much at first.  We are at a rodeo; bull and rider are let out of the pen.  The bull flails around in the ring while the rider holds on for dear life.  Elsewhere, overlooking the proceedings, are a man and a woman in shadow engaged in what can only be referred to as mercenary sex.  Later when that man is declared HIV positive it becomes clear that it is he, not the bull rider, who is really playing a dangerous game.\n\nThe man is Ron Woodroof, a real-life rodeo stud and electrician who was diagnosed in 1985 with HIV and, after a period of denial, engaged his skills as a hustler to extend his life seven years after being diagnosed with only 30 days to live.  How Ron got the disease is pretty easy to figure out.  He lives a life of excess that would have made Henry VIII blush.  He's not a nice guy.  He's a party animal with a cocaine habit, who guzzles booze and chases skirts with such ferocity that it almost seems exaggerated.  Like his buddies at the rodeo, Ron is a hard-headed homophobic, a misogynistic louse whose response to the news that he is HIV positive with \"I ain't no faggot.\"  He tells his doctor to shove it before storming out of the hospital.  Looking at his gaunt, skinny frame and pallid skin we are left to wonder why Ron didn't figure out something was wrong sooner.\n\nThe news that he is suffering from a \"gay disease\" hits him hard.  Newspapers have just announced the death of Rock Hudson and it pushes his fellow homophobes away.  Yet, he's not satisfied to lay down and die.  He begins doing research and tries to get his hands on AZT, the only FDA treatment available at the time.  Wading through a network of health officials whose only response is \"No . . . I'm really sorry,\" he determines to get some kind of help.  From here it is difficult to discuss important plot points without spoilers.  So, be warned.\n\nRon is spurred into action that not only extends his life but also helps a lot of other people in the process.  He discovers an American doctor in Mexico (a barely recognizable Griffin Dunne) who is willing to sell him the medication that he can then smuggle back across the border.  In an effort to skirt legal issues, he develops The Dallas Buyers Club, a club in which fellow AIDS patients pay him a $400 annual club fee and get their drugs for free.   He even makes friends with a pre-op transsexual named Rayon who has the disease himself and becomes Ron's connection into gay clients.  Ron's tepid friendship with Rayon doesn't crack his homophobia, but it pushes him into a mode of respect that never feels phony.  There is a mutual respect that develops that is touching even while it can't necessarily be called a friendship.\n\nRon's story is told through a brilliant performance by Matthew McConaughey, whose days as a rom-com himbo seem to be safely behind him after two years of wonderful work in \"Killer Joe\", \"Magic Mike\", and \"Mud\".  This is the single best performance of his career, a brave virtuoso piece of acting that reminds us why he became a movie star in the first place.  McConaughey lost 38 pounds to play this role and his appearance is striking.  We're use to the handsome, tanned actor with the Adonis-physique, but here he has shed all that.  Ron is rail-thin with sunken facial features and bad skin.  We're reminded of many of the young men who succumb to the disease early on - healthy men with youthful eyes staring out of a frame that was slowly withering away.  Yet, McConaughey's physical transformation is only part of what makes his performance work.  He isn't afraid to play Ron as a cantankerous jerk.  Our sympathy comes from his transformation from self-involved louse, to a man determined to help other AIDS patients who are being written off as \"the living dead.\"\n\nThe other great performance in the film comes from Jared Leto as Rayon, a sarcastic pre-op transsexual who becomes Ron's liaison to find gay patients for the club.  Rayon is gay but he's not over-the-top.  There's a sensitive heart beating beneath is transgender apparel and his approach to Ron is very touching.  The two man have a mutual need but it isn't in a formula way.  It is a form of respect that doesn't quite tip over into friendship.  Leto has always been an understated actor and here he turns in his finest performance.  He deserves and Oscar nomination next spring.\n\nYou only wish that the rest of the movie were so original.  The movie gets into the by-the-number elements of the plot and dispenses them often with underdeveloped characters and predictable drama.  Jennifer Garner has a criminally underwritten role as a doctor who is by Ron's side when he first gets the bad news but later comes to have sympathy with what he is trying to do.  The rest of the doctors come off as cold and unfeeling, usually approaching Ron with a lot of negatives.  So, you're left with two great performances in a movie whose script needed work.  That's okay because it's a flawed story led by an unflawed performance by Matthew McConaughey, one that signals that this wonderful actor is at the top of his form.",

Smuggling large quantities across the border, the duo establishes a unique patient structure in which other sufferers can join a 'club' which gains them access the supplies they need for a nominal monthly fee. \n\nInspired by real events, Dallas Buyers Club is a heart wrenching story that truly proves necessity is the mother of all invention. Director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e's first foray into artistic liberties drives the well-paced story in the right direction without falling into the trap of false sentimentality. \n\nIt is wonderful to see McConaughey's portrayal of Woodroof (who passed in 1992) finally bring the often underrated actor the accolades he genuinely deserves, including a golden globe win and an Oscar nomination; Leto not only matches his intensity pound for pound but also his honors in the supporting category, whilst Jennifer Garner as Dr. Eve Saks adds little to the stories layers.\n\nThe verdict: Like many movies released in the first quarter, this film is designed for industry recognition. With that said, it does make a lovely change for once, that a movie is actually worth the hype it receives. \n\nPublished : The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication : 24/01/2014",

The film, which revolves around the very serious topic of the AIDS outbreak in the mid-1980s and the surrounding controversy with pharmaceutical companies and investigational drugs to treat the disease. What 'Buyers' does particularly well is it looks at the crisis through the eyes of an unlikely participant who becomes a lightning rod thanks to his creative way of getting patients access to potentially life-saving therapies.\n\nAs a film, 'Buyers' rarely causes the audience to lose interest. A large part of this is due to the standout acting performances from McConaughey (the aforementioned Ron Woodroof), Jared Leto (as a transsexual AIDS patient who befriends Woodroof) and Jennifer Garner (as a morals-driven clinician). Throughout the film, there are plenty of scenes that are as dramatic as they are sincere. Seeing Woodroof undergo a major change in character over the duration of 'Buyers' is definitely interesting, and well done. In terms of the filmography, there is some unique camerawork here, and the film editing actually stands out in a good way. Additionally, the dialogue serves as an important tool in the film, as the colloquial characteristics of southern-speak adds more flavor to everything. \n\n'Dallas Buyers Club' is a story of tragedy and triumph, and the acting performances - which earned a few academy awards - are alone worth a watch.",

            "content": "Included In Lists:\nStrong Performances - Matthew McConaughey\n\nSay what you will about Matthew McConaughey, but he has undoubtedly broken out of the seemingly doomed shell that he has created for himself during the turn of the century, trapped within the expectations of the system through weightless romantic leads that neither challenges nor rewards him. Beginning with The Lincoln Lawyer in 2011, McConaughey have turned his career around, a shining beacon of hope that reveal the possibility of a worthy career, climbing out of the pitfall successfully through a applaud-worthy string of features that raised him above his peers in a matter of only five years; potentially the defining actor of the decade.\n\nDallas Buyers Club was the catalyst for his new found fame and respect, a feature that demonstrated his commitment and capabilities as an actor, profiting from his sacrifice and effort during the awards circle; taking home the prestigious Best Actor award along with his co-star Jared Leto for Best Supporting Actor. From what I have seen from the actor, this is without a doubt his strongest film yet, taking on a role that is both demanding in its complexity, with every element of the production acting as a support for this commanding performance, and with that intense amount of pressure, he was fortunately able to carry beyond the demands of his position, thus rewarding many in the process.\n\nThe premise itself is fascinating enough for anybody to enter into the film with confidence, exploring the difficulties that came with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, tackling the event from a personal level, led by Ron Woodrood (McConaughey) as a victim and survivor. Given the calamity of the disease, the film could have observed the issue from a bird's eye view, distancing from the individual figures and take on the issue through statistics and historical facts; an approach that a safe filmmaker would take in order to capture more information and hoping to appeal to a larger audience. Although, in doing so, it would have taken away the film's strength which displays the morally damaging stigma that carried with the disease, and the physical deterioration that an individual would suffer when stricken; which are critical elements in determining an actor's performance, the stimuli that would provide them the challenge they require to dissolve themselves within the roles.\n\nRon Woodrood and his eventual business partner, Rayon (Jared Leto), allow themselves to become symbols of hope, especially to those who felt helpless by their diagnosis; not only were they a victim to a physical disease, but also of political and social injustice through the suspicious processes of the FDA, approving a drug that causes fatal adverse effects when administered with their recommended dosage. This drug, AZT, and those who persist in its maintaining its trial on its subjects have taken on the role of antagonists through the perspective of our protagonist. Woodrood and Rayon's experience with the treatment becomes the stimulating agent for our sense of distrust towards the FDA; but director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e and his writers refuses to expose the corruption that may run beneath its presence, it provides a sense of ambiguity and honesty to its depiction, highlighting the fact that possibly its 'antagonistic' members are simply following procedure.\n\nWoodrood and Rayon are heroes for their actions, the smuggling of experimental drugs from international researchers, placing hope in the tortured victims of Dallas, Texas. They are shining figures from the position they stand, but intelligently, they remain pure in their representation due to the inherent flaws they already carry since their introduction; they don't easily earn their redemption, and allows changes to be implanted in appropriate and precise doses, thus earning themselves by the time they reach their conclusions, remaining with us beyond the film's condensed tale.\n\nIf there was drawback to be found, it would be in the individual moments that intends to bait on its audience too evidently of the performances of its actors, a self-awareness that hopes to push them in the awards circle; Oscar bait is the term, but thankfully the film doesn't suffer from it as painfully like others, thus securing its place when the time finally came for prestigious honours to be bestowed. The film kept its sights on the two male performers that Jennifer Garner's role as the conflicted Eve becomes shifted far too widely, solidifying her presence only through moments of plot progression rather than earned emotion and complex characterisation; although the increase of her screen time could however affect the intensity that was provided in the other two performances.\n\nMarvellous and captivating the film certainly is, with Matthew McConaughey at the pinnacle of his talent, providing a performance that is defining of his recent transformation; which I am sure could be surpassed in an upcoming role that would demand more of him, but even if that isn't the case, he has left an incredible mark on cinematic history that would no doubt act as an inspiration for the descendants that would later enter into the platform.",

Dallas Buyers Club is based on a true story of Ron Woodroof who has been seeking a drug to cure AIDS being infected he himself with the illness. It was good drama movie about life and friendship but the most important of all is the stigma of being an AIDS/HIV infected person. Actually this movie is quite moving that it raises awareness on AIDS and HIV and how people infected with it deals with as an everyday struggle of their lives. The movie does not only shares the drama of being an AIDS/HIV infected person but the drama behind on how to live their daily life in facing the illness that has no cure until now and the trauma of knowing that you'll die on a certain time. This movie also has a nice story about friendship and life challenges that boost one's morale and confidence. Matthew McConaughey was phenomenal in acting in this movie! Jared Leto as transgender Rayon is so memorable and remarkable! Both got a 2014 Oscar awards for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. Jennifer Garner played Dr. Eve Saks gave a decent act but she her character limited to supporting cast only that's why her shining moment to act is limited only. Dallas Buyers Club is an inspiring movie about acceptance, human spirit and resilience. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "When Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) is declared to be HIV positive, he admits himself in the hospital's experimental unit for the testing of a new medicine for the treatment of AIDS. With only a month to live, he decides to neglect the care given by Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner) and instead travels to Mexico to treat himself with illegal medicines. Impressed and unquestioning the effectiveness of these drugs (which are not approved by the FDA), Ron decides to smuggle these drugs and sell them to others being treated for AIDS in a circle named The Dallas Buyers Club; with a simple rule: pay $400 every month and get the drugs for your treatment.\n\nDirected by Jean-Marc Vallee, this biographical film follows the struggle of Ron to come in terms with being diagnosed with AIDS in a society based in the year 1985 where AIDS was a resulting produce of homosexuals and their cheap existence. Through this sudden kick in the teeth Ron learns to value homosexuals through his friend Rayon (Jared Leto) and embraces their worth.\n\nThough this film has a poignant and distressing script, the character of Ron portrayed by Matthew McConaughey doesn't really allow the audience to drown with tears of sympathy, rather it restores some hope of life and living. The looks of each spirit was brought on screen so authentically; hats off to McConaughey for validating his look by losing so much weight. Even the hair (Kat Percy) and make up (Melanie Deforrest) artists proved their credibility by merging the actors to their characters.\n\nJared Leto deserves a special applause and mention for his incredible and audacious performance of playing a homosexual so persuasively. He truly deserved his win at the Oscars for the Best Supporting Actor and is definitely someone to look out for. Jennifer Garner too did her best to contribute to this film.\n\nThe background score by Yves Belanger and editing by Martin Pensa and Jean-Marc Vallee was just incredible and comprehended every unit of this film with utmost ovation. \n\n\nWinning Oscars was just a small summation of this film's credibility. This film has the ability to make you empathize rather than sympathize!",

Or so it seems to Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), a hard drinking cowboy with a penchant for anonymous sex, hard drugs, and bull riding. When he has an accident at work and is sent to the hospital, he discovers the real price for his hedonistic lifestyle-he has HIV, and he only has thirty days to live.\n\nRon researches his condition. He discovers, to his amazement, that not just the \"Tinkerbells\" can contract HIV. He also finds that there is a drug available for testing that may help, but it is not for sale. Soon he embarks upon a journey that will take him through the most dangerous circles of black market prescription drugs and will reveal the seamy relationship between corporations and government, but it is also an adventure that will change his outlook on the disease itself and its sufferers.\n\nIn Ron Woodroof, we have the least sympathetic of protagonists. A homophobe, a womanizer, an alcoholic, an abusive little man with scant thought for how to do anything with his life other than get laid and get high. And somehow, director Jean-Marc Vallee and company have made a movie that not only causes us to slowly come to cheer him on, but somehow does not let us forget what he truly is on the inside. To give us reasons to not forget his sins but, in remembering them, exult in his cause is a hard task to perform. The viewer is at once repulsed by him and, by stages, sympathetic with his plight and his changes in character.\n\nTo be sure, the movie is a tad unevenly biased. There is not one unsympathetic homosexual character, while any character who does not instantly scream by their presence \"I AM ON YOUR SIDE\" is played off as barely human. But that is minute compared to what the movie does right. Yes, the film has an agenda, and it announces itself with a bullhorn, but at least there is a clear direction and a \"Dramatis Personae\" that carries it off without being belaboring and insulting.\n\n\"The Dallas Buyers Club\" is a strange item. Challenged by being based on a true story, but having to follow scripting conventions. Having a larger purpose, but falling victim to certain movie clich\u00e9s. An odd marketing campaign that has no trust in the material itself, but rather plays the film off as a lark. Ignoring all of this, it is nearly impossible to not see the work at its heart. \"The Dallas Buyers Club\" is a modern day \"Philadelphia.\" Though it does not have as much of an emotional punch as \"Philadelphia,\" it manages to stand on its own merits as though that movie never even existed. Here is a film that tackles far more than a discussion about HIV and AIDS and moves on into corporate lobbying, the corruption of money on politics, and the human element that tends to get lost in the political and judicial process. Those involved in this enterprise should be proud of the work they have done.",

            "content": "\"LIVES TO THE FULLEST\"\n\nThis year has given us some important films, but none have achieved the grandness that is Dallas Buyers Club.  This exceptional film tore me to pieces over and over and when I thought it was done, it wasn't, and it hit me again and again.  There is something just truly special about the movie.  The dedication from the cast and crew to bring this story to life shines through in every scene.  This poignant tale resonates throughout and it fits nicely near the top of my picks for the best movie of the year, and clenches best actor and best supporting actor of the year with ease. \n\nI have to jump right in and talk about Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto; the years two finest acting achievements by far.  In order to realistically portray their dying characters the two starved themselves down to near nothing.  It was hard to watch to be honest.  Their commitment to telling this story is admirable and inspiring.  McConaughey, who's been exploring far more diverse rolls in the last couple years, has made what could possibly be a career best in my opinion.  Same goes for Leto who already has an impressive body-altering career behind him (Requiem For A Dream, Chapter 27) but goes way beyond for this one.  Watching them on screen was like watching someone die right in front of you.  Thankfully tho, the makers had enough respect for these men to not focus on it, but rather let you understand without beating you over the head.  Honor our heroes for their actions, do not exploit their handicaps.  Dallas Buyers Club honored these true life heroes with great respect and I personally thank them deeply for that.  \n\nYou can have a great cast, but if they don't have the backdrops to act against it can be a waste.  Thankfully the crew who worked on Dallas Buyers Club obviously knew this and recreated the time period beautifully.  The wonderment of the 80's feels somewhat toned down here, as if matching the mood of the film.  I loved it.  It made for textured experience back in time with simple yet effective style.  Everything from the hair, to the clothes, to the bedspreads was handled with such care - and not just Texas but several locations around the world.  The muted color pallet added to the overall sense of life slipping away, fading into black.  The beautiful symbolism helped tell the story subconsciously and added weight to every scene.  It was a delightful touch.\n\nThis incredible movie does a great job exposing ugly truths, sad realities, and the corruption all around us.  This one man took a stand and did everything in his power (legally, or not so much) to extend his own life, and the lives of others effected by HIV and AIDS.  I did not know of buyers clubs before this movie and the sheer fact they were able to exist at all was a miracle.  After the movie, when I had stopped crying, I was walking to my car and had a moment of guilt come over me.  I was born in 86, I missed the AIDS epidemic of the 80's thankfully, but to know I can live the way I do now because of so much suffering is kinda hard to accept.  So many people died then who nowadays could have been saved.  I am grateful that the work of the buyers clubs inspired doctors to pursue alternate means of treatment and create the modern cocktails but it was disturbing to see the infected treated with such disdain and disregard.  It's uplifting now to see how far we've come in our understanding of the virus and the people effected by it.  \n\nThis movie will not soon fade from my conscious and I hope many more people will find their way to it.  My eyes were red from the constant tears, but my heart was filled with hope knowing there are people out there who care about others and aren't afraid to fight.  Dallas Buyers Club is a triumph and it will serve as a history lesson for many younger generations.  Everyone involved deserves great credit for the work they did to bring this movie to life and allow us to experience the suffering, the stamina, and the passion of a few good people who refused to accept death and fought with every last breath to the very end.\n\nFINAL SCORE = 5/5 Bear Paws\n\nWest Fisher\n\nMovieBears.com, Las Vegas\n\nNevada Film Critics Society\n\nThe International Academy of Film & Television\n\nwest@moviebears.com",

You wouldn't know it from the movie, but the FDA worked compassionately with the HIV community in the first decade, bending the rules by allowing buyers clubs to exist and giving otherwise terminally ill people a chance to fight nearly however they wanted (there were no government raids that the movie depicts) while the health industry worked to figure out a treatment with proper science.  The movie also doesn't reveal that the Dallas club was considered too experimental by some of the other eight clubs; any whiff from around the world of a chemical with a possible positive effect and it would be made accessible by Ron Woodroof, who offered 130 different drugs unapproved by the FDA. Sadly, the film places ill motivations on behalf of the government and healthcare community in regards to the lack of treatment options. But rather than malice, we were dealing with ignorance. This was a brand new disease with about a 100% death rate, and both the FDA and doctors were rushing to treat the infected with any potential treatments they responsibly could. The problem for all involved boils down to a lack of data and the wide variations of analysis of what little data there was.",

In 15 minutes he almost steals the show off Leo in Wolf Of Wall Street and in Interstellar he proves to us he has leading man written all over him. Here he's just gone Christian Bale on our ass and the outcome is excellent to say the least. Homophobic Texan Ron Woodroof is a rock and roll, rodeo shit head, that cares only about banging chicks and hitting the booze, with a good old bit of rodeo inbetween. After passing out one day, he soon finds himself in serious trouble, when he is diagnosed with HIV and the AIDS virus. He is promised 30 days to live and goes on the hunt for a cure. This leads him to finding a more naturalistic way of fighting off the disease but leaves his fighting a more corrupt nemesis, the FDA. Its strong Oscar winning stuff really from the get go. It's an encapsulating drama that grips and pulls out most of the right punches, but its not entirely new and were it not for the 3 lead actors handing out gold, this film wouldnt stand up to the hype. As mentioned Matthew is on his A game, dropping stones to achieve his look, it works, the flux of weight and colour of his skin add to the sheer agony we feel for him as a character, even if he starts out as someone pretty detestable. Jared Leto, now where the fuck did that performance come from? In fact if your not on the ball, you wouldnt even notice it was him. This is the best I have ever seen him, he too sheds the pounds and fires out a pungent performance and a transexual AIDS victim. He is completely on another planet here and from now on, my eyes will be firmly peeled to his follow up performances. Hilary Swank also turns in a strong but by no means ground breaking performance, however she is the rock that allows the other 2, to go to town. The look and feel of the film is top notch and its grittiness, visually, is compelling enough, but its nothing fresh. Although the story is based on true events and the movie hits the right notes, it still feels extremely hungry for notoriety. It has Academy Awards written all over it and no, thats not a bad thing as such, but these films to me, drop the ball a little, they become more about appeasing the masses than the source material. A power house of performances, carries an average film and it definately is worth your time.",

The writing was okay and the plot was mostly decided for the director from the actual life of Ron Woodruff, but it was the acting that made Dallas Buyer's Club so great.",

The film explores the harsh realities of the AIDS epidemic in the 80s, and does it by showing this one guy, a homophobe and racist from Texas who contracts HIV, and ends up helping a lot of people by setting up a \"Buyer's Club\" in which people pay $400 a month and get all the drugs...or vitamins that they want. It really is a movie carried by the top notch performances of McConaughey and Leto, and it is worth seeing for just that.",

In my personal opinion this is the best film Mathew McConaughey has ever made. It is evident that he puts all his emotion and heart into making his character real allowing the audience to connect with him on a personal and emotional level. I feel that because of McConaughey's Dallas origins he was an ideal casting for the role of Ron. This film has a great story line that flows with all the emotional ups and downs needed to grip and draw an audience into the story. I really liked the fact that it is based on a true story that highlighted a lot of the homophobic and single mindedness of not only people but medical professionals during that era. I would highly recommend this film to anyone and I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",

But as it hits the meat of the plot, Woodroof's character development seems to take a back-seat to some melodrama and a historical drama that really feels like an adaptation of a pop nonfiction book. He has not so much an arc as a complete about-face, and most of the movie barely seems to remember the man Woodroof once was. It certainly maintains a greater sense of cinematic artistry and high caliber character acting than 95% of its ilk, but it still of feels somewhat hobbled by self-consciousness of the gravity and emotion of its subject matter.",

            "content": "Back when I was a young lad about 12 years old I remember staying up late one night to watch something on TV, during one of the ad breaks the most disturbing thing I had ever seen in my young life came across the screen. It was the late 80's and the ad featured a group of what looked to be everyday normal people being lowered into a bowling lane as pins, at the other end a tall dark cloaked figure holding a sickle in one hand and a bowling ball in the other, the Grim Reaper figure bowled the ball down the lane and as the ball advanced towards a young girl she stood crying before being bowled over and then pushed aside as a new set of pins was brought down. The standout memory for me from that ad was the mother holding her baby and the way the baby flew out of her arms and hit the ground as she was picked off as a spare. The first time I seen this ad it shocked me so much I burst into tears and had to have my mum explain to me what it was all about. I had never heard of AIDS or the virus it was associated with but because of that ad to this day it still terrifies me.\nDallas Buyers Club has been acclaimed worldwide as a masterful piece of storytelling, telling the story of a man and his life struggle when he learns that he has caught the AIDS virus in the late 80's. Ron Woodroof has been given 30 days to live his goal now is to make those days last as long as possible. The film is based loosely around Ron Woodroofs last years and his struggle against the FDA and the drugs available so he can live. Ron finds out that there are drugs in other parts of the world outside of Texas that are not legal in the USA so he does what he has to, to bring those drugs into the country so he can not only save his own life but the lives of hundreds of other people as well. Ron starts a \"buyers' club\" where people pay $400 per month and get given all the drugs they need to help them extend their lives. He meets Rayon a transvestite who he agrees to partner his Buyers Club with and together the duo do exactly what they have set out to do selling alternative medicines to those who really need it all the while dodging the FDA and their laws that have been made to stop him.\nMatthew McConaughey (The Wolf of Wall street, Magic Mike) stars in Dallas Buyers Club as Ron Woodroof, a rodeo cowboy electrician, the character he portrays on screen is phenomenal, the actor actual lost 21 kilos to play this role and it really does show. On screen Matthew looked shocking, the character he played was a sexist homophonic racist man, not a single care in the world but for himself and his sex drug filled lifestyle. It's not until later in the film where he meets Rayon a transvestite AIDS patient that Ron starts to see the virus for what it really is. Rayon and Ron become business partners and best friends as much as possible. Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream, 30 secs to Mars) plays Rayon, I found his portrayal to be a little stereotypical though, his walk, the way he talked and moved, don't get me wrong he was great but it did seem very forced and over the top to me. Perhaps that's my own personal prejudices getting in the way there, I can't really say. Once again though I will say he was very good in his role. Jennifer Gardner (Alias, Electra) plays Dr Eve Sacks, one of the Dr's in the hospital who is in charge of the testing of the AZT drug, the new medical cure for AIDS, she was also very brilliant in her role.\nIt is a very heavy film, a heavy topic that most people still find uncomfortable to deal with including myself. It's not meant to put fear into you as the Grim reaper ad did but it does make you think especially if you have known people who have passed or who are currently living with the virus. I found the story and the way it was told to be slow in places, having a movie based on real life though can't be all excitement all the time. Personally I didn't fall into the story, I didn't feel the emotion that I have heard thousands of other viewers felt whilst watching. I found the story harsh and troubling but not enough to move me as it set out to do. It was portrayed exceptional well by all involved it's just not my cup of tea so to speak.\nDallas Buyers Club gets 3 out 5 BanShee Screams\nThanks for reading.\nX\n#dallasbuyersclub",

While Mud is ranked higher and McConaughey's performance is just as good in that movie, Dallas Buyers Club has the story and emotional connection to match, offering a powerful and mostly true tale of humanity in a time of dehumanization and misunderstanding.

I've never seen mcconaughey perform like that before and Leto I didn't even realize was in this movie until I read it later-he pulled his character off very well. Both actors were awesome and breathtakingly convincing. At first I didn't like the film and was like oh the main character is a womanizing foul-mouthed homophobe redneck who I've met before and seen before in movies. Then the movie quickly changes tune and wow u see this inconsiderate person become a hero. He lived a hard life and fell hard too. Sometimes it takes something awful to happen to make u a better person. What I really enjoyed was seeing how the Main character became less judge mental and also a fighter/hustler for his own survival and others. I liked how it showed how prejudice and mean ppl can be to diseases and the lgbt community. I also liked Leto story and seeing his internal and familial struggles with being transgender. The movie is heart-wrenching and moves quickly completely engaging the audience. I thoroughly enjoyed some of the humor btw the odd coupling of Leto character and mcconaughey as well as some of the script for Ron who spit it like he saw it. The only problem I had with this film is I think it took some liberties in showing the fda and azt as terrible for dramatic purposes-the man is one of the first to have AIDS it's dramatic Enuff! They show the fda as this terrible profit monster which I think was a bit from the truth bc if u read about this it says they worked with the clubs and only got involved after hearing about some of the bad side effects of his drugs causing deaths. Also they act as tho azt is poison which it isn't and actually is effective in lower doses for aids and has saved millions of lives. Some of the problem was that the disease was so new and killed so quickly then with the fda.",

I wasn't a big fan of this film, just McConaughey's performance. He absolutely nails the role, making us forget what he's been doing the last few years. Unfortunately, he's really the only one who gives it his all. Jennifer Garner appears to be sleepwalking through her part, and Jared Leto seemed to be channeling his inner Johnny Depp to deliver a performance that seemed more shock value than anything. The film moves briskly and it doesn't hit most of the familiar trappings that true event films usually do. Overall, it isn't a bad film, just not a good one.",

That's the biggest thing I took from this film, and the Academy recognized that too when giving him the Best Actor award.  Great performances don't make a great film.  They certainly help, and while Dallas Buyers Club is very good . . . it never quite made it to next plateau.\n\nHIV and AIDS is scary business and even more so in the 80s when people didn't know what the hell was going on.  The politics of having to test medicines out and finally get them approved by the FDA left a lot of sick people standing around with their respective dicks in their hands.  That's where Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) steps into the picture.  After the news that the man has contracted HIV, most likely due to his habitual drug use, he eventually does his homework and pursues an alternate means of treatment.  What he discovers are drugs that, while not approved by the FDA, seem to do a body good.  At least, better than the large doses of ATZ that's still in clinical trials.  Meeting up with someone to put a friendly face on his business, Woodroof befriends Rayon (Jared Leto) and the two create the Dallas Buyers Club.  To legally keep doing what he can to provide drugs to other AIDS patients, a membership is paid for, but never any drugs.\n\nThis is the jist of the flick.  It's engaging, never boring and delivers some great performances by the two leads.  As previously mentioned, McConaughey transforms himself.  Pulling a 'Machinist', he loses about 40 pounds for the role to accurately portray a man in his condition.  There are moments where you won't even believe what you're looking at.  More importantly, while Woodroof's reasons are selfish a lot of the time, you still care for him.  Chalk this up to charisma of Mr. McConaughey, who's been killing it with roles in films like Mud, True Detective and The Wolf of Wall Street lately.  Leto is more than adequate as well, although I'd say given the events that unfold, I felt a lot less for him than I thought I should.\n\nThis is not necessarily an entertaining film.  It's well-done but paints a bleak picture of what some groups of people unfortunately had to go through.  That's not what holds it back from greatness for me though.  And don't get me wrong, I'm not a stickler for accurate details with my 'based on a true story' flicks.  No, instead I found myself being more removed from the plight of our Dallas Buyers Club and its members as the film went on.  The third act, while understandably inevitable, feels more like a car that runs out of gas rather than one that reaches its destination.  Almost as if the filmmakers said everything they wanted to say with the first two acts and just decided to show us more of the same for its final third.\n\nThat doesn't mean this film doesn't make you feel for those in need, and upset that there isn't a better way to treat them.  In the end, I think that's the most important part.",

That would be a good and potentially provocative movie (to some audiences). However, we need to consider the movie made instead wherein a homophobic and redneck straight man becomes an angel of sorts for those suffering from HIV/AIDS by investigating and then illegally importing experimental drugs that the FDA was slow in approving.  That man (the real life Ron Woodroof) is played by Matthew McConaughey, transformed by a 50 pound weight loss into a gaunt sick man.  Jared Leto plays his transgender business partner.  As you know, both won Oscars. If there can be a feel-good movie about AIDS, then perhaps this is it.  Shot on an extremely low budget, it doesn't show and instead manages to maintain a spirited vibrancy, sense of humour, and righteousness, even though it isn't the movie not made.",

            "content": "It was not till 1994 when Jonathan Demme's 'Philadelphia' (1994) was released being the first mainstream, gay related movie. It was a huge break, which created a small loop for a gay community to go through. Giving an Oscar to Tom Hanks was also significant - not only because it was his first Academy Award, but also because honoring the role of dying of AIDS homosexual meant recognition.  This recognition became a very important message in cinematography, raising the problem of gays.\n\nIt took another 11 years to start the discussion about tolerance, limits, what can and cannot be allowed in the mainstream movie. 'Brokeback Mountain' (2005) definitely broke another taboos and homosexual audience could feel like 'one of the boys'. The movie is a story about relationship between two cowboys - Ennis and Jack. Suppressed by society decided to hide their love and for over a decade make up excused for their friends and families. Significantly stronger and more shocking than 'Philadelphia', 'Brokeback Mountain' rose a lot of conversations, questions and, in my opinion, misunderstandings. Despite strong, sexual scenes (never seen by a mainstream cinema viewer before) the movie is nothing else but beautiful story about true love, determination and sacrifice one has to make in life.\n\n 'Brokeback Mountain' was a real breeze of hope for gay community still waiting for their milestone in the mainstream cinema. Members of the Academy proved that they are aware of the changes, of society's needs and demands. Unfortunately, after a boom and discussions created by the movie, a 'gay theme' was, yet again, pushed to the side and forgotten. Couple of low budget or off movies that described or at least touched the issues of homosexuality were released, but the broad audience never saw them.\n\nAs much as I was looking forward to 'Dallas Buyers Club' (2013) I was not really prepared for what it had to offer. Known from romantic comedies Matthew McConaughey was never a sign of a top shelf cinema. However, by changing the type of characters he used to play and going in the other direction actor proved me wrong - by keeping his shirt on and managing to develop a truly real and deep character. Ron is a rodeo loving, coke abusing, 'lady' lover. He lives fast and does not care about the future. Presented in the dark and dodgy scenarios, the protagonist takes us to his world. Watching him living in denial and refusing to accept his disease, I could not stop it wonder if he is just a product of an environment he is in - full of testosterone and 'male man' Texas, or a reflection of it.\n\nRon lives in is a simple, lower class existence where beer with friends after work is a must, a 100$ hooker is a treat and everyone lives from paycheck to paycheck. It is also very limited, closed and intolerant place. Known for being extremely conservative and religious Texas appears to be the worst place for AIDS affected man. Rejected by people he was surrounded with and not understood by society, Ron becomes angry and lonely in his misery. Mad at the disease he does not understand and people he became associated with (gays, of course) Ron is very close to shake his hand with death.\n\nBy using tools seen usually in a low budget cinema, Valle created an atmosphere of roughness, which seems to depict and personalize AIDS and its destructive effects. Presented as a reflection of gay life, unprotected sex and drug abuse the disease is something no one wants to deal with. A dirty room in a small community apartment, a couple of cheap hookers, bars you would never enter without a couple of shots.\n\nThinking about what the director shown in 'Dallas Buyers Club', comparing the movie to Demme's 'Philadelphia' seems to be the right thing to do. Very safe and (so not to say 'childish') attitude towards gays and gay community was the reflection viewers had after watching Hanks and Banderas, who tried to convince us how gay  they are, staying, at the same time, very politically correct and cautious. It was the first movie speaking openly about gays, AIDS and death. Awarded by Oscars, honored by critics and seen by millions. However, after watching 'Philadelphia' the only reflection I had was: 'If you are gay you are going to die'. It does not matter who you are, what you do and where you come from. You can be a great lawyer, have a lot of friends, be respected and have a supporting and loving family. It all does not matter because as long as you are gay, you are going to die. This beautiful story was supposed to warn viewers instead of being a lesson of tolerance. After making 'Silence of the Lambs' (1991) Jonathan Demme decided to shoot 'Philadelphia' and shake the accusations of being anti-gay off his shoulders. Well, it did not really work.\n\n'Dallas Buyers Club' is different. It is dark, it is gloomy, it sends us to the lowest of human existence - it is real. Despite of its significant meaning 'Philadelphia' will never be a 'real' movie. It seems more of a created story used to show something different - unfortunately, instead of presenting the truth Demme decided to stay safe, to not cross the line, to be 'cute'.  No homosexual relations are shown in the film (We know that Hanks and Banderas are partners aka 'lovers' because they call each other 'honey'),  Denzel Washington plays the lawyer (he plays a 'black guy' so political correctness is sustained, plus the works pro bono) and the whole case seems to be very easy, scripted. There is no fight, there is no struggle\n- Andy has a family who supports him, who loves him, he has a boyfriend who runs to the hospital and is concerned about his health. You should have had shown a little bit more suffering and roughness, Mr. Demme.\n\nGays seem to be in a constant fight - with themselves, society lack of tolerance or simply with the law. Like women, gays have to fight for their rights. Being misunderstood, rejected and pushed to society's margin, being considered 'dirty and diseased' - homosexuals push away accusations, answer questions and hide. Looking at the movies mainstream cinema offers, one can observe that gay life isn't easy. However, I am glad that visible and significant changes are being made, changes are seen and opinions are shared.  Fighting or not, the boys are doing fabulous job. Keep it up.",

Garner was pretty good, and Leto was okay (not Oscar-caliber at all, not even close), and honestly, McConaughey was terrible.

Little is known about the disease, littler known is its treatment, and its latest victim is Ron Woodroof - a blue collar, hustler and straight-up Texas cowboy and he going out swinging hard, creating the Dallas Buyers Club.\n\nAt a time when HIV was poorly understood and research to treat the virus was slow moving, in part by the FDA, diagnosis was a death sentence. With a startlingly low 30 day prognosis, Woodroof is just bullheaded enough attempt to outlive his prognosis, by any means necessary despite the legal ramifications. Based on a true story, Dallas Buyers Clubs tells of Woodroof's quest for medication, bypassing regulation, by heading straight to Mexico. Along the way he sees a booming market of desperate people, and creates a members-only club with an unlikely business partner Rayon, a trans woman.\n\nMatthew McConaughey plays the machismo Ron Woodroof and his casting could not be more on point. Who else can play a Texas cowboy than Hollywood's own leading man? His commitment to the character is obvious due to his physical transformation and withered frame of a deathly ill man.  The role was made for him and that might be the problem - it feels like he is just being Matthew McConaughey with AIDS.\n\nThe real star of the film is the trans business partner Rayon. Jared Leto is pure and true in his portrayal of the trans Rayon, albeit a bit hokey. He is transcendent, there is absolutely not a drop of Leto visible, not for even a fraction of a second. Once Leto's character is introduced the movie takes a powerful step in the direction of captivating Oscar worthy cinema.\n\nIn less capable hands this story could have easily been sappy, bland, and straight-forward. Its lack of insipidity is thanks in part to the relatively unknown script writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack. and director of the film Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e. In the end it is a human interest piece masked as a drama and worthy of your time and viewership.",

I am highly ambivalent about this film.  McConaughey is terrific in his role, and the atmosphere of mid-80s AIDS hysteria is well conveyed.  The story line is hard to follow, because the (extensive) legal wrangling is improperly explained; such exposition is too much like hard work, so the film banks on the popular assumption that science and the 'Establishment' are evil and in league with each other to allow it to gloss over the real meaning of these events.  Instead, the film reserves most attention for the emotionally richer subplot exploring the odd-couple relationship between the frankly loathsome Woodroof and a similarly afflicted gay man.  On the whole I found it an unconvincing, lazy and incompetently narrated spin job on one of the many desperate people who, facing untimely death and grasping at straws in the absence of proved anti-virals, sought to take charge of their bodies for themselves.  It was desperate, but it was not heroic.  AZT, in lower doses than those prescribed in initial trials, proved highly effective.",

In 1985, he is well into an unexamined existence with a devil-may-care lifestyle including drugs, alcohol and sexual encounters with prostitutes. Suddenly, Ron is blindsided by being diagnosed as H.I.V.-positive and given 30 days to live. Yet he will not, and does not, accept a death sentence. His crash course of research reveals a lack of approved treatments and medications in the U.S., so Ron crosses the border into Mexico. There, he learns about alternative treatments and begins smuggling them into the U.S., challenging the medical and scientific community including his concerned physician, Dr. Eve Saks (Jennifer Garner). An outsider to the gay community, Ron finds an unlikely ally in fellow AIDS patient Rayon (Jared Leto), a transsexual who shares Ron's lust for life. Rayon also shares Ron's entrepreneurial spirit: seeking to avoid government sanctions against selling non-approved medicines and supplements, they establish a \"buyers club,\" where H.I.V.-positive people pay monthly dues for access to the newly acquired supplies. Deep in the heart of Texas, Ron's pioneering underground collective beats loud and strong. With a growing community of friends and clients, Ron fights for dignity, education, and acceptance. In the years following his diagnosis, Ron lives life to the fullest like never before...\n\nReal life \"based on a true story\" movies means often these days a movie where the actors go so deep into character that one can wonder how they can get out of character. \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is for sure one of those movies. The result in this case were Oscar wins for Best actor (McConaughey) and Best supporting actor (Leto) and well deserved as well. McConaughey has managed to make a shitpile of movies the past years, but then sparked in movies such as \"The Paperboy\" and here he shows his full register, as in \"True Detective\". His desperate Woodroof is a superb performance no one can take away from him. The same goes for Jared Leto. So the criticism has been that a real transgender person should\u00b4ve played Rayon, but I can\u00b4t see the point in that when Leto has managed to transform himself in such a believable manner and portrays Rayon with so many emotional layers and keep a good balance to McConaughey\u00b4s Woodroof. Yes, I always wonder how much is the truth and how much is Hollywood in these sort of movies. What was the real truth? \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is nevertheless a moving story about a man who will not yield in front of the fact that he has been handed a death sentence.",

All of his efforts reflects in his performance to win Oscar for the Best Actor.

The performances from Leto, McConaughey, and even Jennifer Garner in a strong but touching performance as a doctor, will get to you and make one more aware of these serious topics. Rating: 83",

However this is a film made special by its sense of defiance and scabrous humour. Ron and Rayon simply don't accept their role as victims.\n\nMcConaughey has always been underestimated as an actor, I may have mentioned it a 1,000 times! Here, he gives an astonishing performance that combines sleaziness and venality; with dignity and pathos.\n\nRon and his business partner, the HIV-positive Rayon make a memorable odd couple. One a macho redneck and the other a Marc Bolan-obsessed transgender woman. Leto is just as superb as a character self-reliant but intensely vulnerable. Their handshake/hug is incredibly moving.\n\nThe tone is just right throughout. The film doesn't trivialise the plight of the HIV+ protagonists in pursuit of easy laughs. Nor does it go for mawkishness or heavy-handed solemnity. In many ways this is like The Wire, a story about American entrepreneurialism. Ron and Rayon are hustlers responding to market forces.\n\nThis captures the 80 paranoia perfectly, and is still thoroughly uplifting to watch. A great tale of the underdogs fighting back against the odds.",

Having being rejected by his friends and co-workers for having the \"queer person's\" disease, he decides to combat this illness to prolong his life. Being that this disease is relatively new, the drug that the FDA has approves doesn't quite work for him. He decides to go through every measure he can find, legally and illegally in his country and outside of it to find the medications that are not FDA approved. Getting help from the most unlikeliest alliances, Rayon (Jay Leto) and  Dr. Eve Sachs (Jennifer Garner) he launches the \"Dallas Buyers Club\", which works wonders...and prolongs his life longer than the doctor's prognosis. You feel his angst, struggles, and frustrations to be successful. Truly a wonderful movie to experience. Please see this, human interest drama.",

Gardner is just...ok as the doctor lady friend, but I feel they could have cast someone else and cut the budget lower or just made it somehow more fleshed out.  There are just a lot of weird \"Oscar-isms\" here like why everyone is a drug addict, how he gets all the medical knowledge (Limitless?), the \"Jennifer Lawrence school of yelling at authority\" for an Oscar scene, how his strength changes for the scene he needs it, how his money changes for the scenes he needs it.

Just don't expect to be cheered up ;)",

Refusing to accept this fate, Woodruff heads to Mexico in search of a doctor who is offering medication based on bolstering the immune systems of AIDS sufferers. Responding well to the treatment, he sets about creating a \"buyers club\" whereby the drugs can be provided free of charge to paying members so bypassing American drug laws. It is the American FDA together with the pharmaceutical companies and some of the medics that come out badly in this movie as they connive and scheme to deny AIDS suffers drugs that they need in the quest for profit. Woodruff strikes up an initially uneasy partnership with an HIV positive transvestite, Rayon, played by Jared Leto on his quest to outwit the authorities by any means possible. Both McConaughey and Leto are fantastic in this movie and absolutely dominate it, however they are ably supported by Jennifer Garner as a sympathetic medic and the rest of the excellent cast. The movie manages to be funny in parts as well as deeply moving and troubling and, while plot wise, it is a fairly simple tale, the characters are so well developed and played that the film is never dull. My only criticism is that, sections of the dialogue were rendered inaudible due to the mumbling delivery, something that at times, made me feel like I was missing something important.",

When redneck Ron Woodruff is diagnosed with AIDS and told he has thirty days to live, his denial in the beginning soon fades away as his health severely deteriorates as the weeks go by. Determined to get the drugs he needs, Ron sets up a members-only club helping the sick.\r\n\r\nThis story is one worth telling and thoroughly absorbing throughout, I'd never heard of Ron's story and how deep he got involved with the FDA, and his smuggling programme through Mexico, plus the extremes he went to in order to improve his health. Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e's direction is smooth and filled with loads of fade to black cuts, normally after Ron has some sort of accident or collapse, then waking up in hospital. I like how Vall\u00e9e doesn't resort to using music in his scenes, using the power of camerawork and the cast's performances to draw the impact out.\r\n\r\nMcConaughey has come a very long way, leaving behind his bad days of films such as \"Fool's Gold\" and \"Ghost Of Girlfriend's Past\" and starring in hits like \"Mud\", \"Killer Joe\" and now this insanely good movie. McConaughey looks fragile, scrawny and I genuinely thought he's a different man, a man that is now Oscar worthy. The accent is pitch perfect, the behaviour, traits and moments of rage and descent all come together for an award winning performance. Jared Leto too, he had me stunned, hands down one of the absolute finest pieces of acting I have ever seen in my life. It's unbelievable Leto is behind that mascara and big wigs, his performance is heartwarming, tragic towards the end and at times amusing when Rayon has his quips with Ron. Jennifer Garner is one of those actresses that always puts in 100% and she was brilliant in this as Ron's caring doctor Eve Saks, Garner is down to earth and utterly believable.\r\n\r\nThere's not a single note wrong with this movie, it's never slow and manages to keep you hooked, and I'll say it again the performances are out of this world, a must see Oscar hit.",

This is living proof that it's amazing what you can find out after a little investigation into the world of medication and the politics behind it. Anyway, the movie is quite deep so you do have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it, but it's very entertaining and an eye opener for anyone whose interested in this subject matter. Enjoyable! \n\nRound-Up:\nMcConaughey smashed this role to pieces. The whole weight lose thing, really did work for his character and the chemistry between him and Leto was brilliant. The film really did deserve all of the praise that it received from its audiences because the director added some wit to the deep subject matter. I know that this film won't be everyone's cup of tea, but you can't fault the amazing performances. I'm still amazed that it's a true story. It really does show how messed up politicians are. \n\nBudget: $5million\nWorldwide Gross: $55.2million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there deep dramas about a man trying to find a cure to live longer with aids. 8/10",

But how do you tackle such a subject without making the audience uncomfortable?\n\nGive the lead to a compassionate McConaughey and write him in a way that alienates as few people as possible. The result: Ron Woodruff, a homophobic, free-riding Texan who enters the ER as a \"man's man\" and leaves as the most recent individual afflicted with AIDS. As selfishly (and believably) as possible, he tries to find a solution to the problem, accessing the local library, meeting again with one of his doctors (Jennifer Garner) to offer his \"cures,\" and finally fleeing to Mexico in the search of non-toxic drugs not yet tested by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the process, Woodruff starts the Dallas Buyers Club, an avenue for persons with AIDS to receive non-FDA-approved medicine in return for a small membership fee (small only compared to that required to buy AZT, the FDA-approved solution to AIDS at the time). \n\nThis storyline implies a transition, and for Ron Woodroof, this was from fear of homosexual lifestyles and behavior to staunch support for those going down the same path in illness that he was. While this progression to acceptance by the lead was believable because of superb writing and editing, McConaughey deserves the bulk of the credit. The headlines will highlight the pounds he lost to prepare for the role, but hopefully the Academy will zero in on this role not because of the lack of body mass but the heart shown in his performance. Like Christian Bale a few years ago in the David O. Russell film The Fighter, the weight loss serves to accent the character's affliction, but the majority of the performance lies in the talent of the actor.\n\nThis transition was not without the help of others (both in the production of a believable storyline as well as in real life). If there was one other person responsible for the paradigm and moral shift in Ron Woodroof, it's Rayon, portrayed by Jared Leto. A transgender woman, Rayon is an early business partner in the Dallas Buyers Club, and more than anything, convinces Ron to accept the company he is part of after his diagnosis. \n\nAlso filling this role (in a lesser sense) is Ron's old friend TJ, who after initial unpleaseantries with Ron has his own personal reasons to accept Ron's position as a drug supplier, if not Ron's outlook on those afflicted with AIDS. In the scheme of the whole film, TJ's role is small, but is perhaps a microcosm of how the general public was affected by the issue as a whole. \n\nThe characters, both how they're written and the way in which the cast performs, provide the bulk of the elegance and impact Dallas Buyers Club supplies, but unfortunately the story arc cannot supplement these performances adequately. The pace and intrigue built in the opening and middle acts completely overshadow the climax, a court ruling, which takes the audience almost by surprise. By the time we realize that McConaughey's return from the case is the climax, the credits are rolling. \n\nThe merit of Dallas Buyers Club goes beyond the exploration of the treatment of those with AIDS by the FDA some 25 years ago. Instead, we get to see a character overcome stereotypes, not just with regards to the opinion of others about him, but also his opinion of his compatriots. Some will construe this film as having a view of the FDA as the all-evil program concocted by government fat-cats. I hope this isn't the takeaway for most. More than anything, Dallas Buyers Club documents the actions of a few brave individuals when they felt that those in charge didn't have an adequate response to the AIDS epidemic. \n\nRead more reviews at RJGFilmAnalysis.com",

            "content": "Watched this movie last night for the first time, as I wanted to see if Matthew McConaughey truly deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor and to be honest, even though he did a very good job on his performance, I'm sorry to say that out of all the Best Actor nominees, Leonardo DiCaprio (The Wolf of Wall Street) acted much better than McConaughey and deserved it better, and I truly thought that DiCaprio was robbed.\n\nThe film has fine direction, splendid performances by the supporting cast (Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto in particular) and successfully captures the feel of Texas. McConaughey, as I said before, does a fantastic performance as Ron Woodroof, and we can see that this role was his to nail as he gets to be as Texan as he can be. I commend him for being able to pull the Christian Bale move (when he did it in The Machinist) by losing a lot of pounds to be over-the-top skinny for the role. The critics are right that this performance is his career-best.\n\nNow let me tell you something funny. I never saw this film before the Oscars and I was rooting for Jared Leto to win Best Supporting Actor because I felt he did a good job on playing a woman (sort of). And he did win, and I was glad he won. So I saw the film, and yes, he deserved it. I saw Bradley Cooper, Michael Fassbender and Jonah Hill's performances, but Jared Leto was the best that acted. And he totally deserved the Oscar. Jared Leto is that rarity: a man that can both sing and act. He nails the role of a transgender man who made himself behave and look exactly like a woman, but is a prostitute. \n\nThe film has no score but it is an impressive movie and given that it has themes of AIDS and has an intriguing true story of Ron Woodroof, they make the movie very worthy of its Best Picture nomination.\n\nIf you're a proud Texan, you'll love this movie, but the film is R-Rated and has parts that make it hard to watch like nudity, drug use, sexuality and harsh language. But it is a good movie and you'll love it if you're a Texan and especially if you're one of those Thirty Seconds to Mars fans called the Echelon.",

It tells the true story of AIDS patient Ron Woodroof, who smuggled pharmaceutical drugs into Texas to distribute them against the approval of the FDA. Both being funny and an emotional confrontation with the truth, and dealing with thematic such as AIDS, homosexuality and drug addiction, I would definitely recommend people to see it. I like the fact that the protagonist changes from a macho to a open minded guy who wants to help people. The film won several Awards. I would like to praise the performances of the cast: Matthew McConaughey (The Wolf of Wallstreet, A Time to Kill), Jennifer Garner (Pearl Harbor, 13 going on 30), Steve Zahn (Joy Ride, Daddy Day Care), Dennis O'Hare (Milk, Channeling) and a remarkable Jared Leto (Fight Club, Requiem For a Dream) as transsexual Rayon. \n\nIn 1985, electrician and rodeo macho Ron Woodroof (McConaughey) is diagnosed after fainting with AIDS. According to doctor Sevard (O'Hare) he has 30 days to live. Ron realizes he has had sexual intercourse with a drug addicted prostitute. Because AIDS is considered a 'gay' disease, Ron loses his job and his friends. From doctor Eve Saks (Garner)he learns that the hospital is testing a new kind of drug. The man bribes a janitor and takes the experimental drug, but eventually ends up in the hospital. There he meets transsexual Rayon (Leto), to who he is hostile. \n\nAfter leaving the hospital Woodroof travels to Mexico, where he goes to an illegal clinic and hears from a doctor that the experimental medicine was poisoning him. After three months there, Ron is feeling better. He decides to help others by smuggling pharmaceutical drugs from Mexico into Texas. Because he's not very good at approaching HIV-patients, he makes a deal with Rayon. The two become business partners and establish the 'Dallas Buyers Club'...",
