    "summary": "In the mid-1970s, charismatic English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Austrian perfectionist Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl) share an intense rivalry in Formula 1 racing. Driving vehicles that are little more than gas-filled, rolling bombs, Hunt and Lauda burn up the track, all the while pushing themselves to the breaking point of physical and mental endurance. Meanwhile, the women (Olivia Wilde, Alexandra Maria Lara) in their lives can only watch as both drivers risk death with every lap.",

            "content": "Ok, so the movie starts out feeling pretty superficial and vapid with the whole, \"Ohh I'm a fast driver and women want to have sex with me, look at how hot I am, I'm a playboy\" sort of thing. It definitely feels like a Hollywood blockbuster sort of movie, I'll just say that. James Hunt seems like an annoyingly prideful person with a super inflated ego who thinks way too highly of himself. While Niki Lauda seems kind of arrogant and haughty. I'm only 15 minutes in and I can already tell that the biggest problem with this movie is that the main characters are unlikable. \n\nI guess I find it pointless and silly that the whole story is about two guys who hate each other and their rivalry that continues to persist through the years. To me it's like, meh whatever lol. For a movie that's grounded in reality and acts as a biopic, it feels pretty unrealistic sometimes. They over-glamorize certain things which makes it look phony or ridiculous. \n\nFinally some great genuine humor when Niki and the pretty girl get stuck in the countryside of Italy and they're trying to get a lift and a car stops only to show its two Italian guys fanboying over Niki instead of paying attention to the pretty girl. It sucks to see that it wasn't until Niki had a bad accident that he became more human and humbled. But I guess we each have to go through our own problems, trials and tribulations in order to become a better version of ourselves. That was really admirable of Niki to go back and race in a Grand Prix only just gotten out of the hospital. I like how James sort of became protective over Niki - bashing that one rude reporters face in after his stupid question to Niki. You can tell James feels guilty and really bad for not supporting Niki's suggestion that rainy day. What I don't understand is why the frick didn't they postpone the race? Those conditions were extremely dangerous and hazardous to drive in, yet they still went on with it. I guess the head honchos of the Grand Prix in Japan didn't care at all about the drivers safety, unbelievable. \n\nI think the most interesting aspect of the movie was how complex the relationship between Niki and James was. The rivalry started out legitimate, then it turned into a media sensation, but then at the end it was all just for show. In the end, they had a respect for one another and kind of looked out for one another. I thought that was pretty beautiful. Niki learned to be more human and friendly, while James learned to be more humble and less of a show off. It actually turned out to be quite a beautiful story of how a rivalry can actually become a meaningful experience where two people can learn and benefit from one another. Niki was smart, he took precautions and lived a slower life while James was more live fast die young, and die pretty young he did at age 45 from a heart attack. An interesting and complex relationship between two people that hated each other but ended up being something prosperous for one another. \n\nOverall I thought it was a good movie, even though I almost gave up during the first half. Luckily, the second half picked up and it got much better, with the story becoming more gripping and exciting. I think what I loved most of all was seeing all the changes in the relationship between Niki and James and how each one learned from the other and benefitted in some way. They pushed each other to become better. The movie does suffer from a plethora of cliches, but I understand that it's based on a true story so its whatever. The movie also serves as really good commentary on how we present ourselves to the world vs. how we really feel inside. In the end, even though it was a good story, I don't think I'll be watching it again. I do recommend it though.",

The parallels run rampant, with both films involving racecar driving, two male protagonists, and plenty of high-octane competition scenes. The relationship between Bruhl and Hemsworth, unlike Bale and Damon, manifests as a rivalry rather than a working relationship. The way in which the two develop their relationship satisfies the viewer, yet feels contrived. In the moment, one feels the thrills and the painstaking analysis in the contrast of the two men's approaches, but this contrast reeks of oversimplification and lack of nuance. Bruhl performs marvelously and Hemsworth decently, despite being outshone. Alexandra Maria Lara probably chews the most scenes after these two, despite Olivia Wilde also being around, but both of the relationships around these two felt slightly underdeveloped and unfocused. It was nice to see a familiar face in Stephen Mangan, although he had little to do. Natalie Dormer's involvement irked me, as she was sexualised from the first moment and then discarded. I understand that this reflected the life of Hemsworth in all of its profligacy, but I feel she possesses more talent than that role offered. All in all, I find FvF preferable in the niche category of racecar films.",

On and off the track these rivals clash yet while maintaining the upmost respect for one another and the sport of racing. With a hair pin margin for error, both men are willing to risk it all for the ultimate glory of becoming champion. \n\nThe great Ron Howard had certainly cemented himself as one of the greatest directors of our time even before this glorious film. The set up of shots during all the races were impeccable leaving you feeling like you're in the race yourself, bravo to the cinematographer. With Hans Zimmer helming the score we hear the tone set beautifully. The deep introspects of each respected driver was also very well done with no wasted moments. Daniel Bruhl played his role with magic portraying the real drive and obsession it takes to be champion. Chris Hemsworth is also quite impressive also, portraying the hotheaded, overcompensating playboy quite naturally.   \nAll in all the extreme attention to detail makes for a completely perfect film.",

James (Hemsworth) and Niki's (Bruhl) conflict can be likened to that of Kirk and Spock; one is logical and by-the-book, while the other is a wildcard who lives every day like it's his last.  This dynamic makes for a highly entertaining interchange between Hemsworth and Bruhl who give individually great performances.  'Rush' didn't need to be a 2 and a half hour pseudo-epic unlike the aforementioned film I brought up at the beginning.  Clocking in at 2 hours, it was paced better, far more engaging, and had characters that I actually cared about.  Not many racing movies have crash sequences that were this potent for me.  Whenever one of the main characters crashed, I myself feared for their lives and safety.  In the end, while it can't escape some of it's genre's conventions throughout the movie and more so the finale, 'Rush' manages to be an example of a genre movie that doesn't have to be average thanks to its tropes.  It takes these tropes and executes them in a unique way thanks to a strong script and evident care from all involved.",

            "content": "Before there was Ford vs Ferrari, there was Ron Howard's Rush. Unlike the former, Rush focuses much less on the odyssey of crafting the perfect machine and instead focuses on the drive behind the drivers, specifically the brutal rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Daniel Buhl and Chris Hemsworth are both perfect in their roles as the two tenacious men. There interplay is what gives the film much of its electric energy. At first, their relationship seemed to boil down to cliched trash talk, but it soon develops into something much more compelling. The film explores the way that both men need to be at each others heels (or tires) in order to thrive. This connection sways between hatred and admiration throughout the course of the narrative and doesn't quickly fall into the predictable track of hidden friendship. Ron Howard controls all of these dramatic elements with a strong and assured hand. Anthony Dod Mantle's frenetic style, that is present in all of his works with Danny Boyle, is very advantageous to the wild action of the speedway. However, I find the dynamic lighting and dark color palate to be less favorable, as it makes everything look like one of Zack Snyder's graphic novel adaptions. It takes the film out of reality when what it should be doing is portraying the dangerous reality in theses true events. Despite this, the racing sequences are quite good and I would have liked for them to get more screen time. Hans Zimmer's score is as mesmerizing as usual. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Overall: Even with sublime work an all technical levels, Rush manages to get it's greatest win with a true story of man .vs. man .vs. fate that will should surely get you heart racing. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Highlight: There are more than a few unexpected turns and bumps along the narrative that could have been agonizingly straight-forward.",

I am an avid fan of sports films, but this isn\u2019t really a sport, so Rush doesn\u2019t get any benefit of the doubt from me. That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s nothing good in this movie. The character work from Daniel Br\u00fchl and Chris Hemsworth is great, and that\u2019s what gets you invested in the story. Niki Lauda (the man that Daniel Br\u00fchl plays) proves to be the most fascinating person in the film, because he has such a uniquely abrasive personality, and yet shows that there are some emotions underlying that rough exterior. I was definitely interested in where his journey would end up. The fact that this was all based on real events made it that much more powerful, knowing that he had overcome so much in his life to be a success. James Hunt (the man that Chris Hemsworth plays) is much less fascinating. He is simply a jerk that seems to care about no one. That\u2019s where Rush lost me. The one lame \u201csave the cat\u201d moment that they give Hunt is not nearly enough to make me like him. The end didn\u2019t click all that well, because I couldn\u2019t buy that one conversation and a single good deed could turn their rivalry into a friendship. I was afraid he was going to remain the protagonist for the entire film, and his tedious relationships would become an important plot point. Thankfully, later on the movie focused in on Lauda much more, and his intriguing marriage. I enjoyed aspects of Rush more than I expected, particularly the acting, but it never could get over the hump to be a movie I loved. Frankly, I think an ESPN documentary on the subject would be a bit more effective.",

Combine these performances with the stunning vision of Ron Howard and you can feel the tension with every hairpin turn as you try to decide who to cheer for.

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, I m fascinated that they would make a movie about Rush Limbaugh.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) It s not a movie about the Right, it s about going in circles to the Left!\n\nSCOTT: Bahaha, good one, Greg. Rush is the story of the rivalry during the 1970s between two Formula 1 drivers, James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br hl). The movie opens with the two of them bumping cars during a 1970 Formula 3 race in England. Hunt wins the race but Lauda is outraged by Hunt s disregard for safety. Lauda then borrows a large sum of money that enables him to make it to the big time of Formula 1.  Hunt also joins a Formula 1 team and the two men resume their rivalry on the big stage.\n\nGREG: Hunt is a playboy. He is out for a good time. He wants to have fun. And the only thing he wants more than to have fun is to win. Lauda is meticulous, methodical, and rigorous. The only thing he wants is to win. These two men have the same goals in mind, but they have two different ways to get it. And it is these differences that make up the conflict in this movie.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Rush is an impressive movie with an impeccable cast and outstanding direction from Ron Howard.  I can t imagine two better actors for the roles of Hunt and Lauda. These two men remind me of fire and ice, two contrasting styles reminiscent of Kirk and Spock in Star Trek. The resulting tension between Hunt and Lauda, both on and off the track, is pure sizzle and spark.  It s rare to see such a powerful rivalry between two sports celebrities portrayed so well on film.\n\nGREG: Scott, we saw this last week in Prisoners. Two men with the same goal but with opposite ways of approaching it. Lauda is hands-on all the way. Off the track, he works day and night preparing his car. He uses the latest materials, trims every ounce to make his car lighter and faster. On the track, he observes every rule and plays up to but not over the margins of safety. Hunt, on the other hand, is very hands off. He expects his team to work the details of his car and the business of running the race. When the race is over, he s off drinking and carousing leaving Lauda to go home to his dutiful wife. During the race, Hunt crosses the line from safe to reckless - doing whatever it takes to pass the next racer and win the race.\n\nSCOTT: You note the resemblance to last week s movie Prisoners, but I see some important differences.  In Prisoners, the two heroes share the same goal of catching an abductor, but in Rush there is a clear and intense competition between two heroes whose goals are in conflict. Plus, in Rush we see our two hero-celebrities over time develop a grudging respect for each other. In fact, I d say that this growing mutual admiration is an important element of their character transformations during their hero journeys. The pivotal moment in Hunt s development occurs when he punches a reporter who disrespects Lauda during a press conference. Prior to this moment we see only hatred from Hunt toward Lauda, but Lauda s recovery has forever changed Hunt s opinion of Lauda. And of course the key transformational moment for Lauda takes place in the hospital when he shows remarkable resilience in the face of debilitating injury. Watching these two men change and grow in many ways -- as drivers, as husbands, as businessmen, and as rivals -- is a sheer joy to watch.\n\nGREG: What Scott is referring to is a story element that is in all the trailers, but occurs late in the film. Lauda, against his better judgement, enters into a race and has a terrible accident where he is burned all over his body and face. Lauda undergoes painful surgeries to recover soon enough to get back into the race season and contend with Hunt for the cup. What I walk away with from this movie is how much these men come to admire each other and still maintain their own styles. Lauda is ever analyzing and refining his craft. Hunt is constantly looking to have fun while he can. But each learns that the other s way of approaching the race has its merits. Another buddy-hero story I m reminded of is Bill Gates and Steve Jobs who had different ways of approaching the computer industry (Gates in favor of open systems and Jobs favoring closed systems). In the end there is a grudging admiration of the other.\n\nSCOTT: I like that Gates-Jobs analogy a lot, Greg, and perhaps the recent film Jobs would have been a more effective movie if it had focused more on that rivalry with the same effectiveness as Rush. Ron Howard deserves great credit for telling a great dual-hero story that anyone can appreciate, even people like me who have no interest in auto racing. The key is to create compelling, multi-dimensional characters whom we care about and who undergo significant transformation. This was done to near perfection in Rush.\n\nGREG: Rush is why I go to the movies. I fell right into the lives of these two men. I felt the power of racing and the will to win. I came to admire what each man offered and could see myself in their places. When I look back on Rush and wonder what could have been done better, I can t think of a single thing. The film lasted 123 minutes and I wanted more when the story was done. And this is nothing less than what you d expect from a Ron Howard film. Every detail of the story was attended to: from the 70 s look and feel, to the speeding cars, to the realistic crashes. I was hooked from the beginning. For easily one of the best films we ve seen this year, I give Rush 5 out of 5 Reels. And for telling a two-handed story with precision and style, I give Rush 5 out of 5 Heroes. Movie:  Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: I thoroughly enjoyed Rush and am happy to award it 4 Reels out of 5 and 4 Heroes out of 5. The reason I am hesitant to give the full 5 Reels and 5 Heroes is based on my belief that seeking to become the best car racer in the world is much more a quest for personal glory than it is a heroic quest. Last week I gave Prisoners two 5 ratings because the heroic goal was to save lives. We see no such virtuous goal in Rush. Still, I agree, Greg, that Rush is one of the best films of the year. The two main characters are celebrities, not heroes, but it s still a riveting and impeccably-told story. The performances were exemplary all-around and I anticipate an Oscar nomination for Best Director for Ron Howard. Movie: Heroes:",

            "content": "A well crafted character story that may be Ron Howard's best film to date.\n\nTwo-time Academy Award (R) winner Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon) teams once again with two-time Academy Award (R)-nominated writer Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon, The Queen) on Rush, a spectacular big-screen re-creation of the merciless and legendary 1970s Formula 1 rivalry between gifted English playboy James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth of The Avengers, Thor) and his disciplined Austrian opponent, Niki Lauda (Daniel Br\u00fchl of Inglourious Basterds, The Bourne Ultimatum). \n\nI'll be honest, this was the first Ron Howard film I had ever seen in my young life. It left an amazing impression on me, to the point where I praised Ron Howard and his ability to drive character development. Then, I watched some of his other films and I wondered, was this really his only huge highlight? Whether it is or not, it has nothing to do with the fact that \"Rush\" is an amazing film that does nothing but good. \n\nThe thing that I love about this film is its character study. This is based on the true story between drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda, who had the biggest rivalry in Formula 1 racing at the time. It's amazing how Ron Howard told this story, as there were no real protagonists or antagonists. You have two polar opposite people, who act differently and view things differently, but they have the same goal in mind. You see their upbringings and downfalls and in the end, you can see that they're both just people with dreams. They each have their flaws for sure, but it's easy to cheer for both of them and want them to succeed. \n\nNone of this could've been accomplished without our two main actors. Both Hemsworth and Bruhl put up some of their best performances to date. They each, respectively, bring out the personality and drive of their real life portrayals. I felt like I really got to know who these people were and what they did in their life. That's due to their ability to play their roles and bring that emotional drive with them. \n\nI feel like when directors and / or producers look to tell the story of someone's biography or a true event, this would be a great example of that. Like I've said multiple times, both Ron Howard and the cast know how to tell a story about characters. The story is filled with interesting character conflict and it's done so well that you don't necessarily see either side as the villain (because neither side is the villain). It's really hard to accomplish that in a film and if you automatically side with Hemsworth because he's more recognizable, you're just being stubborn. This is such a well made film and I have to give it credit for that.\n\nIn the end, I truly thought this movie was amazing. This is how you should tell a story and how you should execute it. I really don't have any gripes with this film and in fact, I though it was near perfect.",
