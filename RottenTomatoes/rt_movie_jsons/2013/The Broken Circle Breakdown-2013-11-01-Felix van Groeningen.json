I enjoyed the scenes featuring their live performances. The wife Elise is shown to be the perhaps more open, honest and emotional out of the two of them but Didier, the husband, also has his own sadnesses and hopes and so on. Its a somewhat emotionally raw film. The depiction of anger and despair is very well put across and it covers the themes of grief and loss quite well, handling such a delicate subject suitably. Its a somewhat thought provoking film and one I would recommend.",

Well, \"The Broken Circle Breakdown\" is something like that. There is this emotional train aiming at you from the very beginning, and you would like to run away because you know it will be painful and devastating... but in this case you don't, because it is also very well done train. This work goes into my top 5 of more depressing films that I ever watched, that's why I suggest to watch it at the right moment, on the right state of mind. If that is when you are happy, or already sad and vulnerable, I never understood. Just watch it.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de The Broken Circle Breakdown eröffnet mit einer Gruppe aus Bluegrass Musikern und sie tragen vor: \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken.\" Nun muss man dazu wissen, dass diese Musiker nicht \"down-home\" in den Südstaaten der USA leben, sondern in Belgien. Es sind flämische Musiker, die eine 100 Jahre alte religiöse Hymne interpretieren. Es geht um den Zwiespalt, etwas begründen zu müssen oder einfach zu vertrauen. Den ewigen Kreislauf der Welt. Das sind die Fragen des Films: Gibt es ein Leben nach dem Tod? \"Will the circle be unbroken?\" The Broken Circle Breakdown meditiert darüber auf wundervolle Weise. Ein Film über Liebe, Sex, Leid, Glauben und Musik. Der Drehbuchautor Johan Heldenbergh selbst spielt Didier, den Bluesgrass Musiker, der Amerika liebt und seine wunderschöne Frau, die Tätowiererin Elise-Veerle Baetens. Ihr ganzer Körper ist bedeckt mit Symbolen des Lebens und ihren zerbrochenen Romanzen. Zusammen erleben sie ein erfülltes und sinnliches Leben, dass sich auf uns Zuschauer überträgt. Zurückgezogen auf einer Farm mit allem, was die beiden lieben. Bald sind sie zu dritt, Maybelle wird geboren und der Film zeigt die Einheit von Familie und guten Freunden. Auf einmal wird die kleine Maybelle krank. Ich denke, ich habe noch nie so eine gute Kinderdarstellerin gesehen wie Nell Cattrysse! Sie ist das Licht im Leben ihrer Eltern und nun beginnt ihr Märtyrium in dieser für uns so greifbaren Welt, die Regisseur Felix Van Groeningen vor uns aufgebaut hat. Der Bluegrass Soundtrack ist so toll, dass ich mir sogar die CD kaufte! Im Grunde ist der ganze Film aufgebaut wie ein Bluegrass Song. Irgendwann bemerken wir, wie Elises Vertrauen in ihre Welt der Symbolik mit Didiers Einstellung des amerikanischen \"Can Do\" kollidiert: Ist das Leben, dass wir sehen und anfassen bereits alles? Ist Religion nur etwas für Feiglinge? Auf was sollen wir Vertrauen? Alles gipfelt in einer wilden und qualvollen Szene, die uns wieder zum Anfang des Films weist. Didiers Cowboy Band trägt die Songs des Lebens vor in der Hoffnung, dass wir es überstehen: Unbroken. (Dazu gibts unsere Film List mit Titeln aus Belgien auf unserer Empfehlungsseite cinegeek.de",

            "content": "Uniquely combining bluegrass music classics, family drama and relationship studies into one Belgian infused heavy hitter, Felix van Groeningen's Oscar nominated The Broken Circle Breakdown isn't by any means an easy watch but it's a film that offers up many moments of joy, many moments of heartache and features some outstanding acting turns and musical renditions in a familiar like tale that would be nigh on impossible not to respect.\n\nGroeningen delivers his film in a way that may be off-putting to some and it's right to say that at times his structure of flashbacks, flash-forwards and present time scenes combine to create a somewhat disjointed feel to proceedings that weaken emotional ties to what is occurring due to a lack of audience engagement, but when Groeningen nails his scenes, there a sight to behold. Scenes centred around couple Didier and Elise and there young daughter Maybelle are fantastically well played, Didier and Elise's bands musically staged scenes are often highly entertaining and at one pivotal stage moment, incredibly moving and interplay between actors Johan Heldenbergh and Veerle Baetens delivers some of the best one/two double acts by male and female actors of recent memories.\n\nCreating a couple that throughout remains empathetic, relatable and likable, leads Baetens and Heldenbergh (who also co-wrote the screenplay) are wholeheartedly in tune with their characters and their ability to not only act but to sing is an incredibly feat of acting. Both Baetens and Heldenbergh are tasked with many a varied range of emotions, from lofty heights to lowly lows and whether it's at the peak of happiness or the despair of unhappiness, Elise and Didier feel real thanks to these two actors. Didier and Elise's love story in many ways reminds one of Blue Valentine, an intimate and raw love that overtime has been torn at by the harsh twists of life and the structure to Broken Circle Breakdown does feel reminiscent of Derek Cianfrance's tale as previously mentioned in its flash forwards, flashbacks and present day scenes.\n\nAn occasionally joyous, often sombre and sometimes beautifully moving, The Broken Circle Breakdown absolutely deserved the critical and award plaudits it received the world over thanks to its fine movie making, high calibre acting and perfectly constructed soundtrack. A tale not to uplift but to in its unique way inspire, this is a film all lovers of classy dramas, world cinema and connoisseurs of toe tapping bluegrass should track down at the next available opportunity.\n\n4 and a half terandas out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

It had a smart script and a meaningful look at death and faith.  Perfectly structured, it fluidly swept from past to present.

Putting the first morning sequence before the first meeting sequence adds an element of mystery to this woman and their relationship. Even the scene-level choices are excellent: when the child comes home - how many songs did they have to consider before deciding on \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight,\" which works perfectly with the theme and the emotional effect of the moment?\nOverall, I had to look back at the other nominees for Best Foreign Language film, and while I understand why The Great Beauty won, I only now realize how tough a choice that was.",

So I was half paying attention half way though, a little annoyed at all the chronological changes. So I started fast-forwarding it because I heard the ending was great. Indeed it was.\n\nIt's a well-made, artistic flick. Have to respect that. Just didn't like the way the story was told. Though the time changing was very effective for the end scene, it is unnecessary most of the way. Along the way, there are some great scenes...when he yells at her and calls her names and she eventually breaks...great scene. And the stage scene is over the top but again there is good emotion. Finally, not even getting too invested in the characters, that final shot is pretty damn moving.

It is an emotional roller coaster that will literally drive you to tears and tackles religion and belief in good in a unique way that suits it's narrative. It also brings in world events into the picture (such as 9/11) in a completely unpretentious way. And then there is the music!!\nThe movie centers on a couple whose six-year-old daughter in 2003 develops terminal cancer and how that event rattles their perfect relationship. The present day (2003) events are? intercut with earlier days of their relationship. As the movie plays along, the narrative becomes more and more non-linear, which is a bit confusing at the beginning but handsomely pays off by the end.\n\nHe is Didier (Johan Heldenbergh), a welder and lead singer of a bluegrass band. He is the romantic in the story; he finds it difficult to control his feelings and emotions. But he also is a non-believer. She is Elise (Veerle Baetens), a tattoo artist who gets introduced to bluegrass by Didier and eventually sings with his band. She is the opposite of Didier - a rational believer. How their differences are of no significance at the early years of their relationship and how they are fleshed out when their daughter is sick is something to behold. The two leads are a tour-de-force portraying flawed characters that one gets to relate to and sympathize with.\n\nWriter-director ?Felix von Groningen does a great job maneuvering the non-linear story structure for the film's benefit. Also, the music is an important character with a lot of beautiful classic bluegrass songs.\n\n\"The Broken Circle Breakdown\" is sometimes difficult to watch but nonetheless well worth watching. It kept me thinking throughout and stayed with me long after I have seen it. A modern classic! Adapted by the director from a play by lead actor Heldenbergh and Mieke Dobbels. Nominated for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.",

            "content": "I, admittedly, am a sucker for melodrama when it's done right. This film could be accused of lacking subtlety in parts or having it's premise stretched out too thinly in the last 40 minutes. However, it's a brilliantly acted piece that doesn't so much pull on your heartstrings as it does yank you down to the floor by them; and I loved it!\n\nA tragic story of loss, grief, religion, the human spirit and bluegrass music is wonderfully brought to life, largely by writer/actor Johan Heldenbergh and captivating co-stars Veerle Baetens & Nell Cattrysse. The two lead performances are as powerful as they come; handling delicately the balance of a flourishing romance crumbling into the despairs of grief.\n\nThe non-linear script captures the moments in which these factors define our central characters' lives, depicting wonderfully how such raw happiness can so quickly evaporate with so little to connect the two. It's bittersweet and some may argue manipulative, but that's what these characters are going through - manipulated by the bitterness of loss.\n\nThe tone is helped, mostly, by the soundtrack. A lonesome country sound follows us throughout and is only misplaced or overdone on two occasions. It also helps frame the breakdown of Elise and Didier byway of their relationship on the stage which crescendos in a quite stirring scene.\n\nUsually I hate the sick child stuff. The US are horrible at making these types of melodrama for TV movie audiences, but Felix Van Groeningen gets most of it right here. It can't have been nominated for an Oscar for nothing, no matter what some may say.\n\nYou might love it, you might ate it. I believe it is powerful enough to divide opinion that strongly, but watch it either way. It's going to be better than a lot of things you see this, year mark my words. Plus, it has one of the most natural and least annoying child performances I've ever seen on screen.\n\n4.5 out of 5.",

            "content": "I had no idea what to expect from The Broken Circle Breakdown, but as it was a well received film which was said to be much like Walk the Line, I decided to check it out.\n\nThe Broken Circle Breakdown is like a mix of Brokeback Mountain, Walk the Line and The Rabbit Hole because it combines many of the themes from each film, making it a country themed romantic drama involving country music and a troubled marriage at the hands of a sick child. And with massive ambitions, director Felix Van Groeningen takes the opportunity and writes an exceptional story which is full of intelligent and realistic language, and then directs it to massive success. The Broken Circle Breakdown was so firm in its drama because it respected viewers enough not to dissolve into formulaic material, and it instead takes a lot of unexpected twists and turns without overloading the film with them. The Broken Circle Breakdown is consistent in its drama and it's gentle pace, and even though the material is a little familiar, director Felix Van Groeningen manages to find ways to transcend that.\nUnlike many other films with a plot structure like The Broken Circle Breakdown, this one actually makes it work. Often, constant jumps between different time periods can prove jiggering and confusing, leaving viewed uncertain about why had happened or what time it has happened in. In The Broken Circle Breakdown, director Felix Van Groeningen manages to get it dead on. The plot structure in The Broken Circle Breakdown becomes one of its most key elements, because thanks to the clever script writing and the director's keen eye for appropriate imagery, it is really easy to tell when things are happening in the chronology of the story. A lot of the time, one scene will contrast the next and will display significantly different experiences between the characters to ones they have previously experienced. This creates a lot of firm drama for the film and makes it all an interesting experience because it defies the formula of the usual drama film which deals with such material and leaves viewers with uncertainty about what will happen next or how to feel. It is a real emotional rollercoaster which is all over he place, and it is a very interesting experience which never gets confusing. And each segment of the story is given an appropriate length so that the scenes never feel short and pointless or as if they drone on for too long. Even though The Broken Circle Breakdown keeps making jumps between different timeframes and doesn't remain consistent in the time periods, Felix Van Groeningen manages to execute it well enough so that every scene is dramatically spot on. And the pure strength of The Broken Circle Breakdown was powerful enough to almost have me left in tears. There is  lot of potential written into The Broken Circle Breakdown by Felix Van Groeningen, and he harnesses it as director by giving it the perfect dramatic treatment and an interesting plot structure so that it is built on firm roots and can only get better from there which is exactly what happens. \nAs well as being dramatically great, The Broken Circle Breakdown is visually very appealing. Although at times the lighting may be a bit from for viewers to really see what is going on, especially during the nighttime sequences, the visual style of The Broken Circle Breakdown is great.\nThe country themed scenery of the film is beautiful in The Broken Circle Breakdown, and the cinematography captures it greatly. And it always maintains a sort of dry greyish colour palette which keeps the dramatic mood of the film symbolised by the visual style. And it is all captured with really great cinematography which sometimes captures the grand scale of the countryside and at other times is a lot more focused on maintaining the atmosphere of the film, particularly in the very dramatic scenes because it is at those moments that the cinematography turns very atmospheric in capturing the claustrophobic state of mind that the characters are in. So the cinematography in The Broken Circle Breakdown is beautiful.\nAnd also, although I don't fully understand why the many foreign actors are always singing in English, the bluegrass music in The Broken Circle Breakdown is beautiful and is composed of a lot of wonderful country tune, sung with the passionate voices of the cast and played with talented musical strength on behalf of the same people. It gives a really good edge to the film and manages to be mood setting at times, so the music in The Broken Circle Breakdown proves to be a very nice touch.\nAnd lastly, the thing that makes the material so compelling is the performances of the cast.\nJohan Heldenbergh gives an exceptional lead performance in The Broken Circle Breakdown. He is consistently strong with his approach to the material, and there are many moments where he becomes especially strong because he constantly feels real in how he delivers his lines. His physicality constantly has a rough edge to it which has plenty of emotional strength, while his line delivery has the same. Frankly, Johan Heldenbergh's performance in The Broken Circle Breakdown is great because it is an honest one. And when he plays and sings Bluegrass music, you can see a certain kind of spirit in him which shows the passion he has for it all. When Johan Heldenbergh sung, I saw the face of Kris Kristofferson in him. And when he acted, I saw the passion of Josh Brolin in him as well. So Johan Heldenbergh brings natural strength to the the role of Didier Bontinck which makes him a perfect lead.\nAnd Veerle Baetens gives it a fine effort as well. The young woman is a very beautiful and talented actress who takes the chance in The Broken Circle Breakdown to prove what she is really all about, and her effort is absolutely fearless. Packed with emotional strength, Veerle Baetens takes on the of Elise Vandevelde without trouble and makes a powerful impression as the mother of a sick child, the wife in a troubled marriage and the young spirit who loves tattoo art and Bluegrass music. When she sings, she had a beautiful voice. And when she acts, you can see her baring her soul out to the audience, and it is very impressive and compelling. Veerle Baetens gives a firm performance in The Broken Circle Breakdown, and sharing a grand chemistry with Johan Heldenbergh, the two of them make a powerful leading duo.\nThe performance of the young Nell Cattrysse in the part of Maybelle is also terrific because her youthful charm makes it easy for audiences to find themselves truly caring about her, and so when she becomes ill it creates a serious impact on viewers. It is difficult for a child to portray someone so sick without a lot of issues, but Nell Cattrysse manages to do it within the timeframe of a mere few screen moments. She makes the film all the more compelling and harder to face, and in her youth she captures the love of the audience and the innocence of the character without fear, and it is thoroughly impressive.\n\nSo despite a sense of familiarity in the themes, The Broken Circle Breakdown takes an all new spin on its story and makes use of an interesting plot structure and exceptional acting to prove just what kind of an excellent filmmaker Felix Van Groeningen truly is, and it's nomination for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film is one of the most well deserved of all the nominees.",

The fusion between the characters, the story and the Bluegrass style make an excellent combination to feed the film with interesting fuel, but it is the Bluegrass which acts as a unique bond between the two protagonists and unites their passionate love and different perspectives about the American culture, music and religion, trying to consummate them into something of eternal length. Nevertheless, there were two fundamental factors in their lives that brought down the whole romantic edifice:\n\n- Both were not ready to begin taking decisions about somebody else's life.\n- Both had differing religious views. This is the most important feature, because it is a fact that different beliefs condemn a marriage to never work literally 100% of the times (as proved by the Bible and supported by Social Research).\n\nRegarding the second point, the plot description made it clear since the beginning that both characters had different views, and the first minutes of the film reaffirmed this. My initial forecast was that such an issue would have to play an important role in the development of the events. It actually did, making me increase my final rating. This conflict should be placed in a very important place regarding the analysis of the film, because it makes the entire final result more meaningful.\n\nThe entire final product seems like a Hollywood melodrama recycled for the thousandth time that was desperately trying to improve during the last 10 minutes with forced and rather questionable editing techniques that made the audiences scratch their heads. Nevertheless, more meaningful substance than the one offered by the typical romantic story is addressed without the need of being exaggerated, and a strong appeal towards marital responsibility and the sacred power of parenthood are exalted with a dedication from the cast to the performance of country music that deserves one big applause.\n\n73/100",

All the emotions are put to the extreme with the intense acting by the two leads, who seemed so naive and care-free in the first part only to break down all mental borders in the second part to show their destroyed souls and broken hearts. I really did not expect the emotions were put to such extreme, given the likeable characters, the simple and innocent settings, and of course the relaxing bluegrass music at the background - a type of Blue Valentine I had guessed after watching its trailer. But so wrong my thought was - this film is all about heart-brokeness, all about how people collapse once they loose their dearest in life. In a way, such extreme approach makes this film less effective and subtle than films like Blue Valentine.

It tells the love story of two bluegrass musicians and their struggles in life. Although this is not the genre of movie I really like, I must praise the brilliant performances of Veerle Batens (Loft) and Johan Heldenbergh (Steve + Sky).  The plots sticks and its music is divine. At the time I wrote this the movie is nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards. I would love this movie to win. Fingers crossed! \n\nWhen musician Didier Bontinck (Heldenbergh) walks into a tattoo shop, he falls head over heels for the beautiful but heavily tattooed Elise Vandevelde(Batens). Although the many differences, they form a couple and share their passion for music. Elise even becomes the lead singer in Didier bluegrass group. When daughter Maybelle is born, their happiness is complete. But seven years later, the child becomes very ill. Elise and Didier act very differently. Their relationship is put to the test. But Maybelle needs both her parents to help her fight the illness.",

Most groups, however, will simply fizzle away or completely implode when relationships become strained.

            "content": "This is one of the saddest, most depressing movie I have ever seen. A real downer if there ever was one. It mixes sad scene after sad scene with bluegrass music. The music scenes are this movie's form of comic relief. \r\n\r\nIt wastes no time in starting out depressing. The first real scene of the movie is in the hospital where two parents are struggling to deal with their child who is fighting leukemia (I think).  From then on, it really doesn't get much better.\r\n\r\nI have several problems with this movie. The first is that it jumps around too much. Fairly early in the movie, it says \"seven years earlier\" that is the last time caption we see. Scenes from that time period take place before and after the \"seven years earlier\" scene. It makes it very difficult to follow. There is past, present, and future, and there is really no telling which is which. They don't change appearances. They don't change scenery. Everything is the same. The only way to differentiate is to assume by what is going on. It's very hard to follow. Along with this problem, there are essentially 3 separate story arcs throughout the movie. There is the time where Maybelle is alive. There is the time after that, which deals with their relationship. The relationship story is also told with scenes from the past and future. Then there are the scenes with the music where everything is seemingly happy. The problem is that these seem so separate. There is hardly any link between them. Along with that problem is that there is no central theme to this movie. It is trying to convey three messages with these three stories. I believe the three messages to be on life, love, and religion. The message about life is that it is essentially bleak. An oversimplification would be that mankind is doomed. The next is that love cannot and will never work. People are not meant to be together forever. Relationships have to end eventually. And obviously the message about religion is that it is false. So we have three themes, not one of them particularly sticks out or is emphasized more than the others. And we have three story arcs. This movie is trying to be three things at once, and that just is not possible. \r\n\r\nAlso, the scene where he has an outburst in front of the large crowd was not a good one for several reasons. It seemed rather out of character for him to bring his views into a performance. The way it was handled was unrealistic. The director basically just gave Didier the floor to rant about religion for a while. Nobody else did anything until he was done. The crowd did not react almost at all. The other members of the band just stood around like everything was normal. It did not make sense. And afterwards, no one really seemed to care about it. It was forced and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, I reject the notion that this movie is just trying to invoke tears, or that it is trying too hard or artificially. I don't think that was the intention. I think this movie is much more than just a tearjerker. It would be an injustice to call it that. Was it trying to evoke sadness? Of course. Was it doing it just for the sake of trying to make its audience cry? Absolutely not. \r\n\r\nWhile I listed all the problems it had, they are not the worst things it could have done. The random sequence and the separate stories only serve to make the movie seem clunky, but not necessarily bad. They do work to a certain extent, but I believe it could have been better.",

Who knew that the phrase \"Belgian Bluegrass\" could hold such promise? I certainly had no idea. This also happens to be one of the most beautifully photographed - and acted - films of 2013, as well. It's too bad that it completely breaks down (pun not intended; well maybe . . .) in the final third. Still, until it does fall apart, this story of love and loss among Flemish Bluegrass aficionados is extremely powerful. Adapted from a play by Johan Heldenbergh (who also plays the male lead), the movie tells the story of Didier (Heldenbergh) and Elise (an absolutely luminous Veerle Baetans), who meet, fall in love and have a child, all the while performing in a Bluegrass band. Their idyll is shattered, however, when their daughter becomes ill, and though the film manages for a while to walk a fine line between genuine tragedy and maudlin mayhem, it eventually crosses over irrevocably into the latter. Before it does, however, you will hear stunning music and shed a real tear (or two or three).",

Like an oncoming storm, the intimate human relationship of Felix Van Groeningen's film is one often impeded by inexplicable cosmic penalty and punishment, almost like if Lars von Trier directed \"Once\".\n\nWhere it touchingly provokes is in the tragedy of its bruised emotional turns. Also helps the camerawork by Groeningen is potent and gritty while staying natural enough to never become overbearing. If some of the grim narrative beats feel familiar, it's the genuineness and authenticity with which \"Broken Circle's\" fractured recounting is woefully designed -- loaded memories flooding dizzily back, hapless and haunted, as its tale of past events bloom and the circle remains unbroken.

He is a gospel bluegrass enthusiast and singer who is drawn to the blonde beauty who loves body art and believes her body is a gallery.  While he loves bluegrass tunes he is not a religious man and his beliefs of nothing conflict with those of Elise who is a modern, Biblical realist (she believes but is fully aware the text is open to interpretation and acceptance).  It appears to be an \"opposites attract\" love story but it isn't ... as the story also quickly becomes about them as parents to a young girl diagnosed with a threatening form of cancer.  The film isn't linear and scenes are interspersed throughout making the viewer wonder what it is he/she is seeing and when it is actually taking place.  Broken Circle has some knee-slapping musical montages as the stage performances are great but the film also has stark drama and some of the most heart-wrenching moments in film this year that could leave an audience devastated.  Perhaps personal experience with childhood cancer made me see how realistic parts of this film is ... it is almost too much so.  Baetens should be more famous than she is -- she sings, she acts, she screams, she cries.  She haunts.  Broken Circle Breakdown is a very good film that perhaps takes a few things too far (there is a political diatribe that is a bit excessive); but it is damn good drama.",

            "content": "Terminal illness in children is perhaps one of the most sensitive, difficult things a film could depict. The screenwriter, director and actors have to balance the coping strategies of the parents, who know the full truth, and the child, whose version of the facts (if any) is distorted by well-meaning parents, and then depict these distortions. The Broken Circle Breakdown does a good job of looking at the tensions inherent in lying to a small child with cancer. Maybelle, daughter of Didier and Elise, is a six year old child with cancer. At various points throughout the film we see the various ways in which the couple try to divert or otherwise explain away Maybelle's illness and the question of mortality, a question she asks when a bird dies before her. This, and strong performances from Veerle Baetens as Elise and Nell Cattrysee as Maybelle, are what salvage the film. \n\nFor The Broken Circle Breakdown is not merely a film about Maybelle's illness and the impact on the family, however, but also about American bluegrass music. If the two do not seem a natural fit, it's because they aren't. Right until the film ends, it feels as though the film's writers just wanted to incorporate this particular fetish into a film about a couple with a dying daughter, and once the final scene makes clear that the emotional power of this music in times of trouble is the theme, it's a rather disappointing one. Otherwise, the hillbilly culture which the family is surrounded by is diversionary more than anything else, de-emphasising the universality of their tragedy by having it hit such an oddball family. \n\nThe film's structure further distracts from and generally undermines its serious themes. By constantly flicking around between the past - which generally consists of little more than fragmented episodes from the rather generic courtship between the parents - and the present (Groeningen focuses merely on important episodes, with the effect that Maybelle is never anything more than a cancer victim, or, more cynically, the spanner in the works of her parents' relationship). About half-way through, George Bush starts appearing on TV and the film turns into a mini-critique of religious impediment of scientific research so that, when we reach the climax, we really do not care any more about the fate of Didier and Elise. \n\nThe Broken Circle Breakdown takes a complex structure and fills it with shallow characters. Some of the treatment of Maybelle's illness is tender, but the film otherwise misses the mark with its overly broad scope and psychological weakness.",

Perhaps I would've enjoyed this more if I hadn't seen Blue Valentine, but so many elements from that movie seemed borrowed here by Belgian director Felix Van Groeningen. It has a similar narrative as the story is told in non-linear fashion focusing on a couple falling in and out of love. What did work really well here were the two lead performances who made every dramatic moment seem very real and authentic. They shared an incredible on screen chemistry without ever overdramatizing their scenes. They also did their own singing, and they have incredible voices so that drew me in as well. Some of the dramatic scenes were really sad and the film also touches on some very heavy handed themes, but they work thanks to the performances as well. It is a touching film that will pull on your emotional chords and it can be a bit too preachy at times, but I still enjoyed this film despite its flaws. By the way, The Broken Circle Breakdown is Belgium's official submission to the 2014 Oscars for the best foreign language film category. It has a shot at being nominated, but I don't think it will win. I think the two lead actors deserve more recognition than the movie itself. \n\nThe plot centers on the relationship between Didier (Johan Heldenbergh), a cowboy banjo player for a bluegrass country band, and Elise (Veerle Baetens) a tattoo artist who has her own shop. The two meet and quickly fall in love, but the film cuts back and forth between their relationship when they first met and then seven years into their relationship as they deal with their daughter's (Nell Cattrysse) illness. Both deal with this tragedy in different ways, which eventually begins to shake their apparently steady and strong relationship. The story jumps back and forth as we see the couple falling in and out of love. The entire film centers on this couple and everyone else around them is barely significant to the story.\n\nVeerle Baetens and Johan Heldenbergh give very good dramatic performances and their characters are given much substance. They carry this film and keep our attention even through some forced moments where the story seems to lose its balance. Didier is an atheist, but he loves America and is obsessed with bluegrass music. He finds it silly and offensive to think that people actually believe in religion, but at the same time he sings gospel songs like Over in the Gloryland and Where the Soul of a Man Never Dies. Then all of a sudden after he experiences some deep tragedy he begins to rant on how stupid people are for having faith. This isn't a complaint I have with the movie, as much as I do with his character, but I just don't understand why people wait for some personal tragedy to hit them to then all of a sudden begin caring for something. It just shows how selfish we really are because until it hits home we didn't even think about it. Now all of a sudden, the culture he has always loved is full of people he hates because their faith hasn't allowed stem research to develop as quickly as he would've liked. The way Didier deals with grief just made me dislike his character, but I guess the writers wanted to include this to make this some sort of science versus religion story. I thought it just became a little too heavy handed and preachy when it could have focused more on the soundtrack and let the music touch these characters since it was such an important part of their lives. In my opinion the performances and the music saved this film and got it through some of those difficult and cliched scenes. The Broken Circle Breakdown is still a very good dramatic film and one I recommend.",

They shared an incredible on screen chemistry without ever overdramatizing their scenes. They also did their own singing, and they have incredible voices so that drew me in as well. Some of the dramatic scenes were really sad and the film also touches on some very heavy handed themes, but they work thanks to the performances as well. It is a touching film that will pull on your emotional chords and it can be a bit too preachy at times, but I still enjoyed this film despite its flaws. By the way, The Broken Circle Breakdown is Belgium's official submission to the 2014 Oscars for the best foreign language film category. It has a shot at being nominated, but I don't think it will win. I think the two lead actors deserve more recognition than the movie itself. \n\nThe plot centers on the relationship between Didier (Johan Heldenbergh), a cowboy banjo player for a bluegrass country band, and Elise (Veerle Baetens) a tattoo artist who has her own shop. The two meet and quickly fall in love, but the film cuts back and forth between their relationship when they first met and then seven years into their relationship as they deal with their daughter's (Nell Cattrysse) illness. Both deal with this tragedy in different ways, which eventually begins to shake their apparently steady and strong relationship. The story jumps back and forth as we see the couple falling in and out of love. The entire film centers on this couple and everyone else around them is barely significant to the story.\n\nVeerle Baetens and Johan Heldenbergh give very good dramatic performances and their characters are given much substance. They carry this film and keep our attention even through some forced moments where the story seems to lose its balance. Didier is an atheist, but he loves America and is obsessed with bluegrass music. He finds it silly and offensive to think that people actually believe in religion, but at the same time he sings gospel songs like Over in the Gloryland and Where the Soul of a Man Never Dies. Then all of a sudden after he experiences some deep tragedy he begins to rant on how stupid people are for having faith. This isn't a complaint I have with the movie, as much as I do with his character, but I just don't understand why people wait for some personal tragedy to hit them to then all of a sudden begin caring for something. It just shows how selfish we really are because until it hits home we didn't even think about it. Now all of a sudden, the culture he has always loved is full of people he hates because their faith hasn't allowed stem research to develop as quickly as he would've liked. The way Didier deals with grief just made me dislike his character, but I guess the writers wanted to include this to make this some sort of science versus religion story. I thought it just became a little too heavy handed and preachy when it could have focused more on the soundtrack and let the music touch these characters since it was such an important part of their lives. In my opinion the performances and the music saved this film and got it through some of those difficult and cliched scenes. The Broken Circle Breakdown is still a very good dramatic film and one I recommend.",

            "content": "Elise (Baetens) and Didier (Heldenbergh) are the parents of a six year old girl undergoing chemo therapy. Through flashbacks, we see the early days of the couple's relationship, when the pair spend half their time love-making and the other half obsessing over bluegrass music, Elise becoming the lead singer in Didier's band. Through flashforwards, however, we see the disintegration of their relationship as they disagree about how to deal with the cards life has cruelly dealt the couple.\nThere's an old phrase, \"The devil has all the best tunes\". Anyone who is a fan of music knows this is far from the truth. Until relatively recently, religion and music have gone hand in hand; it could be argued neither could have developed without the other. Would congregations be so willing to attend ceremonies without the euphoric release of a good singalong? Would the great composers of Europe have gotten to practice their craft without the backing of the church?\nThe title of 'The Broken Circle Breakdown' is a reference to 'Will the Circle Be Unbroken?', a popular Protestant hymn that went on to become a standard of the bluegrass genre of music. There's a reason why music has long been associated with religion and it's nothing to do with musicians somehow feeling closer to God than the rest of us. The simple fact is that for a long time the only way to get your music heard was to pander to the church. Most of the great classical art of Europe is religious in tone; that's simply because the Catholic church were footing the bills. Likewise the Appalachian mountains, where bluegrass sprang from; if you wanted to play to a large audience you had to play in a church. It's knowing this that allows atheists like me to enjoy music whose lyrics I thoroughly disagree with. Besides, I've always believed in separating the artist from the art.\nDidier, however, ultimately struggles with this compromise. We see him originally declare his love of America, in his mind a romanticized land where \"everyone gets to start over\". He embraces his idea of Americana, dressing like a cowboy and fronting his bluegrass band. Upon discovering that America's religious right are the reason that science can't progress to a stage where it can save his daughter, he grows to despise the land he once viewed through rose tinted glasses. The lyrics of his beloved bluegrass songs, which he had likely never thought too much about previously, begin to haunt him, a reminder of how the fate of his daughter is doomed by the faith of others. Like Malcolm McDowell's protagonist of 'A Clockwork Orange', who has his beloved Beethoven used as a weapon against him, Didier loses the one thing that always brought light into his world. On the other hand, Elise, unfamiliar with bluegrass before meeting Didier, begins to embrace the spiritual themes of the music as a way of finding comfort.\nThe two clash over a question of evolution involving a dead crow. Early in the relationship, Elsie asks Didier to erect a veranda to keep the rain off them while they sit on their porch. Didier originally refuses, as he wants to gaze at the stars. A compromise is reached and a glass veranda is built. When a crow is mortally wounded by flying into the glass, Didier refuses to lie to his daughter about what happens to a creature after its death. Elise resents him for upsetting the child. As so often happens with compromise, both parties end up feeling cheated.\nThe structure is similar to Lars Von Trier's 'Dancer in the Dark'. For every scene of abject misery (and there are plenty) we get a moment of relief through musical scenes that will have you tapping your feet in your seat. Ultimately though, it's a hard watch, not one you'll be in a rush to revisit.\n\nImmediately following my screening, I felt somewhat ambivalent to the film but after a day of reflection I was declaring it a masterpiece, ready to award it a perfect score. After a couple more days to chew it over, however, I'm finally too troubled by the \"misery porn\" element to hail it as any kind of masterpiece. Over the years I've grown to appreciate laughter over lectures and the tone of this film is too unrelentingly dark for me at this point in my life. (As a younger, more cynical man I likely would have shouted about this from the rooftops.) \nIt's not the best film of the year, nor is it my personal favorite, but in tackling the thorny issues of compromise and our secular relationship with the leftover tropes of religion in a manner I haven't seen before, it's certainly one of the must-see (once) movies of 2013.",

Tattoo artist Elise (Veerle Baetens) and atheist folksinger Didier (Johan Heldenbergh) tell their tale of how they fell in love, had a beautiful daughter, and how their world fell apart around them.  When I first started watching this movie, it was hard for me to grasp what I was watching because the story is told in parts that jump forward and backwards in time.  Unless you know this going in, it takes some time to figure it out and could leave you feeling lost before the story starts to come together.  After the first 20-30 minutes of the movie, you really start to figure out how the story is being told and it becomes more interesting.  I think this was the point of the movie that I saw true character development and was able to have emotional feelings for these people.  At the 45 minute mark, I was thinking to myself, \"why isn't this movie over yet?\" but the last hour I couldn't look away.  This movie is an emotional rollercoaster and the 2 lead actors are GREAT!  It reminded me of the Ryan Gosling/Michelle Williams movie Blue Valentine but with all the happy times thrown in too, and that makes a huge difference!  For those of you that are English speaking, this movie is from Belgium but it has little parts of English (mostly the cursing HA!) so be prepared to read subtitles.  Even though it is foreign, I wouldn't mind seeing more films from these 2 actors because they are easy to watch on-screen and give very convincing performances, but more importantly, they are likable.  I wouldn't be surprised to see this movie show up in certain Oscar categories come this winter, so check it out, but it's probably only worth 1 viewing...\n\n7/10 Stars - It could have gotten a higher rating from me out of sheer artistic nature, but I don't like depressing movies, so I give it a solid 7!\n\n \n\nHer Review:\n\nThe Broken Circle Breakdown is a heart wrenching film that tugs and pulls you through highs and lows so that you are emotionally exhausted by the end of the two hours.  I want to start with the story.  My husband is right, they tell it to you in an odd way.  At the start it took me a bit to figure out what was going on and when because it just kept jumping times but not a lot of time so you didn't have anyway really to identify if you were in the past or present.  While frustrating, it settles down eventually and you get the flow and a better understanding of the cinematic choice to break the timeline up like that.  If you put this aside you are left with a dramatic story that really touches you because it just feels so real and true.  On a side note I wasn't sure about the whole Bluegrass thing when the movie first started but it really serves as a glue for the film and plays an integral part in moving the story forward.  It even adds another level of emotion to a few particular scenes that you wouldn't expect.\n\nPart of the greatness of The Broken Circle Breakdown stems for the performances of Heldenbergh and Baetens.  They really deliver in their roles.  Had their performances been any less than they are I don't think the film would be quite as good.  They just seem to work together.  I am curious to see what else they might have appeared in.  Plus, I don't know anything at all about the director Felix Van Groeningen but he brings the audience a film that even while emotionally exhausting as I said, is still powerful, thought-provoking and quite inspiring.  If you get the chance I would definitely see The Broken Circle Breakdown.\n\n8/10 Stars - My husband is right this movie is seriously depressing but it is wonderful none the less and I was more than impressed!",

In reference to a reoccurring theme in the film, The Broken Circle Breakdown may be the ultimate mixture of the American and European cinematic structures in both language, clever structure but also emotional and psychological depth. The broken circle breakdown, in fact, is an original, deeply melancholic and grippingly moving domestic drama with unique takes on the themes of life and death. The central characters of Elise and Didier are very romantic, rebellious and conventionally cinematic, living on the edge of conventionality in a nostalgic type of rebellious life. And while the comments on American politics may seem explicit, they are not as direct as they would seem on the surface, as they represent the end of the dream and the disenchantment with life that Didier experiences after tragedy threatens his family and his idyllic lifestyle. Van Groenigen's choice to juxtapose scenes of different time and place never gets in the way of the flow of the film, which ends up being powerful, harrowing and haunting - on top of that, the musical interludes are welcome additions and indeed play a key role in the shaping of the film.",
