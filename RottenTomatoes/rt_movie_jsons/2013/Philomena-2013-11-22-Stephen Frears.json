    "summary": "In 1952, Irish teenager Philomena (Judi Dench) became pregnant out of wedlock and was sent to a convent. When her baby, Anthony, was a toddler, the nuns took Philomena's child away from her and put him up for adoption in the United States. For the next 50 years, she searched tirelessly for her son. When former BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) learns of the story, he becomes her ally. They travel together to America to find Anthony and become unexpectedly close in the process.",

Even under the tragic past and overall sadness of this story, there runs a dazzling current of understated humor between these two unlikely friends.

            "content": "Philomena is searching for the son who was taken from her fifty years ago and given up for adoption by the nuns running one of the Irish Republic's penitential Magdalene laundries.\n\nThe usual inducement employed to coerce unmarried mothers to give up their child is that he/she would have a \u2018better' life; a life without the stigma of illegitimacy, and one of comfort of the material things the single girls couldn't hope to afford. But the nuns and priests who ran the laundries were keeping a secret that was far more shameful than illegitimacy even in 1950s Ireland: taking money from American Catholic couples for the babies of the unmarried mothers. They were running baby farms.\n\nThe desolation of the young Philomena (played superbly by Sophie Kennedy Clark) and the other girls forced to work seven days a week in Dickensian conditions in the laundry is gut-wrenching. And Judi Dench as the older Philomena has the remarkable ability to evoke an extraordinary depth of emotion just by staring into the middle distance.\n\nSteve Coogan, who co-wrote and produced the film, may have reprised the character since, but here he leaves his comedic turn as Alan Partridge firmly behind playing Martin Sixsmith, the former New Labour political advisor who was sacked over smear allegations and a leaked email, from whose book the film was adapted. Returning to work as a freelance journalist, Sixsmith happens upon Philomena's story, and takes her to America to search for her missing child.\n\nHaving sex out of wedlock is still considered a mortal sin by the Catholic church, but the mental and physical cruelty metered out by the nuns in the Magdalene laundries, and the selling of the girls' babies as their penance was reprehensible; a shame that will rightly haunt the church until the last mother has been reunited with (or at least discovers what happened to) their child.\n\nThe pain inflicted of the young unmarried girls \u2013 one who died in childbirth and was buried in the grounds was just 14 years old \u2013 is unfathomable and unforgivable. However, despite the seriousness of the subject matter and the depth of emotion is evokes, there's a lightness of touch to the script that never once resorts to being mawkish.\n\n\nSTREAM OR SKIP IT Rating: \ud83d\ude01 Outstanding. Adapted from Martin Sixsmith's book, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, the BAFTA winner of Best Adapted Screenplay is a definite must-see.",

As for the premise itself, the fascinating thing about it is despite a dark and frankly evil starting off point for their journey, the film itself is surprisingly quirky and charming.  That really comes down to Philomena herself.  Not just how wonderfully she is played by Judi Dench, but how great the real life character is.  Despite all that has happened to her, she keeps her faith and optimism, and that is truly the spirit of the film.  Also, she's just a godamn delight of a human being and truly funny.  The chemistry between Judi Dench and Steve Coogan is spot on, and his cynicism with her optimism is a delight.  The movie has a simple goal in the end, but it does so with great character and charming leads.  It's heartwarming and fun and I really liked it.",

But unlike those films, the tone relies far less heavily on comedy, opting for some dramatic and feel-good moments instead, brought to life by Coogan as the pessimistic foil to Dench's relentless optimism and kindness (which is tested approproately). There are many great moments for the latter in particular, seeing her get lost in the character, a nice contrast to some of her more confident, strong-willed M that has added to her formidable reputation in recent years. Well-directed with an eye for tone, an exceptional job by Frears. (4/5)",

In this 2013 film, directed by Stephen Frears, Judi Dench plays Philomena, a woman forced to give up her young son for adoption many years earlier.  Steve Coogan plays a journalist seeking redemption for possible past professional indiscretions by assisting Philomena in the search for her long-lost son.  The film examines how we manage our suffering and pain on a daily basis and ultimately deals with forgiveness and the recognition of our own shortcomings.  Effectively directed by Frears, close-ups linger on Dench for extended periods to help register her intense pain and her longing to be reunited with the son she loves.

Now, this type of film can feature regular looking people who face tragedies not related to their lover marrying somebody else or dying in a historical tragedy. This film is a prime example of the genre as it succeeds due to a winning screenplay and two complex, nuanced performers that are sure to move audiences. While I have never considered Stephen Frears to be a \u2018great' director he knew to keep this film fairly short and let the actors do all the work.\n\nJournalist Martin Sixsmith, Steve Coogan, has been unceremoniously ousted from the BBC and feels depressed as he is not sure which career to pursue. He eventually decides to write a human interest story about Philomena Lee, Judi Dench, who became pregnant at a young age and was forced into a nunnery by her family where she gave birth to her child, Anthony. She was forced to do labor for free in order to get out and her son was given to an American family to be adopted against her will. The nuns stonewall all of Lee's attempts to find out about her son and the two later learn that they burnt all documentation of the adoption. Fortunately Sixsmith has contacts in the United States that help them track down her son. Sadly all is not what it seems but a close relationship does form between Sixsmith and Lee that helps both of them to grow as people.\n\nDench is stellar in the leading role as she blends the quirks of a cute old lady with the emotional depths of some of her more serious roles in A Room with a View (1985) and Iris (2001). All of this adds up to emotional devastation for the audience as we feel an intense rush of sympathy for this lovely older woman who has faced so much in her life and yet is willing to forgive those responsible for her suffering. She is matched by Coogan who, while he has the less emotional role, embodies his character perfectly with his typical biting wit and an unexpected touch of sadness. Together they are utterly charming as Dench recounts the plots of ludicrous romance novels to him while he remains politely disinterested before finally giving over to her deceptively strong will.\n\nThe film is also able to target an incredibly scary issue as uneducated young women find themselves pregnant with no support system and have all of their options removed in favor of being exploited by a tyrannical religious organization. Yes, the nuns can seem a bit broad strokes at times but the justifications they present are those that real figures responsible for similar problems have provided and the self righteousness with which they speak makes them almost pitiable as they are unaware of how cruel they are. Contrary to what some believe the film is not anti-religion as the main character retains her religious principles by being forgiving of others for their \u2018sins' and the villains are condemned not because they are religious but because they took a child away from his vulnerable mother and then used her for their purposes. You feel angry that this happened at the end of the film but also uplifted as while Lee lived a tragic life she remained friendly to those around her and has not lost her ability to forgive.\n\nThe film's screenplay should have won the Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award because it's witty, warm and capable of dealing with serious issues at once. 12 Years a Slave (2013), the Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay winner, was a film that I had significant issues with in terms of it's writing and I think it's \u2018weighty' themes may have helped it more than it deserved.

I am not sure whether she was indeed like that or whether the sanctification has been made for dramatic purposes. Still, Dench manages to not overdo it and to stay just within the confines of the believable. She might, indeed, have felt great anger and even more, but managed to process it within herself and still keep it quiet and polite. The whole affair is a subtle and deep study of the human nature, of its ugly and evil and beautiful sides. I think the movie also serves as a great example of the hypocrisy and cruelty of some representatives of the Christian faith--not that we haven't known it already but it's a useful reminder.",

If the script is a let down, then Stephen Frears saves it brilliantly through its amazing execution skills that doesn't fail to impress the audience. Judi Dench stands alone on performance in here as she is the core strength and the highlight of the feature despite of Steve Coogan's decent act. Philomena is surely an important feature that draws out essential questions and emotions on screen but on terms of drama; that is its genre, it fails to create the anticipated impact.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, we just saw Philomena, yet another movie this year that is  inspired by a true events. \n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) It seems as though Judi Dench can portray almost anyone. Lets recap.\n\nSCOTT: We meet an elderly Irish woman named Philomena (Judi Dench), who had a son while she was a young teen. Her family was so ashamed that they sent her to a Catholic convent where she worked seven days a week and was only allowed to see her son one hour a day. One day the convent gave her son to adoptive parents without allowing Philomena to say goodbye to him. Fifty years have passed since this painful day, and now Philomena wants to find out what happened to her son.\n\nGREG: The trail leads to America where Philomena and investigative reporter Martin (Steve Coogan) fly to find the adult son. Philomena has been thinking about him for 50 years and is worried that he might be homeless, or sick, or God forbid, obese. What happens next is an amusing fish out of water story as Martin and Phil traverse America in search of her long lost son.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, Philomena is a charming story that chronicles two different hero journeys. First, there is the tale of a woman searching for a big chunk of her missing past. She s looking to recover this missing quality and we, the audience, derive great satisfaction seeing her handle both triumph and setback as her story unfolds. But there is an equally interesting story of a journalist, Martin, who is also looking to recover from a serious blow to his career. He believes that pursuing Philomena s  human interest story  is the means to restoring his professional dignity but he discovers that the story carries more personal weight than he ever could have imagined.  Both of these hero journeys contain enough surprises and intrigue to keep us keenly interested throughout the movie s 98 minute running time.\n\nGREG: True enough, Scott. Martin is a confirmed atheist, having rejected the Catholic church. He is a constant contrast to Philomena s steadfast faith. Despite all the nuns did to her and the pain they caused by taking her son from her, she never wavers in the power of her beliefs. There are a couple of missteps in an otherwise fine screenplay. One involves Mare Winningham who gets star credit for a single scene where she plays the grown sister to Philomena s lost son. The scene adds little to the movie and the sister seems to have lost interest in her  brother  and her Irish roots. It s a bit confusing.\n\nSCOTT: At first, we have trouble taking the character of Philomena very seriously. She initially comes across as na ve and ditsy. But as her story unfolds, we begin to appreciate some hidden heft to her character. She ends up showing more maturity and grace in the face of adversity than we could have imagined. And we see her embodying Christian ideals far better than the Catholic nuns who mistreated her for years. Her hero journey is a delight to watch, and it is captured nicely in Martin s recitation of a T.S. Elliot quote about finally coming home but seeing home in a fresh new way. Martin s hero journey is less settled but no less interesting. He believes that his atheistic perspective gives him greater clarity but the movie suggests that this clarity comes with a price. There is much food for thought about how Martin s life will be changed by this experience.\n\nGREG: Scott, Philomena is a non-traditional buddy story.  I was captivated from the start. Dame Judi Dench does not disappoint. She has created a complex character full of life, and whimsy yet still wise. I enjoyed this movie and give it 4 out of 5 Reels. The two-handed hero s journey intertwined these characters and gave those with and without faith an opportunity to look at the world through the other s eyes. I give our heroes 4 out of 5 Heroes. Movie:   Hero: \n\nSCOTT: Greg, I agree with you that Philomena offers a unique dual-hero journey that compels its audience to think deeply about issues of faith, ethics, family, and conscience. There is a rare wisdom in this movie that moved me and challenged me to re-think my perspectives on religion, secularism, and life in general. Like you, I award this movie 4 out of 5 Reels. But I m going to bump up the hero rating to 5 out of 5.  Philomena s hero journey is wonderful to behold. She is no doubt forever changed by her experience and we can see a lovely transformation of understanding, compassion, and wisdom in her character. Juxtaposed with this is the more uncertain hero s journey of Martin, who is affected in profound ways by the journey but one gets the feeling that unlike Philomena, Martin has a lot more processing to do to truly appreciate what has happened to him, and to them both. These two very different hero journeys, and how they are intertwined, impressed me greatly.  Hence the full 5 out of 5 hero rating. Movie:  Hero:",

            "content": "Philomena is directed by Stephen Frears, and it stars Steve Coogan and Judi Dench in a British drama about a journalist name Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) that is fired and is looking for something to work on, which he manages to find someone to do so which is on Philomena Lee (Judi Dench), who is looking for her son that has been taken away from her by the Catholic nuns when she was young. I wanted to go back to this movie because I remember going across this only for the fact that Steve Coogan co-wrote this movie, and the only film that I've seen besides this that he wrote was Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, and I had a great time with that film. So with this film, I enjoyed it even more. Judi Dench and Steve Coogan are fantastic in this as it's interesting to see them work together, I like how restraint Steve Coogan can be when dealing with Judi Dench's character at some points of what she says. The writing by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope is well-written that understand how to make the mystery interesting with some effective drama, while also putting humor that came mostly from Judi Dench's character that are really funny. The chemistry between the two leads is really good that they really want to know where the son is, and when they know the news about Philomena's son, they both show a way that makes them emotionally, but in totally different ways. At times I didn't even know whether the footages that it has are real or not because the quality of them felt genuine that I wasn't quite sure about its legitimacy. Philomena is a fantastic film that I was glad it was recognized.",

            "content": "In a quest to face her past and find her lost son, Philomena continues to believe in God. A true story that allows the clash between beliefs, classes and morals. The movie Philomena (2013) directed by Stephan Frears, starring Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, tells us the story of Philomena Lee, an Irish old lady who was strained to work in the Magdalene asylum due to pregnancy out of wedlock by the catholic church in 1952. Then, Lee was forced to put her son, Anthony, into adoption. She encounters an unemployed journalist, Martin Sixsmith, who agrees to help her find her son and then publish her story. After fifty years, what do they expect to find? The purpose of the journey to uncover the hearts of the mothers similar to Philomena, who suffered to \"atone their sins\" with the loss of their children. The director Stephan Fears presentation that evoked the emotions of the viewer in addition to the acting abilities of Dench and Coogan have illuminated the story of a mother and child in an emotionally magnificent way. Despite the difference in origin and time, the viewers are put in a situation to question the beliefs of modernism. \n\u00a0Before looking at the form of the film, one would look at the context of the film. The story exposed a form of oppression against teenage mothers with excuses of following the will of the bible. However, this oppression has provided for churches an income to stay by putting children for adoption for a certain price. Nowadays, this treatment has faded to the ground due to the lack in God's existence in people. Strangely even after leaving the church for many years, the protagonist (Philomena) continued to treat the nuns in the catholic church of Sean Ross Abby well, which showed great devote to the God and Jesus. Judi Dench's portrayal of this honest and religiously devote woman was superb, with elements of good emotional expression and tone.\u00a0 On the other hand, the character of Martin opposed that of Philomena. He believed that what the church did was unforgiveable and needs to be address. This character presented the audience's emotions from now then regarding the church's actions towards Philomena and her son. The film did not present complex cinematic techniques the simplicity of the techniques mimicked the subtle air surrounding the film as a whole.\nFor Philomena, the significance was both in the words being spoken, since the film was dialogue-heavy, and in facial expression in particular the focus seemed to be on the expression of the eyes. This meant that throughout the film there were a lot of close-ups focusing on the character's face and body within the shot. these techniques were very simple, moreover, the intent was very obvious: watch this person's face. This is because a person's face will tell us a lot more about what the characters thinking and feeling than what can be said during the dialogue. Another thing to appreciate in the presentation of the film is the static look of the movie. there were lots of moments where the audience is staring at a car driving down the road or people walking along. Nothing too complicated.\nA great example of this is when the movie portrayed the oppression and the prejudice that occurred in the catholic church. the cinematography was nothing too extraordinary; the scene was taken with polished angles and the lighting was dimmed. This set the gloomy atmosphere that the film was portraying. This style of cinematography was done to try to mimic reality in order to capture the emotions of the audience. In addition, the film was not told chronologically, it was edited using flashbacks and the home videos to represent what has happened in the past. the film was color-corrected to present the struggles and emotions through less-saturation.\nPhilomena goes for some gags, but at the center of the movie lies a powerful drama. While the film has a sentimental feel that according to the words of Sixsmith 'weak-minded, vulnerable ignorant people\" it also builds into a striking and surprising contemplation on the dilemma of religious belief.",
