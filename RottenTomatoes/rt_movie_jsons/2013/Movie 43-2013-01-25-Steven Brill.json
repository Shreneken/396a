It's meant to be a parody of some of the dumber movies, ads, and ideas that have come out of Hollywood over the years. It's obviously not politically correct or sensitive and will offend a lot of people. This movie came out over a decade ago. I am pretty sure that this movie could not be produced today, in 2023. Back then you could get away with a lot of things that are deemed offensive and unacceptable today. But remember, this is really a purely \n satirical product. Anyway, if you want to go back in your time machine, have thicker skin, want to watch some politically incorrect toilet humor, you might enjoy watching these series of skits that are lumped into one movie.",

I have never had more of a headache or felt as physically ill watching a movie as I was while watching this.

I have found it because I was looking through the cast, as I was amazed of how many good actors took part in it, as well as I have went through reviews and seen that most of them talk about how disgusting the movie is, so I have decided to check it out and I was not disappointed! The only scene that was not really funny was with Chris Pratt, as you could see how silly it is and how it desperately tries to push out at least some kind of a joke, but otherwise, all the other scenes are brilliant. I found myself laughing at nearly every single phrase someone said. Yes, it may seem gross for someone, but who said that gross can't be funny? I just believe that many people lie about their perception of this movie, just so that they could look smarter in everybody else's eyes. I believe that it is just a tradition at this point for people to leave a bad review about this movie, without even seeing it. There were so many memes about this movie just some 10 years ago and I clearly remember them. Most of the scenes are iconic, especially Halle Berry plastic surgery and Hugh Jackman nutsack. The plot starts off not very entertaining, as you await it's silliness, but afterwards it skyrockets you into the darkest humor possible. A very strong, very brave comedy analogue of which you will never find ever again. It is still a mystery on how so many good actors agreed on taking part in such a stupid movie with such a low budget. Definitely worth checking this out, an 8/10, still relevant, still hilarious.",

            "content": "Omnibus films featuring big names can work as long as the product works well, but Movie 43 fails as it combines the series of shorts into one narrative. There are two versions of the film: One takes place in a producer's conference and the other takes place at a teenager's home before an apocalypse. Some segments have missing payoffs like the one where a grocery clerk Neil (Kiernan Culkin) falls in love with Veronica (Emma Stone) or Batman (Jason Sedakis) giving dating advice to Robin (Justin Long). Others, like the one where Beth (Kate Winslet) goes on a date with millionaire Davis (Hugh Jackman), the one where Amanda (Chloe Moretz) experiences her first menstrual cycle, and the one where a man (Chris Pratt) takes laxatives to show his love for his fianc\u00e9e (Anna Faris) are just an excuse to throw out gross-out jokes. Meanwhile, it throws in socio-political commentary in these sketches, like the sexist ad executive (Richard Gere) pitching the product iBabe to his staff or the 1950's coach (Terrence Howard) teaching the first all-black basketball team. However, other segments are okay, like the game of truth of dare between Stephen Merchant and Halle Berry, the one featuring a gay cartoon cat or a birthday present involving a leprechaun (Gerard Butler). You know your project is in trouble when you title it Movie 43 because these rejected CollegeHumor sketches seem like they were filmed before the producers came up with the title. It especially doesn't work when they bookend these vignettes with a lazy and last minute narrative. I do not object to shock and gross-out comedy, in fact, as a teen, I watched a good chunk of lowbrow shows like \"Robot Chicken\" and \"Family Guy.\" Whereas those were handled with contextual intelligence, Movie 43 is a limp, desperate attempt from over fifteen directors to throw every adult humor on the screen resulting in a giant mess.

After pitching the first of his thirteen offbeat fables, the dejected artist forces the rest of his disjointed allegory on the executive at gunpoint...\n\n\"Movie 43\" was panned by critics, with Richard Roeper calling it \"the Citizen Kane of awful\", joining others who labeled it as one of the worst films of all time. The film won three awards at the 34th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture. Rotten Tomatoes consensus states: \"A star-studded turkey, Movie 43 is loaded with gleefully offensive and often scatological gags, but it's largely bereft of laughs.\" IGN's Gregg Katzman gave the film a 1/10, with the main criticisms being its unfunny jokes and the waste of its all star cast, and the only positive being its sub two hour running time. It would go on to tie with Scary Movie 5 for worst movie of 2013. In his guest review for Roger Ebert's website, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times outright panned the film, giving it zero out of four stars, calling it \"aggressively tasteless\", and going so far as to say \"Movie 43 is the Citizen Kane of awful\". He wrote that the film has nothing in common with The Groove Tube and The Kentucky Fried Movie, two \"very funny and influential\" sketch-comedy films. He additionally criticized Movie 43 for what he calls \"female humiliation\", saying that although the men are \"jerks, idiots, dolts and fools\", the women have it even worse. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph described Farrelly's film as \"the work of a confused man thrashing around in an industry he no longer understands\". Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film zero out of four stars and called it the worst film he had ever seen. Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave it a negative review, saying, \"As a film critic, I've seen nearly 4,000 movies over the last fifteen years. Right now, I can't think of one worse than Movie 43.\"\n\n\"Movie 43\" (The title of the film has no actual meaning to it) was filmed over a span of four years. Production took so long because filming had to be done around the actors' busy schedules. Not screened in advance for critics, because Rouge Pictures was afraid of bad reviews making audiences miss the film. The film was ultimately considered as one of the worst films ever made. I have honestly no idea what I had seen when I finished the film. It\u00b4s a turkey that died several years ago and somebody dug it up from the grave. I can\u00b4t imagine any of the actors were pleased with this mess, however I reckon that is kind of clear since none of the major actors wanted to promote it when it came out. With a cast consisting of for example Emma Stone, Hugh Jackman, Chris Pratt, Uma Thurman, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Halle Berry and Elizabeth Banks, you would think that this might have something to offer at least. But, no.... \"Movie 43\" is a disaster from all angles. I simply can\u00b4t describe it nor understand it. It\u00b4s just offensive, stupid, unfunny and pointless.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Just in time for the new year, it s Movie 43!\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) And what a way to recover from Christmas. Deck the halls with bowels of holly.\n\nGREG: Movie 43 almost defies explanation. It is an anthology of sixteen (16!) different storylines. Each one raunchier and more ridiculous than the last. The running gag in the movie is that each scene is actually a pitch for a movie idea by struggling screenwriter Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid). He s holding a movie producer Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinear) hostage forcing him to listen to each and every story idea, regardless of how horrible it may be.\n\nSCOTT: And man, are the stories horrible.  And dumb, and ultra-vulgar.  At gunpoint, Schraeder brings Wessler s movie idea to the studios chief executive, who ridicules and embarrasses Schraeder.  To get even, Schraeder decides to invest huge resources into the film, knowing it will cost the movie studio millions.\n\nGREG: I don t think we ll have time to review all the stories here. But to give you an idea, the first one deals with a woman (Kate Winslet) on a blind date with a surprisingly eligible bachelor (Hugh Jackman). The only problem: he has testicles on his chin and nobody but she seems to notice. Then there s the one where a girlfriend (Anna Faris) is so in love with her boyfriend (Chris Pratt) that she wants him to poop on her chest. He, in his desire to do the deed properly, eats enormous amounts of Indian food and overdoses on laxatives. The end result is the most massive explosion of diarrhea in film history.\n\nSCOTT: Yes.  For this scene, I thank the makers of this film from the bottom of my.... well, from my bottom. The premise of Movie 43 pretty much guarantees the movies failure.  We know that Wessler s ideas are terrible as he is pitching them to Schraeder, and yet 95% of Movie 43 is spent showing these bad ideas in their full, ahem, glory.  At one point, Wessler suggests that Kate Winslet play the role of the chin-balls  date, to which Schraeder points out that Winslet would never agree to such a role.  But in this movie, where ridiculous reigns supreme, Winslet does indeed play this character. Movie 43 is full of hits and misses, and unfortunately, the ratio of hits to misses is about 1 to 4.  Much of the content of the skits is revolting and bloated with shock value.  Nothing is sacred here.  Jokes about incest, menstruation, and feces abound.  The more outrageous, the better.  In any bad movie, vulgarity is a proxy for good writing, and that s certainly true here.\n\nGREG: Movie 43 comes to us from Peter Farrelly of the Farrelly Brothers (who brought us last years The Three Stooges). The Farrellys are known for their low-brow humor and Movie 43 seals that reputation. This is the worst movie ever - but that is what it is aiming for. Many of the actors originally slated to be in the film found a way to opt-out. It took nearly 10 years to bring the whole picture together as reluctant luminaries were brought in to fulfill their obligations. There is no rhyme nor reason to these vignettes. Although I get the impression that several of them were actual movie synopses that were turned down. If you like Saturday Night Live, you just might like Movie 43. However watching 90 minutes of SNL rejects may be more than you can take. Still, knowing is half the battle. I found Movie 43 delivered on its promise to be lewd, crude, and indecent. And I respect that. I give Movie 43 1 Reel out of 5. No heroes were harmed in the making of Movie 43 so I award it 0 Heroes out of 5. Movie: Hero:\n\nSCOTT: Anthology movies rarely work because there is insufficient time to develop characters and storylines.  Each story is reduced to a single thematic gimmick that is milked for about 5 or 10 minutes and then runs out of steam.  And if the gimmick is truly dumb to begin with, 5 or 10 minutes feels like forever.  The iBabe story is an example of a bad idea that went nowhere.  It s one long sexual joke dragged out to 10 minutes.  Ugh.  Then theres the aforementioned defecation story.  While the idea of pooping on someone is shocking and perhaps even mildly funny, we re subjected to this fecal theme for 10 tortuous minutes.  No thank you. Movie 43 is 90 minutes of shocking attempts at humor that are clever at times but miss the mark far too often.  The conflict between Schraeder and Wessler was uninteresting and served as a bad, bad excuse to film so many truly tasteless mini-stories.  Like you, Greg, I award Movie 43 just 1 measly Reel, with the film on the reel donated to the exploding-bowel man to use as toilet paper.  There were no heroes here, only victims.  And so zero Heroes out of 5 from me, too.",

But, why would like 50 A-list stars want to be in it? Answer: Because it's funny. Get past the unusual format and just want expect to laugh, you will. I watch a lot of comedies and I've been pretty disappointed a lot recently. I can say this movie has more laughs than most that I've seen recently.

            "content": "This movie is a national embarrassment. This is not a movie. This is a loose collection of half assed ideas. I almost want to blame everyone in this movie and ask why they did it? But seeing all these people in this movie, I'm convinced this was someone calling in a favor. Maybe it was like the nephew of a distribution company. \n\nThe plot is about as lazy as you can get for a movie. A crazed Dennis Quaid is pitching these rejected MadTV sketches to Greg Kinnear. Forcing Kinnear to listen at gunpoint, until some little moment between Kinnear and Common becomes the focus of the plot. The end of the movie becomes the \"a movie about filming a movie\" trope, someone yells cut and then it just kind of ends. But then there's another short. And then it ends.\n\nEveryone of the shorts is directed by someone else. So there is zero continuity in between any of the scenes. Yes, by the movie's standard, this is a crazy person writing these, but actually it is not because they break fourth wall at the end. So Quaid isn't actually crazy, they are filming a movie in which Quaid plays a crazy person. So what's the point of that? To tell you that you watched shitty comedic sketches for an hour all because it was a dream...er....it was all a movie? Boo.\n\nAll these shorts reminded me of horrible improv scenes. The scene between Knoxville and Stiffler is the one that comes to mind. The scene starts with these guys as bros who live together. Knoxville apologizes for fucking Stiffler's girlfriend. Then Knoxville makes a joke about his apology. But this douchebag has a surprise for Stiffler. Knoxville captured a leprechaun for Stiffler so he could have the best birthday ever. This is going to be the best day ever. WOOOOO. \n\nPretty much every other skit was the same. But let's not skip over some important cinematic performances. For example, Hugh Jackman having CGI balls on his neck and Kate Winslet agreeing to be in a scene where Hugh Jackman has balls for chins. There was Halle Berry smashing guacamole with her tit and Stephen Merchant becoming a racist asian stereotype. There was the  cartoon cat that wanted to fuck Josh Duhamel. \n\nEven when there were laughs, the scene would go an extraordinary length to kill its own joke. Terrance Howard is a coach of an all black basketball team in the 1950s. The whole joke is that the students are unsure of their skills as this is the first white team they are playing, and basically Terrance Howard is just reinforcing the stereotype that black people can outball white people. Okay concept, but this sketch lasted so long. This reminded me of a reject Chappelle show sketch. \n\nEvery scene of this movie is offensive. Whether it be because of how offensively stereotypical or juvenile the comedy is, or just how lazy the dialog or the filming is.",

If you ask me what Movie 43 is about, I don't know how to answer. All I can say is that Movie 43 has a bunch of funny (sometimes it isn't even funny) YouTube clips played by stars all combined into a full-length movie. \n\tFirst of all, I would rather watched a bunch of videos on YouTube that I would enjoy rather than watching this. Each clip in Movie 43 has nothing to do with one another, not even a link. All it gives you is a crappy premise that a bunch of ass-kids are finding Movie 43 and that it will end the world. Seriously, nothing makes sense in this movie. It involves time traveling, apocalypse, and explosions that will just leave you thinking WTF. \n\tOne thing that I hated the most is that how did so many celebrities ended up in this movie? In the first clip, Kate Winslet is having a dinner date with Hugh Jackman who got balls hanging on his chin. C'mon Hollywood, having an Oscar- nominated actor and an Oscar winning actress in this garbage isn't a good idea. All I can say is that Hugh Jackman does have balls taking this role.\nBasically, each clip after the first one is either the same level with the first or even worse. I might even considering the first one as one of the funnier ones. Later in the movie, you got Naomi Watts and Leiv Schreiber humiliating their homeschooling son, Chris Pratt shitting on Anna Faris, Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott kidnapping Leprechauns for gold coins, and Halle Berry making guacamole with her boobs.\n That's all you got from Movie 43 and now I spoiled it so that you won't have to see this movie. You're going to thank me later. Just sayin'.",

Each segment is worse than the last with their themes of violence, extreme bathroom humor, immorality, and things too explicit to discuss in this review.  It amazes me that thirteen directors managed to create such a distasteful series of shorts.  You would have to consider this an anti-movie without an ounce of entertainment value.  It is criminal that they were able to get the following list of stars to appear:\nDennis Quaid, Greg Kinnear, Seth MacFarlane (well, no surprise there), Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Naomi Watts, Liev Schreiber, Anna Faris, Chris Pratt, Emma Stone, Justin Long, Jason Sudeikis, Uma Thurman, Kristen Bell, Richard Gere, Kate Bosworth, Jack McBrayer, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Patrick Warburton, leprechaun Gerard Butler, Johnny Knoxville (again, no surprise), Seann William Scott, Halle Berry, Terrence Howard, Elizabeth Banks\nReading this cast list, you have to wonder how they could combine for such an unpleasant filmgoing experience.  The pointless 90 minutes of crude, obscene, offensive material drags on and on without reprieve.  Some of the actors tried to get out of it but they were stuck.  I watched this film out of curiosity, having developed an appreciation for terrible movies like \"Birdemic\" over the years.  This is not like that.

For the ones who did not see this movie, thank god for you. However, I am going to explain the plot (if you want to call it a plot). \n\nIt is basically follows a mad producer (Dennis Quaid) who pitches his ideas to a executive producer (Greg Kinnear) who is put into gun point because he did not want to put his ideas into film. The ideas is basically of shorts including Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet going on a date and Winslet sees Jackman with a set of privates hanging from his chin. And Terrence Howard is lecturing his team on how they going to beat this white team because they are black. And the movie also have little informercials (if you want to call them informercials). And there ten or maybe eleven skits that I did not. Why? Because they are not worth for me to mention.\n\nWell, Movie 43 is easily one of the of the worst movies in recent memory. It is so baffling that a \"movie\" like this gets made and release into theaters for everybody to see. The segments, skits, shorts, or whatever you want to call them (if you seen the movie). They are not funny what so ever. The only funny (or somewhat funny) skit, segment, short, and etc. in Movie 43 is (the one that I just mention) the one with Terrence Howard. Yes, it goes to racial stereotyping but it is the one that made me laugh or chuckle. The worst goes to the one involving Josh Duhamel having a cartoon cat who falls in love with him and is coming between Duhamel and Elizabeth Banks (who is one of the directors sadly).\n\nAnother thing that is baffling about Movie 43 besides it has been in production for 3-4 years is the fact that there is such much talent wasted and embarrassing themselves. Most of them were nominated for or won an Oscar or maybe an Academy. It is such a shame that Movie 43 could have been decent or a guilty pleasure but it is not. If anyone have any common sense, please avoid Movie 43 like the plague. It is a waste of time, money, and talent. You will be upset like I was.",

A lot of comedies suffer from being able to be funny at first, but lose steam as things progress. By breaking it up into many stories, had the jokes been good, the writers wouldn't have had to ignore a lack of jokes for the sake of moving the plot forward. It mostly sucks though that there's no time to build up lasting, memorable characters, and that there's little sense of progression.

And all in all, the direction of everyone involved is simply rendered moot. Plainly put: this is not a well made film. And yet, I still felt like it retained some of the aesthetic of regular Hollywood comedies. I sat through the whole thing and you know what? I laughed. It was just so ironic that these sublime actors were in such a ridiculously awful film. Somehow that made it better. At about this point in my review I have about 98% of the world at my house with pitchforks and torches. But, and I know this is actually off putting for many of you, it seemed like they were all having fun. Nobody seemed stressed or anxious. I just don't think it's one of the worst films ever, although please don't think I'm arguing the opposite. Up there with catwoman, batman and robin and transformers films? I simply don't think so. It's actually weird, because these are usually films I despise with every bone in my body and it gave me good reason to as well.

So the question for many readers may be, \"Is it really that bad?\" Well, after seeing it I can only answer yes, sort of. While Movie 43 is a terrible film that is unfunny, filled with occasionally offensive and embarrassing humor, the honest truth is that despite expectations, there are far worse films out there. I have ended films angry and I have ended films endlessly bored. I ended this film neither. I think if I ever made a worst films ever list this wouldn't even be on it. Don't mistake my meaning though, the film is still terrible. Movie 43 is a collection of sketches staring a-list stars that are meant to be gross, offensive, and gerenally low-brow. While they achieve the low-brow part, they fail to make it in any way funny. I'll admit I smirked or chuckled a few times, but the majority of the film is either boring or just plain irritating. I really believe that many of the stars are putting honest effort into their sketches, trying to make them funny, but it's still evident that they are embarrassed to be there. The best sketch in the film is Emma Stones, because it's short and actually approaches something like comedy. The worst would either have to be the iBabe or Halle Berry's and Stephen Merchent's truth or dare sketch. The ibabe one was a little bit sexist and the Truth or dare was just embarrassing. Still, the movie was blessedly short and I couldn't quite call it boring. Ultimately, I walked into Movie 43 with very low expectation and it met every one of them, but after it ended I truly thought that it could have been a lot more painful.",

I already read reviews, saw trailers, and have been told how bad the movie is, but I watched it anyway because I knew it was going to be bad, and I just had to see how bad, but I never thought it would be dog shit bad, but alas i was wrong. Public service DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!",

            "content": "So, the infamous Movie 43 has come and gone, won worst picture at the Razzies, and generally humiliated all who were involved with it. So the question for many readers may be, \"Is it really that bad?\" Well, after seeing it I can only answer yes, sort of. While Movie 43 is a terrible film that is unfunny, filled with occasionally offensive and embarrassing humor, the honest truth is that despite expectations, there are far worse films out there. I think if I ever made a worst films ever list this wouldn't even be on it. Don't mistake my meaning though, the film is still terrible. Movie 43 is a collection of sketches staring a-list stars that are meant to be gross, offensive, and gerenally low-brow. While they achieve the low-brow part, they fail to make it in any way funny. I'll admit I smirked or chuckled a few times, but the majority of the film is either boring or just plain irritating. I really believe that many of the stars are putting honest effort into their sketches, trying to make them funny, but it's still evident that they are embarrassed to be there. The best sketch in the film is Emma Stones, because it's short and actually approaches something like comedy. The worst would either have to be the iBabe or Halle Berry's and Stephen Merchent's truth or dare sketch. The ibabe one was a little bit sexist and the Truth or dare was just embarrassing. Still, the movie was blessedly short and I couldn't quite call it boring. Ultimately, I walked into Movie 43 with very low expectation and it met every one of them, but after it ended I truly thought that it could have been a lot more painful.",

But curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give it a viewing. There are 3 types of movies; there are good movies, bad movies and a small fraction of bad movies that are so bad that they can be enjoyed with the right mindset. Funnily enough, Movie 43 is the latter. Let me start off by saying this movie is not for everyone; only for a small audience who likes incredibly ridiculous vulgar and immature humour. The movie's broken up into various segments of scenes played out by famous actors with a backdrop of a ridiculous plot that isn't even worth mentioning. The thing about it is; some of the scenes were actually funny. I could have just been in the mood to watch it, but some made me laugh out loud. Highlights were the superhero segment, Hugh Jackman who seems to be able to make even balls on a neck funny, amongst others. The movie's so disgusting that I don't expect people to make it through the first half hour. I have no idea how they convinced so many big names to take part in this movie but if it weren't for them, I probably wouldn't have watched it. But with every funny part, there is a really bad part. Some segments were just trying too hard or not funny at all, and they ended the movie on a weird note. It crossed some lines making fun of racism and child abuse, which is probably one of the reasons why it didn't go over well with critics; that and well, the fact that it's not a good movie. This is a special genre of movie that comes along every once in a while that's so bad that if approached in the right way, can actually make it watchable. But for everyone else; avoid. 3/10",

No matter how many times they throw names at you, don't believe it. These highly recognized celebrities make an appearance, but only a few at a time. They don't all tie into a single story and you don't see all of them work together.\n\nI've already stated that this \"movie\" is just a collection of short films. Now about the quality of the individual films. There's quite a few of them, but only one or two will actually be worth a few laughs. The rest are painfully unfunny and poorly written, so bad that it becomes embarrassing to watch some of these actors and actresses. \n\nThe whole point of including recognizable names is to give them characters that people will go see. Here there is virtually no characterization, not that there would be any time for it anyway. Our favorite actors are only here for a few minutes to play a small part and then just like that, they're gone. On top of being short-lived, most of the sketches aren't even funny.

I hope that as I post this review today that I would save as many lives as I can from wasting their precious hours on a piece of shit movie like this. Movie 43 has finally done it making me believe that not only is this the worst movie of 2013, but it is officially in my Top 15 worst films of all time. It really does exceed your tolerance for every single sin that you can possibly think of in a movie and tests the very core of how you watch a bad movie. You know what; I am going to spare you the usual lengthy review for today and just straight up tell you what I thought about this film. The plot sucks, the characters in here suck, the jokes suck, and everything about this (as a whole) sucks major big dicks! This movie sucks dick so much that it sucks dick at sucking dick, that's how bad I think it is. What's even more amazing is that not only were they able to acquire of handful of A-list celebrities and waste their God given talent on this movie, but the fact that this film ever made it off the green light and into the big screen is uncanny to me. This movie needs to burn in Hell along with the many writers who wrote this movie. Fuck this movie and fuck everything about it!",

In the cinema the shock value was what sold it to me, the star power and outrageous laughs had me and my mates leaving the cinema in stitches, but a year on the jokes are wearing thin and becoming less and less funny and being more of a chore to watch. As the months have gone by and a few more viewings the score has gradually sunk and now it's at my lowest score of 50%, and most likely to get lower and lower.\r\n\r\nThe structure is one of the main problems, there are two stories that set up the skits. There is \"The Pitch\", starring Greg Kinnear and Dennis Quaid, and then the other one with annoying teenagers trying to find the most banned videos online. These two different segments couldn't be anymore outlandish and disjointed, they literally have the weakest link to introducing Movie 43's skits, yet in all it's outrageous greatness The Pitch is mildly entertaining and a whole lot more tolerable than the scenes with the teens. \r\n\r\nThis bad pitch sees Dennis Quaid introduce his new film which consists of different stars in different situations, claiming that it's a family movie which is funny because it really isn't. As he divulges into his \"masterpiece lining up to be the next Howard The Duck\", the skits in begin. That's it, there's no underlying story or reason for it all, it's pure shock value and tastelessness, do not watch it with family. The worst part is the scene where you actually see Quaid and Kinnear in the parking lot, and the camera turns to the crew where Farrelly makes a quip, never before has a joke been so flat and unfunny. Here come the skits.\r\n\r\nAn all-star humiliate themselves and act like you've never seen before, almost down to the standards of a Rob Schneider flick, that didn't attract me to the movie but what did was the insane cast list, and I won't lie but I laughed an awful lot. The opening with Kate Winslet and Hugh Jackman is unlike anything you've ever seen, it left me speechless, I didn't see it coming. The homeschool skit with Naomi Watts and Liev Schrieber is cringe and rather twisted, and the i-Babe skit is raucously funny, Kate Bosworth acts as if she has just realised what movie she has got herself involved with. You shouldn't laugh at Movie 43, but I did, the truth or dare with Halle Berry and Stephen Merchant is priceless for all the wrong reasons. This movie scooped up several Razzies and rightfully so, there's no craft or attention to any detail here, just one big joke wrapped up into a 90 minute movie that seems even longer. I'm one of the few that liked this and its crudeness yet it barely defines the saying \"so bad it's good\", it has much bad about yet there are some glimmers of good slapped around.",

In reality, however, it is incredibly bad.\n\nIt was really just made to gross people out.  The first two stories are bad enough to stop you watching any further.  However, there are some funny stories among the crap.  The Batman & Robin, iBabe and basketball stories were quite clever and funny and if the whole movie was like those the movie would have been OK.\n\nHas its moments, but mostly utterly crap.",

The six segment I couldn't even describe, so I stop the film from there. That's how horrible Movie 43 is. It's so bad that I couldn't finish it.

            "content": "Movie 43 is a waste of effort for me. I didn't enjoy every minute of everything this garbage depicted. I checked it out on netflix so I could come up with my own opinion about it. I knew it was going to be a bad movie, but I wanted to see why everyone didn't like it. Upon seeing it, I have come to a conclusion that the reason this movie was made was because the people were desperate for money. By having all those all-star actors/actress in play, it was obvious they cared less about making a good enough story and jokes, and cared more about the A-List cast. Most of them are pretty talented, but they were all waisted here.\n\nNow where should I start? I guess the plot. Unfortunately, it didn't have a story. It follows two guys who are desperately trying to get their script approved by a producer who keeps denying it, after he discovers that each skits are offensive, and that it lacks meaning. That's right, the movie is a series of skits that are totally gross, unfunny, and illogical. I only laughed twice throughout the whole movie, but that still didn't say much. \n\nThe movie seemed like it was made by someone who saw two girls and one cup and most of the spoof movies from this generation. Most of the skits deals with potty humor, genitals, sex, and many other junk. Of course it's a rated-R movie, meaning the filmmakers are free to do whatever they want, but adding a lot of female breasts, poop jokes, sex, and a bunch of F-Bombs don't make a comedy movie funny. I did not laugh at anything that happened here, except for the two skit that were slightly funny. The one where the parents were treating their homeschooled son like crap, and the last one where Terrance Howard's character talked about racism in a basketball game made me chuckled, but that was it. \n\nThe movie was so disgusting, it made me feel totally grossed out. Most of the moments from the film were too gross to look at. I'm not going to bother describing the ones that were nasty to me because I don't want to be reminded. The only good thing about me seeing it on netflix is that I didn't have to pay for it. Sure it was a waste of time on my part, but it was better than wasting my money on a film that I didn't find worthwhile.\n\nI couldn't believe the A-List actors/actress agreed to be in this movie. If I was one of those people, I would reject it as soon as possible. They were all wasted here. There wasn't a single cast member that stood out to me. This wasn't the first movie to add people in a higher status. Valentine's Day did it, then comes New Years Eve. Talk about having to try too hard to appeal teenagers and 20somethings.\n\nAs a whole, I didn't enjoy it. This is just as bad as most of Adam Sandler's newer movies. I'd rather watch Key and Peele than having to spend a little over an hour and a half seeing this piece of filth. At least they know how to make better skits and humor than this so-called comedy. If you want to see a comedy movie that's smart and hilarious, you will not find it here. It would be rediculous for me to hear someone says it's funny because it's not.",

Stubbornly refusing to rise above humor we all left back in middle school, it shoves one overdone \"joke\" in our face after another, painfully stretching the often mean-spirited skits into 10 minutes or more when 10 seconds would have been too much. We are treated to crass, overly offensive attempts at comedy involving literally nothing besides bodily functions, body parts and long-winded, poorly acted monologues. After 55 minutes in, I turned it off, because if this was all the movie had to show me for the first bulk of the run time the rest of it was likely just as worthless. \nOne of my questions about this piece of garbage will eternally be, how did they get these people to be in this film? Did Hugh Jackman really think it was that inspired, original and hilarious to film a horrifically stupid scene revolving completely around his genitals being on his neck? In case we didn't see your balls dip into the gravy the first time, Hugh, luckily the directors zoomed close up several times so we could witness every moment of rib-cracking hilarity. I, for one, have never seen a finer sequence in a movie than when a pubic hair fell into your bowl and you (did he actually do that?! OMG) accidentally ate it! Hilarious.\n\nMovie 43 is the epitome of everything that is wrong with Hollywood, and Brett Ratner is the Tommy Wiseau of comedy. This is six million dollars of money that literally would have been put to better use being thrown randomly off of rooftops. When someone asks me why the stereotype of fat, stupid americans exists, all I have to do is point them to this movie. With an absolute plethora of completely moronic skits and a stupid underlying plot that doesn't even attempt to tie the stupid skits together, one has to wonder what comedy geniuses such as Seth MacFarlane are doing in this garbage. Although the skits are drawn out 10 minutes or oftentimes longer, they wouldn't be funny even in the shortest Family Guy cutaway gag, and Seth, I'm sure, is well aware of this. His constant look of consternation implies an ulterior motive that begins with Pay and ends with Check. Others, like McLovin, simply flail around wildly, their career speeding down the drain with every passing, painful second. \n\nIf you just can't get enough of entire segments revolving around Anna Faris begging Chris Pratt to defecate on her, if you burst into hysterical laughter every time you hear the words \"poop,\" or \"balls,\" or if you guffaw even at the thought of a young girl having her first period at a friend's house, Movie 43 is the perfect movie for you. The rest of us would rather keep our brain cells. It is with great honor that I officially declare Movie 43 The Worst Movie of 2013.",

I did get a few extremely brief moments of entertainment, but the rest of the time spent watching the film was near-unbearable. If you've seen the Red Band trailer then there is no need to watch this movie. You've already seen all of the comedy that the movie has to offer. The only reason why this movie gets a half-star more than crap is because there were actually some moments where, no matter how unfunny the material, I was genuinely amused with watching these celebrities make fools of themselves.

Any one of these sketches would *kill* on SNL, but when they try to make a movie about of them, suddenly we're all too classy for this sort of humor. I for one - along with the actors in this film - don't have my nose quite so high in the air yet that I can't enjoy an old fashioned raunch-fest every once in a while.

If you seriously want to waste your time, money and effort on one of the biggest shitstorms in movie history...Movie 43. But first a little history- the bastards who made this piece of shit apparently said they wanted a movie-length version of online sketch comedies such as FunnyorDie and so they got as many actors as possible. Some accepted the script thinking it was really funny, some instantly declined and others were forced by the studios; how sad where most of them will hopefully have this film as the lowest point in their career! Not only that, if you want to want to make a movie that resembles online sketch comedies like FunnyorDie, fine but do it in a way that makes sense and not in a way that is so off-putting and offensive! And did I mention this thing has a story as well? Apparently it's about some guy whose younger brother keeps pranking him so him and his best friend get their revenge on the brother by saying that there's a worldwide banned movie out there called Movie 43 and he has to look for it so therefore he comes across these clips that I swear to god if I ever watch them again, I will turn that thing off instantly! One gag involves Kate Winslet on a blind date where he meets Hugh Jackman who has testicles on his neck- that's not funny! That's disgusting! Another gag involves Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber as parents and they treat their house in a high-school environment because of their teenage boy- get it? Because he's a teenager and therefore they treat him and the house like he's in high school? Another involves Chris Pratt being forced to do a cleveland steamer on his bitch played by Anna Faris and he is told by his friends during a barbecue that if he does a poop then she's his soulmate and if he does a shit, then she's his whore and it ends with Chris Pratt shitting all over some guy's car. This was just unfunny and boring as hell. And if Chris Pratt doesn't bring me his A-game as Star Lord in Guardians Of The Galaxy in 2014, he will officially blow! Another involves Halle Berry playing Truth or Dare with some guy I don't care about and it was just unbearable to watch! There's a fucking slogan on the poster asking you \"What is Movie 43?\" and the answer is obviously nothing! This movie is just a big piece of nothing! It is just a bunch of horrible clips put together with no story, no context, no whatsoever! Oh and at the end of the movie, Some bad guys warn the teenage douchebags that if they find this movie, the world will end but they find it as it somehow exists for real and an apocalypse arrives and kills everyone except for the older brother who survives in a wheelchair with a cripple and finds his laptop with a cracked screen and watches Terrence Howard give a basketball speech- for fuck's sake quit dragging it out and end this damn thing! You know if this was supposed to be the gross-out comedy special, then Adam Sandler is god compared to this! I don't expect to walk into this thinking a gross-out comedy that is actually funny OK! To be honest, I like gross-out comedies; The American Pie series were hilarious, Ted was hilarious and some of Seth Rogen's comedies such as Knocked Up, Superbad, Pineapple Express and more recently This Is The End were great but this movie doesn't know what it wants to be and therefore crams everything in, throws everything at us and thinks we can take it. Overall Movie 43 is a disgusting, unpleasant, uncomfortable, queasy, sickening, non-sensical, abominational piece of trash that you should steer away from and I know you will obviously watch it to think what the hell am I even saying AND let's hope they don't make a Movie 43: The Sequel, Movie 44 and Movie 45! Movie 43 gets a Some Old Bullshit/10 and I'm tired from bitching at this movie!",

Griffin objects, but Charlie pulls a gun on him.  Via some misadventures, Griffin's boss insists that Griffin go ahead with the project.\n\n    The segments are many and short.\n\n    Most of the segments are rude, crude, and barbaric.\n\n    Luckily most of the shorts are laugh out loud funny.\n\n    However, don't pursue if you do not like earthy humor.\n\n--------Scores---------\n\n    Cinematography: 10/10 Sharp.\n\n    Sound: 10/10 No problems.\n\n    Acting: 7/10 Mixed.  Some hilarious; some incredibly irritating.\n\n    Screenplay: 5/10 A better name for this film would be 'Miscellaneous crap from the Cutting Room Floor.'",

But I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it, and I laughed a lot. As the tagline goes: \"Some movies get an R rating, and some earn it.\" This one definitely earns it. Overall, I give it a pass, but it's not for the faint of heart. Some skits will make you laugh out loud, while others will make you cringe uncontrollably (in particular, the last one will make you feel like you have to take a shower afterwards). Say what you want, but the film constantly subverts your expectations and that's what makes it so fun to watch.",

            "content": "I decided to incur the wrath of the internet today. I have never been interested in contrarianism for its own sake; I have never defended or criticized a film that I didn't feel strongly about. It is with this outlook that I say Movie 43, a sketch film that has earned universal derision from the public and from critics, wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong: Movie 43 is terrible. Some intrepid writers have tried to give the film credit as meta-commentary on the state of Hollywood, but I caution those fine cinephiles that such endeavors are a waste of precious time and effort. Judging by its haphazard production process, it seems little thought went into Movie 43 whatsoever. It is most shocking to know that the Farrelly brothers had anything to do with this film. Remember their loving homage to dimwitted comedy stars of days past in Dumb and Dumber? Or the charming fraternal saga of conjoined twins in Stuck on You? Or how about the nostalgia trip that was The Three Stooges?\r\n\r\nBut then, I would hesitate to call this a Farrelly brothers film in the first place. Although they specialize in gross-out humor, Peter and Bobby Farrelly have surprisingly tasteful style. Movie 43 just doesn't show that restraint and sensitivity, separating it from a true Farrelly effort. The movie also features twelve other directors. The brothers themselves only directed the storyline featuring Greg Kinnear and Dennis Quaid, a thread not even present in foreign cuts of the films. It is unfortunate that the Farrelly name is attached to this disaster, but I would hope that any discerning viewer would know that the fault lies at the feet of more than just two people.\r\n\r\nGoodness knows there's more than enough fault to go around. I think I chuckled twice during the entire film. Once was at the sheer novelty of seeing the talented Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet engage in some of the basest material I've ever seen on-screen - that didn't last. Later, Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts elicit a brief smile with their unorthodox parenting methods. I would hesitate to call either of these scenes funny, but they get a few points for not making me roll my eyes in irritation. The rest of the sketches feel like they were pulled straight out of conversations on middle school playgrounds, which should give you an idea how piercingly intellectual they are. They were designed to shock and appall, but I mostly found myself hanging my head in dejected silence.\r\n\r\nIt almost pains me to say that Movie 43 somehow isn't without its redeeming features. While its myriad sketches all toe the line between awful and dick-wilting, they thankfully fly by at breakneck speed. Ironically, Movie 43 has a better grasp on the problem of one-note gags than the modern incarnation of Saturday Night Live. Where the latter hammers on one joke for far too long, Movie 43 offers quick respite from its sporadic terribleness. Note that this is faint praise, because at least Saturday Night Live is sometimes funny.\r\n\r\nAs sad as it is, that is what keeps Movie 43 from finding kin with the worst Hollywood abominations. Where Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer seem to have come up with their films over lunch, Movie 43 exhibits minor foresight with its random sight gags and loosely connected sketches. Likewise, Happy Madison films like Grandma's Boy find themselves stuck on one godawful premise which they beat bloody until all you can do is pray it ends soon. Movie 43 features similarly prepubescent stories, but no single thread lasts the full 90 minutes. None of these factors make this a good movie, but they offer a baby step up from the bottom of the barrel.\r\n\r\nThe issue with Movie 43 isn't its sub-par content or its desperate offensiveness. No, the real issue is that it offers absolutely nothing to the world of comedy. By extension, I doubt it will add anything to your life. If movies are meant to tap into a universal sense of empathy, as Roger Ebert once said, this movie does exactly nothing right. But it is fast paced and brief, a fleeting thought in the grand scheme of cinematic history. If you hate it, rest assured that it will be erased from our collective consciousness in short order. If you love it, well - I'm sure you'll figure out which shapes go in which holes soon enough. Third grade is waiting for you.\r\n\r\nMovie Verdict: Fail\r\nRT Score: 30%\r\n\r\nLink to Full Review: http://wp.me/p4dFgD-18D\r\n\r\n~ S\u00f8ren",
