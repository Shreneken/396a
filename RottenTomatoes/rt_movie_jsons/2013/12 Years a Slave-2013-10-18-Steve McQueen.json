    "summary": "In the years before the Civil War, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York, is kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South. Subjected to the cruelty of one malevolent owner (Michael Fassbender), he also finds unexpected kindness from another, as he struggles continually to survive and maintain some of his dignity. Then in the 12th year of the disheartening ordeal, a chance meeting with an abolitionist from Canada changes Solomon's life forever.",

Although he was accustomed with a freedom life, he worked hugely hard to help the other slaves who were highly injured by the farmer. He fought the absolutely courageous he could to help your trib.\n\nIf you have not seen 12 Years a Slave and you are looking for an astonishingly surprising movie from 2014, you will be extremely fascinating with this movie in all of the more than 2 hours of duration.",

Nevertheless, I'm glad this film won the Oscars for Best Supporting Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film. It totally deserved that. It's a difficult film to watch, but it helps people who are not black to better understand the brutalities of slavery. I read about slavery and the events that caused the Civil War during the eighth grade, and I read more about African American history during the ninth, tenth, and eleventh grades. But that's more of an academic exercise. This film makes you despise slavery on a visceral level, and you want Solomon to escape from it. You also have sympathy for Patsey and wish she could have escaped, too. Her story is heartbreaking, and you can see how Solomon was traumatized not only by what happened to him but what happened to her, since she was like a daughter to him. More people should read 12 Years a Slave, and I did because of this film.",

The directing never shies away from the difficult moments, leaving shots to linger for far longer than feels natural. One minor complaint is that sometimes this is less emotionally impactful and more boring - especially when the shots are of characters watching or processing the difficult events instead of showing them to us directly.\n\nFrom the moment the movie starts, its title gives you the feeling of hopelessness that our protagonist shares. The emotional moments hit very hard and it's very interesting to see the various attitudes regarding slavery from all of the characters - some are purely antagonistic while others are sympathetic in words but not so much in actions. It makes for a very powerful and relevant experience.",

The film is also masterfully directed with some of the most powerful scenes coming from meditative shots of actors visually displaying what their character is feeling. Where some films I\u2019ve reviewed seem long and drawn out, this film\u2019s runtime feels earned, truly immersing the viewer into the terrible tragedy it\u2019s protagonist had gone through.

It could have been truly extraordinary, but it wasn't quite despite having individual elements that were that adjective. Can see though why it has been so well received, while also seeing where those who didn't like it are coming from in their reservations (though not sharing the vitriolic way they've been expressed by some). It may not be perfect, but from personal opinion, and quite a big number of others, it was tremendously powerful and very brave,\n\n'12 Years A Slave' may have some one-sided and conveniently black and white characterisation. It may not say anything new about the subject.\n\nSome of the cast, like Paul Giamatti and Benedict Cumberbatch (though they are excellent still), are underused. And Brad Pitt and his dialogue did feel out of place and the dialogue additionally coming over as heavy-handed.\n\nOn the other hand, to tell the story from the viewpoint of the enslaved was a brave decision in an industry where few films have done it, and it comes over very well on the whole. The treatment of the slaves is not for the faint-hearted, they are shockingly harrowing and not comfortable to watch but they don't feel that gratuitous. There are some emotionally devastating moments, such as the ending and the long shot of Northup singing.\n\nSteve McQueen was the right director for the film, a film that needed to be told in a brutal and honest way and being a director with that directing style McQueen brings that out perfectly in a bravura directing job. '12 Years a Slave' is very impressive visually and technically, and Hans Zimmer's score is suitably stirring.\n\nJohn Ridley's script adapts Northup's memoir with tautness, honesty and sincerity, not subtly mind you but it's not a subtle subject. It only falters with Pitt's dialogue.\n\nThe acting is superb, with Chiwetel Ejiofor's powerfully restrained and sincere performance wholly deserving of its acclaim. Lupita N'Yong'o, very moving, and Michael Fassbender, at his most frightening, are more than up to his level, as are Sarah Paulson and Paul Dano.\n\nOverall, extraordinary it isn't but an emotionally impactful film it certainly is. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The two films are relatively similar in that they involve two huge films with talented ensemble casts telling stories directly relating to slavery in the Antebellum period. Admittedly, they belong to different eras, but the two are comparable. Strangely, Chiwetel Ejiofor is also in both. Where Amistad rings false and clearly exaggerates and embellishes the roles of individuals such as John Adams to showcase the talents of the cast and feed the Hollywood audience standard cinematic fare. 12 Years a Slave, with Ejiofor in a more main role and Steve McQueen at the helm, could hardly feel less different.\n\nThis film is extremely raw. Every single performance involves the greatest care. Ejiofor does outstanding work, but the supporters all perform superbly. Fassbender and Nyongo'o are undoubtedly the highlights. We see brutality in many slave and race-themed narratives, but this film ensures that this violence is never by-the-numbers or a half-hearted necessity. The audience feels Solomon's hopelessness and the hopelessness of all around him, although this is a double-edged sword. The film does drag at points where not much happens. The climax comes and goes without us realising, but this is again both good and bad. Perhaps the structure is not pleasing, but this assists the film in displaying the rawness and reality that it strives for. \n\nThe scoring of the film by Zimmer and others noticeably elevated the film. Some elements of the reoccurring background piece reminded me of Inception's Time. The cinematogaphy was also superb. Just two more positives in a very good film.",

Solomon is one of many black men that have endured and suffered way too much for far too long. Therefore, his brave story finally got told in this sheer narrative craftsmanship: 12 years a slave. \n\n\nSolomon went from a musically, habitual daily life to twelve years of unimaginable slavery. Even with the necessary documents that prooved he was a free man; he could not prove his right to be free and got framed. During these twelve years of being a slave, he got no free passes and had to deal with the hard labour, the whips, the absence of his family and much more. A free man, who could not even choose where he stood.\n\n\nOver the years, Solomon got to meet many slaves and free people. Naturally, he looked at them as his hope to freedom. However, every time he wanted to trust someone, there was always more chance to add insult to injury rather than opening the doors for his freedom. It was a little typical that Brad Pitt in his cameo, was the white man that came up for the injustice around him. On the other hand, we have William Ford. He was more of an example of someone that was between accepting the irrational voice of the white supremacy and coming up for Solomon. Though he was a helping hand towards Solomon on a few occasions, even if it was as little as a helium atom.\n\n\nThe element of nudity was elevated to a new height. The mere fact that the black people in this movie got sold and whipped naked is striking. Instead of nudity \nbeing used as an erotic factor or a comedic one, it was used as an important detail to help us understand the inhuman things these people had to go through a little more. \nThe writer wanted us to observe every detail of the black history. Completely naked in a human selling gallery that separates calves from their parents, their family and homes. A place that divorces you from your right, breath, sense, alternatives and soul. It was hard to watch it without crying or having goosebumps. (SPOILER ALERT) But at long last, his story didn't get down in infinite flames. Solomon survived.\n\n\nThere are always things that we want to change about movies. Like a happy end or a sanction for the bad guys or maybe a scene that could repeat itself as if we never saw it, so we could feel the happiness of that moment again as if it was the first time. I wish like nothing else to change things from the movie. To add justice and punishments, but unfortunately it was a true history. Yet: \u2018There are no menus, you will get served what you deserve.' \nIt is to us now to learn from these horrifying actions made against these black men, so we can never roll in a time like that again.\n\n\n\n\nSteve McQueen is a brilliant mind, and he told this story to the best of his ability. He got praised with an Oscar which he rightfully earned. He made a piece that was hard on the nerves, a piece that summoned a lot of emotions while watching it. Even with racism still being a huge problem in today's society, it is with certainty that I can say that every person watching this movie was cheering Solomon on and hoping for his freedom. And eventually\u2026 he was once again, a free man. A free man by                       his persuasion against immorality.",

The performances all around are phenomenal; Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita N'yongo, Sarah Paulson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt, the list goes on. Also, the direction and the camerawork is flawless. I do have one very small issue with the film, and that is the fact that it doesn't feel like a span of 12 years; it felt more like a couple of years. But, that is a such a small thing in this incredible but depressing look into slavery. It's not an easy watch at all, but if you haven't seen this movie, do so.",

            "content": "Based on a memoir, 12 Years a Slave follows Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) an African American free man who is kidnapped in Washington DC and sold into slavery. He ends up in plantations in Louisiana where he gets forced into manual labor by Edwin (Michael Fassbinder) and Mary Epps (Sarah Paulson) for twelve years until his freedom. I'll summarize what I adore about the movie in one sentence: Ejiofor, Fassbinder, Pasty (Lupita Nyong'o), the historical accuracy, the brutal violence, the costumes, the production design, and the unexpected ending where Solomon connects to his long-lost family and connecting to his grandson. However, as good of a movie 12 Years is, the cinematography is hit-and-miss, containing every director's favorite shot: the long take. I get that Steve McQueen is going for a candid approach, resembling the pre-Civil War photos in the Southern plantations. Some moments, such as one where Solomon survives a hanging or when Patsy gets whipped in the nude, are poignant, but others, like when he gets captured and whacked in the back, could have had some graphic candidness or gruesome discomfort, maybe like Schindler's List with its documentary-like camerawork. On top of that, Brad Pitt's cameo near the end comes off as self-indulgent, considering his humanitarian reputation and his producing credit. Also, his character Samuel Bass was flat-out unnecessary and served more as a deus ex machina and symbolic evangelical prodigy rather than a human being. Couldn't Solomon's rescue have had more levity, and arguably less egotism, if it happened arbitrarily, without revealing who set him free? Beyond that, 12 Years a Slave is probably the most brutal and honest depiction of African American slavery I've seen in a long time. \n\n(4 Bars of Soap out of 5)",

Ejiofor is the main character as he is kidnapped into slavery when he is already a free man. The memories of his family keep him going. This leads to many brutal and violence episodes from many whippings and hangings. The director does not flinch in what is seen. The language is very offensive and sets the scene on a horrible period of human history. One scene as we see Ejiofor chained in a room and the camera pans to show the white house. A clever scene which almost feels like the American government do know and should have stopped this earlier. The location and cinematography are well done, with the gorgeous landscape from where the slaves are working. The whipping scenes are very harsh and very long. You can feel the hurt. Its shocking and i admit i did look away. The anguish on Ejiofor's face throughout the movie shows as he is willing to live not just survive. Once is finally taken from the plantation we know its just one man and there are plenty of lives that still are not free. Fassbender's character is a very angry man and his acting is unflinching in its power to shock. His constant use of i can do what i like with my property does make me think how wrong this was and still is. I very well made movie, which is very bleak apart from the ending.",

            "content": "\"12 years a slave\" is a beautiful movie with a very controversial topic that will provide you a change of perspective. It has a powerful and ferocious story that kept me excited all the movie. I think the scriptwriter (John Ridley) made a wonderful job because he knew that not all the things can be expressed by words, he knew that if he takes care about the silence he also could make a good movie.\nAnother aspect about the movie that get my attention was the music. It was composed by Hans Zimmer and performed by Tim Fain. In my personal opinion, it has a beautiful mix between classic pieces and Western Music. This team knew that not everybody likes western or classical music, but they create an interesting combination where the people could enjoy both of them. I was waiting for the next song, enjoying the combination between this types of music that I thought it had nothing in common.\nNow, please let's talk about the cinematography. Sean Bobbitt made an excellent job. He made an historical film but he did not use an historical equipment. With beautiful locations and high tech, he recalls this infinite lands in the antebellum.\nWe know that this movie takes a lot of awards including Academy Award for Best Picture on 2013 but I think that this movie exceeds the Oscar's because it is a movie that not only amuse the viewers but also the people would learn with this story and remember how beautiful and rude can be the world at the same time.\nI only have to say that you should watch the movie.",

You will definitely hate some of the characters during the movie, especially the slave owners and sellers. Michael Fassbender delivers an outstanding performance as the brutal slave owner Epps, who treats his slaves as actual property. This movie was very entertaining to watch as well, you are always wondering what is going to happen next! Excellent movie!",

            "content": "I wasn't looking forward to seeing this film despite it's worthy subject and the array of talented actors who worked on it because I hadn't enjoyed director Steve McQueen's previous film Shame (2011). I have some of the same problems that I had with that film that I do with this, it's overly self-conscious in it's execution and doesn't have a clear point of view, but this is a significant achievement in terms of how it's shot and the ability to subvert it's genre that it possesses. This is a much more deserving Best Picture winner than The King's Speech (2010) and The Artist (2013) but I think that far more interesting, current films were released in 2013 that were more deserving of critical praise.\n\nSolomon Northup, Chiwetel Ejiofor, is a free African-American living with his family in Saratoga, New York in the mid 1800s as he works as a violinist. He is tricked by two white men who kidnap him and sell him into slavery under the pretense of providing him with temporary employment. He works as a slave under two different men, the cowardly but relatively sympathetic William Ford, Benedict Cumberbatch, and the cruel, brutal Edwin Epps, Michael Fassbender. He faces incredible abuse from both men and watches other slaves face equally horrible treatment as he tries to find a way to get home.\n\nThe novelty of seeing a film about the struggles that African-Americans face from the perspective of an African-American shouldn't be so great but with Driving Miss Daisy (2019) and Green Book (2019) also having won this film's attention to that viewpoint is positive. My issue with the viewpoint is that Northup isn't a particularly interesting main character as his home life, his motivation for staying alive throughout the film, isn't built up that much at the beginning of the film and he is mainly a bystander to the unfortunately more fascinating action involving the evil white slaveholders. It's not that he's a terrible main character we still feel for him and it is an emotional moment when he is reconciled with his wife and children but with a film that feels like a historical epic you expect a main character as compelling as Scarlett O'Hara or Captain Benjamin Willard. \n\nMcQueen does a great job as director as he makes the decision to use a lot of lingering shots whether to show the unrelenting brutality of the situation or the disturbing willful ignorance of the slaveholders' relations. The scene in which Northup has faced an attempted hanging, stopped by another man, but remains hanging, his feet stumbling across the marshy lands below him while women languidly engage in everyday pastimes around him. The horror of his situation and his utter hopelessness to stop it as even the more gentle white southerners refuse to help him felt honest and viscerally emotional in a way that few films that approach the topic do. \n\nThe cinematography is fabulous as Sean Bobbitt contrasts the incredible beauty of the Southern environment with the harshness of the treatment that the African Americans receive. Watching the beautiful Sarah Paulson stand serenely in a billowing white dress in the morning light watch an African-American be brutally whipped by her husband, having done nothing wrong, while having no response is horrifying. At times the film feels Terrence Malick-like as he pauses the progression of the film to take beautiful shots of the wind blowing the willow trees or the sunset flashing on the stalks of the plants. I stopped at times to simply marvel at how beautiful the film looked but not as though I was so disinterested in the film that I needed to focus on something else but because I was impressed by the scenery.\n\nI appreciate this film for what it does and some of what it tries to do but it didn't pack the emotional punch for me that I felt it should have if better executed. In terms of 2013 films I would say that The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) was a better, more memorable film than this one and a more deserving Best Picture winner. I didn't expect to get as much out of this film as I did but it wasn't on the level of Schindler's List (1993) or even Beloved (1998).",

That being said though, while the story is captivating, I had issues with the screenplay, which was slightly inconsistent in areas and in others a little (just a little) too drawn out. Other than that, though, McQueen did a great job with the direction, and the ensemble keeps everything together. Ejiofor and Nyong'o are great and emotion is written all over their faces, but for me at least, Fassbender was the star. To think that such a naturally good guy could transform into such a wicked, condescending jack-ass blew me away.",

The first scene where he is beaten shortly after getting kidnapped is brutal. Chiwetel Ejiofor (Solomon Northup) is outstanding in the lead role. He\u00e2(TM)s powerful, emotional, and we can rally behind him in the toughest of times. Lupita Nyong\u00e2(TM)o (Patsey) gives one of the best supporting performances I can recall. She\u00e2(TM)s incredible. The scene where Solomon has to whip her is barbaric, heartbreaking, and hard to watch in the best possible way. Michael Fassbender (Edwin Epps) and Benedict Cumberbatch (William Ford) are both great in completely different ways, while Brad Pitt (Samuel Bass) does a lot in a small role. The cast is really something special. Steve McQueen is excellent as the director, capturing every emotion that was needed to make this story work. The screenplay allows for plenty of room for big moments to breath and for key scenes to develop without much dialogue. I lastly want to commend the design of everything. As noted, this film captures exactly what it needs to. From the costumes to the sets to the tone, it all works. \n\nWeaknesses: There are several times where the movie feels like its dragging its feet. There was definitely at least a few things that could be cut. Just around two hours would have probably been ideal. However, I do think an extra scene or so was needed to really establish the relationship between Solomon and his family. It would\u00e2(TM)ve really added to the drama.",

It is a touching story that will engage you until the end, infuriate you at the injustice he faced, and enrage you at the general apathy or purposeful cruelty of white people. 12 Years a Slave is more than a film, it is an important historical depiction of an often forgotten aspect of slavery's atrocities. You will learn something while also being enthralled at the monstrous way white men and women treat black people.\n\nSteve McQueen's direction is fascinating. He does not hold your hand and explain each detail, but rather forces you to watch it all unfold as it dawns on you what has happened. McQueen uses intimate close up shots to display the agony and despair slaves felt with a sincere tastefulness without showing too much violence to reach beyond the pale. This is not torture as entertainment, but a recreation of real events to educate general audiences about the illegal selling of slaves by capturing free men and women. McQueen takes the natural surroundings to make real settings, period accurate clothing and accents, and detailed cinematography to optimal empathy. After all, 12 Years a Slave is essentially about empathy. We need to see these crimes in order to understand the depths of depravity that humanity is capable of without good people to stand against their racism.\n\nAmong all the excellent acting in 12 Years a Slave, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Lupita Nyong'o give all time brilliant and passionate performances. They make you feel such profound sadness while watching 12 Years a Slave. They deserve all the praise they have received for their respective role.\n\nOverall, 12 Years a Slave will be looked back as an upsetting classic of cinema. Yes, it is hard to watch. Yes, it is disturbing. Yes, it is important. Finally, yes, it is true. Give 12 Years a Slave your time.",

            "content": "MARY POPP?NS, THE GOVERNESS THAT CAME FROM HEAVENS\nThe umbrellas with long handles that we use when it rains cats and dogs always remind me of Mary Poppins' umbrella. If someone asks me now, if I would like to go on a journey with Mary Poppins, I would be like a kid in a candy store. Articulating my feelings, \"Saving Mr Banks\" tells the origin story of Mary Poppins and presents behind the scenes of the movie. Frankly, this movie flies me off to all new and different realms. Like me and Mary Poppins never left each other's side throughout the film. \nI think there's not one soul amongst us that doesn't know that arrogant and well-disciplined governess Mary Poppins, who flies using her enormous black umbrella. We get to know Mary Poppins, who has a wardrobe reminiscent of a regular 19th century English woman, as a super hero coming from heavens with dark colored clothes and a gigantic hat. In fact, what identifies Mary Poppins is the coal black umbrella of hers. Chosen as a \"metaphorical\" symbol of the gloomy rainy weathers of England, black umbrella is an important element that we identify Mary Poppins with. In reality, Mary Poppins is a very special person, because she has her own unique feature. She can tidy up a messy room just with a finger snap, she can fly and she can take out enormous household goods just from her small handbag. Having children under her spell with her magical powers, there's no impossible for Mary Poppins. \nNow, picture all this before your eyes! If you could manage to do this, we can continue to how Mary Poppins have been realized. Based on a true story, Mr. Banks shows us the behind the scenes of this Disney classic and tells us the story of the unstable relationship between legendary Walt Disney and author P. L. Travers. When his daughters persistently asked him to shot the film of their favorite book Mary Poppins, Walt Disney promised them that he would, but he didn't realize at that time that keeping his promise would take 20 years.\nTHE MERGENCE OF MAIN AND SIDE STORIES \n\nConsist of the merged main and side stories, \"Saving Mr. Banks\" shows the inner world of the author Travers perfectly. While we're already talking about main and side stories, we should give details on these subjects. Within the side story, we watch \"behind the scenes\" moments of Mary Poppins and within the main story we watch the relationship between the author and Walt Disney. For example, when a 'flashback' cuts in, we see the \"behind the scene\" enactments of Mary Poppins. Besides, these enactments consist of phantasms and reality intertwined. Well then, how does phantasm and reality intertwine? Let me answer this immediately. Within the scenes, where phantasm dominates, Travers imagines the scenes that will be shot. Telling us the events happened between 1906 and 1965 from his own point of view, the author reminds us that we're watching a \"film within a film\". He already is the eyes and ears of the film! In fact, having us identify ourselves with Mary Poppins, Travers reminds us Poppins' umbrella by using the \"rain provides life\" cue. Another detail is that the relation between object and character is as right as rain.  For example, there are Walt Disney toys in Travers' hotel room. Eh, at the end, the movie was being produced by Walt Disney! But what impressed me most is that director John Lee Hancock, who uses vivid colors, turned the scenes, shot in 2:35:1 cinemascope format, into a visual feast. This visual feast reflects the beginnings and the middle of the 1900s so good that you want the time machine has already been invented, so that you can travel back. The movie, really, embraces us and due to its strong aura, all the scenes become engraved on your mind.\nTRAVERS' EXPERIENCE\nLet's cut to the Travers' experiences, which is the main theme of the movie. Sometimes, Travers' anger and dissatisfaction raise difficulties for the production. Because the author always worries about that the film won't be able to reflect the essence of the book. For me, the most important thing is Walt Disney's 20 years long perseverance to keep his promise to his children. But it looks like, the life Travers led let her down so much that she can't shake off all her bitterness and bad temper. The most obvious evidence of the bad temper of rebellious and delirious Travers is the lonely life she led. In fact, she was so lonely that Mary Poppins was her only friend. Actually, was not this the only reason for Walt Disney to pursue Travers? Actually, the most interesting part of this story is the \"Mr. Banks\" character which was inspired from the deceased father of the writer. May be this is the reason of her bitterness. Who knows? In general, Travers' conversation with Walt Disney's toy may be the sign of the loneliness and dissatisfaction of the writer who has chosen solitude after all she has been through. Because, used as a metaphor, the Disney toy makes all the problems, buried deep inside Travers' personality, burst out. According to our analysis, Travers either postponed these problems or enshrined her own loneliness into her heart. \nMARVELOUS ACTING AND SOME GAPS\nWhen examined superficially, the perfect storyline and the marvelous acts of Emma Thompson, who plays Travers, and Tom Hanks, who plays Walt Disney, make a cold fact appear before us. According to that cold fact, what we watched on the screen was multi-layered; and we get aware of this fact only at the end of the movie. The message is so deep that it's hard to forget all along our life; because, maybe we will never watch another movie that teaches a powerful humanity lesson. However, it wouldn't be right to finish the article without making this small critic: I think it was a bit irrational to show Colin Firth, who plays Mr. Banks, whose also gives his name to the title of the movie, within so few scenes. Hence it looks like something outweighed. And also, even, incorrect portrayal of Mary Poppins' character within the scenes that show the behind the scenes moments of the original film tops it all. I wonder why they didn't put any scene that shows Mary Poppins flying with her umbrella, which is a token of her identity? It's hard to find a logical answer. It seems like, the behind the scenes was a bit mediocre. There could be more details. \nIn a nut shell: Even there were some faults, \"Saving Mr. Banks\" is a movie that can convey the feeling to the audience and become a friend with them successfully. In the last scene of the film, watching her own film, Travers cried so much that I also couldn't keep my tears from flowing. Especially the music playing in the background was like the blood travelling in our veins. I suggest you not to miss this film. Everyone can find a piece from himself/herself in this movie.",

            "content": "TRUTHS HURT\nI guess, it would be hard to control our tears, when we imagine the acts of the cruel individuals, who incorporate racism with violence. Then, what if this all acts pass before our eyes just like film reel? There's one thing to say; prepare yourself to the images you will see on the silver screen! \nDid you ever paid or forced to pay a price where you have neither any responsibility nor obligation? I'm sure we all did; at least once. But when that price is your freedom, then a line should be drawn there! Emphasizing the fact that freedom is priceless, the film \"12 Years a Slave\", which has Academy Award nominations in 9 categories, shows the different forms of the war between white men and black men lasting for centuries conspicuously. Steve McQueen, acclaimed director of successful movies like \"Shame\" and \"Hunger\", amplifies the power of the reality and vitality of the story by rendering his own feelings in. We should discuss this in detail. According to the movie and the proletarian dictatorship, the injustice and slaughter that enslaved black man subjected is a great crime. We can see that ownership instinct and hierarchical system have nothing to do with belief systems; the only reason is the \"poisonous ego\" of the humankind. We can relate the tyranny to \"poisonous ego\"; because \"poisonous ego\" makes all the depressed feelings within the subconscious emerge. Just like we see in the movie, \"12 Years a Slave\"... Now let's examine how the story of the film is told on the silver screen... \nSUCH A CRUELTY\nSolomon Northup is an African American guy, who lives in New York with his family and devoted himself to music. Solomon is a happy man with his freedom of choice. One day, he meets two men about a music job and goes to Washington to work as a musician. But the civilized world that he believed in turns upside down; those two men drugs and kidnaps him and sell to plantation in the South as a slave. The only thing, we can tell about the rest of the movie is that your tears will flow. Because all a slave's psychology subjected is suffering, torture and slaughter. Poor African Americans, the innocent victims of the tyrants! The beatings Solomon and the other slaves received are the reflections of cruelty. This heart-breaking situation may remind the audience of the Hitler's, Stalin's and Franco's dictatorships. Even the Jigsaw, with its torture scenes... Though, it can't be a patch on Jigsaw! \nTHE WAR BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL\nThere's no doubt that the center of this story of slavery war and personal freedom that happened 200 years ago is the protagonist Solomon, who was ossified with his ups and downs, fears, endurance and dedication to life, while he also defies it. Maybe this sorrowful journey of Solomon, who is a unique personality, is a bitter pill to swallow, but he reflects his inner light on everything that has happened and this constitutes the backbone of this story's naivety. The despair and unrecoverable anger, our protagonist feels, show the faith of the character drifted towards obscurity. We can identify this as the established form of pain and sorrow. Taking main character away from his homeland and beaming him to an unfamiliar place, a center of evil is throwing audience a curve. Here is an image of loneliness and despair! From this point, we can draw an analogy of Solomon like this: While the dark clouds cast their shadows over his life persistently, just like Rodin's famous sculpture \"The Thinker\", he loses himself far away in his loneliness.  No matter how depressing this scene is, having a strong character, Solomon doesn't give up and learns how to fight with his loneliness, come what may. In addition to this, beyond the struggle for life and the destructive psychological situation, he almost becomes the projection of a troubled life, with an attitude like he can control everything easily. The oppression created by this clash of clans and cruelty increases in daily basis and the unpredictable end that leads to worries us. As we are over-sensitive to this subject, the film made us cry, rarely got our hopes up, reminded us that above all we're human beings and thrown us into the hands of indescribable sorrow. \nREMORSELESSNESS AND AN AFFRONT TO HUMANITY\nFrankly speaking, along with this kinds of hurtful laws of the civilization, the effort of those remorseless people trying to cover their shameful activities as if nothing has happened, presents the essence of the story, which runs towards an inevitable ending. This remorselessness emerges to the surface once in some people, a few times in some and frequently in some and becomes the identity of them. Then, there's nothing you can do about that kind of individuals. Though, there is a saying as \"there is no end to the cures within democracies\", but it's hard to talk about the existence of a democracy within this example. The best example of this is the antagonist Edwin's (Michael Fassbender) usage of slaves as his own assets. The words coming from the optimist Canadian farmer (Brad Pitt), who always sees the glass half full, are: \"Everybody is equal before the laws, whether he is black or white. If you have been in their shoes just for one day, you would never act like this again.\" Emphasizing the importance of being empathetic with these words, Canadian, who has his heart in the right place, also underlines the need of the slaves to walk from darkness into the light. In fact, the reason why \"they bide, they're on their feet\" saying is attributed to slaves is that they never give up. Just a small light of hope would show everyone the meaning and importance of their determination towards life.\nMUSICS AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE COLORS\nNow, imagine that all these events of the story are backed with the music of a great composer like Hans Zimmer. Wouldn't be so motivational? Yes, you didn't hear wrong; the music of the movie is composed by Hans Zimmer. It's a clever move for director McQueen to combine Hans Zimmer's magnificent music with his 2:35:1 cinemascope images. As if all these brought the movie to a fourth dimension. Gluing the audience on their seats with his high quality cinematography, McQueen gives a lesson on what to shoot and how, by using all visual elements in their proper place, especially the objects that enters the frame. He fits the vivid colors, he prefers to use, via the natural spaces. By this way, the gaps within the script are also filled. But, it looks like filling the gaps was not enough to cover all the errors. For example, one of the most problematic errors that will annoy the audience is the length of the mise-en-sc\u00e8nes.  Sometimes these scenes are too long, but sometimes you ignore this problem, because of the wonderful performances of the great actors. As the phrase goes, the unforgettable cues of two great actors, Michael Fassbender  and Chiwetel Ejiofor, raise the bar for the film. And also we shouldn't forget an important detail; unique message on slavery from the producer of the film, Brad Pitt. \nAs a conclusion: \"12 Years A Slave\" is a fabulous film which wrenches our hearts, fills our eyes with tears, makes us think, gives a lot of messages and serves a purpose. It doesn't only examine the slavery problem, but it tries to cure a bleeding wound of humanity. And by never ceasing... I want to conclude my article by stating: \"We shouldn't hide the truth\"",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) All kidding aside, Scott, 12 Years a Slave is extraordinary.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Totally agree, Gregger. Quite a powerful movie.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free Negro living in Saratoga Springs, NY in the year 1841. While his wife and children are on a 3-week trip, he is invited by a pair of circus owners to travel with them to Washington D.C. and play violin in their orchestra. Solomon isn t long in D.C. when one day he wakes up in a cellar with shackles on his hands and feet.\n\nSCOTT: Solomon tries to explain to his captors that he is a free man from New York, but he learns the hard way that the more he speaks the truth of his identity, the more brutally he is beaten. He is taken by boat to the deep south where he must live the life of a slave. Some of his white slave owners are crueler than others. One particularly evil master nearly kills him, and he is sold to another who is just as bad. The entire movie portrays Solomon s attempt to maintain his dignity as he seeks to restore his freedom under the most horrific of conditions.\n\nGREG: Scott, this movie provides a vivid look at the inhumanity of slavery in the old South. It will draw comparisons to the Summer s The Butler for a look into the lives of how Blacks have been treated in America. The most compelling thing about this film is that it is the story of how a free man is cast into slavery. We see Solomon in his ordinary world, a full citizen with all the rights and privileges of any other man in his town of Saratoga. And literally overnight he is stripped of his identity and cast into a world where revealing that you know how to read and write could mean your death. The stark contrast between these two worlds makes his story at once chilling and compelling.\n\nSCOTT: 12 Years a Slave is hard to watch but it must be watched. Our ability to learn from man s inhumanity to man is very much dependent on our willingness to see and confront the very worst ways humans have treated each other. For that reason we must see movies about the holocaust, about genocide, about torture, about slavery. And then we must do everything in our power to ensure that these atrocities are never repeated. There are dozens of scenes in 12 Years as a Slave that portray horrific suffering, and the suffering is physical, emotional, and spiritual. There are scenes of brutality that are too terrible to bear, but bear them we must. Are these scenes over the top? If they were not true, perhaps so. But their veracity justifies their need to be shown, to be disgusted by, and to be learned from.\n\nGREG: The impact of this story is how we can walk in this man s shoes - asking ourselves  What if this happened to me? What if one day I woke up in chains with no way of getting home?  The concept of it boggles the mind. This is the strength of director Steve McQueen s and writer John Ridley s storytelling. They have successfully drawn us into this man s nightmare and made us feel his pain. Solomon s story represents a classic hero s journey. We meet him in his ordinary world where he is a free man. Then something terrible happens and he is cast into the  special world  of slavery in the deep South. He is separated from friends and family and must face enemies and make allies in this new world. The rules here are different and he must learn to maneuver in this strange place and learn the rules or suffer the consequences. The consequences in this case are the lash of the whip or even death.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, the casting in 12 Years a Slave is phenomenal. All the actors deserve kudos for their remarkable portrayals of toughness and strength, anguish and despair, hatred and love, heroism and villainy. Chiwetel Ejiofor in particular jolts us into the reality of enslavement and the tragic toll that enslavement takes on our mind, body, and spirit. Ejiofor most certainly deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. We see and vicariously experience the pain and anguish of the slaves. We are shown various gradations of evil among the white slave owners, who range from heinously evil and vicious, to moderately cruel, to empathetic yet still condoning of the barbarous system. There are also nuanced differences among the slaves, from actively rebellious, to reluctantly submissive, to utterly defeated.\n\nGREG: I don t think it s giving too much away to say that Solomon eventually returns home since the title is 12 Years a slave. When he does, he returns as the master of two worlds - the world of a free man and the world of a slave. We learn in the epilog that he goes on to fight against slavery as an abolitionist and member of the underground railroad. This is the fulfillment of his hero s journey: coming home with the elixir - the knowledge of what it is to be enslaved and the resolve to see slavery ended. 12 Years a Slave is as powerful a movie as any we ve seen this year. It s a painfully honest look at what it was to be a slave in the Antebellum South. It s one of those movies that we must watch so that we never forget and so that it can never happen again. I give 12 Years 5 out of 5 Reels and Solomon Northrup 5 Heroes out of 5. Movie: Hero:\n\nSCOTT: Gotta agree with you, Greg. 12 Years a Slave is a searing look at the worst form of human abomination, namely, the disgrace of brutal slavery. If you re not in tears when you watch the relentless suffering, if your heart isnt bursting when you witness the powerful final scene of the movie, then you have no human heart. This is one of the year s best films and I nominate it for our REEL HEROES Hall of Fame. It most certainly deserves the full 5 Reels as well as an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. And as you so aptly point out, it portrays the hero s journey most powerfully in its full form, earning it the full 5 Heroes as well. Movie: Hero:",

            "content": "Slavery has been labelled as one of the gruesome anti human process that led to the violation of rights of blacks. The movie, 12 Years a Slave provides an epic description of how slaves were mistreated. The development of 12 Years a slave from the beginning to the end is very effective with the theme of effects of slavery being brought out magnificently. The plot, setting, themes, and development of 12 years a slave all revolve around the issue of slavery and how it affected the societal arrangements. The review of 12 years a slave will be pegged on, themes, plot, character and the setting.\n12 years a slave is based on Solomon Northup's suffering as a slave. Solomon Northup was kidnapped in 1841 in New York and sold to slavery where he survives 12 years of torture and hard labour. The movie begins with a scene where Solomon Northup and other slaves are tendering sugarcane. The slaves led by Solomon Northup are mistreated in Sugar plantations even though Solomon manages to use his skills as a musician to gain favours from Master Ford (Northup, 2013). Solomon Northup was later transferred to the Cotton fields where he met the cruel Edwin Epps as the master.  Under Edwin Epps, Solomon Northup experiences new form of barbarity especially to the frail Patsy. Edwin Epps mistreats slaves and a number of them are whipped. Solomon Northup while with Robert exclaims, '' I will not despair, I will wait till my freedom comes'' (Northup, 2013). Consequently, Robert while talking to Clemens states, '' we cannot allow to be mistreated by Epps, we have to fight'' (Northup, 2013). The development of the story in this movie is highly pegged on the suffering of the slaves and how they developed a sense of rebellion led by Solomon Northup (Northup, 2013).\nThe Movie 12 years a slave tackles the issue of slavery appropriately. The cast develops the main theme appropriately with Solomon Northup depicting how the slaves were mistreated and Edwin Epps showing how cruel the slave masters were.  While talking to Mistress Epps, Edwin Epps states that, '' I will get rid of you before I go for Patsey''. This conversation gives the viewers of this film a sneak preview of how the slave masters were cruel to the slaves at the extend of threatening the lives of their own relatives (Li, 2014). The main theme is therefore vividly brought about by the movie director of this film. All the effects of Slavery have been shown with a majority of slaves suffering at the hands of the plantation owners. \nIdeally, the cast of 12 Years a slave is comprised of experienced actors who help in bringing out the themes and its intended purpose very well Li, 2014). Solomon Northup, Edwin Epps, Patsey, and Brad Pitt lead a star studded line up which makes 12 years a slave an exciting film that meets its mandate of tackling the issue of slavery and its effects. The inclusion of the best actors in movie industries gives 12 years a slave an exceptional touch which originates from the popularity of this cast in various films that they have been involved in. Solomon Northup demonstrates vividly how the aspect of slavery is rife in America with a supporting role from Patsey and other actors.\nTherefore, viewing 12 Years a Slave is recommended because of its demonstration that slavery was evil, an amazing cast led by Michael Fassbander, Brad Pitt and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Also, 12 years a slave manages to recapture what other movies have failed and this is incorporation of both societal, economic and political injustices to a fantastic cast.",

That's thanks in part of course to Chiwetel Ejiofor's oscar-winning performance, but its coupling that with the bravery of the filmmakers to go all the way that means things are as hard-hitting as they are.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Occasionally the delivery of certain elements take you out of it as the odd bit of sound design, cinematography and editing do bring the filmmaking a little too far into the foreground for its own good.\nVERDICT: A powerful, disturbing and brave movie that does what all about this subject should do; '12 Years a Slave' is a film that everyone should see.

It had the darkness, it had the torture, and all that awful reality of slavery. However it didn't dwell on it or feel the need to bombard us with it constantly. It was nice that the film respected the viewers enough to know that we already recognize slavery is repulsive. The only place I thought it needed something more was in the breaking of Solomon, because it almost seems he gives in without that much of a fight.\n\nThe acting is all spectacular. A lot of moments are told through looks and body language instead of dialogue. Chiwetel Ejiofor is one of my favorite living actors, and he did spectacular in 12 Years a Slave. My favorite of his costars was Michael Fassbender who plays a nearly insane slave owner. The interplay between these two guys is amazing. The only performance that didn't work all that well was Brad Pitt. His character came out of nowhere abruptly and was just too good to be true. It didn't flow with the rest of the film. \n\nI know there is a lot of importance in making films about slavery, because it's possibly the darkest part of American history. That doesn't make 12 Years a Slave enjoyable to watch, though. It was a drag having to fight my way through this movie and crying with it at the end. Now that I've seen it I feel no need to watch it again. I'm not criticizing anything, it's just a tough movie to swallow. It was made even more impactful when they revealed it was based on a true story. 12 Years a Slave is not my favorite type of movie, but it's one I'm glad I've seen.",

It is exceptionally cast, beautifully acted, perfectly paced and filled with strong moments. At the risk of contradicting myself, the only weak link seems to be Chiwetel Ejiofor's one dimensional acting that further oversimplifies the one dimensional character he plays. \n\nWhile the movie establishes a powerful connection with its above said strong moments, looking back at it might seem a little exploitative which tries too hard to add a sentimental value around every possible scene. However the movie is elevated with a near perfect performance by Michael Fassbender who epitomizes all the evils associated to slavery with his hellish expressions and some of his actions adding to uncomfortable viewing. \n\nSolomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free black man in the north who has a bumbling career, a comfortable home, loving wife and kids and respect in the society. His world turns upside down when he gets abducted, shipped away to the south and pushed to slavery without a means to contact his family or friends. He gets crushed into his own shell as his identity, skills and education becomes a threat to his life. His misery gets compounded when an unavoidable circumstance leads him to sadistic and volatile 'Master' Epps (Michael Fassbender) leaving his empathizing current 'Master' Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch). He is now called Platt, a cotton farmer and an occasional fiddle player who cries to sleep everyday ruing his fate and missing his family.\n\nWhile the movie succeeds in presenting the horrors and brutality of slavery, the USP of this movie lies in projecting the upliftment of human spirit where I think it failed to an extent especially with Ejiofor's single expression throughout. Another powerful performance of a tormented slave between her master's lust and mistress's jealousy as Patsey by Lupita Nyong'o commands a mention. But the showstopper performance is by Michael Fassbender as he evokes \"Daniel Plainview\" from \"There will be blood\" filled with ego, unpredictability and violent tendancies. The authenticity factor also take a beating a little bit with some 'A' list actors making a cameo around every corner.\n\nUncomfortable viewing experience but it falls short on achieving its ambition. Watch it for Michael Fassbender!!",

You do not have all of these combinations, and have a poor film to show. 12 Years a Slave, is a harsh, but a sadly true subject we've seen, and read before. But I believe, 12 Years a Slave is probably the most brutal, realistic view, evil, nightmarish, heart pounding tale of American slavery since the original Roots. American slavery was awful, and Solomon Northup goes through Hell in this film. Even though this film, and its subject matter can be harsh. It is a film to view, learn from, and understand the cruelty that happened to Africans in America. I believe this is a film for everyone to see and learn from, no matter what race, religion, or region you may be from. Director Steve McQueen (Shame, Hunger, uses the best filmmaking techniques, to demonstrate the unimaginable cruelty, our main character has to through, and how our main character has to not only survive but truly live. The acting in this film is so well done. In this movie, Michael Fassbender (X-Men First Class, Jobs)is the devil. Brad Pitt (Fight Club, Oceans 12) is a good man in a cruel world. Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story)really gets under your skin, and comes off as a bully. You really feel sad for Lupita Nyong'o, and our lead, Chiwetel Ejiofor (4 Brothers, Salt) truly is an amazing actor. There are numerous scenes, when he can literally tell he has been through Hell, with just looking in his eyes. In addition, the scenery of the South is very beautiful. On the other hand, the ugliness of slavery makes the film have a very interesting contrast. Overall, I believe 12 Years a Slave is a movie everyone should see. It is a good film, that conveys a nightmarish, evil period in American history. It feels real, organic, and it is an amazing film. I am more than proud to give this film a rating of 10/10.",

            "content": "The historical drama is a genre which has heaps of potential to evoke deep emotion and impact in addition to painting an often shockingly realistic picture of life in the past. With ''12 Years a Slave'' Director Steve McQueen (the British director, not American actor mind!) has created one of the finest examples of this and it's kicked off the 2014 year of movies superbly.\n\n''12 Years a Slave'' is based on the book of the same name and begins in 1841; a time when the slave trade in America was still very widespread and follows a man named Solomon Northup, a free negro living in Saratoga Springs New York. On a seemingly normal job offer as a musician he is kidnapped, stripped of his name and sold into slavery; from here it's a bitter struggle for ''Platt'' as he, along with other slaves, endures the varying torment and racism of white folk across East America. ''12 Years a Slave'' is arguably the most realistic and sincere portrayal of the slave trade ever put to cinema; acts of immense cruelty are scattered throughout the narrative, emphasising that a slave's struggle is never over, whether they are being stripped to be put on display or being whipped at the stake, moments like these will undoubtedly remain etched in your mind. In addition the film's pacing truly does highlight the enormity of Solomon's struggle; it's an incredibly slow film, often placing emphasis on Solomon's attempts to fit in and avoid provoking the anger of his masters. It's an impossible situation to be in and in keeping the pace slow, the prospect of Solomon being stuck like this for so long really starts to hit home. The plotline of ''12 Years a Slave'' can be summed up in one word, emotional; the slaves are never safe and the masters are always one step away from unleashing their rage. This persists through the entire film and the final scenes are appropriately throbbing with relief.\n\nWith such a tumultuous time period comes the need for a greater level of emotion from its characters and ''12 Years a Slave'' passes this area with flying colours, making the audience feel the suffering of the slaves while also making them hate their oppressive and often despicable masters. Chiwetel Ejiofor does a great job of channelling the immense sadness and frustration that fills Solomon throughout his ordeal but the action isn't always entirely focused around him; Patesy (Lupita Nyong'O), introduced later in the film, endures twice the abuse and suffering as any of the other slaves and is easily the emotional heart of the film, despite not being the main protagonist. On the other hand we have Michael Fassbender playing Edwin Epps; a nasty piece of work who believes his dominance over black people to be a God given right. Whether he's threatening Solomon or punishing his slaves, Fassbender once again delivers a brilliant performance, creating a fundamentally evil antagonist that the audience dislikes enormously. The other side characters are also well done with Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt lending their talents to more sympathetic roles in this grim setting; we learn plenty about them but they never overstay their welcome or distract from the main cast throughout the film.\n\nThe way ''12 Years a Slave'' is presented also makes a big impression. The biggest draw comes from the cinematography; often times the camera will focus on the face of a slave as they are brutally beaten both physically and mentally, or it will just sit there and let the audience stare at a particular moment for a while. These angles generate immense impact, emphasising the no-holds-barred portrayal of slavery and can also imply passage of time. Just as the plot proceeds at a slow pace, the camerawork does the same; when Solomon is hung from a tree, barely holding onto his life, you can tell that he has been left to hang for hours. When Patsey is whipped at the stake, you feel her pain with every lash. In terms of absorption and artistic quality ''12 Years a Slave'' is one of the best, but the positives don't end there. Using just three notes from a violin, the main theme of ''12 Years a Slave'', composed by Hans Zimmer is just as emotive as the rest of the film while other tracks relate to the time period and setting perfectly. Overall despite all the horrible events that occur, ''12 Years a Slave'' is a technically stunning movie from beginning to end.\n\n''12 Years a Slave'' achieves what it sets out to accomplish in a way few movies can; it draws you in, makes you feel the struggles of the characters, while offering an unrelenting look into the past at a country that was once plagued with unspeakable discrimination.",

Well played.\n\nWhere to begin with this one? There's plenty to be skeptical about- a giant Oscar-net! another film about slavery because, hey, that's entertaining! A chance for the fancy actors to do all of the fancy acting! \n\nOf course, all of those criticisms can be easily dismissed if the film is genuine. Now, that can be hard to define, especially when we're talking about something that consists solely of people pretending to be other people. So how then do I judge if a film is genuine? It's simple really- I don't. I watch it and if I'm drawn in, it has succeeded and if I'm not, well then, it can look forward to me badmouthing it on the internet somewhere. \n\nIt goes without saying that 12 Years A Slave completely drew me in. Not only that, but it had me from the get go and kept me for every second of its runtime. Through every scene, and every character, and every line, I was being affected by what I was being shown. \n\nThe performances are obviously key to this and there's so many to praise- Lupito Nyongo's stood out the most for me but Ejiofor is still tremendous and then you have Cumberbatch, Dano, and Fassbender just to completely confirm that Ridley and McQueen (and the casting director, I guess!) were absolutely not messing around with who they put in this film. Brad Pitt probably gets five minutes and, really, that seems about right. \n\nThe script is so finely-crafted however that I think it's the film's trump card. There are so many fantastically deep and convincing characters and their stories are so masterfully told in a way that is concise and yet somehow still completely generous to the complexities of each character. \n\nI'm always skeptical when a Hollywood film about slavery comes along because there's always the very-real danger that it will turn out to be nothing but crass historical exploitation. Were you to describe many of the scenes in this film to me, before I'd seen it, I would likely have cried that 12 Years A Slave was an example of such exploitation.\n\nHowever, that never felt like the case as I watched it. There was a purpose for every scene that related to furthering along the plot- to me, this became a film about the characters in the setting of slavery, as opposed to a film about slavery itself. To me, that made it all the more impactful as it successfully used these characters to make me think about what 12 years of slavery would really be like. I wasn't shown 12 years and left to stand cringing at all of the misfortune- I was deeply affected by it and that's what makes this film such a remarkable success.",

Platt was stripped of his name, his home and everything he had worked for. He was depicted as a slave after being an affluent violin player, something that is unheard of in history. He was thrown into a room, stripped of his clothes and dignity and challenged to ask questions. His commute from New York to D.C was of the typical slave exchange. Him and other slaves were put in a small room and made to stand and model-naked their best attributes, the normality for all slaves. Once on the plantation he was forced to work immediately, however, he was favored by his main owner...somewhat an oddity in slave history. On the plantation, the viewer was forced to see rape, the consequences of simply talking back and the self preserving lifestyles of the slaves- all of which cast exact shadows on the history of the United States. The clothing and living situations mimicked history exactly, as if the masters believed that less was more. However, of all the true depictions of history including the scene were Platt was hung and children were seen playing in the background as it was a typical day, some of the most eye opening opposites included Platt fighting back when his slave master made him strip, the favoritism that his owner showed him when he offered him a violin for his help with the rafts and the help that Master Ford offered to Platt when he was hung for bad behavior. Overall, the director Steve McQueen developed a genius depiction and heart pulling story of a man who was forced to rewind his success and become raw; from successful to stripped and then whole again.",

            "content": "One problem with movies about slavery is that, in order to portray its dehumanizing evils, there seems to be no way around dehumanizing its characters. \"12 Years a Slave\" (R, 2:14) manages to solve this problem. While making the lives of slaves look and feel more real than most portrayals of the subject, this film also manages to humanize the slaves' suffering - and underlying dignity - more effectively than I've ever seen it done before. Besides all this, the film educates its audience about a topic as well-known as slavery by showing a permutation of its injustice that has rarely, if ever, appeared on screen before. \n\nThis film tells the true story of Solomon Northrup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an educated, black middle-class family man who lived in upstate New York, until he was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South. He ends up serving two different masters (Benedict Cumberbatch and Michael Fassbender). The former is relatively kind and the latter is very cruel (but, interestingly, both are seen using the Bible - in different ways - to keep their slaves under control, one of the many ways in which this film smartly puts slavery's injustices and contradictions on full display). Solomon encounters a variety of other people who are party to his confinement and occupy various spots on the morality continuum (including brief but powerful performances by Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano and Brad Pitt). Solomon's intelligence helps him to survive, but does little to solve the problem of his captivity. It's not that he doesn't try to regain his freedom, but the system is so stacked against him that every idea he considers and every plan he hatches crumbles before his eyes, steadily eating away at his remaining hope of freedom.\n\nThe film's title makes it obvious that Solomon isn't still a slave at the movie's end. How that freedom comes about is the question (for those of us previously unfamiliar with the history on which the film is based). Does Solomon escape? Is he freed by a sympathetic master? Is he discovered in captivity by someone who knows that he was a free man? Does his freedom come as naturally as it did for millions of other slaves in the Antebellum South - by death? Whether you know the ending, figure it out during the course of the movie or just sit back and absorb the story as it unfolds, Solomon's experiences in his brutal and tragic enslavement, offer plenty to watch as we wait to see how these 12 Years will end.\n\nThis film's uniqueness in its depiction of slavery is brilliantly executed by screenwriter John Ridley and director Steve McQueen. Ridley's dialog effectively portrays the relative intelligence of his disparate characters and reminds us of the eloquence with which many Americans used to speak, sounding almost Shakespearean at times. McQueen makes the audience feel like they're part of the action by bringing his camera in very close at certain carefully chosen moments, and pacing the film in such a way that the characters' emotions become our own, including the very uncomfortable feeling of being off balance, not knowing what's coming next. The star's performance was so strong that, when the 2013-2014 awards season arrived, we all had to learn to pronounce Chiwetel Ejiofor, much as, one year earlier, we had to learn the name of the young \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" star Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis (who, interestingly, is also in this film). Although \"12 Years a Slave\" drags at times and stages its final scene rather awkwardly, overall, the film is a masterwork of story-telling and emotional resonance. \"A-\"",

It has been noted elsewhere, but it is actually somewhat shocking when one thinks of the general absence of films about slavery. Despite its cruel and horrific nature, the story serves well in the hands of Steve McQueen (director) as en effort to remind us of a tough history that still resonates today. \n\nThe story follows the true character of Solomon Northup, a man from upstate New York who finds himself abducted to the South and sold in to slavery. It is a story about his struggle to survive while also a stark picture of the reality that he shares with so many others. As the end titles fill in, Northup's story of survival remained an exception to the trend, and his investment towards changing this dire reality in the aftermath of reclaiming his freedom is equally deserving of the screen time the feature is unable to afford. \n\nThe cast is superb, with each character seeming to embody and symbolize a part of the Country's political and moral character. While Fassbender is memorable as the corrupt moral vision, the one who surprised me is the brief appearance of Pitt as Bass, a man from Canada who makes a dubious (and dangerous) choice to make a difference in the world that he sees. He is a reflection of a hopeful spirit, and in a world surrounded by horribly misguided opinions and abuses of power, he breaks through in a timely way to remind us that change is possible. \n\nIt is not until you reach the end that the cumulative emotional affect takes full root. Perhaps this is simply the time one needs to absorb the shocking brutality of it all. And yet the images stick and persist even when we find a break in the darkness to make the final scene loom over you with all the weight it deserves. The film is not a sweeping epic about a time in history. Rather it is something of a biopic that uses its specific concern for Northup to shed light on the intimate details that permeated and fed the larger issue of slavery in which he was immersed. This singular focus allows it to centre in and spend time on shots and scenes that otherwise might have felt the pressure of telling a more complete story of the Country itself. It lingers and hovers, and then patiently moves an inch, often in the wrong or negative direction. But even when it feels like it is not moving at all, the beauty in the horror of it all is the small movements to the positive, a stark reminder that Northup models for us as viewers and as people that change is possible, even when all seems lost.",

A mixture of a talented cast, a compelling plot and a wonderful cinematographer created a highlighted sense of reality. I am not a black, therefore I can't say I totally understand what slavery can do to humanity. But when Soloman struggles to keep his footing while being hanged by Tibeats, my breath was totally taken away. Along with nearly five minutes of that long, stead shot, I felt I was experiencing slavery from the first-person perspective. In this sense, both Solomon's pain and hope became mine. I came to realize slavery is evil in a sense that it not only brings pain and misery to the slave, but also brings out the bad side and dark nature in the slaver. \n\nFrom my point of view, the best performance came from Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyon'o and Michael Fassbender, their wonderful performance and wholehearted dedication took us on an emotional journey through the dark history of slavery.\n\nThough it is a great movie, but it still shares some shortcomings with other movies of the same genre. This movie took too much time to illustrate the cruelty of slavery which keeps people on their toes, but the problem is that the tension never lets up since Solomon gets kidnapped. It would serve me better if once in a while, we can get a moment of light relief away from all the depression and sadness, so we can better identify with Solomon's plight. After numerous representations, the incessant miseries almost become expected. During watching this movie, I actually felt a short moment of boredom.\n\nIs it just me or does the movie end too abruptly? It could have provided more details to describe how Solomon finally escaped slavery. Because after almost two hours of watching Solomon endure all the pain and hardship, it is difficult to convince me that he can regain freedom in only 15 minutes. I understand the difference between the time in movie and the time in real life, however it still gives me a feeling that Solomon's freedom comes at a cheap price.\n\nDespite all the disadvantages , watching the movie still gives me great pleasure.\n\nOnce again, I apologize for any mistake in my English.",

A free man in nth american, U.S. southern culture still having retained this eon's old triat of societies progress using labour. \n\nSad to defend it, if not be dam near illeeagle, as can be misdetermined as a matter of opinion of my own opinion upon the matter, justfully reasoned just not correct but alas. So this true recount worded in poetic fashion not unlike the dialect of English to the time. similar put to screen as the film  'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' this drull dioalog did not have the 'go to sleep' insinuating effect as there was really a lack of script to do so. you just have to pay close attention to the almost impeccable acting this marvelous cast did in the relitive nature to the translation of how it would have been spoken, then, biographed, then put to script then acted on screen. just a process of compliance but you can really get it doing all that overlook in you own mind.\n\nAgain a fantastic picture i thought if your in the mood.

I can't think of anything else to compare it to. This is one of those very rare cases where the movie fleshes out, enriches and deepens the book. The book has details of cotton and sugar-cane farming, the food and clothing of the slaves, the legal aspects of slavery, and the social structure along Bayou Boeuf that the movie could not get into detail about, but the movie makes the reality of 165 years ago COME ALIVE and get under your skin. It is an immersion, and you'll need a recovery period after the final credits roll. May God bless everyone involved with making this film. We cannot go back in time to the era of Solomon Northup and the people he knew -- real people, who really lived -- but thanks to the filmmakers, we may, in a small but powerful sense, share their experiences. For that reason, this movie is an incomparable gift to the world.",

            "content": "A harrowingly candid look at the pre-Civil war south, 12 Years a Slave is a profoundly evocative piece that meticulously depicts the brutal evils of slavery. English director Steve McQueen eloquently does justice to the source material of Solomon Northup's 1853 memoirs and his shrewd accounts of American's most vicious chapter. \n\nHoodwinked by two hustlers into leaving his New York home for a short term violinist job, middle-class Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is drugged and his paper proof of his free man status are stolen. Chained in a dank cellar and pleas for proper identification denied, his captors brand him a Georgia runaway, and proceed with the demeaning indignities that title entails. \n\nSold into slavery and transported to Louisiana, Solomon begins a life of basic survival. Unable to disclose the truth of his education or literacy without risking further persecution, Northup steels himself by assuming the imposed slave name of Platt and endures his hardship by forging genuine human connections.\n\nThe screenplay is skimmed down to Northup's experiences on two plantations; the first with a marginally kindly owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), who admires his innovations and recognises his musical talents, protecting him from the ire of a venal overseer (Paul Dano). \n\nThe second (accounting for over a decade of his enslavement) under volatile wrath of a particularly vicious drunkard, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). \"Distinguished for his faculty of subduing the spirit of the slave\" whose attention frequently and unwarrantedly wanders to an industrious young worker Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o), enraged his sadistic jealous wife (Sarah Paulson) regularly. \n\nWhile fellow slaves weep inconsolably or beg for the strength to commit suicide, Northup never gives in to hopelessness and is resolute that no matter how long it takes he will to return to his wife and children.\n\nA story of racism lived and survived, McQueen mesmerizingly plunges viewers into disturbingly vivid subject matter of state-sanctioned degradation with some graphically bold filmmaking choices. One scene that is particularly penetrating sees Northup dangling from a noose, one foot desperately scraping the ground as fellow slaves fain indifference and continue to work around him as noon becomes nigh.\n\nA character who is both an observer and participant in his own nightmare, Northup's complexities where masterfully expressed through Ejiofor, a dignified presence that is bound for Oscar contention while Nyong'o is a remarkable newcomer. \n\nThere are some minor directorial miscalculations, including the somewhat jarring casting casting of Brad Pitt and Dano as well as the somewhat artifice opposing stylisation of Northup's two lives above and below the Mason-Dixon but in the scheme, these are easily overlooked.\n\nThe Verdict: Claimed by some that with its marginally British cast and crew to not to be \"American\" enough, something about this movies takes you into Northup's cotton-picking hell, making you recoil at each movement of the cane whilst reminding us that behind one person's tale there are millions more untold that deserve the same treatment; an artful truth American directors are oft too close to capture without overt sentimentality. \n\nPublished : The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication : 17/01/2014",

Northup worked on plantations in the state of Louisiana for 12 years before his release.\nThis was a very well directed and acted film. It was also very difficult to watch at time.\nThe film deserved it's Best Picture Win. I think this film should be viewed by everyone over the age of 15 (any younger and it may become to intense for some viewers). It gives you a darker look at slavery and what these folks went through. It also shows you that no matter what nightmares we may be put through, the strength that we have inside will allow us to survive. \nExcellent film and ranked among my top 10 favorite period piece films. But again, I warn you, there are scenes that are very difficult to sit through. If you are easily bothered by torture and violence, then you may want to skip this.",

And, even fewer have told the story of a free black man who was then captured and enslaved. This is exactly what happened in Steve McQueen's '12 Years a Slave,' the Academy Award-winning landmark picture.\n\nThe life story of Solomon Northup is quite amazing, as seen in 'Slave.' Played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, the main star of the film shows a lot of conviction and perseverance, never letting his experiences get to him, and always trying to survive so that he can eventually get back to his family in New York. Along the 12 years he spends as a slave, Northup comes across a variety of characters, from conflicted slave owners like Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) and greedy slave dealers like Freeman (Paul Giamatti). And then there are those who are pure evil, like plantation master Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender) and his wife (played by Sarah Paulson). These antagonists underscore the terrible nature and attitudes of slave owners during this time, and their treatment of human beings like Northup is painfully demonstrated in 'Slave.' One of the most powerful relationships in the film is the one between Northup and fellow slave Patsey - a role that earned Lupita Nyong'o an Oscar for best supporting actress. The pain and sadness that surrounds Patsey tries to bring everyone down around her, including Northup, but he is able to overcome these challenges. And then, of course, Brad Pitt has a small yet important role in the film, as a traveling northerner who has a seriously crucial conversation with Northup late in his time as a slave.\n\nAs a film, 'Slave' runs a little too long, but that's understandable considering it needs to cover a span of 12 years. There are few scenes that feel like they are out of place, and some that are pretty difficult to watch, but make sense in context of the larger story. In this sense, McQueen does not sugarcoat anything here, which likely adds to the overall credibility and prestige of 'Slave.' In the end, '12 Years a Slave' is a story about redemption, forgiveness and committment, and it will be remembered as an unsettling yet powerful film for years to come.",

I'm glad I watched it. I liked certain things about the directing (like the fact that McQueen didn't plaster the movie with music) but the whole thing, the whole production, struck me as somewhat empty. There weren't those little details that bring a story, and especially a time period, to life. Life in the slave quarters, in particular, was lifeless. You can argue that that's because all the slaves were reduced to zombies, but I think it might be more a lack of imagination on the writer's part. In general I felt that where the source material didn't give any information, the movie-makers failed to fill in the gaps without resorting to cliche. I definitely want to read the autobiography now, though.\n\nIn a weird way it was like a melding of Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto (or however you spell it). 12 Years had the lingering sadomasochism of the Passion (Polansky proved you don't need to dwell on torture to make an audience feel it), at the same time it was a rousing survival story like Apocalypto. How can you not root for Platt! Every time he got his hands on some sneering racist villain I cheered! But I was disappointed in the end, because say what you will about Mel Gibson, he knows how to conjure up the weirdness of a different world.\n\nAlso, you gotta love how Brad Pitt, who produced the movie, gave himself the best white role.",

Oftentimes the movie is maddening, to see what humans are capable of doing to each other. The film also takes a look at the two starkly different ways in which the Christian religion was used in those days. Through the Scriptures, the slaves find solace and hope. Whereas the slave masters use it to try to control their slaves and justify their brutality. It helps you realize that people can and will use anything to justify their behaviors to themselves and others, and they don't need religion to do it. \n12 Years A Slave is about choosing hope over despair.

Being an individual whose seen many, many films and coming from a background filled with oppression and torture, I felt I was up for it. For about a year, every time I went to watch this film, people would tell me I needed time to think the film over when it was finished. A year went by before I finally saw it.\n\nI'll admit, I was rather impatient at first - I kept expecting to be overwhelmed from the start and I was becoming restless that my heartstrings weren't being pulled yet; but the movie helped relax that feeling. Delaying cuts where you'd expect them to be, it made the film feel so much more real - and that's a good thing because it actually happened. Masterful editing.\n\nAs the film goes on, the emotional tension rises as McQueen and the actors bring their A-game to provide a harrowing depiction of the life of Northup. \n\nThis film was pretty much flawless. The cinematography, the music, the sound design, the art direction... everything. I cannot praise this film enough. I need to give a big thank you to Chiwetel Ejiofor for his portrayal of Northup - it was freaking phenomenal. I haven't seen Dallas Buyers Club, but Matthew McConaughey's performance would have had to have been better than 99.9% of acting performances I've ever seen for him to have deserved it over Ejiofor, and I like McConaughey.\n\nWhen the movie was over it sent me into deep thought for a couple hours. I took a walk, wrote down my thoughts, and sat in silence. \n\n10/10",

Don't get me wrong the acting was excellent, but the story for me moved painfully slow. I was expecting to be moved and emotional but there were far to many slow periods that allowed boredom to set.  Although most will disagree the very small crowd that saw it with me (less then 10) did feel the same. I notice 2 people sleeping and one couple about the midway point for what ever reason walk out and not return.  I struggled giving this movie even 3 stars as for myself a three star rating means I will watch movie more then once, however I can't imagine ever being able to sit through this film again.

            "content": "Objective Subjection\n\nThe scarcity of film stock in 1920s Russia spawned innovations in editing. When a Film Professor intercut a poker-faced head-shot with highly-charged discarded footage, his students marvelled at the acting. Soviet montage pioneers also discovered they could lurk considerably longer on a distant shot than on a close up. \n\nSteve McQueen, a black Brit, does a splendid job retelling the cruelest, and perhaps the most troubling period in American history. The contentious subject alone makes it a necessary Oscar contender. A lot of slack available here. Regardless of the style, if the issue is treated with respect it will get respect. Anytime the movie lulls, the audience will inevitably meditate on history's horrible transgressions. Still, people don't go to the cinema to be shamed or reminded of past horrors. So stylizing the movie with foreign objectivity prevents it from getting weepy or sentimental. The complexion and complexness of the story is elevated by plantation owner Edwin Apps' (Michael Fassbender's) justifications. Slavery was legal. Period. Morality is not an issue. Don't blame him, blame the law. Just the way it's still apparently legal to kill Blacks in Florida with its disturbingly primitive Stand Your Ground law. The complexity in 12YAS is supplemented by Fassbender's overall bizarre, eccentric and exceptional behaviour. He even works the fields himself. His transgressions are further justified by deflecting much of the blame on his jealous wife, another marginalized figure. Subjugation is relative and hierarchal. The issue of slavery is even further complicated by abolitionist Bass (Brad Pitt) who, intentionally or not, comes off as a liberal putz. \n\nIt's a bold and powerful film all right, due largely to the subject at hand, if not McQueen's aloof presentation. The film gives us a formal study of callous persecution. It's framed with a stoic examination of impartiality intercut with readymade emotional content. McQueen at once immerses and detaches us from the human suffering constituted by American slavery. Notice how long he manages to linger on the hanging scene by shooting it at a distance. Lupita Nyong'o is nominated for an Oscar because her character suffers deeply. Her acting was heightened by basic editing techniques. Leave out the whipping scene or simply remove the shot of the deep, bloodied tracks lashed on her back, and she probably wouldn't be in the running. Similarly, the subject of slavery is so vexing and all-consuming that Chiwetel Ejiofor can play Solomon Northup entirely with detached resignation.",

I have seen many films that have made me feel something but the ones that have stuck with me over the years are the films I consider to be some of my all-time favourites. I'm still undecided whether 12 Years a Slave will fall into one of my favourites of all time but if it does it will only because of one reason...\n\n12 Years a Slave is based on a true story told by Solomon Northup the year is 1841 Solomon Northup is a free African American who makes a living by being a great violinist, he is well educated and what is very rare for that time he knows how to write and spell. Solomon is married and has two young children. One day he is approached by two men who ask him to join them in a trip to Washington DC to play a two week gig with his violin. Not long into the trip the two men drug Solomon and sell him into slavery. Solomon's name is changed to Platt by the slaver as well as where he is from which is now Georgia, he is sold to a plantation owner named Ford who looks after Platt quite well once he learns that he is a smarter than he lets on, unfortunately though there others who feel that it is their God given write to treat \"niggers\" as animals and go about doing just that. Platt is eventually sold on to protect himself to a malicious man Edwin Epps from here it's about Platt surviving anyway he can.\n\nAs I stated earlier this is a film designed to make you feel, and it does It so well, I guarantee you have a mix of emotions running through you from the opening to the credits and for me that is what makes an amazing film. The director Steve McQueen has only a few films under his belt but a whole lot of shorts and I fell he has done an amazing job, he hasn't done anything over the top its actually a very simple shoot. What he has done well is keep it simple, easy to follow, edgy and brutally honest. The beatings in this film can only be compared to \"The Passion of the Christ\" in their brutality and severity. The true heroes though are the actors, which I think every one of them have done an amazing job. Chiwetel Ejiofor (2012, Children of Men) is outstanding as Solomon Northup/Pratt, I can't help but imagine what the guy must have felt shooting some of those scenes he had to endeavour but either way he was amazing. Michael Fassbender (X-Men, Inglorious Bastards) was equally as amazing in his role, again I honestly believe he would have had nightmares after portraying his character he was very intense and so brutal. There are many other actors who all deserve recognition I think the entire cast should hold their heads up high for what they have accomplished here. I found it a little slow in places but not enough to worry really especially the first 10mins.\n\nThis isn't a feel good for humanity film, this is a film that will make you hate yourself, it'll make you think about that last joke you told, it'll make you appreciate everything you have today. It is a film that will make you heart ache; so get the tissues ready. To sum it up it is an amazing film for all the wrong reasons.",

But my biggest problem with Steve McQueen's film is the overall lack of style.  For the most part it is simply filmed and simply lit, and focuses on the actors over the rest.  It's disappointing in that sense.  However, the story is captivating and the acting at times is superb, I will grant it that.\n\n12 Years features the talents of a wide range of actors including Brad Pitt, Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Sarah Paulson, and the films lead Chiwetel Ejiofor.  But the films true stars are Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o.  The chemistry between the two was unmistakable however it's not the kind I'm sure you're imagining.  Fassbender plays Edwin Epps who uses Lupita's character Patsey as his personal play toy but his wife Mistress Epps (Paulson) isn't unaware of her husbands infidelity and takes out her rage quite violently on Patsey.  The resulting scenes are traumatic, especially a rather graphic whipping session that nearly kills her.  Fassbender is a scary presence in the movie and he steels many scenes from the other actors who seem to struggle to keep up with him.  Chiwetel Ejiofor seems to be the talk of the town lately for his portrayal of Solomon Northup, the man who the movie is based on.  He is fantastic, but I don't know that he ever went above and beyond as some of the others did.  Not to discredit him, he was amazing.  But it was just another aspect of the movie that left me underwhelmed.\n\nSo being underwhelmed by the acting, filming, and lighting you may wonder what I did like about it?  I will tell you that the writing is wonderful and Hans Zimmer's score is excellent.  The filmmakers achieved the telling of this story but just did it very straight forward.  I can understand it, but for me it wasn't enough.  There are very daring films made about slavery and oppression that push the creative boundaries further and further but 12 Years instead goes for comfort over taking risks and settles for a look and feel that doesn't suit what's happening in the story.  What does end up happening is the majority of the movie winds up being kinda stale and many scenes I found dragged and left my mind wandering.\n\nI'm realizing as I'm writing this that I have more problems than good things to say about the movie, but I want to emphasize that I didn't hate it.  I simply expected more.  When movies get the kind of hype as this one did it can destroy the experience of it as we all know.  I like to think I'm not effected by that, but who knows?  The movie is good, not great.  It's well written, well enough acted, and has a beautiful score.  The editing could have trimmed a bit, and the cinematography could have made better use of the sets and locations.  But there is still a good enough movie here for me to suggest it.  The fact that things like this happened in our not so distant past is haunting and the stories deserve to be told so I'm glad 12 Years was made despite the problems I had with it.  \n\nFINAL SCORE = 2/5 Bear Paws\n\nWest Fisher\n\nMovieBears.com, Las Vegas\n\nNevada Film Critics Society\n\nThe International Academy of Film & Television\n\nwest@moviebears.com",

Hunger was eye-opening, Shame was more than eye-opening, but it's 12 Years a Slave that finally and rightfully thrust him into the spotlight. An adaptation of Solomon Northup's memoirs, 12 Years a Slave is the shocking story of his 12 years as a slave after he is captured from his life as a respected free black man in New York. With a broad stroke of his artistic and visceral paintbrush, McQueen brings his best technical tricks to create the perfect atmosphere for John Ridley's character-based screenplay; extended facial close ups and long stagnate camera shots give 12 Years a Slave a level of artistic quality that has never been seen in a tale of American slavery. The violence is hard to stomach, but it's necessary violence that never crosses the line to exploitative, so please don't be deterred from one of the most remarkable and resounding films ever. McQueen has created something truly remarkable here; essential cinema.",

But this is a harrowing, raw, emotional, and powerful drama that manages to tell a tragic true tale that paints a harsh picture of a portion of American history, and does it in an artful way.  The cinematography of this film is tremendous, but it is the performance of Ejiofor that keeps you engaged from beginning to end.  The film says some strong stuff, yet it never feels preachy. Even the scene with Brad Pitt proclaiming that \"slavery\" is bad is actually more about the fact that it alludes that he could be helpful to Solomon's plight, and is less about the actual words he is saying.

As with all movies of this nature, 12 Years A Slave walked out to universal acclaim and ridiculously high ratings everywhere. I am pretty wary of this phenomenon. Just because a movie hits at a minority abuse point doesn't make it cinema gold. Films exist on a continuum and premises don't guarantee anything. That being said, 12 Years A Slave was an excellent movie. The acting was stellar and most importantly, no punches were pulled in the depiction of slavery. The scenarios are brutal and raw, really cutting to the core of the viewer. Ejiofor is fantastic, although those of us who are Serenity fans already knew this. Fassbender also offers up a top notch performance. The fact that this story is true just adds more weight to the movie. However, there are items that severely limit the longevity of this movie in cinematic history. Although Ejiofor and Fassbender are excellent, the performance from Nyongo'o was pretty mute, a surprising point considering her runaway Supporting Actress win. Pitt is pretty much in the movie just for awards appeal as well, an all too common occurrence that I find distasteful. I think the biggest thing that keeps this movie firmly at an 80% for me is how safe it played the game. As a whole, white and black people were fairly dichotomous in nature. One group didn't have feelings, the other did. There was a bit of talk about the psychological process of whipping slaves, but it isn't really fleshed out much and we don't get to see anyone grappling with it's effects. Cumberbatch, who offered an interesting paradox early in the film, exits quickly, which is a real shame. Pitt appears mostly as an Ex Machina figure, offering minimal depth behind his single major monologue. In conclusion, 12 Years A Slave does everything right, creating a film that is powerful, moving and right on target with current events. Unfortunately, it isn't a film that transcends itself, choosing instead to be content with ruffling no feathers and taking no risks. And what a shame that is.",

One day while talking to some white men, he blacks out and wakes up in a holding cell.  He is transported on a boat to the south and sold into slavery with some other free African Americans.  He is forced to perform unsavory duties and witnesses horrible things.  He hopes one day he can return to his family, but around every corner is the possibility of death.  Can Solomon escape, will he be rescued, or will he tragically die like so many before him? \n\n\"Tell no one who you are and tell no one you can read or write, unless you want to be a dead nigga.\"\n\nSteve McQueen, director of Shame, Hunger, and the upcoming Code of Conduct, delivers 12 Years a Slave.  The storyline for this picture doesn't have too many unique qualities outside of the kidnapping and is a fairly straightforward slavery movie.  The settings are well shot and the acting is definitely first rate.  The cast includes Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ashley Dyke, Kelsey Scott, Brad Pitt, Quvenzhane Wallis, Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, and Michael Fassenbender.\n\n\"He'll grow up into a fine beast.\"\n\nI was interested in this movie when it first came out due to its wonderful cast and high accolades it received.  I finally watched it on HBO and was fairly disappointed with this picture.  It was definitely well made, thought-out, acted, and written, but it was a frilly straightforward slavery movie with little new content other than how Solomon became a slave.  Overall, this is well made and worth a viewing, but far from a classic or worth adding to your DVD collection.\n\n\"All I ask is end my life.\"\n\nGrade; B-",

            "content": "Monday, October 20, 2014\n\n(2013) 12 Years A Slave\nHISTORICAL DRAMA\n\n Although there were many films made about the how African Americans used to be treated when slavery was condoned, I don't ever recall seeing a film that was ever based on a real life person before, since movies like \"Roots\", \"Sounder\" and \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" as well as other films about 'slavery' were classified as novels with some of it based on fact and fiction.   \"12 Years A Slave\" is probably one of the most accurate portrayals of slavery ever put on film solely because it's from the experiences by an actual person.   While we all know that slavery actually happened, and that we've always read about it, we had barely saw it happen to an actual person before, for much of it's history is only classified as allegedly circumstantial.   Which is the reason why it's the damning crux when it's possible historical events can be altered so that people who inflict these types of crimes can never be charged or held accountable for their actions- American law has always been unjust since it often doesn't favor toward minorities.  Adapted by a book \"Twelve Years A Slave\" written by Solomon Northup, directed by Steve McQueen who was synonymous for directing, \"Hunger\", it'd make sense that he'd be the one to be directing this film- he knows what pain feels like from the receiving end.        \n\nAt the opening, and at this point, Solomon Northup, played memorable by Chiwetel Ejiofor has already been captured and sold as a slave, but as he's already in chains lying down in a cargo ship, he's already revaluating how it all came about since he was initially supposed to be a professional violinist in Washington.  And for some reason we're seeing him in chains treated less than human as all the others who're not white.  Solomon is not like other African American slaves because he has already received the education he needed as opposed to his counterparts. For if anybody didn't know by now, it was 'once' forbidden for African Americans to receive the same opportunities as their white counterparts.  Which is why how some can see the irony whenever we see many African American children 'not' exploiting the education system, and instead chose a life of crime instead.  It is the character portrayed in this film as well as many others, many are not being recognized for the sacrifice they had to endure to get to this point- the right to vote as well as an education.   As soon as Solomon realizes that it's against the law for African Americans to be \"learning\" he makes some attempts to free himself by doing just that.  It's quite an unbelievable journey as he's moved from one plantation to the next.   Solomon does get his revenge by writing about this which if the opportunity was available, other people would have done the exact same thing, as a viewer I'm grateful that he did just that.   Winner of 3 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Actress for a Supporting Role for Lupita Nyong'o out of 9 nominations.\n\n3 out of 4 stars",

For example, instead of creepy music, we get the dramatic cues of the typical Oscar-winning drama.  This was really the only drawback for me. Director Steve McQueen already displays the terrible realities of slavery: the brutal physical torture (hard labour but also whippings, sexual assault, and lynchings) and the chilling psychological torture (being separated from family, not knowing whether to vie for positive treatment from the master and be judged for doing so by other slaves, the constant wish to take risks to escape). But if he'd treated this like Roger Corman did his Edgar Allen Poe adaptations, it could have been even more effective - although I'll admit it probably wouldn't have won the Oscar. Chiwetel Ejiofor is outstanding as the free Black man who is kidnapped and sold into slavery (with Benedict Cumberbatch as the kind but cowardly master who allows evil to happen anyway and Michael Fassbender as the just plain evil master). With McQueen's help, Ejiofor does show us the terror of the man in this predicament (amid the nicely rendered pre-Civil war environs), allowing us to imagine how we would feel and what we would do. The rest of the cast are excellent in support (including Alfre Woodard in a bit part and Lupita Nyong'o in a large but thankless one, deservedly winning an Oscar).  Still, cranking it up even further with the trappings of the horror film could have pushed this to the maximum confrontational level it deserves; it remains a humanistic classic nevertheless.",

The acting is amazing, the best in a while, and the characters are deep and well developed.  The cinematography is really good, it is well filmed, the only problem is how sometimes a single shot of let's say Solomon hanging from the rope for example, and the same shot goes on for literally over a minute of his sruggeling.

            "content": "This is the best movie of 2013. \"12 Years a Slave\" is without a doubt the most horrifying, true depiction of slavery ever put on screen. It definitely out beats \"Django Unchained\" by a long shot. Directed by Steve McQueen(not the actor) who also directed \"Hunger\" which I have not seen yet and \"Shame\" has definitely made his mark as the new face of directors in Hollywood. This is without a doubt his best film he has made yet, even though I have not seen \"Hunger\" I did see \"Shame\" and that's a movie that once was enough for me. Even though \"12 Years a Slave\" is a movie I could not see all the time, it definitely is a must see as this is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made in my opinion and I cannot imagine \"Hunger\" coming anywhere as close to this movie. This movie reminded me a lot of \"The Thin Red Line\" especially the way the cinematography captured beautiful elements of nature in the film the way Terrence Malick captured nature in \"The Thin Red Line\" it almost felt that at times it was Malick behind the camera, but I had to remind myself that this is Steve McQueen, a director with a fierce vision and a story only he could have told. And I am not just saying that because Steve McQueen is black, but who knows, maybe a white director could have captured the emotion and horrifying depiction of slavery that Steve McQueen captured on film, but in the end it definitely was suited better for McQueen to direct this movie as you can tell this was a personal film for him to make. The movie stars Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon Northup, a free black man who gets conned into slavery by these two white men pretending to be intrigued in the fact that Solomon is exceptional at playing the violin. They tell him that they would like him to come to Washington D.C. with all expenses paid and Solomon agrees. Afterwards they attend dinner together where Solomon is overwhelmed by the two men's generosity and so they toast on that which ends up to Solomon getting terribly drunk and puking outside the restaurant where they have had dinner and the two men tell him all he needs is a good night sleep and he will be as fresh and new in the morning. But when Solomon wakes up, he is in a barracks chained up and not understanding why he is there is the first place. He tries to tell one of the white men that come into the barracks that there has been a terrible mistake and that he is a free man, but the two white men don't want to hear any of it as they begin to brutally beat him till he falls to his knees yelling at him that he is a slave from Georgia. Chiwetel's character then goes from a series of events being shipped over seas on a ship and brought to another part of the states I am assuming it is somewhere in the south where we meet Paul Giamatti in a small role as the man who sells slaves to slave ranch owners and sell Chiwetel's character to Benedict Cumberbatch along with an African American woman who ends up being seperated by her kids which makes her weep terribly for them. Chiwetel's character does what he can to stay hardy and to not fall into despair offering up his talents to Cumberbatch and impressing him as he does it, but he doesn't impress Paul Dano's character who is a snot nose piece of shit young overseer of the plantation run by Cumberbatch and is as cruel as the next overseer. Throwing every racial slur he can and Chiwetel's character to try and demean him, Chiwetel is not at will to let this little punk push him around as there is a very cruicial scene where Paul Dano's character begins yelling at Chiwetel's character Solomon because he had asked him to put the planks for the house he is building just right so they look good and Chiwetel's character tells him that he has done so and that if there is a problem with the instruction then there is a problem with the instructor and this brings Paul Dano's character to become on fire as he tell Chiwetel's character to strip down and get on his kness as he unbuckles his belt, but Chiwetel tells him he will not. As Paul Dano tries forcing him to get down on the ground Chiwetel ends up throwing Dano on the ground and beating him ferociously as he deserves with his own belt. It's a scene that made he root for Chiwetel as he was doing it, forgetting though the consequences that will fall on Chiwetel's character after he is done beating Dano. After Chiwetel is done beating Dano with his own belt, Dano promises he will get him back and that he will not live to see another day as you know this will not be good for Chiwetel's character. Once another forsser walks over to see what is going on and Chiwetel tells him exactly what happened the overseer tells him to not run off the property as he cannot protect him if he flees from Paul Dano. After Paul Dano and two other men try hanging Chiwetel the other overseer who told Chiwetel to not run comes to his aid and tells Dano at gun point that he has no right to hang Chiwetel because he is the property of Cumberbatch. Dano is furious and tells the other overseer that he has no right to interfere before taking off himself. Chiwetel endsbeing let down but still hangs by his toes as the other overseer tries to find Cumberbatch to tell him of the news and tension that has just risen between Dano and Chiwetel. Once Cumberbatch arrives back to his plantation he cuts Chiwetel down and tell him later at night inside Cumberbatch's residence that he must send Chiwetel to another slave plantation for he fears Dano will strike again until Chiwetel is dead, but before that Chiwetel tries to tell Cumberbatch who he really is, but Cumberbatch cannot hear any of it. That is when he sent to the plantation of Edwin Epps played by Michael Fassbender who gives a riveting performance as the cruel and brutal plantation slave owner. It's terrifying performance from Fassbender an d without a doubt his best one yet. Fassbender has also recently worked with Steve McQueen in \"Hunger\" and Shame\" making them already a little bit of a DeNiro and Scorsese team. Fassbender is already one of my favorite actors to watch right now in Hollywood so it was amazing to see him play such a cruel and brutal character. The things Fassbender does to his slaves is unspeakable. And like Brad P[itt who also produced the film has a small role towards the end of the film, tells Fassbender's character that one day there will be a reckoning for what slave owners do to there slaves, but Fassbender thinks he is full of it. There is a scene that definitely will go down as one of the most brutal scenes ever captured on film where Fassbender makes Chiwetel whip one of the slaves he owns called Patsey played by Lupita Nyong'o who won Best Supporting Actress for her role which really comes out towards the end of the film, who we also learn is having an affair with Fasbender, but not by her choosing, who Fassbender goes nuts and thinks she has run away and brutally yells at his slaves asking them if they know where she has gone, but none of them know and when she does return she tells Fassbender's character that she went to get soap from the local store as she believes she is the one brings in the most cotton from the fields, twice as much than any other slave on the plantation that she has the right to be clean. Fassbender believes she is lying and forces her to be stripped and tied down to a pole where he forces Chiwetel to whip her because he cannot do it himself yelling at Chiwetel \"Strike her! Strike her! Strike her!\" It's a very cruicial scene to watch and after Chiwetel does whip her it is still not enough as Fassbender takes the whip from Chiwetel and whips her even more until she cannot stand anymore causing her to pass out. It's a scene that as I write this review can't help but think just how brutal we were to African Americans at that time and that it was more than a sin to what we did and that there are no words to describe the brutal actions that the plantation owners to did to African Americans in this film. It is a hard movie to watch, but at the same time you cannot look away as you are just shocked at what is being displayed on film, but this made me fell good in a way that there are still directors out there in the movie buisness who know how to make a good movie and Steve McQueen is one of them and I look very foward to see what he does next as this is without a doubt like I said before the best movie of 2013. Chiwetel gives such a commanding performance in the film as Solomon that we are with him to the very end of the movie. He definitely deserved the Oscar nomination that year for Best Actor as did Michael Fassbender for Best Supporting Actor as these two men gave commanding performances in both their roles. This is a movie to not be missed and a movie that speaks truth to what horrible things these slaves had to endure on those plantations. I believe i saw in an interview or read that Steve McQueen wondered why there were not enough movies about slavery and I don't know either, but I can conclude that it is because maybe people don't want to face the truth to how horrible the slavery era was and that people just can't face the fact that it happened and that it is America's sin as I believe I read in an article for \"Django Unchained\" or for \"12 Years a Slave\" I can't remember nut what I can gather from this film is that the truth hurts.",

Personally, it got to the point where I started to sit back and wait for the next extended cameo or Michael Fassbender to steal the show. The acting is very good, but it's almost a little odd seeing everyone in it, almost feeling like they're there just to say they were. The film does drag a bit around the middle and just like Shame, it feels like director Steve McQueen did some things for the sake of being shocking.

The one negative thing I can say about the film is the  unnecessary brutality at some parts and also how it drawn out. Sooner or later I felt like I've been here and done this for two hours already. Though the movie closes off with a fantastic conclusion to a movie that will leave you hating yourself...especially if your white. Though my ancestress weren't in America during slavery and basically Irish people were slaves years before blacks; you still get that terrible sense you did something wrong. You can take this badly or good. I choose neither. It paints a picture of what we (as whites) did to blacks, which is basically the worst thing ever committed by Americans, and gives it to us. It's a very well down movie and does seem to be one of the best movies of 2013. Overall it has some big flaws but rights itself in the end with a extremely emotional finale. 9.1",

The emotions and story unshakable; hours, days, weeks and 12 Years A Slave is such a film. From the moment the film opened on the first scene I was racked with anxiety. Not having read any reviews for 12 Years A Slave, I only knew it was fearlessly honest about the story of a free man from the North, kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nSuch clear purpose and vision could only produce a story of unwavering fortitude such as this. Steve McQueen, the director, is an artist and true visionary for his unflinching portrayal of Mr. Solomon Northup's story and the unending brutalities and injustices encountered by those in slavery. The knot that persisted in my stomach from start to finish is a direct result of his firm ability to never look away. I felt compelled to honor those who had endured such unspeakable horrors that were once their life by watching and also not looking away, likely Mr. McQueen's goal. From the moment Mr. Northup is sold, as Platt, you hopelessly seek out for some person to be a refuge as he fights to survive. The story is beautifully told, never allowing you to fully become immersed in the slave's life, never truly forgetting the freedom that was once had - with the use of flashbacks and remarks reminiscent of a previous life. No scene is wasted, no filler, no false emotions spurred from music, just the hard truth of one man's life. The saddest truth is Mr. Northup's story is unremarkable in comparison to thousands of other men, women and children forced and born into slavery.\r\n\r\nEvery actor deserves not just a nomination, but an award, to honor their brave and ultimately successful choice to take on such an insurmountable task of each role. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Adepero Oduye and the countless actors who I failed to list or those who played minor roles were impeccable and steadfast and a direct contributor to the movie's achievement.\r\n\r\nIf you are emotionally mature enough to endure such a dramatic, honest and truthful story then I implore you to set apart a day and watch 12 Years A Slave. A day is necessary to allow yourself to process such a magnificent film that is truly in a class of its own surpassing all other films released this year.\r\n\r\nI do understand if you do not, as the movie was incredibly difficult to watch.",

            "content": "2013 was one of the more Flotsam and Jetsam years of cinema that gave us classics like \"Gravity\" and real huge disappointments like \"Man of Steel\" all in the span of about five months. However, come Osar time, the film that reigned supreme earning the coveted Best Picture award was 12 Years a Slave. A film that originally appeared to me as another political tear fest of seeing how black slaves were oppressed and feeling bad about being white (don't get me wrong, I have nothing against black people but sick of the politics behind it all) actually has a deeper meaning here when you see the brutal torment of our main character, Solomon Northup, in particular that pulls the movie through as something to emulate as deserving of it's nomination and later victory in Academy Awards.\nThe film takes place in what is assumed to be the Antebellum South where Negro salves pick cotton and perform other grueling outdoor tasks for their white masters. Our main character is thrown into the mix while trying to prove he is free and getting no sympathy in return, being whipped and worked to death, told not to escape lest his life be not spared, and even being forced to whip a young Negro girl much to his heartbreak and dismay.\nThe emotions are crystal clear and the film totally engulfs itself in the experience of slaves at the time. If you are weak at heart, or any other weak constitutions, I suggest you skip this one. This is the uncensored abuse in full bloom, constant whippings, hot sun, grueling work, bitter cruelty, the whole nine yards. You feel the pain watching this movie, and I think that's the heart of this film. Which like I said works to it's advantage, but I do wish they focused more on the narrative. The first hour or so focuses on merely the experience of the slaves. They work, they sing (very nice singing), they have families, they feel weary and hopeless yet committed. And while that's intriguing, I got more invested in every scene that showed Solomon's struggle. He wasn't supposed to be one of \"them\", an aspect to this brutal story that would have made this film stellar to me if it was brought out more. He gets his redemption at the end, he has conversations about it, but everything else is drawn out around him that it's fighting for room. Another nitpick I have is the titles on screen that tell of the setting of the movie and what became of Mr. Northup after he was finally freed. The font was incredibly small, and illegible without a magnifying glass. Maybe it's just me, but that was really distracting. Fundamentally, this is a good movie, even if it's not your favorite movie of the past year. It's emotionally resonant and tones down it's agenda enough to grab a broader scope than perhaps originally intended.",

One day, two men offer him a job in Washington D.C., Northup agrees but once they arrive the two men drug him and he wakes up in a slave pen about to be sold into slavery. The film follows Northup in his 12 years as a slave with different kinds of masters and bearing all kinds of atrocities but never losing hope to see again his family. \nWith such a delicate and strong premise, this film needed a strong script, directing and performances in order to succeed as an artistic picture and fortunately has them. The first thing that needs to be call out is the outstanding acting by every single actor with the three nominated actors stealing the show:  Ejiofor is just amazing in the leading role, Fassbender is perfectly intimidating in his role and Nyong\u00b4o is just heartbreaking in her well deserved Academy Award winning role. But not only this film has amazing acting, it counts with a bold direction by Steve McQueen which give us long and hard to watch punishment sequences, striking visuals and the real misery the slaves endure enhance by the phenomenal acting; it has an amazing adapted screenplay that does the source material the justice it deserves, the story, most likely, gets some sentiments from the audience without using cheap ways to get some tears out of you, beautiful locations and a well done pre Civil War atmosphere.\nA deserved winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture, a film that will hook you and will make you cheer and/or cry by the time the credits roll thanks to its direction, script and spectacular performances but is not a comfortable experience.  Undeniably this film will continue to be talk about in the future, a potential new classic.",

While the movie can be slow at times - the storyline, the cinematic script and the unpredictable editing give this movie its true flavor. I think what made the movie stand out the most was the manner in which the hatred, the intensity, the passion, the pain and the rage was portrayed so amazingly well.\nA must watch for all generations. I for one was blown away by how the production team & the cast members worked to make this movie a totally unforgettable experience. \n\nLoy Machedo's Moment of Truth\nA classic for all ages.\n\nLoy Machedo's Overall Rating\n8.5 out of 10\n\nLoy Machedo\nloymachedo.com | whoisloymachedo.com",

            "content": "The 2013 Oscar race was a tight race. A very, very tight race. My personal favorite to win was Gravity, and American Hustle was deep in the talks for a shot to beat out all the other films. To be honest, though, there was always one thought out clear front runner in the race: 12 Years A Slave. Throughout the Best Picture race, 12 Years A Slave was always thought to take the win. Gravity, maybe, could beat it out, but it was still pretty far behind. 12 Years A Slave's profound message is clear simply through the title itself, and a movie hasn't been this powerful since Schindler's List. It was obvious it would sin the Best Picture, even with Lupita N'yongo grounded to win her Oscar and Steve McQueen and Chiwetel Ejiofor  the frontrunners at one point in their categories. So clearly, 12 Years A Slave was big and won Best Picture at the Oscars. Now, it's time to understand if it was deserved of Best Picture or not. It definitely was. \r\n\r\n  12 Years A Slave was a 2013 drama film directed by Steve McQueen and written by John Ridley based on the book of the same name written by Solomon Northrup. It stars Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita N'yongo, Michael Fassbender, Bryan Batt, Brad Pitt, and many more. Steve McQueen's direction is what made the film strong and hard to watch. It's also what made it the best movie of 2013 according to many critics. His direction was unique, excellent to watch and used a beautiful score and great cinematography. In total, his direction was great and he perfectly portrayed this story like no other.\r\n\r\n  The acting was also very good in the movie. Chiwetel Ejiofor was a bit off as Solomon Northrup, looking as if he conveyed only one emotion throughout and nothing else. I wish his character could convey more diversity in emotion, but other than that it was a real good performance. Michael Fassbender was my favorite in the movie, for he played a ruthless villain like no other. He was intimidating, hateful, and pure evil. He was amazing in his performance, and every emotion he conveyed was spot on. In my opinion, it was the best performance of 2013. Lupita N'yongo also gave a stellar performance, being a very broken slave who is heavily abused by Michael Fassbender. The best female performance of 2013 as well, I definitely thought she deserved the Oscar over Jennifer Lawrence. All the other actors did great in the film, and in total, I thought it was one of the best acting ensembles I've seen in a while.\r\n\r\n  The writing by John Ridley was also very good. It perfectly portrayed the horror of America's darkest time, and he wrote Solomon Northrup's life without any holding back. I felt the only problem with the film though was the utter lack of humor. I wish at least one piece of dialogue in this movie was funny, at least adding a bit of lightheartedness. The problem was, the darkness throughout the film got a bit annoying, rather than horrifying to watch each time. Other than that, though, Ridley adapts a great film and provides for one of the greatest stories of the past decade.\r\n\r\n 12 Years A Slave in the end is a masterful film. Only Chiwetel Ejiofor's lack of emotions but sadness and the utter devoid of any lightheartedness in the film. The acting though was great from everyone and the direction from Steve McQueen stellar. The writing completely carried a lot of the film, and helped viewers understand the horror and pain in this time of America. In total, 12 Years A Slave is brilliant and a great film, and the best film about America's darkest time in history. And it deserved so much more then Best Picture. 9/10.\r\n\r\nPlease check out my podcast!

History? 12 Years A Slave definitely taught me about history, showed a bit of morality, and much much difficulty. \n\nChiwetel Ejiofor's performance, regardless of the movie itself, made it all the more convincing and interesting for me. A strong supporting cast represented the supporting characters of Solomon Northup's original story and life. \n\nAll in all, Twelve Years A Slave does accurately what few movies nowadays can: portray historical characters accurately and humanely - with all the life and emotion possible.

The tale of Solomon Northup, a free black man living with his family in the free North (New York), before being unexpectedly stripped of his freedom beginning his 12 torturous years as a slave, is an unforgettable one. This awe-striking movie tugs at the emotional fabric holding the audience together and challenges them over and over again with wave after wave of enough tear-jerking moments and graphic violence to fully engage each and every eye on screen for the duration of the film.\n\nBleak is the default tone throughout Steve McQueen's acclaimed (Academy Award - Best Picture) masterpiece 12 Years A Slave. Solomon Northup, portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, is forced to endure the will-breaking horrors of slavery in the 1840's South after being drugged at a dinner which he was invited to under the pretense of being offered a job playing violin in the circus. As Solomon awakens from the night before, he finds himself chained signaling the beginning of the calamitous journey that will forever leave both Northup and the audience changed.\n\nMore misfortune would befall Northup after his improbable journey lands him in the clutches of one of the south's most barbarous slave owners in Master Epps, portrayed by Academy Award nominee Michael Fassbender. An unfortunate sequence of events thrusts Northup into the arduous challenges of surviving the South's most wicked slave owner in Fassbender. Northup's ability to endure the harshest of will-breaking conditions for twelve agonizing years, is what takes him from free man, to slave, to hero. The metamorphosis that Solomon experiences is one that the audience will not soon forget.\n\nThis movie is as real of a depiction of the master and slave dynamic as there has been in cinematography. With a film that centers itself around a plot with this much pain and suffering attached to it, it would have been impossible for McQueen to depict the dehumanizing nature and woeful strife of the slave era's violent past, without authenticating those times down to the bloody detail. McQueen embraces this challenge for 134-minutes while catching the subtle nuances that underscore the master and slave dynamic. Fassbender's wickedness garnered well-deserved Academy Award buzz, while costars Academy Award nominee Chiwetel Ejiofur and Academy Award winner Lupita Nyong'o also breathed believable life into McQueen's characters.\n\nSteve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave, simply put, is the the best slave movie ever made. I do not want to categorize this project, as I think it deserves praise beyond its 'slave movie' designation; however the movie itself serves as a 134-minute fictitious snap shot of what slaves had to endure during a very dark time in American history, and this movie's importance will be immortalized thanks to McQueen's brilliance. While hard to digest at times, 12 Years A Slave earned every bit of gaudy 96% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes and the veneration from the Academy bestowed was well deserved for this graphic masterpiece.",

            "content": "It's hard to talk about a movie that shows us \"what the true horrors of slavery was like\" for a few reasons. Most importantly, no movie is going to be able to do such a thing. The horrors of America's shameful institution cannot be recreated or reenacted in its inhumane entirety. The second is that a goal of eloquently showing the true impact of slavery is hard to do on such a macro scale. Which is why director Steve McQueen chooses to instead show the terror inflicted on one individual specifically, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor).\n\nNorthup is an atypical hero for a slave-era story: he is educated, he is relatively affluent, and he is free. When he is taken from his family, kidnapped and transported to the deep south, he is thrown into a world that he is uncomfortable in. Beyond the obvious discomfort of his new shackles is the anxiety of having been stripped of his identity. Solomon is to be known as \"Platt\", he is encouraged to keep mum of his ability to read and write, and many hint that his talent with the violin could become his undoing. He is not just in a new environment; Solomon is a new person, and not one of his choosing.\n\n12 Years a Slave is a dramatic look at race, but it stands contrary to many attempts by Hollywood to surgically extract your tears from their ducts (Lincoln, The Blind Side, Crash). Instead, McQueen is content to lay the matter before us in a calm manner, and let us decide our reactions. This becomes especially obvious during the most terrifying of moments throughout the film. First, a shop owner named Theophilus Freeman (Paul Giamatti) sells slaves with the playful exuberance you expect at your neighborhood Verizon store, hardly lending a thought to the horrors that lay ahead for his \"merchandise.\" Next, a plantation overseer (Paul Dano) welcomes his new crew with a light rendition of a shocking ditty aimed to both crush the spirits of the new arriving slaves as well as to discourage their attempts at escape. Daily lashings on plantation owner Edwin Epps' (Michael Fassbender) land are carried out routinely after the cotton yield is counted, and these happen with little fanfare or mercy while the world marches on, refusing to notice the pain being inflicted. The most excrutiating attempt at calmly depicting the many horrors of plantations during this era has to be the long shot of Solomon strung up on a tree, toeing his way to saving his own life--McQueen and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt (often a crew-member of McQueen) create a sequence you won't soon forget.\n\nWhere 12 Years a Slave forces its seriousness onto the medium is the score. Many sequences were joined by an intimidating accompaniment, specifically in the most unnerving of moments; indeed the first time the music stands out is Solomon's trip on the slaving boat, which brings him to his horrifying destination. The score remains an important and smartly-used element of this powerful film.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor's performance followed the blueprint set out by McQueen. He was forceful when necessary, and didn't exhaust his thespian background to a fault to try to reel in our empathy. Instead, the subtlety written (and performed) in his interactions with his surroundings bought our appreciation. His terror as he convinces his master that he had no intent to run away will make you hold your breath, and is a critical moment of brilliance by both Ejiofor and Fassbender.\n\nMcQueen's greatest triumph is to introduce a much exhausted topic in American culture, history classes, and cinema, and reinvigorate it with a fresh sense of realness and terror (to clarify, the topic of slavery is not exhausted, merely the dramatic recreation with the intent only to shame and not to learn from our past). Much can be said about his attempt to introduce a hierarchy within the ranks of slaves (those who were born slaves vs. those who were kidnapped like Solomon). But of course, this isn't a new concept. This is a step the director takes to be authentic to all aspects of this dark time in American history.\n\nWhat results is a genuine, gut-wrenching, mesmerizingly exceptional look at an inhumane era.\n\nRead more reviews at RJGFilmAnalysis.com",

            "content": "Packed with a very talented cast, wonderful direction by Steve McQueen, a highly emotional and painful story and highly realistic but brutal detail of slavery, 12 Years a Slave proves itself worthy of its Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor's performance stands solid and is deserving for a Best Actor nomination, but Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender give out the key performances that stand as the best of the film. Steve McQueen, as you may know him, is notorious for making visually disturbing films and this film is one of them, plus it's about slavery. So you should be really prepared because what you will see in this movie is far from comfortable viewing and people under 17 definitely can't watch it.\n\nWhile the film has lack of comfortable viewing, it is at the same time emotionally devastating, especially the ending that made me feel tears inside of me. And it's hard to watch because it's based on true events. But the movie is very well-done in many aspects and it's highly original. It's that kind of film that you can really connect with and show you parts of what it was like to be a slave. I give this film a perfect five-star rating. Truly worthy for Best Picture.",

Director Steve McQueen is an incredibly talented, shameless filmmaker who takes risks and has no problem exposing the truth about real evil in the 1800's. For that, he deserves every accolade. The script is incredible and the costume/production design is stellar, but the movie works because of an incredible ensemble. Chiwetel Ejiofor offers an exemplary piece of emotionally devastating acting, and Michael Fassbender is equal in that degree. Sarah Paulson and Benedict Cumberbatch are standouts as well, but the biggest surprise is newcomer Lupita Nyong'o as Patsy, who walked away with the Oscar for good reason. She's one to keep an eye on. \"12 Years a Slave\" is a very hard film to sit through, but it is no less moving, inspiring, and real. Best movie of the year, without a doubt. It's a film no one is ever going to forget.",

But it feels bland and doesn't strike much off a chord in the emotional level. The slavery scenes are quite gruesome and makes one feel sympathy, but on the whole the film provides no message, it  shows a single man's life, just as he was Clemens left him in the start of the 12 years, he leaves Patsey alone, the film shows the cruelties, but does nothing against, it doesn't make any change in the whole situation after all. Django Unchained was a better slavery film than this and it's to be said for sure. The acting is all good, but other than the characters of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch, all the others are cardboard cut outs. Lupita Nyong'o acting is really good but she doesn't have a big role in here other than to play an extreme victim of slavery. Otherthan Chiwetel Ejiofor's character none of them really have a focus. It's just like the second half of The Pianist(2002), the first half shows really emotional material and it shows you the cruel slaughter of Jews, but the second half is just about the survival of one man. Then carved out a character for Brad Pitt and when he offers to help, Solomon simply wants to escape from there, he doesn't care about the rest of the people in there. My point is that the film shows no movement against slavery from the lead character, after all then what's this all about?",

It is brutal, at times vile, and incredibly humbling. It stirred feelings of genuine disgust in me, at what human beings are capable of doing to each other. It is awful to think that we humans - apparently the most highly evolved species on the planet - are the only animal on this earth that degrades and subjugates it's own kind in the way that we have done in the past, and still do. There are scenes in this film that made me flinch and want to look away, there are also scenes that just brought tears to my eyes. The music in the film is haunting, the cinematography is amazing and incredibly artistic at time, and the performances from Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michael Fassbender are absolutely captivating, both are utterly brilliant. \nEverything about this film is spot on, it's a genuine, 100% MUST SEE. Just don't expect a particularly entertaining 2 hours, but it is an important 2 hours. Watch it, and I hope it gets you thinking about how all humans should be treating each other.",

It nearly brought me to tears how these individuals were so mistreated just for there colour of skin. It took me some time to get out of that zone after watching the movie because I felt so emotional and disturbed. With these things in mind, it's mainly due to the director and his extremely deep vision that could have made a movie touch so many hearts, and the excellent performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor who must have found it difficult to play such a role. All of the actors put in real performances which made the movie believable and heart warming. You do have to be in the right mood to watch this film because the whole mood is extremely deep and, in some ways, shocking. Anyway, I'm so glad that it won the academy award because it definitely deserved it. A Must Watch!\n\nRound-Up:\nI'm not one that is usually into period dramas, but this movie covers a period that touched my heart. You can't help but think, what would you do in that position, but you can never imagine how it must have been for the people who had to go through such an awful nightmare. Anyway, the director picked his cast very well and he made use of there acting skills to tell this impelling story. \n\nBudget: $20million\nWorldwide Gross: $188million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there extremely deep period dramas about slavery in early America. 8/10",

Ejiofor and Nyong'o put on very wonderful performances and Fassbender's is probably some of the best acting I've seen in theaters in a very long time. In all, McQueen and Ridley have created a fascinating epic that intertwines an amazingly deep web of characters acted out by an A+ cast. And don't be fooled, this is not a \"White Guilt\" movie.

When free man Solomon Northup is wrongly captured and forced into slavery, stripped of his dignity and will, his prolonged nightmare of pain, agony and a bleak future can be overcome by the power to survive from within. \r\n\r\nThis is the type of film that you feel the urge to look away, yet at the same time can't look away as the power on screen is so compelling. The camerawork is beautiful, instead of heavy dialogue driven scenes, Steven McQueen uses lengthy close ups to capture raw emotion from the cast, and also places stunning vistas of Louisiana against the backdrop of slaves in pain. The craft is undeniably strong, as well as McQueen's brilliance in the director's chair it's the story and cast performances that truly shine. Chjwetel Ejofor is perfect, he looks terrified, in pain and fearful, I simply cannot fault anyone in this movie. Lupita N'yongo too, she is incredible, speechless is how I felt when watching her whimper at the lashings of ruthless plantation owner Epps, brought to life by Michael Fassbender who has never been more terrifying.\r\n\r\nThis whole movie has Oscar written all over it, awards worthy from top to bottom. It's lavishly designed from sets to costumes, beautifully scored and impeccably written with astonishing performances. The ending is one I didn't see coming, out of nowhere hope comes to save Solomon, I'm glad it finished with a more upbeat and rewarding end for this character. This is simply unmissable, the reviews and awards say it all, 12 Years A Slave is essential cinema.",

Some scenes are even too slow paced, it's not a bad thing to have slow paced scenes, but to pace these scenes slowly was useless and didn't really make sense. The score was done by Hans Zimmer and it distracted because it sounded so much like the Inception score, I can't be the only one who didn't notice.

Where \"Hunger\" dealt with the desperation of IRA prisoners and \"Shame\" explored the outer limits of sex addiction, his new film comes about as close to a literal gut punch as you can get.\n\nAmong the most overt features of the film is the extent to which violence is portrayed. Gore has a firm place throughout, and the audience is often shown nauseatingly graphic depictions of whipping and beatings. One standout scene even manages to out-do Mel Gibsons \"Passion of Christ\" extended whipping scene by a substantial margin, and the pain of the recipient is almost palpable through the screen. While these moments are disgusting, they are often made made far worse by the context in which they're placed. Nudity is frequent, and often used with artistic skill to make us feel uneasy, especially given the backdrop. Music underscores the tone well, and Hans Zimmer once again provides a fitting soundtrack which is occasionally bolstered by clever audio design.\n\nOne of the most impressive things to note about the direction of the film was it's simplicity. The most harrowing scenes are the ones in which very little is going on. Elements, with no exceptions, are placed with intent and clear purpose. The result is that although scenes are often long, you would be hard pressed to find any excess or filler throughout the movie, something increasingly rare as directors cram more content into the same space.\n\nAs a result of the very simple camera work and framing, on top of the sheer length of many shots, 12 Years a Slave often feels quite voyeuristic, and you'll likely want to look away from the screen as McQueen stubbornly refuses to cut away from the abject suffering. It's a window into a real persons life and draining as it is, you'll feel compelled to continue watching purely for Solomon Northup's character. This is among Chiwetel Ejiofors few lead roles, and he is unnervingly convincing in every second he spends onscreen. The majority of its supporting cast, including Michael Fassbender, Paul Dano and Benedict Cumberbatch are similarly intelligent in their portrayal of distasteful, demeaning and frequently debasing characters. As expected, they all display extraordinary talent in conversation, but also do a surprising amount in silence. Facial expressions are often far more profound in meaning than any words exchanged, and Ejiofors in particular takes advantage of this to great effect.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie is not without fault. Sarah Paulson plays Mary Epp with a harsh single toned menace which, while not totally out of place in the landscape of the film, is nevertheless severely outclassed by a group of simply better actors. Brad Pitts appearance also seemed like a misstep, as although in truth his acting was acceptable, the cameo was simply distracting for me, although if you can see past him being Brad Pitt in his scenes you may disagree. Frankly, just like in my Captain Phillips review, I also have to mention the blatant recycling of Zimmer's \"Time\" theme from \"The Thin Red Line\" and \"Inception\". Although this will be no issue for a casual movie goer, for fans of Zimmer's work recognising this riff several times throughout the movie will likely be distracting.\n\nBut these are minor quarrels which in truth you would have to be intensely pessimistic to hold against the film, especially when it does so much right. From the frightening violence to the electric acting, it's easy to run out of adjectives to describe the emotional rollercoaster which 12 Years a Slave invariably is, but it is a movie which you should subject yourself if for the acting alone.\n\n- expandac.com",

McQueen has never been one to shy away from the brutality of human beings, and here is no exception. Visceral and disturbing, 12 Years a Slave dives right into the tragedy of the crimes people perpetrate upon one another for no other reason than they can. At its heart, however, it is a story of the enduring resilience of the human spirit. Solomon continues to believe that he will be saved by the decency of others, even in the face of unimaginably violence and brutality at the hands of others.",

I want to live.\r\n\r\nIf you are one who grew up in the United States and progressed through the american school system, than the institution of slavery and therefore 12 Years A Slave's plot-points should be very familiar.  Just about everything we learned in school has some screen time in Steve McQueen's adaptation of Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir; from picking cotton at whip's end and finding respite in song to the passive cruelty of the scorned plantation owner's wife, its all here.  But if you were to think it nothing more than a textbook on celluloid you would be mistaken. \r\n\r\n12 Years A Slave takes all these familiar teachings and infuses them with something even the best professors cannot, empathy.  Through the magnificent performances by 12 Years A Slaves' talented cast, the film cuts through the elements everyone expects from the picture to grasp something special.  It is not only through the film's horrific scenes of violence that we understand either, many times the camera just lingers on characters engaged in no work and sensing the phycological hell they endure from not knowing the location and health of their loved ones, or simply the anguish of knowing all is lost. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest aspect of the picture might be the fact that 12 Years A Slave is very much it's own film.  With all the violence and psychological horror that was an everyday hurdle for slaves, the picture could very easily had evolved into another Schindler's List, and while the picture does indeed have it's share a graphic violence and psychological torment, when the credits roll, the impression the picture imparts feels less violent and more emotional than Spielberg's holocaust drama. \r\n\r\n12 Years A Slave ultimately uses it's relatively unique source material to lay bare the inhumanity of one the darkest chapters in american history.",

The thing is that this movie is not as good as people say it is. The transitions are awkward and far from subtle. Many of the charecters are pretty bland. I think the only exceptions to the blandness are Solomon, and maybe the slave owner who rapes the black girl. Many times charecters are seen without any explanation or enhancement of the plot (I.e. those Native Americans, those guys executing the slaves, and the slave who got stabbed on the boat), but are focused on heavily in the one scene or scenes they are in that you are meant to think they have importance. Sadly no matter how many times I rewatch those scenes I find no meaning to those charecters. The subject matter is cliche and underwhelming. Despite the cliche subject matter I did enjoy how the movie wasn't afraid to say \"nigger\" a lot more times than in movies of recent years. I also feel the idea of a free man, kidnapped, beaten, and turned back into a slave is interesting. Having said that I do also feel that we don't see much of the longing to get back home you'd expect from that. Now I do know why because it's explained pretty well that he can't show that he's educated or was free, but still I can think of a few ways to convey his secret feelings that weren't taken advantage of. Also in the beginning what is up with the chick who makes Solomon finger her randomly? Were slave chicks just super horny? Anyways if you want a boring, drawn out, cliche filled, and overrated movie to waste your time watching then be my guest. As for me I'll watch a good movie that won't put me to sleep.",

This is a harrowing and heavy-going look at slavery in the Deep South before it was abolished in America, sort of like the anti-Django Unchained, because this is REAL. However, it's so compelling and moving to watch. 1841, and free negro Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) lives and works in Saratoga Springs, New York. But he's tricked into going to Washington D.C. where he's imprisoned and sent into slavery where he's sold to plantation owner William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), and they manage to get on well, but after Solomon attacks's Ford's carpenter John Tibeats (Paul Dano), who in turn tries to Lynch him. But, Ford see's Tibeats off, and to protect Solomon, sends him to work with cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender), who is brutal and very racist. Solomon tries to survive, but an encounter with Canadian Bass (Brad Pitt) might be his salvation. It makes you angry that stuff like this went on in the Deep South, but throughout the film, there's an everlasting glimmer of hope that our hero will escape from this hellish life and get home. McQueen gets the best from his cast, and it's not an easy film to watch, but it's a very thoughtful yet upsetting and painful history lesson.",

It is discouraging how lopsided the positive to negative review ratio is, creating monstrous hype that surely disappointed many expecting Roots 2.0 or at least a film that's half as good as Glory. Both of those are considerably better works that serve to better humanize slave characters while actually being entertaining.\r\n\r\nIn a pre-Civil War time, there were people who would abduct free black men who lived in the north and forced them into a life of slave labor in the south. The evil, evil south, half filled with raging, sadistic, one-dimensional cartoon villains, the other filled with white knights who sympathize with the plight of the slaves but usually do nothing about it. This may have been a true story and it sounds like an interesting one, but the entire focus of the movie was for the protagonist, Solomon Northup, to be miserable. Maybe the film just resonates with people who have an extreme sensitivity to white guilt, but I am completely bewildered that this is being called an \"important\" film. It's supposed to be entertaining, isn't it? Do you really need to see actors pretending to whip each other to reaffirm your belief that slavery is bad?\r\n\r\nThe film tends to linger on things for a very long time. Beatings, an almost hanging and the like, they just go on and on in an attempt to milk the feelings out of you. For me, for what could have been a great story, they focused on the wrong thing and made the plot extremely thin (man is captured, man is a slave, man is miserable, man is freed) and proceeded to pad it out. By the time you reach the end, you don't really get a sense that 12 years have passed. It feels more like 2 Hours A Slave. The resolution is all too quick and rushed to feel satisfying, giving me a sense of, \"Oh, now it's over.\"\r\n\r\nThey really dropped the ball on how Solomon was written. While the audience is definitely made sympathetic to him, there is nothing else to the character. He's a father, a husband, extremely intelligent and prefers to keep his head down and bear it in order to survive, rather than rebel or take risks. But that's everything you'll ever know. Contrasted to the aforementioned villains and other characters, it only makes him seem more boring.\r\n\r\nThe villains are on the loopy, angry side, sometimes coming off as campy, as the actors chew into their roles like taffy. On the other hand, there are three white male/knight characters played by Benedict Cumberbatch, Brad Pitt and Garret Dillahunt, who seem more complex and rounded. They have palpable, conflicting feelings as they fraternize with Solomon. Each time you see them, you think, \"Okay, here we go, this nice white guy's gonna save him finally, hurray!\" It becomes a case of the protagonist becoming a passive object, a male damsel in distress who is completely helpless, while white men steal every scene to either physically and mentally subdue him or give the audience hope that rescue is a possibility.\r\n\r\nA terse text epilogue sums up the more interesting story: there was a trial for the men responsible for his abduction. Why THAT wasn't filmed is a missed opportunity. I wanted to see Solomon as he readjusted to life as a free man. I wanted to see justice at the trial. I wanted to know more about the abduction operation, especially in order to see it being dismantled. But I suppose if all they wanted to show was how being a slave is terrible, they certainly succeeded in that regard. Too bad it's manipulative and obvious.",

The audible gasps from the audience throughout the movie are proof that McQueen succeeded in capturing the injustice, inequality, human suffering, and death that remains the darkest chapter of our nation's past.\n     \nAn educated northern black man is taken from his family and the free life he was living in pre-Civil War America, turning his world upside down. In a blink of an eye he's bought and sold to southern slave owners and renamed.  However unjust and misplaced his circumstances are, this new slave, Solomon Northup, must immediately struggle to survive while keeping faith that someday he'll return to his family and a freed life.\n     \nThe brilliance of this Oscar-nominated 'Best Picture' (9 nominations overall) is the patience it takes to describe the cruel and savage treatment of slaves.  It clearly illustrates how a northern black man with his \"freedom papers\" and an education had a different life than one without in the South--who was left to be viewed as \"property\".  The film is an emotional, intense, and raw look at not only black men enslaved by powerful white slave owners, but also from the perspective of black women and children who were victims of the same human suffering and died.  Lastly, we catch a small glimpse of the differences between northern whites and slave owning southern whites that becomes a precursor to the Civil War years later.\n     \n'12 Years a Slave' is a profoundly solemn and shocking film that will make viewers uncomfortable and sad-and rightfully so.  A powerful film such as this one is as necessary to acknowledging our history's faults as it is to making a film touting America's success stories. To do anything less would allow all who suffered during those unbearable years to be trivialized or, worse, possibly forgotten.  This chapter of our nation's history is very difficult to watch and yet impossible to forget; both equally important to understanding our past and our present.  When we forget who we are and the missteps we've made, we're more likely to move backwards and repeat our mistakes.  This is a 'must-see' movie that will leave you wanting to make sure that never happens.\n     \nGrade: A",

            "content": "The movie that won the best picture Oscar, did it deserve it? I am here to answer that question. I think it didn't deserve the award, before you start hating me, let me explain. For a human drama, I didn't care for any of the characters. I know they are based on real people; I just did not care for any of them. Different reviews say that this was more of an experience, about slavery in The Unites States of America. To be fair, there are many documentaries that show you how it was in this time frame. The reason I did not care for the main character, is because the movie does not give me a reason to care. The only reasons I found were; he has a family, he was free and now he's not. The last reason is used a lot in this movie. The main character is always crying out, yelling, I was a free man. This does not make me care more about him. The reason I didn't care for the supporting characters; the other characters weren't shown enough for me to care. This has nothing to do with the actors. The acting is great; they deserve their nominations and wins. The dialogue is great, it's very real, and it sounds nice. It makes it sound very sophisticated, and gives an emotional depth to the movie. It does look great, the cinematography is wonderful. It's directed great, despite me saying I didn't care for any of the characters; there are some very emotional scenes I got choked up in. The movie does show the brutality that the slaves went through. That's what this movie is trying to do, and it successfully does that. That's all this movie does, is show us what the slaves went through. Steve McQueen, the director, tries to add substance to something that doesn't have anything to show for. There were better movies in 2013, I did not think this should have won. Would I recommend this? Not really, not because I did not think it was as good as other people thought, but because it's not an easy watch. Most people might not want to see all the violence in this movie. If you want to see an Oscar movie, because you're a film buff, by all means go ahead. If you're not a film buff, it really is your choice if you want to sit through this.",

The story just gets worse and worse until the very end, but even then we find out justice wasn't handed down in the courts against his perpetrators. The kind of movie that breaks your heart and is so convincing you see ur self in the main character. Set against the beautiful southern backdrop of nature it's hard to comprehend the evil going on down there. You keep waiting for his story to get better but for a long time it just gets harder and more soul crushing. Some terrible villains in this movie and terrible to think that this happened, but history isn't pretty. I felt terrible for patsey and worried what would happen to her and the others left behind. This film doesn't shy away from being uncomfortable and chooses to linger there instead. It wasn't just the slavery but also the Inhumane treatment were the bad ppl tried to always make them feel nothing n the constant oppression n hopelessness that really tears at u.

It shames you to know you are surrounded by this type of hate on a daily basis. I'm sickened they made this torture porn. I'm going to say don't watch it because it teaches nothing but how unimaginably stupid human beings can/were/are able to be. The idea of saying that a human is someone's property is demonic all on its own. I'm a gay Christian and this movie was just a nightmare, grim and demonic from the start. It was way way too out there...    To know this was the world, and to think that it hasn't changed much since.

            "content": "Twelve Years a Slave is an adaptation of the 1853 memoir of the same name by Solomon Northup, a New-York state born free Negro who was kidnapped in Washington D.C. in 1841 and sold into slavery. He worked on plantations in the state of Louisiana for twelve years before his release.\nIt is depressing, sad, annoying, frustrating to watch what Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) went through his 12 years as a slave. A great performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor whose act of bewilderment, despair, anguish, trying to survive is just outstanding. There are moments when with no sound and little movement, he projects what hopelessness looks like. His 12 years of unthinkable abuse, backbreaking labour, fading dreams of happy family, desperateness to figure a way out to his freedom...every act moves us. The brutality, dehumanizing acts of the masters make it so tough to even look at the screen.\n\nFord (Benedict Cumberbatch) as a cotton plantation owner is shown as humane yet ineffectual who eventually sells Solomon to the vicious, drunken Epps (Michael Fassbender), another cotton plantation owner. Epps is ruthless. The screen timings with him in the frame are like an unbearable demonstration of misery in movement.\n\nAnother applauding performance has come from Patsey (Lupita Nyong'o) who is vocal about her grief, a young slave, victim of Epps' barbarous and insane ways. She is raped and beaten by Epps, who is also a cause of envy to Epps' wife who feels that Epps has an eye on her.\n\nI was actually moved by lot many scenes in the movie. Mother's pleading not to separate her from her two children, still all three being sold to different masters creates a lump in the throat. Solomon strung up by the neck for a transgression and his toes are barely touching the dark plantation mud as he dangles, near-dead under the scorching sun. Another disturbing visual is merged with this i.e. children are playing in the background, other slaves are going ahead with their chores since they fear that if they would help Solomon, they would lose their lives. Patsey somehow manages to give him little water. The psyche of the slaves, their surrendering to the fate one side and the heartless brutality of the masters / overseers on another side are very well captured. The night Patsey comes to Platt (Solomon's identity as a slave), asking him to kill her is a scene of unbearable pain, particularly as Platt turns his back and Patsey sobs into the night. Male / female slaves with their bleeding back after being beaten up (almost to death) choked me. Solomon just wanting to rush with officials who came to free him (following Bass -Brad Pitt's) efforts, turning back to give a warm hug to Patsey is so overwhelming.    \n\nIt depicts the dark chapter of slavery in American History. It is beyond one's imagination the kind of suffering the slaves faced. A complete shame to humanity.\n\nSteve McQueen as director is adept with his articulation. Though the title says that Solomon would be slave for 12 years, McQueen and John Riddley makes us feel that it could be forever. Sean Bobbit (Cinematographer) has given great aerial shots which are so effective in making us bewildered, disoriented, and a complete lost feel along with the protagonist.\n\n12 Years a Slave isn't easy to watch since it not only unfolds the tragedy of Solomon in particular but it also depicts the tragedy of such countless souls who lost the biggest gift of mankind- the freedom.",

Making it all the more bitter was the stark reality that stories like Solomon's were scarce, and most of the enslaved lived and died under the conditions. The performances from each and every cast member were immersive and raw. Its difficult to believe so many beloved actors could muster the twisted hatred required of them everyday. I don't think I could watch it again, but the experience is seared so profoundly in my head, that I certainly don't need to.",

            "content": "Dare I say the frontrunner for the most overrated film of 2013? All the rest from the Oscar pile hovered around the 4 star mark but this really did not meet expectation. Many may have rated this highly purely on its serious context. Perhaps there was a subconscious fear that if they did not publicly applaud it then it would be a sign of them trivialising the issue. On the contrary, I feel even more inclined to voice my disagreements with the film's direction since they had a very strong premise here to produce a epic but, in my opinion, failed. \n\nOne of the biggest problems I encountered was the tempo and flow of the story. Scenes were short and skipped ahead to one shocking incident to another very quickly without any sufficient link to a developed story arc. There was no natural progression, no time to linger on the mental and physical anguish of the slaves after each event. If it wasn't for the title, I would never have realised the film's timeline spanned anywhere near twelve years. It resembled a play in many respects. Most scenes were close-ups on only two speakers, the language sounded like that of Shakespearean origin while the background and other characters often served as little more than props. This could be a personal preference but I did not find this approach effective and would much rather a Scorsese or 'The Godfather' style with extended scenes and in-depth character studies. Another remarkable element was the lack of character development. No real connections were established between the audience and any of the slaves (only knew the name of one other slave).  Even the main character could have done with some productive monologues to keep the audience up to date with his mental transition during captivity. Michael Fassbender proves the most engaging as the fierce plantation owner but he could be reasonably accused of hamming it up a touch. As depressing as they may have been in nature, this limited the emotion behind the more horrific scenes.  \n\nThe imagery is powerful and there are moments which will stay in viewers' memories for a while, the last whipping scene in particular. In spite of this, the director chose the wrong angle to adapt this book onto the big screen and consequently the '12 years a slave' was not done the justice it deserved.",

The film has a terrific acting cast,Brad Pitt, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o, Michael Fassbender and Benedict Cumberbatch are a few of the names among them. Again for me, the performance of Michael Fassbender stands out. He plays the part of Edwin Epps, a malevolent slave owner who gets pleasure from abusing the slaves he owns. Fassbender is known for playing very complex and what I consider very difficult roles in his acting career and for me, this is one of the most difficult. However, as usual he pulls off the part perfectly and makes it believable that he is the person he is playing, that is why he is my favourite actor of all time. Visually the film is stunning with great colours and great shots which is typical of a Steve McQueen film. It is a film that makes you flinch because of the brutality, but it is extremely impressive in the way that it reveals the truth, however harsh it is, it must be realised and remembered.",

Steve McQueen (\"Hunger\", \"Shame\") is a great director who has proven to be quite eclectic with only three films to credit (tackling hunger strikes, sex addiction and now slavery) and his collaborator in all three movies, the underrated Michael Fassbender gets probably the flashiest role of his career playing a classic villain as Northup's second master, plantation owner Edwin Epps, who is anal about how much cotton his slaves pick and has the hots for slave Patsy (Lupita N'yongo). Nyong'o is a tour-de-force in a relatively brief role (that is astoundingly her film debut) - while she starts off silently enduring the abuse of her master and the wrathful envy of his ruthless wife (Sarah Paulson in a solid villainous role), she gets to demonstrate a wide emotional range leading up to a key climactic scene where Epps orders Solomon to whip Patsy. That scene, in addition to one where Solomon is left hanging for nearly a day after getting into a fight with a carpenter (Paul Dano) while in possession of his first owner, the kind-hearted William Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch), is one of the movie's best two. The first scene is long and perfectly conveys the dreadful sense of time that Northup must have felt. Like the latter scene with Patsy, it puts us right there with him - you will feel the discomfort and the pain. Ejiofor is very strong and carries the movie well. His character is by no means an empathetic slave - he is a survivor who tries to make the best out of his situation and is keen on freeing himself at the right time. He manages to portray that strength and show weakness and vulnerability at the right moments. The only thing is that key supporting players tend to outshine him. This is definitely one of the best movies about slavery (but I wouldn't call it the \"Schindler's List\" of slave movies). Adapted to the screen by John Ridley from the 1853 memoir of the same name by Solomon Northup. Winner of 3 Oscars: Picture, Supporting Actress (Nyong'o) and Adapted Screenplay; Nominated for 6 Others: Director, Actor (Ejiofor), Supporting Actor (Fassbender), Costume Design, Editing, Production Design.",

Pretty sure this was his white guilt, Oscar whirring movie.  Look, I get it. Slavery was bad.  There were some really bad slave owners. But this effort is so heavy handed and clich\u00e9.  There's some good acting, though I found the supporting performances from Benedict Cumberbatch (The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug), Paul Giamatti (Turbo), Paul Dano (Prisioners), Sarah Paulson (Mud), and particularly Michael Fassbender (Prometheus) more impressive than that of the lead by Chiwetel Ejiofor (Salt), the Oscar-winning supporting performance of Lupita Nyong'o, and the two underwhelming turns from Alfre Woodard (\"True Blood\") and Brad Pitt (World War Z).  It marches through all the tropes of a movie about slavery and racism, but makes sure to throw in there a few Biblical quotes that are out of context, just to go a step further in painting the whites as evil.  It's not a terribly engaging story beyond the white guy bad, black guy good.  Even though it tries to paint a few whites as tolerable, they're just the tokens.  And I'm sorry, but even in the \"tolerant\" North, it's highly unlikely that the scenes depicted there were even remotely accurate.  Oh, and the whole build up around Nyong'o's character is shortchanged entirely in the end.  Honestly, as despicable as he was, Fassbender's character was the most nuanced.  Pitt's was just laughable.  And now, my biggest complaint of the film - I love Hans Zimmer (The Lone Ranger), but his score for this movie felt like scattershot cabbaged from 'Sherlock Holmes'.  Truly disappointing.  The movie is typical Oscar bait, and mix that with the Academy's white guilt/disguised racism, and you have your Best Picture.",

Mcqueen not only fails to  recognise that he has remade a film that was originally made in 1984 but his dwelling on the violence, almost lovingly is almost pornogrphic.  It is shocking and I was glad when the end came and unlike most people didn't think it was that well acted- Wolf of Wall St and Blue Jasmin were much better films.  It also allowed Hollywood to ignore Mandela, a better but not perfect film but of course probably too political of which is something that McQueen's film could never be accused",

Though it is a brutal story, that may be difficult film to watch for some people.",

It took more than a decade for the truth to come out and this film is adapted from a memoir of his struggles. 12 Years A Slave is a harrowing picture that drove me to tears on more than one instance during my initial viewing. This is largely due to passionate performances from its cast, but credit is also due to Steve McQueen's expert direction and Hans Zimmer's emotive score. This film can be painful to watch, but it's an evocative example of cinema's ability to facilitate heartfelt storytelling.",
