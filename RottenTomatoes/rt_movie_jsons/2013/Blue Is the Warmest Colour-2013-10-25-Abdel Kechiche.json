The scripting isn't nearly good enough to survive the long talking heads takes, cutting and camera movement are devoid of any visual creativity, the eye starts to scream at the endless clumsy colour symbolism after the first hour, and any movie-lover will get impatient at having the same wretched point hammered home for ten solid minutes (\"Ooh, look, Sedoux's chatting up her ex at the party and ignoring her lover...fifteen successive shots now, is it?\"). The crippled narrative is not relieved by always resorting to clumsily-filmed dancing to distract from the lack of pace, and while I'm seldom on the same page as radical feminist criticism, I may have to agree with their objections to the attempts to do an entire Lesbian Kama Sutra. The only memorable or erotic shot in the whole dreary movie was a few seconds of the leads gazing at each other before a shy first kiss, and it's almost impossible to go wrong with that subject matter. Skip it and make yourself some popcorn to enjoy without waiting for something to happen in this paralytic narrative.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nI have never seen a film about a face until Blue. Almost every emotion the face can show is expressed by the leading actress: longing, satisfaction, shame, allure, hunger, anger, grief, boredom, suspicion. I was worried after the opening scenes that the film was one of stark realism despite its whimsical title. However, after a short time, it took on its poetical style, and in the street, just before Adele sees Emma, we hear the first sound of music. From then on the film is an exercise in cinematic eloquence.\n\nIn one particular scene, Adele wanders into a lesbian club still under the impression of the blue-haired woman she had seen days or weeks before. The club is small and packed and she can't seem to find her bearings. Adele makes it to the back of the club which resembles a dark abyss. She has the look of someone at once desperately searching and giving up the search. Then, behind her, the top of Emma's head appears from somewhere out of the shadows as a looming orb of dark blue. You don't see where Emma comes from; you don't see her face or body, just a color. When Emma sits down at the bar with Adele their first exchange is instantly dynamic and absorbing. If you compare this conversation with the talk Adele engages in with her classmates at the beginning , it's easy to admit that Adele is far more mature, thoughtful, and intellectually eager than her peers.\n\nTo appreciate the subtleties of this scene we have to recall one of the first moments in the film when Adele's teacher asked her class if love at first sight feels like the gaining of something or the losing of something. Is it possible that the director is also trying to answer this question?\n\nThe sex scenes will doubtlessly make some uncomfortable; such authenticity is something rarely seen on screen, but they are neither gratuitous nor pornographic. There's nothing more gratuitous than the old lie that's been told throughout cinematic history of woman as a passive sexual being, and the women in this film are anything but passive.\n\nContrary to other reviews, no single sex scene in Blue is 10 minutes long. There are three sex scenes and together they add up to 10 minutes, but the scene everyone is talking about is at most five minutes, unless the film they showed at Cannes if different from the one making the film festival circuit.",

Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux, as Adele's love interest, are both excellent in the lead roles.  Working with a beautiful color palette (and countless shades of blue!!) director Abdel Kechiche meticulously dissects the minute details of first love, from burning passion to painful separation.  The downside? The whole film plays itself out over a crushingly long almost three-hour run time, far too long when one considers the subject matter.  On second viewing, you can easily identify the scenes that add nothing to the plot or character development, almost screaming to be left on the editing room floor.",

But the strangest component of this film is the sex; it's apparently received detailed criticism from lesbian audience members for being an inaccurate and almost silly interpretation, but worse than that is how frequently it is used compared to how little it adds to the story. They just seem randomly sprinkled in, as if to make sure that the audience doesn't fall asleep during the film's considerable three hour runtime. \n\nThe structure is there and the performances are solid, but I have little to no idea about some of the creative decisions in this film beyond continuously reinforce that this is an A-list cinematic treatment of a lesbian romance, drowning in self-importance. I didn't stick around to watch the end of the credits, but I can imagine director Abdellatif Kechiche just walking out once the screen goes black, his hand outstretched waiting for someone to put an award in it.

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Color is a profoundly complex film that follows French teen Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos) on her path to self-discovery. In it, we witness the kindling of an intensely erotic and emotional relationship between Adele and an older art student, Emma (Léa Seydoux), and the challenges she encounters in their relationship. First off, this film is fabulously written and directed, and while at first it'll feel a little slow and gratuitous, once you finish the film and think about the themes a little you'll soon realize that every shot and offhand remark in the film actually mattered. Despite that however, the first hour of the movie is just tough to get through, and when rewatching it I always have to resist the urge to skip ahead to interesting bits, and that definitely takes away from the enjoyability of the film. What you will be able to appreciate the whole way through are the fantastic performances by Adèle Exarchopoulos (christ that's a long name) and Léa Seydoux. This is the first time I've seen Exarchopoulos (let's just call her Ex) on screen, and I have to say I'm immensely impressed at how able she is at portraying such a finely tuned character, and it shows that she's got a lot of emotional range and dedication to her craft. What surprised me even more is that this might be my favourite portrayal of Léa Seydoux yet, Emma is both energetic and charismatic, capable of passion and regret and so many more emotions than the stone-cold-monotone-chick she regrettably gets typecast as in Hollywood movies. Seeing Seydoux perform in a role like this absolutely reaffirms my beliefs in her abilities as an actress with amazing potential. I do have to note that there are some quite serious controversies about appalling working conditions and a douchebag director, but there is no doubt that these excellent performances helped carry this movie throughout it's lengthy runtime. Yes, this movie is admittedly 3 hours long, but I promise you if you have some patience you will be rewarded for it. If you haven't watched this movie yet, you should definitely make some time for it; Watch it in 90 minute halves if you have to, but I'd recommend a second, and even third viewing of this absolutely masterful film (in writing, direction and performance) to fully embrace it's brilliance.",

It's not because I feel as if sex between women in film is always fetishy, hell, as a lesbian I think shying away from the sexual relationships between women is harmful in its own right. But while I was watching these seemingly out of nowhere scenes, I immediately felt so disappointed. The movie follows Adèle, a teenager at the beginning of the film, to which her age stays quite ambiguous at the start of her romantic and sexual relationship with adult Emma, but I digress. Their relationship was interesting to me, as Adèle meets Emma at a lesbian bar and sparks start to fill the room. It struck me as destined for failure yet captivating, like a car crash, you just can't look away at the damage that might've not happened, but alas it is too late. The second I felt their relationship start to become merely a sexual fantasy by a straight man, was at that first sex scene. I didn't feel as if the characters were living and breathing that moment, but as if they were doing it to preform. It ruined the illusion of these characters for me. As they are having sex with each other for the first time, they seem to know exactly what to do, which is very unrealistic, and clearly pandering to a specific audience. A sex scene at the very least should say something about the story or the characters. These sex scenes said nothing of value, unless \"getting the audience off\" is valuable, in which case, great that's the only purpose they serve. If the only problem with the movie was that the sex scenes felt staged, I wouldn't have given it such a low rating. The reason why this movie just fell so flat for me, was that after that initial sex scene the characters started to feel like puppets for a lesbian sex fantasy. No growth from the characters at all, Adèle felt like a submissive teenager for Emma to be dominant to for the entire film, despite the fact that Adèle is actively growing up in this story. This should be a point in her life where she is experiencing the most growth as she matures into an adult and finds what she wants from life. But all she seemingly wants from life is an orgasm, as I just didn't feel her as a person anymore. Same with Emma, as I found myself no longer invested in their lives and was just waiting for the end of the film. My point here is not that straight men can't create/direct stories about women who feel attracted to other women, but that a majority of the time, the women in these stories feel less like actual people, with actual wants, needs, and struggles, and more like sexual objects, whose only want or need or struggle is how fast their going to get laid. That's my rant on this film and if you are reading this and you did enjoy the movie, please don't let me ruin it for you. There were merits to this film, such as the discussion on casual homophobia and the way it dealt with the grief of leaving relationships. Just the way it handled female sexuality, specifically sexuality involving two women, completely left me with disgust.",

The manipulation of the color blue and its meaning were so well done throughout the film. For example, the massive shift in the movie can be predicted by the color change of Emma's hair. Also, blue is used to symbolize the enlightenment of Adele but then to show her isolation from the world. The movie does an excellent job of explaining the problem of finding one's identity and how you can be isolated from others if you do not embrace it. The lack of a soundtrack is another plus to this movie since the audience can focus on the emotions being unraveled by the characters in the scenes. The only problem with the movie was how they skipped two important plots concerning Adele. First, the storyline of Adele confronting her high school peers about her being in a relationship with Emma. Second, the storyline of Adele coming out to her parents. Those two time periods should not have been glossed over since they were probably influential in shaping Adele's character in the future.",

And the ending is horribly, beautifully unsatisfactory.\n\nI hesitated about giving this five stars before I thought about this review and realised we are probably dealing with a modern masterpiece here.

The story is really well written, the actors and actresses who are from France have acted fantastically including Léa Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos who have great chemistry on screen.

Shots go on too long; sex scenes are prurient rather than revealing, showing no more emotional depth than a clever editor could have shown in a quarter of the time.  Scenes of dialogue establish characters over and over on the same territory without deepening our understanding of them.  References to literature border on the pretentious: well-read people will know why the books and writers get mentioned, but it's a little too arch for my taste to name drop Sartre in the middle of a movie, like an intellectual product-placement.\n\nMost importantly, it dabbles in the social politics of lesbianism just enough to raise the question of whether it intends to grapple with those politics.  (It doesn't, conspicuously or originally.)\n\nAgainst all that must be set the lead actresses, both of whom find unexpected nuance and truth in their performances.  They are not presented as \"lesbian types,\" and this saves the film from being boringly polemical.  It's primarily a love story whose protagonists happen to check the \"L\" box.  It seems them as people with complex and interesting selves, not merely complex and interesting sexuality.   This makes it worth watching.",

But it does remind me of one of those good old seventies films that gently unfolds rather than is overtly directed - how they were before films went all corporate. It's a snapshot of the life of Adéle, during that fertive period of graduating and starting a career; gradually discovering who she is and what her place in the world, her supple young mind getting to grips with ideas of art, literature,philosophy and, indeed, politics - and there are some inspirational  gems presented here in a charmingly understated fashion, that makes the easy, natural conversation the film contains quite fascinating. Midst it all she is discovering who her real friends are, what her own values and how to cut free and follow them, and her own sexuality. She learns one of life's hardest lessons - she gets her heart broke.\n\nNow, she didn't become the youngest person ever to win the Cannes Film Festival 'Palme d'Or' award (and 37 other nominations) purely for her willingness to bare everything - and I do mean EVERYTHING!- but the break up scene with her lesbian lover is gut-wrenching, raw, intense stuff. You feel her pain. An incredible performance, it's like it's happening for real right before your eyes, a lightning bolt caught on camera.\n\nThree hours is normally a tad long for me, and if they had cut the sex scenes it would have been a more normal length film - that's how much bare-ass, steamy, getting it on there is in this film! It's French after all. But it all does set the scene for just how deeply Adèle falls for this, her first, love. That's my excuse anyway. She's also fit as. Just sayin.\n\nNo CGI, no intricate plot, no panoramic camera work, but a story that feels real and a performance of unbridled raw emotion. Can't recommend this film enough.",

            "content": "Absolutely deserving of all the praise and accolades it received upon its release back in 2013, Blue Is The Warmest Colour is one of the most intense and emotionally challenging romances every filmed. Much like The Spectacular Now, released a year later, it doesn't fill itself with platitudes or clobber you over the head with overbearing introspection, it just tells a love story. The characters meet, become attracted, face difficulties and discover things about love they would never have known before. The 2 leads are incredible. Newcomer Adèle Exarchopoulos lights up the screen with her smile and dampens it with her tears, and Léa Seydoux exudes a level of confident energy that makes it easy to see what our heroine sees in her. It might run a bit long, and would benefit from having 20-30 minutes cut from it, but almost all of what's on screen is golden. It's one of the most passionate love stories ever told, and while the sex scenes might be considered excessive and exploitative, they're driven by sheer animalistic desire and both actresses give it their all. They do an effortless job of convincing us that their characters are deeply in love, and the journey they take keeps us engaged all the way. The truth is the characters are fairly simple, it's the emotions they experience which make it so interesting, and it's what drives the intrigue and conflict. Symbolism is ever-present, especially the appearance of the colour blue, and it's easy to see what themes or emotions they're helping to reinforce. It could be shorter, it could be more concise, but in story telling terms it's a beautiful picture, aesthetically and spiritually, and the love the women share will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.",

Anyway the positives, the performances.  Genuinely wow, especially Adèle Exarchopoulos who is absolutely brilliant, you genuinely believe her performance every step of the way.

The sex scenes are very long and very plentiful, and I don't like the film any less because of them, but there came (pun intended x2) a point where I don't think anything was being gained from them, in terms of story or emotion. Seeing a lack of filter or censor added to the realism at first, but eventually it more or less felt like it was being naughty for the sake of being naughty. \"Blue is the Warmest Color\" is a film I really do want to watch again, and there's something uniquely special about it. I know there was quite a bit of drama behind-the-scenes, as it's been mentioned in almost every media report I've read about the film.

The story of a coming-of-age teenager finding and failing her first love (because of the difference in the social rank, life experience, artistic taste, or whatever weak reason the movie comes up with) is all but too old as a piece of stale cheese. Were it not for the lesbian twist, the story by itself stands no higher than any typical romantic ANIME that Japanese cranks out dozens of times every year. I would even consider You've Got Mails, Serendipity, and many other Hollywood style love dramas, blockbuster or not, way more entertaining.\n\nThe movie could've spent more time on developing the emotional and social struggle the main character goes through with her love journey, and in the process makes her character more relatable to common viewers. Yet the director or the scriptwriter or whoever has their libido unchecked decided to waste the precious time in a film in unnecessary nudity to almost porn-like details. \n\nI get why nudity is important to some love stories, because it's the rawest, most basic yet most powerful expression of love and desire human beings can convey, but an artistic depiction of sex scenes have to serve a purpose integral to the story, not just some eye-candy, or worse, marketing tools, to boost the movie sales by appealing to the audience's crotch. Yet I fail to see any necessity of the nude scenes in this film, except that it makes the motive of the main character more erotic than emotional, another fatal blow to an already weak story.\n\nPlease stop giving this movie high commendation because of your desire to be politically correct. Tagging a movie with sensitive or controversial social elements doesn't guarantee it to be a masterpiece. Quite the opposite, it often conveys the laziness of the movie-makers and lack of creativity. A true proponent of homosexual romance should voice their support through genuine stories of the complicated struggles gays and lesbians face in their life, not riding on the hype of homosexuality in the superficial hope of winning a golden statue. Otherwise, you are not supporting homosexuality, you are simply abusing it for personal gain.",

Namely, that a heterosexual man filmed two heterosexual women for the 10 minutes of screen-time, but basing some scenes off a homosexual woman's graphic novel. While there is no definitive answer of who's gender and who's orientation intersects to create this controversy, I think it's worthwhile remaining inquisitive of why those that hold power continue to tell the stories of marginalised peoples. \nDespite that, some scenes that resonated with me most were in the first half of the film - of teenagers pressuring teenagers to conform to their socially accepted gender roles, and being pressured to understand complex sexual identities, while struggling to fit in through a whole lot of confusion. As always, LGBT films continue to remain on the sidelines of mainstream cinema.

So its only fitting that Something like Blue is the warmest color take place there. One of the most extensive, honest, real romance stories one can see in this decade of the 2010's. Lea Seydoux, and Adele excharpolous bring to life two women who teach each other about love, life and happiness. Director abdellatif Kechiche gives viewers one incredible story.\n\tThe movie begins with Adele as a young teenager who does well in school but doesn't quite know who she truly is. At the same time her sexual desires are flaring at an alarming rate. She tries out a relationship with a guy which doesn't work out but then one day she meets a blue haired girl named emma who changes her life. The movie explores their relationship and all the trials and tribulations that come with it as they both come of age.\n\tKechiche brings to life this story that is raw but done in an honest fashion. Through his writing in this script and his directing, he shows every bit of what makes desire, freedom, love and passion, and heartbreak so important in everyone's lives. he even sprinkles in some philosophy and extensionalism in here to show that's a bit more than just a lesbian romance film. There are so many motifs in here such as Blue, Food, music, and of course sexuality and all its forms.\nadele exharplous performance is incredible! she has this incredibly genuine look of curiosity that she nails everytime. She showcases a true coming of age with her character and takes us on a slow but meaningful journey into the teenage angst and later full grown woman-hood. she is a young French beauty looking to define herself in some kind of way and it was breath taking to see. lea seydoux is outstanding! her acting was subtle but their purpose behind every facial experession the tone of voice and how she provided a unique and colorful aura of mystery to this woman. Blue is an alluring color and she is the embodiment of that here. Like adele she also is looking to have a fulfilling life. The breakup scene is the standout for her here. this is without a doubt seydoux best role of her career so far. \nFor me it was a beautiful display of French culture and why its one of the most romantic places in the world. The film is sexy, and intoxicating at times to watch. despite its 3 hour time limit the director hooks you with excellently timed moments that are crucial to the plot. it remded me of boyhood a bit as we see these ladies go from being girls to women in a methodically paced story. \nits very artsy too especially with all the closeup shots. The scene were adele and emma are together and looking at each other you can paint a distinct picture and can use over a thousand words to describe what they are feeling and iminating towards each other.\nThis ladies and gentlemen is a really solid French picture, one of the best I've ever seen from the country.",

It's not that a long lasting movie is a bad one, but there's plenty of scenes here that linger out for too long that don't really add anything. You can crop them out and still have the same movie.

Feeling so deeply about the story and fate of these women... and thinking about what I wished for them as if they were real people, convinced me that this film is a near perfect example of what I think film should be. Apparently I'm not alone as Even Spielberg and the jury of Cannes 2013 thought so as well. \n\nThe sex scenes (which were not as \"graphic\" as I thought they'd be based on other reviewers) were necessary in my opinion.  When you give yourself so completely to another, the way Adele gave herself to Emma, and at such a young age, it's no wonder her whole freaking life was wrecked afterward. She was literally ruined for anyone else. This is sometimes the heartbreak of life and love. \n\nI give only 4.5 stars because of the length of the movie.....wow it was way too long with some unnecessary scenes that should have been cut. However, I've heard they had close to 900 hours of footage in the end so three is doing pretty good I suppose. \n\nOverall, as a filmmaker, this movie inspired me immensely.

Adele Exarchopolous is simply astonishing as the girl who transforms from hesitant teen through the full gamut of emotions, every one beautifully displayed across her face, in her eyes, in every movement. She is utterly compelling and her journey is often heartbreaking. Lea Seydoux is also great, which makes her dismal role in Spectre all the more disappointing.\n\nMuch as I'd like to, I can't give the film 5*, because it made me feel more than a bit of  voyeur more than once. It's shot in wonderful light and gorgeous closeups throughout. Scenes of the two leads kissing in the park with the sun behind them are as beautiful as anything I've seen for a long time. But we often watch Adele sleeping, barely clothed, for quite a while. Later in the film, when explicit sex is not part of the relationship, we watch her having a shower, for no apparent reason. It feels exploitative, it feels uncomfortable. It feels unnecessary and wrong. What a shame such a fabulously-acted story is tarnished...",

            "content": "I never write movie reviews, however, I could not just sit idly by while this movie gets so many praises. As a disclaimer, in general, I mostly agree with RT reviews when it comes to movies, especially, when movies actually ARE good (The Godfather, Once Upon A Time in the West, Edge of Tomorrow, Die Hard, Rear Window, etc to name a few from various genres). So I'm not writing this for sake of going against the flow. \n\nThe movie has no real story or plot. Just a movie following the lives of two individuals, mainly Adele the primary character, who becomes attracted to another girl and explores her sexuality. If you're a moviegoer expecting an engrossing compelling story with intense drama, this is not the movie for you. The movie really drags on for 3 hours, and a lot of  scenes really serve no purpose, or at least not in an interesting way. It feels more like a soap opera/documentary in movie format, with some explicit sex scenes. If that is your cup of tea, and a soap opera lover (apparently is the case for all the positive critics on here), then by all means, enjoy this movie.\n\nA lot of reviewers praise the acting, but what acting? The actors/actresses, no offense and safe to say, are practically playing themselves or a version of themselves. The characters are one dimensional, not interesting, and are just your typical everyday teenager/young adult from France. GOOD acting, is method acting (see Marlon Brando, Gary Oldman, Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Viggo Mortensen, Vincent Cassel (french), hell even most young recent British and American talent in drama movies) and playing characters that are different and outside your comfort zone while doing so convincingly. You're not really acting when all you're doing is playing  yourself. \n\nLast thing, a lot of reviewers praise how beautiful this movie is shot. If by beautiful,you mean shooting the movie in glorious 1080p  with the most up to date camera technology (movie is from 2013), extreme closeups, etc. then sure, it's beautiful. Want beautiful cinematography? See any movie from Sergio Leone (50s-60s era), Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola, Alfonso Cuaron. TV shows like House of Cards have beautiful cinematography (with better acting and story to boot) that rival or improve on this movie in every aspect.\n\nSorry if this review comes off negative nancyish. However, the movie was just not enjoyable and quite frankly boring. It was hard to sit through the second half of the movie, when it was: more of the same, but for another hour and a half.\nMy 2 cents.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Irgendwie ist die erste Liebe für jeden gleich. Abdel Kechiche erzählt genau so eine Geschichte der ersten Liebe und des ersten Mals, tut das aber derartig detailliert, dass ein Epos daraus wurde. Wir erleben eine Gir-Meets-Girl Geschichte von sagenhaften drei Stunden! Diese Zeit zieht auch nicht einfach so an uns vorbei. Kechiche, der eine Grafic Novel von Julie Maroh verfilmt, verlangt von uns, sich in jedes Detail einzufühlen. Es gibt unzählige Filme wie diesen, keiner aber wurde derartig ambitioniert und umfassend erzählt! Adele (Adele Exarchopoulos, übrigens die Cousine von unserem DJ Christos Excarchopoulos!) ist eine Schülerin aus der Vorstadt von Lille. Eines Tages erwidert sie den Blick einer Unbekannten (Lea Seydoux) und der trifft sie wie ein Blitzschlag! Die Unbekannte wirkt wie eine Rebellin mit blauem Haar und hält eine andere Frau fest umschlungen. Adele fasst sich ein Herz und sucht die Unbekannte nachts in Clubs - und findet sie tatsächlich! Ihr Name ist Emma, sie ist Kunststudentin und wartet schon bald vor der Schule auf Adele. Emma macht ihr den Hof, aber für Adele ist es nicht leicht, ihren Gefühlen zu folgen. Von den Klassenkameradinnen wird sie beschimpft. Zwischen den beiden Mädchen wächst aber das Begehren und die Wissbegierde: Vor dem ersten Kuss sprechen sie über Sartre. Marivaux stand Pate bei der Geschichte (die wie im Roman in zwei Kapitel untergliedert wird) und die Klassiker haben Regisseur Abdellatif Kechiche bereits in früheren Filmen inspiriert. Bei Marivaux stellt die Entdeckung der Liebe alle sozialen Strukturen in Frage - auch Adele und Emma gehören unterschiedlichen Schichten an. Dass Emma gebildeter ist, reisst aber keine Kluft auf zwischen den Beiden, sondern spornt Adele an. Die Symetrie von Kechiches Film dient dazu, dass Adele alle wichtigen Erfahrungen zwei Mal machen kann, angefangen mit dem ersten Kuss, den sie einer Frau schenkt. Ganz langsam wird die erste Liebesnacht vorbereitet, doch bis dahin, stellt der Film eine Intensität her, dass wir meinen, Adele schon gut zu kennen. Das Glück der Beiden wird als einziger Rausch festgehalten und zum Glück schenkt Kechiche diesem Genuss weite Passagen in La vie d'Adele! Emma und Adele lieben sich, dann essen sie Austern und trinken Champagner. Schnitt. Ein paar Jahre sind vergangen, beide wohnen zusammen. Adele hat sich ihren Traum erfüllt und arbeitet als Lehrerin, Emma malt. Doch ein Seitensprung erschüttert die Beziehung, in der bereits zuvor langsam die Leidenschaft entwichen war... Seit La vie d'Adele die Goldene Palme in Cannes gewann und sich die Darstellerinnen über die miesen Arbeitsbedingungen beschwerten, ist es fast nebensächlich geworden, über den Film an sich zu diskutieren: Ja, Kechiche zeigt eine lesbische Liebesgeschichte aus männlich heterosexueller Perspektive. Ja, wir erleben zwei ausserordentlich attraktive Mädchen im Bett. Es ist doch aber ein Unterschied, die gesunde Liebe zweier Mädchen zu zeigen, als darüber anzüglich zu grinsen! Dieser Vorwurf trifft Kechiche nicht! Sein Film wirkt auf mich auch nicht wie eine Provokation, sondern einfach wie ein Manifest der Liebe! Ganz egal, wer hier wen liebt! Wie bemerkt: Die erste Liebe ist für jeden gleich. (Dazu haben wir für euch eine Film List mit den schönsten Liebesfilmen verfasst auf der Empfehlungsseite unserer Videothek cinegeek.de",

I was nervous about watching it and my best friend was surprised that I was even going to do this. So when I first watched it, I actually loved it and was quite something that was different to me. I actually would've typed the review for it, but I was nervous about it and just wussed out. After watching My Summer of Love and typed that out, I started to man up and try to watch the film again whenever I get the time for it as it had been a while, and review it. Even if I didn't finish it, I'll still get enough information to make a review. So after all that, Blue is the Warmest Color is a fantastic romance that is definitely the way to make a good romance that is drama. Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos are excellent and their chemistry is very realistic and interesting. When I first saw that it was 3 hours long, o was surprised and was worried that the movie could've stretched it too much, but it went by fast as the movie got me invested and I wouldn't think that it was long. The writing is very well done, and there are some moments that were unexpected, which made me learn more about it. The characters are very three-dimensional and are also memorable. Blue is the Warmest Color is a clever film that doesn't run out of strings and goes in the realistic approach.",

Going into this movie I was a little intimidated by the fact that it was three hours long, let alone the fact that it is in French! However, I quickly got past that.\nIt is a beautiful story. There may be too much sex for my taste, but I can't complain when the story was so beautifully portrayed. It was heartbreaking to say the least. I think one of the things I enjoyed the most though was the length. Yes, the three hours was intimidating at first, and it did move slowly, but I enjoyed that. All the shots seemed to linger too long or not long enough. Yet the whole movie ran slow enough for you to feel like you were living life alongside Adele and Emma and not just watching it. The length of the movie was necessary to keep up the natural progression.\nAlso that ending was so heartbreaking. The last half hour alone was a roller coaster, but the last two minutes specifically left me almost angry there wasn't more. Of all the places to end the movie... Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this movie if you are under 18, but otherwise I'd recommend anyone to give it a watch. It is raw, but beautiful. And don't let the length or language hold you back. Ten minutes in and you are already used to reading subtitles.",

            "content": "I have yet to see a movie as honest in its romance as \"Blue Is The Warmest Color,\" a modern-day arthouse masterpiece likely to change the way the unruly cinematic landscape looks decades after its release.  The winner of 2013's Palme d'Or, it is the kind of film that lands not with a thud but with a bang, a controversial tour-de-force likely to be considered a \"great\" in future generations, like the way we look at \"Day for Night\" or \"That Obscure Object of Desire\" now.  Here is a coming-of-age film that depicts every scar on the mind and the body of its leading actress - an \"event\" doesn't designate her transition from childhood to adulthood but the existence of a long lasting first love, a first serious relationship. \n\tHer name is Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos, giving one of the greatest performances of the 2010s), who, as the film opens, is a fifteen-year-old desperate for love but also in the painful throes of questioning her sexuality.  Her friends, gossipy and immature, talk about boys as if they're the only conversational topic to exist; Adèle cannot help but daydream through their monotonous tell-alls.  While part of her carries a passion for the opposite sex, something in her budding carnality suggests otherwise.  She has a brief fling with an affectionate schoolmate, but after passing an ethereally beautiful blue-haired young woman (Léa Seydoux) on the street, she realizes that her desires are targeted in the direction of the female gender.\n\tAfter much contemplation, she decides to make her curiosities a reality by visiting a lesbian bar, where the very same azure-maned woman, Emma, is coincidentally also attending.  Seeing her alone and looking hopelessly lost, the latter gently begins conversation, which, in turn, spirals into a torrid affair that acts as Adèle's very first real relationship.  The union lasts years, and, as \"Blue Is The Warmest Color\" is three-hours in length, we see every aspect of their romance, warts, euphorias, and all.\n\tAnd when I say we see everything, I mean everything.  The biggest conversation point regarding the film has to do with its graphic, lengthy sex scenes, which are extremely provocative and, depending on who you ask, extremely exploitative.  \"Blue Is The Warmest Color\" is one of my favorite cinematic experiences of the past year, but I cannot give Abdellatif Kechiche a hall pass, despite his mostly brilliant direction - he gets much too carried away, as if he realized just how much control he had over these two breathtaking actresses and figured that making a quasi-porno for himself would be a crime easy to get away with.  \n\tBut as \"Blue Is The Warmest Color\" is epic in length, the sex scenes, a combination of wildly uncomfortable and wildly titillating, do not much hinder the overall experience of the film: voyeuristic and all too real.  We feel as though we're experiencing first love ourselves, deliriously happy during its best moments and embarrassingly pressed to shed tears during its worst.  Kechiche's excellent decision to photograph the film mostly in close-ups only adds to the intimacy we feel toward Adèle and Emma; we experience \"Blue Is The Warmest Color\" through them.  It is one of the few films where we feel as though the actresses are controlling its success, not the director.\n\tExarchopoulos and Seydoux give two of the finest performances of the past ten years.  Never have I seen a relationship portrayed with such passion, such rawness - their initial meet-cute, as well as their climactic, sensationally acted break-up, are more convincing than anything I've ever witnessed in film.  We feel the love Adèle has for Emma, and vice versa, both thoroughly different yet three-dimensionally portrayed.  They are actresses that only come along every once in a while, blowing our minds away as they remain magnetic in a Monica Vitti sort of way.  The fact that this is the first leading film role for the overwhelmingly talented Exarchopoulos is astonishing - at 20, she bears more nuance than actresses double her age.\n\tBy the film's end, \"Blue Is The Warmest Color\" will leave you emotionally stunted, so severely knocked off your feet that it wouldn't be much of a surprise if you find your feet in a theater fifty miles away.  Films as wonderful as this come but once in a lifetime - it is a game-changer, an earth-shatterer.",

            "content": "Forget, for a moment, that \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" is the story about two women in love.  Here is a movie so universal in its themes and so broad in its emotions that it could really be about people of any gender, race or sexual orientation.  While Hollywood films simply prattle on about love while merely copying sitcom nonsense, here is a French film that will mean something to anyone who has ever had the pleasure and the pain of being in love.\n\n\"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" was the winner of Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May, and has been the center of media attention due to a pair of scenes depicting the two female lovers engaged in graphic sex that has - how does one put this nicely? - a very French sensibility.  It is true.  We see the lovers naked, laid bare with little to hide, particularly during the first of two encounters, an eye-opening seven-minute scene of raw sexuality in which the bodies twist this way and that in a manner that might make some viewers uncomfortable.  Yet, while those scenes are striking, it is the film that surrounds these two women that captures our imagination.  For all the news of scenes of sweaty sexual fumblings, the most tantalizing organ on display is the human heart.\n\nBased on a graphic novel by Julie Morah, \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" tells the story of Adèle and Emma, two intelligent and heartfelt people who, through simple cosmic fate, fall desperately in love.  The movie sees their relationship over the course of a decade, mostly through the eyes of Adèle, a pretty 17 year-old high school girl with pouty lips and an expression that suggests a great deal of unhappiness.  She's that very rare teenager who always seems to be waiting for something.  Her classmates live in the moment, but Adèle seems to be searching for some kind of meaning in her life.  As the film opens, her eyes suggest that she is lost in the world.  When the movie is over she will have the same look in her eyes, but for a completely different reason.\n\nAt school, she has a circle of friends but they seem distant somehow.  She tries to touch the social strata but nothing really engages her.  She begins dating a nice guy named Samir.  They talk and before long she shares his bed.  Something in her eyes in their post-sexual encounter seems sad.  The parts are there but, in her mind, there seems to be a sexual component that is missing here.  The relationship doesn't last long and she breaks his heart.\n\nThen something happens.  While walking with her friends one day, she passes a blue-haired girl on the street walking the other way.  It is only a passing glance but, for Adèle, it leaves a startling impression.  This parting glace stays on her mind for days and days until one night, while out with friends, she makes an unexpected left turn into a gay bar hoping the find the girl.  She does, and they begin to talk.  The girl is Emma, a pretty college student who is studying art.  Emma and Adèle talk a lot.  They talk about art, about music, about philosophy, about themselves.  They talk about their dreams.  Adèle reveals that she wants to be an elementary school teacher; Emma wants to be an artist.  Days later, on a park bench, they pause in their conversation and share a kiss.  They go home and have sex.  Afterwards they talk some more.  Adèle finds her life turned around, especially by her former friends who cruelly interrogate her for hanging around with a lesbian - a reminder that even as open as we are about homosexuality, a social stigma still exists.\n\nWhat is happening between Emma and Adèle is a building relationship that will last for several years.  The miraculous thing is that the story is constructed in such a realistic way that we never know where it is going.  Director Abdellatif Kechiche shoots the film in a way that makes us feel as if we are standing in the room with the characters.  There are no glossy, pretty images.  When they sit at dinner, we are sitting at the table with them.  Kechine gets in close, and allows us to get to know the characters intimately.  He is an expert at photographing the landscape of the human face in close-up so that every emotional tic is on display.  We come to care about the fate of these two girls and it pays off in the film's climax, a heart-rending moment that will break your heart as the lovers realize what their fate must be.  The weight of that moment stands for the fate of all lovers in crisis.  What they do with that moment determines the destinies for both.\n\nTo understand what a remarkable achievement this film is, you have to see it in relation to most other movie love stories.  Other films want to throw problems at the characters that are there to be solved.  The problems for Adèle and Emma are borne out of their personalities.  Not one moment in this film feels phony or contrived.  It moves with the rhythms of real life and ends on a welcomed, life-goes-on note that leaves us with something to talk about afterwards.  This is one of the best films of the year.",

Now that I've seen it my head and my heart are so full of feelings, I don't know what to do with myself.\n\nHow could I have missed this film? It is the kind of movie only the French know how to make - real, raw, unapologetic without any gimmicks or manipulation and so brilliantly acted, I really want to know where these actors get their training.\n\nBoth female leads are phenomenal, but Adèle Exarchopoulos is a revelation. I have never seen an actor, male or female, being able to express so much with so few words. The girl is brilliant. I want to find everything she's been in and binge-watch her act.\n\nI was reminded today why I so revere French cinema. No one makes better films about virtually nothing more than the characters' experiences and their innermost thoughts and turmoil. I can go on all night about the merits of this beautiful, heartbreaking film. \n\nJust an FYI if anyone decides they want to see it - the film has several rather lengthy and thoroughly explicit lesbian sex scenes (I've seen my fair share of European films, but never anything like it). I wasn't bothered by them and found them integral to the story as a whole.\n\nBeautiful, gripping, exquisite film.",

May be, Kechiche that's why chose the name 'Adele' (means \"justice\" in arabic).\nAdele is having sexual fluctuations, her Kinsey scale changes continuously and no one understands her, even Emma threw her away. Emma's behaviour turns out in cafe scene with Adele which I consider great scene of the movie, because we know that Emma also yearns for, but is now having relationship with other woman and can't do anything towards this barrier.\nAdele says that everything settled between her and Emma, that they're in peace. But Adele's destiny is unclouded and even at the end she still alone and 'lousy' (as hopeless), which it is Emma as being 'lousy' (being bad) actually.",

But work it does.\n\nAdele is just entering adulthood when she meets the green-haired proud dyke, Emma. This is a beautiful, bold and highly erotic study of sexuality and love. \n\nThe sexuality goes well past the restrictions of the American R-Rating. But it is essential that the sex and sensuality be graphically depicted. At it's core this is a story of obsession, passion and love which is almost too closely attached to sex. As the two young women grow into full adulthood, each wants more and different things. It is not even entirely clear if Adele is \"lesbian\" as we seem to want to apply it. She loves Emma and all of the pleasure she gives her. But despite her protestations, it seems that something is missing for both women. \n\nBeautifully shot and exceptionally well acted. The film is about realistic as any film can hope to be. Nothing happens beyond the realm of the banal. \n\nThe two lovers come to a point in their relationship that all of us have experienced in our 20's -- straight or gay. Sometimes what we think is \"love\" is something altogether different. Or is it? \n\nThe film offers a restraint romanticism. It is tinged with bittersweet nostalgia and humanity. \n\nSince the film's release both actors have expressed concerns that  Abdel Kechiche manipulated and exploited them. I suppose this is possible, but it smells more like fear of taking ownership of full-on sexual performances. Nothing ever \"feels\" uncomfortable or exploitive. \n\nThis is a beautiful film about human need and the changes that come with growing into our individual selves.",

Léa Seydoux was 26 years old and Adèle Exarchopoulos was 18 years old respectively when the movie was shot. Adèle's performance competes to performance of the French big star Léa Seydoux.\nDirector Abdel Kechiche repeats hundreds of takes searching for reality. The two actresses are allowed to read the script only once and they were expected to improvise. No makeup artist was available and they played almost without makeup. They told that they could produce reality by being pushed hard and struggling in their performance. The accumulated shooting time was as much as 800 hours and took 5 month, three months more than the planned two months.\nDetailed depiction is apparent in Adèle's fight scenes with classmates and her girl friend. Length of these scenes are more than twice of the common movies and they are spectacular with heated performances.\nAdèle Exarchopoulos looks like a naive girl in the beginning but audiences are soon surprised at her bold performance of sex. However it is not right to see the movie as a pornography by movie stars but it portrays a growing girl vividly. Director Abdel Kechiche found Adèle Exarchopoulos has habits, like playing with her hair, which are observed in growing girls or incomplete women and introduced them into the main character.\nIn addition, Adèle's eating and sleeping scenes between shooting intervals are aggressively used so that name of main charter was changed from Clémentine to Adèle, the actress's name which also became a part of the movie title.There are many scenes in which Adèle eats something including she eats while crying. These scenes are important as Adèle Exarchopoulos tells she got the role because of her way of eating. These scenes gives strong impressions of vitality which the 18-year-old girl has.\nShe eats even while crying. She jumps into homosexual love as soon as she found she loves her girl friend. She fights against classmates who discriminate. She attends demonstrations. She cries and resist when breakup with her girl friend. All of these are outburst of her vitality which competes to one-year-long characterization of Léa Seydoux with Director Abdel Kechiche.\nI see the real strength of the French movies. I also look forward to \nAdèle Exarchopoulos's future as an actress though she was lucky to be directed nicely.",

Now one of the actress Adèle Exarchopoulos that I never seen before in anything until this and I got to say that she is a actress I would like to see in more roles showing off her talent. I have seen Léa Seydoux before in movies like Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, Midnight in Paris, The Grand Budapest Hotel and Inglorious Bastards, and just like I said about Adèle Exarchopoulos I would like to see Léa Seydoux in more movie and well she is going to be in Spectre so there's that.\n\nThe director of the movie Abdellatif Kechiche directs this movie so incredibly well and so magnificent that he understood teenagers today how they really act. It wasn't like Hollywood movies that normally get it totally wrong and have no clue on what teenagers are like today because Hollywood are just a studio with their heads up their own ass and have no clue on reality, then comes this movie that's not from a big Hollywood studio but from a different country and a different director who actually have touch of reality on it's characters and how young people discovering their sexuality, and that's why Abdellatif Kechiche pretty much made this movie work.\n\nNow I hear a lot of people saying that this movie is basically porn with the two lesbian and them having...you know what I'm talking about. Now here's the thing porn is basically not real and what I mean is that the actors are getting paid to do they business and the whole meaning of porn is to watch these people who probably don't know each other or don't really like each that much but they have sex anyway and after the video is done they get paid and off they go. Blue is the Warmest Color dose have sex scenes that you would find on PornHub if I have to be honest but it's more than just, the movie brilliantly shows a relationship, a break up, how much they love each other or do they love each other. It's things like this that isn't rocket science to work out and some people are making false arguments over pointless things in movies, some people are so stupid sometimes.\n\nThe writing was realistic and brilliant, the movie is 3 hours long and it flew by me just like that.\n\nNow for problems: I haven't got that much to say when it comes to problems but if I have to really think of the things that I didn't like is that there are some scenes that I felt didn't really belong there and felt a bit fill, and that's it for problems, you see how small my problem was.\n\nBlue is the Warmest Color may not be a easy watch for some people but it shows a realistic look on sexuality and young people today that I think is what makes this movie great from start till the very end.",

Very naturalistic take on a same sex relationship with the long running time devoted to small character and dialogue scenes.

            "content": "Didn't particularly like this movie. For one thing, I found both characters in the couple rather irritating in different ways. The main character, Adele, is not the most dynamic personality, seeming to have only one facial expression throughout the movie. The love interest, Emma, is cold, pretentious and kind of a bad person, hardly deserving of the doe-eyed love and devotion that Adele pours out upon her. At times I felt as though Emma was using Adele, callously hurting her while turning a blind eye - not really the close loving relationship that I was hoping to find.\n\nBesides the unappealing nature of the relationship (in my opinion), the movie was also waaaay too long and just kept plodding on with unnecessarily drawn-out, unedited scenes. I felt like half the movie took place inside a classroom, a dance club or a domestic location (inside a living room or bed room) with us the viewers just blankly observing since nothing much is ever happening. It was also one of the quietest movies I've ever watched, with NO music, no sound effects and hardly any dialogue that reaches above a mild conversational tone.\n\nStill, it was an insightful look into a unique kind of relationship, and I enjoyed it in many respects. Some of the relationship scenes were among the most powerful and believable I've seen in a movie, and the movie certainly left a deep impression upon my emotional memory.\n\nBottom line: If they'd made the two characters a bit more likeable and cut out about half the movie (come on, it's over 3 hours! There are a whole smattering of love scenes lasting probably more than five minutes apiece... That's ridiculous.), this would've been a great movie. As it is, it is good but leaves something to be desired.",

I mean, I respect that the director shows a lesbian sex scene after seeing hundreds of heterosexual sex scenes in movies history but come on that just looked like a porno.

            "content": "Seventeen year old Adele's life is changed when she meets Emma, a sapphire haired university student, and her path changes from adrift high school student to a woman discovering herself and sexuality in Blue is the Warmest Color.\n\nBeautiful and honest, Blue is the Warmest Color is a realistic love story. I find it quite hard to say what it is about without it sounding banal. Adele is a confused girl, unfulfilled in her life, trying to figure out what she desires. Then, girl meets girl, girl likes girl, girl falls for girl, and girl's relationship with girl follows its destined course. In the meantime, girl comes to grips with her desire, sexuality and identity. But it is poignant, sweet, sad, unflinching,\n\nThe more naive and inexperienced of the two is Adele, played by Adele Exarchopoulos. She does a wonderful job of being both unsure and youthfully headstrong.  I enjoyed her character being so blase about pretenses and frivolity in the superficial. She is hilarious to watch eat food, Adele ravenously devours meals as if her appetite for sustenance is insatiable. Emma, played by Lea Seydoux, is the slightly older college student who Adele befriends, at first as a confidante and mild mentor, but soon that friendship evolves. Emma is free-spirited and confident without being pretentious or judgmental and Seydoux's character warrants Adele's infatuation.\n\nThe film is raw, the sex scenes enthralling without being gratuitous and what you get essentially from Blue is the Warmest Color is a coming of age lesbian love story.",

If you enjoy a solidly paced, well layered picture, Blue is the Warmest Color is a film that is sure to delight viewers that want a richly detailed plot with immaculate performances. The film is not for everyone, as the content might be a bit too much, but for those who want a well executed drama that is well layed in a way that it steadily unfolds before you, this is a terrific drama that tells a great story that is quite simple, yet engaging due to its cast who are terrific in their roles. The film is nothing too elaborate, but that's what makes this film standout. Using simple ideas, the filmmakers were able to get the most out of the film's story with such a simply idea. This is a terrific film, one that is steadily executed in the sense that it unfolds slowly before your eyes so that you become more attached with the movie's characters. Blue is the Warmest Color is a film well worth your time if you enjoy the genre. For such a simple story, Blue is the Warmest color is superb cinema, a film that does so much with so little, and it is a film well worth your time if you enjoy these films. There a few aspects of the film that could have been improved upon. However, there are enough great elements at work on-screen to make this a well executed drama that is worth seeing.",

The sex scenes themselves add to the shock factor and \"controversy\" to the film giving it an edginess that most viewers enjoy. There is no deeper meaning in the plot. It is just the boring story of a couple. There are many side-plots that were introduced, but abandoned leaving me unfulfilled and confused.

Compared to other long movies, Blue holds the length fairly well, but it's easy to look back and see lots of things that could be snipped without impacting anything.\n\nThe movie spans a number of years. The actual timeframe covered is only coyly hinted at, making it hard to truly grasp the  emotional impact.\n\nBut perhaps time doesn't matter. After all, we can plainly see on the screen how the relationship is unfolding and the direction its heading. \n\nHowever, all that aside, the real beauty within Blue is how the director manages to capture the awkward moments in life. There is almost a reverence to the way these snippets are filmed, whether it is Adele's father asking her girlfriend \"if she has a boyfriend\" or the way spaghetti is in no way an elegant food to eat. Or the absurd--yet intimate--way two people grapple at each other while in bed. Maybe the blinks of exhaustion while standing in front of a classroom of kids who aren't writing their lines.\n\nFor someone who is slightly uncomfortable with life, a bit shy, who feels out of sorts with the verbose nature of society, Adele's face acts as a mirror. She reflects those things we feel; the uncertainty of whether that girl likes us, or whether our opinion is being laughed at, or whether what we feel is valid. It's a delightfully nuanced performance and she captivates the screen from the first shot.",

The film is too long at three hours and even though it gives you much more time to get behind the characters, I don't feel every minute of it was needed. The sex scenes are also extremely graphic and I really commend the actresses for being brave enough to participate. The Adele character is super sweet and has a smile that will light up a room, while the exotic Emma acts as a forbidden fruit and the passion flows freely between them.

With its pornographic scenes so explicit that it feels more like a Hustler production Blue is the Warmest Color is oddly appealing when the story is taken from the bedroom and set in the streets of France. While I am not a advocate of the homosexual lifestyle Blue is the Warmest Color is the one film dealing with the subject that I didn't feel completely uncomfortable viewing perhaps due to the superb acting and strong narrative voice that focuses more on the human relationship rather than the gay rights movement. However even as good as it was at times it drug and timing in at three hours is something I really only enjoy in an epic action movie like Gladiator or Braveheart.",

The cast is pretty brilliant, especially the focus character played by Exarchopoulos, giving a truthful, dedicated performance to every scene, as the direction and writing blends together making a very believable whole. At about 3 hours long the run time is far too excessive for any love story (I've never seen so much pasta eating before), as ten minutes will pass every so often and very little, or indeed anything will really happen, but certain parts are truly gut-wrenchingly painful owing to the fact that the relationship from the very beginning is utterly credible, which is something not many movies ever really pull off, or even get close. For a select, patient audience this is worth 3 hours of time, but frankly it's pushing it, and I very much doubt I'll watch it again any time soon.

I liked the premise of an adolescent girl struggling with her sexuality and finding herself. The second half, however, was just post-break up melodrama that ran on and on and then ended, leaving me with nothing. And I know I'm not the only one who believes the sex scenes were WAAAAYYYYYY too long, unnecessary, and abundant. If you want to have a single long sequence sex scene to establish a first-time passionate connection, then okay, maybe. But each subsequent sex scene served to basically remind us that they're lesbians who like sex. It's redundant and cheap. There is nothing about a tender human connection that you will establish with a softcore porn scene that an implied foreplay-fade into next morning scene won't. They were hot and all, but decide what you want the film to be and get back to me.",

So I pirated it from a wonderful website called PornHub.com. I was unimpressed. Unlike one of my favorite genre films, Back Door Butt Fuck Sluts Gone Nuts Vol. XXVII, it did not deliver on the \"all anal action,\" \"freaky lesbians playing with their toys,\" and \"hours of eleven-inch strap-on pelvic thrusts,\" like it was advertised to have. In fact, very little of this film featured the \"erotic girl-on-girl action\" that my colleagues stated it did. \n\nAlthough I do like my porn to have a story to it, this porno takes far too long to get around to the actual sex. And when it does, the performers are clearly amateurs. I mean, they don't even use a real vagina! It's a prosthetic! Do I look stupid? I have been watching and reviewing films of this genre ever since I hit puberty, so don't act like I can't tell the difference between a rubber vagina and a real one. Ridiculous. These girls need to get down and dirty if they expect me to pay attention. \n\nThis film is fine overall, but pales in comparison to such classics of the genre as Dyke Hard, When Harry Ate Sally, and Call of Booty: Modern Whorefare. Unlike those masterpieces, this film contains very little graphic strap-on penetration, scissoring, fisting, and hardcore sex of any kind. What a disappointment. Also, what kind of a name is \"Blue is the Warmest Color?\" It should have had a far more inventive title than that. Saturday Night Beaver? Cumming to America? The Lord of the Anal Beads? You guys seriously passed all of these up? \n\nOverall, I give Blue is the Warmest Color 4 out of 10 stars. It's not that bad once you get past how tame it all is, but there's still far too much talking and nearly none of the hardcore sex that films of this genre should have. Prudish movies like this might have been okay for the 1950s, but nowadays, we should expect more.",

But the movie was a fascinating tale of love (lesbian love, but I personally could care less what kind of love).  Adèle Exarchopoulos was every bit as beautiful as I expected and her acting was wonderful.\nFor me, the major negatives were the believability of some parts of the story line.  For example, Adele is attacked by one of her high school class mates after they find out she went to a gay bar and apparently met someone, but the attack occurs in the presence of her openly gay friend and his boyfriend.  \nThe story though, clearly is the story of young love and as another reviewer put it so perfectly, \"love can be exhilarating and devastating\" and in my view, it so often is both.",

She has a consistent face of boredom that is unable to bring a spark to the character (although I think Lea Seydoux is wonderfully alive and real). The other part of the blame I put on the director. I am not at all offended by the sexual content of the film, but I do believe he films the sexual desires in a way that does not influence the emotions of the film, primarily becomes he seems obsessed with butt shots.

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Colour was explained to me by a friend as a 3 hour film featuring a 10 minute lesbian sex scene and one of the women from Inglorious Basterds. As she is a talented actress, that was the selling point for me.\n\nThere is a lot to say about a film like Blue is the Warmest Colour because it's a hell of an experience. I will admit that its length bothered me a bit because especially within the last hour I found that the length had caught up with me. And the effect of the final hour was mostly about coming to terms with things and it went on at a rather more slow pace than the rest of the film, so Blue is the Warmest Colour indeed is a bit of a stretch. But still, it was an exceptional film.\nTo be Frank, Blue is the Warmest Colour is unforgettable because it is raw and honest. It isn't in the slightest bit afraid to tackle real relationships as they transition from experimenting to healthy adult love without skimping on the sexual nature of them. And thanks to the directional skill of Abdellatif Keniche, it goes through its complex story piece by piece without skipping over anything important. It allows viewers to analyse all the elements of its protagonist Adele's life and how they contribute to the making of her as a person and a woman. It explores the complicated theme of identity crisis and love without ever falling into formulaic, predictable or melodramatic territory and in the process manages to educate viewers and truly stimulate thoughts within them. Blue is the Warmest Colour has a big story to tell and respects its viewers enough to tell it without lying about the truth in its relationships and the importance of the sexual nature of them. I learned a lot about love from Blue is the Warmest Colour, more than I could learn from most romantic films. I learned so much that it was nearly overwhelming to take in. I walked away from Blue is the Warmest Colour mesmerised by all the love within the film and put into making it, and it reminds us just what real films are all about.\nBlue is the Warmest Colour is a visually striking film. It's cinematography and scenery is beautiful, but most importantly it captures the true beauty of the human form. The camera is constantly focused on the faces of the actors, when they are thinking and when they are eating. Every movement of the actors is artistic, and director Abdellatif Keniche knows this and plays it to the film's benefit. The cinematography is always either still or panning along nicely, and when it pans actors the bodies of its two lead actresses we pick up on every beautiful quality of them. Their smiles, their eyes, their skin. Blue is the Warmest Colour features the cinematography usually reserved for an erotic film, and it is used so perfectly that it elevates the style of the film above simple erotic cinema or pornography. The visual style of Blue is the Warmest Colour is unforgettable.\nSome of the finest scenes are the ones involving sexual activity. They capture the true face of pleasure on both actors involved, and they skin across the beauty of the form if each person. Most of the time, both figures are women. And in the style of the artwork within the film which is largely focused on the beauty of the female form within the movie, Blue is the Warmest Colour conveys why females are considered to be figures of such beauty without objectifying them by putting excessive emphasis on them it genitals as a pornography would. The beauty of the female human form has never been captured as perfectly on film as it is in Blue is the Warmest Colour, and the work of cinematography master Sofian El Fani is unforgettable.\nThe symbolism is also excellent. The title of the film gave me an inkling too keep an eye out for the colour blue, and in actuality the colour has never been more vibrant on the cinematic screen than in was in Blue is the Warmest Colour. It was so energetic everywhere, and while blue was around everything felt, as the title would suggest, warm. The colour begins to decrease in the second half of the film as the dramatic aspects become more and more negative, and the film ends on a note of only one frame of blue in sight. The atmosphere of the film is determined by many things, but one things that surprisingly perfects it with symbolism is through its use of the colour blue. The symbolism in Blue is the Warmest colour is exceptional and very surprising, and it makes the film more of a visual treat than it already was.\nBlue is the Warmest Colour is packed to the brim with unforgettable imagery, and that is one of the things that makes it beautiful. But it is also unforgettable due to the skill of the cast.\n\nQuite frankly, the lead performance of Adele Exarchopulos is one of the most ambitious female performances I have ever seen in my life. Adele Exarchopulos proves herself to be an absolutely fearless actress and gives one of the best female performances I have ever seen in the history of cinema. As the lead actress who has to carry the film through 179 minutes, she is the source of the importance in the story as it revolves all around her. But by establishing herself as one of this generation's next great actresses she carries it all the way to the end, not afraid to let loose her emotions from within or show off her body. Adele Exatchopulos gives a performance so real and so open that she hides nothing, and that creates a feeling that suggests Blue is the Warmest Colour isn't even a film. She makes it perfectly real with the brutal honesty of her lead performance which audiences are likely to find themselves so connected to that they are empathising for her and feeling what she is. She makes Blue is the Warmest Colour a great three hour experience, and she is a thoroughly beautiful and talented actress. Her performance and appearance is like a mix of Lauren Ambrose in Six Feet Under and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. By that I mean that her character Adele has a youthful energy which is also burdened by her own uncertainties and insecurities. There is a lot to learn from Blue is the Warmest Colour, and Adele Exarchopulos teaches us most of it without even saying much. A lot of the time it is just her alone and yet her emotions are expressed visually perfectly.\nHer performance is followed closely by the immense talents of Lea Seydoux whose performance is one where she holds nothing back. It is easy to tell that Emma is a character with a lot of love in her, and as the story grows more and more, so does she. You can see the dramatic aspects of her character gradually becoming more and more predominant as the story develops until the dramatic climax of the film takes place, and the whole time she has a grip over audiences. Lea Seydoux is an excellent lead alongside Adele Exatchopulos and she is both very sexy and very sweet, and audiences are likely to fall in love with her the same way Adele does. Lea Seydoux is another powerful cast member in Blue is the Warmest Colour, and her chemistry with Adele Exartchopulos is packed with a lot of genuine emotion which is essentially a shock to see because of how powerfully honest it is. The love they share has got to be real to some extent in real life, because it is actually that good.\n\nSo Blue is the Warmest Colour is long and somewhat slow, but it is a beautiful romantic film which is full of amazing acting and an unforgettable visual style which is likely to leave viewers amazed and educated on the true nature of love and adult relationships, as well as the complications of the female psyche when facing identity crisis.",

As far as the controversy that surrounds the film goes, it really doesn't matter. We're at such a point, where you'd think sexual material, no matter how graphic is no big deal. Obviously there's a lot of people who feel differently, but oh well. This is probably the best film I've ever seen, when it comes down to showing honest emotion, both joy and sadness. A lot of that has to do with the remarkable performance from Adele Exarchopoulos. \n\nBlue Is the Warmest Color follows Adele, a bright and beautiful high school student. Her friends are pressuring her to lose her virginity to a senior who has his eyes on her. On her way to a date with him, she sees a blue haired girl and it's love at first sight, only she doesn't really know it yet. The blue haired girl ends up making an appearance in her dreams that night though. She continues to see the boy and does lose her virginity to him, but that only makes her realize that she hasn't truly found what she needs. She ends up running into the blue haired girl again, at a lesbian bar, and learns that her name is Emma. They hit it off and soon start a passionate love affair. From there, it follows their relationship for about the next decade.\n\nThis is a long movie, around three hours, but it sure doesn't feel it. The dialogue is beautiful, as is the camera work, and the movie as a whole. It's about connection, love, and finding ones sexual identity. The beauty of the film is in the relationship between Adele and Emma, and both actresses give phenomenal, honest, and emotional performances. Lea Seydoux, who plays Emma, is tremendous, but like I said before this movie really belongs to Adele. \n\nBlue Is the Warmest Color certainly isn't a movie for the close minded or for moviegoers that are turned off by graphic sexual scenes and dialogue. For anyone who can put that aside and look at the movie for what it truly is, a masterpiece and one of the best films about love ever; it's quite the experience. It's a movie that won't leave me.

            "content": "\"Blue is the warmest color that you'll ever do...\" Oh hey, that actually fits into a decent rhyme scheme, so you definitely know that I wasn't going to pass up an opportunity to make that reference, as surely as this film doesn't pass up any opportunities to get all artistically audacious and defiant of those pesky censors. Man, you know that there is some creep out there who is getting pumped up about the idea of three explicit hours of teenaged French girls getting together, and I'm going to tell you right now that the creep in question must not watch a whole lot of French cinema. Yeah, for me, this seems to be something else for the Europeans to somehow make boring, and you should know what you're getting into once you see that this film is three hours long and unanimously won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Well, jeez, this actually sounds like a masterpiece or something, and last year's winner, \"Amour\", stood to be more tedious, with the preceding year's winner, \"The Tree of Life\" actually being pretty good. Huh, well, I suppose Cannes isn't going to just up and give one of the film industry's more prestigious awards to any given \"Holy Motors\" that French snobs excrete, which is good, because if an art film is three hours long, for the lesbians, it better be good. Well, it isn't quite there, but as sure as blue is actually a pretty cold color... or col[u]u[/u]r (Europeans, qu'allez-vous faire?), this film isn't exactly three hours wasted, but boy, it's something of a challenge, for a number of reasons.\r\n\r\nArt dramas of this nature always work to get off the traditional beat and path with storytelling, and at this point, the unconventionality has itself become formulaic, so as if this film's storytelling style isn't bland enough by it's own right, it's yet more of the same-old-same-old, progressing the usual way as an interpretation of a story concept that, for that matter, isn't even all that refreshing, or, well, meaty. In a lot of ways, storytelling tries to be as grounded as it can get, and it tends to succeed a little too thoroughly, even in concept, as the idea behind this arguably overly realist character meditation isn't quite juicy enough to either justify a sprawling length or compensate for other questionable storytelling attributes, presenting grounded characters who and conflicts that it doesn't even spend all that much time fleshing out, until it aggravates you further upon failing to keep consistent even with its ambitious attention to realism. The film stands to go much more over the top with its drama, or at least feels like it does when many of the histrionics go filtered through naturalist storytelling, but make no mistake, histrionics do stand, and are hard to ignore when they break the aforementioned consistencies in realism and shake some of the believability that this film seems to thrive on in so many ways, all for the sake of more flavorful dramatics that don't go as sold as they probably should be by questionable directorial storytelling. Again, what most characterizes this drama is the same thing that characterizes many other very European drama of its type: a naturalist storytelling style, which is effective at times, when not betrayed by the near-distancing familiarity and believability lapses, yet all too often simply bland, discarding musicality and heavily utilizing a sobering atmosphere to try and immerse, only to dull down momentum, which this film cannot afford to lose too much of. Clocking in at just about three hours, this minimalist, either realistic or melodramatic meditative piece is, of course, way too blasted long, and sure, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this film keeps things going throughout its overwhelming length, but, as you can imagine, when filler and material drag, they meander seemingly to no end, bloating a should-be relatively simple script with repetitious excess, made all the more aimless-seeming by the aforementioned lack of momentum to storytelling. Join all of these pacing problems with all of the familiarity and dramatic inconsistencies, and you end up with yet another overblown European art effort, many of which have fallen seriously flat in the past, due to their lacking certain subtle strengths that save this particular effort, yet by no means fulfill full potential. The film ultimately falls as underwhelming, and considering that it asks so much that it's not able to fully prove worthy of, it could have fallen deeper, yet when it's all said and done, decency is maintained in the telling of a story that, to be honest, has more promise than I might lead you to believe.\r\n\r\nDriven by themes of finding yourself as you come of age through a modern, yet thankfully not heavy-handedly presented story of homosexual romance, this film's narrative is intriguing, not simply in its relevance, but in its audacity, conceptually taking a generally realistic approach to compelling subject matter on a minimalist level that limits a potential for juicy scope, but carries a potential for depth whose execution can make or break a film of this type. Abdellatif Kechiche, even as a writer joined by Ghalia Lacroix, carries a lot of pressure on his shoulders when it comes to doing a promising story concept justice, and neither he nor Lacroix can manage all of that weight with the formulaic storytelling, melodramatic bits and, of course, aggressively overdrawn structuring, yet they do what they can with fairly sharp dialogue, in addition to characterization that, despite certain immediate developmental limitations, is rich and tightly handled enough to help in getting you through a hefty runtime, and with only so much flare to its own execution. Minimalist and naturalist, despite a sprawling length, this film does not so much aim to be as stylistically striking as many other European opuses of its nature, but really focuses on storytelling to drive it, and without aesthetic compensation, it runs a tremendous risk of collapsing as misguided and overblown, yet when it's all said and done, the script, while not all that outstanding, is strong enough to play an instrumental role in establishing a certain consistent intrigue that secures the final product shy of mediocrity, yet not without the help of a directorial execution that is perhaps just as inspired, and perhaps just as flawed. Well, perhaps Kechiche's efforts as director aren't so much thoroughly flawed, as much as their thoroughly questionable, intentionally making the classic move of naturalizing its atmosphere, not so much to an ethereal point, but certainly to a chilled point, which dulls momentum down something fierce upon seeing lapses in material that of course, lapses often, and yet, when something actually opens in this minimalist, yet still lengthy drama, Kechiche's naturalism feels genuinely thoughtful, subtly, but surely drawing through all of the dramatic setbacks and drawing in the narrative's core juice with enough realization to compel, even without all of the atmospheric polish of striking visuals and effective score work.There's just enough intrigue to Kechiche's steady storytelling to keep you going, maybe even entertained to some degree or another, and decidedly moved at times, which is good, because outside of that, this film really doesn't have all that much going for it as a minimalist art drama that's even too minimalist to present all that much rich dramatic material, of which there is still enough to be well-handled by the storytellers and, of course, the performers. Perhaps the performances are so much more consistent in their decency than the storytelling because there's so little material for the performers to fumble with, yet if more material was there, I've no doubt that it wouldn't be placed into outstanding performances, at least by leads Adèle Exarchopoulos and Léa Seydoux, who stand out only on occasion, but never lose their electric and layered chemistry while they, as individuals, convince enough to sell much of this character stud's humanity, particularly when emotional range comes into play. Range isn't exactly a key term to frequently use is descriptions of this film, as it is just way too minimalist and, at the same time, overblown for its own good, but in a film where decency is sensitive, subtle strengths go a long way, and while the final product can never be anything more than merely decent, it has enough conviction to endear, if you're willing to take the challenges it presents as a flawed art drama.\r\n\r\nOnce the color has faded, the natural shortcomings of this minimalist draw go too firmly stressed by formulaic, occasionally melodramatic, consistently dry and exhaustingly overdrawn storytelling for decency to be all that firmly secured, but through genuine conceptual intrigue that is done justice by smart writing, directorial highlights and a pair of worthy lead performances by Adèle Exarchopoulos and Léa Seydoux, decency is maintained, making \"Blue is the Warmest Col[u]u[/u]r\" (Europeans, que faites-vous encore?) a fairly intriguing, if overblown study on modern love.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

Where this film excels at is in its portrayal of young love and the first relationship and the first break-up as it truly gets how emotionally exhilarating and heartbreaking those are. Lea Seydoux killed it in such a great role, but what Adele Exarchopoulos did here is nothing short of spectacular. Adele's journey is so powerful, and this extremely talented actress acted out her every scene brilliantly – uncomfortable feelings, sadness, infatuation, confusion, shame, heartbreak, regret and so on and so forth. She did it all, and delivered what is truly the performance of the decade. The film is highly emotional in its third act and thematically rich, but unfortunately Abdellatif Kechiche ruined the film and prevented it from reaching true greatness. He directed it through excessive male gaze which resulted in unnecessarily, uncomfortably long sex scenes and a frustratingly apparent objectification of his stars throughout. The editing and runtime were also in dire need of restraint and discipline.",

In the first 1.5 hour director Abdel Kechiche throws balls to the wall depicting so vividly the intimate moments between two persons in love. I noticed this film had limited release (probably due to its NC-17 rating) and some may find it offensive or uncomfortable to watch due to the explicit intimacy moments which clearly shows not only the chemistry between both stars but their acting was superb! This is a coming of age story, and as one critic pointed out something must be said for a three hour long film that remains consistently engaging. Initially the three hour notice seemed a red flag to me and I really thought it was going to be a bore but I was blown away by the profoundness, honesty, and beauty of this film. Even the nature scenes, the birds singing their lovely melodies, the children in the playground, everything was perfectly executed.  At the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, the film unanimously won the Palme d'Or from the official jury and the FIPRESCI Prize. It is the first film to have the Palme d'Or awarded to both the director and the lead actresses, with Seydoux and Exarchopoulos becoming the only women apart from director Jane Campion to have ever won the award. That speaks volumes about this amazing project written, produced and directed by Kechiche. I agree with ALL the critics lauding this one and ditto to what Tom Clift from Moviedex said: \"\"A tender, at times devastating portrayal of the lifespan of a relationship, one that's as convincing and intimate as any you've ever seen on screen.\" After reading what some of the cast members had to endure while filming this project, I am more in awe and I wish continued success to the cast members!

One of them I know \"tossed his monkey\" during an intense and graphic sex scene then fell asleep for the rest of the film.

But at the same time I can say more bad things about it than good (although make no mistake quality beats quantity here, no matter how hard that may be to believe).\n\nFirstly, there's a huge deviation from the theme's in Julie Maroh's graphic novel, which I'm not usually against (I mean hey the Waschowskis did it well enough in V for Vendetta), but it results in some very key moments being cut (readers of the novel will know what I'm talking about). Speaking of getting cut, I'd like to speak on this films length. It's 3 hours long and doesn't need to be. There are entire scenes, entire conversations that can be cut shorter and you will still get the same  product. There's simply too much filler to give me enough of a reason to gleefully sit through a film of this length with NO INTERMISSION. Which would've been nice in the middle (especially given this film's French title denoting chapters).\n\nSpeaking of the middle, the sex scenes. Oh, the sex scenes. I'm usually one to defend scenes like this and to be fair, they're not without their justification, insofar as they are a very explicit metaphor for the couple's passion between each other. But here's the thing. The criticism says they're shot like porn. But I can't even call them porn. Pornography has a serious obsession with the anatomy of the act, and it's intensity. It makes sex look like a dirty sport more than anything else. And yeah these scenes do look like Skinemax at 3 in the morning, but at the same time, the leads (not to insult them, as they are two very beautiful women) aren't exactly Playboy bunnies. It's too real to be called porn and too explicit to be called anything else.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's still a beautiful film. The acting put me on the edge of tears, the soundtrack (consisting of reggae and what I assume is EDM, although I'm not familiar enough with electronic music to be sure) is impeccable and despite some eurocentricity it's very moving and conveys the action very accurately, and the subtle aesthetic choices of the director really bring this thing together. It's a film that to me is ever so close to being great.",

This is a great film that is honest about relationships and how they are portrayed.  The film is well acted and by that, i mean that this couple really takes over the screen.  Léa Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos really deserve Oscar nominations for this and they probably would have gotten them if it weren't for this film's controversial lesbian sex scenes.  These scenes work well with the film's raw style of filmmaking, but then they tend keep going on and on which becomes distracting. One of these scenes in particular went on for nearly 10 minutes and it was the only time in the movie that I was checking my watch. This and the run time are the only knit picks I have with the movie.

The story spans the journey of a young 17 year old girl (Adele) as she falls in love with a slightly older woman, their deeply committed relationship, and the agony of the loss of that relationship. It's a deep and powerful coming of age narrative that had me riveted for the three hours of its running time.\n\nThe movie has quite a bit of controversy surrounding it. Firstly, the sex scenes are very explicit and high impact with some questioning whether it needed to go as far as it did. Secondly, the conditions under which the actors were required to work because of the director's approach and demands have raised questions about whether the two young actors were exploited. And, finally, some of the gay community have criticised the film because the actors were not homosexual, suggesting that the movie is little more than a heterosexual's biased vision of what they would like a lesbian relationship to be like.\n\nI saw the movie without knowing about any of these criticisms. In my opinion it's an extraordinary film. The acting, particularly by Adele Exarchopoulos, is incredible. It is a deeply moving exploration, as Robbie Collin puts it, of \"pleasure, sadness, anger, lust and hope.\" A truly remarkable achievement.",

I love the genuine emotions the actresses portray, how natural they were, I could not imagine how hard it must've been to shoot for 5 months, no make-up, no stylist just true, natural emotions. I was amazed considering the fact that most of the time the camera was focused on their face. I was captivated by the story and how believable Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux's chemistry worked! Also, I am a new fan of French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche, the first work of him that I saw was 'Black Venus' (Venus Noir), kudos to him and his amazing actresses, just wow!

It felt totally real and without any pretense - just a frank portrayal of Adèle's life, with the most realistic-feeling acting performances I've ever seen.  Apparently the realism came from director Abdellatif Kechiche's brutal directing style, according to this now-infamous Daily Beast interview: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/01/the-stars-of-blue-is-the-warmest-color-on-the-riveting-lesbian-love-sory-and-graphic-sex-scenes.html\n\nWhen I was watching this movie, I felt totally immersed in Adèle's life. (The original French title, La Vie d'Adèle - Chapitres 1 & 2, translates to \"The Life of Adèle - Chapters 1 & 2\", which is a more accurate, if less creative, title.) It was like I, as an audience member, was going through all the motions and experiences Adèle was going through as she navigated her coming of age.  During the bar scene (one of the best scenes in the movie), I felt Adèle's apprehension when she saw Emma sitting across the room, and then her nervous excitement as she spoke with her for the first time.  During the scene with the first kiss, I could feel the palpable tension and excitement, and I could read the invisible gears churning in Adèle's head as she contemplated kissing Emma.  During the sex scenes, I felt like I was the one there getting my brains fucked out (more on that later, since it's such a fun subject to talk about).  During the breakup scene, I felt like I was the one heartbroken, on the floor crying, and feeling like my life was over.\n\nThis love story's beauty comes from it being precisely the opposite of the typical sappy and cliché-driven love story.  It's honest, realistic, at parts joyous and brutal, and, in the end, tragic.  Many of the classic tragic love stories derive their tragedies from the deaths of one or both partners, but to me breakups are worse than deaths, because with death there's a clean finality, but with breakups both partners are still there and linger, so depressingly bittersweet and tantalizingly out of reach, as we see in Adèle's post-Emma life and her awkward relationship with Emma after their time together comes to an end.\n\nAs for the same-sex nature of Adèle and Emma's relationship, that element is largely downplayed (aside from a defensive scuffle Adèle gets in with her high school friends and her hiding her relationship from her parents).  The movie wisely avoided any real political or cultural statements about homosexuality, and focused instead on the romance and emotions, and that approach paid off by making the story feel amazingly universal.  To me, this movie didn't even feel like a \"gay movie\", just a love story that happened to be about two women.\n\nYeah, it's long, and I could tell that it was almost three hours long while watching it, but for most of the movie, it's not exactly slow; it's just thorough.  It really covers Adèle's life from the middle of high school to a number of years (5? 6?) later, and it takes time to build up and fully flesh out her character.  And I appreciate the sort of craftsmanship that went into developing her character, as well as Adèle Exarchopoulos's performance that brought that character to life (I really think she should have at least gotten an Academy Award Best Actress nomination).\n\nThe movie did feel like it was losing momentum around the three-quarters mark, when Emma shed her blue hair coloring - and her warmth and affectionate charm along with it, apparently.  The movie also dragged on anticlimactically after the breakup.\n\nI do agree with other critics that the movie left a lot of loose ends hanging with respect to the other people in Adèle's and Emma's lives.  We never see what happened with Emma's previous girlfriend, Sabine, and we don't find out when precisely Emma and Sabine's relationship ended, which is actually somewhat important in light of Adèle's later infidelity.\n\nI didn't really like how almost every scene was a close-up of a character's face.  I understand that the director was trying to put the audience in Adèle's world by basically shoving us right up into her face, but I personally like being able to see more of what's going on.  It works for some parts of the movie, especially the more emotionally intense scenes, but for other parts it would've been nice to at least have the character's entire head in the shot.\n\nThe first, longest, and most infamous sex scene between Adèle and Emma was well-done; it was impulsive, raw and emotional.  I did think it was too abrupt, as the movie jumps from their first kiss right to the sex, but maybe that was the point, that their built-up passion was being torrentially unleashed.  The subsequent sex scenes were weird because they always abruptly followed interesting discussions about Adèle's career.  One minute Adèle would be talking about how she was going to be a teacher, and then before I knew it she was having passionate sex with Emma, and I would be thinking, \"wait!  I want to keep hearing about your career plans...\"\n\nIn terms of acting, Adèle Exarchopoulos's and Léa Seydoux's performances were so powerful that they've completely changed my conception of the limits of acting and how indistinguishably realistic a performance can be.  I'm not even sure if I can go back to watching other people's performances now, because the acting in this film was the most realistic and authentic I've ever seen, and everything else will now seem like dramatic fluff in comparison.  These performances were such that I could barely tell they were actually acting; it was almost like I was watching a documentary or a reality show - the most authentic-to-life reality show ever.\n\nI don't think I ever connected to an on-screen couple the way I did with Adèle and Emma.  You know how fans will often become stupidly attached to fictional couples - write fanfiction stories about them, post fan videos of them on YouTube, etc.?  I always thought that was lame, until I saw Blue is the Warmest Color.  I don't think I'm a bonafide \"fan\" of Adèle and Emma, but if there was ever a cinematic couple I met, became attached to, grew alongside, and rooted for, it was them.\n\nMuch like Spring Breakers, another 2013 movie I really liked, this movie stays with you.  It was on my mind for days afterward.  My life actually feels richer for having seen and experienced this, in no small part because I can personally relate to most of it, especially the rise and fall of a long-term relationship.  But this movie has more to offer beyond its love story centerpiece; it details every aspect of a young woman's professional and personal lives, and infuses her story with the full range of universal human emotions - curiosity, anxiety, excitement, disappointment, joy, sadness, passion, heartbreak, acceptance.  Blue is the Warmest Color might be the most honest and true-to-life on-screen portrayal of not just love, but of human life.",

French-Tunisian director Abdellatif Kechiche's intimate dissection of a romance between two young women is no exception. His film won the Palme d'Or, the top award at the Cannes Film Festival. This was the first time a director and two actresses collectively received the award-by a panel led by such film industry luminaries as Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and director Ang Lee. \n\nThe film features a smashing performance by Adèle Exarchopoulos who has the same first name as the film's protagonist. When we first meet Adèle, she's a high school student confused about her sexual identity. She sees a young blue haired woman on the streets and has dreams about her. Prodded by her gossipy classmates, she has a brief, unsatisfactory relationship with a boy, but soon breaks up with him after an encounter with a female classmate, who kisses her in the school bathroom. The female classmate tells her that she wasn't serious about the encounter but Adèle is taken to a gay bar by a male gay friend but she soon wanders off to a lesbian bar, where she meets the blue-haired woman she had seen out on the streets earlier.\n\nThe young blue-haired woman is Emma (played by an equally intense Léa Seydoux), an older art graduate student. They begin a steamy affair, culminating in a series of explicit sex scenes which has garnered quite a bit of publicity for the film. The second Act occurs after a passage of time-now Emma is trying to break into the art world as a professional artist and Adèle has begun a job as a kindergarten teacher. Director Kechiche pulls out all the stops in depicting the burgeoning romance between the two women. \n\nThe problem with much of it is that it's just too drawn out. That not only includes the sex scenes but other scenes such as when the each women meets one another's parents (Emma's upper middle class parents know that she's gay and are immediately accepting of Adèle; but Adèle's lower middle-class parents are left in the dark as to the nature of their relationship). Mr. Kechiche can't resist closeups of each character discussing how much they enjoy the pasta they're eating. Another earlier scene, where Emma and Adèle engage in a long intellectual discussion about Sartre and other sundry topics on a park bench, also seems to go on and on.\n\nBut I was grudgingly willing to put up with the incredibly drawn out spectacle to see what the final outcome of the relationship was between the two lovers. Before the final blowup, cracks in the facade of the relationship, begin to emerge. Adèle, working much more simply with children, begins to feel out of place in Emma's more sophisticated world of art professionals. Finally, with Emma spending more time in the art world, Adèle has a brief fling with a guy, an actor in American action movies. Emma finally figures out that Adèle has been cheating on her and she flips out. She throws Adèle out of her house and tells she never wants to see her again. I like how Emma was depicted in the scene where she dumps Adèle, as her lack of flexibility and unwillingness to forgive the vulnerable Adèle, showed her to be cold and overly controlling. In other words, there's a multi-dimensionality to the character.\n\nThe rest of the film I would say is anti-climactic. Some years pass and Adèle spends a good deal of time by herself, trying to get over her relationship with Emma, but not quite doing so. She finally meets with Emma after quite a bit of time has gone by, who ostensibly has forgiven her. Adèle attempts to force herself on Emma in a restaurant but Emma is now committed to another woman and rejects her. Flash forward again- Emma invites Adèle to her art exhibition, where Adèle finally accepts the fact that Emma has moved on. Her run in with the actor (who's now a real estate agent) doesn't seem to go anywhere.\n\n'Blue' is a three hour movie but it probably could have been more effective with 45 minutes of less footage. I wonder if the sex scenes were pared down, the film would have garnered as much publicity as it did. The end of filming was not the end to the controversy. Not only did union members complain about director Kechiche over working them but Exarchopoulos and Seydoux indicated that they never wanted to work with Kechiche again as they indicated that he treated them roughly while shooting the film.. Seydoux went as far as saying that she felt like a \"prostitute\" during the film shoot. Kechiche was offended by his actors' comments and at one point was quoted as saying that he hoped the film would not be released. There was also talk that Kechiche was going to sue Seydoux for her comments.\n\nProbably both parties overreacted. Exarchopoulos and Seydoux knew what kind of film they were getting into, when they signed the contract to act in it and they probably should have known Kechiche was a perfectionist. On the other hand, Kechiche perhaps should have taken into account his actors' youth and directed them a little more gently.\n\nAll in all, 'Blue is the warmest color', is a well-made film which captures the intensity of the intense relationship between two young women, who ultimately were not right for each other. The film needed to flow better and the editing was just not there. If you're willing to put up with the film's overall length, you will still be rewarded with some phenomenal acting and intense dissection of a relationship that ran its course.",

The cinematography is beautiful, the script good and the score is nice.

            "content": "I never thought in my wildest dreams that this movie would get so graphic. Adèle is in high school, studying literature. After a day of studying a portion of a French novel dealing with love and women and having love pass you by in an instant, Adèle passes a couple on the street. One of the pair is a woman with blue hair. The moment strikes Adèle immediately. They exchange glances, but she cannot get that blue haired woman out of her thoughts. Adèle's exploration into her sexuality and who she is begins that night, when she's taken aback by her dream of that woman. Thoughts start reeling in Adèle's mind about who she is. She takes chances with a classmate, trying to steal a kiss in the bathroom, only to have it backfire on her. Adèle is lost accompanying one of her friends out to a male gay bar, she follows a group of girls to a lesbian bar. Searching and searching for this woman who will not leave her mind, Adèle spots her. Her name is Emma, and she is in college for painting. A friendship eventually develops that becomes so much more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are so many coming of age films out there, but Blue Is The Warmest Color has to be one of the only relatively mainstream ones about a girl finding love in a lesbian relationship. The film is really honest and raw. When Emma shows up at Adèle's school and they walk away together, it stirs up some hate towards Adèle for hanging out with a quote on quote \"dyke\" and the name calling and threats begin. Adèle being who she is, it rolls off her back, and does not deter her from falling in love, Adèle is enraptured with Emma, almost to the point of obsession. She lives and breathes Emma with an unhealthy dependence on attention from her. It almost becomes dangerous. Jealousy fuels the fire, leading to some unwise and childish behaviors from Adèle. The film has a run time of three hours, but it certainly did not feel like it. While every scene is not necessary for the main story line, each fleshes out the character of Adèle fully. We know her insecurities, her dislikes, her dreams, and her goals. Both Léa Seydoux and Adèle are phenomenal. She is mesmerizing, her eyes, her lips, and especially her hair captivated me personally. It takes a lot as an actress to give everything you have to a character, and I believe that both actresses did just that. It is on their faces and they wear they hearts on their sleeves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay no review of this film would be complete without mentioning the sex scenes. Blue Is The Warmest Color is rated NC-17 for a reason. These are graphic, long sex scenes, especially the first one. They leave nothing to the imagination, the actresses go for it entirely. I read that they used prosthetic genitalia, and if so, those are really good prostheses. I would recommend not seeing this with your parents or with a conservative friend. I guarantee you that there were a couple of walk outs in the theater. Those scenes are very long (like ten or fifteen minutes long), and I wonder what the motive was???. It certainly does not make the viewers think the characters are more in love. Abdellatif Kechiche may have wanted to push the boundaries o the maximum limit, but it was unnecessary even though I really didn't mind. Even if this were a straight couple having graphic sex for a long period of time, I would still question the director's motives. Aside from the sex scenes, Blue Is The Warmest Color is a complete love story with a beginning, middle, and end. It is also about self-discovery, growing up, and regret. It is a creative take on the love story that takes risks and aims to be a topic of conversation after you have viewed the film.",

            "content": "Una storia d'amore. Che nasce per uno sguardo casuale in una piazza affollata, esplode di inarrestabile passione, poi inizia a raffreddarsi tra routine e piccoli malintesi, infine si conclude con amarezza a causa di nuove attrazioni anche se il legame fatica a spezzarsi. Adele è una liceale di Lilla che vive le incertezze proprie della sua età, tra una famiglia che non ne intuisce il difficile momento e una scuola di periferia animata però da insegnanti appassionati che ne alimentano l'amore per la letteratura. La sua omosessualità si disvela incrociando Emma, più vecchia di lei di qualche anno, proprio mentre sta andando all'appuntamento con un ragazzo: quando la ritrova in un bar per lesbiche dove è finita un po' per caso e un po' no,. ci vuole poco perché il rapporto diventi intensamente fisico e, per lungo tempo, si trasformi in una simbiosi allo stesso tempo totalizzante e liberatoria. Quando però Adele cresce e corona il suo sogno di insegnare all'asilo - inizia qui la seconda parte del film - si presentano nuove opportunità che finiranno per allontanare le due ragazze: i capelli di Emma - non più studentessa d'arte, ma pittrice - non sono più blu come nella prima parte e sono il simbolo della normalizzazione. Malgrado una scenataccia di gelosia che soffoca nella culla il rapporto dell'amante con un collega, è proprio Emma a rifarsi presto una vita con una nuova compagna, mentre Adele - più fragile - resta a fare i conti con il vuoto nella sua vita e una brace che non si vuole spegnere. L'idea che ci vogliano tre ore per raccontare una storia all'apparenza banale potrebbe spaventare, eppure - a parte una scena di sesso da circa otto minuti francamente pletorica (però, nel caso scappasse la pipì...) - il franco tunisino Kechiche gira un film in cui non si avverte il passare del tempo grazie a una capacità di raccontare con levità che rende estremamente scorrevole il passare dei minuti. Il tran-tran della vita quotidiana - la scuola, la famiglia, il lavoro - è reso interessante da un notevole cura per il particolare e, soprattutto, grazie a un'attenzione assidua per i volti e gli sguardi, con una speciale predilezione per quelli di Adèle Exarchopoulos, indagata da mille primi piani quando è sveglia e anche quando è addormentata con l'utilizzo di materiale girato fuori scena per accentuare l'autenticità. Il soggetto è tratto da un fumetto di Julie March, ma il regista e lo co-sceneggiatrice Ghalia Lacroix ne hanno eliminato qualsiasi effetto melodrammatico per raccontare una vicenda che dimostra che, se ogni amore è diverso a modo suo, tutti possono essere interessanti da raccontare (ma bisogna esserne capaci, ovviamente, come nelle delicatissime scene al parco quando il sentimento si dischiude) e non importa se il sesso dei due componenti la coppia sia uguale o diverso. Curiosamente, la questione che ha smosso la chiacchiera attorno al film viene ben presto accantonata durante la visione perché l'attenzione è attratta da aspetti più intriganti, dimostrando che spesso lo scandalo è nella mente di chi guarda: Kechiche sta dalla parte dei suoi personaggi e si limita a mostrare le reazioni delle persone attorno alle due ragazze limitandosi a indicare i due estremi del rifiuto un po' ipocrita da parte delle compagne di scuola e della serena accettazione nella famiglia di Emma. Ne esce un film che unisce qualità narrativa e grande densità emotiva sprigionando un fascino sottile che si infila sottopelle e cresce con il passare del tempo dopo che i titoli di coda sono finiti: non è perfetto - c'è qualche lungaggine, le scene di sesso sono troppe e allentano la tensione, il rapporto di Adele con i genitori è inconsistente, il salto all'età adulta troppo brusco - ma si tratta di difetti ben lontani dall'inficiare la qualità complessiva che è stata con merito premiata a Cannes. Così come è giusto che sia stata riconosciuta la bravura delle due attrici che sono sempre al centro della scena - il resto del cast fa tappezzeria - protagoniste di un impegnativo tour de force da cui escono come meglio non si potrebbe disegnando due figure molto concrete, magari non particolarmente simpatiche ma estremamente reali ('niente trucco sul set!' pare abbia ordinato il burbero regista e la povera Léa Seydoux è stata costretta a studiare Brando e Dean per tirar fuori la propria parte maschile).",

So I pirated it from a wonderful website called PornHub.com. I was unimpressed. Unlike one of my favorite genre films, Back Door Butt Fuck Sluts Gone Nuts Vol. XXVII, it did not deliver on the \"all anal action,\" \"freaky lesbians playing with their toys,\" and \"hours of eleven-inch strap-on pelvic thrusts,\" like it was advertised to have. In fact, very little of this film featured the \"erotic girl-on-girl action\" that my colleagues stated it did.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do like my porn to have a story to it, this porno takes far too long to get around to the actual sex. And when it does, the performers are clearly amateurs. I mean, they don't even use a real vagina! It's a prosthetic! Do I look stupid? I have been watching and reviewing films of this genre ever since I hit puberty, so don't act like I can't tell the difference between a rubber vagina and a real one. Ridiculous. These girls need to get down and dirty if they expect me to pay attention.\r\n\r\nThis film is fine overall, but pales in comparison to such classics of the genre as Dyke Hard, When Harry Ate Sally, and Call of Booty: Modern Whorefare. Unlike those masterpieces, this film contains very little graphic strap-on penetration, scissoring, fisting, and hardcore sex of any kind. What a disappointment. Also, what kind of a name is \"Blue is the Warmest Color?\" It should have had a far more inventive title than that. Saturday Night Beaver? Cumming to America? The Lord of the Anal Beads? You guys seriously passed all of these up?\r\n\r\nOverall, I give Blue is the Warmest Color 4 out of 10 stars. It's not that bad once you get past how tame it all is, but there's still far too much talking and nearly none of the hardcore sex that films of this genre should have. Prudish movies like this might have been okay for the 1950s, but nowadays, we should expect more.",

Whether you are for or against same-sex relationships, you will truly feel for these characters as they go through many changes. The arcs of these characters is absolutely phenomenal and it really makes you feel bad for anyone who is afraid to come out about their sexuality. This film is brilliantly written, directing, and photographed. There is not one issue I had with this film, inside and out. \"Blue is the Warmest Colour\" is my favourite film of 2013. No second thoughts were put into that decision, because this really gave me many things to think about, and I did not feel like I was watching a movie a times.",

            "content": "Blue is the Warmest Color is one of the most honest relationship movies I have come across in a long time.  Abdel Kechiche gives us a bare to the bone look (literally) of Emma and Adele over three hours of footage.  There's no surprise it already won top prize at Cannes, but aside from the accolades, Blue allows us to feel with the characters through the superb acting of newcomer Exarchopoulos and seasoned unheralded vet Seydoux.  \n\nCertainly, Kechiche takes questionable material with gay/lesbian relationships that are so infrequent in cinema and puts it on the front burner.  However, I'd argue the real story lies in a young girl's uncertainty with herself sexually and emotionally more so than being a label.  \n\nA few minor ticks...the movie was split into two apparent chapters.  The second was significantly better than the first and carried more of the weight emotionally of the film than the first.  The acting was more apparent and demanding in the second chapter, also.  Sexuality was a big part of this story, but a few of the scenes dragged a bit.  There could have been quicker edits with the same material to give more explosion to the feeling of the scene.  No doubt both women are beauties of our time.  \n\nI was also a little unsure of how much time had passed as the story progressed.  There weren't enough easily noticeable cues to help guide me on the timeline of when the story aged from Adele being 15 to 18 to however old she is toward the end.\n\nThis is not a romantic comedy.  It is not a comedy in the slightest.  It's a vivid rolling image of a young girl's life.  A love story.  Exarchopoulos shows incredible promise by warping the emotions of the audience through a simple facial expression or word.  I took a class in college that talked about how relationships move along a path and how most movies get the true sequence wrong.  What Kechiche and these women are able to do is make real life resemble this art of a film.  It won't be for most movie-goers.  In fact, a small fragment of my age group would even be tempted to watch this French subtitled film, but if you have any opportunity to immerse yourself in a flick about realistic propositions, take the time to see this one.",

            "content": "This could be summed up as a light porno with a beautiful story of love, forgiveness, and strength.\n\nThis film is a French coming of age film about a young girl, Adele, in her late teens who meets another girl, Emma, who defines the phrase \"love at first sight\" to her.\n\nThey first made an innocent glance at each other and later met and talked at a lesbian bar.\n\nEmma has blue hair, she is an artist, but she is not the main character of this film, Adele is.\n\nAdele is an aspiring teacher who meets Emma and after they meet and hang out at multiple times, they eventually become insuperable and decide to live together. They make love constantly (I will talk about this more later in the review).\n\nLater in the film, as Emma is getting more involved with her passion for painting and drawing, Adele begins to feel alone and she makes the huge mistake she eventually regrets later of sleeping with another person, this making Emma crazy mad. Emma kicks Adele out of the house and forces her out of her life.\n\nAdele is heartbroken and feels saddened by the whole situation as well as her mistake. Even though she lives with the guilt and cannot stop crying, she continues to work hard at job as a teacher.\n\nThree years pass and Emma agrees to meet with Adele at a restaurant. They talk, share how their lives are going, and they even tread delicate territory; enough to make them pounce on each other, making out. But they stop themselves and with Emma having a family at last, she insists that there could never be anything between them again. But Emma does admit that she will always feel tenderness towards Adele.\n\nThis film is a simple beauty, full of great acting, real looking sex scenes, and beautiful imagery.\n\nAdele Exarchopoulos does an amazing job with her character of Adele. I can tell that she truly taps into the emotion that Adele feels. She also has a very pretty face.\n\nThe sex scenes are something else, not to gross you out. I believe there are about three or four sex scenes between Emma and Adele and they get so close to each other that they might as well be having sex. I never actually saw one girls tongue or lips on or near another girl's vagina in the film, but they might as well have been there. For example, Emma's face was deep into Adele's crotch and I couldn't even see anything but her hair. It was intense as well.\n\nFor the imagery, one scene stood out the most.\n\nWhen Emma was hosting a gathering dinner for her art, there was a dancing scene. Adele was dancing with a guy while Emma was smiling and talking with another girl, which Adele could clearly see. At the same time, an old black and white movie was playing on a big screen at the back of the party behind Adele.\n\nAs Adele could see Emma having a good time with the other girl, the audience could see Adele's jealous yet saddened face. At the same time, the camera would focus first on Adele's face, then switch the focus to the movie being played in the background, bringing focus to the movie's female character and her saddened face. The camera would switch the focus back and forth between Adele and the woman in the movie and her multiple emotion-filled faces that matched Adele's emotions at times while looking at Emma.\n\nThis film is gorgeous and a great love story for today's growing acceptance of gay people.\n\nBlue is the Warmest Color, I give you a 100%.",

For Adele in particular, the movie demands a lot from her role. It explores the sexual identity confusion at the beginning, to the moment when true love appears, the joys and challenges to maintain that relationship, and what comes after that. Adele manages to nail every scene by bringing out a whole spectrum of emotions.\n\nWhether it is a lesbian story or not, in the realm of movies dealing with romance I can easily rank this one as high as the likes of 500 Days of Summer, for the level of depth and honesty. It is definitely far more genuine than the pretentious \"The Kids are All Right\". La vie d'Adèle's strength is in the raw emotions so it does not need to rely on philosophical/ intelligent points which may work in some other movies of the same genre, even though the director did raise some food-for-thought, verbally, in certain scenes that were not-so-obvious. The only thing that drags this movie below perfection is I feel there is still a lack of involvement from the side characters (parents, friends circle, ex-lovers) given that it is a 3-hour movie. There is some, but not enough. In a coming-of-age story, influence form the people around the main characters could be important factors to how relationship changes.\n\nAs the Palm d'Or winner, I would be happy if it to win the foreign Oscar, but this failed to top Le Passe (A follow-up of the brilliant A Separation) in my view",

And although other films this year, such as The Wolf of Wall Street and 12 Years a Slave have caused some because of their graphic depictions of sex, drug use, slavery, and violence, they represent the smallest fraction of visual insanity that is featured in Blue is the Warmest Color. I have been watching movies semi-professionally for three years now, and over the course of this time I've watched over 700 films. But I can safely say that I've never seen anything quite like this one. Do not let the reviewers fool you-- They aren't prudes, there really is a FUCKLOAD of sex in this movie. But I'm going to try and judge it purely based on its dialogue, use of metaphors, acting, story, and camerawork... and try to ignore the fact that PEOPLE HAVE SEX EVERY FIVE MINUTES-- Okay. I'm calm. I will be as straightforward as I can with this, and attempt not to go totally off the rails over the insanity of what I just saw.\r\n\r\nBlue is the Warmest Color is adapted from a graphic (AND I MEAN GRAPHIC) novel of the same name. This film is French, and given its subject matter, I am already inclined to give it a higher score. France, as you may know, has had some trouble recently regarding gay rights. There have been protests in the street by homophobes who get all butthurt (or as the French say, \"la douleur de la crosse\") over laws allowing gays and lesbians the same rights as straight couples. So this is definitely an important film to see, especially if you are a bigoted fuckhead with the mental capacity of an overripe turnip. Sadly, I doubt that the film will make a big impact on the bigoted fuckheads here in the United States (after all, it's got subtitles, and it's not like bigots can read very well), but it's still an important step forward for France.\r\n\r\nThe film stars Adèle Exarchopoulos as a young girl who, after a chance meeting, falls madly in love with an older lesbian named Emma (Léa Seydoux) with blue hair. It's never quite clear if Emma makes her realize that she's been a lesbian all along, or if she was so charismatic that she made her \"switch teams,\" so to speak. But either way, she leaves quite an impression on both Adèle and the audience. The dialogue between the two feels real to the point where you forget that you are actually watching a movie, which is a very rare thing in ANY kind of movie these days, especially romances. I didn't stop believing what was happening for a second, although during the SEX SCENES, I started to wonder just what it was like to film this thing. According to the two leads, the director of this movie had horrible on-set manners, which probably made these difficult scenes ever harder to film. But even so, it's hard to tell this from the movie, as everything runs very smoothly throughout it.\r\n\r\nBITWC is definitely going to go down in history (unfortunately) as That One NC-17 Lesbian Movie With All the Sex. But it honestly disgusts me that this movie got such a rating. Sure, there is a lot of graphic nudity in this film, but it's not like it was vapid and pointless like the sex in some movies. These two characters were actually in love, so what kind of world do we live in where the natural act of physical love is frowned upon like this, while utterly idiotic movies that are jam-packed with blood and gore squeeze by with a PG-13 rating? God, it sickens me to the core. Yes, this movie was an all-out assault on good taste, and yes, I couldn't lift my jaw back up to my mouth for a good half-hour after seeing it, but nothing in this is going to leave some kind of lasting impression on me that will scar me for life. The ratings system is a form of censorship, and although it's definitely more agreeable than the Motion Picture Production Code, it's still a higher power telling us what we can and can't see. There are no actual written laws about what you can put in a movie today, but movie theaters still turn teenagers away from R-rated film, and many theaters still refuse to play NC-17 films. I hate to give so much attention to the controversy of this film, because it certainly has other merits, but I respect it immensely for not cowtowing to \"good taste\" and right-wing Christian values crap like that. This is an important film to see.\r\n\r\nAlthough there's a lot of people doin' the nasty in this movie (perhaps too much), it should not be categorized this way. No, male reviewers don't only like it for this reason-- It is powerfully acted and visually arresting. The undertones of true love and soul mates are present throughout, and there is a lot of symbolism throughout, ranging from the obvious (when the main characters eat oysters... yeesh) to the more obscure (when Adèle swims in the sea, which of course is blue). Looking for these metaphors can take time, but you don't really have to, because the dialogue is just as strong as the visual grandeur of the film. Even the small talk between the characters is absolutely spellbinding. You just don't get great drama like this very much nowadays, and even though it was ridiculously ambitious, it had my attention from beginning to end. Not many three-hour movies have had me totally riveted from the get-go-- In fact, I can think of only two others, Lawrence of Arabia and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly-- But this had perfect pacing and likable characters, leading to one of the most enjoyable movie experiences of the year. \r\n\r\nFinal Score for Blue is the Warmest Color: 8/10 stars. My problems with this movie are few, but when they are present, they are pretty significant. Although the sex definitely had a \"wow\" factor, it honestly did not need to happen so often. Not being a prude, just saying... repetitious grunting and moaning does not further the plot or provide character development. As it is with any film, I fully support scenes of nudity the same way I support scenes of spontaneous decapitation. But if you're going to put a lot of it in your movie, you should have some reasoning behind it to back it up. And even if there's a lot of it in this, the reasoning is sound. This film is about love and loss, and what people are willing to go through in the name of true love. The main character is likable, the dialogue is fantastic, and the cinematography is utterly spectacular. Minor flaws aside, this is one of the best films of 2013. But would it have killed them to use the song \"Crystal Blue Persuasion\" in it? Damn... missed opportunity.",

This is one of the saddest, yet sweetest love stories ever told, and I cannot remember the last time two actors reverberated such an intensely realistic passion for one another.  Everything is believable, and I'm stretched to comprehend how in the hell the actors did it.  This film is a testimony to the real magic of performance, the subtle illusions an actor can create for his/her audience.  As beautifully shot as it is, the actors carry this film the entire three hours.  The on-screen chemistry between Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux is elegantly realized and realistically rendered; I couldn't help but sympathize with them both. I wanted to reach out and hug Adele, adopt her as a daughter and take care of her.  Sounds weird, but my heart just went out to this character.  At times the movie is extremely sexual, but these scenes never quite feel gratuitous, but instead serve to illuminate the film's particular ethos: that every moment is a microcosm of meaning and beauty, and while love may not last forever, it's still worth pursuing.",

But it's graphic enough that I'm glad I saw it in the comfort of my bedroom instead of a movie theater filled with people. Those scenes aside, the controversy and a brouhaha surrounding it often makes people overlook the fact that this is a wonderful, beautiful bittersweet story about young love/first love. It's simple enough: A teenage girl's sexuality is awakened as she falls for an older woman. The audience is taken to the journey of their relationship.

It is the first film to have the Palme d'Or awarded to both the director and the lead actresses, with Léa Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos becoming the only women apart from director Jane Campion to have ever won the award. Some better informed critics were suspecting that this award is just a result of politically organized campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in France regardless the January and March 2013 massive protests against that move which made news worldwide. On May 26, with thousands of people calling for the withdrawal of the now approved law, this movie won the Palme d'Or at the 66th Cannes Festival. I stopped believing in coincidences long time ago!\r\n\r\nThe story of Adèle (Adèle Exarchopoulos), a high-school student whose female friends  encourage to go out with a boy who is attracted to her, but soon finds out that one day instantly falls in love with a passing-by woman with blue hair (Léa Seydoux), was different. Especially because of the very long and dragging sex-scenes which were like from a lesbian soft porn movie manual (if there was such a thing). I cannot say that the director Abdellatif Kechiche didn't do it tastefully as much as possible, but it was still what it is - soft porn! The artistic value of the movie was not positively affected by these scenes at all. Maybe there were there to shock, but they could do that only with the tenth of the length. The underdeveloped characters gave us some interesting situations where we have a young lady who reads a lot but doesn't know what Fine Arts are... or who was Gustav Klimt! I don't want to even mention the bad table manners... The soap opera \"tricks of the trade\" were very well hidden behind the \"shocks of the trade\", and that shows that Abdellatif Kechiche knew what was he doing and managed to fool most of the fans! I am not saying that I am the \"smart one\", but I could not forget the feeling that I am becoming like my mom if I start watching this and enjoying it. But I have to mention that Adèle Exarchopoulos as Adèle was worth watching - I didn't care at the end if it's a soap opera or serious drama - she was outstanding young actress which was so believable that you could get the feel that could be a simple documentary. Exarchopoulos described how her auditions with Kechiche over the course of two months consisted improvisation of scenarios, discussions and also of them both sitting in a cafe, without talking, while he quietly observed her. It was later, a day before the New Year, that Kechiche decided to offer Exarchopoulos the leading role in the film, as he said in an interview, \"I chose Adèle the minute I saw her. I had taken her for lunch at a brasserie. She ordered lemon tart and when I saw the way she ate it I thought, \"It's her!\"\" The two main actresses, Léa Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos, didn't think so highly of the director - they both complained about Kechiche's behaviour during the shooting. They described the experience as \"horrible\", and said they would not work with him again.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see some outstanding acting - this should be a good choice... for everything else, your standard daily TV soap opera or \"pornhub\" will do.",

            "content": "On January and March 2013, massive protests against same-sex marriage took the streets of Paris and made news worldwide. On May 18, same-sex marriage was legalized in France, what lead to another big manifestation, on May 26, with thousands of people calling for the withdrawal of the approved law. On that same day, a lesbian film won the Palme d'Or at the 66th Cannes Festival.\n\nThere's no doubt that Blue is the warmest color (La Vie d'Adèle - Chapitres 1 et 2) was controversial even before its première. If at that time I already thought that the Palme d'Or was a political choice - Cannes Jury President Steven Spielberg denies it, of course - after watching Abdellatif Kechiche's film, no doubts are left. The award was followed and celebrated mainly on social networks, with the film being praised by thousands of people who came to watch it only months later. Groupthink, something common within the public, has become also a constant feature within the critic, pretty much unanimous in their praise. It's known that film festivals are not parameter of quality anymore, but it's still expected that a film will be acclaimed for something else besides ideological and political views and long shots of graphic sex and nudity, which, by the way, reminds me of Shame, although Steve McQueen's film has a more interesting background. We must also mention Stranger by the Lake - winner of Cannes 2013's Queer Palm Award and Un Certain Regard (Best Director)-, a film really worthy of polemics, however, innovative and thought-provoking.\n\nBased on Julie Maroh's comic book Le Bleu Est Une Couleur Chaud (Blue is a warm color), that covers the (around) fourteen years since Clémentine (Adèle) and Emma meet until the melodramatic final shot, Blue is the warmest color is more like a cheap soap opera praised as masterpiece. While Maroh's comic book focus on coming out, prejudice, doubts and fears, Kechiche insists that he had nothing militant to say about it and was only telling the story of a couple. Maroh actually echoes him saying that none of them had a militantly activist intent, but if you make a book hoping to no longer be insulted, rejected, beaten up, raped and murdered for being gay, you do have a militantly activist intent. Perhaps that was not the film's aim, however, if an absurd but turning point scene from the book was not included, Adèle's friends' homophobic reaction, the gay pride scene and the \"lesbian sex for Dummies\" could've also been removed. If such scenes were kept is because homosexuality, albeit quite in vogue, is obviously still not widely accepted, with no place, therefore, to the simplistic speech of \"a couple like any other.\" Or maybe, and I bet all my chips there, given the media coverage received by the film, it's just one more \"lesbian chic product\", because if homosexuality is portrayed in a natural way somehow, the sex scenes are so laughable that one is sure Kechiche made his homework: lots and lots of lesbian porn and corny romance (there were even candles in the room. candles!). It's true that Maroh narrates Clémentine and Emma's first time in five pages, and that's her fault if Kechiche's \"imagination\" goes too far - \"I want to do everything with you. Everything that is possible to be done in a life time\", says Clémentine to Emma - but if in the comic book the scenes are exciting, in the film is the opposite.\n\n\"You don't find it a pain a director explaining it all? When a director makes me over-analyze a scene or a character, showing everything, it closes off my imagination. I don't like it\".\n\nSometimes tender (Donna Deitch's Desert Hearts), sometimes hot (Zero Chou's Spider Lilies), sometimes \"explicit\" (Chantal Akerman's Je tu il elle), cinema's history is filled with beautiful scenes of love and sex between two women. We could claim that a woman understand it better, but let's not forget the terrible The Kids Are All Right, directed by Lisa Cholodenko, and the delicate 80 egunean, written and directed by José Mari Goenaga and Jon Garaño, not to mention Lukas Moodysson's Fucking Åmål, one of the best lesbian coming-of-age films, Lianna, Egymásra nézve, Bound and so many other lesbian films directed by men. Much has been said about Kechiche's fetishism as something exclusively male, but if today Blue is the Warmest Color is the apple of the eyes and the enfant terrible of the time, three years ago was The Kids Are All Right the one raising warm (for) and exalted (against) criticism. Apparently so distant - a lesbian and a straight director - what brings these two films together is, indeed, the male gaze: a heterosexual and sexist view of the feminine. This discussion, by the way, reminds me of John Cassavetes's explanation for the lack of sex scenes in his work, which films can be considered rather sexist by some people:\n\n\"I'm concerned about the depiction of women on the screen. It has gotten worse than ever. It's related to their being either high- or low-class concubines, and the only question is when or where they will go to bed and with whom and how many. (...) As for showing the sexual act in film, I think that's a lot of balls, phony, exploitative and commercial. It's cheap voyeurism and I think there's too damned much of it now anyway. (...) Playboy magazine, tit films and cocktail-party diatribes have not only affected our society but have shaped it with such discontent regarding men and women that sex is no longer in itself sufficient without violence, death or neurosis as stimulants. I don't think there's aznything morally wrong with seeing a nude body on the screen, but it offends me to watch people kiss without genuine love or passion. Sex on the screen bores me.\"\n\nIt's known that Maroh and so many other lesbians didn't like Kechiche's \"aesthetic approaches\", but for me, not only the \"so-called lesbian sex\" was \"brutal and surgical display, exuberant and cold which turned into porn\", but the whole picture. It's not Adèle that is voracious, Kechiche is; voracious, methodical and perfectionist. I can even imagine him shouting: \"Adèle, lift that ass up!\" Or, who knows, maybe measuring the lens'angle of view (i.e. Kechiche's thing for rear ends). As perfectly said by sociologist and gay activist Marie-Hélène Bourcier, the girl number of straight porn movies, where two girls go down on each other while waiting for a man to join them, is almost more honest, once the device is clear: a true voyeur shoots for guys. In Kechiche's case, she says , even if his thing is not wide open pussy (very pornovulgus), but nasal mucus and Adèle's gaping mouth, the voyeur device is present through its \"cock camera\" eager to close-ups. Indeed, his (oni) presence is so palpable that sometimes we have the impression of watching a ménage à trois not only sexual but also \"intellectual\", with Kechiche always standing out and offering the real pleasure: there are many artistic and literary references - Sartre , Francis Ponge , Choderlos de Laclos and Marivaux , whose novel La Vie de Marianne is a reference to the film's French title - however, Adèle's has a shallow depth (deeply shallow would be the right expression, but the photography technique shallow depth of field that consists in isolating \"part of the shot which is nicely in focus while throwing elements in the background - and sometimes the foreground - out of focus and into a lovely blur\" is exactly what Kechiche does in his film).\n\nAlthough Maroh is ok with the fact that Kechiche's heroin has a personality far from hers and thinks that what \"he developed is coherent, justified and fluid\", I think that turning Clémentine into a dull, monosyllabic and vulgar (bad table manners and so on) Adèle was his most brutal move. The world is full of bestsellers, alright, but Adèle loves to read, likes Kubrick and Scorsese, and doesn't know what Fine Arts are? Not to mention that Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele are not Picasso, but they are still quite known. Her bad manners, along with her lack of culture, far from representing certain voracity, show an exaggerated picture of the (simplistic, but good) working class in opposition to the (liberal, but \"mean\") intellectual/ high class, a point of view that is already quite clear in the selection of the leading actresses: Léa Seydoux, granddaughter of the Chairman of Pathé, \"comes from an extremely wealthy, bourgeois, very comfortable milieu\", while Adèle Exarchopoulos \"comes from something that is definitely much more modest\". Just by seeing some photos of the cast and watching the trailer, I knew that Adèle Exarchopoulos and Kechiche's Adèle were the same person. It's not a surprise to read that he chose her for the role after seeing her eating a lemon tarte, or to see, in interviews, that she speaks and behaves just like her character does. Kechiche opts for naturalism/realism, but more interesting and challenging would be to put the actresses in the opposite roles. One of the strongest points of the film, this social discourse could bring up an interesting discussion if not build on so many clichés. Nonetheless, like Boris says in Woody Allen's \"Whatever Works\", \"sometimes a cliché is finally the best way to make one's point\" and Kechiche sure does it showing how sexism is part of the gay community as well: Adèle, that has a \"minor\" job and a poor intellect is the good and helpful (house) wife; Lise, a cultured painter, but a mom and a femme, probably \"cooks for Emma when she gets home at night and gives her flowers in the morning\". The butch-femme relationship, an undeniable mirror of heterosexual relationships, usually perpetuates the so discussed stereotypes of male/female's roles.\n\nPerhaps I am becoming too much demanding or too much bitter, but although Léa Seydoux is very convincing as a lesbian, I didn't see anything fantastic about the performances. If the ending is painful, it is not because of Adèle Exarchopoulos's good acting, but because one can relate to such heartbreak. Loving is painful, growing old is hard, and we all know about it.\n\n\n- You don't love me anymore.\n\n- (no)... But I have infinite tenderness for you. I always will.\n\n\n\n\n* The burden of first love and Adèle's inability to move on slightly reminds me of Mia Hansen-Løve's film \"Goodbye First Love\".",

The unbridled and seamless character development t allows one to lose themselves  in this  non-action 3 hour film.  Perhaps, once in a decade a film like this appears, that grabs you beyond belief, but all too believable.  It is impossible not to fall in love with the actors, and their true to life credibility.  Adele Exachopoulous as Adele, is so beautiful to watch, and the Lea Seydoux, as Emma, as the relatively older woman  compliments the unfolding passion of Adele.  The explicit sex scenes lets us see erotic passion close up, and you really see how it is impossible for the characters not to fall in love after watching the first love scene between them.  I have heard the director got lot;'s of heat from both cast and crew, but the results is that rare description, that fits the bill for  the story, the acting, and direction- tour de force!",

The filmmaking is just perfect, you can't make more realistic.
