            "content": "Given the sorry state spoof films were in by the time Friedberg & Seltzer made their directorial debuts with Date Movie in 2006 and the unity in calling this movie dead on arrival, since, due to the fourth film being intended to be the final chapter, neither Anna Faris nor Regina Hall would show up, not even for a cameo, I was prepared to rip Scary Mo-Five-ie a new one. Instead, I thought it was just bland. It's a bad movie that is far less memorable than the quadrilogy but I was never truly shaking my head like with Disaster Movie. The acting's okay, there are some genuinely funny moments and the story at least keeps the focus on horror movies, mainly \"Mama\" with elements of \"Paranormal Activity\". Even the references are mostly confined to SCARY movies. And while, it references movies from the past two years, keep in mind the series that started it all did this too but was never attacked as much as later spoof movies because the focus was primarily horror movies. Unfortunately, while not the trainwreck I was expecting it to be, it's still deeply flawed. Ashley Tisdale lacks the same comedic timing as Anna Faris, though I think that's the fault of the material she has to work with, given one notable Disney voice role, making her character be more forgettable. The pointless \"Black Swan\" subplot doesn't help whereas the dumbass husband's \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" job at least tries to justify its inclusion in the A-story. While the jokes aren't obnoxious, they have the same bad tendency to either last longer than usual or are blatantly telegraphed. And finally, while the production values are better-looking than most of the Seltzerberg films, they still don't feel like they belong to a spoof film in 2013. It actually looks worse than two hard-R gross-out comedies that came out in the early 2000's. I get that horror movies have shoestring budgets, these types of comedies aren't expected to have breathtaking special effects and it was likely intentional given two scenes showing the protagonist and not-Brenda driving to and from their reference to the then-upcoming Evil Dead remake had a very obvious RC car with voiceovers but by 2013, most of us feel that this presentation lends itself better to YouTube videos than to a big-screen experience. So this fifth film that's not-so-secretly a reboot to a comedy classic with slightly-less-entertaining sequels wasn't the cringefest I was expecting but this movie didn't do much to establish that big-screen \"[Genre] Movie\" parodies were way past their prime. Close but Superhero Movie remains my guilty pleasure of this comedy subgenre.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, we just saw Scary Movie 5. I m still trying to process all the gags, carnage, and mayhem.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, this is the fifth in the series and the first not to follow the escapades of recurring characters Cindy Campbell and Brenda Meeks. It was penned by Pat Profit and Airplane! veteran David Zucker. It s a parody of several films including Mama and Black Swan. When you have one of the Zucker brothers involved you can expect an extreme farce. I was mildly disappointed.\n\nSCOTT: The word  disappointed doesnt exactly describe my reaction. But we ll get to that later. Let s run down the plot -- as if it really mattered in a movie like this. We start out with a bizarre bedroom scene involving Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, who play themselves in this movie. Sheen and Lohan are both haunted by an alien presence, who occupies Lohan s body, forcing her to kill Sheen, whose three children then become missing. Later, Snoop Dogg and a friend discover the children in a Cabin in the Woods -- yet another movie spoofed here. The three kids are then raised by Sheen s brother Dan (Simon Rex) and his wife Jodie (Ashley Tisdale).\n\nGREG: The movie then takes off parodying the heck out of Mama with paranormal activity such as the pool being overrun by automatic pool cleaners and pans falling from the kitchen ceiling. Meanwhile, Jodie is trying to get the lead in the local production of the ballet Black Swan. And that pretty much describes the whole film. From there it s just one set up gag after another.\n\nSCOTT: Greg, I really have mixed feelings about a movie like this. On the one hand, I appreciated the cleverness of the gags throughout. If you liked Airplane!, and you like parodies of scary movies, then this movie might be for you. I found myself chuckling here and there throughout most of the film. But I also found myself looking at my watch several times, hoping the movie would end. It basically works in small chunks, the way that a Saturday Night Live skit does. But 90 minutes was hard to sit through.\n\nGREG: I agree with you whole-heartedly. There were bits that were enjoyable, but usually they were the parts where Molly Shannon or Darrell Hammond from SNL provide cameos. And most of those bits were driven into the ground (like how everyone in the movie had a handi-cam and the Point of View was through the lens of either a handi-cam or security camera). And then there was the Cabin in the Woods scene where Jodie kept reading evil words and the Mormon Bible-thumpers upstairs turned into demons - over and over again. You re right, the bits were fun - once. But 90 minutes of repeating bad gags was too much. This could have easily been a hilarious 30-minute short.\n\nSCOTT: And therein lies the challenge of reviewing a movie like this. Like other gag-fests (e.g., Movie 43), it s unfair to compare it to conventional movies that actually attempt to deliver a coherent story with legitimate characters. Let s face it. The gags here are all that count and everything else serves as just an excuse to show the gags. The filmmakers were clearly going for shock value. Sometimes seeing something shocking is funny, and sometimes it s just plain dumb. Do we really need to see a baby s head set on fire? Is it necessary to show Heather Locklear s birthing fluids gush onto someone s face? Or popsicles and toothbrushes shoved up people s butts? Eww.\n\nGREG: I have to disagree with you, somewhat. I think a good parody will stand up against a traditional movie. When I saw the first Airplane! movie I laughed for a week and went back for seconds. When David Zucker is attached to a film, I expect something special. I expect sharp, smart writing. But, as you say, Scary Movie 5 was just an excuse to see blood spew and body parts detach - much like actual horror movies, in fact. I laughed at a few places, but I can only give it 1 Reel out of 5. As for the heroes, they were absent - a mere shadow of the characters that were being parodied. I give Scary Movie 5 an unprecedented zero Heroes. Movie: Hero: Zero.\n\nSCOTT: A good parody is hard to find these days. For me, the quintessential parody was 1999 s Galaxy Quest, a spoof of Star Trek that is every bit as good, if not better, than every Star Trek movie made. Scary Movie 5 was no Galaxy Quest, and in fact it wasn t even close. Scary Movie s gags were fast and furious, and the cameo appearances of brand-name actors were somewhat amusing. But there wasn t any meat on this bone. And I found myself gagging at the gags. Generously, I give this film 1 Reel out of 5. There were heroes (Dan and Jodie) but they were ridiculous heroes, and intentionally so. Ridiculous heroes get just 1 Hero out of 5. Movie: Hero:",

That being said, and considering the fact that I came off of watching A Haunted House 2 with its prolonged doll sex scene, I have to say I laughed in at least a couple parts.\n\nAs a franchise, Scary Movie has essentially stopped becoming a parody, and I say this as a firm believer in the genre. Parody is, at its heart, ingenious in its ability to convey the silliness in an otherwise serious genre. Intelligent parody takes a lot of creativity, just look at the Pythons, the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, etc. \n\nAt one point Scary Movie was a film to creatively parody the horror genre, particularly the slasher films of the 80's. Over time the parody went away, and what was left is the modern day equivalent to Ow My Balls! from Idiocracy, literally a series of people getting hit in the crotch. The public hasn't taken it well, given the series is progressively doing worse in the box office.\n\nThe big films in Scary Movie V are Mama, Paranormal Activity, Black Swan, and Planet of the Apes, with other references strewn throughout. Dan and Jody adopt the feral children of his deceased brother, Charlie Sheen, while their demonic mother causes terror in their heavily camera-laden house. Jody, meanwhile, wants to become a ballerina.\n\nAs a comedy, Scary Movie V is almost scientific in its ability to take the worst jokes and play them on a loop. How many times the Mama character started doing the robot in horror-speed (read: fast forwarding the film 2x), I couldn't tell you. The short jokes are repeated far too much and the long jokes continue way past their expiration date.\n\nIf I were to categorize the jokes, the majority would fall on Simon Rex, either him being injured, inadvertently injuring someone else, or being unaware of his own stupidity.\n\nIn second place would be the jokes about the family's maid, Maria. Maria is hilarious because she's not only fat and Mexican, she also loves Jesus. Luckily the film constantly reminds us of these points, with Maria either cleaning, very loudly pooping, or doing something related to the cross. And speaking in Mexican.\n\nThe best parts of Scary Movie V come from the Black Swan portions, where I will admit I cracked up watching Molly Shannon do ballet moves while constantly balancing a cigarette and a martini. Shannon is the only actress whose performance is consistently solid, which really sets her apart from the rest of the crew.\n\nThe bad news is that Scary Movie VI is a given, since while the box office grosses continue to drop, so does the budget, making the film still profitable. The budget for Scary Movie V is reportedly $20 million, just slightly above the first movie back in 2000. If Scary Movie IX has to be filmed on the budget of a McDonald's Happy Meal and only one person goes to see it, you can bet that a sequel will find its way to theaters.",

In this fifth instalment, slapstick runs rather dry and many, many gags outstay their welcome. Hits like Inception, Black Swan and Mama are spoofed earning some healthy laughs but many dated cultural references and pop culture gags fall flat, this isn't as bad as the first two Scary Movie films but it's certainly one of the weakest, reaching to the bottom of the barrel in desperation.\r\n\r\nScary MoVie sees young parents Dan and Jody raise their adopted nieces who have a twisted spirit overlooking them. Jody begins to experience paranormal activity in their new home, and soon realises an evil dead demon is stalking them, Jody must now venture to the cabin in the woods to find the book of the dead and stop the deadly curse, whilst Dan focuses on his job at the Ape research facility. The problem here is too many big films are being spoofed, from Inception, Black Swan, Mama, Evil Dead, Paranormal Activity, Insidious, The Cabin In The Woods, even Tyler Perry's Madea and Fifty Shades Of Grey. Writers David Zucker and Pat Proft cram it all in, the film is bursting at its seams with a lot of bad jokes and a feeling of desperation. The scenes where Simon Rex falls over whilst trying to set up the cameras drove me mental as it wasn't funny, the fight between Dan and Rosa, and the repetition of the Cabin in the woods joke fizzled out quicker than you can say boring. The dancing Mama and the Ape's talking about Matt Damon really killed hope, there's so much that falls flat, the Fifty Shades Of Grey scene was pointless and the Inception scene really felt forced. \r\n\r\nHowever, the whole Black Swan sequences work superbly, the Evil Dead book scene was hilarious and the opening with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan ripping their personal lives maybe lousy but it works. Erica Ash is superb as Kendra, J.P. Manoux is very funny as Pierre the ballet teacher, and Molly Shannon reels out some big laughs as a broken, alcoholic smoking professional dancer, there are some great jokes here, Ashley Tisdale is great at slapstick and she echoes an Anna Faris in the making, although Faris cannot be beat when it comes to these films. The found footage aspects are decent, especially when exploring their new home, seeing Jody smack the baby into the door frame, setting its head on fire then blasting fire extinguishers reign madness, it's unapologetically poor humour but I chuckled.\r\n\r\nRunning in at under feature length, Scary Movie 5 feels long and exhausting, it tries to be something big but it really is just a squashed mixed bag labelled as a movie, and Director Malcolm D. Lee does nothing to polish or let alone add craft to this tiresome spoof.",

The first problem is that the basis of the film is the film: Mama, which was okay at best and definitely didn't deserve this much credit.  There are so many jokes that a few hit and are funny, but most fall flat and are stupid; I actually liked the Inception bit quite a bit.  Overall I'm guessing this will be the last one, which is unfortunate as I've liked most of the Scary Movie films, but if this is what is to be expected I hope they don't make anymore.",

If they had just stuck with the Paranormal Activity and Mama story lines, they might have been able to pull off a decent movie. The Black Swan, The Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, and Fifty Shades Of Grey scenes just didn't flow with the rest of the parodies. I know it's supposed to be dumb, but it can still have a coherent narrative. Instead, this movie gives you a bunch of random parodies and crude jokes duct-taped together to make a crappy comedy.\n\nMost of the jokes seem like they were the first thought that came to the writers. I'll improvise a Scary Movie 5 scene right now off the top of my head: \"A guy tries to open a kitchen drawer but it's stuck, so the guy braces his leg against the counter and finally the drawer comes out and hits the guy in the nuts really hard. The guy lays on the floor in agony and finally sits up, only to hit his head on the drawer.\" This is what a typical scene in Scary Movie 5 is like. It's a bunch of jokes that haven't been thought out.\n\nIt does have it's moments, but for the most part Scary Movie 5 comes off as just a half-hearted attempt at humor. If they concentrate more on poking fun at the movies they are parodying and less on the lowest of low brow jokes, they might actually be able to keep this franchise popular. They also need to stick to parodies of movies they've actually SEEN and not just saw the trailer [which is what they did for The Evil Dead remake]. I've seen much worse parody films, but this one still isn't very good.",

            "content": "As I entered the theater to view Scary Movie 5, I had a feeling that it would be a lousy movie. I mean, I knew what I was getting into. Truth is, I probably shouldn't have gone. My ten dollars along with the $10 contribution of millions of other moviegoers is the main reason why these films continue to get made. Like I said in my previous review of Scary Movie (2000), these turkeys don't cost a lot to make. This one was probably around $20 million. It ended up making a little more than $60 million worldwide. Which brings me to my next thought, I don't think the people working on them care whether they are bad or not. They know that the misguided audience member will somehow get duped into thinking they're seeing something relevant. But after 80-85 short nutrition free minutes (that's the normal running time), they as an audience, just wasted an amount of life that will never come back. Every second counts you know in the stratosphere that is movie land. \n\n\n\n\nNow I liked the first Scary Movie. As I stated in my review of it, I thought it was the first of its kind. Just like Airplane (1980) spoofed airports and flying, this one was an original spoof of horror films. But they really should have stopped after the first one. I remember seeing the last 20 minutes of it and realized that a sequel would not work, should not work, and will not work. Scary Movie 5 makes some big mistakes, humongous I tell you. The first is having it be rated PG-13. That's difficult to pull off because the tone is lazy. Everyone is basically trying to project R rated humor in a PG-13 film. I guess the studios are trying to bring in a younger crowd. This is, in my opinion, is to make money. What a silly way of thinking. The first Scary Movie was a huge box office success. It had the cojones to push the envelope on gross out humor. That's why I recommend it even to this day. Scary Movie 5 is a tired exercise that maybe belts out three and four genuine guffaws, that's it. Then there is the second mistake this film commits which is trying to spoof the Paranormal Activity movies. It would have worked had it been done maybe 4 or 5 years ago when it was a fresh concept in everybody's mind. But just like the Scary Movie franchise, there have been I guess three Paranormal Activity sequels/prequels ever since. And let's face it, those movies have pretty much already spoofed or parodied themselves. Finally, there is the preview of this movie which I saw a couple times before viewing the actual product. Some of the scenes in it were actually kinda funny. Guess what, almost none of them are in the final cut. Are you kidding me, wow what a clever bait and switch.\n\n\n\n\nI could go on and on how disposable this film is but I'll refrain. Here's one more tidbit: Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan do a cameo in the first five minutes of Scary Movie 5. It was probably the funniest portion of the movie. I kinda wondered why they weren't the stars and had been asked to carry the weight. But who are we kidding, their movie careers have already been dented enough. I'm starting to wonder if they even wanted to get things back on track. I guess not. Oh a lot of washed up entertainers seem to taint the heck out of this movie. In addition to Sheen and   we have Snoop Dogg, Heather Locklear, Molly Shannon, Jerry O'Connell, Jasmine Guy (yeah, I couldn't make this up if I tried), and Mike Tyson (he was in the film for 10 seconds, good for him). They must be really desperate to be on screen cause it seems we haven't seen them in a long while.\n\n\n\n\nHere's another thing I was wondering though, did the actual Morgan Freeman do the narration for Scary Movie 5 or was someone imitating him. Lord I hope not because if it was actually Freeman, I might have to stop going to movies forever. I might be scarred for life.\n\n\n\n\nIf you really wanna to check out this abomination, it's your choice. Just stay away from the closing credits. They're outtakes that are much worse than the movie itself. And they feel staged like they were actually scripted. Yeah I payed my ten bucks and sat in the theater. If I had to do it over again, I'd probably just go home and watch dust form. That's quality entertainment compared to this.",

            "content": "After a long 7 years, Scary Movie 5 arrives and in short this is hands down one of the worst movies of the year and possibly one of the worst comedies ever made. It is very hard to call this a movie at all due to the sheer fact that nothing in this movie is entertaining. You know the story of the Scary Movie franchise, they take alot of recent horror movies and mash them together to parody them. The first and thrid Scary Movie films were good, 2 was decent, and 4 was pretty bad; however 5 is just the lowest of the low in this franchise. The \"story\", if you can call it that, is the same as Mama and they just allude to other films that came out this year such as Evil Dead, A Haunted House, and Paranormal Activity. The fact that this movie tried to spoof 2 films that came out this year literally a couple months before the release of this film is just astonishing. How can they possibly pull all of this into one movie in such a short amount of time. Then again, that is probably where this movie wen't horribly wrong. You can tell that this movie was rushed through just for the possibility of earning one dollar. The cast in this movie is as low rent as can be with Ashley Tisdale, Charlie Sheen, Snoop Dogg/Lion, Katt Williams, Mike Tyson, Molly Shannon, Heather Locklear, Little Bow Wow, and Lindsay Lohan all wasting their time and giving as little effort as possible. I am really not sure what more I can say about this, It is not funny, not original, and gives parodies a worse name than it had before. David Zucker, the writer and director of Airplane and The Naked Gun, made parody movies great, and to see that he actually wrote this makes parody a truly dead art. Skip this movie, it is not worth any of you time and definitely not your money.",

They are all loosely tied together with Ashley Tisdale and Simon Rex proudly nailing closed the coffins of their careers.\r\n\r\nEven the best section which features a group of clean cut bible posturing teens lead by \"Teen Wolf\"'s Tyler Posey falls flat.  The worst segment features Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen making stupid comments about their bad career choices while doing a \"Paranormal Activity\" send up.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say the film is pretty bad all the way around.  I am often asked why I continue to seek out and see movies that are bad.  I must do it.  Along with the good I gotta see the bad.  Not only do I enjoy seeing great films, but I also enjoy going after the ones that I think are terrible.

I could almost recommend parts of it just for the sake of it's strangeness, as you put your chin on your fists and letting befuddlement crease your brow, gazing perplexed as you wonder the Many Questions of the competent thinker. Did anyone get fired after this? How did it pass test screenings? Were the actors as embarrassed as they look and sound? Who is Ashley Tisdale? Every year I feel more and more removed from cinema as an art form, this year being particularly brutal, not even counting this.

Mocking the 'Paranormal Activity' movies and 'Mama' was the primary goal here, but somehow, they managed to throw in 'Black Swan', 'Inception', and 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' too.  While all those movies have mockable scenarios, none were effectively ridiculed.  Plus, with no real talent leading this thing - Ashley Tisdale (A Bug's Life) and Simon Rex (Superhero Movie) bear the brunt of the cringe-worthy scenes - it was left to Charlie Sheen (\"Two and a Half Men\"), Molly Shannon (Hotel Transylvania), Darrell Hammond (Epic Movie), Terry Crews (The Expendables 2), and Snoop Dogg to mumble their way through corny dialogue and general awfulness.  It's no real surprise that Lindsay Lohan (Mean Girls) landed in this thing though. She'll probably do anything at this point for a paycheck.

They based the movie around Mama with a touch of Evil Dead, Black Swan and the Cabin In The Woods, but they didn't do the movies any justice. The writers really didn't do a good job and most of the actors are either in debt or have suffered a slump in there careers. I'm not a big fan of the Scary Movie franchise, so I got what I expected from this film. Judging by the money that this movie has made, I sure that they will be releasing more movies in this franchise, but I personally think that they should look for some better writers or just leave the series alone. Terrible!\n\nRound-Up:\nThe out takes at the end of the movie are much funnier than the actual film itself. There are loads of innuendo's which refer to other movies but they weren't that cleverly done. Tyson had sunk to a all time low by making an idiot of himself in this movie, as well as Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan who have gone through there own personal turmoils of late. If they were using this movie to boost there careers, they have definitely picked the wrong film.\n\nBudget: $20million\nWorldwide Gross: $64million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are fans of the Scary Movie franchise, but don't expect much. 1/10",

They've taken the series (once directed by Airplane! and Naked Gun spoof expert David Zucker) and turned it into the same garbage as Epic Movie and Vampires Suck. I know a lot of you already hate the series, but it was actually funny when it lampooned HORROR movies. This is why spoofs nowadays suck; instead of making fun of a genre, they try to make fun of everything and the jokes fail... horribly. Why Scary Movie V lampoons Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Inception, and Black Swan is beyond me (in fact, there's also a reference to The Help... why is this movie stuck in 2011?). There are jokes about Madea, stupid reality show wives, and Honey Boo Boo and they are embarrassing and unfunny. \n\nBefore I completely trash it, there are some okay jokes that parody Mama, Paranormal Activity, and the Evil Dead remake... notice that these are all HORROR movies; just stick to what's ridiculous in the genre and you'll have a halfway decent movie. Scary Movie V is just sad. I guess it had to take a turn for the worse someday.",

            "content": "I have been quite an avid fan of the Scary Movie series, merely because they offer some pretty hilarious parodies of popular culture and famous films, usually of the horror genre. When I heard that they were releasing Scary Movie 5, I was pretty excited until I checked the trailer. Brenda and Cindy are not the protagonists anymore, despite the fact that Charlie Sheen and Dan returned to star in it. When I learned about that, I opted not to go to the cinema to watch the movie. Well, while I do not regret not going to the theatre to catch it, it is still a passable entry to the series, I'd say. \n\nThe story's main storyline parodies those of 2013's Mama and the Paranormal Activity franchise, with elements from popular films like Black Swan, Sinister, Inception, Fifty Shades of Grey, Evil Dead and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Dan's nieces and nephew are found in a cabin in the woods (The Cabin in the Woods reference) and he and his wife, Jody, (played by Ashley Tisdale) are to take care of them, only to learn that they are haunted by an apparition named 'Mama'. The entire film is narrated by a faux Morgan Freeman voice, which is pretty impressive and convincing. The story soon develops into a slightly-above-average climax, ending quite positively, though hinting possibilities that the human race will soon fall and the apes shall take over (Rise of the Planet of the Apes). \n\nOn the main aspects, surprisingly, the acting is, while pretty wooden in places, pretty good for a comedy. It makes the film all the more better that way. To have Lindsay Lohan parody herself is simply amazing, I have to say. I absolutely love her for that. Charlie Sheen, too. Those two put together do make a sizzling and wildly hilarious copulation in the beginning (despite the fact that the scene, inspired by the fast-forward bedroom scene from Paranormal Activity, has been over-parodied before). While Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash as Jody Sanders and Kendra Brooks (replacing Cindy and Brenda, respectively) are what I would say quite passable Scary Movie protagonists, they still cannot surpass Cindy and Brenda. Screenplay, clumsy, but it's a comedy, so probably intentional. \n\nTechnical aspects, nothing out of the ordinary, although I have to say set pieces are quite impressive. Visual effects are pretty minimum, and mostly resemble those used in modern B movies. The cinematography is not too bad. It really captures the very dark and film noir look - somewhat like Inception. \n\nOverall, not the best entry in the series but passable, I'd say. Sufficiently hilarious, mind-bogglingly random and greatly entertaining.",

These things are usually completely random, but this one stays relatively grounded, using the plotline of Mama as the main backbone of the story.  It's no secret that I've never been an advocate for these spoof movies that don't try, and while this is nowhere near as offensive as those Jason Friedberg/Aaron Seltzer collaborations, that can hardly be taken as a recommendation.  Apparently, there's no limit to how many of these movies we can get per calendar year, as we just got A Haunted House a few months beforehand, and we are due to get The Starving Games in November.  In a word, this is lazy, or at least as lazy as you would expect it to be; it's referential for the sake of being referential, and the comedy consists of constant pratfalls, celebrity cameos and the occasional groin injury.  The thing that is most inappropriate here is not the lowbrow humor, it's the choices they make on what movies to parody; yes, Paranormal Activity and Evil Dead are completely apropos and even expected, but then you have running plot threads from Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Inception, and even Black Swan, which just leads you to question who exactly is writing this, and why are they 2-3 years late to the punch?  All of these spoof movies are practically interchangeable with each other, and Scary MoVie is just more of the same.",

The opening set up features Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan in bed with an over-exaggerated sex sequence and inside jokes about their recent \"public\" embarrassments.  That goes nowhere.  Same for the remaining 75 minutes.  This stuff has been done to death and with David Zucker, of Airplane, co-writing the film, it's so sad.  The slapstick would shame the Three Stooges; the acting is typically C-rated stars is bad and the 12 minute out-take reel at the end...desperate.  Nothing works, just a series of disjointed forced sequences amounting to nothing.  Here's hoping this is the last of the Scary Movie franchise.",

Scary Movie 5 is not only the WORST movie in the franchise, it also is an insult to parody movies, and to comedy itself.\n\n The movie frames itself around Paranormal Activity, a young couple Jody (Ashley Tisdale) and Dan (Simon Rex) bring their newborn son home from the hospital unusual things start happening and they must use home surveillance to discover that they are being hunted be a demon. This is the premise of the story, I don't want to go further into it because really that is about it.\n\n The movie prides itself on Sheen and Lohan laughing at their own personal lives and how low they have fallen and this is not something to be celebrated, especially in a movie that doesn't do it well. There are some celebrity cameos with Usher, Mike Tyson and Snoop Dogg gracing themselves in this mess.\n\n Apart from the horrid cameos the movie is parodying films that are too old, Black Swan? What? Who even remembers that now? Seriously? Inception? Talk about outdated material!\n\n There are a lot of reasons NOT to see this movie, the main one is that Tisdale is NO Ana Faris and excuse me producers, how could you make a Scary Movie without the character of Brenda?? YOU JUST CAN'T!\n\n This disaster should put a pin in any further installments into the Scary Movie franchise, especially when there is no humour, love or wit in it.

Scary Movie 5 is in NO way a continuation of the previous four entries into the franchise and gone is any reference to the character played by Anna Faris in the originals -- who was a send-up of Neve Campbell's character from the Scream films.  Scary Movie 5 instead heavily mocks the Paranormal Activity films by using both hand-held and recovered footage of a family inspired by the film, Mama -- its other primary source material.  Simon Rex and Ashley Tisdale play a couple -- him an uncle of two and her his alt-rock girlfriend musician -- who take in his brother's two orphaned children who had survived in the wilderness by being looked after by a spooky creature the kids can only see they call Mama.  Yes ... the plot has been completely ripped-off ... and skewered with additional portions of other spoof-worthy films such as Sinister and The Evil Dead.  The moments that actually made me enjoy this movie over HH is its somewhat inspired use of two unlikely films -- the (both) brainy Inception and Black Swan.  Inspired by the dream aspect of Inception and the mindbending attributes of Black Swan, Scary Movie 5 at least gives its viewer a few non-typical laughs.  The very first reference to Black Swan did make me chuckle ... and I don't even remember what it was ... I just thought its inclusion was interesting to say the least.  It is a given that it is overtly juvenile and that has been the purpose of ALL Scary Movies.  It isn't supposed to be taken seriously and it tries to remind other films that they aren't supposed to be either.  This movie will only appeal to those who like \"dumb\" things and enjoy low-brow comedy and want to laugh.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you can beat my 4 chuckles -- as in you'd need fewer.",

            "content": "Scary Movie 5\n\nSCOTT:  Greg, we just saw Scary Movie 5.  I'm still trying to process all the gags, carnage, and mayhem.\n\nGREG:  Scott, this is the fifth in the series and the first not to follow the escapades of Cindy Campbell and Brenda Meeks. It was penned by Pat Profit and Airplane! veteran David Zucker. It's a parody of several films including \"Mama\" and \"Black Swan.\" When you have one of the Zucker brothers involved you can expect an extreme farce. And I wasn't disappointed.\n\nSCOTT:  The word 'disappointment' definitely doesn't describe my reaction, either.  But we'll get to that later.  Let's run down the plot -- as if it really mattered in a movie like this.\n\nWe start out with a bizarre bedroom scene involving Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, who play themselves in this movie.  Sheen and Lohan are both haunted by an alien presence, who occupies Lohan's body, forcing her to kill Sheen, whose three children then become missing.  Later, Snoop Dogg and a friend discover the children in a Cabin in the Woods -- yet another movie referenced here.  The three kids are then raised by Sheen's brother Dan and his wife Jodie.\n\nGREG:  The movie then takes off parodying the heck out of \"Mama\" with paranormal activity such as the pool being overrun by automatic pool cleaners and pans falling from the kitchen ceiling. Meanwhile, Jodie is trying to get the lead in the local production of the ballet \"Black Swan.\" And that pretty much sets up the whole film. From there it's just one set up gag after another.\n\nSCOTT:  Greg, I really have mixed feelings about a movie like this.  On the one hand, I appreciated the cleverness of the gags throughout.  If you liked Airplane, and you like parodies of scary movies, then this movie is for you.  I found myself chuckling occasionally throughout most of the film.  But I also found myself looking at my watch several times, hoping the movie would end.  It basically works in small chunks, the way that a Saturday Night Live skit does.  But 90 minutes was hard to sit through.\n\nGREG:  I agree with you whole-heartedly. There were bits that were enjoyable, but usually they were the parts where Molly Shannon or Darrell Hammond from SNL show up. And most of them were driven into the ground (like how everyone in the movie had a handi-cam and the Point of View was through the lens of either a handi-cam or security camera.) And then there was the Cabin in the Woods scene where Jodie kept reading evil words and the Mormon Bible-thumpers upstairs turned into demons - over and over again. You're right, the bits were fun - once. But 90 minutes of repeating bad gags was too much. This could have easily been a hilarious 30-minute short.\n\nSCOTT:  And therein lies the challenge of reviewing a movie like this.  Like other spoofs (e.g., Movie 43), it's unfair to compare it to conventional movies that actually attempt to deliver a coherent story with legitimate characters.  Let's face it.  The gags here are all that count and everything else serves as just an excuse to show the gags.\n\nThe filmmakers were clearly going for shock value.  Sometimes seeing something shocking is funny, and sometimes it's just plain dumb.  Do we really need to see a baby's head set on fire?  Is it necessary to show Heather Locklear's birthing fluids gush onto someone's face?  Or popcycles and toothbrushes shoved up people's butts?  Eww.\n\nGREG:  I have to disagree with you, somewhat. I think a good parody will stand up against a traditional movie. When I saw the first Airplane! movie I laughed for a week and went back for seconds. When David Zucker is attached to a film, I expect something special. I expect sharp, smart writing. But, as you say, this was just an excuse to see blood spew and body parts detach - much like actual horror movies, in fact. I laughed at a few bits in Scary Movie 5, but I can only give it 1 Reel out of 5. As for the heroes, they were absent - a mere shadow of the characters that were being parodied. I give Scary Movie 5 zero Heroes.\n\nSCOTT:  A good parody is hard to find these days.  For me, the quintessential parody was 1999's Galaxy Quest, a spoof of Star Trek that is every bit as good, if not better, than every Star Trek movie made.  \n\nScary Movie 5 was no Galaxy Quest, and in fact it wasn't even close.  Scary Movie's gags were fast and furious, the cameos from brand-name actors were somewhat amusing, but there wasn't any meat on this bone.  Generously, I give this film 1 Reel out of 5.  There were heroes (Dan and Jodie) but they were ridiculous heroes, and intentionally so.  Alas, a ridiculous hero gets just 1 Hero out of 5.",

It involves films such as paranormal activity, black swan, sinister, mama, inception, fifty shades of gray, Rise of the Planet of Apes, and more. It stars Ashley Sheen and Simon Rex as the two main leads. It is about three orphaned children, two little girls and a baby, and how their mama wants them back to kill them. It also has Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan in a small roles, about how a cabin is haunted. I like how it has Tyler Posey, MTV's Teen Wolf star as Scott McCall, in a small, funny,role. He is shown when Tisdale's character enters the cabin, like in \"The Cabin in the Woods, and the funny scene is based off of the movie, \"Evil Dead\".",

I liked how a lot the horror movies that were spoofed in Scary Movie 5 were recent movies that have just been in theaters such as Mama, Sinister, and The Evil Dead.

And that's all its capable of.  I am a fan of the original Scary Movie, which made we laugh out loud.  This movie if anything proves the franchise should have ended a LONG time ago.  If there is a story to this idiotic sequel, it does what it was made to do.  The films mix a variety of pop culture references, sickening humor, uncomical violence, and laughs made to make fun of the horror genre.  The Scary Movies have become an immature style of entertainment.  While they certainly are a success when it comes to the box office, they're otherwise a failed attempt at a comedy (let alone a movie).   In short, if you want to see the unoriginal, badly acted, horribly written, low budget addition to the Scary Movie franchise, be my guest.  Meanwhile I will go see something actually worthwhile and decent.  People always make fun of the Paranormal Activity franchise and films like it.  People may laugh at that franchise but at least it's received GOOD reviews.  Either way I will be laughing at this film rather than with it and that alone should make people realize how much I hate this series!",

They discover all kinds of creepy stuff going on around their house that doesn't seem to be just tied to ghosts...\n\n\"I'm going to blow you across the room!\"\n\"Sounds awesome.\"\n\nMalcolm D. Lee, director of Undercover Brother, Soul Men, Roll Bounce, and Welcome Home, Roscoe Jenkins, delivers Scare Movie 5.  The storyline for this picture is on par with the previous pictures but the comedic content was pretty good.  There was definitely some laugh at loud moments mixed with some corny scenes.  The acting was as you would expect from this genre of picture with some nice cameos thrown in.\n\n\"Do me a favor.  Promise me you won't drive.\"\n\"That's sweet.  You're worried about me driving?\"\n\"I'm worried about me.  I'm a pedestrian.\"\n\nI caught this movie at the drive-in this past weekend and actually liked it way more than I anticipated.  It is far from a great film or comedic masterpiece; however, I definitely found myself laughing more than I anticipated.  I wouldn't go out of my way to see this, but I wouldn't completely skip it either.  This is definitely worth watching once when it airs on cable.\n\n\"Your safe word is...deeper.\"\n\nGrade: C+",

The acting, script, cheesy one liners were just awful all in all, making fun of movies that generated more money in the first week of release than all 5 scary movies generated all together.

It's been many years since \"Scary Movie 4\", so there's a lot of movies and pop culture gags to parody and just choose the less convenient. And how results? Just boring and sometimes graceless and sometimes not. At least, the previous installments (either recycled as this film) has its funny moments, but damn, \"Scary Movie V\" with stale sense of humor, ruins another franchise with the passage of time. David Zucker as the director/writer sucks for have some strength to the film. Recognition to Charlie Sheen to return to the film as funny as before.

What followed was a bunch of repetitive jokes about people being hit repeatedly in the head, pop culture references that missed tale mark, and sub oar acting. Did I expect Oscar quality? Not in the slightest, but it was painfully bad. It makes an effort to spoof Inception and Black Sean, but they came out in 2010 so it isn't even relevant to try to parody at this point. Anna Farris and Regina Hall, main cast from 1-4, are even sloppily replaced by another blonde Ashly Tisdale and her stereotypical black friend.\n\nAccording to Rotten Tomatoes, 79% of audiences liked it and it showed in my theater too. People laughed their heads off while I just sat there. The fact that people thought something this bland and poorly thrown together says something about our society. It's one of the only films I have ever eat through to which I felt ashamed at myself for the price of admission. I went home and showered right after, because of how dirty tis movie made me feel. There are currently little to no comedies in theaters right now so Scary Movie sadly still has the market cornered, but if you want a movie where you can watch the audience wet themselves with hilarity as you lose all faith in humanity than this is the movie for you.

I can't even compare it to any other movie because its not the bad jokes that make this horrible.... its how it was made. There are some occasional Black Swan parody moments that actually are indicative of what a parody should be and are shockingly presented well. However that is probably a minute out of the film. Characters appear with no explanation of who they are and then almost never seen again. Most of the dialogue in this film is ADR and a lot doesn't even match the mouth of the actors. Also, a large percentage of this movie is basically fast forwarded (which is supposed to be funny) or the characters driving in an obviously fake model toy car. Everything is just thrown at the screen (just as much as feces is thrown at a wall in this movie) with no plot. \n\nYou get the feeling that half of the movie was replaced with newly made footage which they just shoved in there without trying to put it in a cohesive way. It comes across as an exercise in poor filmmaking at its finest. \n\nA truly horrible excuse of film that should never have been released.. The Weinsteins should be embarrassed. The only way this could have been remotely watchable is if they stuck with an entire Black Swan parody. Nothing here feels like you're watching a film. Incredibly poorly done and edited. It's so bizarre. There is an entire scene with pool cleaners having sex with each other. I don't even know what I just watched.

            "content": "\"Just as bad as the Friedberg and Seltzer films\"\nMovie Review: Scary Movie 5\nDate Viewed: April 18 2013\nDirected by Malcolm D. Lee (Roll Bounce and Undercover Brother)\nWritten by Pat Proft and David Zucker, based on characters created by Shawn Wayans & Marlon Wayans & Phil Beauman & Buddy Johnson and Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer.\nStarring: Ashley Tisdale, Simon Rex, Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, Terry Crews, Katrina Bowden, Bow Wow, Molly Shannon, Heather Locklear, Kate Walsh, Snoop Dogg, Mac Miller, Katt Williams, Erica Ash, Mike Tyson, Tyler Posey, Sarah Hyland, Lil Duval, Lewis Thompson, Big Ang, Sheree Whitfield, J.P. Manoux, Jasmine Guy, Ben Cornish, Darrell Hammond, and Usher.\n\n\"Scary Movie 5\" was almost a landmark for me in the 9 years I've been reviewing movies this is the closest I've ever come to walking out half way through the film. After this experience I wish I had.\n\nBelieve it or not it's the fifth installment of this horror spoof franchise that like Freddy Kruger and Jason (from Friday The 13th) just won't die. If you're looking for laughs you won't find them anywhere but if you're looking for scary things in this movie wait till you meet Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan (playing themselves) in bed together.\n\nNote to Charlie Sheen: Getting in bed with Lindsay Lohan and getting hit in the groin by paranormal activity is not exactly WINNING! You are just going through the motions and cashing in a big paycheck.\n\n\"Scary Movie 5\" as usual like the other four films in the series targets a lot of popular films including the recent Evil Dead remake, Mama, Black Swan, Inception, Sinister, The Cabin in the Woods, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, of course the Paranormal Activity franchise, Insidious and yes even Madea (played in drag not memorable by Lewis Thompson who believe it is an even worse actor than Tyler Perry).\n\nThis is maybe the most untalented C-minus cast in any movie in history (probably below That's My Boy) also in this film is Ashley Tisdale (of \"High School Musical\"), the dimwitted Simon Rex, Molly Shannon, J.P. Manoux (as the unfunny stereotype of the gay talking ballet teacher), Snoop Dogg and Mac Miller also playing themselves, Terry Crews, Katt Williams, Sarah Hyland (of TV's Modern Family), Heather Locklear, Mike Tyson also playing himself, Jerry O'Connell, Kate Walsh, Darrell Hammond, Lil Duval, Erica Ash, Tyler Posey, Bow Wow (a long way from his debut in 2002's Like Mike), Usher and Katrina Bowden (who last year if you remember a piranha came out of her vagina in \"Piranha 3DD\").\n\nThe acting is atrocious and it is not funny if Simon Rex gets hit in the head so many times by pots and pans, or Ashley Tisdale having sex with a microwave, or gorillas throwing feces in the wall, or Snoop Dogg and Mac Miller looking for weed in a cabin in the woods, or Heather Locklear whose water  breaks all over the stage while performing ballet, or haunted pool cleaners inviting  haunted vacuum cleaners having a pool party, smoking pot and vomiting.\n\nI found \"Scary Movie 5\" just sad and depressing. And what about bad timing, why release \"Scary Movie 5\" after another soon to be unfunny horror spoof came out three months ago called \"A Haunted House\" (which I haven't seen yet) starring and co-written by Marlon Wayans who was the co-star and co-writer for the first two movies in the series.\n\nDirector Malcolm D. Lee (who made the godawful Martin Lawrence comedy \"Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins\" 5 years ago) is just as bad as Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer  who were responsible for ruining the spoof genre in the first place with Vampires Suck, Disaster Movie, Meet The Spartans, Epic Movie and cetera.\n\nNot only has Sheen and Lohan hit rock bottom what about co-writer David Zucker (who last directed Scary Movie 3 & 4) the genre he co-created with \"Airplane!\" in 1980 is now pretty much dead and has not made anything funny in I don't know how many years.\n\nAs for Mike Tyson, he has less screen time here than he had in \"The Hangover\" but his performance in \"Hangover\" was Marlon Brando by comparison to his role in \"Scary Movie 5\".\n\n\"Scary Movie 5\" is the cinematic equivalent of 10 year old boys looking at PLAYBOY and MadTV magazines for the first time.",

I really hate these movies, I mean really hate these stupid movies because none of them are funny, none of there jokes are funny and none of the satire is funny. Now, some people might think I hate spoof movies and that's why I hate the Scary Movies, but that's not true because there are spoof movies I find hilarious, like the movie Hotshots was hilarious, The Naked Gun movies were hilarious and the movie Airplane is one of my favorite comedies. So yeah, spoof movies can actually be funny if you have good satire and you have a funny script, but these Scary Movies don't have funny scripts or good satire. So, for some reason they just had to make a fiftth installment to the Scary Movie franchise, why did they do this? I have no idea, porbably they just wanted to make more money off these supid ass movies. Scary Movie 5 pretty much spoofs movies like, Paranormal Activity, Mama, Evil Dead and for some reason they also spoof, Inception and Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The humour in this movie is of course terrible even for Scary Movie standards because I have never seen such immature jokes in a movie, seriously the jokes were childish the only people that would laugh at any joke in this movie are young kids. I think the worse thing out of all this was that this movie directed by David Zucker the guy who wrote and direct, The Naked Gun movies and Airplane. David Zucker obviously knows how to make really funny movies, so I'm really surprised he actually directed this terrible movie. Anyways, Scary Movie 5 is a movie that no one should bother to see, the first four Scary Movies are incredibly unfunny and the movie, A Haunted House is even more unfunny, but this movie Scary Movie 5 is even more unfunny then all of those movies, so yeah, I suggest everyone to avioid this piece of crap.",

I tell you where, they're all been flushed down the toilet! Now if Jim Abraham were to come back and helped the poor guy with this movie, then this movie would probably be a whole lot better! But too bad it didn't happen! I for one still want to see a real good spoof and that is real funny for everyone to get a joy out of! Now I can see why this is called Scary Movie and not Spoof Movie cause it's scary without the spoofs even when only David Zucker is directing it. So when David fails to make Scary Movie 5  funny, then the movie becomes really scary to watch! Be warned, don't watch! This movie will creep you out with laughter at his failed attempt! Shame on you Zucker for trying to make everyone a sucker for watching your unfunny movie.\n\nBy the way, thank goodness I watched this movie with a free ticket.",

            "content": "You know exactly what you're getting when you watch a parody movie like Scary Movie 5. And that's exactly what it gives you. A mish mash of all your favourite horror movies over the last few years slapped together and made fun of. As a narrative there is usually the central plot, which in this one is based off Paranormal Activity and Mama, with other references in there. Most of the jokes are OK, but they do set up some great laughs as well. The Scary Movies have always worked better for me than other parodies like the woeful Epic Movie and Date Movie as it's the opposite end of the movie spectrum to the movies it's parodying. People like to have a laugh at a reference to a movie that scared the crap out of them. Where as with a movie like Date Movie they are already parodying comedies. So most people will think Scary Movie 5 is absolute junk, and I would agree with them. But I did have a good time watching it! Turn your brain of and rent this one out on DVD in a few months.\n\n2.5/5",

References aren't jokes, and scenes lifted from other movies and played somewhat satirically doesn't make a good spoof.

Scary Movie 5 is similar to the third, and fourth films in the series, that being \"not funny\", and \"at the least bit appealing\". It reminds me a horror film of my own.  A sane person sits through the entire movie, flinching, unaware, but also pretty sure, of what joke they were going to throw in next, and cringing at the failed attempts. His head explodes from the embarrasment that he spent money on this. Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash try to give their best to replace the bubbly, and quirky Anna Faris, and the beautiful, funny Regina Hall as the film's heterosexual life partners, but their friendship has little to no chemistry. Most of the humor is drawn from racist remarks, slapstick, crude, and I meant very crude, humor, and parodies of horror films, such as Paranormal Activity, Mama, and Black Swan.

Honestly, this feels like one of those crappy independent films that comes in eight movie packs at K-Mart. Sure, there are a bunch of cameos to set it apart from the other imitators, but it feels nothing like the previous movies in the franchise. First problem: It isn't funny. I think I laughed a total of two times in the whole movie. Second problem: It feels rushed. It seems as if every scene is set up only for the punchline, which is rarely funny. Like that stupid toilet in the closet gag. What was up with that? Third problem: The film reeks of laziness. It literally feels as if half of the scenes in this film were shot weeks before the release, just to make it feel fresh and new. Honestly, how else would they have parodied Evil Dead if it was released in theaters a week before this was released? Overall, this is a new low, even for the long list of parody movies put out by these guys. Surprisingly, the parody Mama is scarier than the CGI one from the actual film!",

            "content": "Let's do the bottom line first:  parody films are the scourge of the film world.  The comedy parody is the cheapest, most worthless form of entertainment in all of film.  Quite simply, they give movie-making a bad name and simply try to cash in the success of other films.  Now, this particular response is mainly due in large part to the abysmal, horrendous parody films in recent memory  - including, but not limited to Movie 43, The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It, and A Haunted House.  Now, that's not to say all parody films are bad.  On the contrary, that are are select few parody films that a classics - including Spaceballs, Hot Shots!, The Naked Gun, and Scary Movie.  Does the original Scary Movie film belong in that club?  The honest answer is probably not yet (give it more time to appreciate in value), however, if you compared the massively successful Scary Movie to newest sequel in the series, Scary Movie 5, you'll see exactly how far the franchise has fallen in terms of quality.\n\nTypically, this is where the synopsis for the film enters the review - but when you're dealing with a parody film, there's absolutely no plot to be had.  From beginning to end, Scary Movie 5 mainly attempts to follow the Paranormal Activity plot-line where there is an evil presence in a \"normal\" suburban home and the residents try to videotape the evil inhabitants.  However, Scary Movie constantly veers off course to mock various other films, including Black Swan, Evil Dead, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Inception.  Although this film is technically a sequel, previous main cast members Anna Faris and Brenda Meeks exit the franchise and make way for Ashley Tisdale and Erica Ash.  However, Charlie Sheen (briefly) and Molly Shannon both return after stints in previous sequels.\n\nThere's really no other way to say this:  Scary Movie 5 is not funny.  For a film to be labeled a comedy, one would assume there's laughing involved.  Easily the worst in the series, Scary Movie 5 completely misses the mark, often trying too hard to create something out of nothing.  If you saw the trailer and thought there might be some hope for the film, you're not alone.  The problem is Scary Movie 5 is one of those films that used all of its best moments in the trailer - including the brief appearance by Charlie Sheen and Lindsey Lohan, both of whom are only in the opening scene and were obviously brought in to tastelessly dupe people into falsely buying tickets for the movie.  Not only were they strictly in the opening scene, but there is absolutely nothing to take away from that scene, other than the sad state of their personal lives.  Sheen shows off his sex tape collection, while Lohan goes on and on about her court date the following morning.  It's a completely lackluster and disappointing interaction between the two, especially since the general public is already mostly aware of their constant battles with the legal system - and virtually don't care anymore.\n\nIt's often hard to find a silver lining in a parody film, but if one exists in Scary Movie 5, it has to be the acting of Ashley Tisdale.  Surprisingly, she plays her part well - even if she is less effective than the absent Anna Faris.  It was announced relatively early that Faris would not be returning to the franchise (and who can blame her), but Scary Movie 5 was obviously written with the assumption that the Faris/Meeks tandem would be reprising their roles.  For the diehard Scary Movie fans (assuming they exist somewhere), it's a pretty devastating blow to be without Anna Faris, the face of the franchise, for the first time - yet, Scary Movie 5 almost feels like a parody of a parody with Tisdale/Ash doing their best Faris/Meeks impressions.\n\nOccasionally, there are brief moments of sunlight in this monumentally dull film.  In one particular scene, the main lead - Ashley Tisdale treats her cell phone as a means to discover whether or not she's pregnant by using an \"I-Preggers App\" - which she urinates on, and then immediately answers an incoming call.  While the scene isn't overly amusing, it does serve its purpose to make fun of the way society relies on smartphones to give us the majority of our information.  Oddly enough, Scary Movie 5 has far too many of these smart moments and not enough laugh-out-loud funny moments, with the majority of its cracks being either too dimwitted or too intelligent for their own good.  Either way, the film suffers greatly due its complacency.\n\nOverall, the Scary Movie franchise continues to struggle without the Wayans brothers - and even more so due to the restriction of a PG-13 rating, which the franchise adopted for Scary Movie 3 and beyond.  The film is filled with an endless amount of sex, drug, and celebrity references, and even though the film was able to attain a PG-13 rating, it's still unsuitable for kids and simply mind-baffling how a film of this nature wasn't given an R-rating.  Do yourself a favor and skip this film at all cost - and if you have kids, make sure they skip it, too.\n\nOverall Film Grade:   D-",

            "content": "I could just say, \"It was bad; don't go see it.\" But that would be too short and would not give any weight to my opinion. Why was it bad? You could tell that it had been a while since a Scary Movie had been made. Even though the majority of the film is a parody of Mama, with a little Evil Dead thrown in there, they were still making references to Black Swan and Inception. It's like someone had been sitting on this material and was waiting for a larger frame to arrive so they could throw in these smaller plot line parodies. Then there was the initial scene with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan - again, not exactly recent material, but the 2 actors allowed themselves to be made fun of, so kudos to them. Unfortunately, that was probably the best material in the whole movie. I was sure that they killed Charlie Sheen off in Scary Movie 4, but I guess continuity is not a strong point for this series. Nor is a coherent plot line.  I suppose Anna Faris finally got some standards, or maybe she got too old, because she was noticeably lacking in this film (even after being the only one to appear in each of the first four). Enter Ashley Tisdale, which is a shame, because I'll always see her as Sharpay. For her, this is a role that screams, \"Hey! I'm still willing to be paid to be in a movie!\" As for Simon Rex, he gets hit a lot in this movie. And I think he deserves it. I will admit to laughing out loud, though, when he bangs a certain part of his anatomy against a couple of objects in the middle of the night. Aside from these two, Snoop Dogg is funny, though there was one point where I was asking myself, \"Why are they continuing with this joke? Didn't this get old after the 10th time?\" I hesitate to admit that I've seen each of the Scary Movies, and Scary Movie 3 was the best of this franchise. This is a poor sequel to it, and that's saying something. You will laugh during this movie, for sure. Just make sure not to have any expectations at all, and check your brain at the door.",

Many of it's gags out stay their welcome and the repetition gets exhausting, and although it never reaches the heights of hilarity seen in the third and fourth movies, Scary Movie 5 is still very entertaining and completely absurd. The best news is that Ashley Tisdale fills in the shoes of Anna Faris very well, although I do miss Anna Faris and Regina Hall. The opening had me laughing lewdly immediately, where Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan rip the crap out of their own personal lives and problems all for comedy, also throwing in a spoof of the first Paranormal Activity movie. The best aspect of this movie has to be the spoofing of Black Swan, which is spectacularly ripped by David Zucker, the impression of Natalie Portman's, Vincent Cassel's and Winona Ryder's characters just hit the spot so well. Inception, Sinister, Mama and the new Evil Dead are thrown in for good measure, delivering some great moments from new movies only with a whole lot of randomness added in. Paranormal Activity is totally made fun of, I love the \"front door open\" gag and \"The cabin in the Woods\" gag at the end where Modern Family's Sarah Hyland and 30 Rock's Katrina Bowden are possessed with some really bloody results, and the use of breaking the fourth wall is so funny, throughout the movie. If you are a fan of the franchise then definitely go and see this, it's still delivers the madness and stupidity of the previous 4, and Ashley Tisdale is brilliantly funny.",

            "content": "It's been 7 years since Scary Movie 4 hit theaters to a pretty impressive box office run, and Scary Movie 5 brings the series back in a big fun way. If you loved the other four films (especially part 3) you will definitely get a kick out of Scary Movie 5. This is a spoof done right, written by David Zucker, the master of slapstick humor. Sure, like any spoof movie there are tons and tons of jokes and some miss the mark. However, Scary Movie 5 succeeds by sticking to its roots and rebooting the entire series for new audiences and old fans alike.\n\nThe first thing you will probably notice is the rather unfortunate and upsetting lack of Anna Farris. Farris rose to stardom almost exclusively through the Scary Movie films at first, building her comedic repertoire along the way. At the time of filming, Farris was pregnant, so Ashley Tisdale fills Anna's shoes in a surprisingly fulfilling turn. Sure, she's no Cindy Campbell, but Jody is a character you can root for and Tisdale really does prove she has good comic timing. Unfortunately, there is also no Brenda (Regina Hall) or any of the other great characters to be found in the other sequels. For this film, it actually works this circumstance to its advantage, bringing back both Charlie Sheen and Simon Rex as relatives (again) but playing completely different character than their counterparts from the third and fourth installments. Some of the side characters bring the most laughs, from Molly Shannon as Heather to Tyler Posey as a hardcore Christian chilling at a cabin in the woods (long story.) The opening scene rivals the best ones in this series, and the scene fully concludes after the credits roll so stick around for a fun moment and obvious ode to the other four movies. Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen were absolutely perfect choices for the opening and I really missed them once they were gone. Also, I could watch Simon Rex do his awkward comedy schtick for hours and never get bored. Rock on, Dirt Nasty!\n\nThere are some really nitpicky issues to be found within this feature, but when you are watching a spoof film you really need to switch your brain off to have any fun. There are some odd dubbing issues as far as sound goes where it looks like the actor was saying something else, which most likely was a product of the numerous reshoots this movie underwent to remain more relevant. The Inception and 50 Shades of Grey spoofs kind of fall flat on their faces and bring the movie to a bit of a halt, but they are mere bumps in the road compared to the laughs to be found in the rest of the movie. I'm anxious to see an unrated version of this on DVD to see what was cut out or what footage/spoofs were excised completely from the final product.\n\nIf spoofs are your thing, there is plenty of hysterical moments to be found within Scary Movie 5, which actually takes chances and doesn't rehash the same material over and over again. This isn't your typical throwaway spoof. Though the ending could have used a bit of polishing (come to think of it, I've never been fully satisfied with an ending apart from the first), the final product is very watchable and has some decidedly off-the-wall moments. I can honestly say I loved Scary Movie 5, and if you're a fan of spoofs you will probably love it too.",

The script sounds like it was written by a 13 year old boy in 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nSecond, the acting was really bad in this one,  and I know the previous Scary Movies had bad acting, but this, this was dreadful. I was let down because it had about a second of Snoop Dogg (Lion) and Charlie Sheen, who I was looking forward to.\r\n\r\nAnd last of all, they barely spoofed half of the films they said they would. For example: Evil Dead, only at the start and about 5 minutes in the middle. Inception only for 5 minutes and it was complete and utter crap. They really only spoofed Mama and they could have spoofed a more interesting film (nothing against Mama, I'm just saying it was crap the way the spoofed it.)\r\n\r\nSo overall, I thought it was okay but the weakest entry in the franchise. Some of the gags were funny but most were hit an miss and acting is very bad, but I'm not sure if they were trying or were told to act awful.",

The first one wasn't excellent, but it was pretty funny and while I had problems with the second and third films, they were pretty good. Scary Movie 4, however, was lackluster despite a few decent gags here and there. So, when the makers of the franchise decided to make another Scary Movie, I became interested and went to see it today with my brother.\r\n\r\nLater, we walked out of the theater. My brother didn't like it, but coming across as a movie-buff guy, I kind of liked it. Ok, it does have some problems that I would point out in a moment, but while it's not as funny as the original film, it's a lot better than Scary Movie 4. So, here are the flaws.\r\n\r\nThe story did focus on a few horror films and such, but it came across as nonsensical with a pointless 10 minute opening sequence and it has several scenes that are completely dragged throughout the movie. The pacing is a tad uneven and the characters are beyond dull.\r\n\r\nThere are some redeeming qualities, however. The acting isn't anything special, but I think that despite Anna Faris and Regina Hall from the previous films not returning, I think Ashley Tidsdale and several actors including cameos from Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan handled the material really well. The scenery and the sets are pretty cool too, but the best part would have to go to the gags and while they're not as funny as the original's gags, most of them got me laughing.\r\n\r\nI understand that this movie is getting panned by critics, but being a guy who likes comedy films, I think this is a guilty pleasure for me. I'm sure fans of the Scary Movie franchise might hate it, but I think there might be some other people who might like it depending on their own tastes.",

When I heard about Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan of all people bringing back Scary Movie to its roots, things were well.... pretty weird and I saw the movie. Two words: IT SUCKS. With all do respect, I still love the Scary Movie films (all 4 of them), but who needs the Wayans Bros. when you need them. I thought A Haunted House was one of the better films than Scary Movie V and I was right. I know both Sheen and Lohan were front-page news through the years, but their big comeback is a brutal mistake. I think it's time for a Scary Movie reboot because I don't care about spoof movies anymore when it comes to bad movies from the directors of Date Movie and all the crappier ones.

Unfortunately, \"Scary Movie 5\" lacks the charm, the wit and the cast that made the franchise so successful back in the days. The formula has clearly been worn out, as the movie frequently descends into the satirical territory of movies like \"Disaster Movie\", \"Epic Movie\" and \"Meet The Spartans\", which is in no way a compliment to the filmmakers. My main gripe with \"Scary Movie 5\" is that it feels very disjointed and incoherent, even for a movie of its caliber. The storyline is so randomly/chaotically constructed with too many rapid nut-shots and excruciating jokes that never allow any of the movie's bright spots to seep into your conscience. In other words, the pacing is really off, and the movie ultimately falls to the ground because of that. It does have its hysterically funny moments, but those aren't enough to make up for the horrible performances, the terrible dialogue and the watered down spoofs. Even for a die-hard Scary Movie fan, this is embarrassing to watch. Stay away from it!!",

Scary Movie was such a laugh a minute, as was its sequel, but what has happened since then?! Answer: not a lot unfortunately. Admittedly this wasn't helped by the fact I hadn't seen a lot of the films it was spoofing, but maybe it's not a positive thing when they're belittling mediocre movies in the first place - Mama, Paranormal Activity, Sinister - I mean they're hardly the 90's slasher kings of Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer are they? Surely you're success is directly linked to its audience understanding the films its spoofing, but this was difficult. To me, the jokes were not particularly clever, just same old slapstick, with the odd cheesy rib tickler eventually shining through. It's a shame that none of the original cast has made it through to this stage, as it's lacking a real presence, notably Anna Faris and the Wayans Brothers. Ashley Tisdale is about the only famous face (other than cameos from Snoop Dogg, Usher, and Lindsay Lohan), and she fits in well, but on her own she can't carry the film. There are no real notable characters, nor did I feel that it was mocking a particular film well. I guess as long as they keep rolling out the horrors, they'll be a demand for this franchise to continue, but on this basis, and bearing in mind the quality of the last instalment, it's time to call it quits whilst the name still has some credibility.",

However, there are some things I would like to point out about this film. First of all, the actors did a decent job with the right context and how the characters responded to the situations was overall funny. Second, What really woke me up was the appearance of Medea from Tyler Perry's hit film. Okay, this is the last part of what I thought was somewhat funny about this movie; the scene regarding the maid in paranormal bringing out a life sized christian cross out of no where. The bottom line, a decent comedy flick teasing a few notable horror flicks and some special appearances of characters from other films.",

On the poster they had Ted, he was absolutely nowhere in the movie! Also Mike Tyson never wears that outfit and was in the movie for most 15 seconds. The story was extremely bad with pop culture references that didn't make sense popping up all over the place. The movie itself was fairly funny. There were a few good jokes and scenes but mostly the movie was out of place. The cheap budget made the special effects hard to look at and you even felt dizzy when you did. Also the film was marketed falsely. Half the scenes in the trailers and posters were not included in the film which really made me upset because to me, those scenes were funny. The writing really should have been better being helmed by David Zucker, director of the later of the Scary Movie franchise and Airplane! and even The Naked Gun trilogy. I never would've thought that a Scary Movie could be that bad. I mean seriously, look at the tomatometer. Only 2 positive reviews. Plus some of the \"parodies\" were only used for a few minutes. The honey boo boo scene made absolutely no sense because that was the only scene, and for no reason. I don't know what the f**k got cut out to make it the bulls**t PG-13 rating but obviously it was all the good parts. I hope there will be an extended cut on Bluray because frankly, this film put the Scary Movie saga in a bad light. I preferred A Haunted House!",

I must say, though, it does have a few good laughs. Frankly, most of the best jokes are the smaller, more underplayed gags, such as Charlie Sheen calling his cat Emilio, or a scene in which Simon Rex's character just keeps getting increasingly more awkward when talking to his black boss about how the apes are just like us. It clearly suffers from the numerous rewrites it went through in order to keep it as up-to-date as possible. I would've loved to see it in its original conception as being more centered around 'Black Swan' and 'Paranormal Activity'. After seeing 'Mama', I thought of many other ways in which it could have been spoofed that, in my opinion, would have been funnier and made more sense. This whole movie just seems thrown together at the last minute, despite being worked on and rewritten for years. Overall, it has some very funny moments, but as a whole, it just doesn't work very well.",

It is so awful that I literally felt like I was watching an amateur YouTube video I made when I was 10. The jokes are either stale, awkward, or just plain dumb. They constantly repeat slapstick comedy & the scenes are edited together very awfully. The first scene with Lindsay & Charlie is a huge miss, and Tisdale does not have the comedy chops to make this awful movie work one bit. There's a few moments that I did laugh because it was so awful & there's a funny scene with Morgan Freeman narrating, but other than that, it does not make fun of the horror movies (the very few ones it does feature) and instead just uses them as a setting for dumb jokes. At least the old movies used the actual movies as jokes. It's sad because there really is potential for funny jokes when it comes to making fun of horror movies every couple years.",

            "content": "Scary Movie 5 is the definition of what can go wrong with a movie, and my goodness does a lot of things goes wrong in this movie.  First of all the film insists on continuing a franchise of spoof film by putting in a few cameos, giving us some disturbing jokes, and never once even attempting to be a decent comedy like the original film was.  I must admit that I have never been a fan of the Scary Movie series, besides the first one I found them all to be too ridiculous and pathetic to be considered real entertainment.  The writers seem to only want to offend and annoy people which are what they surely succeed once again with this entry.  The first film had originality, used silliness to its advantage, and mixed in a good level of horror movie spoof without going off the rails.  This film mixes in spoofs from not just horror movies, but films like \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\" to \"Inception\" and it just never made me laugh, only cringe.  I think most people know the routine of these films by know, but to make matters worse they switch out Anna Faris with Ashley Tisdale in the starring role, and I respect Faris for this because she must have saw the script and said \"No, this is too bad, even for me.\" The trailer makes it seem as if Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan are the stars of the film, but really they are in the first few minutes of the film and have had their quick cameo.  There were just so many things that go wrong in this film, whether it was the story, cast, jokes, or directing, that I cannot willingly tell anyone to see this movie unless you love seeing your money flushed down the toilet.\n  \n\n  The story follows a group of people who believe that they are being haunted, and the following events just keep getting crazier and crazier.\n\nThe plot doesn't really exist, and as you can see from the story description above it was very difficult explaining what the story even came close attempting.  I am not sure if the writers were trying to revive the series, but I haven't seen such a waste of time at the movies in a while.  There have been movies I have disliked, but this film just seems like it took a few hours to make and they didn't attempt at all to make it funny.  It just proves that if you slap a franchise name like \"Scary Movie\" on a poster people will pay to see it, even if they know it will be bad.  I won't bother talking about the characters, and I don't mind this because it's just a group of the most boring, bland, stupid characters I have seen in a film for quite some time.  I think this is a film aimed for Middle School students who still believe that \"The Benchwarmers\" is pure comedic genius and brilliant filmmaking, and I still think even they will find this film atrocious.  I don't wish to go on further with talking about this plot; it will make me angrier that I paid to see this trash.\n\n  The cast brings back a lot of actors that I wished to never see on film again, and man they just love to screw with their own careers.  Ashley Tisdale lives up to her expectations, and her expectations were so low that it can't even been describes.  She is just Ashley Tisdale, which is the only way to describe her.  Simon Rex is the only one that even attempts to bring some laughs, but thanks to this God awful script he can't be recognized.  Erica Ash returns to the series, and as it can tell she has really hit a low in her career if this is the only job she can get.  You have cameos from Charlie Sheen, Bow Wow, Snoop Dog, Mike Tyson, Mac Miller, Big Ang, and many actors that just seem to want nothing more than to look like fools.  I am sorry but they just act like any other actors in a David Zucker film, dumb.\n\n  Scary Movie 5 makes every attempt to be as bad as possible, and I just couldn't learn to love the stupidity like so many others could.  I still remember when I watched \"Meet the Spartans\" a few years ago, as I believed it would be a stupid brand of comedy which I enjoy (if done correctly) so I watched it.  I could not believe what I was seeing; this trash was actually filmed and put into theaters.  This is the point in my life when I realized that I actually have my limits when it comes to watching crap movies.  The point of this story is to show that films like Scary Movie 5 are the reason that I review movies in the first place, because I want to voice my opinion on how bad some movies can be and how some people are ignorant enough to consider it great.  If you really enjoyed this film, that is your own opinion and you are entitled to it, but I must please ask to reconsider and realize this to be the crap it truly is.  This film has no laughs, no happiness, and finds every possible chance it can get to throw in a spoof and try and ruin a great film.  I am not a fan of the Scary Movie series, and I will pray that this is the last I have to hear about them.",

And with that being said I'll say that the latest entry is the best the franchise has been since the second film for better or worse. As the film opens Lindsay Lohan and Charlie Sheen are in a bed ready to get it on as they spoof their various life choices cleverly for the most part. But as they are murdered by a sinister force their three children go missing. Months later they are found in the woods \"Mama\" style by a couple of stoners (Snoop Dogg) and returned to their Uncle (sexy Simon Rex) and his new wife (a perfectly vacuos Ashley Tisdale). Moving things along a spirit haunts their house, they have a super religious hispanic maid, Tisdale rediscovers her love for the ballet with a jealous new lesbian understudy and they go ins earch for an evil book that they changed the ghost into what she is.

            "content": "Judging from the 3.7 stars grade here on IMDb, people didn't like this movie too much. This surprised me, since my guess would be that most users, especially those that go on the page of this movie, are probably under 30. I guess these people just don't understand or get the humor.\n\n3.7 is way too low for this movie.\n\nThe fifth installment of the Scary Movie series starts of with Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan in bed, spoofing Paranormal Activity. \n\nAfter that, Scary MoVie, just like the previous movies, spoofs other movies. \n\nMovies that get spoofed are Mama, Paranormal Activity, The Cabin in the Woods, Black Swan and The Rise of the Apes.\n\nAfter the first scene, we get to follow Mac Miller and Snoop Dogg walking through a forest, looking for a place that grows \"the best marijuana\". They are gonna go there, and leave. They are later seen running with a huge joint, that both are carrying. They then find a cabin, and a slightly tiresome dialog breaks out between Mac and Snoop, in which Snoop doesn't know what movie Mac is talking about when they are looking at a \"Cabin in the Woods\". They enter the house, and they find two girls, like in Mama where two little kids are found in a cabin in the woods.\n\nSimon Rex and Ashley Tisdale portrays the parent characters of the horror movie Mama in Scary Movie 5. I personally am not a huge fan of Simon Rex's in this movie, as I think his humor and acting is a little bit too immature or whatever.\n\nThere are also a lot of guest stars in this movie, for example Lindsay Lohan as mentioned before, along with Snoop Dogg, Mac Miller, Usher, Katt Williams, Madea, Lil Duval, Sarah Hyland, Bow Wow and more. They make the movie a lot better, as it gives the movie variation and other positive things.\n\nI can't remember the last time I laughed as much as I did during the scene where Sarah Hyland and Bow Wow along with two other actors, gets possessed (or something like that) while they are portraying the characters of the movie \"The Cabin in the Woods\", obviously in a cabin in the woods. \n\nWhen it all comes down, I think Scary MoVie was one of the best ones so far in the series. If you've enjoyed the previous Scary Movie titles, you will most likely love this one. It gets kind of slow at times, and I personally didn't like the gorilla scenes too much. All the funny scenes made up for that though. There is no 6.5 star grade, but that's what I give it.",

Let me start off by saying that I knew this film was going to be horrible from the start. I had read reviews and knew it was bad, but being so infatuated with film and theater, I actually wanted to see the movie to diagnose exactly what made it so horrible. Admittedly, there were some very rare parts of the movie that had a somewhat witty humor to it, but it was only once or twice, and weak at that. The rest of the stupid slapstick humor was just so lame and dragging. Overall, there was almost no sophisticated or witty humor, horrid acting, and it was all just plain bad. So yes, the reviews are correct, it was horrible. Don't waste your time!\n\nHappily-married couple Dan and Jody begin to notice some bizarre activity once they bring their newborn baby Aiden home from the hospital. But when the chaos expands into Jody's job as a ballet dancer and Dan's career as an Ape researcher, they realize their family is being stalked by a nefarious demon. Together, with the advice of certified experts and the aid of numerous cameras, they must figure out how to get rid of it before it's too late.",

From there, the film parodies the biggest blockbusters of the last few years, but does so without a semblance of relevance, creativity or wit.\n\nIt says a lot about the film that the only half-laughs to be had come from Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan sharing the opening scene - an incredibly stupid and borderline cringe-worthy, but inexplicably entertaining chuckle at their fall from grace.\n\nIt's all downhill from there as the rest of the film plays out as a series of unconnected set pieces seen literally hundreds of times before. Often, such an unappealing movie is still able to salvage hope by suiting itself for a target market, but it is hard to see any audience group, from 15 year old to stoner, defending this abomination.\n\nOne would have to drink Lindsay under the table, smoke copious amounts of bud with Snoop Dogg and/or Lion and snort pure tiger blood with Charlie to even come close to drawing any semblance of enjoyment from this disaster. An imminent sweep of this year's Razzies doesn't seem like ironic punishment enough for one of the worst films ever made.",
