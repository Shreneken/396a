    "summary": "Although his life is already in a downward spiral, things get much worse for advertising executive Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) ; while drunk one night, Joe is kidnapped and thrown into solitary confinement in a bizarre, hotellike room. For the next 20 years, Joe suffers unimaginable torment, but the motive and identity of his captor remain unknown. When he is inexplicably set free, Joe emerges with one goal: to find the person who stole two decades of his life.",

Where is the profit for holding people hostage for decades.  Sure Chaney said the fee is high but how much of the profit is eaten by feeding him, even if barely to keep him alive.  Plus no spoilers but for the plan to work it takes a lot of confident set of circumstances to happen.  If you've seen either version you'll know what I'm talking about.  Too much is up to chance for the plot to work is what I'm saying.  Plus before Joe gets abducted they show him is a massive asshole who almost deserves what he gets.  The pacing is all over the place.  But I got to admit that there are exactly two points of interest but not enough to save it.",

It's the same story as the original, but with incest being a major plot point, for whatever reason. But I honestly really liked this movie. The acting is good, maybe apart from some scenes with Sharlto Copley, where he overacts a bit.

With a sentiment like that especially after having seen him of some more successful works, I decided to check out this movie. I learned pretty quickly that this was a remake of a Korean film and that Spike Lee had decided to do it. I learned a little about that movie and then I watched this movie.\n\nSet twenty years ago to present day, a selfish, drunken advertising executive endures a normal twisted day when he wakes up in a locked hotel room with a television, from there he learns that he's been confined in a type of underground prison and forced to eat and drink what he's been given. Learning that he's been put in this situation by someone who wants him to live knowing that he's been framed for the murder of his ex-wife and forced to spend the rest of his days locked up.\n\nEver since then he has been doing everything in his power to change himself as well as found out the truth as to who put him in the prison. But unexpectedly he wakes up in the middle of a field and from that point he begins his journey, catching up with old friends and seeking out the truth.\n\nBrolin delivers an amazing performance as a man who goes from a selfish jerk to a prisoner to free. In a role that is very much a modern-day Oedipus Rex. Plenty of other great performers in this story as well but it is Brolin's story. I understand that this movie was set to be longer but the studio decided against it. I'd want to watch that to see more of Brolin's great performance.",

Sadly, as much as I love Sharlto Copley, his acting is pretty unintentionally cheesy here. Still a great film. Cinematography, cast, dark humor, and brutal action are on-point here.

Then once it gets going everything feels so jarring and over the top. Though I think the remake did better in fleshing out the kidnapping scenes but the original accomplished the same in half the time and added much more to the movie. And even with the hotel scenes, I think they’re much more confusing in the remake. The original was much slower but felt very original and surreal in how it continued the story. And with the added plot points and ideas, none feel very impactful while the ideas that they could’ve expanded on they did nothing with.

So I wonder what the point in this remake is. \nSamuel L Jackson's character should be taken by a lesser known actor. His star power is a distraction.

Besides, you now have this review to tell you all about it. Who could ask for anything more? Well, a winning Powerball ticket would be nice, but failing that, I have a very twisty and twisted movie to review for you.\n\nJosh Brolin is Joe Doucette, an ad man and a seemingly irredeemable schmuck. His wife calls him a joke of a husband and father, actually a fairly kind assessment of his character. After blowing off his daughter's birthday for work and then going on a bender, he wakes up in a strange room made to look like a hotel room, but with no windows and a locked door with a small hatch that only opens when a plate of food is slid into the room. And so Joe stays in this room - for 20 years! All there is for him to do is work out, watch TV and try to figure out why he's there and who put him there. Given his personal history, there are many potential culprits on the list. He actually does make a list and checks it - more than twice. When he's released as suddenly and inexplicably as he was imprisoned, he sets out to find his daughter and get revenge on the person responsible for his kidnapping, even as that person, via cell phone, taunts and threatens him. Along the way, he gets help from an old friend (Michael Imperioli) and a do-gooder nurse (Elizabeth Olsen). \n\n\"Oldman\" is fascinating in its execution, revealing its many secrets over the course of the movie. When the reveals pick up speed towards the end, there are jaw-dropping surprises that will make your head spin. I thought the violence was a little over the top and didn't play as well as Lee obviously thought it would, but this is a very clever and very shocking movie, which is mostly VERY well-done. \"A-\"",

His constant drinking has gotten him into frequent trouble at work, and one day his ex-wife Donna berates him for missing his daughter, Mia's, 3rd birthday, which he brushes off. Later that night, he ruins a meeting with a highly potential client, Daniel Newcombe (Lance Reddick), by hitting on his girlfriend. Knowing that he will likely be fired for his failure, Joe gets drunk, and goes to a bar owned by his friend Chucky (Michael Imperioli), who refuses him entry. While stuck outside, he spots a woman with a yellow umbrella, before passing out. He awakens in an isolated, locked hotel room, and finds that he is being held prisoner. His captors provide him with basic hygiene items and meager portions of processed Chinese food, along with a pint of vodka with every meal to prevent withdrawal, but do not provide reason for his imprisonment. Through a news bulletin on the TV in the room, Joe learns that Donna has been brutally raped and murdered, and he is the prime suspect. He also learns that Mia has been adopted. After being prevented from committing suicide, Joe starts writing Mia letters, gives up drinking, and spends the next 20 years planning his revenge. He gets in shape, becomes a skilled boxer by watching televised matches, and compiles a list of everyone who might be responsible for his imprisonment, with Newcombe being the prime suspect. In 2013, Joe watches an adult Mia being interviewed by a TV show called Unresolved Mysteries of Crime, and claiming she could try to forgive him if he returns. Suddenly, he is drugged and awakes in a box in a field, with money and a cell phone. He spots the woman with the yellow umbrella, whom he chases to a nearby clinic; there he meets Marie Sebastian (Elizabeth Olsen), a nurse who offers to help him. Joe refuses help but takes her card. He later visits Chucky and tells him what happened. He suddenly receives a mocking phone call from the mastermind behind his imprisonment, The Stranger (Sharlto Copley). Joe finds himself still trapped in a web of conspiracy and torment despite his release...\n\n\"Oldboy\" is a 2013 American remake by Spike Lee of Park Chan-wook's 2003 South Korean cult film, which is based on the Japanese manga with the same name, published 1996-98. Spike Lee said that his version was 140 minute long (mostly character build-ups and interactions), but the studio heavily edited his film to 105 minutes. It received a mixed reception from both critics and audiences, with praise towards the acting and visual style, but criticism for the comparisons to the original and adding nothing new to the film. The film was a box office bomb, being one of Lee's worst-performing films of his directing career. I did pass on \"Oldboy\" the original when it came out, party because I´m not really that into asian cinema and I reckon I felt a tiredness towards the graphic violence in it. I took however the decision to see what Spike Lee had done with his version and maybe that would spark an interest to see the original. I like the storyline and during the screentime it wasn´t certain where the film would go, and that is something I like as well. But, from what I understand this is as well just a simple rehash of the plot from the original film, but it quickly rushes through the unique storyline unable to establish an emotional connection with the audience. It´s hard to compare the two versions as I haven't´s seen the original, but I do however think that the remake feels lost in the original and it can´t stand on it´s own legs which creates a movie that is unstable and not its own entity despite the rather \"unique\" plot. And felt it was a bit too cartoony in it´s setup. And even if Brolin seems to have given everything he´s got in the title role, he still doesn´t fully convince me at least. The one who does convince is the lovely Elizabeth Olsen as Marie. She adds female emotional warmth and beauty to the script. She is for sure a new favourite of mine after this movie. Spike Lee´s \"Oldboy\" is ok, but I will hold on to more of my thoughts until I have seen Park Chan-wook's original.",

I also enjoyed the unrealistic ability of which Josh Brolin can kick ass. However, if there's already a masterpiece, why remake it? My rating would probably be lower here when I watch where the original came from. Til then, I see this film as a bit of a  GUILTY (you'll understand this pun later) pleasure.",

First timers would definitely be freaked out with the plot twist yet i do still recommend to watch the original Oldboy film.

Unfortunately, like those efforts, this movie also fails to balance those approaches adequately. It just doesn't work. The graphic action violence is clumsy at times, the main villain is too goofy to be taken seriously, and the female lead is clumsily dropped into the protagonists' life (the climax of the film seemingly explains this last one, but not to my liking). Speaking of the climax, this has got to be one of the most absurd, contrived endings ever to grace the silver screen. \n\nThe positive? I generally like Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen, and the rest of the cast okay. I'm not sure that the acting, cinematography, or even direction is the problem here. Lee should do more to improve the muddled tone and action bits, but ultimately, he does shoot the thing competently. No, the writing is most certainly the achilles heel. As the story really unwinds, it ultimately falls apart. As a mystery/thriller, however, it's really not that bad...during the first third.",

From the beginning, Josh Brolin's character was an unlikeable person and I never once felt emotionally attached to him as a character and that was another problem the movie had. Despite some good things in this remake, pointless and unnecessary were the main words I was thinking of when watching this rehash of a film. If only the filmmakers would have thought of better ideas and given us more different plot elements, this would have been a more competent remake and I would never have felt like I wasted 1 hr and 40 min watching a retelling of everything I already watched from the original Korean version that was more deep than this one and actually had original storytelling in it. The only positives I personally found with this remake is that I thought that Elizabeth Olsen, and Sharlto Copley gave solid performances, Josh Brolin's acting got better as the film went on, and I thought some of the different story elements did work and they were thoughtful even though most of the film is copying off the original in every way  In the end, if you want to watch an original concept be brought to life on film, do yourself a favor and watch the original and not this one.",

            "content": "Nothing is harder than watching a remake of a dear movie without bias or prejudice. With that said, Spike Lee's Oldboy a needless remake of Park Chan-wook's Oldboy; \"needless\" is used as the only valid reason for a 'remake' is when a movie is too obscure, didn't do well, or the original is too dated. Neither of which was the case for the original movie; it was just another Asian film that Hollywood felt a need to twist and remake for an English-speaking audience, by purging it of its Asian elements and injecting foreign elements into it to make it a contemporary Western flick. Part of what made the original great was how the film was very much an arthouse film. It was never intended to have been as successful as it went on to become, both in South Korea and in the international community. Spike Lee's remake however, was created with a clear goal of being a box office hit in Hollywood. Thus it is instantly confined to Hollywood's movie trappings and pitfalls.\n\nThere was one other American remake that - as someone from Asia - surpassed the original; Martin Scorsese's The Departed (2006), which was a remake of Alan Mak and Andrew Lau's Infernal Affairs (2002) from Hong Kong. The reason The Departed was just as good as the original was how Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan not only adapted the original film, but also gave his own spin to it; it wasn't merely a change in the cast and location. The end results were two intrinsically and culturally unique films. Spike Lee's remake of Park Chan-wook's Oldboy on the other hand is basically the same movie, and doesn't truly introduce anything new to the original or even set it apart from the original in a unique way. At best, Spike Lee's remake would be remembered as a decent artistic remake of the original. At worst, Spike Lee's remake will be treated as a malignant growth.\n\nJosh Brolin does a great job as the alcoholic jerk Joe Doucett, however this is only resigned to before he is imprisoned. After spending 20 years in isolation, one would expect Joe to be a crippling social outcast as the only interactions he has had are with several mice, a blood-stained pillow and the TV set in his room, but this just doesn't come across well after Joe is released, though this falls primarily on Spike Lee's direction and Mark Protosevich's adrenaline-fueled screenplay. On the other hand, Sharlto Copley gives a great hammed up performance as the cliché of a villain behind Joe's incarceration, but he doesn't receive as much development as he could have despite what little he receives towards the end, if it can be called 'development'. What he does receive is a half-naked Asian secretary that loves to touch his scars. Lucky Copley; the original villain's assistant was an old South Korean guy with bleached hair. Hollywood, right?\n\nThe movie itself moves at the frenetic pace of a child on a sugar high because Doucett is a man on a mission. A mission that doesn't allow him to catch a breather or be weighed down by a nude Elizabeth Olsen. She wants to help him. Why? Who knows. She just helps others, okay? Right; Doucett's mission. He needs to find who imprisoned him. Fast. He tries some dumplings. Hurriedly moving the filling around in his mouth, Doucett seems more like he's hoping to find a Golden Ticket to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Off he goes to another shop. Scenes pass and move on abruptly, never taking the time it and the audience needs to breathe in the story and atmosphere which are, ironically, rich. Spike Lee's remake is, simply put, a fast-paced action movie devoid of heart. On the flip side, it has plenty of overt references to the original. So, yay for you, Spike.

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nI didn't feel that the original Oldboy by Chan-wook Park was perfect, but it was a memorable ride. 10 years after the Korean release, an American adaptation was spawned, handled by director Spike Lee. Honestly, I did not mind the story being told again because the themes it covers are universal, only requiring minor tweaking to fit into the current generation, and also the film would have been a wonderful opportunity to maybe correct some of the personal doubts I had with the original. Sadly, this entry barely did anything to shake up those who have seen the original, creating minor changes and supported with dull direction that actually made the original seem better.\n\nThis film starts off slightly different from the original, spending a bit more time on the protagonist, and exposing more on why he is such an unlikeable fellow. What the original did right was that it immediately showed the character at his most lowest, instead of having supporting scenes to create a negative curve on the characterisation of the protagonist. The original allowed some mystery to be left with the character at the start and the slight comedic execution allowed a cushion to be felt, to be aware of the fact that the overall story itself is a bit ridiculous and extreme. In Spike Lee's interpretation, the character exposition felt much more forced, making it much harder to forgive and be more sympathetic towards his situation.\n\nThe character then becomes abducted and placed in a hotel-like room for 20 years, going through cycles of tray-ed meals and manipulations to his body and mind, undertaken by his captors. It was here, that the film started to slightly pick up; showing the process of how the character would eventually change in becoming the hateful machine that is thirsty for revenge; but in comparison to the original, this film laid very basic groundwork, not going the extra mile in manipulating the character. Shouldn't this character go through intense psychological and emotional suffering? And if Lee was aware of this and did for a fact try to convey this, it barely gets under the audiences skin. Lee barely brings any sort of tension, both internally and externally, letting it come off as flat and unsurprising. Though in saying this, Lee did not did an awful job with this aspect of the film, he simply did not try or was inspired enough to create something riveting and challenging.\n\nThen the film's driving complication sets its place; the protagonist desperately needing to find his captor and daughter in a short amount of time. It was here that the film would turn into an action-adventure film, like the original, but it was very rarely that I was left in a state of excitement or shock; montages of intense violence are found during this aspect of the film, but due to Lee's serious and darker tone, the impact of it all was much less, even the recreation of the remarkable hallway fight scene in the original barely left me engaged. I was also left disappointed with the reveal of the villain, with the character coming off as less treacherous and mysterious as the original. The rationale behind his decision to torture the protagonist was less effective due to its minor changes, it came off as melodramatic and unconvincing; the original film had heart in its twisted revenge, leaving a mark on its audience's minds. Then the film's conclusion was a dud, lacking any power that the original was able to bring, which was slightly ambiguous, leaving audiences with food for thought; in this Hollywood edition, it felt too safe, displaying an ending that would please the majority of its audience.\n\nThe performances in this film were not too bad, though I did want them to show more exaggerated emotion, just to stamp a personality on each of them. Here, all the characters felt too one-note, defined only by their agendas, lacking that quality that was found in the Korean original that made these characters so damn memorable.\n\nSpike Lee's Oldboy is not the complete travesty that many claim it to be, but it is a major disappointment, especially when one lets it stand side by side with the original. My experience with Spike Lee only resides in his 2006 film, Inside Man, which at the time left me thrilled and tense, simply wondering how it would all turn out. Here I barely cared for anything that happened, which would make this forgettable experience in the long run.",

Besides the acting, the cinematography was really good, and it was kept at a good pace overall.  The action is over the top but amusing a and easy to follow, and it has some very gory and bloody moments of torture.  It's a complex plot, that is dead and confusing into the very end, but it still has some loose ends.  Like why does the bad guys dead dad have an open sexual relationship with his two young teenage children?  And why do the bad guys in movies always go through all this damn work, (in this case 20 years of it) just to make the main character experience their pain for a  for a couple of days at most.  So ya a dark movie, with many grime moments, a sad and confusing ending, and plenty of gory moments that will make you grimace.  Deserves a better rating from critics and viewers.",

It's just bloody and shocking enough to entertain an average person, but not too much to seriously offend.\n\nFor anyone who HAS seen Park Chan-wook's 2003 original film, will most likely find nothing here to enjoy. Although it is still gory and violent, the remake is toned way down from the original, with the infamous twist bogged down by a happy ending that feels very out of place. The cast is talented as is director Spike Lee, but at the end of the day, this movie was only made to tone down the original film slightly and make it more marketable to North American audiences, so unless you've never seen the original film and are stubborn about movies with subtitles, go ahead and watch Spike Lee's Oldboy, you'll probably think it isn't half bad (because on it's own, it isn't really), but if you're in the mood something a bit darker and overall better, and can handle reading subtitles for two hours, go back and watch the 2003 original film because man, that is a good movie.",

I would've tried to think of it as its own, but it's the exact movie, there was changes here and there, but not enough to make me think that it's trying to have a different story on its own, which makes it predictable. Another problem is that Josh Brolin was already buff before he got captured, so why didn't they make him skinny or fat? Ok he's a little fat, but that was his stomach that was fat, and when he exercise for many years, only his stomach looks different, not the arms. Speaking of buff, the fight scene where he fights a lot of people, he does get hurt, but not to the point where I think he's going to die like in the original, it was like no one can stop him because they just stand there and just wait for a guy to come and attack him, one by one. The next problem is that when they let Joe go after many years, he does find the umbrella girl and chase after it which is fine, when he finds a home to place, the first thing he did was to look for the person that took him there. That's understandable, but, he should be looking for his daughter too, it's been many years and he hasn't think that he should find her? It made no sense to me. The acting is good, but it's not as good as the original, I was surprised the script or Spike Lee didn't let Sharlto Copley to go over the top in this movie, but kept calm, I wish they did however, it would at least give me some entertainment. I'll admit that it does kept the grimness of the original, but that's not enough to save this movie. Oldboy was a pointless remake that never should've been made, and Spike Lee didn't made any passion for this movie, just the violence.",

Remakes are okay, but some movies won't suit for recreation because of its masterpiece value, believing that won't come close for the second time. Just like Mona Lisa, Starry Night, Birth of Venus, The Last Supper and other arts, it should have left alone untouched. Like Japanese did, because it was their story after all. This American version was good, but very much commercialized with the fast pace approach kind of ruined. If I had not seen the original, probably I would have liked it. I knew the twist so I did not get the excitements in those parts. So those who are not familiar with the 2003 movie can definitely have a good time.\n\n     It was not a copycat from frame to frame, many things were altered in this movie. The most laughable was to see gangsters fighting with knives, hammers and bare-hand like the Korean style. What I know in American gangster theme is that they take a gun and bang bang. The first poster where Josh Brolin comes out of the large wooden box was kind of funny, gives the impression of a comedy movie. I liked Josh Brolin in 'Labor Day' and yet again he was not bad in this film except if you compare him with his counterpart from the Korean movie, Choi Min Shik. It is one of the best role he has ever played, sadly the movie was not recieved well due to many other reasons than him.",

            "content": "Based on an incredibly distinctive South Korean film and helmed by a talented star and director, Oldboy \n\nRemaking Oldboy is an incredibly bold move. Given that the original Oldboy (2003) is a film distinctive of its culture due to its grim method of tackling sadistic violence and extremely twisted themes. Never before have I seen an American remake of a South Korean film as it is territory no one has ever entered before, and since remakes are so rare in success this is perhaps a good thing. Interestingly enough it's African-American filmmaker Spike Lee tackling such an ambitious project. It's an unconventional outing for him as he traditionally makes low-budget films based around the struggles of African-Americans while Oldboy is a larger-budgeted production which seems to carry mainstream connotations. But since Spike Lee is a man passionate about maintaining cultural relevance as a filmmaker, I figured that he would have a sense of how to be respectful to Park Chan-wook's piece. \nOldboy is a film which loses much of its cinematic power before the film even begins. Given that the original Oldboy had such an unpredictable story with unforgettable twists, the shock value of that film would be impossible to remaster since most viewers would be too familiar with it the original to find any kind of strength in the story's impact. It takes newcomers to embrace the full effect of the film's intentions, but it still remains a remake nonetheless. Due to its production context, the remake of Oldboy becomes about the chase and not the catch. The chase can prove quite entertaining at times, but ultimately the catch does not justify it all.\nOldboy works puts a lot of work into characterization into protagonist Joseph \"Joe\" Doucett. Though it is fairly basic, the intro characterizes the protagonist as a standard asshole who is carelessly self-obsessive in every facet of his personal life. There is a big turnaround in the scene where we see him befriending a stray mouse, creating a throwback to Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's The Green Mile (1999). At first glance I considered this thinly-veiled in derivation, but soon enough it really struck an emotional chord with me. This scene provides a really sensitive side to Joe Doucett, showing him in such a desperate state of emotion that he shows the humanity he has denied the world for so long. After caring for the mouse until it gives birth only to find that the mouse is soon taken from him to be killed and served to him, we see him break down to an all new emotional low point. This is his most vulnerable point in the film, and perhaps the first time audiences will feel something for him. I certainly did, and so when he began to change his physical form and defy his alcoholism there was a lot of power behind his actions. Oldboy definitely knows how to make a protagonist worth rooting for.\nHowever, Spike Lee's Joe Doucett is a ultimately a sub-par replacement for Park Chan-wook's Oh-Dae Sue, primarily because Joe Doucett doesn't seem all that savage as he develops. We see the main gaining ambition and self-respect as well as humanity, but this isn't in tune with the original. Oh Dae-sue becomes consumed by his obsession with vengeance, devolving into an almost primitive beast before turning emotionally void. Spike Lee's vision spends too much time sympathizing with the protagonist to make him the raw product of anger that Park Chan-wook did, removing the emotional intensity from the material. Oldboy's efforts to characterize its protagonist ultimately humanize him too much, and this is the one film where this shouldn't be done. Since Oldboy lacks the iconic scene in which the protagonist eats a live octopus, his savagery is obviously far from being what it should. Since it is easier to sympathise with the protagonist than to be shocked with his transformation, he very much risks becoming a standardized Hollywood action hero. When the film reaches its most distinctive action scene, this is a prophecy which is ultimately fulfilled.\nOne scene that needs to be critiqued is Spike Lee's version of the most iconic scene from the original Oldboy: the Hallway fight scene. The original is a masterpiece of filmmaking; a product of remarkable choreography and stunning cinematography which is remarkably achieved over the course of a singular take. Spike Lee's version of this scene certainly comes with some badass choreography and a mostly-effective achievement of the single-take technique. Alas, it still finds ways to come up short. Recreating such a scene is an incredible undertaking, and Spike Lee aims to make his adaptation of it his own while still being true to the original. In the process, he creates too many distractions to embrace it all as natural. It starts with the context of the scene; the original Oldboy occured within a singular tight hallway where the size of the room lined up Oh Dae-su's enemies in front of each other to prevent them from all swarming him at once. Jou Doucett fights his enemies in a warehouse which is far more open, lacking the same feeling of confinement. The shot isn't untouched; it removes certain frames to make the action more effective rather than relying solely on the choreography as Park-Chan Wook did. And though Jou Doucett takes hits, he is physically impenetrable to them and has wood broken on him without any physical response on multiple occasions. Oh Dae-su was injured and knocked down multiple times, but he kept going even in a clearly weakened state. Park Chan-wook used a more emotionally rich musical score while Spike Lee's is an adrenaline-pumping one, neglecting any emotional heft solely for action value. And last of all, Park Chan-wook's shot was a smooth moving and clear one while Spike Lee's plays out behind a wire fence which blocks portions of the visual experience, particularly when the camera insists on moving alongside it. It was frustrating enough to watch the climactic boxing match in Undisputed (2002) from behind bars, but in a film which aims for a higher literary standard this is far less impressive. The hallway fight scene in Spike Lee's Oldboy has its entertaining merits, but succumbs to the same Hollywood conventions that weaken the protagonist as well as some general technical faults which seem unconsidered. \nAlso, writer Mark Protosevich's alterations of the original story comes to be too much of burden when the film concludes. In treatment of the iconic plot twist, Oldboy ruins its characterization of the central antagonist by making alterations. Adrian Doyle Price never had an incestuous relationship with his sister, rather she was sleeping with their father. Instead of getting vengeance for exposing a complicated brother-sister incest, it completely changes path with the implementation of a patriarchal incest. Adrian Doyle Price is not getting vengeance for having someone drive his sister to suicide, he is doing it because it drove his father insane and had him try to kill the entire family. Rather than responding to a complicated love affair, Adrian Doyle Price seems to be motivated by his family's honour more than a descent into his own madness. Considering that Park Chan-wook's version of the character displayed the full effect of what vengeful obsession can do to a character, the fact that Spike Lee's version has motivations which are far less personal than class-driven seems very much inappropriate. When this concludes without the use of the original self-bodily mutilation or the protagonist's willing to deny himself the truth, its sentimental conclusion ultimately plays it way too safe to live up to what Spike Lee intended to build towards. Oldboy has an inappropriately anticlimactic ending, lacking the ambiguity and brilliance of the original in lieu of a more conventional option. \nHow much of Oldboy is the fault of the screenplay or studio cuts is ambiguous, but I will certify my admiration for Spike Lee's work on the project. Even those who don't enjoy Oldboy should appreciate the visual style of the film through the way it manages to use strong cinematography. With a limited assortment of locations, Oldboy manages to capture a truly grim feeling with its monochromatic colour scheme that consistently maintains a shade of grey or dark blue to capture the bleak nature of Joe Doucett's world. And in its attempts to emphasize Joe Doucett's entire identity being confined to the angry limits of his mind, Oldboy makes use of a lot of intense close-up focus to elicit a somewhat claustrophobic feeling at the right moments while bringing natural colour out of its scenery at others. A key part of the imagery is the blood and gore in the film which is mediated to a far lesser extent than Park Chan-wook's vision, though it still makes enough of a grim impact to reflect the edgy ambitions of the film. And another strong thing Oldboy captures is a clear perspective of the protagonist's face so that Josh Brolin's performance does not go unrealized.\nJosh Brolin makes a solid protagonist in Oldboy. Though his celebrity status lacks the everyman nature supplied by Cho Min-sik in the original role, Josh Brolin is not an overly glamourized celebrity. He is a legitimate actor who has proven to tackle some edgy material on multiple occasions, and Spike Lee's Oldboy is a clear cut example of that. In portraying Joseph \"Joe\" Doucett, Josh Brolin develops the character at an appropriately progressive rate throughout the story. He starts by capturing him as an egotistical and self-obsessed man before breaking down his exterior to cling onto the remains of his humanity. From there he builds himself up again until he shines with a remorseless iron edge; a fearsome demeanour that is driven by pure resentment and desire for retribution. The material leaves him to border on the edge of being a generic action hero at times, but the fact that Josh Brolin ensures that Joseph Doucett finds pleasure in exacting violence against his enemies empowers it above this. The screenplay for Oldboy messes with the character that Joe Doucett really should have become, but Josh Brolin's firm dedication offers an empowering performance which boasts his strength in conducting his character's emotions and an extremely impressive dedication to the warehouse fight scene. \nElizabeth Olsen contributes a strong supporting effort. While the protagonist is a product of his own hatred, Elizabeth Olsen's character is one who adds a contrasting feeling through her genuinely sympathetic nature and gentle line delivery. She knows how to channel intensity in the right moments, but she maintains a kind-hearted nature the entire time which sparks an affectionate chemistry with Josh Brolin. The two create an engaging romantic affair for the story which is far more genuine than in the standard drama based on the fact that they cater to each other's contrasting personalities well and help to give peace of mind to each other in the harsh territory of the world around them. Elizabeth Olsen works to lighten the mood in Oldboy at the right moment, and her presence is a truly engaging one.\nSharlto Copley is also a strong presence. Known in Hollywood for his collaborations with Neil Blomkamp above all else, Sharlto Copley takes a step back in Oldboy and puts himself into a more character-oriented role. It's hard to appreciate the character all that much considering the large number of changes made from the original character in Park Chan-wook's film, but Sharlto Copley has no problem capturing the sophisticated line delivery of the character and using it in a subtle manner of manipulative antagonism. Sharlto Copley's strong talent for consistent line delivery makes him a befitting presence in Oldboy. \nSamuel L. Jackson is also a strong presence due to his natural antagonism.\n\nSpike Lee's strong sense of style and some engaging performances from Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen help to make Oldboy a watchable film, but the alteration of key plot points changes the narrative trajectory of the entire film making it pale all too heavily in comparison to the original.",

Brolin delivers a nuanced performance, one where the character actually feels calm and collected and driven by logic, not hate. Maybe this creates a more identifiable character. On the flipside, it is a more normal character and a much more boring character.\n\nIf Oldboy didn't have the shackles of the original Oldboy's brilliance holding it down, it would be as-is at worst an interesting movie.

Knowing Lee's history, when I heard that he was attached to this project, I really was expecting them to make this crime thriller about somewhat stereotypical black people, and I invite any one of you liberals to say anything about that if you weren't thinking the exact same thing. Well, in all fairness, they were thinking about getting Will Smith to star in this, back when they were thinking about getting Steven Spielberg to direct, but they decided to really reverse races here, and I'd have to guess that it's because if they can't make this film Korean crazy, they can at least keep it white guy crazy... because I've already talked some trash about black stereotypes and don't want to be called a racist. Oh, maybe Lee was just so into the idea of not getting all that black with his filmmaking this time around, so much so that he really underplays the iconic hammer aspects in order to avoid MC Hammer puns... which would only be made by me, in all of my shamelessness. Yeah, if anything is being reversed here, it's Josh Brolin role in a mission to seek vengeance, because he's ready to show just how brutal he can get in this, \"No Country for Oldboy\"! I've been making lame puns all throughout this article opener, but, I'm sorry, you've just got to let me bask in the glory of that one, because it's probably a little more inspired than this film, which is decent and all, but still mighty flawed.\r\n\r\nRunning just over 100 minutes, the film is not quite as long as its two-hour-long source material, and considering that it's not quite as bogged down by overtly overstylized storytelling filler, it's arguably not as overlong, although it is still pretty decidedly overlong, especially with a relatively sprawling development segment that was actually not so overdrawn in the original, and is followed by some other draggy points in filler and expendable material. This excess material might be easier to forgive if it was at least more refreshing, and by that, I'm not simply referring to the fat around the plot edges, but to those subtle twists and turns in the original's narrative that end up plummeting into glaring storytelling tropes, while the conventional occasions hit by the original go intensified. The predictability in this story is hardly helped by its being recycled at all, because even though this film puts some ambitious twists to the original's story elements, many of which are worthy, it's impossible to not feel too much of a sense of familiarity when the film gets to be lazy in its recycling of a story that has its own problems to begin with. Among these issues are histrionics, many of which have been toned down in this more Americanized interpretation of Asian melodrama, though not to where you can't call into question a lot of actions committed by and elements to the crafting of the characters, whose questionable attributes in the concept are made all the more glaring by an overwrought interpretation. As with all Spike Lee joins, about as big an issue as anything in this film is the borderline absence of subtlety, not just within the tonally overblown melodramatics, but within overstylization which somehow not quite as overblown as it was in the original, but still overbearing enough to further dilutes substance. If feel that there are a few key things actually done better this time around, but the moments of lesser inspiration tend to really laze out, bringing the final product shy of an already underwhelming original, and pretty decidedly into underwhelmingness by its own right. Like the original, this film could have gone pretty far, but it still goes far enough to endear, and do a degree of justice to an intriguing story concept.\r\n\r\nThis story concept has always been a little over-the-top, but it's also always been intriguing, with perplexing mysteries and thought-provoking themes on vengeance that this remake seems to want to explore in a different light, less much less focus on revenge, and more focus on redemption. This story retains many of the original's strong elements, and is admittedly stronger in certain places, and no matter how sloppy this interpretation gets, it does deserve some praise, with Mark Protosevich turning in a script that meets excesses and subtlety issues with some well-rounded attributes to characterization, and tight set pieces. Even Spike Lee's direction has its fair share of moments, particularly with a style that is often overwrought, and just as often colorful enough to entertain, particularly during intricately well-staged and brutal action sequences that add a sense of consequence to the dramatics, whose more thoughtful moments are genuinely effective, at least in the drawing of tension. Honestly, outside of style, Lee's direction is mostly pretty lacking, but it's never less than entertaining, and that holds your interest until some reasonably gripping dramatic highlights which might simply be so engaging because of the performances. Lee once again works with a solid cast of respectable talents who don't have much to with, but do what they can to all but, if not ultimately transcend questionable characterization and create some colorful roles, some of the more memorable of which belong to the predictably delightfully over-the-top Samuel L. Jackson, the lovely and subtly emotive Elizabeth Olsen, and the charismatic and often effective, if rather cheesy Sharlto Copley. Of course, the real force in, not simply the film's cast, but in the drama itself is Josh Brolin, who inherits a challenging role that Choi Min-sik set a standard for selling, and is, as shocking as this may sound, expanded upon in this remake, which further explores the lead, in the form of Joe Doucett (I only mention the character's name so that I can shamelessly take you back to the run-on gag of the opener and say, \"Hey Joe, where you goin' with that hammer in your hand?\"), as a man who is not simply seeking vengeance, but redemption and closure in other ways, for great flaws that are initially drawn seriously heavy-handedly, then, surprisingly, worked through subtly, certainly not through subtle writing, but through a nuanced performance by Brolin that goes above and beyond the call of duty in utilizing powerful dramatic highlights and near-transformative layers in order to mold a genuinely compelling protagonist, as well as, of all things, a truly revelatory performance for Brolin. Brolin's material is not consistent enough to make one of the best lead performances of the year, but if you see this film for nothing else, see it for Brolin's perhaps unfittingly inspired performance, for it's not as though the other film has much which is that effective to offer, which isn't to say that style and storytelling don't carry enough intrigue to make this a reasonably fair thriller, for all its many shortcomings.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the film takes a little too long to tell a formulaic and histrionic story with a wealth of subtlety lapses, and a certain placement of style over substance that reflects a laziness which secure the final product as underwhelming, yet still fair, thanks to an intriguing story concept's being done enough justice by some nifty scripting twists, lively direction and strong acting - especially by a surprisingly outstanding Josh Brolin - to make Spike Lee's \"Oldboy\" a reasonably worthy remake and engaging thriller by its own right, despite its falling a ways short of what it could have been.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

            "content": "A remake of a film works when it brings something new to the table. Taking a different angle, era, country, spin on the original, while paying respect to the original source material. For example The Thing or Assault on Precinct 13. where John Carpenter takes legendary films and updates them for a modern day audience, almost servicing the story better. Equally there are remakes like Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, that improve on the original by pacing the story better, taking a slightly different angle and making the film work better as a package.Then there is the pointless remake that no matter how long after it is achieved, the film copies the original so closely that its a wonder it got made in the first place. Oldboy falls into the latter category. I'll Admit I was surprised to find out the talent behind this film and actually postponed shouting violent words at computer screens for a while due to thinking, \"Its been a while since the original came out... Maybe bringing it to life in America could add something... Spike Lee's actually a pretty good director.\" With this outing that last part is still true, this film is well enough directed, it looks pretty amazing and Josh Brolin does a fantastic job of recreating our protagonist, in this case Joe, to such an extent he is almost unrecondnisable. However the films determination to continually hit you over the head with subtle plot points and lack of originality leave fans of the original bored and unimpressed and new comers guessing any big reveal before it happens. Oldboy is set in the 90's, business man Joe is a wild alchoholic, a terrible father and a womanizer. After a series a collosal fuck ups, Joe is imprisioned by an unknown source for twenty years. While captured he finds out he has been framed for the murder of his wife and creates a new found love for his child of 3 years old Mia, swearing to get revenge and rekindle their relationship. Eventually let free, Joe then goes on a rampage of vengence until he can bring those responsible to justice and be a part of his daughters life again. It should be powerful stuff and in the original it touches you. It's themes are relatable and rich. But here we just continually get hit over the head with a hammer, Joe is an ass hole! The film takes what seems like an ungodly long time setting everything up, copying the source material almost scene by scene, however making sure the audience know exactly what is going on at all times. Part of the originals lure is that you knew just as much as the protagonist knew, you were just as in the dark about his goings on as he was. However here, were under no illusion, and the movies biggest flaw, is that the big plot twist is instantly known, you would have thought, Spike would have changed it up a little, lets just say, this movie is so convieniant that if you havent guessed the ending by at least 30 minutes in, you are a complete idiot. Also the movie doesnt try and bring itself up to date, no no, it just thinks that by having a nice little bit of product placement with an Iphone, thats enough to spice things up... its cringe worthy at best. Which is a shame because all the time watching this, i actually want to see this film succeed. It looks stunning, the grade on this film is gorgeous. The dynamic shots are fantastic, Spikes take on the famous hammer fight, pays homage to the original while changing it up a wee bit. Its slick, its stylish, the music is brilliant, the actors for the most part are brutally savage or wonderfully realized, except Sharlito Copley, Its not that his performance is bad, its just whoever decided that accent and origin of that character, should be fired, it is so comically out of place and so stereotypical that you will be left in hysterics by the antagonist the entire time, which is a disservice to his performance as he actually does something well here, minus the accent. Brolin, Olsen, Jackson all bring their characters to life in a decent way. It's just this movie lack relevance. The original was of its time, looked wonderful, hit hard but was always subtle. Here we have an uninspired antipasti board of everything that made the film tick in the original, only this time the pieces are laid on so thick, any subtlety and intrigue are lost before the 2nd act even begins. Fans of the original will hum and haw throughout this entire experience. Newcomers will find something enjoyable here, however predictable it will be. It begs the question, what was the point? Nothing new is achieved, nothing is revamped or set in motion, nothing about this film has originality or intrigue.  As Pointless as Gus Van Sant's Psycho, this is an exercise on how not to remake a film.",

I did like Spike Lee's plot twists, which did add suspense for viewers of the original, such as the fake TV show or the father incesting with the whole family! Spike Lee also did a better job at demonizing the main character played by Josh Brolin. In the original, the main character was just a random guy who didn't seem to have any negative qualities except alcoholism, which both protagonists shared. Not sure if the Korean actors or scripts were better, but the main twist at the climax of the movie was more shocking, and more dramatic than its American counterpart.",

I had curiosity as to what Lee could bring to the table and thought that the cast was pretty interesting as well. After seeing this film I can honestly see how difficult it must have been for Chan-wook Park to pull off such an ultra-stylish and violent movie, because Lee never manages to engage those of us that are already familiar with the revenge story. One of the things that the Korean film had going for it was the fantastic shocking ending, and Lee couldn't just rely on that surprise factor now. It would be like having someone remake The Sixth Sense; it would be an impossible feat to pull off considering how it relies heavily on that final twist. The other scene we all remember from the original film is the hallway hammer scene, and there was no way Lee could have left that scene out. He should have though because the scene felt completely out of tone with the rest of the film. The violence in this film never seems to have a purpose like it did in the Asian version. What this Oldboy lacked was the style and sense of purpose that Chan-wook Park's version had with some memorable characters and unforgettable scenes. The chemistry between Brolin and Olsen is nothing compared to the leads in the Asian film who really kept us engaged and interested in the story. This just proves how difficult it really is to capture that sense of style some of the Korean directors handle so masterfully. \n\nThe general story is pretty similar to Chan-wook Park's film with some minor changes. The screenplay was actually adapted by Mark Protosevich from the Japanese manga, not the film. This time the anti-hero's name is, Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin); he's an advertising executive who is kidnapped and held captive in a small prison decorated as a hotel room for 20 years. During his mysterious abduction his wife is murdered and he is framed for the crime, while his 3 year old daughter, Mia, is adopted by another family. Not knowing who is holding him captive and for what reason, Joe's only window to the world is the television set he has in front of him. During his captivity Joe decides to get back in physical shape and stop drinking, hoping some day he can confront his captors and return to his daughter. Finally after 20 years he wakes up in a box a free man with no explanation as to why he was held captive all these years. He is given a cellphone, some cash, and the letters he has written for his daughter. The first thing Joe does is find his friend, Chucky (Michael Imperioli), who owns a nearby bar. Chucky helps Joe make a list of the people who might have done this to him. Joe also befriends a nurse named Marie (Elizabeth Olsen), who believes his story after seeing the poor conditions he's in. Together they search for answers as Joe plans his revenge, but the real question is why he was held captive for so many years and then all of a sudden released. \n\nJosh Brolin wasn't bad in the lead role, while Elizabeth Olsen also delivered a solid performance, but the film relied heavily on the chemistry between both characters and it wasn't really there. Samuel L. Jackson had a wacky supporting role, while Sharlto Copley played a convincing villain. His performance reminded me the most to the original character because he was more creepy than actually frightening. There were some minor changes to the ending which I thought weren't as effective, but perhaps it had to do with how shocking I found the original film. This film is much shorter than the original and perhaps it's not all Lee's fault considering the studio didn't allow him to release his original 140 minute cut which could have given the characters a better background story. This version felt rushed at times. If you have't seen either film skip this remake and watch the original instead.",

The other scene we all remember from the original film is the hallway hammer scene, and there was no way Lee could have left that scene out. He should have though because the scene felt completely out of tone with the rest of the film. The violence in this film never seems to have a purpose like it did in the Asian version. What this Oldboy lacked was the style and sense of purpose that Chan-wook Park's version had with some memorable characters and unforgettable scenes. The chemistry between Brolin and Olsen is nothing compared to the leads in the Asian film who really kept us engaged and interested in the story. This just proves how difficult it really is to capture that sense of style some of the Korean directors handle so masterfully. \n\nThe general story is pretty similar to Chan-wook Park's film with some minor changes. The screenplay was actually adapted by Mark Protosevich from the Japanese manga, not the film. This time the anti-hero's name is, Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin); he's an advertising executive who is kidnapped and held captive in a small prison decorated as a hotel room for 20 years. During his mysterious abduction his wife is murdered and he is framed for the crime, while his 3 year old daughter, Mia, is adopted by another family. Not knowing who is holding him captive and for what reason, Joe's only window to the world is the television set he has in front of him. During his captivity Joe decides to get back in physical shape and stop drinking, hoping some day he can confront his captors and return to his daughter. Finally after 20 years he wakes up in a box a free man with no explanation as to why he was held captive all these years. He is given a cellphone, some cash, and the letters he has written for his daughter. The first thing Joe does is find his friend, Chucky (Michael Imperioli), who owns a nearby bar. Chucky helps Joe make a list of the people who might have done this to him. Joe also befriends a nurse named Marie (Elizabeth Olsen), who believes his story after seeing the poor conditions he's in. Together they search for answers as Joe plans his revenge, but the real question is why he was held captive for so many years and then all of a sudden released. \n\nJosh Brolin wasn't bad in the lead role, while Elizabeth Olsen also delivered a solid performance, but the film relied heavily on the chemistry between both characters and it wasn't really there. Samuel L. Jackson had a wacky supporting role, while Sharlto Copley played a convincing villain. His performance reminded me the most to the original character because he was more creepy than actually frightening. There were some minor changes to the ending which I thought weren't as effective, but perhaps it had to do with how shocking I found the original film. This film is much shorter than the original and perhaps it's not all Lee's fault considering the studio didn't allow him to release his original 140 minute cut which could have given the characters a better background story. This version felt rushed at times. If you have't seen either film skip this remake and watch the original instead.",

            "content": "Ever since the success of the Grudge, 10 years ago, American filmmakers have been looking to popular overseas films for original ideas, many times simply remaking them. To many, this seems like a desperation move for original material, but I see it more as a cultural thing. Movies often reflect the society of the country they were made in, and by remaking them in the United States, the story introduces movie lovers to something unique, from a different culture. I personally find this very desirable and have appreciated many of these remakes, even when I didn't love the story. In his latest venture, Spike Lee takes on the Korean classic, Oldboy. This is a film that was remade simply because of how bizarre and shocking the story is. The year is 1993, and Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) isn't a great guy. For some reason, he's drugged and then locked away in a pretty decent looking room without doors or windows, and held there for exactly 20 years. Then, just as suddenly as he was imprisoned, he was released, and goes on a search for answers, in this seemingly new world. Josh Brolin stars and is usually pretty good as an ancillary character, but as the star of a thriller, I was skeptical. As always, he could have shown some more emotion, but he was much better than I thought he'd be. Spike Lee gives him as much help as he can, by giving him a huge cast of supporting actors, all of whom had name recognition. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson playing a psychopath, was very funny, and definitely injected some much needed humor. Oldboy is one of those films where it all comes down to the ending. If you're unfamiliar with the story, I won't say anything other than to tell you, that it is bizarre and twisted, with an ending the likes of which you couldn't possibly have imagined. Even if you start to watch this film and don't really like it, stick with it, because the ending really is that good.",

First off it is high concept, which means the whole story revolves around a rather extreme situation in which the plot itself is a mystery. A man is abducted and imprisoned for 20 years then released and provided with a mission to discover the why behind it.  This is a remake of a Korean film which I haven't seen but which was favorably reviewed.  \nThe strength of this concept is that you are almost forced to be engaged and interested in order to find out exactly what is going on.  In a bit of a stylistic departure Spike Lee directs, and he suceeds in giving the film the creepy aura that demands, as well as a suprisingly intense and visceral handling of the action sequences. However it is very clear that this movie has been over edited by someone (a little research will tell you that this was done by the producers).  The impact of this editing is that the relationships and decisions that would right fully require some build up are presented too rapidly to seem rationale.  Watching the scenes it is clear that Lee understood the tone and pacing that was needed, he was just apparently robbed of the final cut.  Having said that there are elements of the script that ultimately don't pass the smell test of \"how would a person really respond in this situation?\" I would expect Lee to ferret out these weak spots but he clearly did not, or was overruled by someone. \nSo why should you see it? Because this is an unusal melange of movies like Chinatown, Saw, and a Hong Kong action film.  You just don't see movies like this being made today, it's different with a capital D.  While it does fail at the narrative level, it so far removed from the usual fare that it is worth seeing for that reason alone.",

Josh Brolin put in an excellent performance, but it's the storyline that let's the movie down. If Spike Lee would have given the movie a different name and stayed away from the original, the movie wouldn't have been that bad, but the whole shock value from the original is gone so Spike Lee had to add in a few new elements which just didn't work. I also think that Josh Brolin wasn't the perfect choice for the leading role because of his, all American brutal acting style which is far from the character who played the original role, but that's not to say that he didn't give it his all. Anyway, the film is watchable and intense throughout, but I expected better from such a great concept. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nJudging by the money that this movie made, it seems like people are staying away from Spike Lee movies nowadays because of his political views and the amount of arguments that he has had in Hollywood. Back in the day, his movies were very pro-black and he had a certain type of audience that always rushed to see his movies, but he has even lost that audience of late, hence the box office takings for this film. The question is, will he ever be taken seriously again? Anyway, Josh Brolin really pushed his acting skills to the limit with this film and it's a shame that he didn't get the props that he deserved. The weight lose and the mad fighting scenes showed that he was really taking this role seriously, but the script let him down. I would watch it again just for his performance, but the movie in whole was poor.\n\nBudget: $30million\nWorldwide Gross: $5million (Terrible!)\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are familiar with the original Oldboy which is about a man whose locked in a room 20 years. 4/10",

            "content": "Park Chan Wook's 2004 Korean original of \"Oldboy\" is one of the most visceral and emotionally devastating thrillers that you're ever likely to find. As a result, it totally baffled me when I heard about the intentions for an English language remake. I don't care how much of an impressive cast or crew were assembled, as far as I see it, there really isn't anything else that could have been brought to treading this ground again. Now that I've seen Spike Lee's version, I stand by that even more. This was a completely pointless exercise.\n\nEstranged husband and father Joe Doucett (Josh Brolin) is on a downward spiral with his alcohol problem. One drunken night he's kidnapped from the streets and wakes up in a locked room with no windows and no means of communication. He's held here without explanation, while on the outside he's framed for the murder of his ex-wife. After 20 years in this locked room, heâ??s suddenly released and sets about finding out the truth and why he was held in the the first place.\n\nI'll start with the (very few) positives this film has to offer and that simply comes down to Josh Brolin and Elizabeth Olsen. They are both on particularly fine form and give this misguided endeavour more than it actually deserves. The same can't be said for the villains of the piece, though. Normally, the nasties are the one's that stand out in a film of this type but in this case, it's them that suffer the most in their caricature roles; Jackson is his usual, reliable self and (with that idiosyncratic tone of his) can make even the worst of dialogue work for him. He adds a requisite sprinkle of menace but he's so elaborately overdressed that he looks like he's just there to do a little turn on the catwalk. Copley, on the other hand, I feel both sorry and embarrassed for. He's even more ridiculous. His accent and histrionics are so laughably bad and completely misplaced that he looks like he's wandered in from a child's pantomime. The only thing missing was an audience taking great delight in booing or hissing him off the stage. If Copley doesn't get his act together soon, he'll fade into obscurity and his wonderful work in \"District 9\" will be a thing of the past.\n\nThe film itself looks the part, though, and Spike Lee almost gives the impression that he knows what he's doing by capturing a suitably grim and foreboding atmosphere. However, it's ultimately the script that lets everyone down here. It's practically a scene-for-scene remake of the original (well, the good bits at least) but the changes that they do make to the story don't improve it in the slightest. It really is perplexing why they would've even went to the bother and why such an acclaimed director and cast would put their reputations at stake.\n\nThe scene that stood out for me was the ridiculous hallway fight (where Lee is obviously trying to emulate Park's impressive handling of a similar one-take scene from the original). Here, Brolin takes on an abundance of adversaries and it's obvious how badly choreographed it is. His opponents are absolutely nowhere near him as they swipe the air with pieces of plywood while our man sets about them with his claw hammer. It's was around this point that I gave up on the whole affair, as it was apparent that the filmmakers were putting as much of an effort into the film as I am this review.\n\nWith almost ten years between them, I can only assume that Hollywood thought that this was ripe for a remake. It's not! Granted, it might work a lot better for those that are unfamiliar with the original but for others, it's pretty much a guarantee that it won't. If it does appeal to those that are already versed in Park's sublime original, then I'll eat my claw hammer with a live Octopi chaser.\n\nMark Walker",

The result is a film that never feels quite right, despite some good efforts. It's a film that tries, yet yields to uneven execution.\n\nThe films' premise is conceptually over-the-top and outlandish in its reasoning, following a man who finds himself confined in a hotel-room like setting for 20 years, only to be unexpectedly released, left to aimlessly search for his captors. \n\nTo the film's credit, it features some strong actors, being headlined by Josh Brolin in an admirable performance, with character actors such as Samuel Jackson providing some more texture to the film. All of them work individually, yet the tones the actors bring on screen never quite mesh. Brolin is dark and brooding, Elizabeth Olsen is appropriately melodramatic, and yet Samuel Jackson and Sharlto Copley feel more farcical and self deprecating. This is undoubtedly a symptom of the film's larger problem, its tone. Lee gives us a film that never feels like it knows what it wants to be, giving us highly stylized fight sequences in one scene, followed by much more grounded and ostensibly straight material in the next. It's satirical in some instances, and very self-serious in others. There is never a successful balance struck with this, and thus the result is a film that feels confused and poorly conceived.\n\nThis is not to say that Oldboy does not having any effectual scenes or successful elements. The stylized moments are gritty and well done, Brolin's performance is strong, the violence is disturbing, and there's a host of interesting elements on screen. The problem is the lack of cohesion, with the entire film not only feeling disjointed, but also rushed. The finale is not nearly as shocking as it should be, and the film's disturbing nature never quite resonates, simply because we don't know how to take in the film. \n\n2.5/5 Stars",

However it has the usual dumbing down syndrome that Hollywood does and takes a few liberties with the baddies (over the top to the point of being forced camp). It also shys away from wider themes of psychology and loss that the original had, merely reducing the tone to borderline popcorn fodder. If you know nothing about the original you will probably really like this, especially the great twist, but the credit for that goes to the original film for the cinematic template and to a comic for the storyline so before you praise this version make sure you know where it is due.",

For viewers unfamiliar with the history behind Spike Lee's \"Oldboy,\" the 2013 film is a remake of the cult-classic 2003 South Korean film of the same name, directed by Chan-wook Park. The Korean masterpiece possess a highly stylized, gritty sensibility while providing an emotional depth to its characters. Iconic director Spike Lee's \"Oldboy\" is as a handsomely shot piece of genre entertainment, but it fails in its attempt to define itself, resulting into a completely pointless, watered-down underwhelming thriller.\n\nAn alcoholic whose life is falling apart, Joe (Josh Brolin) is far from the ideal father who is willfully neglecting his three-year-old daughter, Mia. Drugged and kidnapped one night, Joe awakens in a small room with a television, only to learn that he's been framed for the murder of his ex-wife, and will spend the next 20 years trapped in this cell where he is held as a prisoner. During the duration of his imprisonment, he trains his mind and body for escape attempts while pouring his heart out to Mia in letters. After two decades of torment, Joe is suddenly set free, seeking out an old friend Chucky (Michael Imperioli), and meeting Marie (Elizabeth Olsen), an advocate for the homeless who helps him in his cause. Hunting for the individual who locked him away, Joe spares no one as he works his way to Adrian (Sharlto Copley), a deranged man masterminding the mystery Joe and Marie are now determined to solve.\n\nDirector Spike Lee, working from a screenplay by Mark Protosevich \"I Am Legend\" (2007), chooses to simply rehash the plot for his American remake, and quickly rushes through the unusual and unique storyline unable to establish an emotional connection with the audience which the original film develops so well. Lee's picture clocks in at a lean 104 minutes, 16 minutes shorter than Park's \"Oldboy.\" As a result, the storytelling is rather straightforward, and it forces Lee to rush through crucial sequences which are not given the adequate time to develop. Subtly goes by the waste side, and almost abandoned completely early into the third act in favor of expeditious explanations.\n\nThe remake remains largely faithful to the story of the 2003 effort, but seriously lacks in intensity and a sense of meaning. The original film achieves a sublime blending of ultra-violence with extreme art, while the remake feels bogged down in its copycat status, and its overall lighter tone hampers its enigmatic, disconcerting story of revenge. My advice is to avoid this altogether, pull up the original on Netflix, and deal with the subtitles America.",

Sharlto Copley as the villain, however, feels like a cheesy 70s Bond villain / Jodie Foster in Elysium.

            "content": "If you know me or you're one of my closest friends then you're probably aware that the original Oldboy is my favorite movie of all time.  It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it is my favorite.  It's a movie that I, many years ago, introduced to my friends at high school and many of them loved the film as well.  I've watched the film at least 10 times over the past 9 years I've owned the DVD, I even have the special 3-disc box set that includes the manga the original film is based on.  So you could say that I am a gigantic fan of the film, so that may make some of you out there, if anyone ever reads this, which I doubt, that this is the rantings of a fanboy who isn't choosing to be fair to this film because it's a remake of his favorite movie of all time.  I get all of that.  But I'm here to tell you that I went into this film with a completely open mind, and this is pre-release before the reviews came out, and I was really excited because the cast, while not necessarily my dream cast, as I always had in mind Viggo Mortensen as the 'hero' and Javier Bardem, or Benicio Del Toro, as the 'villain'.  I'd have chosen Elizabeth Olsen right from the start, but Josh Brolin and Sharlto Copley are both incredibly talented actors, and underrated in the case of Sharlto.  So I was really happy that the cast was full of talented people.  I'm not the biggest Spike Lee fan in the world, but he is talented, so I thought that the film really did have a chance to be good.  As you can see by the rating, the film is anything but.  The film being edited down to 100-minutes from the original 140-minute cut Spike Lee handed the producers.  This caused some controversy as both Josh Brolin and Spike Lee hated the final cut, Spike Lee even removed his trademark 'Spike Lee Joint' in favor of the more traditional 'Spike Lee Film'.  Personally, I hope Lee's original cut sees the light of day, because this film was absolutely missing something.  Something that very well could've existed in Lee's original cut.  This edited version simply runs over some of the original film's themes.  For example, the film is as much a love story as it is a revenge thriller and you don't really get a sense that Marie and Joe truly fell in love because their relationship isn't really explored in the final cut of the film.  Another thing the original film did exquisitely is sort of reverse the roles of villain/hero by the climax.  The villain in the original film doesn't exactly become the hero, but you can see that he was really affected by what happened in his past and in many ways you feel sorry for what he had to go through and you end up despising the hero for what he did when he was younger.  In this film the approach to the hero and the villain is far more simplified and direct.  While Joe was very much an asshole when he was in school, the film makes it really hard to feel sorry for Adryan in any way.  Again, this might've been present in the original cut of the film.  You may ask yourself why so openly comparing the original film to the remake rather than looking at it on its own merits.  This is a very logical question.  The reason I'm doing this is because this remake, outside of expanding some stuff, is almost exactly as the original film.  Of course the actors, the locations and the way it was shot changed, but the important plot points remain exactly the same as the original film.  The only thing that's different, and that I liked, is the ending.  And this is everything after Joe finds out the truth at the end.  I really liked that, because it was legitimately the only thing about the remake that was truly different from the original.  I still liked the ending in the original much better as it focused more on the monster that Oh Dae Su had become in his search for vengeance and how he copes with that on top of what he knows about the woman he fell in love with.  One key scene is left out, and you'll know the one, but they allude to it in a pretty cool scene.  I think that that scene was essential to the development of the character in the original film, because he had fed dumplings nonstop for 15 years by his captors, that he wanted to feel something that was alive, which in turn made him do what he did at the restaurant.  But I digress, the best remakes are those that are faithful to its source material but they also add some new little twists and turns to make the experience completely new to those that watched the film you're remaking.  If you're gonna do the same film over again, then what's the point?  I can watch the original film and get more out of it.  Yes, if you stray too far from the source material you risk alienating the same people you're appealing to with the remake, but take a risk.  I'd have rather seen this movie take risks and alienate those hardcore fans than seeing the same movie I've already seen multiple times.  This movie just isn't really that good, it uses violence in order to disguise the fact that the film is a pretty shallow experience.  The film just never seems to get its foot out of the gate.  It doesn't build tension nor does it really build its characters the way it should've.  Say what you will about the original film, but that movie was all about the characters.  This film isn't.  Again, this is something that could've been present in Lee's original cut, but in its current state it just doesn't have good character development.  The cast is good though, they're easily the best part of the film.  Though I did find Sharlto's character to be really fucking goofy at times with how he was presented.  He felt like a really bad Bond villain at times.  This is not on Sharlto, as he does the best he can with what he was given.  Josh Brolin delivers the goods as does Elizabeth Olsen.  They're both quite good in this movie and it's just a shame to see that their relationship wasn't as developed as it could've been.  Another thing that I wanted to see was how they handled Oh Dae Su's pathetic breakdown at the end of the film when he finds out the truth and how he begs Woo-Jin not to reveal the truth to Mi-do, that's the character known as Mia in this film.  That scene was absolutely powerful in how pathetic Oh Dae Su became when he found out the truth and how he was willing to be Woo-Jin's slave just so he wouldn't reveal the truth to Mi-Do.  Dae Su was wagging his tale as if he was a dog and licking Woo-Jin's shoes.  It's the type of thing you don't normally see your hero, who's spent the entire movie being a badass, do.  And I was interested in seeing how this film handled that.  Let me just say it wasn't as close to as pathetic as it was in the original film and that was really a shame, because that was easily the most important scene in the film.  You have this guy going on this violent rampage to find out why he was being imprisoned for as long as he was...and at the end he becomes a joke, a shell of his former self, and he's doing it all because his love for Mi-Do.  If there was a scene I wish the film remained 100% faithful to, it was this one.  Because this is something that you don't see in many American movies.  You don't see the 'hero' of the film completely breakdown in hysterics, completely embarrassing himself in order to protect the person he loves.  But that's just me.  But I digress, I think this review has gone on long enough.  If you thought this review spent too much time comparing the original film and the remake, then that's because that was the intention.  This film does absolutely nothing new of its own and that is ultimately its biggest downfall.  That, and the fact that it just doesn't know how to build proper tension.  Not a terrible film at all, but if you're a fan of the original film then you'd just be better off watching that again.  This will not add anything nor does it complement the original at all.  This is a massive disappointment, not a good movie at all.",

And when Sam the man Jackson shows up to play a secondary bad guy that's usually a good sign. But it wasn't great. It seemed to rubber band between high quality and low budget. Which was very very strange. During a the fight scene where brohlin kicks many a henchman ass with a hammer, they insert awkward stabbing sounds with no blood to be seen? And while it was slightly different and high paced some of the henchman did some akward mistimed super spins and flips. And then the next scene was high quality acting. I was a little baffled wether I loved it or hated it at times. The thriller element was off. I never felt like we were in the hunt for answer (that we cared about) until the last ten minutes of the film. It was kind of clunky and was not at all a mystery you were presented with the information to try to guess in anticipation like a true thriller should. As a bonus for the ladies brohlin is starting to get jacked. For the men Elizabeth Olsen... Well you'll see but heck yeah for that. But then at the end you learn a very ugly truth and it's strange and gross. Watch this out of curiosity",

American director Spike Lee (Malcolm X) has decided to remake the classic-ish 2003 Chan-wook Park (Stoker) film of the same name that is stylish, twisted and dark and definitely worth checking out.  Lee has removed the beating heart from that film and has given us a stone-cold, horribly ridiculous film starring Josh Brolin (Milk) as Joe Doucette, a man who is kidnapped off of the streets and held in a hotel-room cell for twenty years with nothing but bad food for sustenance and shoddy television for entertainment.  Before his confinement, we learn that Joe is a drunken lout who wants to skip his daughter's third birthday who also likes to verbally berate his wife.  Soon after he is kidnapped, it is revealed his wife has been brutally murdered and he is the primary suspect  After the twenty years are up and he is mysteriously set free (?), Joe searches for his abductor and wants to learn the fate of his daughter (whom he apparently now cares for because he has learned she plays the cello).  An old friend of his (Michael Imperioli - 'The Sopranos') and a new one (Elizabeth Olsen - Martha Marcy May Marlene) help him on his quest in which he confronts a sadistic torturer (Samuel L. Jackson - Pulp Fiction) and re-encounters a man he briefly knew in his youth (Sharlto Copley - District 9).  Jackson and Copley do their very best to make this film quite insufferable but Brolin doesn't do much to help it either as his groans and cries of pain and suffering are nearly unbearable.  Why Lee decided to put a different spin on a decent film is beyond me ... perhaps it is because the director has nothing left of his own to give us.  His career of late has been nearly as sad as this film.  Avoid this.  Do.",

Wanted to see it in the theater pretty bad, but it didn't play anywhere near us so I wasn't able to.  I had a lot of concerns about this, because I didn't think Spike Lee(the director) had the balls to do what was done in the original. Well, I'm happy to say other than two scenes(which should have been in this), he does a very good job of remaking it, and has more balls than I previously thought.  I'd say the ending is why this wasn't playing around me, because it's pretty controversial, especially for Americans.  For those that don't know it's about a guy(Josh Brolin) who gets kidnapped and imprisoned for 20 years, then is let go.  He needs to figure out who imprisoned him, why he was imprisoned, and more importantly, why he was let go.  Elizabeth Olsen, Sharlto Copley, and Samuel L. Jackson round out the cast.  Copley is absolutely awesome as the villain.  He is so damn creepy.  Brolin does fantastic, I mean the whole cast is great really.  The action is good.  It's still pretty violent, and very twisted.

            "content": "Having never seen the original version of the film, I went into this new version in the unique position of having no preconceptions about the film.  That isn't to say that I was completely unfamiliar with the material.  In fact, I had seen quite a lot of the original over the years, including the infamous hallway scene.  But aside from that and the overall premise, there was nothing skewing my opinion heading in.\nWith that said, I have to say that this film is a mixed bag for me.  On the one hand, everything is well done.  The film looks good and is edited in a way that keeps everything moving, and we get a committed performance from Brolin in the lead role.  For the first half of the movie, I think it is exactly what it needs to be, a tension building mystery that leaves the audience wondering what's going happening.  On the other hand, once we enter the second half of the film, it starts to crumble beneath its poorly maintained lines of reasoning.  That is to say, plot holes begin to spring too often for your mind to ignore them.  \nNow generally I am not one to point out plot holes, or really give them any thought at all, but there was a point about three quarters through where they began to fill my head and I realized that everything that was happening seemed sillier and sillier.  By the time we find out what is going on, there is no longer any mystery behind it.  And when we discover the motivations behind the events that are transpiring, all believability is lost.  The notion that someone could do all this for that reason not only makes us roll our eyes, but destroys any credibility to the drama.  \nNow I said it was a mixed bag, and it probably seems like I have mostly bad things to say, but the one silver lining to the film is in its end game.  Even though how we get there is beyond belief, the actual plan of the villain is probably one of the most unique and devious I've ever seen.  I'm sure fans of the original know it already, but I didn't see it coming at all.  So as far as a rating goes, this is a tough one, but if you haven't seen the original I would say to give it a shot just for the ending, it's not one you are likely to see again.  6/10",

When all is revealed in the end it loses so much of it's punch. That's where this American remake shines.
