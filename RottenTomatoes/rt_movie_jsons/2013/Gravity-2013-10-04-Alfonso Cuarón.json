Also, the moral choices the characters have to face are nothing novel and are presented with little pathos - been there, done that many times before, and better.\n\nMore generally, characters are incredibly undeveloped (especially Kowalski), which is particularly disappointing when they are so few. There are some interesting moments with Stone, from her hallucinations to Aningaaq, but they are not enough to carry the film.\n\nWhat is especially unforgivable, though, is the utter lack of care for any semblance of scientific accuracy. It is surely understandable that, in order to create an exciting story, science fiction films will, to an extent, be imprecise, but when key elements, such as Kowalski's disconnection from Stone, or the orbits of debris, are inaccurate, suspension of disbelief can only do so much.",

I watched it and now years later, not much is memorable about seeing it. Maybe I have seen Bullock in too many comedies and chick flicks. As a female astronaut she seemed a bit contrived as the helpless femme fatale \"lost in space\". Overall it just didn't work for me as being believable on some nebulous logic level of mine.

            "content": "I remember deciding to watch this movie in cinemas because critics were all praising it as one of the best movies of that year. I watched it in IMAX 3D and remember being blown away by the movie. It won: Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing at the Oscars which is a lot of awards. The synopsis is \"Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission. Her commander is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney), helming his last flight before retirement. Then, during a routine spacewalk by the pair, disaster strikes: The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Ryan and Matt stranded in deep space with no link to Earth and no hope of rescue. As fear turns to panic, they realize that the only way home may be to venture further into space\". I've decided to rewatch it on a whim but this time on my home TV. The question is if this movie is overrated or deserving of its accolades. \n\nLet's talk about the concept first, it's great. A survival movie in space, with no monsters or anything like that, is such a great concept that has not been done before or since its release. The movie perfectly illustrates the horror but also the beauty of space in a way that surprisingly meshes well together. \n\nOn that note of the beauty, the cinematography is amazing. A lot of amazing cinematography is usually using real shots but Gravity does it all through CGI. It shouldn't work as CGI is quite obvious and bad CGI can even take you out of the movie but Gravity doesn't \"fall\" in that category. There are a lot of gorgeous shots that feel like paintings and this is partially thanks to the amazing visual effects. The set design for the space ships are claustrophobic and further emphasise the loneliness within this movie. The score is great and elevates the tension in the scenes where the score is prominent but during the more hopeful scenes, the score is more orchestral and beautiful. The movie doesn't rely on the score too much and sometimes just lets the silence of space or the breathing of the astronauts to suck the audience into the movie and it works.  \n\nThe movie is visually spectacular but what about the characters and story? The movie is revolved around Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who is our point of view character. For the most part, the movie makes us care about her because of the situation she is in and that is fine. However, the director (Alfonso Cuar√≥n) decided to include a scene that elaborates on Ryan Stone's backstory on Earth. This is a good choice as it makes the audience more sympathetic with her and more understanding of why her personality is what it is or why she does certain actions or choices in the movie. Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) is a sort of anchor character that support Ryan throughout the movie. He has a contrasting personality to Ryan as he is funny and charismatic yet due to being more experienced is also one who guides Ryan. I like the dynamic between the two of them and when both of them are interacting it's funny or heartwarming. \n\nI also have to praise Sandra Bulluck as she does a great job in carrying this movie. Her performance whenever she is struggling in space feels genuine and I can feel the fear and panic just from the tone of her voice. She also delivers in the emotional moments that bring the scene to life. She was deserving of that best actress nomination at the Oscars. George Clooney does a pretty good job as well. Although, he mostly just plays Matt as the witty and charming guy. I do like it when the two are together, George overshadows Sandra which sounds weird but that is exactly what it should be in terms of who their characters are and what the plot is asking.\n\nI don't have many flaws with the movie that aren't just nitpicking but I do think the fact that Dr Ryan Stone seems to constantly panic in the first half of the movie kind of weird. Dr Ryan Stone just seems to not know the basics of being in space so know it all Matt Kowalsky constantly has to tell her stuff that I think she should've known. From a movie perspective, I get why this choice was made so that the audience can easily understand things about space but it could've handled way better in my opinion. Additionally, we get some backstory on Dr Ryan Stone but we don't get anything on Matt which I find a bit odd and lessens the impact of a certain scene. Unfortunately, I do think a lot of the impact this movie has is sadly lost because I am not watching it in a cinema. You could argue that with a lot of movies but for me watching this throughout certainly made me think \"this would be way better in a cinema\". \n\nIn conclusion, I still really enjoyed the movie. Yes, the movie is impressive because of its style but in terms of substance, it certainly is lacking. However, the movie is just so visually spectacular that I don't mind it. Furthermore, a lot of great movies such as \"Dunkirk\" and \"1917\" do similar things to Gravity and they are both great movies as well. Gravity still is one of the best space movies to have come out in the last 20 years. I feel this movie accomplishes a lot with visual effects and space cinematography. A lot of people might not be talking about this movie anymore but for me, I certainly will still remember it.",

            "content": "Premiered at the opening night of the Venice Film Festival. It was the first 3D picture to open the festival.\n\nGRAVITY was honored with an American Film Institute Award in 2013 - recognizing it as one of the 10 outstanding films deemed culturally and artistically representative of the year's most significant achievements in the art of the moving image. In addition to Sandra Bullock's Oscar-nominated performance as Dr. Ryan Stone, the film also stars George Clooney - a recipient of the AFI Life Achievement Award.\n\nGRAVITY was nominated for 10 Academy Awards. The film took home seven Oscars at the 2014 ceremony, including Best Director for Alfonso Cuar√≥n and Best Cinematography for Emmanuel Lubezki. Cuar√≥n is one of two directors who has taken home the Oscar for Best Director, but whose films have never won Best Picture.\n\nMovie Trivia DID YOU KNOW? Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n was inspired by John Sturges' film MAROONED in the making of GRAVITY.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Originally, Natalie Portman was going to portray the character of Dr. Ryan Stone. When Portman moved on to another project, Sandra Bullock stepped into the role and garnered an Academy Award¬Æ nomination for her performance.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n and his team - including visual effects supervisor Tim Webber and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki - invented techniques to create \"elastic shots,\" combining live action, computer-generated imagery (CGI), computerized robots and a custom-made, 20 by 10 foot cube \"light box,\" containing panels fitted with 4,096 LED lights. Each of the lights had individual controls, projecting beams on the faces of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney to indicate their characters' environment. Action inside the \"light box\" was filmed with an Arri Alexa digital camera, but 80 percent of the picture was animated by computer, even the clear visors of the actors' spacesuits.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Unofficially advised by NASA, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and the visual effects crew worked to portray the 90-minute duration of daytime that is consistent with orbits around Earth, and matched light sources with the characters' location above their home planet - including \"cool blue lights\" when they were orbiting over the ocean and \"warmer colors\" reflecting the African desert.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Another innovation of the production was a 12-wire rig with a carbon-fiber harness, in which Sandra Bullock was controlled by puppeteers and filmed by various cameras on a motion-control rig to portray tumbling through space. It was challenging to comfortably position the actors in their harnesses and maintain the impression of weightlessness. According to Bullock, she was isolated and whipped around for prolonged periods of time, but she filtered her solitude and duress back into her performance.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Many of the film's sound effects were recorded with contact microphones at automobile factories and hospitals.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? In GRAVITY, the voice of Mission Control at the start of the film is none other than Ed Harris, who played actual mission director Gene Kranz in APOLLO 13 and John Glenn in THE RIGHT STUFF.\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Glenn Freemantle, who won the Oscar¬Æ for Best Achievement in Sound Editing, achieved his distinct sound by recording vibrations. He said, \"We even had an acoustic guitar in a tub of water...we put contact mics on the guitar, we put them on the sides of the bars, we put hydrophones inside it and then we would touch, all different things against the bodies of the guitar...to get the sounds that you hear in the film.\"",

            "content": "GRAVITY\nFilm Review\n\n\"Gravity,\" directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n is about astronauts coping with disaster, is a huge and technically dazzling film. Genre of the movie is Sci-fi and Thriller. The movie casts one of my favorite actress Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, both of them are fabulous actors. It was released on 11 October, 2013 (India). And it won Academy awards in several categories, Best sound mixing, Best Cinematographer, Best Visual effects, Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing and for the Best Director. The Budget for the film was 10 crores USD and its Box Office earning is 72.32 crores USD. It has like7.7 rating on IMDb and 96% on rotten tomatoes. The movie shows some of the mostly asked questions about space. What happens if astronauts get low on Oxygen? Or what if they lose connection with Space Centre? Is asked very frequently, the movie includes this scenario.\n\nThe movie starts with Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (Clooney) in space. Dr. Stone is a first time space traveler along with Kowalski who's also an engineer. But things took steep turn when Kowalski and Dr. Stone both went out of the space shuttle to repair the Hubble telescope but space debris destroys the telescope and their ride home. They were separated and Dr. Stone finds herself marooned in the orbit after the accident struggling to control the anxious heartbeat that flutters on the soundtrack along with her shallow breathing and the sporadic hiss of backpack thruster jets. \"Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission,\" Kowalski tells mission control. Now just for reminder breathing heavily will cost more oxygen and as now they are stranded away from the shuttle they only have limited amount of oxygen supply with them. Now this glues the audience to the seat as to how they will be rescued? Will they survive? And many more interesting facts. The colleagues died in that accident and the way their frozen bodies hard as bricks, faces caved in like pumpkin float around in the space really gave chills. Even after both the protagonists meet each other after the accident it gives a relief to the audience but only for a short time as they're separated again. The movie revolves around the Dr. Stone character and shows her struggle to survive in a very dire situation nobody ever thought of and Cuar√≥n portrayed it really well and for which he got the Oscar which he very much deserved. I very much liked the movie and I think it can be watched over and over without getting bored. And I suggest it is highly recommended for Thriller and Sci-fi viewers. Cuar√≥n trusts Bullock to give us a one-woman show and she delivered it. Her work constitutes one of the greatest physical performances I've ever seen and she's framed in ways that make each moment resonate. The way she twists and turns and swims through zero gravity is a master class in how to suggest interior states with gestures.  \n\nIf someone asks me what \"Gravity\" is about, I'll tell them it's a tense adventure about a space mission gone wrong and very informative. The film is about that moment when you suffered misfortune that seems unendurable and you thought you won't go any further but you had a belief and that turns everything. It gives a great message about life, to never give up, no matter what! Keep fighting and you'll get one day what you deserve.",

            "content": "When something comes out of space to threaten someone in the movies, it's usually a gigantic object ('Armageddon') or an alien invasion ('Independence Day'). 'Gravity' tells us about tiny objects, space debris with an average size of less than an inch, that's a very clever idea to start with. And it's not the whole planet that needs to be saved, only 2 people have to find a possibility how to get safely back on the ground, that's all! Less definitely means more in this case, because when they spend the majority of the budget on the special effects, it's exceptional that the human characters remain in the centre of our attention. The show never gets into the foreground, all the spectacular sights merely provide the background for the 2 actors. In opposite to 'Silent Running', it doesn't hit you with a message, either. It's entertainment and very well made, even if, as some previous reviewers pointed out (I need not repeat the same points here), some physics are dodgy, but a list of technically completely accurate sci-fi flicks would be very short. The makers of 'Gravity' succeeded in making outer space a convincing, hostile environment. But in the first place, 'Gravity' stands out from many soulless sci-fi flicks due to its human qualities. Surely not a movie to be forgotten easily, I'll probably remember it like 'Oh yes, the movie with the 2 astronauts drifting in space'.",

            "content": "It is undoubtedly visually stunning, both the camerawork and the cinematography are mesmerizing, seldomly reaching a certain poetry thanks to the emotional music score (perhaps the most artistical achievement in the film). Even if the screenplay grows in moments of tension, it has its flaws. Maybe the main problem it is that the plot is somehow simple; it is only about one individual facing troubles in space. As it has been seen before, the yuxtaposition of a person in a vast space enhances the feeling of solitude. The film is simply about survival and about going back home. An accurate exemple of the Dorothy Gale's complex. Another aspect about the film that should be mentioned is that the hollowness of the source is repaired with the fascinating visual imagery. Beyond that there is nothing else. Even with its moments of greatness, the main conflict feels flat and not deep enough. Therefore, it is not as philosophical as it is intended to be. The amazing visual imagery at times feels heavy-handed, but Lubezki's graceful eye makes it pleasant to see. As for the actors performances, George Clooney is simply the George Clooney we have seen repeatedly. Whereas Sandra Bullock, she is definetely the soul of the movie. But sometimes, that \"soul\" is just a voice screaming in the space. And during almost thirty minutes, we are not able to fully appreciate her performance because she is in the darkness of her space suit. Her performance is very human though and she is able to touch our hearts. But it is such a pity to realize that at times she is just a voice screaming in the space, just like the movie as a whole; something struggling in the outter space while having trouble to land. Cuar√≥n is an authentic film engineer, but his skills do not match to what movies actually need today; he is just an engineer in the film industry lacking of a sense of art. \"Gravity\" is a good sample of that. The political overtones are something that disappointed me about the film. Cuar√≥n is definetely giving his skills on silver plate to the Hollywood's film industry.",

The acting was terrible. She didn't manage to convey any kind of real emotion or fear except maybe for the initial scene of the accident.

Everything was amplified x100 to make the movie more dramatic, when in fact that made it not plausible and actually killed all the drama. The ending was probably the lowest point of the movie, but on the other hand, so was the rest. The only thing good about this movie are the visuals. Kudos to the special effects team. Other that that it is pure garbage. The critics score on this movie really shows how little they know about space and physics and what little to no value their opinion has.",

To call this a good film is frankly delusional because even if you disregard the objective inaccuracies, almost all of the film is following an idiotic female astronaut who is floating around for the entire film. The lack of realism ruins any emotion that could have been present, and I was actually laughing most of the way through the movie because it's that bad. The two stars are for the visuals.",

From the beginning of the film, the audience is made aware that she lost her 4-year-old daughter after she fell on her head while playing tag--the most inane accident costed a life. The audience can imagine the sorrow that Ryan must have felt, which then likely led her to take on the space mission without fear, having lost any sense of purpose in her life. This makes it all the more significant when Kowalski *spoiler* gives his life to save hers and makes her promise him that she will survive. He gives her a sense of determination and purpose--a promise to make it back to Earth, at least in his memory if not for herself. The most heart-wrenching moment came when she believed she had lost all hope of returning. Embracing her death, she turns on the radio and picks up a signal from a foreign country. Although it can do nothing to save her, she cries of joy as she hears the sound of dogs barking and human voices--the scene is so incredibly raw, looking into the core of the human emotion. This is almost the best part of the movie--how unbelievably raw and realistic the movie is. I would have no clue what outer space is like in actuality, but Gravity is a far improvement from the typical space film. No orchestrated music, or sci-fi powers, or sudden fated miracles (kind of). Throughout the film, the sound is muted, almost blocked, immersing the audience into a space-like setting. When Ryan *again, spoiler* makes it back to earth, she grips the sand and feels grateful for having solid ground under her feet--the sense of purpose that she lost with her daughter has been restored. The entire film is just unbelievably raw and emotional; it has a lot of takeaways for everyone. I would highly recommend it for anyone!",

To compare this to Kubrik's 2001 is quite frankly ridiculous. I started to watch this movie with high expectations following all the accolades, but ended up playing a game of write down all the scientific fails, I had to stop though as I ran out of paper - it would be easier to write down anything they actually got right - basically nothing. \n\nTwo basic facts that they completely got wrong:\n\n1) Space is BIG - hideously so, finding small objects in orbit is hard, navigating to them is even harder due to the complexity of orbital mechanics, yet in this movie, they continually hop from location to location like they were popping next door.\n\n2) Momentum is conserved unless an object is acted upon by an external force - time and time again in this movie they have people and objects completely breaking this rule. If you are in orbit attached to something and you cut yourself loose - you don't drift away! You continue to maintain exactly the same orbit!\n\nI'm always willing to overlook the odd error - movies are for entertainment, they're not documentaries, but when a movie is completely built on fallacies, it becomes too much. I mean, Armageddon was full of the same, but Armageddon was funny and entertaining and clearly not trying to be realistic. Gravity on the other hand is about a woman, acting like any good 1950's woman should i.e. totally clueless and reliant on luck and men to survive, living through a series of catastrophes in the most improbably of ways - that's it! \n\nThe ONLY thing this movie has going for it are the visuals which are spectacular, especially on a big screen.\nIn short, if you have absolutely no scientific understanding of space, you may enjoy this flick - ignorance can be bliss, but otherwise steer clear, it will simply annoy the hell out of you.",

            "content": "Thrillers that are very thin on plot can be fantastic if executed well and this is a prime example of the genre as a director capable of art-house fare, Alfonso Cuaron, brings his talents to a blockbuster. I wasn't particular excited about the film before watching it as I usually don't like films within this genre however this movie is so much better than The Towering Inferno (1974) and Airport (1970) in addition to being nice and short at just ninety minutes. In attempting to watch every Best Picture nominee ever I was aware that I would eventually have to watch this film and I am glad that did because it is a robust piece of entertainment. Having said that I find the film to be a technical marvel but not necessarily something that will emotionally grab you and therefore it wouldn't be my choice for Best Picture.\n\nOn her first mission, Dr. Ryan Stone, Sandra Bullock, is upgrading the Hubble telescope with the assistance of veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, George Clooney, in addition to several other unseen astronauts. Their mission is aborted when debris produced after an accidental Russian missile strike hits them and only Stone and Kowalski survive. With Kowalski's assistance she is able to reach the International Space Station but is forced to let him go so that she can survive. She experiences a great many difficulties in finding a vehicle that will take her back to earth and feels intense loneliness without Kowalski's presence. Eventually she is able to return to earth on a spacecraft and lands in a lake then climbs out onto land, happy to be alive.\n\nEmmanuel Lubezki's cinematography must be commended as the visuals are largely what carry the film. We see tiny specks of water traveling through the air and debris flying at fast speeds into space crafts which gives us a sense of just how small this woman is when compared to the forces of nature which have the ability to destroy her. We feel fear but also awe as early on we hear Stone and Kowalski discuss what they appreciate about being in space and seeing earth from such a different vantage point. Throughout the beauty of the environment around Stone is contrasted with the horrors of her situation as she is alone in silence. At many points we cut away from Stone having a panic attack inside the International Space Station to the silence and cold indifference of the endless space around her. It reminded me of The Tree of Life (2011), a far different movie in many ways, in that it contrasts the very human concerns of the astronauts with the vastness around in a way that is remarkably effective as we understand how insignificant we really are against this infinite backdrop.\n\nYou feel yourself thinking about how difficult it would have been to make this film as you watch it as there is no opportunity to simply cut away to another scene and in many ways it is like a play as you are stuck with a small number of characters as they try to complete a difficult task. Beyond the massive technical achievement that the film is, it deserves all the awards it won in the technical categories, there is a smart script at it's heart that brings life to these characters without indulging in soap opera theatrics. Unlike Airport we don't spend the majority of the film listening to the characters scream at one another about their personal problems before having the disaster element introduced in the last 20 minutes. We get to hear about Stone's tragic backstory, her young daughter died, and this is revisited once or twice after it is revealed early on in the film but it never feels overly manipulative and never becomes dull. Clooney and Bullock do rely on their movie star charisma to make their characters appealing but the film does give Bullock the opportunity to give an impressive physical performance on the level of Naomi Watts in The Impossible (2012). This is also the best of Bullock's two Academy Award nominated performances as while she is legitimately atrocious in The Blind Side (2009) she excels here.\n\nI can't say, despite how excellent this film is in many ways, that this is one of my favorite films of 2013 and the fact that I never found myself completely emotionally engaged means that I don't think it is the masterpiece that some believe it to be.",

How sexist is that?\n\nYes the science is realistic, but the movie is pure crap. It only works because the lead is female and everyone can accept a lady being sniffling and useless and being prone to breakdowns.\n\nIf the lead role was male, you'd have a useless guy crying and being untrained and unprepared for everything in space. Oh right, they would have never casted a guy in such a role.\n\nJust like how no one would have ever sent a weak minded lady like the lead character up into space. \n\nWhat an insult to all space agencies. To all women as well. ",

There were times in this movie where I was seriously terrified at what was happening to our protagonist. She was thrown into harrowing situations and when you really think about what she goes through, it√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM)s frightening. Cuaron makes sure it comes across like that on screen. It helps that this is visually stunning. Everything we see looks breathtaking and so vast. Some of the camera shots are incredible. Seriously, this was absolutely the right choice to win Best Cinematography at the Academy Awards. For something like this to work, the acting has to also be on point. Sandra Bullock (Dr. Ryan Stone) is outstanding. It√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM)s some of the best work of her career, right up there with The Blind Side. George Clooney (Lt. Matt Kowalski) is also fantastic and they play well off each other. It√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM)s some natural chemistry that makes some of their more generic conversations all the more entertaining. I lastly want to credit the score. It really helps set the tone for the movie, yet is never overdone and doesn√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM)t overshadow things.\n\nWeaknesses: I wasn√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM)t too big on the scene where Stone hallucinates and sees Kowalski. It feels kind of cheap and cheesy. I get that she needs her moment where she√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM)s at her lowest, but I think there were better ways to get there. For her to just see him and instantly have the answer on how to get back to Earth feels kind of lame. Though I don√Ø¬ø 1/2(TM)t know much about traveling and surviving in space, there are more than a few moments in this that feel far-fetched.\n\nOverall: With fantastic work from the two lead actors and the director, it is almost impossible for this not to be great. It has a few issues, but this was worth all the hype it got when it originally came out.",

            "content": "- Gravity is truly an out of body and space experience. -\n\nI have always enjoyed Sandra Bullock (The Blind Side). She's never annoyed me like she annoys other people. Oh actually, she was a nightmare in All About Steve, but that is the one exception. So when I walked into the cinema to watch Gravity a couple of years ago, I was comfortable with watching Bullock for a good 91 minutes. What I didn't realize was that I would be seeing her at her absolute best. Gravity is her magnum opus, her crowning jewel, her chef d'oeuvre.\n\nI know that sci-fi movies can put some people off. They're not everybody's cup of tea. But this movie isn't really a classic sci-fi and it's not about space just as the movie Arrival wasn't really about Aliens. They're both really about grieving women trying to get through each day.\n\nBullock plays Ryan Stone. She's a mother dealing with adversity, loss and an overpowering sense of loneliness. She lives for her job as a medical engineer in outer space.\n\nStone and Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney (Up in the Air) are working on the exterior of their spacecraft when disaster strikes and their shuttle is destroyed. And when disaster strikes in outer space, well, there's absolutely nothing you can do about it really.\n\nStone and Kowalski are trapped by their isolation. They float away from the station and Earth, and as each minute passed, I felt like I was floating out into space with them. In one scene, Stone floats and spins slowly in a circle. I remember vividly leaning over to my friend and saying \"she looks like a fetus in a womb.\" The whole movie is a metaphor for rebirth. I was in a cinema packed full of people and yet I felt incredibly vulnerable and alone.\n\nI believe Gravity is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The cinematic theme of a woman's grief isn't at all unique, but the solitude in which she experiences it in Gravity absolutely is. The infinity of space expanded the depth of the story's intimacy to the farthest expanses of the Universe. The movie is about silence. It's about waiting for someone to save you when you know that ultimately, only you can save yourself.\n\nSandra Bullock stripped herself to the barest nuance to play the role of her grieving character. Stone is sharp and brutal. She isn't the warmest person in the world or space. Her caustic nature controls her actions, her communication and her willingness to survive.\n\nThe fascinating thing about Gravity, the thing that really pulled me into the core of Stone's isolation and fear, was the use of sound. There was almost none. Most blockbusters rely on pulling your heartstrings with big orchestral pieces or pounding scores but Gravity sat in the silence. It was breathtaking and often heartbreaking.\n\nGravity also confirmed the importance of VMAX and IMAX cinemas for me. The first movie ever shown in a cinema of people in 1896 had a scene where a train plowed toward the screen. The audience was so certain that the train was going to hit them, that they jumped out of their seats to avoid it. I had the same experience when the debris from the broken spacecraft was hurtling at me in Gravity 3-D. I ducked in my seat. I don't think there is anything more powerful in cinema than when a movie makes you fear for your physical well being.\n\nSo I know what I'm about to say next makes me a bit of a freak. I am not a fan of George Clooney. I know. He's a dreamboat. But a good actor? Meh. However, his acting is lifted in Gravity because of one thing, Sandra Bullock. She guides Clooney in this movie and elevates his performance.\n\nThere are movies that entertain us, that make us laugh, cry and everything in between. But Gravity transported me from this Earth for 91 minutes. For those 91 minutes, I was flying. What an absolute gift the experience was.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://narrativemuse.co/movies/gravity, and was written by Jules Raynes.

The setting is spectacular and the premise is inventive.\n\nOn every other front,the movie falters badly. Once you get over the initial wonderment surrounding the beautiful visuals, the chinks start showing up. Overall the script is very weak. Apparently the Russians bomb their own satellite by mistake and the debris is flying around at bullet speed, smashing everything in its way. Now upon hearing an emergency evacuation request, Kowalski (who has been wasting his precious thrusters all this while, floating around, spouting inane dialogs) orders Ryan (Bullock) to disengage from whatever she is repairing. Apparently Ryan has six months of training (only) and fails to be responsive and then the trouble starts.\n\nWe come to know that Ryan has some head issues surrounding the death of her daughter as the writer felt a dire need to give Ryan some sort of existential problem in her head to make her character feel more human. Apart from this minor bit, nothing is presented in terms of character development for any other protagonists. Who is Kowalski? Who are the people who died in their space pods? No idea.\n\nThen the whole manufactured sense of suspense. Every time Ryan gets anywhere near the Air Lock (she does it three times), the debris presents itself like on cue every single time. Then a fire in a space station, then running out of Oxygen, then something then something. It's fine that they used some standard tricks but it all seems so manufactured and mechanical by the numbers suspense.\n\nAlso at times I couldn't shrug off the feeling that what they are showing on screen is not actually factual. Do the controls on various international space stations have their national languages on them? Really? Maybe they do but seems hard to believe when 20$ phones are built with custom User interfaces with changeable languages, why have your billion dollar space stations with Russian or Chinese characters on your buttons totally beats me. Oh manufactured suspense owing to the whole can't-understand-this-thing machinery.\n\nThe the dialogs when they come are nothing to write home about. Ryan has a hallucinatory moment when she talks to herself following some Mandarin Chatter on the radio which is cringe worthy. I wont even mention the in-your-face allegory about rebirth which is there for to make the movie seem deeper than it is.\n\nSo what works for the movie? It's a cross between an IMAX documentary with some suspense elements thrown it which makes it look path breaking.\n\nBut it's not. Not a bad watch but nothing to rave about either.First of all there is NOTHING I repeat NOTHING that warrants the cost of a 3D ticket.\n\nSecond, this movie is boring and overly predictable.\n\nThird, there is nothing in this movie that makes you want to care that suddenly this \"mission specialist\" played by Bullock is stuck up in space alone.\n\nFourth, where points could have been made to make you want to care about anyone in the movie they don't bother. Clooney's character keeps telling \"Mission Control\" stories for the most part that they've heard about his life. We haven't heard them and you never do. His character is only concerned about getting a record for the longest un-tethered space walk.\n\nFifth, Bullocks character acts like a buffoon. She \"claims\" to only have had 6 months of training. Based on what she says she would have been disqualified due to her questionable mental state after (years before)her daughter dies from some play ground accident at her day care. Now I like Sandra Bullock, but this performance is not worthy of an Oscar at all.\n\nSixth, She \"magically\" makes(this is because she spent over 5 minutes breathing in pure carbon monoxide, if this had been real she'd be dead) it to the Russian Soius Space capsule. She then using pictures in books can magically use buttons in Russian capsule to make it work, though claimed she trained on the simulator for them, she still needs the books to operate these things. She then \"magically\" get an empty fueled Soius capsule over to the Chinese station. Which is identical to the Soviet but in Chinese instead (this is probably fact as China bought their space station tech from Russia)and again using picture books she gets the thing to work.\n\nSeventh, Drama and suspense, WHERE, you are told that the satellite debris will be around ever 90 minutes, the astronauts set their timers for the count down so again that's NEVER a surprise not only that, it's camera shot debris coming, look at watch. NO suspense.\n\nEighth, The ending, Specialist Ryan escapes in the Chinese capsule and gets back to earth, crashes in to the water and you are left with her walking on the beach. That's it you just wasted 100 minutes for this pointless that could be done in 30 minutes.\n\nNOT worth your time or money.Arguably the best tagline for a movie EVER, \"In space no one can hear you scream\" Alien's \"In space no one can hear you scream\" tagline is arguably the best tagline for a movie of all-time. That same tagline could easily be effectively utilized for Alfonso Cuar√≥n's latest thriller, Gravity.\n\nStarring two unknowns by the names of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, Gravity puts the two A-listers together as a medical engineer and an astronaut that must work in tandem to survive once a freak accident leaves them adrift in space.\n\nTheir struggle takes place after debris from a Russian satellite comes speeding through their orbit ripping their space shuttle to shreds causing Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) to float untethered in space. Coming to her aid is astronaut Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) who estimates that the debris will again circle the earth and again zip past their location in approximately 90-minutes. Their mission quickly changes into a race to survival 600km above the earth where help from anyone outside of each other is impossible.\n\nAlfonso Cuar√≥n is chiselling himself quite a career. He was last behind the camera for Children of Men (2006) which was nominated for three Academy Awards and he was also responsible for the best film in the Harry Potter film series with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). But Gravity is his best work to date.\n\nBullock carries the film (expect some murmurs for a Best Actress nomination) and Gravity centers on the two main characters only. There are no other developed characters. Two other astronauts and a radio voice from Houston, Texas are the only other character influences and their parts wouldn't amount to 2 minutes if strung in order.\n\nWith only two actors to carry the entire 90-minute runtime, the movie relies heavily on its visuals of space and the various orbiting stations with the earth always prominent in the background. And the visuals are fantastic. There are no side-stories, sub-plots, unnecessary fluff or sexual tension between the characters. Just a desperate attempt to make the most of the oxygen they have left.\n\nGravity is the best 3D film ever. Ever. Add to the mix the incredible visuals and perfect sound (both loud and quiet) and you have a faultless mix. Gravity will contend for Oscar's in Visual Effects, Sound and Editing.\n\nCuar√≥n incredibly is able to give his audience a sense of claustrophobia whether his cast are inside an orbiting capsule or in the vast darkness of space. And as the astronauts deal with each new developing tragedy, the audience will themselves be gasping for air rooting for the character's success in each new attempt at survival.\n\nWith still a few months left in the year, it's too early to call a film the year's best. But Gravity will definitely be there on many lists at the year's conclusion. It's that breathtaking. It's that good.\nAs a quick cap on, this film is a survival film about an astronaut, played by Sandra Bullock, who is stuck in space after a catastrophe happens that ends her mission in space and strands her without any help on the way. That is the basis. It is directed by Alfonso Cauron, and his direction is much needed in this eye-candy film.\n\nAlfonso Cuaron is a fantastic director. His work on the Prisoner of Azkaban and Children of Men, the latter in particular, is nothing short of phenomenal. The long take, the attention to detail in the fore and back ground, all are a joy to see in films that have more to see each time you watch them. This is no different. There are moments where we move in and out of an astronaut's visor to get in and out of their traumatic experience, all within the fluidity of his signature long take, amongst gorgeous visuals.\n\nVisually too this film scores very well. The images of Earth from space, the explosions, of which there are many I will unashamedly spoil, are similarly exhilarating to see. I had the downside of viewing the film on a 2D home TV. I got the impression that 3D would have been better for a viewing of the film, but it was still easy to appreciate the effort that went into the visual aspects of Gravity. The atmosphere from the visuals were very effective consequently and a joy to look at. Added to this atmosphere was a very effective and electronic score by Steven Price, that helped to enhance the film.\n\nHowever, the film had glaring flaws that made apparent all the effort of the film's production went into the visuals. Foremost was the story. It was threadbare, and with 40 minutes to go, I stopped watching the film as I felt I had experienced all it had to offer. The films only substantial plot twist had occurred before this point, and so the films climactic ending was very predictable. Worse, the plot revolved entirely around something going wrong, and Sandra Bullock seeking a solution. This happens several times and by half way through, it felt repetitive and eye-rolling.\n\nThe characters were similarly dull. There are 5 characters in the film, of which 3 have a very small appearance, and so really there is only Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. This is all fine; there are many films that nail 2 people casts by granting them compelling and complex personalities that you care about. However, neither George nor Sandra had interesting characters. George played the intelligent heroic figure; Sandra the damsel in distress, who appeared to be woefully unprepared emotionally and technically for a specialist mission in space, and spent the majority of the film panicking.\n\nThe characters were frustratingly one dimensional, left very revealing by the lacking script. Clooney had practically no backstory, and had absolutely no depth to his character. Clooney and Bullock both did their best with the roles, but the difficulty of such simple characters made their job acting hard. This heavily detracted from the overall experience of the film, because the interest I got in the film from the visuals and directing style was heavily reduced by the plot, script and characters, to the extent that I didn't finish it.\n\nPersonally I am very surprised at the reception this film has got by critics and the voters on IMDb alike. I went into this film expecting a thriller that was also good. I finished the film without reaching its conclusion, with the impression that it was well produced, but not well made. Alfonso did very well, but he made a graphical presentation, not a film.",

The visuals look amazing and it still has it's fair share of tense moments and scenes that look awesome in 3D. However, I find this movie to be extremely overrated. Don't get me wrong, Alfonso Cuar√≥n is not a bad director as I highly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban but I was expecting more. I think it's because of the mistake of not watching this movie in 3D since it makes the first-person sequences more tense. I really wanted to enjoy this movie and I know a lot of people loved it but my feelings are more mixed towards the movie especially since Interstellar took my breath away and nearly made me cry and The Martian was the best intentional comedy that wasn't even categorized as one of 2015 alongside Ant-Man with lovely cinematography and tons of education about botany. The 90-minute long runtime meant that this would be a fast-paced adventure yet the pacing was a little too fast for me with George Clooney feeling, to me, like an advertised extra in his own movie where Sandra Bullock is the protagonist. For a movie that's science fiction it doesn't really have that sci-fi feel to it. The Martian had the excuse of being set in 2035 with the possible technology that might be invented around that same time whilst Interstellar's story involved three possibly fictitious planets. I think the term \"science fiction\" feels out of place in this movie. It's also the least scientifically accuate out of the three. It's meant to be touching but after witnessing Matthew McConaughhey see through one-way Skype cry when seeing his children having grown up into Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck, I find myself disappointed by the drama. So, sadly, I don't like Gravity as much as you do and I regret never getting the chance to see it in 3D though it's visuals and Sandra Bullock's performance along with a few tense scenes still barely manage to save the day.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, after all those summer lightweight movies, it s time for something heavy.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Gravity will definitely keep you in your seat.\n\nSCOTT: Gravity certainly begins with a bang. Literally. Astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) are conducting routine repairs outside their orbiting space shuttle when they are told by mission command that a Russian space accident is sending high-speed shrapnel their way. The shrapnel destroys their shuttle, killing three of their crew, while Stone is detached from her line and is sent spinning in space, alone and running out of oxygen.\n\nGREG: Kowalski retrieves Stone but with the shuttle in ruins they realize their only hope is to make their way to the orbiting International Space Station where a Soyuz spacecraft awaits as an escape pod. They estimate they have only 90 minutes before the orbiting debris field returns for another hack at them. The race is on as Kowalski tethers Stone to his jetpack and they traverse the emptiness of space for the ISS. Scott, this was a visually stunning movie. I saw it in IMAX 3D and I could not have been more impressed. The movie makers understood the physics and silence of space and played it to full effect. The destruction scene where Stone spins off into space is just mesmerizing. The backdrop of the entire movie is a beautiful panorama of the Earth as seen from space. Gravity is a breathtaking visual feast from beginning to end.\n\nSCOTT: I totally agree, Greg. Gravity is one of those well-crafted movies that grabs our attention and holds it easily for 90 minutes. The film is able to convey the wonder and awe of being a mere human in the vastness of space. There are many magnificent shots of the earth and its ethereal beauty, often reflected exquisitely on the astronauts  facemasks. The movie s strength is its supreme simplicity. There are only two characters, and we come to know them and like them quite well. We should not underestimate Sandra Bullock s stellar performance here. I m reminded of Tom Hanks  work in Castaway in which he carries scene after scene, alone, frightened, and resourceful. Bullock strikes the right charismatic balance between portraying both terror and charm. I was impressed.\n\nGREG: Sandra Bullock has a long history of choosing strong female roles. From 2000 s Miss Congeniality, to 2009 s The Blind Side and even this summer s The Heat, Bullock looks for roles that play to her strengths and to the strength of her female lead character. Gravity is no exception. Bullock s Dr. Stone starts out very self-occupied. She isn t at ease in space. We learn that she s never gotten over the accidental death of her 4-year-old daughter. In many ways, Stone is just going through the paces of her life. She avoids contact with other people. But through this harrowing adventure she discovers her inner strength and comes to closure with her inner demons.\n\nSCOTT: Exactly. As in any good movie, we witness a commendable character transformation in our hero. Stone develops a confidence and a resourcefulness that she lacks at the outset of the film. And we can be sure that she is forever changed by her experiences. Stone is a terrific female hero, a nice change of pace from the disproportionate number of male heroes in movies today. I do have a few nitpicks. Although George Clooney did a fine job is his role, I wish that his character had been a woman. This would have allowed Stone to become transformed without the help of a man, as the last thing we need is a film telling us that women cannot be heroes without male assistance. My other quibbles center on Stone taking far too much time to save herself when her oxygen was running low, as well as a scene in which one member of the crew seemed to untether himself from a life-line unnecessarily. I can forgive these oversights because on the whole, Gravity is a quality movie experience.\n\nGREG: Gravity is also one of the most visually appealing movies Ive ever seen. The movie makers used new technology to film the weightless aspects of outer space without resorting to the  Vomit Comet.   They did a great job of giving the impression that we are spinning around helplessly in zero-G.  I compare it to such films as 1968s 2001: A Space Odyssey and 1999s The Matrix in terms of innovation. I fully expect Oscar nods for this film. The Heros Journey is fully realized as well. Clooney as the veteran space walker plays the mentor to Bullock s Stone. All the important plot points were hit at just the right times. Gravity clocks in at just 90 minutes but it felt like it went a lot faster. I was constantly on the edge of my seat worrying about what Stone was going to do next. My limited knowledge of physics was not offended by this film. I did notice a couple of plot devices that were improbable (for example, one would find a trip from the Hubble Telescope to the International Space Station a bit more difficult than we see here). But that did not impact my enjoyment of the experience. Gravity is a masterfully made movie that transported me from the safety of my theater seat to the treacherous void of space. I was captivated by the story and I felt every bit of the hero s journey with Dr. Stone. For completely immersing me in a classic story of escape and even redemption, I give Gravity 5 out of 5 Reels.  Sandra Bullock s portrayal of an ordinary person in the extraordinary situation of working her way home from a distant shore was heroic and personal. I give her 5 Heroes out of 5. Movie:   Hero:\n\nSCOTT: I did enjoy Gravity and will most likely include it in my top-10 movie list for 2013, but I wouldn t go so far as to call it as classic film or a groundbreaking film.  Gravity is an excellent, suspenseful movie that will leave you rooting for and cheering for a hero who overcomes the odds, along with her inner demons, to survive a catastrophic space accident. I highly recommend this movie and happily award it 4 Reels out of 5. The hero story has most of the classic elements and earns top honors from me in the form of 5 Heroes out of 5. Movie: Hero:",

            "content": "Gravity\nAlfonso Quar√≥n's, Gravity was an unending thrill-ride, in which the thrill literally lasted until the final minutes of the movie. Before everything turned into a chaos for our protagonist, the first 10 minutes were smartly used for some slight character development, and also as a \"calm before the storm\" buildup before the non-stop suspense starts to take place. It doesn't go to deep into side character development, since it is not necessary. Throughout the movie we almost only get to follow the main protagonist.\n\nThe protagonist doesn't only have to fight to survive, but she also has to fight to get the will to survive. After losing her daughter in an accident, she didn't have much willpower left. She was given multiple opportunities to give up, but instead she keeps fighting. As soon as she makes the deliberate decision to live, she seems relieved, almost happy. Though, it did not end there, there was still a lot ahead of her.\n\nThere are some incredibly meaningful scenes in this movie that are suggesting metaphors, which gives the movie more meaning than just being an intense thrill-ride. One of the most distinctive scene's is when Sandra Bullock floats around in a fetal position, with what looks like an umbilical cord behind her. This points at rebirth, which seems even more fitting when it's out in space, away from all society (rebirth in space has been done before, very literally in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey). Another scene suggesting rebirth is the movie's ending scene, in which Bullock crawls out of a lake (this scene you're going to have to see for yourself). There's more to read about this in an interview io9 did with Cuar√≥n as the movie was released (check bottom for link).\n\nGravity's post-production editing is beyond words (it really deserved all of the 7 Oscars it won). The film's outstanding cinematography combined with Sandra Bullock's impressive performance (she won a well-deserved Oscar for \"Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role\"), and also some seemingly fitting dark humor, made the most out an already amazing plot. Gravity was an amazing suspenseful movie, with an even deeper meaning!\n\nInterview: http://io9.gizmodo.com/gravitys-ending-holds-a-deeper-meaning-says-alfonso-c-1442690788\n\n/Leonard",

            "content": "Space, the endless emptiness that holds many wonders and anomalies. It's been the setting for hundreds of movies through the years. In fact many masterpieces have been set in space:¬†Stanley Kubrick's ground breaking 2001: A Space Odyssey, Ridley Scott's terrifying Alien and Pixar's animated feature Wall-E. Then came 2013, a year that seemed to be full of standard summer blockbusters and a few indie films...just like any other year. But in the fall, critics went crazy. \"Nothing could ever beat Avatar, visually\" they all said, including myself...but i was wrong. The behemoth that took the cinema by storm came out...Gravity.¬†I remember being so excited going to the cinema to watch this, I went on release day with my family. After the film finished, I was on the edge of my seat...sweating with my eyes widened at what I just saw. From that moment, I¬†knew this was the greatest thing I ever watched.\n\nFor a film that consists of essentially 4 actors (3 of them on screen and 1 voice actor), I was completely engaged and convinced that I was with those characters. Sandra Bullock was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for her role but it was tough year and unfortunately did not win, but the nomination alone just shows how incredible she was. George Clooney was witty, comedic and re-assuring as the most experienced astronaut in the group. The chemistry between Bullock and Clooney was brilliant, given the circumstance of what happens during the film. This overall however is Bullock's film, she has the most screen time and has to convey the emotions of what she is going through by herself...and also inform the viewers what is happening etc.\n¬†\nAlfonso Cuar√≥n, who also directed the underrated Children of Men, takes directing duties for Gravity and is absolutely outstanding. I mean the first shot of the film is all one take and goes on for 10 minutes. The man is a genius when it comes to controlling the camera, so many great one take shots which just shows the confidence he has in order to pull them off. He balances the dialogue with the thrills perfectly so that it never becomes boring. The fact he won the Oscar for best director just proves all of this. Emmanuel Lubezki is the cinematographer and also won the Oscar for best cinematography for this movie (deservedly so!). There is also one scene where the camera moves slowly towards bullock's character and then (still in the same shot) goes through her helmet to see her point-of-view...it's just genius.¬†Cuar√≥n also wrote the script with his brother, and managed to bring in emotion, courage and humour within the 91 minute runtime.\n\nIn space, you cannot hear anything. Gravity does something very clever in which we hear the sounds of space through the space suits, so if a character touches something that is shaking we as the viewers hear the reverb through the suit. It's this kind of sound editing that makes this an enthralling experience, especially when viewing with surround sound. Steven Price is the composer and also won the Oscar for original score. The soundtrack to this film is masterful, in fact one scene towards the end is so epic because of the composition behind it...really gets your heart racing.\n¬†\nThe star of the film however are the visual effects, never has space looked so good! The detail of Earth in the background and the sun shining in the distance is breathtaking. Even during scenes of intense explosions with pieces of metal flying around, it's just sublime to look at. The way they filmed this was to have Bullock and Clooney in an LED light box and then add the visual effects in after (all done by a British team of visual effect experts). This is one of the few films designed for 3D viewing and I can honestly say it is on par with Avatar for best 3D effects. The ultimate way to view this film is in 3D so if you get the chance, don't blink twice...just watch it!\n¬†\nWhat else is there to say? Gravity is my favourite film of all time, everyone who knows me knows that I adore this film, I physically cannot find a flaw. It's a masterpiece. Unfortunately it's a film that a lot of people like to hate and sure everyone has their opinions, but hating a film just because it's highly rated is not an excuse. So if you haven't seen Gravity, go out to the shop, but the 3D Blu-ray, but a massive TV with surround sound and enjoy it. No thanks necessary, you are all very welcome!\n\n- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",

Alfonso Cuar√≥n's Gravity provides an exciting and emotional adventure in the far reaches of Earth's atmosphere unlike any I've experienced before. Gravity focuses on two astronauts, played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, as their Space Shuttle mission is torn apart (literally) by an orbiting field of space debris. The rest of the film focuses on their struggle to survive in the silent, zero-gravity, and zero-oxygen environment above earth. The main standouts in the film are the performances by the main (and only) actors, Bullock and Clooney (but did anyone catch Ed Harris' voice as Mission Control?). Bullock's performance is especially good: her portrayal of a scared, vulnerable amateur astronaut is believable, emotionally compelling, and empowering. And while Clooney's performance as a fatherlike, veteran astronaut is easily overshadowed by his co-star's, he also does a great job. The visual effects in the film also deserve praise, because as far as I could tell, the majority of Gravity was actually filmed in space. The above-earth shots are impressive and dazzling, and the scene of the destruction of the International Space Station stood out as some of the thriller's finest eye-candy. Aside from that, the screenplay and script, the beautiful cinematography, the soundtrack (which is sometimes non-existent to emphasize the silence of space), and the story are all spectacular. Gravity defines itself as one of the best thrillers, dramas, and space adventures to ever set foot in the film industry, and it, along with its brilliant director, deserves a thunderous round of applause.",

A strong cast all round and with Cuar√≥n on board, it's no surprise that the film is beautifully-shot too. The film is fully-convincing- it feels like you're in space as you watch it. Not just because the visual effects are realistic and because the film must have cost a bajillion dollars to make but, more importantly, because it makes you feel small. Every detail works in this way- from the set pieces to the sound design. It all succeeds in making the viewer feel what it's like to be stuck out in space. \n\nEverything is on track for a brilliant film then but what about the plot? Well, it's not exactly ground-breaking in that sense as 'space disaster' can only really go so many ways. With that being said, however, 'Gravity' has an ace up its sleeve when it comes to its story. Yes, it's a tense thriller set in space but it's a drama first, and a very human one at that (no space aliens here, folks).\n\nThis isn't a space movie for the sake of it, the setting exists to further the emotions that the film looks at and it very much succeeds at doing this. As we learn about Stone we are put in her shoes- she is trapped in space, but she's even more trapped in her own head, the isolation that she feels outside of Earth is only a reminder of the isolation that she felt back on Earth too. \n\nThis is a space blockbuster- it didn't need to tackle weighty themes or pack real emotional depth. It could have just been action packed and formulaic but instead it lets its characters breathe (poor wording, eh?) and it ends up carrying real, well, gravity, because of it. \n\nThe film is pretty concise and never feels at risk of drudging on but, I really wanted more. I feel that there was so much to work with that to tell the whole story in just an hour and a half was too fast. Maybe it's selfish of me to want more, however, as 'Gravity' still met every one of my expectations, and then some.",

            "content": "To be able to generate the amount of hype for a two character movie is one thing, to live up to it is quite another thing altogether. Alfonso Cuaron's thrilling space saga achieves just that. Though I wouldn't rate this big as a compelling drama, it more than compensates with its spectacular set pieces and jaw dropping visuals achieved through precise use of 3D technology. Even the drama quotient had its moments leveraging on more than capable Sandra Bullock's intense portrayal of a lonely stranded astronaut who has lost her way and hope but not ready to give up. \n\nRyan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer who is on her first trip to space along with the smooth talking veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney). When a Russian satellite is hit by a missile, the fast flying debris hits their explorer shuttle and drifts the two further into space. It now becomes a race against time to reach a nearby space station, get into an escape pod and reach Earth. \n\nWhile the movie gives a very satisfying visual experience with the leads charismatic and intense portrayal complementing each other quite well, the story as a whole leaves a lot to be desired and believable. Hopping into different space stations, reading through manuals and controlling the systems all made to look quite easy. [SPOILER] Letting go of Matt's character that easily did not make any sense for the following obvious reasons - 1) He is full of life and wouldn't part with his life that easily for someone he just met. 2) They have no clear way of knowing the tensile strength of the string they are hung on. 3) They don't even attempt to save him before deciding. \nBy not showing any other character on Earth with just some distorted voice signals, the director manages to create that eery atmosphere of loneliness which Sandra Bullock took it to another level. The use of latest and smartest use of 3D technology made me feel like I was in space for a moment especially when Ryan was rolling away in space, it was through Ryan POV and it made for a horrifying yet thrilling view. Like the director's superior 'Children of Men', the relentless and continuous action sequences and a restless screenplay doesn't let you ponder about its logic until it is done.\n\nAmazing while you watch, fizzles out a bit when you think back",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Alfonso Cuarons Gravity, in dem Astronauten ein technisches Desaster bew√§ltigen m√ºssen, ist ein gewaltiger Film! Technisch umwerfend gemacht und grandios erz√§hlt! W√§hrend ich Sandra Bullck und George Clooney bei der Arbeit zusehe, kann ich mir sogar ausmalen, wie die ersten Blockbuster wohl auf den Zuschauer gewirkt haben m√ºssen, wie sie ihn schwindelig gemacht haben! So gings mir beim Anblick dieser freischwebenden Astronauten, die auch noch so liebenswert sind! Das tollste an Gravity ist aber gar nicht seine Gr√∂sse und Spannung, sondern dass dieser Film ein Herz hat! Eigentlich gehts gar nicht prim√§r um Astronauten oder eine Katastrophe, im Grunde ist das hier die Hightech Fassung eines √úberlebensfilms. Wir werden direkt mit den Gef√ºhlen der Hauptfiguren konfrontiert: Das hier ist ein Film dar√ºber, was mit unserer Psyche geschieht, in dem Moment, da der K√∂rper einer Katastrophe ausgesetzt wird - und in diese Gef√ºhle der Figuren tauchen wir ganz tief ein! Bullocks Dr. Ryan Stone ist zum ersten Mal im All unterwegs, Clooneys Matt Kowalski ein alter Hase. Nachdem ein Tr√ºmmer ihr Teleskop zerst√∂rt hat, finden sich beide wieder verloren im All. Stone muss nun alles lernen von ihrem erfahrenen Partner, jeden Trick, den es zum √úberleben braucht. \"Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission\", gibt Kowalski durch. Der Satz ist ein Muss f√ºr diese Art von Film! In den H√§nden eines weniger tollen Geschichtenerz√§hlers, w√§re Gravity zur blossen Angeberei verkommen. Cuaron aber, der das Drehbuch mit seinem Sohn schrieb, schafft es, gemeinsam mit dem gr√∂ssten Kameramann unserer Zeit, Emmanuel Lubezki, uns hier jeden Moment sp√ºrbar werden zu lassen. Was auch immer Stone und Kowalski tun, wir fiebern mit, ja wir SIND sie! Viele Videokunden meinten, der Film sei zu mystisch, zu melodramatisch, zu simpel oder zu irgendwas... Ich finde Gravity grossartig! Ich kann den Machern einfach nur f√ºr dieses Erlebnis, diese Pr√§zision und Sch√∂nheit danken, mit der sie Gravity geschaffen haben! Ich denke nicht, dass der Film versucht, einen grossen philosophischen Wurf zu landen. Die Geschichte ist einfach, die Bilder komplex. Die meisten Szenen wirken so sparsam wie am Theater: Die Figuren reden miteinander und langsam lernen wir sie kennen. Eine ganze Weile lang traut Cuaron Sandra Bullock eine One Woman Show zu. Es ist einer der gr√∂ssten physischen Auftritte, die ich bisher sah und jeder Moment blieb lange h√§ngen bei mir. Ihre Gestik und wie sie die Gef√ºhle mit ihrem Gesicht offenbart, z√§hlt zu den ganz grossen schauspielerischen Leistungen und verdient Vergleiche mit Klassikern der Stummfilm-√Ñra! Fragt mich nun jemand, wovon Gravity handelt, w√ºrde ich antworten, dass es ein Weltraumabenteuer ist. Verloren im All. Wenn er den Film dann sieht, wird er merken, um was es wirklich geht. Das treffendste Wort, Gravity zu beschreiben: Der Film gleicht einem Grab. Einem Ort, an dem alles endet. Der Film handelt von dem Moment, da du denkst, nun sei alles vorbei unwiderbringlich - doch dann stirbst du doch nicht! Warum hast du trotz dieser Aussichtslosigkeit entschieden, weiter zu k√§mpfen? Ich denke, dass ist eine der grossen Fragen des Menschseins.",

Suddenly, things go bad, and then go from bad to worse, and then from worse to \"Your Life Sucks Right Now.\" Through it all, they must over come adversity, the harshness of space, and strange physics that do not follow the rules discovered by our Earth scientists.\n\nAs the film progresses, though, the scenarios feel more and more contrived. It's almost as if the film could have been done in 15 minutes, but nobody would pay $14.99 to go see it at that length, so they had to try and come up with new scenarios. It worked in The Martian; it doesn't work here.\n\nTo make matters worse, this film is basically Man of Steel in space. Tons of needless destruction, disaster at every turn. While it is not as ham-fisted as the latest Michael Bay film, it definitely detracts from the narrative.\n\nClooney and Bullock play their parts well, with Clooney bringing a great attitude to his character.

            "content": "\"I hate space.\"\n\nThat quote represents a brief moment of levity in Gravity, an otherwise harrowing thriller, and it perfectly sums up its lead character, rookie spacewalker Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock). The film itself-or at least the stakes from which every bit of tension is derived-is better summarized by a quote that comes earlier in the film. Just seconds in, white text on an all black screen tells us \"Life in space is impossible.\" That it is.\n\nGravity's premise is simple: After being showered with debris, Stone is separated from her shuttle and her crew. She's literally floating through space-spinning without direction or control-until her crewmate, Lt. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), catches up with her (he was luckily attached to a jet pack when disaster struck). The two of them, tethered together, head for the safe confines of the Explorer, but must come up with a new plan when they find it completely destroyed.\n\nThe simplicity of the premise allows Cuaron and his fellow screenwriter/son, Jonas, to come up with creative-and visually unparalleled-examples of space-set masochism. That is to say the Cuarons throw mountains of trouble at Kowalski and Stone-rapidly depleting supplies of oxygen, fires, broken equipment, and debris storms that occur at regular 90-minute intervals.\n\nAnd none of this is counting for the emotional component that comes with fighting for one's life hundreds of miles above the surface of the Earth. There will be those who feel Stone's backstory and eventual growth is hackeneyed, and those individuals wouldn't necessarily be wrong. But there's something comforting about this special effects feast's familiarity. Gravity is an intense experience that will glue you to your chair. Without attempting to engage you on something other than a visceral level would be mistake and would make this film colder than its setting. Hem and haw if you must about the bluntness of it all (the 3D tear floating at you, for example), but I was completely taken by Stone and her story.\n\nIt helps, of course, when you have a fine actress in top form. Sandra Bullock has literally never been better than she is here. One can only imagine the physical demands of the performance, but she's also alone on screen for LONG periods of time. While she and Clooney (who's his usual charming self) are tethered together, she's reserved, frightened, and resigned to her fate (the quote that opened this review really does say a lot about this woman). But once they part ways, she empowers herself to beat the odds, and that change is one of the film's most satisfying elements.\n\nBut the star of the film, as you might expect, is the elder Cuaron. It's been seven years since his last (the incomparable Children of Men), and in that time, he invented technology to make Gravity work. Not content to set his tendency for long takes aside, he deemed Apollo 13's zero-gravity style too constraining to work with. It's a decision that's impossible to argue with given the results. Gravity is perhaps the best-looking movie ever set in space, and those long takes-the ones that dropped jaws throughout Children of Men-are look even better on the biggest scale.\n\nSome credit belongs to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, of course. It's great to know the man seems primed to finally take home a well-deserved Oscar. But Gravity's achievement is more than any number of gold statues could state. It's a piece of smart, entertaining, and original filmmaking that studios simply don't go for in today's marketplace-especially when said film has a budget on par with that of Gravity-and it's the best case for 3D filmmaking we've seen so far (Avatar and Hugo included). I can't say how well Gravity will play on your television-but the theatergoing experience was one of the best I've had in years and one I'll remember for years to come.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/gravity-review/",

This is not only because are the visuals and score etc are so stunning and awe-inspiring, but also because we have suprisingly excllent performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, who manage make it personal and play these roles with conviction, and the changing emotions you might expect. \nOn that note, this movie constantly flits moods and emotions, which is why it doesn't drag or bore (when it easily could have) and just when you think 's okay, something always happens to catch you off guard, maintaining the tension perfectly.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The sheer tension and bleakness does take away some of the potential for emotion - you don't neccessarily feel sympathy towards the characters, more for the situation itself, but this is still thanks to great acting \nVERDICT: It's nothing sort of bloody amazing. Gravity is a bleak, scary, brilliant space adventure like no other. Just wow.",

The dizzying spins, angles, and views of Earth would've been spectacular on the big screen.\n\nI was surprised at how few actors there actually were in this. It was primarily about Sandra Bullock's impressively fit character Dr. Ryan Stone, surviving catastrophic destruction of her team's spacecraft along with losing her entire team. For a while, she is accompanied by Matt Kowalski played by George Clooney.\n \nWhile Stone struggles to cope with the situation, Kowalski remains upbeat and confident. Stone goes through some emotional ups and downs as she fights to survive. We never see weakness in Kowalski for the short time he is with her. Even as he stares death in the face, he's as positive, upbeat, and \"we're going to do this\" as you can possibly get. Is it just me or would he make a great dad? Your little league team might be losing badly but somehow he'll still make you feel like a winner.\n\nWhen Kowalski decides he needs to sacrifice himself so that Stone can live, Stone disagrees. I agreed with Stone; my reaction was: \"Wait, no, don't do it; you'll both make it!\" But, sadly, he disconnects. Oh, wow. So this is about one astronaut surviving, alone, against all odds. \n\nOne close call after another keeps the tension going. \n\nThe visit Stone experienced by Kowalski after he had most likely died was an interesting twist and brought another element to the story. In many real life stories where people are pushed to the edges in difficult survival situations, they later report they survived because they were visited by a deceased loved one or person of significance who provided support or guidance. Bringing that into the story ties it in to real life mystical survival stories. \n\nStone's Earth landing was perfect, and her struggle out of the water reminded me that a real life astronaut had a similar landing. I think it was Gus Grisham.\n\nOf the various incidents that seemed a bit far-fetched in survivability, Stone's making it to the Chinese craft while low on oxygen and managing to successfully figure out how to initiate landing in time was the part that was most over the top, for me. I didn't mind too much though. I'd much rather see her land on Earth in one piece than die in space. I was also surprised by how much damage was done to the International Space Station and the shuttle: both completely destroyed. Wow. Would Russia really do something to cause that level of damage? I'm pretty skeptical, as Russia is active in their space program and use of the ISS. The US even uses Russian launches to bring our astronauts and supplies into space these days, don't we?\n\nSo how do I like it compared to Interstellar and The Martian? I think I liked both of those others a bit better because there were more characters and character interactions, although Bullock and Clooney were fine in this. Although Stone's survival of this disaster seemed a little far-fetched, I don't know that it was less realistic than Watney's survival on The Martian. It was, of course, a lot more realistic than Interstellar, which took some big leaps away from realism for a while.",

We feel every movement the characters make as if they were our own, and when they're frantically reaching for grip while spinning through the abyss, you feel like you could literally reach out and catch them. Unfortunately, for all its striking visuals and moments of genuine tension and fear, it often feels like nothing more than a very expensive and elaborate gimmick. We don't get to know much about the characters, the plot is often kept moving through contrivance or dumb luck and when it finishes it leaves almost no lasting impression.

Clooney was on-screen for much less time than I had thought he would be, but he was also pretty good when he was.\n\nGravity is a solid movie. I wasn't let down, but I had not bought into the expectation that it was the best movie released in 2013. It was nice and short, or else it wold have been almost boring.",

            "content": "\"I'LL SOON MEET HER.\" From October 8, 2013. Gracie and I went to the movies and saw \"Gravity\" tonight. Posthaste, please go and see it. Not only it's a must-see-now, you must see it in IMAX and 3D. I don't know if we got senior citizen's discount, but we paid $14.25 each for the 7:00 p.m. show. Matinee would be cheaper.\n \nGravity is only 1.5 hours long, and it's worth the time to see it on the biggest screen. Not since \"Avatar\" does a film use 3D and the latest cinematic technology as appropriate, not gratuitous. Not since \"Life of Pi\" can a story move the audience both to ask, \"If it happens to me, would I fight hard to survive?\" and to search deeply into oneself and come out believing in having a soul.\n \n\"I'll soon meet her\" may not be an accurate quotation; I plan to see the film again to get it right. It's part of Dr. Ryan Stone's monologue in the face of disaster in space. Dr. Stone is referring to her daughter who died very young. Uneducated in faith, and, thus, an atheist by default, the character of Sandra Bullock articulates the wish, if not belief, she'd see her daughter in death.\n \nThe film director, Alfonso Cuaron, is one of the three amigos of the Mexican cinema (the others are Guillermo del Toro and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu). Cuaron wrote the screenplay with his son, Jonas. While the script could be tighter, the production design has religious references (the St. Christopher icon in the Russian space station, the golden Buddha in the Chinese one). Actually, those references are the reason I'd like to see the film again. Just like \"The Sixth Sense,\" I feel I need a second viewing to see what I'd missed.\n \n\"Gravity\" is ultimately a human drama taking on the meaning of life and soul -- of the meaning of all these -- in the vacuum of space, of nothingness. The Cuarons, father and son, and the whole film production could not have told and shown what's meaningful more beautifully. Please take great care of yourself, and thank you for all you do.

            "content": "Alfonso Cuar√≥n's \"Gravity\" is barely 20 seconds along when an ominous title on the screen reminds us that \"Life in space is impossible.\" With all of the advances in space exploration in the past 60 years, this seems gloomy and unnervingly closed-minded, yet Cuar√≥n backs it up. He then spends the next 90 minutes proving this statement to be correct. Space is a hostile, cold, merciless environment unfit for human habitation. One false move and you'll suffer for it.\n\nOne of the great achievements of \"Gravity\" is that Cuar√≥n portrays space without a single ounce of romanticism. He sees it in terms of cold reality. The story is lean and spare (as well as a running time that it is surprisingly short), presenting a nightmare scenario involving only two people, with a handful of others who exist faintly around the film's edges. One is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) who is on his final mission. The other is Bio-Medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who is on her first trip into space, tagging along to help do some work on The Hubble Telescope. Bobbing and floating around in the blackness of space with the earth looming behind them, they are privy to such breathtaking sights as the polar ice caps, the northern lights and a nasty hurricane pattern somewhere in the vicinity of Florida. Cuar√≥n's great achievement is to put us squarely in the environment itself. We are there with these two travelers, and that makes their dilemma much more palatable. He gets the details right from floating debris - chess pieces, pens and partials - to the stirring scene of floating tears.\n\nAt first, things seem unnervingly calm, yet we know something is coming, and when it does, it happens with scary ferocity. Stone and Kowalski get an urgent message from Mission Control (voiced by old reliable Ed Harris) that a Russian satellite has exploded and has caused a chain reaction, destroying other satellites and causing a massive shower of debris that is headed their way. They have seconds to react. In a moment, the shuttle is gone and they are drifting through the infinity of space. The fate of a third astronaut is a grisly reminder of what they're dealing with.\n\nWhat follows is one damned thing after another as Stone and Kowalski try and figure out how to get to safety in an environment dead set on robbing them of it (Kowalsky clocks how long they have before the debris comes around again). Much of the adventure cannot be revealed without spoilers except to say that while you know the plot, you don't know the specifics. Cuar√≥n creates tension by rooting his plot so organically that it seems to be happening in real time. He keeps the story and the characters very spare, only employing what is necessary to the story. He doesn't gum the movie up with a lot of perfunctory dialogue and needless scenes. Much like \"Apollo 13,\" the dilemma is the story, but unlike that film - where the astronauts had mission control to help - this one cuts the characters loose to fend for themselves. Communication has been lost and they are literally on their own.\n\nThe characters are also very spare. We learn a little about Stone and even less about Kowalski. She's adrift on her mission and in her life. Her space back home is as empty as the blackness she's floating in. Having suffered a tragedy, her life is now meaningless except in her work. Yet, the tragedy in space opens up something in her, a regeneration of will that could only be brought on by crisis.\n\n\"Gravity\" is, for a lot of the time, a one-woman show. Clooney is good, but Bullock gives her best and most stirring performance playing someone who is pushed to the absolute edge of what one human being should have to endure, arriving at the pinnacle of decision of whether to keep going or let herself be consumed. This is a very physical performance, given in long stretches without dialogue. Cuar√≥n circumvents getting to know her through exposition by giving us long, lingering shots of Bullock's lovely, yet wounded, face. Her face becomes the film's most enduring image, peering out through her visor with large eyes that suggest more than she is willing to tell. Inside of her is twisting a weary soul whose body is being subjected to the same measure of extreme physical punishment that she has suffered back in Illinois. Yet, this is a story of how she is forced to finds her way out of the darkness physically, mentally and emotionally. There's a brilliant shot mid-way through the film as Stone floats in a fetal position with an air hose behind her, looking like a baby in the womb. It's a symbol of rebirth that comes as a jolt.\n\nSandra Bullock has always been the most down-to-earth actress of her generation. She's beautiful, but unglamorous and she can reveal more about her emotional state in her silences then most actress' can with gobs of dialogue. Here she creates a character without a lot of exposition and we come to care deeply about her. In a way, this movie, which seems to be about the harshness of exteriors, becomes a moving drama about the wilderness of interiors. The sparseness of Bullock's character allows us to attach our own feelings. She's a person living in limbo both in space and on the ground. \"Gravity\" begins with the information that \"life in space is impossible,\" and as we come to follow Ryan's journey, we discover that this statement is also about her.",

The film's visuals are extravagant and stunning, they consistently left my jaw dropping every second of the picture. The cinematography is equally masterful with long, sweeping takes of gorgeous environments. Usually with CGI I find there is a loss of movie magic considering that you know it is all done with computers, but with this film I was constantly amazed and frequently asked myself \"How did they do that?!?\". The performances are strong and the script is overall good enough. The problem with the picture lies in the character development. While Bullock's character has quite a powerful arch, Clooney's is left out in the open. He has hardly any back story and is in the movie for a disappointing amount of time. The chemistry is there, but there isn't enough depth between the two of them. Overall, Gravity is a film worth the watch for its extraordinary visual effects and cinematography, powerful metaphors and story, but could be a turn off for those who value interesting and unique characters.",

Most people aren't aware that the orbits of the various stations in the movie are hundreds of kilometers apart, so you probably couldn't even see one facility from the other without a telescope.  The \"accident\" could never happen.  Never.  Not according to everything we know about orbital motion, which is pretty much everything.\n\nThe one scene they completely screwed up that was, in my opinion, unforgivable was when Stone and Kowalsky are flying through space attached by a tether, and she gets caught in some rigging, arresting their motion.  She lets go of Kowalsky's hand after they stop, and then he goes flying away - for no apparent reason!  I'm sure they paid an orbital dynamicist for consultation, but maybe they should get their money back if this \"expert\" OK'd the scene and in any way suggested that the \"chain reaction\" of collisions could actually happen.  Anyone with the most basic knowledge of physics would have stopped them from putting that crap in a movie.  That is so wrong, it hurts a little to even think about it.  Most directors worth anything would probably do a bit of research before making their movie, but not Alfonso Cuar√≥n.  Why do your job well when you're going to get paid regardless, right?  I guess he either doesn't care or is banking on the overwhelming ignorance of his audience.\n\nMy biggest problem with this movie is the half-assed story.  They could have just skipped Dr. Stone's background and the ridiculously weak link between gravity and her personal tragedy, but if they were going to do it, they should have gone all the way.  It felt like the personal story in this movie was only half-baked and was never brought full circle.  I felt like I was supposed to care, and I wanted to, but they just didn't make it happen.  Very disappointing...\n\nThe CGI was good, and the acting was pretty great, too.  But the rest?  Meh.\n\nI don't know who got bribed or brainwashed to give this movie so many awards, but they should be given back.  Shame on Hollywood and all the Rotten Tomatoes critics for giving this pile of crap a thumbs up of any kind.

Clooney is typically narcissistic and Bullock is insultingly weak and emotional. It amazes me that this movie is praised for the spectacular effects when it truly shows the audience so little. The essence of writing is to show the audience why we should care about the story through events that build substantial characters. I feel like I'm watching the events of a reality TV show in space. Yeah, the Real Housewives of Space. Or better yet, the constant spray of debris reminds me of NASCAR or the insane car chases we see in World's Wildest Police Videos.\n\nI can't stand the film score. It's like a trailer for a Michael Bay movie. The movie is so much worse than Armageddon with Bruce Willis. At least the mediocre drama was backed up by real human relationships. I understand the director/writer Alfonso Cuaron must've tried to do something \"different\" with this movie and build suspense and create emotion by doing very little in the way of story development in a minimalistic sense, but I have to ask \"why?\" It only adds to the sea of trash movies out there where there is no basis behind the maudlin dialogue and ridiculous scenarios the audience and characters are subjected to.

It's good even great if you've never seen such a thing before. But if you ever seen a murphy's law film then you know where this one is going.

Golly. How much oxygen does the suit have when meter says zero? How many languages & space vehicles of every country they teach them to fly at NASA? If there's an explosion in space causing danger, why does NASA warn the ship 20 seconds before actual impact?

The film made by Alfonso Cuaron, follows the experience of Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) trying to make it out of space when a debris from the Russian missile strike on an exanimate satellite causes a chain reaction, destroying every satellite on it's way.\n\nThe movie starts out as an exciting endeavor when the first chain reaction is caused and the Explorer inhabiting Dr. Stone and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is hit with them being the lone survivors. Gravity is not about its storyline or script but about the experience of being in space and getting out of there. Though George Clooney's character dies within the first hour of the movie, Sandra Bullock does not let his presence escape. The suspense throughout is whether Dr. Ryan Stone makes it out of space.\n\nEmmanuel Lubezki's cinematography was different but at the same time well executed. The cinematography brought the movie to life in a surprising way. The entire concept of this movie was to expose the audience to a situation that is beyond our perceptions of the idealistic conditions in space. Both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney gave noteworthy performances which make this movie credible enough to win the appreciation of critics worldwide. \n\nTo conclude I would say- Don't go for this movie for a concrete story but go for the experience!",

The cinematography consisted of a lot of very long shots, and the constant sweeping motions made by the camera to maintain one shot worked well to compliment the weightless feeling of space. \n\nA lot of effort and care clearly went into making an immersive simulation of being in space with how the characters and everything else moves.The sound design is excellent. It must be difficult to accurately recreate how sound works in the vacuum of space, but this movie did it. This contributed to the tension because it all felt so real.The music is also perfectly atmospheric, being whimsical and entrancing  or harsh and intense when it was appropriate.\n\nI couldn't bring myself to give this a perfect score because of certain story elements.

True the plot is still linear, but to reduce it's score for that reason, I find, ungreatful. For it's not trying to make a story that intrigues you as much it tries to sympathise and relate with you in the struggles that we face as human beings, and how we must learn to adapt to our own circumstances. It's credit is due because I felt truly involved with this movie and the characters struggle, so much is happening at once that at times you feel like she should just give in. But that would bypass the point of this movie, that we are conditioned to survive and move on.\n     Credit is also due for the visuals, as it's quite surprising how realistic this movie looks using today's CGI.

George Clooneys constant story telling. The stories our brain tells us to motivate us.

Sandra Bullock performance is among the greatest performances ive ever seen on screen. \n\nThe writing kept the story tight and focused and i loved that. It had a bump when she explains her backstory, her exposition, of her daughter, giving her charcter the depth that it needs. It felt clunky and unnecessary at the moment, but later on, totally pays on, and is needed. \n\nVisually, just completly stunning. But the visuals are held up and can not exist with out the equally stunning sound scape.

No movie suits this case better than Alfonso Cuar√≥n's \"Gravity,\" which had a strong start with amazing detail and auditory background. If there is one thing great I have to say about Gravity, it is the visuals. The makers of the film knew how to execute the visuals absolutely gorgeously. The same goes with the sound: crisp and perfect. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the story's pace, characters, acting, and overall grabbing of one's attention. The story was unbearably slow paced and lacked coherence. It took the character's almost forever to actually do something. The characters had no back story to defend their developmental attributes. Plus the acting was way too melodramatic especially on Sandra Bullock's part. Half the dialogue was via intercom, which could be perceived as kind of cool, but at the same time in this film it was very repetitive and got very old. The mood was steady the entire movie, which may sound like a good thing, but in reality it provided no sense of excitement to me. If you are interested in seeing Gravity, you may be surprised at despite the visuals and sound, how boring the film really is. Fans of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock will be disappointed if they are expecting a spectacular watch out of Gravity. These actors are capable of carrying through a much more complex, interesting and exciting plot than Gravity has to offer. While the space-like setting was strikingly represented, the main aspect Gravity lacked was depth, with too many missed opportunities here and there. Why not make the movie just a tad more exciting with some type of plot twist? If that had occurred in the film, I could have easily upped the 3 star rating.",

            "content": "Earth to Sandra B\n\nAll the praise for Gravity is pretty much warranted. It's a refreshing and original, almost real-time, almost science-factual, not-too-outer- space thriller. But not enough credit has been given to Sandra Bullock. I've never been a big fan of Ms B. I passed her off as a light-weight Rom-Com ditz with a pretty face. She recently won a Best Actor Oscar for a film I have no intention of ever watching. She's just a tad too airy and fluffy for my taste. But she manages to weigh in with gravitas in Gravity and pull off a harrowing yet seemingly effortless performance. She's in frame for most of the 90 minutes and we never tire of watching her. Above all, and the true mark of a great performance, you can't imagine anyone else playing the role. The part was originally slated for the overrated Angelina Jolie, but i can't imagine Jolie giving it much credibility. Bullock's performance is delicate and well-balanced here, very physical in her desperate attempts for survival, yet intimate and understated, considering the circumstances. I was surprised by the way she carried the movie, alone for the most part (accompanied by Emmanuel Lubezki's glorious weightless and wandering camera floating in and out of close ups and stalking and twirling around her obsessively), talking to herself, trying to hang on to her sanity and maintain her wits to keep alive to return to earth, mind and body intact. She could have pulled it off alone without GQ Clooney altogether. The only other person I can imagine in this role is Jessica Chastain, who has a distinctive edge about her. But Bullock never rubs us the wrong way. She may not convince anyone that she's a brilliant scientist, but she won me over by evoking life's instinctual resolve, and convincing us how precious and precarious life can be. She's nearly 50, a movie actress for more than 2 decades, and still as cute as a button. To her credit, she never attempts to do more than she's capable of. That is, she isn't pretentious or over-reaching. She's sensitive yet comfortable with herself. Assertive yet vulnerable. I'm a Bullock fan now. I look forward to seeing more of her. I trust she will only improve with age. Bravo Sandra!",

Add in a Wall-E fire extinguisher ride in space and a safe landing in the lagoon of Gilligan's Island looking more like Ginger than an Astronaut that lived 9 lives in space.  Just floored how she got nominated for a film where 80% of it was CGI effects with her grunting, whining, screaming, panting, complaining and yes gives up multiple times but Clooney to the rescue even when he is dead one time...so not some strong female movie that I would show my daughter. Sandra is a whining incompetent wimp the entire movie. Clooney the man is calm and smart. Russian space station has vodka. Chinese station has ping pong paddles....it just gets worse and worse the more I think about it.  Go see an IMAX film about space if you need the visual experience but how so many folks have been caught up in the effects and lost sight of the actual film is beyond me.",

This film stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as really the only two characters in this film and yet it really didnt need any more. Both actors were ace, especially Sandra Bullock whos intensity throughout the whole movie kept me on the edge of my seat with her. The graphics are fantastic and this film really couldnt have been made without the CGI we have on offer these days, it really is a showcase of what is possible in cinematography and special effects. Just after one watch I now have to say Gravity is really out of this world. Words can do little to describe the visual astonishment this space opera creates. It is a visual masterpiece and enjoyable thrill ride that deserves everyone watching this film a least once in their lifetime. \nrating: 4/5 \nA great thrill ride space drama.\n\nFor more of me, go check out my official facebook page for all reviews plus more:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MexFilms23?",

It was screened as a opening product at the 70th Venice International Film Festival in August 2013. Considering the quality, it was natural that \"Gravity\" was nominated ten sections and received seven awards at the 86th Academy Awards! Except it, this movie gained a lot of prizes. The reason why it was praised so much is the fidelity. I can't imagine how it was created, but for this film, CG technology and knowledges about the space were used effectively a lot. Thanks of the effort of the production staff, the quality surprised even space professional NASA and real astronauts.\n\n   The stage of this story is a dark, severe and vast place, the universe. The main character is only two persons. One is an astronaut, Lieutenant Matt Kowalski acted by George Timothy Clooney, and the other is a scientist who don't have enough knowledge about there, Dr. Ryan Stone acted by Sandra Annette Bullock. They get involved in some troubles while they are carrying out their missions.\n\n   I watched it in theater, but if you didn't, it is not a big problem. Of course the powerful sound and the dynamic screen of theater make the impact increase more than watch on TV in your house, but it is enough to enjoy it even if on TV. At first, I didn't expect so much about the contents of it before the movie was started. However, the moment it started I was attracted the screen. The sound, picture, and acting drew me into their world. There are no air in space, and it means there are no materials to convey sound. To tell the audience the atmosphere of there, this film uses even such a weak point effectively which a restriction of sound expression. Also the acting of Sandra and the camera work were excellent. They made me think as if the view showed on the screen was real. I was very moved by all of the techniques, acting and story.\n\n   If you have not watched this greatest movie, you should watch it right now!",

            "content": "This is certainly a really good movie, and I'm right on the edge of giving it four stars. When I first saw Gravity, I really enjoyed it, but as I continued to see TONS of praise being heaped upon it, including lots of Oscar hype, I was a little surprised. I liked the movie, especially the visual elements, but is it really Best Picture-worthy? More so than Her, or The Wolf of Wall Street, or The Dallas Buyers Club? Gravity was the main competitor against 12 Years a Slave, and that surprised me, I think making me think of the movie as a little overrated.\n\nUpon rewatching, I've had much the same feelings. I still think it is overrated; though it's extremely effective in some ways, it's ultimately a pretty simple story about a woman trying to survive. As far as I can tell, it doesn't really explore the human condition in a profound new way, aside from the obvious isolating setting. Sandra Bullock's character can occasionally be a little over-the-top, as when she barked maniacally as she lost all hope. And the return of George Clooney's character seems gimmicky, although his character being a hallucination seems a lot more obvious the second time around. Lastly, the movie did that thing I dislike when a character is given a quick burst of 'complexity' by being revealed to have a dead child. Giving a character a dead daughter is kind of a cheap ploy, and it's almost always guaranteed to work, which is maybe what makes it feel so manipulative. So I still didn't like that.\n\nStill, despite all those things, rewatching Gravity reminded me that in a lot of ways, it's a really good movie. The visuals and direction, it needs to be said, are stunning, and all the technical achievements were much deserved. There's a brilliant tension running through the entire movie, and the viewer is compelled to root for Stone even though we don't really know much about her, just because we've seen her go through so much turmoil in trying to escape this suffocating, isolating place. By the time the movie ends and Stone washes up on shore, it's hard not to feel a burst of triumph and happiness that she makes it out alive.",

Veceras sam pogledao Gravitaciju po ne znam koji puta i krenu mi razmisljanja. To je po meni jedan od najboljih filmova koji postavlja hrpu pitanja i nedoumica u ljudskom umu , psihi. Zbog toga jer Gravitacija je film katastrofe , ljudska drama nabijenim iskonskim instinktom za prezivljavanjem, i to prezivljavanje u  prostoru baskonacnosti a to je svemir. Alfonso Cuoran ne koristi tu filozofiju , mistiku , pametovanja , ne pokusava objasniti porijeklo , ne traga za Bogom . Redatelj prikazuje svemir kao cinjenicu, kao beskonacnost i sad sto se dogada u taj svemir u velicanstven , prekrasan , tih ude covjek pocinju nama kao gledatelju prolaziti razno razna pitanja. Prekrasan svemir dozivljen iz sigurnosti je divan , i svemir moze biti okrutan kada vakuumom i radijacijom unistava. \nGravitacija tehnickom izvedbom potpuno uvlaci gledatelja , nudi najmocniji osjecaj direktnog fizickog , dokumentaristickim tehnikama . Sada kada sam vec nekiko puta pogledao film stalno nam postavlja pitanja , sto bih ja ucinio , bi li se zrtvovao, bi li se predao ocaju , oduzeo si zivot , ili bih bio upitan do kraja bez obzira na ishod. Svemir je postao lik . Lik beskonacnosti u kojemu sada covjek ima izbor prepustiti se ili boriti se do kraja za povratak kuci na planetu Zemlju . U ovom slucaju muskarac se zrtvuje zeni za njezino spasenje na putu prema Zemlji dok ona na putu prema Zemlju dozivljava  svoje novo rodenje Tako da je Gravitacija film remek djelo i po meni medu top 5 SF uopce.",

            "content": "Gravity\nJuly 13, 2014 at 2:33pm\nOf which do I speak: Earth's gravity that holds us on the planet, or of something else deeper; perhaps the pull of grasping onto form such as a human body?  I never wanted to see the movie \"Gravity\" because there is no acting, no comedy, no story, nada.. just special effects, another survival movie, and great shots of outer space. I watched it last night and I was astounded by the depth of the film. I contend that this film is non-literal. The film is all metaphor. Every scene is done with purpose and insight into the human spirit. And if I look inside of one scene I can see the entire film. So the film is much like a fractal expansion. Is the movie about outer space or inner space ?\n\nThere are some very clich√© moments such as the lost red shoe that mommy (Stone) found under the bed, reflecting Dorothy's ruby slipper. Meaning of course that we each hold the answer to life within us; nothing external is real (outer verses inner). Or the clich√© words of Kowalski that are present in many films such as \"I still prefer my '67 corvette\" which is then cut off by mission control: \"we heard the corvette story Matt.\" Of course we did. It is clich√©. But then there is a fore shadow when mission control comes back with \"we are going to miss you Matt.\"  That is the exclamation that says Matt Kowalski is going to be dead and is not simply a statement that this is his last mission.  In this way the dialog turns the simplicity of the story from clich√© into something more resembling art. The most clich√© device in the film turns out to be the most powerful, namely the umbilical cord: the tether or connection that is seen throughout the film. When attached the chord symbolizes birth and when detached it symbolizes death. So they die and are reborn from scene to scene. As Stone remarks: \"this is terrifyingly beautiful.\" A fractal that represents endless cycles of being born and dying from moment to moment; tethered and untethered, again and again, forever. The most obvious scene that makes this point is that of Stone floating in the embryonic position with the chord clearly attached: pointedly stated to slam it in our face.\n\nAre they simply in space installing a high tech scanner on Hubble ? Or, are they somewhere else, say somewhere un-Earthly ?  The term for understanding where they are is Bardo: a state of metal activity between realms. Imagine that Stone is in the Bardo of death. That is to say that she is not really in orbit in space fighting to get back to Earth. All of the literalism is gone; erase it. She is at a crossroad where her control over where she goes next is gone. She is dead but her mind is not dead, it never dies. In this strange place karma alone rules the outcome. Just as energy can neither be created or destroyed. Just as for every action there is a reaction. But without a body, or form, the mind becomes subjected to these identical laws of physics. These physical laws dominate the film from scene to scene and dive into the heart of the theme of the entire adventure. But think of them as the laws that also apply to the mind without a body.\n\nThey all die at the beginning of the film when wave of space debris hits them. Stone is never really rescued by Matt. Rather, imagine that Stone's chaotic spinning is now the focus of the point of view of her mind. This is clearly seen from her perspective as she spins. What follows are scenes of the dead. I posit that all are dead. Death is everywhere.  Stone does not realize that she and Matt are dead because she is grasping onto her body and will not give it up. Matt tells her twice that she needs to learn to let go. Once after the parachute entanglement (where Matt untethers). And a second time in Stone's dream sequence. Another clich√© in film (letting go), but a very powerful clich√© here because it means letting go in order not to be reborn. Stone's fate however is to be reborn and she is only able to be reborn, which is very hard for her. She never lets go in the film. Instead she fights to be reborn. Heaven is not available to her. She states that spirituality was never taught to her, and knows nothing about prayer. There are many religious objects in the film that she sees and quickly dismisses. \n\nThe dream sequence is the key scene because it unlocks the deep theme of the film: why is life worth living ? Dying is easy. Living is much harder. We have to fight to live. Why do it ? Why try ? The answer is because life provides the vehicle to liberation, to nirvana, or heaven or whatever you want to want to believe regarding ethics and morality as the laws of mental physics.  The dream is not a dream but rather a literal depiction of pure mental activity in the Bardo of death. This scene explains the preciousness of human life and it is at this point where Stone's mind will grasp onto another form, another realm (also why her name is Stone: she cannot let go of form). There are consequences of thought. Other realms exist besides the human form. The fire scene depicts the hell realm as well as the cold when Stone remarks \"it is colder than hell.\"  The dream scene depicts the ghost realm. The canine chorus of woof woof depicts the howl of the animal realm. Which realm her mind falls into is determined as we hear the sound of a baby on the radio just before Matt enters the capsule in the dream sequence. Stone will be reborn in the human realm. This point is also touched upon when Matt comments that Ryan is a strange name for a girl. To which Stone replies: my parents wanted a boy. The point is that being human is what is important to her, and that gender is governed by karma and not by one's wishes. Ryan Stone symbolizes humanity trapped in the cycle of birth and rebirth.\n\nThe reentry scene metaphor reflects the difficulty of finding a human womb. The landing is birth, getting past the vaginal canal and very obviously birth, crawling, standing, walking. And on top of the obvious is the superset of human evolution from water, to earth; from ape to human. In this way the rebirth cycle is shown as a fractal of all evolution. The same cyclic patterns exist in the microcosm as they do in the macrocosm: the Hermetic principle of correspondence. The laws of the physical world are the same in the mental world. Our quest is greater than just overcoming physical existence. Our quest is to overcome our own mental grasping by embracing spirituality. The only way to achieve purity is by attaining human form: the rarest and most difficult form to attain. Stone achieves rebirth and now has another chance to achieve spiritual liberation from the traps of cyclic existence: truly letting go.\n\nGravity is not a trivial common place survival film with great cinematography unless you see it that way. If you see it as art, then you will find the art in the film because it is there. The film won seven Oscars. Now I know why. \n\n--- It is lonely in outer space",

            "content": "Friday, October 3, 2014\n\n(2013) Gravity\nSCIENCE-FICTION DRAMA/ SUSPENSE\n\n Although, I was exceptionally entertained for the most part, I thought the movie still had consistency problems.   It mainly has to do with the credibility factor as a whole, but from little tidbits.  And yes, I do think it's better seen on 3D visuals than on 2D, except that it sometimes feels that was exactly what it was intended for. It stars Sandra Bullock as Ryan Stone as she's on a routine mission with her fellow astronauts, and seem to be the only female there out of 4 or 5 people.  They then get notified that a Russian missile had hit one of their own satellites, with debris expected to come toward their direction.    As I was watching this, I couldn't figure out whether the information they were receiving was coming from the planet earth, Houston or from the shuttle since Ryan was working outside with Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) aiding her.   Then the satellite remnants are coming straight toward their direction knocking her away from the shuttle and away from the crew, creating havoc and panic.  And as the film had noted right at the opening , because there's no \"gravity\" there's no sound, but as the movie is progressing that was exactly what viewers are subjected to be hearing, such as the use of a fire hydrant up at space, and the hitting of debris while dangling in space, for the only sound we \"should\" be hearing is from whatever is in the space suit the Sandra Bullock character is wearing.   We're then informed later that she was supposed to get to the ISS(International Space Station) since the USS shuttle is pretty much destroyed with zero communication down below, for the only people she can correspond to as well as anyone else who's stranded up in space are the people who're up in space along with her.  At first, I thought it said that it was supposed to be the Russian ISS that she was heading to, but then when I saw the American flag, I then assumed that it must be an American ISS after all.  Then she was supposed to reach the Chinese space station, but by the time she finally got to it, it later looked like it was an American space station too since by the time I saw what kind of flag it was it resembled an American one than a Chinese one.    Also, the fact that theirs almost zero communication from where she was from the people of planet earth is kind of a stretch.  The fact that no one from the planet earth is attempting to reach her is also another stretch, for viewers are oblivious about the time this movie took place on since technology has advanced so much.      And how come the flying debris only comes at it's most crucial time toward the areas she was heading for securement, making it's credibility factor to be too convenient with too many coincidences.  \n\nThe parts that do work is Ryan going on panic mode and attempting to grab anything she can get her hands on, but other than that, it does carry with it some consistency problems.  The overall feel of the movie is reminiscent of me as a young kid and going on one of those carnival rides- a shuttle look-a-like model with a huge theatrical screen inside.  And upon sitting down was a seatbelt customers are supposed to wear, with the shuttle replica rocking back and forth side by side with the huge screen showing things blown up by space ships and so forth with asteroids flying around.  \"Gravity\", the movie reminded me about that kind of experience except that it's intentioned for Imax with 3D visuals with the only thing missing is the rocking back and forth part.    \n\n3 out of 4 stars",

A doctor working on the Hubble? A professional astronaut barreling around like a 10 year old, wasting resources and jeopardizing project safety (he would have been fired SOOOOO fast)? Oh, there in the distance, it's the next place we need to go! Oh, conserve your oxygen but wait, I need to ask you about your dead kid, you have to have a dead kid of course, it's that pathos thing, and later even though you are a rationalist you will speak of her in \"heaven\" and pass along a message....why did he interview her about where she grew up -- they were colleagues, he would have known! And why was he such a yokel, he is an astronaut for crying out loud (or for not). Jeez. Battered and bashed around, still she opens hatches and air locks on damaged craft with ONE heavily-gloved hand (!) and slips off her suit to expose not diapers but a hot tank top and biking shorts? She was over 40, not 20, and even still, she would have broken bones, contusions, sprains, concussion...what did she drink or eat? When did she rest? And that drippy whiny monologue, kill her already! Her precious beautiful daughter, oh how tragic...And if George said \"Sunday drive\" once it was once too many. Why was he portrayed as such a numbskull? \"You have a guy's name\" and of course the default country-western music. Stereotype alert. Didn't the actors say \"This doesn't work\" and \"Wait a minute, that's just stupid\" or \"that couldn't possibly happen.\" -- even the \"special effects\" were lame, they looked like little Lego figures floating around on dental floss. And there is no sound in space? If only that were true so we didn't have to hear Bullock gasping and grunting and saying \"oh, oh oh \" over and over again. And the ending? PUHLEEZE! crawling out of the capsule and swimming? She would have been completely incapacitated, but wait, she has to get to shore so we can hear the hail mary music and see her stand triumphant on the shore, despite the fact that atmospheric adaptation would have rendered her crippled and incoherent (and why did she get out ANYway)...and all the right things remained operational! Many things broke but still she could do what was needed and get \"home\" and then \"rescue is on the way\" -- excuse me? Not soon enough! At 91 minutes it felt as long as \"Gone with the Wind.\" a horrible horrible visitation of crap! Even animated sci-fi from the 1960s was better. Even \"Plan 9 from OuterSpace\" was better!  There was not one, not ONE good ting about this film.  Spoiler Alert: Watching the movie will spoil your night. What is WRONG with these critics? Europa Report was much much better.

Sandra Bullock is also highlighted in her distressing paper. \"Gravity\" opened the Venice Film Festival and received a standing ovation by the audience standing, panting received with applause. Do not expect much from the movie, but when I watched, I felt floating, so that when I left the theater I could not even walk straight. The film is phenomenal. 'Gravity' is a masterpiece of the blackbusters and thrillers. Alfonso Cuar√≥n, for those who do not know is an acclaimed Mexican director and recognized by critics. In 2002, Alfonso conquer the critics with his hit \"Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n\", who gave his first Oscar nomination. In 2004, Alfonso directed \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", and in 2006 returned to the Oscar, received two nominations, for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing for \"Children of Men\" (this human being is... mesmerizing).

With suspension of disbelief and allowing yourself to accept the movie as realistic, it becomes an intense movie, especially in 3D. I especially appreciate the hard work that goes into creating a film with this level of CGI. The film is beautifully crafted with superb acting and life-like visuals. In 3D you get a better feel for the movie and the audience is transported to the empty vacuum of space with the cast. The movie does, however, require the dedicated attention of the audience at all times; Gravity avoids exposition and instead relies on visual imagery, usually in the form of text seen on dials or displays, to explain what is happening, usually these important details are only on screen for one or two seconds and are very easy to miss if the audience doesn't read them fast enough. This is made even harder in 3D as the text will often have some blur or minor distortion.",

The purely computer generated images of the vast abyss of space, a cusp of Earth's surface and a gleaming sun astronomically farther away in the background is spectacularly beautiful. With limited knowledge of space and aeronautics, this is about as real as I can imagine, though I know experts disagree - I'm looking at you Neil deGrasse Tyson. Beyond the aesthetically pleasing set design, I find little else in this picture remarkable.\r\n\r\nWhile beautiful, its artistry in scenery makes the film detached and voyeuristic. Gravity starts almost immediately with the collision and has very minimal character development initially. These factors led me to be unable to suspend disbelief and truly immerse myself in the story nor become invested in the main character's survival. Further, the plot is tired and worn out. Several movies of a similar plot precede Gravity - which is basically a disaster survival story in space (most notably 2001: A Space Odyssey and Apollo 13, among others).\r\n\r\nI can't help but imagine the executives at Warner Bros. and how this film came to be:\r\n\r\nWe need a hit film, a huge money maker, but something new, fresh!\r\n\r\nCGI, its all about that CGI, that's what sells movies...we've just got to take it to the next level!\r\n\r\nYeah, but we've done just about everything on earth...\r\n\r\nThat's the problem! On Earth...space! Brilliant, and we will make it in Imax, get even more money for the tickets.\r\n\r\nYeah, but we have to get actors that get a huge draw in the box office.\r\n\r\nWho is hot right now?\r\n\r\nRobert Downey Jr.? Angelina Jolie?\r\n\r\nNah, Jolie has something scheduled already. Downey probably won't want to do it, he's too improvisational, won't be his style.\r\n\r\nWe could get Clooney? Everybody loves George.\r\n\r\nBut what about the girl? Who won best actress last year? Jennifer Lawrence? Too young. Meryl Streep? Too old. Natalie Portman? Not likeable enough. How 'bout Sandra Bullock? Sandy will probably do it.\r\n\r\nBut who is going to take the risk of making this movie? It could tank. Well, he will have to be a relative unknown, but made a hit before, international, so hungry to break into mainstream Hollywood. Alfonso Cuar√≥n? I think he wanted to be an astronaut when he grew up. Isn't he shopping a script set in space?\r\n\r\nAnd the rest is history...\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, the movie never connected with me, while visually brilliant, it is lacking in all other regards. If you are into special effects and the sheer technical breadth of the undertaking of that crew, whom I commend, then I suggest this movie.",

            "content": "One of the most talked about trailers of the year has been the two-minute trailer for \"Gravity\" that features Sandra Bullock and George Clooney floating in space. In the two-minutes, we see a brief intense and desperate moment in the span of a long movie where Bullock's character, Ryan Stone, tries to grab hold of anything and everything as her situation spins out of control. Many thought, \"Is that it? Is that what the movies about?\" or, \"Two people in space. That movie looks silly.\" Well, \"Gravity\" is far from silly.\n\nOn the other hand, what you see in that trailer is exactly what you will have in store when you sit down to watch it. It is exactly what the movie is about and there are only two people in the entire movie. You will also see an amazingly well crafted, intelligent, exquisite and visceral space journey that possibly puts all other movies of the same vain to shame.\n\nRegardless of what you think of the trailer, you couldn't take your eyes off of it for two-minutes and that is exactly the way the full 90-minute movie is. \"Gravity\" takes you into space and treats you as if you were a tag-along for Ryan Stone's journey. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron is spot on, if not for a few minor moments of over-dramatization.\n\nCuaron may be most well known for his direction of \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", but he also directed \"Children of Men\" and one of my personal favorites, \"A Little Princess\". This is a phenomenal achievement for Cuaron and for the history and future of film-making. If you've ever desired to go to space, this may be as close as you will ever get. \"Gravity\" rings authentic and it is exactly what movies are all about, taking you, the viewer along for a journey that you can't get in your ordinary life.",

If you want the full experience then I think that 3D is needed as when I was watching I could tell that there were specific moments designed to look amazing in 3D. The sound was absolutely astounding it really made you feel like you were there, the sound really building up during the tension packed moment to be instantly replaced with silence, the sound alone makes the movie. I would have scored the film higher but I felt events in the movie were a little cliche with what seemed like everything going wrong along Dr. Stone's (Sandra Bullock) journey. Overall it is a really good film and praise must be given to Alfonso Cuar√≥n for directing this, I think I would enjoyed it more in 3D but still an excellent film.",

It's exciting to watch, and consider that I care about these characters, I really wanted them to survive. To make it realistic, they do use no noise in space and use music, which I'm glad they did use that because it's one of the most beautiful soundtrack I have ever heard in a long time. It's even shot beautifully and it looks like I'm there. There are emotional moments that are rewarding and actually tear me up.

No matter how long it is your jaw will be on the floor wondering how this was pulled off. Everything on the screen must be CG, but it just doesn't look like it at all.  And the length of the take helps sell the illusion.  \nAs the movie opens, a spacewalk is taking place by three astronauts to repair the Hubble telescope.  At the same time Russia decides to destroy one of it's own satellites, starting a chain reaction that sends debris right at our astronauts.  Soon after disaster strikes and the only astronauts left alive are medical engineer Bullock and veteran astronaut George Clooney.  Bullock soon earns her stripes, surviving crisis after crisis trying to find a way to get back to Earth.\nAll of the action scenes are amazing, although credibility is strained with how resilient Bullock's character is; given this is supposed to be her first space mission.  That will only be at the back of your mind because of how engrossing and absolutely gripping all of the action is in this movie.  \nThe suspense and the characters are strong enough in this film without having to add a subtext, but this is what unfortunately happens.  Bullock is given a backstory about how her daughter died in a freak accident and now she needs to be reborn and find herself again, which plays itself out during quiet moments.  It just wasn't necessary to shoehorn this in, I think the film could have been just as strong without it.  We are already connected to the characters through the situations presented. Grade: 9",

I seriously regret not seeing this in 3-D, even if there was the clique I AM REACHING TOWARD THE CAMERA moment in the beginning. You can tell just how much effort was put into making the visual effects look real.\nI also expected a not so interesting story with the visuals, which is also what I got. And I understand that this is difficult to pull off since a) these visuals will outshine almost any story given to it and b) our lead Ryan faces a problem lack of oxygen; therefore she SHOULDN'T be talking in space that much with George Clooney's character about her past. Yet she does so anyways! This would be acceptable had we learned more about Ryan. And what did we learn about her? Her son died...that's about it. \nSo despite these problems Gravity definitely deserves the attention it's been getting.

There is not enough garbage trucks in the world to keep up with how RECYCLED this plot is. \n\nBasically: something bad happens, Sandra stressfully goes to a different space pod or station or whatever and solves the problem before another bad thing happens. Just rinse and repeat for an extremely tedious 1 hour and 31 minute movie that could have easily been a ride at Universal Studios. \n\nSpoiler alert. Clooney's death was emotional, but it had been executed far greater in the vastly underrated Europa Report movie.\n\nBy the way, spoiler alert. Sandra Bullock would not be bloody walking after she crash landed on Earth. You DO know that after spending so much time in zero-G your legs would have adapted to the gravity in the Earth's atmosphere and that adding such a great amount of pressure to your legs after CRASH landing would mean your legs would just collapse? *sigh* \n\nFar too many people subconsciously believe that a simulation in space immediately makes for a perfect movie.

And this is coming from someone who hates her as an actress, but she was good in this movie. I don't care if they got the science wrong with this movie, it is a movie for fuck's sake, not a documentary. There was alot of action and the movie was intense, the truth is they should have renamed the movie, \"Sandra Bullock Should Be Dead\". Mostly I am giving this movie a mediocre review because I felt unsatisfied after watching it. I can't really explain it, but at the end when it was over I nodded my head and said, \"Yup, that was a movie\". I appreciate how well done every part of this movie was, but it felt so pointless.

As a result I just wound up rolling my eyes a lot. \n\nIt's too bad, too. They could have made basically the same movie without turning the sky into a clown car of debris. A single softball sized chunk of metal could have easily caused the same level of destruction as was depicted in the movie, but as usual the need to pander to an audience that wants gasoline explosions and gunfights won out over good storytelling.\n\nLook... if you don't suffer from TMI syndrome this might be a good movie. I can't say because the technical inaccuracies made it impossible for me to suspend my disbelief. I was just not able to get any sense of immersion from it at all. \n\nBut hey... if you like action flicks or have a thing for one of the headliners and you can get past the silliness and just enjoy the spectacle go ahead and give it a watch.

The storyline is a bit far fetched after the accident in space but the photography is amazing.  From a nerds point of view, the International Space Station (ISS Zarya) travels around the earth at approx 17,000 miles per hour.  In order for the Explorer space shuttle to maintain the same distance it too would have to be travelling at 17,000 (and occasionally correct its orbit) yet both appear almost motionless (watch the earth below).  If you want a real-life view of the ISS as it orbits the earth every 93 minutes then visit http://n2yo.com/space-station.  That said, the film has excellent CDG footage and the short accompanying film on the DVD showing the inuit (who talks to Bullock on the radio), his wife, baby and working dogs in Greenland (or is it Alaska?) links to the film well.

            "content": "Gravity is not really a movie, it's more of a cinematic experience . When watching the film, it really makes you feel like you're in space. That experience takes up more than half the movie and really what it give us is enough. I'll jjust say something that might ruffle a few feathers amoung the film community: Gravity is a whole lot better than James Cameron's Avatar. \n\nDr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock)  is on her very first shuttle mission in space with veteran astronaut Matt (George Clooney). Something of course goes horribly wrong. The shuttle is destroyed and the astronauts must find a way to get back to Earth.  Like I said before, Gravity is mostly an experience of what it could be like in Space. Obviously I'm not an astronaut so I have no idea if anything in the film is scientifically inaccurate or whatever. The Visual Effects in this are just astounding. Unlike Avatar, Gravity doesn't look like you're watching a computer. It really feels like you're with these characters in this disaster of a mission. \n\nThe acting here is just fantastic in this film, in particular Sandra Bullock's. For more than half the movie, she has to carry the plot all by herself. And you know what? She Does it very well. It was almost like watching Tom Hanks in Castaway. This movie really shows how great an actress Bullock is and I wish more people in the general movie going public saw that. However, I'll just say it right now: I have no idea what George Clooney is doing in this movie. For most of the time, all he does is chew the scenery as much as possible. George Clooney is one of those actors who whenever I watch him, I don't see a character. All I see is George Clooney act like an astronaut. \n\nBesides George Clooney acting like himself, there is another big problem with this movie. It has a lot of slow moments. I mean yeah there's a lot of action an destruction, but there are times when the film feels like it's in slow motion. I came very close to dosing off once or twice. I think maybe if the film had really great character development not just with Bullock but Clooney too. I mean the characters aren't bad, it's just we don't get much sense of their identities as human beings. Maybe if the film started on Earth and we got to see these people's lives before going to space it wouldn't be an issue. \n\nBesides those problems, Gravity really is a great movie. Is it one of my favorites? No not really. But I would watch it again. It has great atmosphere, great visual effects, great acting from Sandra Bullock and the film is worth watching at least twice. It didn't win 7 Oscars for nothing did it?",

            "content": "http://on-the-couch.com/home/gravity/\n\nThey say, in space, no one can hear you scream.\n\nUnless you're Sandra Bullock.\n\nOld Sandy screamed her way through most of Gravity and I heard every spine-tingling second of it.  In surround sound.  And 3D.  It was epic.\n\nSpace huh.  Geeeeez.  Louise.  Hectic stuff.  I've never been, but those I know who have say it's mental.  Gravity certainly gives that impression and even if I had been contemplating a trip to space, I'd probably reassess it now.  Consider something a bit more low-key.  Micronesia is meant to be nice.\n\nIn Gravity, Bullock plays Dr Ryan Stone, a first time astronaut sent to space to apply her expertise in biomedical engineering.\n\n\"Why do you have a boy's name?\" asks her team leader, veteran spacewalker Matt Kowalski (played by George \"Everything's going to be ok\" Clooney).  Fair question.  \"Because my father only wanted a boy,\" answers Ryan.\n\nOh.\n\nIt's just a glimpse into Ryan's sad life back home but enough to make you realise why she'd agree to leave earth behind and go to space, where she's more out of place than Uranus....\n\nUnfortunately for Ryan, life in space has also got its shit moments.  Before you've finished your choc-top, the shuttle the astronauts are working from is struck by a storm of space junk, sending Ryan and Matt tumbling away into the universe like a couple of tic-tacs.  Space, as it has it, is extremely large.  Ryan and Matt have limited oxygen, pretty clumsy costumes and no map.  Oh, and the meteor shower is on its way back round.  All signs point to giving up on life and spending whatever time is left filming a zero gravity Harlem Shake so at least the world will have something to remember you by.\n\nBut you don't need to have seen Speed to know that Sandra don't just give up.  In fact, the closest she's ever come to it was after Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous.\n\nAnd that, remarkably, is about all you need to know.\n\nOther than this: Gravity was, in my opinion, the best film of 2013.  It is one of those rare movies that can redefine a genre and become the benchmark.  Like The Shining for horror; The Notebook for romance; and Titanic for comedy.\n\nThe visuals are spacetacular.  At times, Gravity feels more like a ride than a movie.  I like 3D in theory but Gravity is one of only three films that I've ever seen that are truly enhanced by that third dimension (Avatar and Life of Pi).\n\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't try to touch things.\n\nSandra and George are well cast and will win awards.  No one has ever said anything about whether or not you can hear George Clooney's voice in space.  You'll be pleased to know that you can.  And it's just as dulcet.\n\nGravity grabs you from the start and holds onto you for a very trim, very compact, very polished, very polite 90 minutes.  There's no fat on this film.  You don't walk away saying \"that was awesome but it could have been half an hour shorter\".  You walk away saying \"that was awesome and hey, shit, it's only 9 and Timezone's still open, let's play air hockey.\"\n\nNow that you've read this review to the end, I want you to do me, and you, one more favour.  Put down your computer, go outside and look up at the sky.  Go on, just do it.  Look at all of it.  Up there.  Look at it and think about how big space is and how small you are.  If it's night where you are, look at the stars, all of them, sparkling and blazing up there as if they were massive, luminous spheres of plasma held together by their own gravity.  If it's daytime, just look at the sun.  Shh, go on, just do it this once, one time won't hurt you.\n\nWe do a lot of things these days, in this crazy modern world.  What we don't do enough is look at space.  So go look at the sky.  What have you got to lose?  At worst, you'll get bat piss in your eye.  At best, you'll see George Clooney.",

            "content": "Rarely do \"space\" movies truly capture the full feel of existing beyond the confines of an atmosphere. Some take liberties with technology not yet available, as in The Fifth Element. More scientifically accurate films such as Apollo 13 place an emphasis on characters and relationships on Earth, distracting the audience from the experience of orbit.\n\nGravity is as close to outer space as many of us may come. Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n paints astronauts on a deep, boundless canvas, enveloping the audience in the vast expanse which lacks air, life, and sound. The camera documents the movements of these space walkers not as we would in a studio, as we sometimes get with zero-gravity flicks, but instead with a lighter touch, allowing the audience to join their astronaut counterparts in their orbit.\n\nThese astronauts have come to the last frontier to fix the Hubble Space Telescope, and Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is an engineer who was rushed onto the mission because of her expertise. This routine mission is led by Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who has a dozen stories for every flight he's ever led (many, we assume). Plans for a quick and clean return to Earth are thrown askew when debris is plunged towards the astronauts and their ride home, as seen in the previews. Gravity, and solutions to their problems, are not easy to come by anymore. And we don't just have a front row seat: we're practically taking the shrapnel with them.\n\nCuar√≥n reaches beyond creating a film, and produces instead an effervescent experience. Point-of-view shots can often be gimmicky, but are executed precisely when necessary inGravity. Honestly, the cinematography is such that the entire ride seems to be in first person, where these POV shots merely accentuate the emotions of Dr. Stone.Another reason the audience is thrust into outer space is thanks to Art Director Andy Nicholson, who creates an Earth so massive, it looms larger than even an IMAX screen can capture.\n\nGravity is unlikely to grab any writing nominations, nor many nods for acting (with the exception of Bullock). However, this film is a visual marvel, on par with 2011's Avatar. The story is simple, real, and tangible, and portrays space in a way that has even impressed Buzz Aldrin (see link below).\n\nGo see this movie, and do it fast. The experience will not be the same at home, no matter how expansive the theater system installed in your basement. In fact, (and I swear I'm not working for a distributor) shell out the extra money to view Gravity in 3D and/or IMAX. While 3D is generally a detriment to good cinema, the setting of this film lends itself to  an elaborate and convincing use of the technology, and is well worth the extra change.\n\nGravity isn't so much just a movie, but a ride that will leave you breathless.\n\nRead more reviews at RJGFilmAnalysis.com",

When Stone is on her first shuttle mission in space with Matt, the whole thing takes a turn for the worst as a shower of broken debri comes flying their way, destroying everything in its path. Stone and Kowalsky are the only ones left alive, tied only to each other, struggling to get to safety in the horrifying blackness of space.

The scene were Sandra Bullock first takes off her space suit is a beautiful update of Sigourney Weaver's classic Alien scene.\nI was told there wasn't much dialogue but I thought it had a substantial amount and most of it throwaway.

I'm in the minority, clearly, but I'm not alone, so here's why I hated Gravity.\n\nSandra Bullock's character should never have been an astronaut. At best, she is a panicky dipstick in distress who either yammers or stutters her way through much of this film and seems to have no idea how things work or what to do when things break down. It seemed like she had no training at all.\n\nThe silence is not terrifying. I don't care how many reviewers just couldn't wait to use the phrase \"deafening silence\", the silence is NOT terrifying. The silence COULD have been terrifying if there was any real threat or I cared about the character at all, but unlike Aliens there were no monsters lurking in the hallways. It was just Bullock vs. her own jittery dumbness. I didn't care if she made it back alive or not. Clooney's character didn't last long enough to be developed, so I didn't care about him (honestly, Clooney's character was just George Clooney playing George Clooney in an astronaut suit) and the only other character, who we only see in a couple shots, died even sooner than that. We're not given any real background on anyone, there is no real story and honestly some of the physics were just embarrassingly wrong. \n\nIf you haven't watched this film yet, but you're curious, just do this instead: \ngo to Google, find some amazing looking images of space. Now imagine Sandra Bullock, in a spacesuit, floating around in those images and saying \"no no no okay okay\" over and over, flailing her arms and breaking things (and barking like a dog in one scene. Yes, I'm serious.) You just watched Gravity.\n\n It seems like they were trying to make Castaway in space and it did not work. This is a better screensaver than a film.",

I can't claim to know anything about physics but it just seemed far-fetched so that basically you've got a disaster movie that without all the amazing visuals its just okay. Gravity reminded me of Apollo 13, in that everything that could go wrong does, for astronaut Sandra Bullock -who is having the worst day ever. George Clooney is just being George Clooney (he's barely in the movie), a space cowboy playing the same character he is in all his other movies. Charming, flirty, heroic in a humble way. He was this guy on ER like a hundred years ago. Anyways I'm sure if I'd seen it in the theatre I would have given it a higher rating as that's how its meant to be seen but that would still be based on the special effects not the story or the acting or the gratuitous floating underwear scene. Still I don't regret watching it, the effects are game changing and it must have been grueling for the actors to film. Ending left things a little vague.  5/10/14",

            "content": "While watching Gravity, you'll probably feel that you're watching something new.\n\nClearly there are familiar elements in the movie. Disasters, like space are well-trodden themes in film. But they've never been approached in the same way that Gravity does. It's a perfect storm of innovative camera animation, lighting, acting, visual effects and audio design that all come together to compliment an interesting script and developed characters.\nThe result is one of the most compelling science fiction movies ever made, which is helped extraordinarily by the focus of the film. Sandra Bullock plays Dr. Ryan Stone, a new astronaut who is paired up with the veteran Matt Kowalski after their mission inevitably goes bad. It's an interesting dynamic to watch unfold and both actors impress despite the limitations that the movie placed on them. Clooney especially left me desperately wanting more of his character, and I can't help but feel that was intentional given the development of Bullocks character later on in the movie. Cuar√≥n also gives Bullock a lot of alone time on screen and she delivers what can only be described as a master class in using body language to convey emotions.\n\nConsidering how action heavy the film is, I was surprised by just how much I learnt about, and came to care about both characters. That's an impressive feat given that by modern standards the film is fairly short with a 90 minute run-time.\n\nSpeaking of action, I do not feel that I am exaggerating when I say that the high-octane scenes in Gravity are among the most tense sequences I have ever seen. This is where Cuar√≥ns now infamous use of long shots has been put to good use, and he takes every chance he gets to move and contort the camera in every way he can imagine. The fact that many of these scenes involve no cuts whatsoever drew me into the action without even realizing the presence of such a device, and everything is expertly mixed to Steven Prices heart-pumping score.\n\nHowever these long takes are also used in a lot of the quieter moments in the film. Here too the continuous shots are used with surprising maturity, even considering who's creating them. Some of the best symbolism in the film comes as a direct result of how natural the movement is, and although some of it admittedly feels forced it's always integrated into the story well and when done right gives a whole new meaning to some of the shots.Quite frankly, you could (and I will) discuss Gravity for hours, but when the credits rolled and the lights came up I was simply in shock. It's a genuinely jaw-dropping experience which showcases everything that makes film great, and I really can't offer any better praise.\n\n- expandac.com",

            "content": "Nothing can defeat a space adventure that Gravity is. Gravity is visually-stunning. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney are spectacle in this cinematic experience where viewers feel they are part of the suspense. Especially in IMAX 3D. There have been several space movies that have captivated me, and at first with Gravity I was worried about it at first with the fact it is only ninety-two minutes. Where as most space movies go like two hours flat. However, it was a ninety-two minute thrill ride that I will have to experience again once it re-releases in IMAX January 31st. It is so worth it even for a second experience if it has already been seen once.\n\nThe story follows a space mission involving two astronauts in space Ryan Stone (Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (Clooney). Both are traveling space together and working on space mechanics in space. However within minutes of their procedures, things start falling apart. Satellites crashing, metal objects flying everywhere, and the home base getting destroyed. This leaves only Stone and Kowalski to find a way to survive so many stories high into space with probably very little or maybe even know help. In IMAX the suspense feels real, and you feel like literally you are joining them in the process of trying to survive.\n\nI was blown away by this movie. I am a fan of many space movies like Apollo 13, ET, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and many more. It makes you look back at these space films wondering how space can be. It especially makes you think about what would actually happen if you could go to space in your life. How would you prepare? What can possibly go wrong? Gravity leaves you asking yourself all of these questions and actually makes the film become a more inviting experience when it gets even more suspenseful.\n\nThis is  Alfonso Cuaron's tenth installment. I remember the most previous sci-fi movie he directed was back in the year 2006 and the film was Children of Men. For the editing he had his editor who edited his film Children of Men to edit Gravity. That editor is Emmanuel Lubezki. I will say honestly the editor deserves credit for editing this roller coaster ride of a movie. He made the space scenes so visual and was able to capture a variety of facial expressions of Sandra Bullock. Those facial expressions make audience feel that we can feel the emotions of the danger that Bullock's character is experiencing.\n\nDo they make it out of space alive? If you have not seen it Find out and see it for yourself. Three and a half stars. It is now playing in 3D for a limited time but if you really want the experience it returns to IMAX January 31. Do not miss it.",

Sandra Bullock is also highlighted in her distressing paper. \"Gravity\" opened the Venice Film Festival and received a standing ovation by the audience standing, panting received with applause. Do not expect much from the movie, but when I watched, I felt floating, so that when I left the theater I could not even walk straight. The film is phenomenal. 'Gravity' is a masterpiece of the blackbusters and thrillers. Alfonso Cuar√≥n, for those who do not know is an acclaimed Mexican director and recognized by critics. In 2002, Alfonso conquer the critics with his hit \"Y Tu Mam√° Tambi√©n\", who gave his first Oscar nomination. In 2004, Alfonso directed \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", and in 2006 returned to the Oscar, received two nominations, for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing for \"Children of Men\" (this human being is... mesmerizing).

It took a lot of time and effort to get this film made, as well as some groundbreaking special effects, and it's a very eerie and atmospheric thriller set in space. Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is on her first mission into space on the Space Shuttle Explorer, with veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who is on his final mission. While on a routine mission doing repairs to the Hubble Telescope, they're hit by fast moving debris which destroys the rig they're working on, and Stone ends up flying into space with little oxygen, about to come to terms with her death, she's saved by Kowalski, who has a jet pack. They make their way to the International Space Station, so they can get an escape capsule back to Earth, but they don't have a lot of time to do it before the debris orbits Earth. It's a different kind of space film, it's not science fiction, it's science fact, as Cuar√≥n did his science homework before filming started. It requires patience and the open vistas of space with the majesty of Earth behind them is beautiful to look at. How they did the weightless scenes is worth wondering",

I think it got everything of what it's like to be in outer space. While the idea of trying to survive in outer space, the situation that Ryan was in seemed to be out of touch, for the lack of better explanation. I really thought there was going to have a real tragic ending but I guess showing someone who has the mentality to be strong no matter what, is a good thing too. The fates of the other two didn't go so well and it's a better example of how it goes when there are flying debris coming at you every 90 seconds. Those things are literally dangerous in outer space.

It was released in October 23, 2013. \n\nThe main topic of the story is two astronauts who go to mission and lose all connection with the Earth and so all chance of rescue. The main characters are Dr. Ryan Stone, who is played by Sandra Bullock and veteran Matt Kowalsky who is played by George Clooney. \nEntire story takes place in the infinite and unforgiving realm of deep space. \n\nThe summary is: \nit is the first expedition aboard a space shuttle for dr Ryan stone . She accompanies Matt Kowalsky . During a flight disaster , the two astronauts lose the control of the shuttle. They find themselves alone, without contact with the ground , left to themselves. At the end of the film we learn that only Dr. Ryan Stone Is back to earth.\n\nThe good point is that throughout the movie the viewer believe the two astronauts return live from this adventure. However, for some it may seem a bit long and ennyant as the the movie is essentially based on plans with the two astronauts trying to survive. \n\nI found this movie very exciting, which is why I recommend it to all people who love suspense and emotions.",

This movie may be the closest thing to a perfect movie I have ever seen. With one hell of a great score from Steven Price, and Gorgeous visual effects, Gravity may be the most stunning space movie we have had ever.

            "content": "Gone to see this movie eight times in the theaters before it came out! Such a well done movie! through out the movie you will be on the edge of your seat. Gravity is thrilling, horrifying, and I think one of the best science fiction movies in years.\n\n1. Script: The script of this movie is rather touchy since they are acting as professional astronauts and scientists. Not all of this movies viewers know science and space lingo, so that is a problem. But I think the director and script editors did a very good job at watering down the technical language to something we all as the viewers could understand. \n\n2. Visual Effects: There are many graphically challenging hurdles of \"filming\" in space.  With the visual effects most of the acting took place in anti-gravity chambers coated in a green screen effect. In order to make this movie appeasing to all these space nerds the landscape of outer space had to be NASA good. I feel like the visual effects were outstanding and exceeded my expectations!\n\n3. Actors/Actresses: The leading actors were the amazing Sandra Bullock and the classic George Cloony. I think the director Alfonso Cuar√≥n did a great job with choosing the main roles. Sandra Bullock did a rather amazing job acting in this movie, she fit the role rather well. George Cloony only had a short role but an important one, but he pulled it off well. \n\n4. The Story Line: The film is set during fictitious space shuttle mission STS-157. A medical engineer (Sandra Bullock) is put on a space shuttle mission. When tragedy strikes quick, she is the lone survivor. I think this is a timeless plot, put into a modern day type of setting. The only  thing I would fix is the short period of the time before the accident, but other than that it was awesome to watch.\n\n\n5. Sound Effects: Most of the audience hasn't heard the loud crash of a shuttle taking off, nor have we had the chance to hear the silence of space. The sound editors wanted the sound to be heard as authentic as possible. I feel like they did, they made the effects sound clear and correct. Job well done.\n\nYou will not regret redbox'ing this movie, If your into Sci-fi, Thrillers, or even eye opening movies this is the film for your liking.",

            "content": "Grade:High 7/10\n\nGravity is a film that although I feel was and is overrated, still\nmanages to put together a good drama and with some breathtaking\neffects, I would still recommend this to everyone. From a fine director\nwho has only really come from the shadows with this film to a duo that\nshare this film and well Ii must also mention they are two of the\nbiggest stars in Hollywood. With it's massive effects come massive\naffects to the characters and with some speedy space junk to and escape\npods everywhere this film guarantees thrilling stuff. I felt this film\nwas strongly good, and here is why.\n\nThe story is a good one, not the finest I could think of but with some\ngreat thrills and also spills, you are never not gripped to it. I felt\nthat the story at times did rely on it's effects and soppy stories of\nhome to fill in the gaps but nevertheless it is a solid story and even\nif it is kind of simple still makes for pleasant viewing. The pace is\nfast and big and you really don't know what will happen next, this one\nreason rated this slightly higher as predicting what happens around her\nis near impossible and all down to writing of a great writer and\ndirector.\n\nSandra Bullock in the main role does a good job if not slightly over\ndramatic one at times but manages to be great by the end. George\nClooney as back up seemed nearly too chilled to execute his role well\nenough and just seemed to float around the entire film without trying\nto do anything. With this there are only ever the two in it which makes\nfor cool viewing as you do in the end get to know quite a bit about\nthem even if the movie is only 91 minutes long, good stuff yet again\nfrom Cuaron.\n\nAlfonso Cuaron has to be one of the most underrate directors of our\ntime and I swear he can make any film better than it seems or just\ngenerally better. His skill with the word is good too and some\ndialogues I this although not always executed perfectly by the cast, is\ngreat stuff and his choice of dialogue is intriguing at best. I can't\nnot mention the effects which are just massively and crazily big with\nsome sublime work done by the studio behind this, the entire thing\nlooks real and on such a scale too just wow, one of the best film for\neffects I have ever seen seriously.\n\nI do feel this film is overrated like I said, although Cuaron is\nperfect and did deserve his Oscar for his work, I got annoyed with\nBullocks character and wasn't sure if that was just how Cuaron wanted\nher to be or Bullock wasn't playing her right. I also will add that\nalthough the drama is good and thrilling, this film offers very little\nmore in terms of anything and I cannot see why it is so highly reviewed\nas it seriously is nothing special(well maybe the effects are but\neffects don't make an entire movie flawless).\n\nThose who enjoy space adventures will like it as Gravity is basically\nwhat it says on the tin, she spins around in the earth's gravity a lot,\nbut it makes for good viewing though. I think Clooney fans may be\ndisappointed as we don't see loads of him and his screen time is just\nnot enough for him to save himself from his stale performance. I know I\nsound like I hate it but it is actually worth a watch from anyone, no\nmatter what type of film you think you like, this can be enjoyed.\n\nOverall I give this a high 7/10 meaning it is Strongly a Good film, it is very\nnear to being very good but certain factors don't allow it to move\nupwards to there. Don't watch this and say you like it because all\ncritics say they do and because it won Oscars, see for yourself, I\ndidn't find it great but it was good and personal opinion is everything\nhere. One more thing is the score by Steven Price which I am not\nkidding can make you heart beat faster in the more thrilling parts, and\nalso go see this in 3D if you want even more thrills than it already\ngives.",

            "content": "Watching Gravity for the first time was amazing. And it always will be. This is one of those movies, for me, where the first time you watch it is the best time because you get all the excitement and emotions that you had with the most effect because you don't know what bone-chilling moment would come next (I honestly had no idea where I was going with that sentence). Some might say that all movies are like that but they aren't because they don't have those tense moments that really make you sit on the edge of your seat biting your nails, with the exception of a few. Anyway, I recommend you see Gravity in 3D. I know it not in theaters anymore for some people but there are such things as 3D TVs (not trying to make you spend money, I'm just saying). I urge you to watch it in 3D because it will be more realistic and actually make you feel like you're in space. This movie was the only one that I have ever seen that actually made me blink awkwardly and flinch when a piece of debris supposedly \"hit the screen\". Next I'd like to talk about the story. The story is pretty bland with not much to keep it going other than the characters and their goal to get home. But that doesn't really bother me mostly because it's not the story that actually keeps you invested in what's going on. It's the visual effects and acting. Without those, this movie would be about a 0.5/5 for being plain boring. But it's not like that, so that's what I want to talk about next: acting. We pretty much have two people acting for an entire movie with the exception of the voice on the radios and stuff. The main characters are Ryan Stone and Matt Kowalski played wonderfully by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. They practically are the movie which is good because they are great actors. You really feel for them and want them to make it even though in the back of your head you know they might not. It's great and I love it.\n\nSo all in all, Gravity is a movie with great visual effects and superb acting, but the story is somewhat plain, even though that doesn't get in they way much. 4.5/5.",

The fact that it had a good backstory just put it up even higher in my book. No it is not just someone floating in space for 2 hrs despite what ppl tell u. It makes me appreciate astronauts more and wonder more about there job and space in general. I forgot clooney was in this, but he was well cast. I also really liked how it made u think outside ur space on earth. Beautiful and terrifying like u r in space urself. Movie seems to be pretty dividing for reviews but I'm on the loved it camp.

George Clooney plays Astronaut Clooney-Ocean while Bullock flounders around space complaining the entire way. Everything seemingly won't go right for Bullock as space counters her every move. This film has some of the worst lines I have heard in recent memory. Bullock's spiritual awakening and the failure of science in space seems to give this film some ulterior motives.

Sandra's character was completely inept, had no business being up there, and George's character *SPOILER* let himself die to save her after she did everything in her power to kill everyone. ARGH! I did enjoy Clooney's performance. He made The Fonz look warm. On top of everything else, it's way too friggin' short at under 90 minutes before the credits. Ridiculous for a film like this. It's not all bad though, as I did enjoy much of it, just not the worthless, poorly trained space chick. Best Picture nomination though? No way.",

            "content": "Well here we are, the big Oscar winner, the talk of the town, so it seems. My brother stuck this on the Bluray the other night when I was at my folks, so without any warning I was thrown into orbit alongside the ever annoying Bullock and Hollywood lapdog Clooney. One thing was for sure, it was gonna be pretty.\n\nThe lowdown, a small team of astronauts are fixing the Hubble telescope when a field of lethal debris from a recent Russian missile strike on a satellite, hits them head on. The debris causes massive damage and strands our plucky heroes in orbit with virtually nowhere to go. From here on they must fight to survive by spacewalking to other nearby space stations to try and reach any remaining capsules so they can get back down to Earth.\n\nOK so the first thing anyone with a brain will notice is the special effects, the visuals in general. Without trying to sound too deflating I have come to expect flashy super-duper effects from most modern films these days, its a given really isn't it, if the film doesn't look ultra amazing you'd be shocked. So while this film does have the perfect realistic look of a real NASA film from a real space mission...it somehow isn't overly mind blowing truth be told. It sure does look spot on for total scientific accuracy in every aspect from the space suits, the spacecraft, the space stations, cockpit controls, weightlessness, every little nut bolt and screw, and space physics in general.\n\nSo I can understand why this film won visual effects, kudos. But then we have the plot issues and accuracy issues, yeah yeah I know but come on, a big realistic film like this had better get its facts right...yes?, no. First off this Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite?? what the splodge was that about?!. Why would a country fire a missile at a defunct satellite firstly, surely this is bound to cause a chain reaction of problems. Secondly why blow up a satellite that no longer works? seems a bit over the top to me, surely you'd bring on international outrage doing this? causing a massive disaster in space, it just seems a really dumb decision. Then you have the fact that the astronauts lose contact with control completely, really? out of all the kit they have up there on various international platforms they still can't contact control! that's scary right there.\n\nI won't go on about the technical issues as its nitpicking really...oh just one more. The astronauts travel between the Hubble, the ISS and the Chinese space station as if they are all in the same orbit!!. I'm afraid these objects are not in the same orbit and travelling between them would take some planning and a heck of a lot of fuel and oxygen, but hey kudos for trying anyway.\n\nWhilst watching this visual extravaganza I realised something midway through, this film is nothing more than a pumped up Universal Studios or Disney's Hollywood Studios ride (formally MGM). Its all about the visuals and the ride, the plot is minimal and the acting was pretty standard in my opinion. Of course this being shown mainly in 3D only emphasises this notion, this whole experience is merely a theme park ride, hell I'm damn sure this film will be made into a theme park ride seeing as its pretty much there anyway, I can see it now, rumbling seats and smoke. There's nothing wrong with this essentially as it does what its suppose to do and thrill you with flashy CGI, but overall I kinda felt a bit tricked or cheated as it in no way feels like an actual movie.\n\nAs I already said the acting didn't inspire me much frankly. I dislike Bullock and have never rated her as an actress in any of her films mainly because she's the same in everything with that annoying squeaky clean voice and image. The same can be said for Clooney who simply plays Clooney in EVERYTHING!!, this guy cannot act one iota, he just does his smooth smug ladies man act because that's all he can do. He acts no better in this film than he does in a recent British coffee advert, its the same performance people!!! only difference here is he has an astronauts suit on sheesh!!. \n\nI won't deny I didn't enjoy the film to a degree, it was nail biting at times which was all made possible down to the stupendous effects. But was it really that exciting? really? I mean the whole thing was so predictable, you know from the start the female will survive because in every film women are now the heroes (see what you have started Mr Cameron, with your 'Ripley' character). There was never a point where I didn't think she wouldn't survive otherwise there would be no film, there was only one slight surprise character wise, and I highlight *slight*.\n\nI can see why this film made a splash and I fully backup the effects award even though in this day and age its not exactly a game changer, I think. The way they went about creating a fully realistic thriller in space that looks no different to something you'd expect to see from real footage is admirable, but that's all it is. Where as 'Apollo 13' was a nail biting epic drama, this really does feel like a short bombastic theme park ride with a wafer thin plot that's no better than a videogame. There's been a lot of fuss over this film and apart from the visuals I really don't get why. I feel like I'm repeating myself (I am) but bottom line its a big thumbs up for the effects and realism, but that's as far as it goes for me, my score reflects those two elements only.",

This is way over-hyped, the dialogue is just crazy awful, and do we seriously have to go the entire movie listening to Bullock breathing heavy into a mic or George Clooney there solely for the fact that he's a \"heart throb\". I rarely ever write reviews on bad movies, but this one deserves to be knocked down a bit.\n[Spoilers]\nOh yeah, also forget some of the huge plot holes in this movie such as: Bullock's oxygen tank dropped from about (I don't know the EXACT numbers, but these are pretty darn close) 20% to 8-10% in 5 minutes when the debris first hit the astronauts and sent her flying. Then, an hour trip with George tugging her with a jet pack and she still manages to have enough left to spend an additional 5-10 minutes struggling with George to grab onto the space station and manage her way to the entryway (oh yeah, let's have her narrowly make it as she's breathing CO2 in only the last minute or two).\nOr, an additional plot hole being that she fumbles her way from space station to space station and narrowly fumbles her way back to earth. She's an astronaut who should have had a ton of training, instead she's portrayed as though she was taken straight out of highschool, given a 30 minute introduction on being in space and then sent into space for a repair mission. Oh yeah, and Clooney was acting like a kid at recess in the very beginning as he wastes his jet pack to fly around goofing off and only doing some slight work on the satellite. He gets a jet pack, but the other two don't...and he's playing with it like a kid. Then, he comes back as a vision and gives Bullock crucial information...information she should have already known as an astronaut, but let's take away all of her training and have her do \"eeny-meeny-miney-mo\" on a control panel.",

She gets into a doomed vehicle and then survives one unlikely catastrophe after another.  Since she is the only living person in most of this version, tricky things like witty dialogue don't need to be encountered.  No need for character development.\n\nCharacter development--limited to a non sequitur (about 2 paragraphs long) where she suddenly divulges that she had a daughter who died,  Losing the girl evidently meant something to her but the fact that having the girl must have meant there was another human being who got close to her seems not to register.  More character background would take acting.\n\nActing--The best thing about this movie is that Sandra Bullock doesn't have to act.  All she has to do is climb the exterior of disabled space stations and get tossed around by space debris.\n\nSpace debris--Webster's defines it as a movie called Gravity.",

As good as the best pure entertainment in cinema nowadays, it's a simple movie easily enjoyable for the sheer sensorial experience, but with good conceptual nuance and wittiness. An engaging, frenetic and thrilling dance in the tremendous abyss of space filled with metaphors and symbolisms for Life (which anyone takes seriously/interprets as judged). Very good acting from Sandra Bullock, I enjoyed the character development of Ryan, some melodramatic moments seemed superfluous to me and distracted. I watched in 2D and still felt immersed in the adventure and assimilated the premisses. I have some doubts about the replay value, after the first view I didn't feel the impetus to re-watch, \"Gravity\" entertains while it lasts and it's very clear... maybe too clear, it lacks the mysterious or transcendental factor to addict me, probably it's markedly popular and accessible nature limits it in my eyes... In any case, I think \"Gravity\" will become a classic of contemporary cinema because it's a hallmark of technical mastery and it's \"... one hell of a ride\" like nothing else.",

Mentioning Cuaron in the same sentence as del Toro and Inarritu as 'three amigos of Mexican directors' seems ridiculous, though, because del Toro at least, and I'm assuming Inarritu, too, does not come even close in his films. Alfonso's in a whole 'nother league. Blah blah blah, it's an amazing movie, basically. Best picture of 2013, more than likely, and that's not just hype speaking.

I felt that the director could have changed the stylistic approach at times (some scene's would have worked better without music) and the script felt dry and at times a little too cheesy and preachy for it's own good. Even the visuals which I thought were incredible were not always consistent ; The CGI when Bullock's character was inside of the Space Station ended up looking really fake and distracting when merged with live action footage. Along with that I just felt that besides the visuals, nothing else in the film really stood by it's own merits. The thrills weren't as thrilling and they could have been, the drama wasn't as affecting, the moments that try to be profound come across and cheesy and/or overdone, and I felt like the good moments were too quickly rushed to leave a lasting impression. Overall, it wasn't as good  2013's other survival film, \"All is Lost\" or  director Alfonso Cuaron's earlier film, Children of Men\".",

Oh and look! She's grown as a character, even more reason for you to like her!\"\n\nThe incredibly blatant way that it was shoving this down my throat was way too obvious and kind of annoying for me; honestly, it probably did more to detach me from my movie-watching experience than anything. If I'm conscious of the fact that I'm watching a movie, and one that is desperately trying to make me like its main character at that, it's going to be very hard for me to get into the experience.\n\nIf you find space and space travel at all interesting, watch this. It's pretty cool to see how they simulated weightlessness (and incredibly well, at that) and watching the ISS get torn apart in silence was terrifying and awe-inspiring at the same time.

Sandra Bullock hops between different space stations talking to NASA (the audience) about how scared she is. She crashes down to earth and walks off into the sunset. The End.

No, el cine de Cuar√≥n re-define, como lo dijo una vez Cameron al ver esta cinta, c√≥mo se debe ver el cine 3D. Lo cual en parte le amerit√≥ su premio en la academia.\nLas vistas en primera persona vistas con el efecto 3D, mejor llamado estereoscop√≠a (su nombre real y no comercial), logran un deleite a la pupila de quien admira este efecto en las vistas en primera persona. Nos dice que no es un videojuego, es una nueva forma de ver pel√≠culas. Los efectos, no se diga, son sorprendentes, tambi√©n se llev√≥ ese premio en la noche de los Oscares. Y si bien la banda sonora no es tan apreciable en el mero inicio, en el resto es una de las m√°s gustadas popularmente. El gran personaje es todo el ambiente extra pues solo cuenta con 3 actores de reparto, uno de ellos hace una voz (Ed Harris) el otro es George Clooney, quien realmente hace su parte y por supuesto la principal Sandra Bullock quien interpreta a una doctora que est√° instalando un sistema de salud en el espacio.

It follows Ryan Stone, played by Sandra Bullock, and Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney. Ryan is an engineer who is repairing this satellite in space, Kowalski is an Astronaut who is on his last mission to take Ryan to space. And from that point everything goes wrong. I'm not going to spoil too much, but stuff happens that gets the two main characters into a bit of a pickle. The movie is one of the most visually stunning movies I have seen since Avatar. It took four years to make, and they have succeeded in making one of the most gorgeous movies I have ever seen. Best use of 3D that has been put on screen. The acting in the movie is great. I really cared for the two main characters. I wanted them to get back to earth. A lot of people have a problem with the movie that it's just like a Universal Studios ride, maybe it is, I agree with them that it's like a Universal Studios ride but that's part of the reason that makes Gravity do great. Another complaint is that there isn't enough story in Gravity, that there is no back story. Who cares? Is being stuck in space not intriguing enough?   I had no real complains to the movie. I was engaged throughout the movie. It was intense; it was pumped with adrenaline for the full 90 minutes. A couple of problems are that the dialogue isn't so great, but that's how I would talk in real life. Another thing is that there is this scene that is like a dream sequence that tells the main character what to do, which kind of bothered me, it seems like an easy fix to the situation. But other than that I have no big complains to this masterpiece.",

Winning eight Academy Awards, due to the perfect amount of visual effects and cinematography. The movie was shown in 3D, to give it that extra dimensional twist. I must confess I really sat on the edge of my seat. With the voice of Ed Harris (The Abyss, Enemy at the Gates) as Mission Control. 'Gravity' hits the spot and is definitely a film I would recommend on seeing. Hold on tight, you're in for one hell of a ride... \n\nDoing some service on the Hubble Space Telescope on Explorer, medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) is accompanied by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney), as Mission Control in Houston (Harris) warns them a cloud of debris caused by a explosion on a Russian Satellite. The debris' impact catapults Stone into space, where she loses all contact with Mission Control. Luckily she is found by Kowalski, who is wearing a thruster pack. Together they make their way back to a destroyed Explorer. All the other astronauts are dead. All contact with Earth has been broken. While Stone's oxygen is running low, the two survivors try to reach the International Space Station. Can they make their way back to Earth or will they drift into the endless universe?",

It might seem a little hokey to some, but I appreciated the message of the movie. Also, if you haven't seen the special features, do so. This movie has definitely expanded the movie making process from a technical stand-point. A bunch of smart people, figuring out new solutions to problems that take visual effects to the next level.

            "content": "Space - endless void with undiscovered mystery things that we probably would never know. There is nothing to carry sound. No air pressure. No oxygen. Weightlessness, dead silence, extreme temperature fluctuations, loneliness, emptiness and darkness... Now, imagine you there, your body is levitating. Peace and quiet, you close your eyes, think about your life... and BOOM, know you are rotating  and quickly  going to outer space. And you released that there is no help for you and you are simply waiting for the end of your Life Journey.\n\nThat nightmare happened to Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), medical engineer who has never been in space before. She was accompanied by Matt Kowalski(George Clooney), veteran astronaut making his final mission. It was supposed to be casual repair of space ship. Unfortunately they flew in meteor shower and smash their ship to small pieces and both Dr. Ryan and Matt gone in space void. Special effects and music ware really great and perfectly selected to this part. They highlighted the drama of the scene and showed powerless in their eyes. It was very touching.\n\nWhole story has been told in a very good way. They give as a chance to meet the characters, to feel the connection, to personify with them. If we care about someone, it is hard to lose him. It very hard to achieve when viewer sits in front of the screen with big eyes and can wait what happen next - and  they did it.\n\nSo, if you would like to see dramatic movie with great special effects then your time in the cinema won't be wasted. If you also like little funny accents in this kind of films this film has been made for you.",

Hell, Clooney and Bullock gives one of their best so far.\n\n2)It has character development\n\nDear Tut, unless you were not watching the film who will see there IS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! Bullock's character likes to be alone and Clooney's character is well.... George Clooney type person. \n\n3)It is exciting\n\nOk, tell me this film is not exciting.

            "content": "\"Either way, it'll be one hell of a ride,\" Sandra Bullock shudders before taking a deep breath, one she knows could be her last, as she braces herself for one of the most intense and iconic scenes in Gravity. Indeed, Gravity is one hell of a ride, and yet it so much more than simply a ride. Gravity is a transcendental experience in cinema that is unlike anything we have seen before or are likely to see again anytime soon. It is breathtaking in every sense of the word, from its stunning portrayal of zero gravity in space to brutally heart-pounding sequences. As the film becomes layered with deeply existential questions concerning life, loss, and survival, Gravity becomes as consuming as its most thrilling scenes.\n\nGravity opens with a silently breathtaking shot of Earth from space, as if we are slowly orbiting it from afar. The scene subtly gravitates toward the Hubble telescope, where we meet astronauts Ryan Stone and Matt Kowalski, played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. They are on a repair mission on the telescope before being notified by NASA that the Russians have launched a missile at one of their own satellites. This anti-satellite test, however, has resulted in a massive amount of space debris that causes catastrophic damage to numerous satellites in the surrounding area. It is not long before Stone and Kowalski are told to abort the mission-the debris is rapidly heading straight toward them. Due to the velocity of the debris, they are unable to return to their shuttle before the maelstrom begins. In a scene that is equally beautiful and terrifying, the two astronauts fight for their lives in a shower of catastrophic destruction and silent explosions. After all, there is no sound in space.\n\nThe artistry of Gravity lies not only in large-scale shots of the vast universe and shattered space stations but in its detail as well, such as the subtle reflection of Earth's oceans on an astronaut's helmet or a small screw as it slowly gravitates off-screen. Director Alfonso Cuar√≥n provides a wholly unprecedented experience in Gravity, staying true to the scientific principles of space such as lack of sound and the surreal effects of zero gravity. Real astronauts, such as Buzz Aldrin and Michael J. Massimino, have acclaimed the film's realism, comparing it to their own experiences in space. Gravity is a film where the whole is truly greater than the sum of its parts, because when every detailed piece of the plot comes together, it creates a flawlessly phenomenal cinematic experience unlike any other. Gravity gleams in a year full of brainless, eye-candy films lacking substance, and it is too extraordinary to be missed.",

Alfonso Cuaron co-wrote and directed this heart-pounding thriller where the 1.5 hours flew by film aficionados. I concur with Liam Lacey of Globe and Mail who wrote: \"\"Gravity, a weightless ballet and a cold-sweat nightmare, intimates mystery and profundity, with that mixture of beauty and terror that the Romantics called the sublime.\" Exactly! Sandra Bullock steals the show as Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission and George Clooney is a veteran astronaut named Matt Kowalsky. During a spacewalk to fix a communications data port, tragedy strikes in the way of debris going so fast that can destroy anything on its path..The film continues from that point and I assure you that there is never a dull moment because there is constant action. I liked the fact that the story touches on spiritual themes and I will say this: even in space we have angels looking out for us, signs that we cannot ignore. It is up to us whether we continue the journey and fight for survival or giving up. GRAVITY IS ONE OF THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION FILMS IN YEARS AND it felt so real, so vivid. After watching this gem, you will feel apprehensive about our attempt to conquer outer space because the human race is so small, fragile, and incomparable to the harsh environment of outer space and its vastness. Two thumbs way up for this seven Oscar winner and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",

It is a film about the forces that control us set in an environment where we no longer have control and even our most high-tech equipment keeps us only nanometers or nanoseconds away from total annihilation.  \n\nGravity represents Cuaron's long-awaited re-entry (again, pun intended) into the cinematic arena.  His last film was dystopian masterpiece Children of Men.  Gravity does not quite reach the heights of Children of Men, but it is certainly a beautiful, masterfully directed, emotional, and suspenseful thrill ride. \n\nThe film is eye candy at its absolute best, but Cuaron also frames shots and directs his actors with perfectly artistic touches.  Still, the film runs the risk of being all surface and no depth.  Fortunately, Cuaron turns into a kind of existential fable about a woman trying to find meaning and purpose again in a world whose absurd cruelty had rendered her life vacant and pointless.  Her quest for survival in the harshest of conditions becomes a tale about the human will to live and the need to ascribe meaning and value to existence-it is a Sartrean quest for essence in the face of the crushingly absurd face of pure, absolute existence.  \n\nCuaron almost perfectly achieves his purpose, but the moves are a little bit too predictable for the film to be completely effective and original.  Still, Gravity is an amazing and intelligent experience from a truly accomplished master of the cinema.",

Director Alfonso Cuaron deserved the Oscar he received for creating not just a film, but an experience. He put the camera literally inside the helmets of the astronauts, making us feel what they felt. The event does not let up for one moment, making the audience feel constantly on edge.\n\nThe film's theme is intriguing to me, especially its Biblical applications. You don't really know what you'd do or Who you'd turn to in that kind of life-or-death situation. It's an illustration of the war adage that there are no atheists in foxholes. In times of sheer survival and insurmountable odds, most people hope for and look to something bigger than themselves to rescue them.\n\nIt's  as if we were all designed to have such hope...",

Basically, Sandra Bullock has learned several different ways to breathe heavy.  She delivers her lines no more brilliantly than she has in any other movie she has appeared in.  And well .. she did not get the Oscar.  The plot?  To me it is a stretch to believe that in the short time she had to train that she would be able to accomplish what she did in the American designed vehicle let alone any foreign made one.  The basic story line .. danger and/or possible death due to not being able to return to the safety of earth from space .. done before and far more effectively in say Apollo 13.  It just boggled my mind that this movie attained such critical success.  I found it boring and disappointing.",

First the good thing, and I say thing because there was literally only one thing that was good.The effects were cool. (But seriously, no better than the most recent Call of Duty video game! I swear)  And then there's the rest. Firstly, it seems to me that they said \"Hey let's make a film with 2 actors in it and another 2 who will just be disembodied voices. When it's over we'll have made $300 million dollars and only have to pay 3 people\" I am going to be picky here as I have always had a fascination with the space program and science in general. This film was in short, ridiculous. None of this shit could have happened in reality. Well, most of it anyway. As far as acting goes, it was horrible as well. George Clooney was in it for about 3 minutes. Not including the brief moronic dream sequence where he comes back in and makes some remarks about vodka. Really for all who don't know it, if you open a pressurized door like that, you'd be frozen solid and dead immediately, that's how I knew it was a dream and Clooney really wasn't there (I know I'm a observational genius!)\r\n\r\n       The rest of the time is spent watching Sandra Bullock float around in her underwear with an apparently endless supply of oxygen. Emotionally lacking as well \"I had a daughter, she fell and hit her head, and that was it\"  Well, she really was plumbing the depths of human emotion there. You'll wish you hit your head and went to sleep for rest of this film too. She then proceeds to jump into different space craft as if they were Toyota Corollas and she had the keys to all of them, she apparently speaks fluent Russian and Chinese or at least enough to fly all of their spacecraft effectively. Not bad for a Medical engineer? Oh yeah, that's right this is her first mission and she already knows everything about everything. Even more ridiculous was how she ship jumps and each time barely catches the handle (How thrilling.) as if there would be a film if she missed. And on to the final 2 bits of foolishness. 1. She actually used a fire extinguisher to fly around using the exhaust to function as her directional control. 2. She just jumps into the final craft to re-enter and all the conditions for re-entry are perfect. and she lands on a nice sandy beach, the end. Oh, and her quotes are fucking idiotic BTW, \"Either way it'll be one hell of a ride\". Really...? In the running for the best film of the year. I don't think so. More proof that these awards are fixed as they always have been. What a waste of time.",

Gravity is this: Seasoned Astronaut Matt Kowalsky and new engineer Ryan Stone are repairing the Hubble space satellite when out of nowhere they are hit by space debris, knocking them off comms and into space without any tethers, floating away into the further. Their mission now is to get back to Earth. This set-up simply expands as the stakes get higher, Alfonso Cuar√≥n is the new master of suspense and lump in your throat storytelling. Faultless writing, undeniably perfect visuals and a big sense of wonder all shot in 3D, one of the most fitting and finest uses of the technology, putting you on edge permanently. Let me tell you this now, the International Space Station sequence will absolute terrify, grip and shock you. Sandra Bullock is amazing, I cannot fault her, the sound of her panting in terror and the scenes where she reflects on her life and her uncertain future are the anchor for this movie, plus George Clooney's humour keeps you grounded amongst all the chaos. Steven Price's soundtrack is frantic and powerful enough to spin your head, echoing back to M83's beautiful score in Oblivion. Would I watch it again? Dumb question, this movie is watchable so many times and most definitely deserving of all it's Oscars. What will Cuar√≥n do next, that is the question?",

Or at least the story wasn't. This is not a bad thing though. In fact that is far from being a bad thing for this movie. Besides the movie couldn't have been done without the special effects. But it wasn't just the special effects either it was the camera work that worked perfectly in tandem with those special effects and it just gave me the feeling that I was floating in space alongside Ryan. Now lets move onto the thing I mentioned earlier: the story and characters. While those components of the movie weren't given the best of details, they were given enough detail that I was able to stay engaged with the characters and I cared about them enough to root for them because they were at least given some sort depth to their characters.

In my case, I had to watch it several times to fully uncover the whole second layer of the movie: what Alfonso Cuaron really wanted to tell. This is the story of a very depressed woman, who feels as if she is just drifting into a scary void (in the film: the space), and she can't find a reason to go on. Obstacles (debris) keep coming into her life and hitting her, and breaking everything around her. At some point, she finds the strength to keep fighting, and she learns a very important lesson: √É¬¢√Ç√ÇThe way I see it, there's only two possible outcomes. Either I make it and have one hell of a story to tell, or I burn up in the next ten minutes. Either way, whichever way. No harm no foul. Because either way, it will be one hell of a ride!√É¬¢√Ç√Ç? And she ends it with √É¬¢√Ç√ÇI'm ready√É¬¢√Ç√Ç?. So, yes, this to me is a very inspiring story about enjoying the ride of life no matter how hard it gets. In the end, there's only one life and it's ONE HELL OF A RIDE!",

But the whole of√Ç¬†Gravity√Ç¬†is beautiful in it's examination of life, and subsequently death. The cast of two involves the talent of Sandra Bullock (Ryan) and George Clooney (Matt). Ryan is overly motivated to maintain life (with a tragic death in her family); Matt is much more relaxed, and looks at life on a macro level. While both of their figurative homes are in space, one is more willing to stay there than the other. The film is intense, but I wasn't caught up in the technical, so for myself the drama aspect was where more of my admiration comes from. The birth/life/death symbolism in√Ç¬†Gravity√Ç¬†is great. While all the technical aspects interested me I'd give special props to director of photography Lubezki, who has previously impressed me with√Ç¬†Tree of Life√Ç¬†andChildren of Men. While this isn't my absolute favorite of 2013, I believe it'll be the most remembered.√Ç¬†\n\n3.5 stars+",

I rented this film expecting something amazing because I love space films, it had good reviews, and respectable actors. The reality is that it took a lot to contain my laughter. There is absolutely no plot or character development, so I felt no connection with the characters. The glossed over backstory of Ryan was not enough to make me feel anything for her. I need more than one sentence to do that. The dialogue was only a means to fill in the spaces between the numerous action sequences that are very hard to believe. When you make a movie or write a book about something that actually happens every day such as astronauts in space, then there should be a shred of reality to make it believable (even in fiction) and this movie doesn't have it. I know it is apparently supposed to be about someone trying to find a reason to live, but I've seen better. Ryan is probably the dumbest character I have ever seen in a movie. A lot of the problems she faces are her own doing which added to my annoyance. I'm sure on a big IMAX 3d screen this movie was epic because of the visuals, but it has nothing going for it on the small screen. Watch it if you are supremely bored. Otherwise, you can watch Armageddon, Sunshine, Mission to Mars, or Space Cowboys and actually be entertained on a more intelligent level and by intelligent I mean there is more to the films than just lights, camera, action.",

That same tagline could easily be effectively utilized for Alfonso Cuar√≥n's latest thriller, Gravity.\n\nStarring two unknowns by the names of George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, Gravity puts the two A-listers together as a medical engineer and an astronaut that must work in tandem to survive once a freak accident leaves them adrift in space.\n\nTheir struggle takes place after debris from a Russian satellite comes speeding through their orbit ripping their space shuttle to shreds causing Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) to float untethered in space. Coming to her aid is astronaut Matt Kowalsky (Clooney) who estimates that the debris will again circle the earth and again zip past their location in approximately 90-minutes. Their mission quickly changes into a race to survival 600km above the earth where help from anyone outside of each other is impossible.\n\nAlfonso Cuar√≥n is chiselling himself quite a career. He was last behind the camera for Children of Men (2006) which was nominated for three Academy Awards and he was also responsible for the best film in the Harry Potter film series with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004). But Gravity is his best work to date.\n\nBullock carries the film (expect some murmurs for a Best Actress nomination) and Gravity centers on the two main characters only. There are no other developed characters. Two other astronauts and a radio voice from Houston, Texas are the only other character influences and their parts wouldn't amount to 2 minutes if strung in order.\n\nWith only two actors to carry the entire 90-minute runtime, the movie relies heavily on its visuals of space and the various orbiting stations with the earth always prominent in the background. And the visuals are fantastic. There are no side-stories, sub-plots, unnecessary fluff or sexual tension between the characters. Just a desperate attempt to make the most of the oxygen they have left.\n\nGravity is the best 3D film ever. Ever. Add to the mix the incredible visuals and perfect sound (both loud and quiet) and you have a faultless mix. Gravity will contend for Oscar's in Visual Effects, Sound and Editing.\n\nCuar√≥n incredibly is able to give his audience a sense of claustrophobia whether his cast are inside an orbiting capsule or in the vast darkness of space. And as the astronauts deal with each new developing tragedy, the audience will themselves be gasping for air rooting for the character's success in each new attempt at survival.\n\nWith still a few months left in the year, it's too early to call a film the year's best. But Gravity will definitely be there on many lists at the year's conclusion. It's that breathtaking. It's that good.",

I honestly don't get it, there's nothing in the movie that invoked introspection (like the other 2), and as an action or drama it was pretty flat.\n\nAt least the effects were cool, looked realistic, and felt more like plot devices than the acting. 2 Stars just for the creative director winning at life.",

            "content": "Rating: 8/10\n\nOne such as me can't help but feel a great deal of excitement and anticipation when I see a film get critical reviews rating it in the 9 or above category and also see it receive 7 Oscars.  Oh, and that level of eagerness is only ratcheted up to 11 when said film is directed by the genius behind Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and Y Tu Mama Tambien.  I admit that going into my first viewing of this film, I had extremely high expectations.\n\nUltimately, Gravity is a good film.  And I mean that in the most disappointed sense of the word.\n\nMy high expectations proved to be far too high.  As high as the space this film is set within.  Alas, the movie doesn't reach such heights, and it really is a shame because it certainly looks like a film that is doing just that.  \n\nVisually speaking, Gravity is one of the most spectacular films I've ever seen.  The special effects are among the very best in film history.  No sci-fi film has ever made the awe, wonder, and horror of outer space come to life the way Gravity manages to.  It is a visual feast for the eyes and one of the very few films that is required viewing in 3D.  And that is where Gravity's greatness begins and ends, which is why the rest of it is so disappointing.\n\nMuch like its contemporary, Avatar, Gravity is an amazing looking film that has very little depth to it.  There are times where it feigns depth, still like Avatar, but with very little digging one finds little to chew on.  Yes, the horror and drama and action are engrossing and thankfully the film doesn't drag on and on, but it would've been nice to have something to talk about other than the film's special effects once the credits roll.  \n\nEven the performances aren't particularly noteworthy.  Yes, Sandra Bullock was nominated for Best Actress for this film, but I just don't see why.  She isn't bad at all.  She does her job well and believably, but nothing at all stands out about her role.  Clooney actually sticks out more in this film, and he's in it far less than Bullock.  However, he doesn't really stick out for good reasons.  In fact, one might say that Clooney's character illustrates everything wrong and disappointing about this film.  His character is the cookie-cutter veteran of his profession who spews out old cliches and stale platitudes about survival until he ultimately *SPOILER ALERT* dies to keep the newbie alive.  This is really all Gravity has to offer beyond its visuals: motivational survival speeches, \"Look how beautiful the view is\" cliches, and a lot of heavy breathing by Sandra Bullock.\n\nI know, I'm harping on this movie a lot, despite giving it a good score.  It is a good movie, but dammit it could have been great!  It should have been great!  I was told it was great!  Alas, it's just good.",

I was wondering what the hell the director was going to do for an hour and a half with someone floating in space, but after watching the film, I'm very impressed. I can now see what people are going on about! Sandra Bullock deserves all of the praise that she is getting for her performance. It couldn't have been easy to show emotion whilst floating from all of the place. The director cleverly added an in depth storyline to Bullocks character which made the movie watchable for everyone. The main thing that is great about the movie, has to be how the movie looks and feels. It's extremely realistic and you really do feel the intensity and emotion throughout the movie. The director has definitely upped the bar in Hollywood. A Great Watch!\n\nRound-Up:\nI honestly can say that I haven't seen a movie like this before. The closest movie that I can think of was Moon which was also based on one character stuck in space, but this concentrates on Bullocks journey to earth. When the debris hit that spaceship, it really did look amazing, which made me think how great it must have look in 3D or in the cinema. Anyway, this I some of those movies that I can watch over and aver again, which is very rare for me. The only problem that I personally found with the film was the ending, but that's just me being picky. \n\nBudget: $100million\nWorldwide Gross: $708million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there emotional space movies about a woman's journey down to earth. 8/10",

However this movie just puts the fear in you- its terrifying in a \"this could maybe happen to someone\" kind of way. And it's visually stunning. I imagine its even better in IMAX or 3D, but it was quite powerful on my own TV. Really great thriller/suspense movie.",

The script or dialogue doesn't have much of an attractive driving force to keep you engaged for 2 hours however the visual and the action sequences of destruction and mayhem holds your attention. It's like witnessing a beautiful train wreck as Sandra Bullock gives a gut wrenching performance just on her physical and facial expressions. George Clooney, cool, calm, collected-he acts as her coach and conscience throughout the film. He achieves this with reckless abandon but in a precisely delivered way. Now, on to the orchestra-- simply fits the action sequences like a hand in a glove --riveting but not over powering. I could say this film was slightly overrated but it was a thrill ride, a different pace, a distinctive perspective from director Alfonso Cuar√≥n. His approach and outlook on space and the element of weightlessness is so surreal that it's invitingly sickening. How can this be so real, so genuine? Some acts felt a little expansive, a little too filler-- especially when Sandra is alone at the space station. However, after I finished and reflected on the sequences, script and pace of the film-the reasons why Alfonso Cuar√≥n calculatingly  directed those painfully slow quiet monologues with Sandra alone or communicating with a foreigner via radio was completely understandable. I think this film was slightly overrated but a flat out thrill ride nonetheless. A must have in any Blu Ray collection!",

            "content": "*SPOILERS* \r\nGravity, being hailed as a cinematic masterpiece and expected to be the \"Greatest Space Movie of All Time\" - James Cameron. The audience and critic response however was hugely mixed. Although yes, some agree with the Cameron, and did completely adore the new space epic, the others were massively disappointed. Unfortunately, I am one of the dissatisfied viewers. \r\n\r\nHaving seen the trailers and being amongst the massive hype for Gravity, of course I could not wait to see the movie on the big screen. In fact, I actually planned to skip the opening weekend and visit an even bigger screen, London's IMAX. Unfortunately, (for the time) I was gutted to have missed the screening, which resulted in me watching the 2D version. Now, yes I do suggest that I would have written a slightly more positive review if I had indeed watched the film in 3D, considering the new use of technologies won it an astonishing 7 Oscars. However, I did not. And in a way I am pleased, because the experience showed me how little the overestimated film had to offer other than the visuals. \r\n\r\nI usually would give a film the benefit of the doubt and suggest that maybe if the enormous hysteria wasn't so enormous, then I wouldn't have had such high expectations and would therefore not be as disappointed. However, I don't believe this. Gravity lacked exciting narrative, character development and emotional involvement. Having enjoyed the Mexican director, Alfonso Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001) due to the deep character development and emotional manipulation, I expected more with Gravity. There was not one moment within the film that made me feel sorry or scared for Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), which is also surprising considering I respect Bullock as an actress. Awkwardly, I did not find myself wanting Stone to get out of any situations or even returning home. Other than one underdeveloped story she reluctantly tells Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) about losing her daughter, there is no reason we would want Stone to return home. Regarding both Bullock and Clooney as remarkable actors, the film and narrative did not do either of them justice. They were boring characters with no need or desire to get home safely. \r\n\r\nPlot holes. There are many I could discuss but I will only mention a few. Bullock, for a lot of the screen time, is untethered, spinning and whirling around space. This is highly unlikely as NASA provide an emergency pack, which is programmed to automatically adjust, roll and pitch to stop the astronaut from spinning. It is routine that the jet pack will then be manually taken control of and used to return to the space vehicle. It is also known that there is no sound in space, which the audience is also reminded at the very start of the film. However, we hear the wrench actuating when used by Bullock in the very exposition. \r\n\r\nSomething that really infuriated me was the resolution. What could be more dissatisfying than seeing Bullock crawl to the surface of what looks like another abandoned land. There is nobody to help her, nothing to make us feel relief or happiness that she is back on Earth. The only positive is that is actually humorous watching Bullock learn how to walk again. Other than that, the ending is nothing but another boring and frustrating scene in a movie full of them. \r\n\r\nI can't help but replay the moment where Bullock is barking to a Chinese man from inside her isolated space vessel. Barking. Like a Dog. I understand that Bullock is at the end of her tether and is convinced she is on her deathbed. However I do not think this is a valid enough reason. This is completely embarrassing for Bullock and the director. Alone and scared, Stone finds herself on her space radio and finds herself in contact with a man in China when trying to find help. He doesn't understand a word on English so Stone ends up finding comfort in the mans dog. Strange, I know. Bullock spends the next moments barking to the dog and to make things weirder, we then hear an uncomfortable cry from a baby. Although the majority of the films are completely predictable, this certainly was not. During this scene Bullock also curls up in the fetus-like stance and whirls round and round. This could not be more of an obvious symbolism. \r\n\r\nAll round, Gravity was predictable and highly overrated (in my opinion of course). Cuaron and his son spent an amazing 6 years paying so much time and effect perfecting the visuals and hiring two insanely famous actors to add bankability to their movie. However during this process, they completely forgot about the attention they needed to have been paying to the plot, dialogue and characters. No wonders there are doubts about the 1969 moon landing.

            "content": "A long time ago a made a shitty video review on Gravity so I decided to settle my thoughts once and for all with my writing.  I still stand by that it's pretty good and a must see in the theaters but I refuse to call it the Citizen Cane of space dramas.  \n\nFirst off it goes without saying that Gravity created a great space environment.  The triple threat of the directing, music, and special effects would end up making such a harsh environment so believable.  Little details like having muffled or no sound in space and long continuous shots are to thank for that.  Like do you realize how insane it is to have a shot lastly for over 10 to 15 minutes in the beginning?  It's great film making by any standard and Cuaron rightly earned that Oscar.  \n\nI wish I could give the same praise to the writing and acting but I have to be honest.  Let me start off by saying that if you're going to have minimal characters in a movie then it's reasonable to expect greater acting and character development (ex Shame).  To be blunt, Sandra Bullock doesn't live to that expectation or her character Ryan Stone.  Now I know judging a performance can be pretty subjective but keep in mind she wasn't the movies first choice or the seconds (third's time the charm?).  I find it distracting when she's not consistently shivering in a freezing station because you know, that's how our bodies work?  Kind of makes it more obvious her breath was done in post production.  Keep stuttering 'no,' that'll convey how terrified or frustrated you are.  Many claustrophobic tend to injury themselves out of frustration and you'd think that being trapped in space of all places we would see that.  Kind of think of it they also feel nauseated and hyperventilate (she does more so when she's spinning).  After all that spinning she doesn't throw up or hyperventilate (as much) when's she's trapped in a station.  It only shows, you know, her humanity which makes for better development.  Her performance wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. \n\nNo complaints with George Clonney's performance even though he was playing George Clooney (figurative statement).  (Mid-spoiler in this section) However, there's an expectation to feel emotional for his character when he's only in the movie for a little under one third of it that I just don't care.  The movie is only 90 minutes and there's only so much you can do with that running time. \n\nDoes anyone else not find it incredibly stupid when George Kowalsky Clooney tells Stone to stop talking to preserve Oxygen but keeps persisting that she tell her story.  Like oh no you're running low on Oxygen, but first, tell me/audience about your daughter.   Thanks for the obvious symbolism that you held the shot on for a good minute just to tell about her rebirth and innocence (kind of cool).  Thanks Stone for telling me the debris is coming, and how much time you have left, and that you see the other station.  Towards the end Stone even tells us literally and thematically her situation which would need me spoiling it.  All I'll say it has to do with that daughter story, you might now what I'm talking about if you've seen the movie already.\n\nIt got a little repetitive going to different stations twice and she would just barely grab the last bar or object.  One scene it happens twice where she barely grabs the end of her rope to just barely hang at the end of that parachute.  I would list more but I want to keep spoiler to a minimum.  You start to lose some of the suspense when you overuse that trick.   \n\nBeyond that it's nitpicking (or me being an asshole).  I'm not going to pretend I know everything about space but call me crazy I doubt a fire hydrant will work Wall-E style.  Some of the 3D felt gimmicky, like grabbing a wrench at the audience for the second time.  Is it really appropriate to have her tear drop in 3D during an emotional scene?  Unless you're really going to argue me the artistic value of that. \n\nAfter all of that it might sound I hate it but no I still enjoyed myself a lot.  It was a theater experience I'll remember and would recommend you watch it there if you haven't.  If I ever get the chance I'll pick it up on blu-ray which is something I consider an honor.  If this was your favorite movie of 2013 I have no problem with that.  Like I said, don't pretend it's the Citizen Cane of space dramas or an excellent character study.  I didn't mean to bash it but it gets enough praise as it is.  7/10.",

The ending did get me a little, but hey that's a good thing right? To all of the haters out there who thought that this didn't deserve nearly as much credit as it did at the oscars, I say watch it again. Although I could pretty much guess everything that was going to happen, the way the story was told through a variety of long takes, visual cues played through reflections, absence of audio, and many more really nicely used filmmaking techniques made it a perfectly executed way to tell the story of someone helplessly floating around in the vastness of space. The acting from Sandra Bullock was really believable as well, George Clooney's character was a little nonchalant about the whole situation, (I guess that's his character but still...) I still really enjoyed his performance. I thought that keeping Earth in the background of almost all of the shots also was a really awesome choice by the filmmakers because it really showed that they are so close to earth, but at the same time they are in a whole different world entirely. Great job, and congrats on the oscar awards.",

Most the space films are always full of greeny or blueshy stupid aliens , odd form of spaceship, and frekey people swim and walking in space without speed limit. The power of Gravity is that no heroes, there are no 1,2,3 acts in the storytelling, and there are no rules flowing the 180 degree. In Gravity I see a new Sovite style of editing, the film powerfully use of 3D with completely than other films. With unquestionable great of camera movements,the the promising filmmaker Afonso Coron did his film, with  a new point-view in cinema to the space. He makes film that we never see it before in the  history of the cinema. This film offers simply the best entreatment in term of visually aspect. The film genuinely deals with CGI technology in smart way. Making film that so real with CGI is hard. Many films in the 3D cinema have bad results in term of 3D. The three-dimensional team in Gravity  difanes how to use the animation to reveals the humanity, not just to make us scream or shook.  For first time in history of the 3D cinema, the film crow use 3D models appears to your seat in about ONLY less than 5% of the total shots, that is a difficult choice.\n\nAs the great Ang Lee's (Life of Pi). and before that Martin scoresesse's (Hugo) this film is about part of a movement, I would argue, that called the  renaissance. It changes how people should think inside holwood in term of making films with 3D modles. Many people don't like the story in Gravity, some people find it silly, don't make any sense, and full of sadness. Let's talk about that for a second, with this film we been conditioned with more than 100 years of making, watching, and reading about space, and science fiction films about specific treatment; lots of actions with fast cuts in the montage, most of the films with a leading man, and procedure of filmmking that follows the rules. That is why Gravity so effective. Meticulously story in the film is not just about the lead lady, is more about human being, the way we think, cry, and love in a critical moments. Consecutively the film give us a work of art, in cinema that we should deal with it as Data new form of filmmaking. \n\nThe montage is highly stylize with timing,the long shots that Alfonso preferred to keeps it, there for not to distract the viewer. He also maintains the tension and excitement in the action scenes. Coron keeps us know that space flight is not for tourism as CNN or BBC used to told us all the time. This Latino director lets his camera talk instead of his storytelling, he rebells in the montage as the Russians did before, breaking the rules of the shots, as in the French wive filmmakers did. Wather we like the film, or dislike, we should identify the key in this film in which; It is a different from all the past cinema in Hollywood, and invites many young people to learn more about great use of cinematic shots through the revolution of the 3D.",

This film has been widely hailed as being scientifically accurate, when in fact it has scenes that contravene the most basic laws of physics; a characteristic that I found disturbing as it shows up how scientifically illiterate our culture really is. What bothers me about this film is not that it is fantasy, which I can enjoy, but that it is fantasy that purports to be scientific. \n\nI did some research and found out that the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier explained that the scene where Clooney cuts himself loose from Bullock to save her (itself a tired Hollywood cliche) was necessary because the cord she was tethered to was still absorbing their kinetic energy, which apparently was so enormous it would have caused the lines to fail and would have doomed them both had he not cut loose. Well, first of all the kinetic energy could not have been very great because they were each able to hold on to the line connecting them with one hand without apparent strain. Secondly unless the cord that Bullock had her leg entangled in was supper stretchy, like miles and  mies of stretch, (I did not see it stretch at all) the kinetic energy of the shock load would have been either absorbed or caused the line to fail almost immediately. But the two have a conversation for a full minute (I timed it) before he cuts himself loose. This is as nonsensical as jumping up in the air (in earth gravity) and hanging out up there at the deadpoint for more than a full minute before falling back down - the physics of cartoons.  As a rock climber I have taken numerous falls on a climbing rope (which does stretch) and I know that the shock load (which I could not possibly hold with one or even both hands) is dissipated quickly - probably in less than a second. I guess that next time my partner catches me in a fall though I should worry about Mr. Grazier's mysterious energy that is going to keep pulling on me and break the rope. \n\nThe movie is full of ridiculous scenes like this, which could not possibly happen except in some alternate universe with completely different laws of physics. This film is much closer to Plan Nine from Outer Space than masterpieces like 2001 and Apollo 13. Ed Wood, I'm sure, would have loved it.",

            "content": "I remember seeing the trailer for this about a year ago, and just judging from that a couple things stuck out to me. \n1.  Sandra Bullock's constant panting and screaming drove me mad. \n2.  When the astronauts bounced around it looked really funny.  \nNow that I've seen the actual film in full, those two things turned out to be completely accurate.  \n\nLets just dive in.  Gravity's biggest positive is also its biggest negative; the CGI and visuals.  This film has been praised beyond belief for its visual effects, and I will agree they are very impressive.  The fact that the camera seems to be completely free-roaming throughout the entire duration really helps put you IN the scenes.  I didn't see it in 3D but apparently you feel like you're actually there, which I can believe because just watching it on a regular TV like I did, there were times where I felt myself getting a little nauseous.  The visual effects are very good, and the Earth especially looks beautiful in every shot.  I can understand why it took almost 3 years for the thousands of people working on the visuals to finish everything and they definitely deserve their Oscar for it.  \n\nBut getting past the aesthetics of the film, what are we left with?  The answer is not much.  The plot itself isn't new, we've seen it done time and time again, astronauts stranded in space fighting the odds in order to survive.  Lets remember Apollo 13 with Tom Hanks.  That film is far far superior to Gravity and it manages to be so without amazing special effects.  The reason why is because it has a strong human element.  Yeah, I'll admit that maybe because it was based off a true story meant it had more emotional gravity (LOL)  but the fact remains a film made in 1995, centred around pretty much the same sorts of events, manages to be better than a technological masterclass from 2013.  \n\nGravity is almost revolutionary with its 3D and visual effects, but so what!?  It's more of a sit-in simulator you find at a theme park than it is a film.  For me personally, if you don't have a strong human centre, you can have all the brilliant graphics and computer toys you want, you're not really impressing me.  I didn't care about Sandra Bullock's character, I wasn't routing for her, and to be perfectly honest just like I thought when watching the trailer, I found her extremely annoying throughout.  The noises she makes and her constant whimpering and screaming made me wish she WOULD die!  George Clooney plays George Clooney, nothing to see here, but the film lost something when his character got killed off.  The dialogue is cheesy and cliche, and I feel that they could have made the film a lot more tense if they cut most of it out.  Less is more.  If we had Sandra Bullock shut up for 5 minutes and silently contemplate the situation instead of constantly chatting to herself and trying to give herself motivational pep talks, I might have been more involved.  \n\nA lot of people really like Gravity, and I'm not saying I think it's particularly bad, but I will admit that the scale of its popularity and critical acclaim really bothers me because it's clear as day that when Alfonso Cuaron and co. began pre-production, they probably thought, \"Alright, lets make it LOOK really really really good, and you know, everything else will probably fall into place..or something..\" Sorry, but no.  Special effects should be used to enhance a story, they should never BE the story.  This should be considered as a decent thriller with impressive effects, but the fact it won 7 Oscars is quite frankly a joke.  It's nothing new.  It's not even an improved version of a tried and tested formula.  \n\nOverall; yeah, great visuals, nobody can deny.  The hard work and thousands of man hours really show as the effects are masterfully executed.  But scratch beneath the shiny surface and we've seen it all before.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but if I can't identify with anything I see on screen I'm not going to sing the praises of the film, and for me I just couldn't get involved with the human side of things.  I guess the best way to describe it would be... *Shrugs shoulders*",

            "content": "Cinema fans rejoice. Gravity is my favorite film of 2013, one of your favorite films of 2013, and one of the critics' favorite films of 2013. I think it's also safe to say that Gravity is also now one of my favorite films in recent years. Alfonso Cuaron deserves one hell of a round of applause. This movie is incredible. Words can't explain the amazement. \n\nGravity is a sci-fi outer space techno-thriller directed by Prisoner of Azkaban and Children of Men helmer Alfonso Cuaron, who co-wrote Gravity's script with his son, Jonas Cuaron. This film was in development since 2010. It was to star Angelina Jolie and Robert Downey, Jr. as the lead roles. However, Jolie dropped out to direct In the Land of Blood and Honey, which was a great film. Multiple actresses then auditioned for the female lead role, like Scarlett Johansson, Blake Lively, Marion Cotillard, and Natalie Portman. Sandra Bullock was then chosen for the role. Robert Downey, Jr. dropped out to do Iron Man 2, Due Date, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, Marvel's The Avengers, and Iron Man 3, so he was replaced by Danny Ocean himself, George Clooney. \n\nFilmed digitally on a budget of exactly $100 million, which was a bit lower than the usual 3D/CGI film (The Hobbit, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Avatar, Star Trek), the film was shot by expert cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. Father and son Cuaron intended the film to be as scientifically accurate despite a few inaccuracies and exaggerations. For example, in the movie, the explosions and falling debris crashing into things are completely non-audible. Warner Bros. Pictures made the action audible in the trailers to make the movie appear more exciting. In 2013, Gravity was released in IMAX and Real-D theaters everywhere, in the beginning of slasher icon month. \n\nGravity involves bio-medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone, played wonderfully by Sandra Bullock, who's on her first space mission. Joining her is to-be-retired veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, played by George Clooney. Clooney does a great job playing this character and the dialogue helps Clooney and Bullock's performances. It amazes me...in the GOOD way. I really like the opening shot of this film and how it lasts for like fifteen-or-so minutes. What kept me invested was Alfonso Cuaron's brilliant direction and Emmanuel Lubezki's beautiful cinematography. Lubezki's cinematography beats out Larry Smith's cinematography for Only God Forgives. Oh, yeah. I went there, motherfuckers. \n\nSo, as Ryan, Matt, and the other members of the crew of the spaceship Explorer get into space, falling satellite debris crashes into the ship during a spacewalk. Let me just talk about the 3D and the special effects for a second. They are stunning. They are just unbelievably gorgeous. The CGI and special effects are absolutely remarkable, quite possibly some of the best I've seen since Avatar. The 3D actually works in this film. I saw this in IMAX 3D yesterday (opening day), and I honest to God felt like I was actually in space. To quote a line Sandra Bullock says in this movie: it's terrifyingly beautiful. I also found it very clever how they got Mission Control to be voiced by Ed Harris, in a reference to another wonderful outer space film: Ron Howard's classic, Apollo 13. \n\nBack to the story, and be warned because there's a shit-ton of spoilers ahead, Stone and Kowalski are now floating in space with a limited amount of air. The debris hits other satellites, causing a chain reaction of destruction until the satellites necessary for them to communicate with Mission Control in Houston are also destroyed. Even though they don't receive messages from Mission Control, both Kowalski and Stone continue to transmit in the blind to Mission Control, in the hopes that Mission Control can hear them. \n\nStone tumbles out of control after separating from the shuttle's cargo bay arm. Kowalski, who's wearing a thruster pack as part of his spacesuit, navigates to Stone and retrieves her. They tether together, and make their way back to Explorer, where they discover the shuttle has been damaged beyond repair, and the rest of their crew is dead. They then decide to use the thruster pack to make their way to the ISS, which is nearby in orbit. Kowalski sets the timer on his suit for an hour and a half, estimating the debris that destroyed Explorer will orbit the Earth and come back around in that amount of time. \n\nKowalski's ever calm and efficient in the crisis, continuing to reassure Stone that they'll both make it back to Earth safely. En route to the ISS, they discuss Stone's life back home and the death of her young daughter in a schoolyard accident. As they approach the ISS, it's clear that the ISS crew has evacuated due to the debris field causing damage. One Soyuz module for delivering ISS crew and returning them to Earth is missing, used by the ISS crew to evacuate the station. The other Soyuz module has been damaged, and its landing parachute has been deployed as a result. It becomes clear that the remaining Soyuz module can't return them to Earth safely. \n\nAs they approach the ISS they realize they have almost no air left and only one thruster burst remaining in Kowalski's pack. They bounce off the many parts of the ISS as they attempt to grab on at their accelerated speed relative to the station. Stone is able to grab onto the ISS for a moment, however, Kowalski's momentum yanks Stone away from the ISS. As they both bounce off the ISS further, a solar wind they pass severs the tether holding the two together. At the last moment, Stone's leg becomes entangled in parachute cords connected to the Soyuz reentry module, and is able to grab hold of the tether connected to Kowalski. His additional mass stretches the parachute cords entangled to Stone's leg to nearly break free because the damaged ISS is losing altitude and the rarefied air molecules are beginning to exert too much drag on both astronauts. He sacrifices himself for her survival and unclips his strap, floating away. \n\nWhen Kowalski sacrificed himself to save Ryan's life, I was nearly in tears. This is one of the most emotional scenes I've ever seen in a film. This film handles its emotional grounding superbly. Never was it overdrawn nor was it forced. It was perfect, along with the screenplay. Father and son Cuaron have a supreme amount of talent. It's amazing. So amazing that it can't be put into words. \n\nBack to the plot, Stone indeed floats easily back to the ISS now. Kowalski's still in radio contact with her, asking Stone about her minimal piloting training and instructs Stone to use the Soyuz capsule to travel to the nearby Chinese space station Tiangong by using the small maneuvering rockets to navigate, even though the reentry vehicle itself can't return to earth due to the prematurely deployed parachute. Kowalski says that even if the Chinese have evacuated, she can use the remaining return module that's based on the design of the Soyuz, and Stone's limited training will get her home safely. \n\nStone boards the ISS, which has been damaged but still has breathable air. Stone makes her way to the Soyuz module, but a fire starts from sparking wires aboard the ISS. She tries vainly to put out the fire, and finally gets aboard the Soyuz. Once aboard, Stone undocks the module and proceeds to fire the thruster, but the parachute cables of the Soyuz are tangled to the ISS, keeping the Soyuz from getting free. Stone puts on one of the Soyuz spacesuits and spacewalks outside to release the parachute cables from the capsule. An hour and a half has passed and during the spacewalk, the satellite debris approaches again, impacting with the ISS and the Soyuz. Stone barely makes it inside the Soyuz in time, just as the debris field impacts and destroys the ISS, but the Soyuz module manages to break free of the ISS. \n\nStone goes over the emergency manual, and uses the thrusters to line the Soyuz up with Tiangong. She attempts to fire the main Soyuz rocket to navigate to Tiangong; however, the fuel tanks are empty. Stone tries to use the Soyuz radio to contact Earth, but she's only able to reach a farmer who doesn't speak English on a short wave frequency. Stone resigns herself to her fate of dying, and instead of waiting to die from excruciating carbon dioxide poisoning, she slowly begins decompression in the cabin to commit suicide by the painless hypoxia. She begins to fall asleep, running out of oxygen, when she sees Kowalski outside the capsule. Kowalski enters the capsule, to Stone's amazement. Stone tells him that there's no fuel left for the navigation rockets, but Kowalski, ever the optimist, tells Stone that the capsule still has reentry rockets for the touchdown procedure. These will be just as useful for navigating to Tiangong. \n\nKowalski's suddenly gone and Stone realizes she hallucinated him in her oxygen-deprived state. She turns the oxygen flow back on in the Soyuz and implements the information about the landing thrusters she remembered from her hallucination, firing the thrusters, making her way to Tiangong. Realizing she's gonna miss the station by several dozen meters, Stone picks up a fire extinguisher and opens the Soyuz hatch while the capsule's still pressurized, blowing her across the distance. She navigates to Tiangong using the fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster. Stone boards Tiangong just as the entire station, having been pushed out of its stable orbit by the satellite debris, starts to burn up on the upper edge of the atmosphere. Stone successfully enters the re-entry commands in the Chinese capsule Shenzhou's computer, and Shenzhou begins its descent towards Earth. On the way down, Stone hears Mission Control over the radio tracking the capsule while rescue teams are being dispatched. \n\nShenzhou splashes down in a lake in an uninhabited part of the Earth. Stone opens the capsule hatch, but the water rushing in nearly drowns her, pinning her against the back wall. Once the water pressure equalizes, she swims out, but sinks with the weight of her spacesuit. She successfully slips out of her spacesuit and swims to the surface with the last of her breath. She swims to shore watching the remains of Tiangong and other satellite debris as they burn up high in the sky overhead. Stone pulls herself ashore with difficulty and takes her first shaky steps on dry land, gradually adjusting to the Earth's gravity. And the film ends there. \n\nFINAL SCORE: 10/10 \n\nGravity is masterful in all areas. The writing is stellar, the direction is superb, the visual effects are awe-inspiring, the 3D is great, the production design is breathtaking, the cinematography is beautiful, the music score by Steven Price is brilliant, and Sandra Bullock and George Clooney's performances are wonderful. This is sure to make everybody's top 10 of 2013 list, and it is guaranteed to be nominated for and win tons of Oscars and Golden Globes.",

            "content": "I was rooting for the debris field the entire movie.  The best thing that could have happened was for all the astronauts to get taken out in the first scene. I would have given it three stars just for that alone but after seeing how bad it was in its entirety I'd up it to five stars if they had just killed them off early.\n\nLet me start by writing that I am a huge scifi fan, certainly more scifi than fantasy as well.  Unfortunately this movie is so ridiculously unrealistic it was insulting.  Almost nothing in that movie could or would actually happen the way it was presented.  This was not a fantasy movie, it was a fictional movie based on real science, except they threw the laws of physics, the very basics of science, out the window.\n\nThe acting was drab and uneventful, and the dialog lacked anything needed to keep me interested.  I was incredibly annoyed the whole film.  It was not suspenseful.  Even worse, I knew the outcome, she would survive.  Isn't anyone bold enough to make a movie where the good guy doesn't win?  The on film that did it, Invasion of the Body Snatchers remake, gets a five star from me for doing just that.  I wsh they had done the same here.  It would have been the only redeeming quality of the film.\n\nThe special effects were good, but not jaw-dropping or revolutionary.  there were better films this year.  I also do not know why the film got nominated for any Oscars frankly, it was that bad.\n\nMy friend said that apparently the Academy is in love with anything that George Looney Clooney touches so perhaps that explains it.  I see the critics loved it.  That says a lot too...  \n\nWasting my time on this awful film annoyed me enough but then seeing it get nominated made that worse.  Winning all those Oscars just made me tip the scales with cynicism about the world.  If this kind of film can get such wonderful praise I'm afraid to think about what other movies are in store for the future.\n\nRemember when society was terribly concerned about the youth of the 60s, 70s and 80s and pondered how the world would be when they grew up?  Well one thing is for sure, apparently all those kids ended up on the set of this film...",

It is the classic 'woman in peril' with a difference, and boasts some of the best 3D CGI ever. And that is it. Not for 1 second does anyone expect SB to die, but how she is going to survive this ordeal (with a few minor abrasions. The pitiful script even has the nerve to use the famous 'I've' got a bad feeling about this' from Star Wars. Now the newer Star Wars films were pilloried for too much CGI, poor acting and trite scripts. They are like the works of Shakespeare compared to this silly effort, a B movie with A production values.\n\nDisappointing, unless you were expecting nothing but effects, but I was not disappointed at all.",

            "content": "I know, I know - the movie released ages ago. So why am I giving my review now? Well, for one thing, the movie is still running in theatres. But, more importantly, it's a movie that redefines the movie going experience. It very successfully does what few movies do nowadays - leave you in awe. I recently saw the movie for a second time, and I was as moved as I was the first time. And now that I am back to writing reviews, I just had to write this one.\n\nStarring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, and directed by the brilliant Alfonso Cuaron (it will be a disappointment if he doesn't win the Best Director Oscar for this one), \"Gravity\" is essentially a ship-wreck survival story set in space. Medical engineer Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) and veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney) are part of the shuttle Explorer's STS-157 mission. During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Station telescope, Mission Control in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on an inoperative satellite, which has caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of space debris. High speed debris strikes the Explorer, killing all the team-members except Stone and Kowalski, who are stranded in space. The movie is about their attempt to get back to earth.\n\nThe movie works on every level - it is a tense thriller, and at the same time a story about the triumph of human will against seemingly insurmountable odds. And a big reason it works is the acting. It's not an understatement that the acting rests squarely on the able shoulders of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney (they are, after all, the only actors in the movie - ignoring the voice actors). Clooney hits all the notes playing the wise-cracking Kowalski - he oozes charm and wit, but still conveys the experience of a veteran, and the concern and caring for Dr. Stone. As for Sandra Bullock, she gives a great, nuanced performance as Dr. Ryan Stone - from the nervousness of the character, to the sheer panic, to the despair, to the resolve to survive - the journey of the character has been portrayed beautifully.\n\nOf course, I have to devote some words for the special effects, which are in a league of their own. This film makes the best use of 3D I have ever seen - hands down. The scenes where the debris is hurtling towards the screen would have most audiences ducking. If a movie had technology specifically made for it, you can imagine it would be worth something. A lot of the stuff on screen would have been very difficult to pull off, and it definitely pays off. The movie is visually stunning, and the vastness of space contrasted with the claustrophobic feeling of being in cramped spaces gives so much more depth to the scenes. For me, the experience I had was almost as if I was also floating in space.\n\nAt the end of the day, this movie is all about the director. Cuaron delivers another believable science fiction movie (if you haven't seen \"Children of Men\", I would highly recommend it) with a taut screenplay, and great attention to detail - I read that the science is pretty accurate (though I wouldn't know, and it really doesn't matter for a regular movie-goer). And of course there's his love for long continuous scenes - just pay attention to the first scene, it's 13 minutes long! There are a lot of beautiful shots, and despite all its technical brilliance, there is no compromise in the story or the characters. And the one thing that shines through is Alfonso Cuaron's assured touch which makes, what could have been a really simple and ordinary movie, an extraordinary piece of work.\n\nIf you still haven't seen Gravity, change that immediately. If you have seen Gravity, but not in 3D - change that immediately. This movie is a cinematic landmark, one that will stay on in your minds long after you have left the theatre.\n\n\nP.S.: Once you see the movie, you may want to check out the short \"Aningaaq\".",

            "content": "There is no other film experience on Earth like Gravity. Which makes sense, keeping in mind the whole movie was located in space, with only the ending scene being on Earth.\n\n Alfonso Cuaron has struck gold with his masterpiece Gravity. It explores the silence of space where all you can hear are your breaths and your thoughts as you spin around aimlessly. This is usually harmless until a crisis like debris comes into play. From then on, Sandra Bullock puts on an amazing performance which will definitely give her an Oscar nod, and George Clooney is his usual affable self.\n\n One thing that really defined this movie's greatness was its careful attention to being realistic. From the tears slipping down Sandra Bullock's cheeks actually floating off her face, to the oxygen in her suit depleting at a steady rate, this movie doesn't look over any detail or flaw. Instead, it uses simplicity and directness to flow the movie along. Nothing was that unbelievable in this movie.\n\n Even though sound was a luxury in this movie, the emotional side of the film was not. Confined to tight spaces, Bullock couldn't really do anything to hide her emotions. She couldn't run anywhere to hide, or walk into a different room. Instead, we all saw and felt what she was going through, and actually cared about what happening to her character.\n\n Another thing this movie did that was great was switch perspectives of the camera. We went from seeing what was happening from the character's eyes, to a third person view, to a wide camera angle, all in a few seconds. And the best part is, the camera was so fluent and coherent that we didn't even notice that the perspectives were changing until it actually happened. Genius filmmaking.\n\n I could go on about this things this movie did right, because to be honest I can't think of anything I didn't like in the movie, which is extremely rare. Overall, this is a new kind of cinema experience that cannot be replicated again. (Yes, that was a challenge, directors!) Everyone in the target audience and beyond should see this movie because of its realistic sense of things and its careful attention to detail. The cinematography is beautiful, and the views and perspectives this movie gives are to die for. The emotional core, themes, and moral lessons this movie offers should be soaked up with ease. And the way it draws you into the story and what's happening is truly an amazing feat.",

Even the special effects everyone raves about while good, were not much more advanced that 2001. In fact, as I think back, they weren't even that good. Kubrick had a spareness of scene that well matched the infinity of space. Gravity tried, but it never rose to that level of the sublime.",

            "content": "This film is an absolute masterpiece and a work of art that needs to be seen.  Technically, this film is easily one of the most impressive films I have ever seen.  The special effects are absolutely outstanding and create an incredible sense of immersion, and the film didn't even cost THAT much to begin with.  It had $100 million budget, not counting the money spent on marketing, and I'm pretty sure a good chunk of that was eaten up by getting both Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, which probably got this funded in the first place.  I'm sure Clooney didn't command as much as he usually does considering that his role in the film isn't as meaty as Sandra's.  That makes the effects of the film far more impressive, when you take into consideration how other SFX-heavy movies cost more to make but only look half as good as this film does.  I'm not sure if I could go out of my way and say that this film's effects are revolutionary, considering that movies abusing special effects have been the norm for almost 20 years, so because of that it isn't exactly rare, as it was when Star Wars first came out, to see a film with heavy use of special effects.  That's the only reason I can think of for why the film's effects won't be looked as revolutionary, even though they actually are.  This is the most realistic and believable portrayal of space in any movie I've ever seen.  I can only imagine how impressive this film must've been on the big screen, in an IMAX theater for example.  It would've captured the incredible scope of space much more accurately than a 28-inch screen HDTV.  And the film's story, looking at it without thinking about all the allegories and the symbolism, looking at it as a story of survival in the face of impossible odds.  This is THE worst situation you could probably find yourself in, being stuck in space with all the comms systems down, having your space station destroyed by debris flying at 50,000 miles per hour, and this debris will continue to fly by every 90 minutes after it completes its orbit, and finding yourself in a situation where you, in your first mission, have to find a way to make it back to earth without anybody to help you or guide you through it.  That doesn't sound like a situation anybody would want to find themselves in.  The film sees Murphy's Law, everything that can go wrong will, and turns the knob up to 11.  The film's intensity is heightened by the fact that there is absolutely no way for noise to travel in space, so seeing Stone trying to detach a chute from her module, that she will use to try and reach the Chinese space station, as she's completely unaware of the debris completely destroy the Russian station is absolutely horrifying.  But there's also the contrast of this horrific thing happening to this woman with the serene and peaceful vastness of space.  There's a real beauty to behold in being in one of these missions, so that's a good contrast to the horrifying situation that Stone finds herself in.  The thing about the film is that it works perfectly if you're someone that's looking to be \"entertained\", if you can call it that.  It's a very thrillingly directed film, it's a definite roller-coaster ride.  But if you don't want to think about the symbolism, the film's allegories, and its themes then you can definitely get something out of the film.  But I think the film really hits its strides with its symbolism and its themes of human resilience and evolution, particularly in the last scene of the film.  The last scene of the film, with Stone ***SPOILERS*** finally landing on earth, showcases humanity's evolution in about one minute.  It's so simply done, yet it conveys so many thoughts and debates about humanity and our evolution.  And the image of Stone falling asleep in an embryonic, with a rope near her that looks, unsurprisingly, like an umbilical cord.  Again, very simple but conveys a lot.  There's also religious symbolism and themes explored here but it isn't as focused on as much as the other key themes of the film.  The acting is top-notch.  Sandra Bullock absolutely kills it with her character.  She's expertly written and she's actually one of the better female characters to come out of any film in ages.  She's determined to make it out of this situation.  Granted, there is a moment of weakness where she completely gives up and resigns herself to the fact that she's gonna die, before she has a hallucination of Kowalski coming back and giving her a pep talk about how the fact that her daughter died, before the film's events, doesn't have to define who she is now and what she does with her life from this moment on is what matters.  That gives her like a jolt to fight back and make it back to earth.  It was incredible character development.  From now on, I'm gonna pretend that Sandra Bullock won the Oscar for this film instead of The Blind Side.  And Clooney is as charming and likable as ever.  He adds a calm confidence to the film, at least for the time that he is in the film and I think that helped the film a lot.  Credit goes to Alfonso and Jonas Cuaron for managing to make their very ambitious vision an absolute reality.  The film is outstandingly directed and written, complete credit goes to the Cuarons for their work in bringing every individual aspect of the film together into one coherent whole.  The score to the film is amazing as well, it serves as a substitute for the absolute silence of space.  It creates incredible tension.  As you can see, I absolutely loved this film.  It's really rare to find a film that manages to do everything almost perfectly.  I'm not saying that the film doesn't have flaws, but they're as unnoticeable as any film I've ever seen.  I absolutely loved this film and it easily shoots right to the top of my favorites of 2013.  This is a must-see.",

Watching it with a critical eye made it seem more fanciful than a Tim Burton film.  As a devotee of true space missions and their precision,complexity and adherence to the Law of Universal Gravitation (please note the lack of quotation marks around that last phrase) I am no less than offended by what was perpetrated by this film.  I found myself more moved by the most recent attempts at Muppet fare than I was by this offense to realism.  I'm glad Sandra got her groove back, but this story could have been told without offending the scientists and astronauts that work diligently to perfect the space programs of the civilized nations on this planet.\n\nBy the way... Anyone comparing this film to Arthur C Clarke's fabulous novel \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" , and the subsequent masterpiece on cellulose created by Stanley Kubrick should be launched into space without a pressure suit.  Aside from the fact that these two films are set beyond our atmosphere there are no other correlations between them. None at all. Completion of a mail-in correspondence course in filmography would leave the participant dumbfounded as to why anyone would even consider making such a comparison.  It's simply ponderous.  If Alfonso Cuaron truly wanted the debris and adversities to act as a metaphor for the problems of everyday life then maybe the film should have been named \"Metaphor\".

Without spoiling much, Gravity is a story of two astronauts trying to go home after a space debris storm destroyed their ship. I am not sure if it was the ominous music or the first-person perspectives, but I was totally sucked into the film after the first ten minutes. Cuaron's metaphors are blatant, but still beautifully shot. It's a story of fear, loneliness, desperation, strength, and most of all hope. And it was done with only two actors! Totally love this film. I'm raising my vodka flask for this one.",

Bullock and Clooney are better than ever here and it's probably some of Bullock's best work. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is: you should watch this movie.

Just don't watch it of you have really bad anxiety problems, I wouldn't want you having a heart attack.)\n\nNonetheless, Gravity is a masterfully crafted film.

            "content": "The father and son team of Alfonso and Jon√°s Cuar√≥n have written a gripping, metaphorical human drama in the most dangerous imaginable setting possible in the film Gravity. In terms of dialing up the tension, this film sets a monumental bar in filmmaking and screenwriting. Despite being full of tension and drama, the screenwriters manage to provide us with one of the most powerful contemporary examples of what Blake Snyder calls, the Midpoint moment in a story. In this essay, we will explore this section of the film and winnow out examples of the efficacy Alfonso and Jon√°s Cuar√≥n were able to attain that paid dividends at those precise moments and how those moments built capitol in the later scenes of the film.\n\t\tDr. Ryan Stone, at the midpoint of the film, has lost her only human contact as Matt Kowalksi sacrificed himself to save her. The viewer is forced to reconcile this loss alongside Stone and still keep in mind that she is floating in space and has just gambled to reach the International Space Station. In the most major way, she has just experienced an almost impossible win and simultaneously suffered an incalculable loss. Her small moment of comfort in the ISS is a metaphorical rebirth, complete with fetal position and muffled womb sounds. This respite is short lived as the debris storm is coming back around and the bad guys are truly closing in. \n\t\tThe situation that Stone finds herself in is the epitome of physical danger. As fragile human beings we can feel the tension and experience the fear of death, especially when viewed in the intended 3D aspect. In addition to the physical and logistic mayhem, another real, creeping danger is the tenuous limitations of the human psyche and how ominous isolation can be. \n\t\tIn terms of execution, Alfonso Cuar√≥n stated that the experience of making the movie was not unlike the journey that Ryan Stone goes through in the film. (Cuar√≥n) If this comparison is true, the Midpoint moment for Cuar√≥n in envisioning this film had to be devising ways to portray zero gravity on the screen. The iconic zero gravity moment is when Ryan Stone is ensconced in the ISS floating in fetal position in the WWII fighter/Millennium Falcon porthole with the earth in the background. This isolation and helplessness grabs the viewer and pulls them into the desperation that Stone is no doubt experiencing. \n\t\tThe danger of space madness is fully realized in the coming scenes in the Soyuz. Before her self-imposed stasis within the Soyuz, she is challenged with having to fight a fire in the ISS in zero gravity all while awaiting the continued debris storm. The midpoint of the film offered one of the only moments of respite in the entire film. The transfer from screenplay to screen in terms of timing shows how important previsioning is when dealing with a feature length film. The story on the page reads much more methodically than the experience of watching the film itself. With the visual and sensorial experience, the viewer is tugged along much like Ryan Stone in the wake of Matt Kowalski's jet pack.",

It's like a constant thrill with no unneccessary stuff, still filled with loooong shots.\n\nThe actors does great and especially Clooney impress me. The two leads togheter got some sort of a distant chemistry, still beeing polar opposites with Clooney as the comforter. Some great one-liners especially from him and a great soundtrack by Steven Price.The story is simple and it works out brilliantly, but first of all - this is a visual ride. So many fantastic scenes with stunning imagery, lovely cinematography and great movement, ot sure is one of the most magnificently shot films I've seen. It's simply miraculous - a cinematic landmark. I don't know how they did half of it but I'm guessing there are loads of (well used) animated, digitalized effects. \n\nProbably nowhere nearly as good in 2-D, but it's probably a good watch too. I got some subplot issues and a few tricks and happenings that I don't like but it does not ruin much. It's sentimental and especially that scene where Bullock slowly is floating in the fetal position really gripped me - probably one of my favorite scenes ever.\n\nI guess I would have rated it 8 out of 10 without the 3-D theatre experience, but with the total package this is incredibly beautiful.\n\n9.5 out of 10 Russian Jesuses.",

            "content": "This is a very unusual movie. Unusually BAD. Bedtime for Bonzo has this in spades. It starts with Sandra Bullock, (S.B.), doing a space walk repair. While somebody is playing REALLY LOUD trash music so you can barely hear the commentary. She is a medical engineer. Given a command to go inside, she refuses and has to be ordered. An emergency occurs and she becomes catatonic, then hysterical and remains that way through most of the movie. Everyone is killed except George Clooney, the mission commander, who is calm, confident and knowledgeable in the craft, physics and survival. S.B. has been sent into space after her daughter has hit her head and died. S.B. is obviously suffering from PTSD but sent into space ANYWAY. No screening apparently, no psych tests, nothing. Like Obama choosing ambassadors based on their donations instead of EVER having been to a country, speaking the language or having any knowledge of it. She proceeds to do everything wrong and requires constant babysitting . NO ACTING GOING ON HERE. G.C. helps her until he valiantly dies to save her. She Can't fly the craft, always failed in training, and has no confidence whatsoever. Catastrophe on top of catastrophe she proves her mental instability, from being catatonic to hysterical to suicidal. Apparently in Space everything is a couple of miles apart and easily reachable with little shuttles attached to the shuttle, International Space Station and Chinese Space Station. Time after time she experiences disastrous calamities destroying one station after another. At last in the Chinese station she tries to commit suicide. WHY would an ASTRONAUT consider this, EVER? She has a vision of G.C. who gives her essential information to try to survive, (except he's DEAD). Is this supposed to come from her head? When she clearly has NO practical knowledge or surviver skills? She can't read the Chinese characters and just hits buttons until by luck her module is jettisoned loose and she begins to enter the atmosphere and burn up. Somehow this does not occur and she lands safely landing in the ocean. Her module then begins to sink and she has to swim free. Clue here - she is not attacked by sharks, whales or jellyfish, nor does she apparently land in Somalia. They probably deleted that part because the movie became too long. S.B. was good in The Net. Here she's not a brilliant anything but a mother almost out of touch with reality because of a recent tragedy. Someone who should be institutionalized rather than sent to space. She's nearly non-functional and after the first ten minutes of the movie SHE'S THE ONLY ONE IN IT! This must be a Liberal's idea of an astronaut...don't train, don't learn, don't be the best most competent at your job and know all the other ones too but instead feel sorry for yourself, cry a lot, become hysterical and even suicidal and everything will work out by sheer LUCK. The effects were nice but we've seen those improve from 2001 to Oblivion. G.C. was too perfect which contrasted with S.B. to make her look even worse. Waste of money and time and Bullock is going to make over 70 million dollars from this. I hope they don't give her an award for this because it's running against reliving Slavery Again. The millions in HYPE apparently paid off. Propaganda wins over substance. Guess we'll never see another Casablanca again.",

I put Gravity on the list of entertaining movies, that if the occasion called for it I'd watch again, but could never see myself acually \"wanting\" to watch it again. Which makes it a pretty just okay movie...I guess. The special effects are there, and exceptional. The direction is crisp. Cuaron gives you the feelings of the very big and ominous, then the feelings of claustrophobic insignificance and back again. His shots are beautiful and his use of sound is borderline special, and its key to the film so good thing he got it right. I dont give the same credit to the acting. There's only two actors seen in the whole film so you'd hope they'd be memorable in some way. I dont know why George Clooney is in this movie, he does nothing. His every line sounds like something Clooney would say in real life, was he even in the script? Sandra Bullock got an Oscar nod for her performance and I can't for the life of me figure out why. She's scared in space drifting around....ya ummm...that's it. Oh they did throw in the typical \"she had a daughter that died which has always held her back from her full potential but this one event will allow her to finally let go of the past and overcome\". God its weak and unnecessary. If you enjoy films for character acting and plot then no need. If you do see it for its visual excellence and are anything like me, one viewing will do.",

            "content": "Once in a lifetime comes a movie that is so vastly respected and loved by audiences and critics, that viewing is absolutely essential. That's right, I'm reviewing Gravity. The big one, the one that critics and audiences alike have been gushing over and falling all over themselves with.\r\n\r\nWhat starts off as a routine mission for rookie astronaut Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and the final spacewalk for veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) turns out to be anything but when horrible circumstance after horrible circumstance befall upon the two, causing them to fight for their lives in the sparse, lifeless environment of space.\r\n\r\nWhile some critics call Gravity \"the best film of the year\", I believe it would be more appropriate to refer to this as \"the most overrated film of the year\". Hell, I wouldn't even put it in my ten best films of the year. Call me cynical, call me heartless, call me old-fashioned, compare me to Adolf Hitler, give me all the thumbs down your want, but I just couldn't see anything particularly exceptional or groundbreaking about Gravity that other films did in the past, and better too I may add.\r\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest, when I saw the first trailer, I thought that Cuaron played his trump card too early with Bullock's character floating off at the end of the trailer. I thought, \"how can you make a movie beyond this point if you have basically spoiled the whole movie in a sixty second trailer?\" Of course, I found out watching the movie that there was more to the affair than that, but I still would've constructed the trailer differently.\r\n\r\nOne of my primary problems with the film is that the main character, Ryan Stone, is really not that interesting of a character. Her character is simply as dull as dishwater, and her character development is clich√© and hacky. How is the audience supposed to be invested in a character if we learn next to nothing about her? In order to care about a character, you must set aside time in the film to get to know them, learn their ins and outs. If Ryan was not such a downer, then maybe I would respond to her more. And the fact that (spoilers) her child died is just purely formula to me. It's like they say, \"Oh, you must feel empathy for this character but her daughter died. You must cry for her and root for her even though she hasn't down a single thing to deserve it.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, I never found Sandra Bullock to be that great of an actor. Especially evident in Gravity, all she does is scream, cry, scream, cry, talk to herself, rinse, repeat. I wouldn't even rank it amongst the best performances of the year, because it just seems average to me. Nothing is really particularly special about it that the acting of any average feature has. Neither is George Clooney in this film. He is basically playing George Clooney. Ironic, how when he is finally with a woman his own age, he drifts away from her forever. Yeah, I know, I stole that from the Golden Globes, but yeah, if you must steal, steal from the best.\r\n\r\nI never saw a single Alfonso Cuaron film before Gravity, or maybe I should refer to the film as \"Murphy's Law: The Movie\". How Cuaron and his son Jonas write the film is basically that. They relish at the fact of putting this character through hardship after hardship after hardship after hardship until it truly becomes ridiculous. I mean, nothing can seriously go THAT BAD. I mean, yes, missions can go badly every once in a while and crap can happen to people, but for it to go as bad as it gets in Gravity seems kinda far-fetched to me. Not even Seinfeld episodes had this much bad stuff happen to the protagonists. It seems that the two Cuarons just wrote that in to get your \"emotionally invested\" with a character who is boring and dull even more. It's a win-win scenario!\r\n\r\nCuaron not only participated in the direction, writing and producing in this film, but also the editing with Mark Sanger. There are only 130-some-odd cuts in the whole film, with long tracking shots all throughout. I have nothing against tracking shots in films, and the ones in Gravity actually do work out to their advantage, but I don't like how they are executed most of the time. By the third minute of a non-stop slice of film, I start to get bored. I watch movies to escape reality, to be transported in a world abstract from your own and get totally immersed in it. If I wanted to see a long tracking shot of some gentle images with no story, I do have something called my life. I, myself, also understand the importance of good editing because I am an editor of YouTube videos I make. Editing is an important part of a film, and making the experience even more enjoy in the long run... if done right. The editing is more subtle here, but it still could've served better by having more time in the oven in that department.\r\n\r\nThis next part, I will spoil some key moments of the film. If you do not want to be spoiled, please skip to the next paragraph, or exit the review in disgust over how I am crapping on this \"masterpiece\". Either way works.\r\n\r\nDuring one scene, Dr. Ryan Stone reputedly goes to the International Space Station, and yet there's not a single person there. It doesn't take a nuclear scientist to point out that the International Space Station has people actually living there. Seems kinda hokey, to me, Alfonso. Also, the ending climax, which I was actually laughing at a bit, when her Murphy's Law lands her in the water and she miraculously survives (not even the kid from Life of Pi had to go through shit like this) and even though she does survive, we as the audience are completely unaware if she actually lives, if she actually finds civilization, or food, or shelter. All we know is that she survives the ordeal. At least give me an answer as to whether our boring protagonist actually goes back to listening to the radio on her way home from her job.\r\n\r\nSo far in the review, I have been pretty much trashing on this film. I should probably note that I don't hate this film at all. There's nothing about this movie that is particularly offensive or objectionable. In fact, there's even some stuff I enjoyed in this film. The effects in this film are simply A-1. The entire illusion of being up in space is totally bought due to the impressive effects that will, repeat WILL, win the Academy Award for Visual Effects, even if I could have sworn I saw a couple of wires on those space stations. Also winning the Oscars are Emmanuel Lubezki for their impressive, sweeping cinematography full of beautiful earth images and equally beautiful, but in a different way, space shots. The sound effects work on the film is actually pretty awesome, filled with some pretty unique sounds, or lack thereof in certain scenarios, that will win both sound categories on Sunday. Even though it's not the best of the year, Steven Price's score can turn into a great listen when it's in the right scene.\r\n\r\nGravity is a mixed bag. While I have been spending most of the review pointing out the films faults, and being just spellbound that the film scored 98% and got ten Academy Award nominations from 90 minutes of Sandra Bullock spinning, screaming and surviving against all odds, I am impressed with a lot of the technical aspects on the film. But great visual effects do not make a great film, unfortunately. Strip away the visuals, and you get a less than spectacular film. What made films like Inception or Hugo so good was because instead of focusing on only the effects, but also focus on the characters and the story and the emotion so that the audience can be even more enthralled, and what made films like Avatar or Life of Pi so not good is that they are just lackluster storytelling and clich√© ideas reigned supreme to the point of the audience not even caring about that, and developing the common intelligence of a Transformers film fan. Gravity is not necessarily a bad film, per se, or a film that should not have been made. I am glad that I saw it, and I am glad that I saw another BP winner this year, but either I am the only one not under the drugs or the brainwashing of these \"visual spectacle\" films that I now kinda despise, or I am truly the only one who is letting all these ideas simply go right past my head. If you like this film, or even love it and think it's amongst the best of 2013, then I am happy that you found a lot to like about this film, but to me Gravity is the most overrated film of the year, and one of the overrated films ever made.\r\n\r\n**1/2 out of ****\r\nFINAL VERDICT: 62%",

She is an astronaut for heavens sake! trained, smart, able to handle any situation, make tough choices, think on her feet, and so on. Nope not Sandra, she acted like a complete dope who didn't know a thing about being in space. The \"I have a dead child\" that was inserted into the script at the last moment to pull on your heart strings. Spare me please! She spent 2 seconds mumbling something about tag, a car ride, and that was it. What an emotional scene! (sarcasm) Why were the movie critics raving about this movie?

To be honest when i started watching this movie, i expected it to be either really boring (It's about people floating in space) or over obsessed with special effects as many movies are these days, but i came out of the theater shocked and very pleasantly surprised.

            "content": "Best movie of 2013!  (Don't argue me on this)\n\nGravity in 3D... was... AWESOME!  If there's one movie you see in IMAX 3D, make sure this is the one because this is the kind of film that really immerses its viewers and makes them feel as though they're a part of the action.  And IMAX 3D is a MUST in order to get that full effect.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything about this movie because the only scenes that they've shown in the trailers are things that happen in the first 20 minutes of the film.  Everything else is a surprise.  So this review will be quick.  In short, Gravity is a movie about astronauts who are in space, fixing the Hubble Telescope when a cloud of debris from a destroyed satellite, traveling faster than a bullet, collides with their shuttle, destroying almost everything around them.  So George Clooney and Sandra Bullock are left floating in space with no communication with Earth and seemingly no way of getting home.  And this is where the suspense, anxiety, and bouts of claustrophobia begin (for the viewer).\n\nThis movie has the most realistic effects I have ever seen.  I know I said that in my review about Elysium, but that was a science fiction film with a bunch of elements that don't exist in real life.  This movie has the most REALISTIC visual effects for a movie that's grounded in reality.  Now don't get me wrong, there are some things that happen in this movie that you have to admit are a little far-fetched and likely couldn't happen in real life, but it's the most realistic-looking thing you've ever seen, so you believe that it could and actually is happening, especially in 3D.  And there are many scenes with first-person shots, so you get the feeling that you are the one experiencing everything that's happening on the screen.  Also, there are some shots in this movie that last 10 to 15 minutes straight without any cuts.  It's just the same continuous shot the whole time, even while chaos is ensuing.  Keep that in mind when you see this movie because that alone was pretty impressive. \n\nEven if you don't care much about space movies, I highly encourage you to see this movie anyway for the effect that it'll have on you as a viewer.  This movie was so suspenseful that I caught myself holding my breath at times because I was too anxious about what might happen next that I couldn't even breathe.  This film has something in it for everyone... great effects, a strong sense of realism and believability, great acting, and a good story about desperation, empowerment, and perseverance.  I give \"Gravity\" 4 out of 4 stars, an A+, and a smiley face.  I really thought it was that good.\n\nGO SEE THIS MOVIE!  TRUST ME.\n\nFor more of my reviews, follow me at:\nhttp://cinema-junkie-reviews.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Believe it; Gravity is worthy of the hype that it's accumulated in the past couple months; all the awards go to a movie that is deserving of it. First off, while other movies have attempted space, I guarantee you've never seen anything like this before. Alfonso Cuaron's directing coupled with his beautiful use of cinematography and imagery is reason enough just to go see this movie. It's just absolutely stunning. Every second of every scene, I was completely blown away by the constant reminder of how big the world is and how small we are, as humans, almost to the point of being insignificant. The sunrise; just...wow. Sadly, I didn't see it in cinema but I really wish I had because I imagine, and also based on other reviews I've read, that the use of 3D would have been very welcome; and I hear that people who saw it in IMAX were floored. The use of first person perspective for about 40% of the movie brought a new layer of emotional connection to the main character, Ryan, as we see everything through her eyes and it creates a level of depth that we feel; we feel her heart rushing; we feel her fear, the tension, the emotions; everything. Cuaron's use of sound should also be noted as the sound was astounding. I was lucky enough to be able to watch the movie with surround sound, and let me tell you, I was glued to my seat. Every thump, every explosion, every scene with tense music just complimented every scenario and helped to deeper pull the audience into the experience. I honestly still can't get over how well this movie was directed and it's really one of the most gorgeous movies I've seen in a very long time, so much that I had to literally watch over scenes because I missed the dialogue or I was too distracted by just how gorgeous Earth and space looks. Cuaron's imagination really knows based on his point of view and talent in this movie. But as for music, my favourite parts had to be the periods of silence. In surround sound, I was listening so intently to see if I could pick up anything at all, only after to hear the small thump of a piece of metal, or the beeping of an oxygen tank, or better yet, Ryan's breathing as she's hyperventilating and running out of oxygen. I know I've stressed but gosh, this just harkens back to how well this movie was directed. So directing, music and cinematography aside, the performances were also really great, and make no mistake, despite Clooney's screen time, it's actually Bullock's show. Every second he was on screen, he was charming as always, headstrong and confident which is a reason why I thought it was a nice touch to have his character coupled with Bullock's character who is unsure, emotionally unattached and who seemed to have given up on life. This brings me to Gravity's story; it's not the content that was impressive but how it was presented. The story has been done before; loss of a loved one has lead to depression and giving up on life; but it's the fact that she likes space because its quiet, no one to harass her and its a place she can be alone and not have responsibilities or duties and not be tethered to anything. Suffering a tragic loss, you'd come to expect that of a person, especially considering who it is. But its in the darkest moment of the movie when she finally decides to give up, that portrays one of humanities deepest secrets; we're afraid of being alone and not being remembered. Her character breaks down right before giving up and Bullock just delivers in that performance and it just stuck with me, despite that she was amazing throughout the movie. Her quick growth, because the movie was actually pretty short, which was a good thing because they jam packed so much tense content I feel as if they drew it out, it would have had less impact, was very believable and satisfying. Seeing her decide to fight for her life and saying goodbye to her child (metaphorically) was a really sweet scene and I was happy for her at the end. It's hard to find any complaints for this movie as it's so original and well done but if I had to say one thing, maybe a little more Clooney might not have been a bad thing; so as to show, since he helped motivate her, her willingness to fight again. There is just nothing quite like hearing complete and utter silence and during that, hearing Bullock narrate how much oxygen is left in her tank. The use of Bullock's character alone for most of the movie also helps denote the level of solitude felt in space that went a very long way. I feel like i'm going in circles because there's just so much good to say about this movie; but don't take my word for it; if you haven't already seen it, this is a must watch. Unbelievably gorgeous movie from start to finish, tense and emotionally gripping and thrills never felt in any other movie, Gravity is worthy of all the praise. Seal of definite approval. 9.5/10",

Their emphasis on \"there is no sound in space\" was a poor choice as they decided to add a constant barrage of meaningless noises and humming/singing to fill the fact that \"there is no sound in space\". \n\nThere is too much joking around at the beginning of the movie from George Clooney.  I'm sure they did it to try to make him the fast witted like able funny guy, but it's not appropriate for the situation and is difficult to watch. Especially considering he plays such a marginal role. They make it look like all astronauts do in space is screw around and play games while on space walks. I highly doubt an astronaut would use their tether as a toy to hurl themselves into space and bounce back to the ship.  \n\nFinally, Sandra bullock looks like a skeleton in this movie. It's almost hard to watch a few scenes. \n\nIn summation, I found it difficult to make it through this whole movie, since everyone else seems to think it was the best thing since sliced bread, I stuck with it, I wish I had the last 90 minutes of my life back.

Although the characters in this film aren't the most fleshed out, they're likeable enough, and you wanna see them succeed. The action sequences are very edge of your seat intense. Thankfully the pacing is near impeccable, so after an intense scene, the film gives you just enough time to catch your breath.\n       Alfonso Cuar√É¬≥n has always had an eye, and talent for seamlessly blending scenes together. Although not to the extreme as it was for Children of Men, scenes feel like one massive sequence, instead of chopped up bits. The film is just shot so wonderfully.\n      The acting is great, even if the characters aren't. The characters are probably the only real problem I had with the film. They're good enough, and that's all you really need for this film. However, without giving too much away, there is very much a standout scene between Stone and Kowalski.\n       I mentioned earlier that this film is visually stunning. Everything looks and feels so practical, I'm convinced it was actually shot in space (not really, but damn is it convincing)! To go along with the visuals, is an equally stunning score. Steven Price has composed something truly special. From gritty for the intense sequences, to atmospheric and ambient for the lighter parts, to all out epic beauty for the film's climax. Not a single beat was missed. \n        It may not have a life changing story, and the characters may not be best ever written, but Gravity is much more than those things. With mind blowing special effects, ambitious and innovative filming techniques, riveting action sequences, and an excellent score; Gravity is a monumental achievement in filmmaking.",

However, I still enjoyed fully this  British-American 3D science-fiction thriller and space drama. Directed, co-written, co-produced and co-edited by Alfonso Cuar√≥n, the film stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts involved in the mid-orbit destruction of a space shuttle and their attempt to return to Earth. Despite being set in outer space, the film draws upon motifs from shipwreck and wilderness survival stories about psychological change and resilience in the aftermath of catastrophe. Cuar√≥n uses Stone to illustrate clarity of mind, persistence, training, and improvisation in the face of isolation and the mortal consequences of a relentless Murphy's Law\r\n\r\nOutstanding cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki was matched by Steven Price's musical score, Cuar√≥n's direction, Bullock's performance and Framestore's visual effects. No wonder it grossed over $700 million at the worldwide box-office, emerging as the eighth highest-grossing film of the year. In 2014, Gravity was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Cuar√≥n and Best Actress for Bullock. The film was also awarded six BAFTA Awards, including Outstanding British Film and Best Director, the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and seven Critics Choice Awards. But, I have to mention that I found unusual reaction from Chinese viewers regarding the film... they were not impressed and most of them were upset that \"they again use our Chinese equipment without asking us\" attitude. I had to mention this, because to me as a foreigner in China that was never an issue, and the reaction was unexpected.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay was maybe the only weak point of this movie. The dialogues were mostly acceptable but in moments of crisis they were quite unrealistic, especially when moving forward to find the escape route. Cuar√≥n and his son Jon√°s had those monologues filled with such awkwardly tacked-on backstory that the dialogue-rich scene plays like a parody. Kowalsky loves to tell stories of lost love that he has badgered everyone with time and again, and when Stone's air starts to run low, he contradicts his own instructions for her to conserve her breath and encourages her talk about her own past, which bluntly segues into talk of a lost child. \r\n\r\nOne of the big pluses was that the film has been praised for the realism of its premises and its overall adherence to physical principles, despite a number of inaccuracies and exaggerations. According to NASA Astronaut Michael J. Massimino, who took part in two Hubble Space Telescope  Servicing Missions, \"nothing was out of place, nothing was missing. There was a one-of-a-kind wirecutter we used on one of my spacewalks and sure enough they had that wirecutter in the movie.\" Astronaut Buzz Aldrin called the visual effects \"remarkable\". He adds, \"I was so extravagantly impressed by the portrayal of the reality of zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen-maybe not quite that vigorous-but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet.\"\r\n\r\nI would recommend this to everyone who likes paced story which is fully engaging and thrilling!",

Outstanding visual effects up the ante a few more notches, expertly visualizing the helpless chaos of a rapidly-compounding disaster in low orbit in a way that's both picturesque and graphically terrifying. That the rules and environments are all so foreign and unfamiliar only makes it easier for the viewing audience to forget that so much of what we're seeing is CG. The underlying moral is more than a little blunt, and a few laws might get bent along the way, but to zero in on those is to ignore the focus of the ride itself.

You really their utter helplessness throughout wondering if and hope they will ever return to earth. visions of euphoric events of escaping help give the film variety and emotional weight and the many rollacoaster events, (go and see this film at the O2 on moving seat dbox and it really feels that way) give this film real depth and impact.\n\ni dont give 5 stars lightly but this really is one possibly being the best cinema experience ive ever had. please for the love of god dont wait for home viewing.

The pair is repairing an unoccupied space station when all of the sudden some floating space junk disrupts everything.\n    George Clooney has done the astronaut thing once before in Steven Soderbergh's \"Solaris,\" a slow moving drama that was blasted by critics.  I, however, am part of the minority because I was one of those who didn't dislioke it as much as everyone else.\n     Aiding the pair in their plight is the voice of Ed Harris at mission control.  He also played a similar role as a flight commander of the doomed \"Apollo 13\" mission on the big screen.\n      Cuaron, a director with a distinct visual style. seems to jump from project to project.  His last feature was the dystopian drama \"Children of Men\" headlined by Clive Owen in 2006.  Prior to that he helmed the decent \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azjaban\" in 2004.\n    Gimmick is the key word the movie studio is using to get people into theater seats.  It works to just the right degree in \"Gravity\"\nGrade:  B-  This review was originally published in The Richland Chronicle 10-15-13...\n2/14/14",

The visual effects in this movie are outstanding, in my eyes this years Avatar when it comes to effects. The film follows 2 astronauts completing a shuttle mission when debris strikes them, leaving them tethered to each other all alone in space. The acting in the film is of a very high standard, Sandra Bullock pulling an Oscar nomination for her performance. George Clooney is decent, despite not having too much screen time. The movies script is quite strong for the majority however its not a movie that relies on dialogue. What it does rely on is its special effects and direction. The movie is very well shot, watching it the first 5-10 minutes doesn't change shot at all.This is to the credit of the director Alfonso Cuaron. He has a very visual way of directing which is perfect for a movie set in space. The movie does slow down in the middle of the movie but slowly picks up. For a movie about someone floating round space, it's pretty well done.\nFinal Score\nActing-8.0/10--The performances are pretty solid throughout, especially Bullock\nSpecial Effects-9.5/10--The effects are outstanding in this, should pick up the Oscar for best Visual Effects\nScript-6.5/10--Not much dialogue, but it is a movie where you are supposed to feel isolated\nOverall Score\nGravity-8-- This is a visual masterpiece, Alfonso Cuaron is the star of the show despite Bullocks performance. Should pick up a few awards.",
