She can't remember the terrible events of the previous months, only that she is the only surviving member of her family. Nell wants to start a new life for herself, but just as she begins the difficult process, the evil force that once possessed her returns -- bringing with it unimaginably horrific plans that mean her last exorcism was just the beginning.",

            "content": "\"The Last Exorcism Part II\" continues the story of Nell and the demon who wants her-Abalam. With a new director but the same actress as the first film, Ashley Bell. \"Part II\" is straight up horror story telling in a classic format. There is no documentary style footage present save the internet shot of the footage from the first film so the opportunity to really utilize basic but brilliant gimmicks for shock and thrills are very well in hand for this film. Which I think the director managed to use quite well without being too obvious or any real \"fail\" issue for the most part. The story has Nell moved to New Orleans and on her way to rehabilitation for a new start with new friends. However Abalam is not done with the young girl and there will be no salvation for her in the city.\n\nAs far as the film's ability to bring the scares I have to say that the film did it's job. There were moments that normally would not have been scary nor interesting in the film but because the director utilized the trick of closed in frame shots, in most of the scenes, random moments became thrilling. The story is more focused and open to the viewer with no real hidden plot, which allows for more imagery and dogma that surround the whole possession culture. It allows for a more mystical icon-ism to play a big part in staging the story. It is a true classic horror story in all ways. That normally would seem like a bad thing but thankfully this director knew how to shoot the film and set up the moments that needed to be scary or exaggerated enough to make the movie work. Until the ending of course. That I have issue with. I appreciated the twist that says not every one gets a Hallmark moment but for me it came off cheesy and that boiled down to the use of CGI when more organic FX would have came off better for what the director was going for. \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is a better story and movie than the first film but the first film had a way better ending. There must be a third film in the works because there where some elements of the over all story that were only vaguely highlighted and need to be unveiled in this character's grander story.",

For viewers she is a hook to the film and a reason to invest ourselves so personally in whatever fragmented plot this film tries to assemble. For the most part this film is extremely captivating. It seems more concise than its predecessor and shies away from the found footage angle, although making it less realistic than the original, it makes us more receptive to what the movie is trying to achieve, which is sadly not all that significant. Despite having several tension filled scenes, they don't really lead anywhere due to the film's employment of too many falsities. Flashbacks, dreams, and pre-action jump scares should be used as a foreboding for what is to come, instead of the movie's entire scare factor. The conclusion brought smiles, but such smiles were needed throughout the first hour as well. As far as demonic cinema goes you could probably do much worse, but you could definitely do better.

There's a couple of seriously great visuals. The opening sequence is quite a strong scene and setup (despite this though, it is promptly dropped all together). Ashley Bell in the leas role has proved herself a more than capable character actor, and the effects quality (while not great) has taken a step up since the previous instalment. \n\nAaaaand that's about every nice thing I can bring myself to say. Even before the mentions of salt lines and Croatoan I felt that it played out almost like an episode of Supernatural that's overly long and has intensely boring characters. Beyond links like this it still feels like an episode of a TV show. One that the events of which were initially meant to be crammed into the final five minutes of the penultimate episode for the season, but the show-runners realised that they were going to be an episode short for what they were commissioned to produce so the then had to stretch it out with fuller bullshit to make it into a full episode. Except that it's even worse, 'cause this isn't a twenty, thirty, forty or even fifty minute episode of something, it's a full hour and a half of crap, the previous \"episode\" of which we left behind three years ago.\n\nIt was offensive to devotees of the original (if any besides me exist, if not then at least to me). And it brought nothing off even remote interest to any potential newcomers. I can understand dropping the found footage format of the first film, that way lies Paranormal Activity, and avoiding any similarities with that stream of garbage is always a good plan. But beyond that, all change is bad change, and almost all events of the predecessor are unceremoniously cast aside.\n\nI kept looking at the time while watching this and thinking to myself, \"Wow it's a quarter of the way through and it's still just tension building\", then \"a third of the way through and it's still just tension building?\" then half, then two thirds, then so and so forth until I got to the stage where there was nine minutes left and I realised that it wasn't \"tension\" at all, it was just lazy disjointed events that Botko and Gurland seem to think constitutes an actual film. I am a huge fan of suspense. Huge. But this was not suspense I felt, it was boredom. The payoff for which was a couple of seconds of poorly shot but semi-cool lead up to a potential third film the series doesn't deserve.\n\nSo Part II? It was, truly awful. But it still in no way effects my opinion of the film this is a sequel to. The Last Exorcism, was, and remains a solid and original piece of cinema.\n\n22%\n\n-Gimly",

The found footage style was very fitting in the first and it's still to this day an absolutely terrifying experience. This sequel ditches the found footage style and takes on the conventional format and the results are hollow and disappointing. The atmosphere is sucked away like a vacuum as is character development, aside from Ashley Bell who is on fine form and her character Nell changes, and I like how she is integrated into society but there's no terror here at all. Shop worn shocks are all that this sequel has to offer, it's thoroughly generic. You know what to expect, weird phone-calls, people aren't acting themselves, people stare at Nell, it's all basic and predictable and it leads to boredom. What's worse is that the structure is weak, it's just a string of repetitiveness, everything is so lacklustre except from Ashley Bell who is genuinely a strong actress.",

Let's start with the problems of this movie because there are so many it'll make you very angry if you ever get some minute interest of turning this movie on: Eli Roth, a somewhat well-known horror director (Hostel, Cabin Fever), drops the bomb like he was purposely trying to piss off any horror fan that exists. The opening scene, the BEST and only somewhat good part of the movie, continues on how the first left off with the camcorder.  AND THEN, the entire rest of the movie has zero to do with anything else from the first. It's like using the name of a known film and calling it a sequel (I've seen direct to DVD movies better then this) just to cash out because you want to make a quick buck although this movie made nothing. So, fail. Other then that, the movie is boring, boring, extremely boring, not scary in the slightest but the only part that kept me watching was Ashley Bell's acting and how funny it was to watch a movie trying to be scary!

This film is co-written and directed by Ed Gass-Donnelly, and Ashley Bell is in her old role in this continuation of the events from the 2010 movie with the same name (without part II). Compared to its predecessor, it is not presented in a found footage format, and it is not as appealing to the audience, except the repeated excellent performance of Ashley Bell. The story doesn't help you get involved and most of the time raises more questions than it answers. Somehow, the ending was left open, and until then most of the movie was filled with horror clichés with no motivation to go for real imaginative scares. \r\n\r\nSome parts were on the edge, but most of the time everything was familiar and there are no surprises - this part was not at all as ambitious as its predecetor. Effects were not bad, but, again, I wished for something exciting... and there was nothing at the end.  Just an average horror which is far from what should be associated with the name Exorcism, regarding the quality!",

Part II is the actual last exorcism -- or so I am assuming -- because this sequel is so bad (like rancid, curdled milk bad) that I doubt this story is ever visited again.  It is a shame the makers of this decided to toy with the story and verite style of the original -- which was quite profitable a few years ago because of its micro-budget -- as the original had a few genuine chills and bits of terror as it recounted an exorcism-gone-bad of a young girl named Nell (Ashley Bell) who was possessed by a demonic spirit in rural Louisiana performed by a bumbling preacher in-over-his-head.  This story picks up immediately after the frightening final moments of the first -- it was rather Blair Witch-ish -- as Nell walks away unaware of who she is or what has just happened.  The girl is taken to a home for troubled girls in New Orleans where she hopes to get her life back on track.  A few of the fellow girls befriend her and she starts up a flirtation with a young boy (Spencer Treat Clark) whom she works with at a local motel.  Only ... Nell doesn't get to live peacefully or happily ever after because the demon wants to retake complete possession of her body.  The story becomes one jumbled mess of exorcism-horror-film clichés complete with dive-bombing blackbirds, bodily contortions and voodoo mumbo-jumbo.  The acting here is atrocious and while Bell showed promise in the first film, her talents here are non-existent.  She actually made me want the girl to become possessed ... like faster.  If the film were going for comedy, I'd say this was mildly successful; but its intent is to be deadly serious and if flails.  As if the movie couldn't get much worse, we get the ending ... ugh ... real demonic possession is probably less sufferable.",

            "content": "Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has generously released \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" on Blu-ray and DVD for those smart enough to have avoided it in theaters, but brave (or stupid?) enough to give it a chance at home. I know it's too late for some. Hopefully, my review can still save thousands of others from making the same mistake I did.\n\nEli Roth's \"The Last Exorcism\" was a \"found footage\" movie I really wanted to like. Against my better judgment, I went to see it in the theater and weathered through the first 70 minutes fighting off motion sickness the entire time. I was pleased with it until it unraveled in the last 5 minutes into a disappointing blend of \"The Blair Witch Project\" and \"Rosemary's Baby.\"\n\n\"The Last Exorcism Part II\" picks up with Nell Sweetzer going to live in a girl's home after the tragic events of the first movie. Things seem to be going well as she settles in to her new life by making friends, getting a job, and experiencing her first romantic relationship. Unfortunately, the demon Abalam has followed her to New Orleans and is jealous of her newfound friends and love life. He wants Nell for himself and will stop at nothing to re-take her soul.\n\nHow I thought a follow-up with the ridiculous title \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" would undo any of the damage done by the first film's pedestrian conclusion remains to be seen. It's my own fault for having ANY expectations going into this completely unnecessary sequel. To say there's no reason for this to exist would be foolish, as the box office take proves otherwise. Good or bad, it paid for itself and made enough money to justify its existence financially.\n\nThere are a couple positive aspects I can talk about in regards to \"The Last Exorcism Part II.\" Ashley Bell's performance as demon-oppressed Nell Sweetzer is so captivating and heartfelt that it gives the movie an emotional depth it doesn't deserve. She's been rightfully compared to Sissy Spacek in \"Carrie.\" Bell is destined to shine in much better films in the future.\n\nThe second thing that makes this movie easier to stomach than the first is its lack of shaky-cam cinematography. What you see on screen might be mediocre and dull, but at least your eyes can focus on it. You'll have no need for an airplane barf bag when watching this.\n\nEverything else found in \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is recycled filler at best. We're supposed to believe the demon is in love with Nell. This is displayed in an awkward scene where she is levitated off her bed \"Exorcist\" style and then sexually manhandled by the invisible Abalam. All this is happening right next to her sleeping roommate.\n\nThe physical embodiment of Abalam is laughable at best. Basically, it's a person in regular street clothing and hoodie wearing a mask for a masquerade ball. This is the best idea Co-writer Damien Chazelle and Director / Co-writer Ed Gass-Donnelly could come up with?\n\nAlthough the rest of the movie is nothing to get excited over, the climax and ending of the film is where it completely falls apart. Once again, a horror movie about demon possession finds the \"good guys\" seeking out a solution to the problem through other avenues besides the obvious. It's convenient that in every one of these movies there's never a priest or pastor around who truly has strong enough faith to exorcise the demon from the victim.\n\nThis time, a secret organization known as the Order of the Right Hand who use Haitian voodoo rituals and the conjuring of Baron Samedi is called upon to lure the demon out of Nell's body. Use the powers of a Haitian Voodoo spirit known for disruption, obscenity, debauchery, and his love of tobacco and rum to battle a demon intent on possessing a girl? If it doesn't sound like this strategy makes a lot of sense, it's because it DOESN'T!\n\nExtra features for the DVD release of \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" are more entertaining than the movie itself. A featurette entitled \"Hair Salon Scare\" shows people getting groomed in front of a two-way mirror. The image of a freaky girl resembling Nell appears through the glass and scares the customers. The \"Shooting in New Orleans\" featurette will interest anyone wanting to watch Producer Eli Roth make a fool of himself by admitting he had any part in the making of this dreadful film.\n\n\"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is as senseless story wise as its name. It's a string of redundant horror movie clichés only held together by Ashley Bell's wonderfully plausible and overly qualified acting. Count yourself blessed if you haven't already wasted your time watching this mess. \n\nhttp://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

But things soon take a turn for the worst when demonic return to get her for reasos that are never really explained. \r\n\r\nAshley Bell proves that she has some talent, but the script and direction are so subpar that it's really hard to care about anyone in the film.

So this is about the same girl (Ashley Bell) who escapes the events from the first movie, only to have similar troubles when attempting to start a new life.  I will admit that I'm not a huge fan of 95% of the exorcism movies that I have seen; I'm still of the mindset that once you've seen one, you've pretty much seen them all, and I'm still waiting for a movie that convinces me otherwise.  The first movie was actually halfway decent, at least until they fumble the ball with the ending.  It was mildly interesting, as they attempted to tell the story through the medium of a found-footage film.  This movie drops that concept like a bad habit, and I can't continue this review without at least mentioning what an oxymoron the title of this movie is.  There are really only so many things you can do with an exorcism movie; there are all of those spikes in the score for things that aren't scary (there is a jump scare sequence in this movie involving a mime.  I'm not making this up), and because of it, you never really trust the movie.  Even the sinister things that happen here don't really have any repercussions; side characters remain unfazed by previous events come the next scene, and there aren't really any consequences until you get to the last 15 minutes.  It's not deplorable or anything, it's just everything you've already seen before.  The best thing I can really say is that it is not quite as terrible as The Devil Inside, which is the faintest of faint praise.",

Abandoning the found footage formula, Part II picks up where its predecessor left off, with Ashley Bell's Nell Sweetzer found acting batshit crazy in someone's kitchen. Soon she's in a mental hospital and soon after in a \"girl's home\" where she seems to be pulling it together. Just when things start to be getting better Nell starts seeing cheesy images and receiving not-so-creepy phone calls. Things escalate at a snails pace as we all wonder if these lame scares are the best we're going to get before Nell ultimately attempts to rid herself of the demon with another exorcism.\n\nSimply put, this is a bad, uninteresting movie with bland characters and blander scares. Ashley Bell actually gives a good performance in the main role but there isn't another one to be found in a film without a single other memorable character or moment. Everything is obvious and paint by numbers with a boring and unscary slow build ultimately arriving at an unsatisfying conclusion. Goofy and or stupid moments? Check. There's a sequence where they try to transfer the demon into a sacrificial chicken.\n\nMade because the micro budget original turned a big profit, this is a film with no reason to exist, and it shows. There simply isn't a story worth telling and the execution is lacking enough that what we're left with is a turd that looks and smells like a turd. There have been many better horror options recently (and I suspect there will continue to be) so there's no reason to check this out unless you're a horror completist.\n\n*1/4 out of 5",

Taking place directly after its predecessor, Nell is found by a young couple shaking and in a sort of trance.  When she finally snaps out of it, she's sent to a home for girls that have been treated poorly to get better and return to society as a better person. Soon, mysterious things begin to happen again and it's up to her to find out how to get rid of the demon once and for all. Now, I didn't think that The Last Exorcism was a bad film. It was a decent little found footage horror film that's well worth a rental. The ending was pretty bad, but overall the first was not bad. This sequel, on the other hand, was completely unnecessary. The woman who plays Nell still does a pretty good job, but even she can't save this train wreck. The script is extremely confusing to follow and left me with more questions than answers. The other actors besides Nell weren't that great, especially the guy who plays her love interest, Chris. His lines were beyond forced and painful to listen to. Usually, I can forgive things like this in a horror film IF they're a) enjoyable and/or b) scary. Sadly, The Last Exorcism Part II is neither of these. It tries way too hard with creepy imagery in order for it to be scary, but it just doesn't work and doesn't pay off in the end. There were parts that made me jump, but they were from misplaced jump scares that were just plain annoying. The film isn't enjoyable either because more than an hour is devoted to slow and poorly made character development. It's not fun to watch and will put anyone to sleep. If there was any redeeming quality to this film, it was the ending. I won't spoil it here, but I can tell you that it is pretty neat to watch. However, is it really worth sitting through the entire movie to get through? No, just fast forward to the last fifteen minutes and you'll leave sort of satisfied. In the end, The Last Exorcism Part II is not scary in the least bit with its slow pace and lack of actual tension. Skip this film at all costs. It's not the worst I've seen this year, but it's pretty damn close.",

I really wanted to enjoy this, but I felt that the film relied on recycled ideas to create its terror. The horror itself is never really terrifying, only a bit unnerving and the filmmakers really could have done something truly special here. Unfortunately the movie suffers from a dull script and performance that just aren't interesting. This sequel just fails at delivering genuine chills and you end up wanting more out of the film. As it is, this is yet another clichéd horror film that doesn't cover new ground. With that being said, if they were going to make a sequel to the Last Exorcism, they should have put more effort into it because the original was truly an interesting horror film. The Last Exorcism 2 is just a bland horror movie that doesn't shock the way it's supposed to. The film is predictable and we know when everything will happen. This is a poor attempt at cashing in on the original, and they really should have made something better. The Last Exorcism 2 is just another bad horror movie that has been released this year and one that isn't worth your time. Stick with the original, it is a far superior film than this film, and this follow-up relies on old ideas that we've seen many times before. As a genre film, it simply doesn't deliver anything worthwhile for fans of Exorcism films, and it is a failed attempt at crafting a movie that should have been much better than what it turned out to be.",

The editing was choppy in parts and a few extra scenes could have been used to fill in the gaps. The acting was pretty bad, except for a few of the minor characters. I probably wouldn't even give this movie one star but the ending was worth waiting for.

I get the feeling that someone had an idea for how they wanted the movie to end and then just threw together some low rate actors and pushed it straight for the finish. The plot is disjointed, the characters are not well-developed at all, and the story itself seems to plod along and never really get that scary.

It really did ruin that movie, to the point I severely downgraded the rating I was gonna give it if it had a different and less stupid ending.  So you can understand my skepticism in a sequel to a movie that, even though it had a terrible ending, it was fairly conclusive to me.  And, unsurprisingly, this film isn't that good at all.  If there's one thing that I CAN say about this film is that the ending is considerably better.  Not better to the point it improves the score, but still better.  Another thing is that this film feels different from the first one rather than a rehash.  Unfortunately it also embraces more supernatural aspects and that sort of feels rather generic and tacked on to be honest.  For the most part, other than referencing some of the events of the first film, it pretends that the first flick didn't exist at all.  And it's largely unsuccessful when you rely mostly on what made the first movie fail in the first place.  And the scares are practically nonexistent with none of them really being that good or that effective.  I think the film is concerned with Nell as a character and seeing how she deals with the events of the first film and how she's traumatized and being pressured into 'joining the dark side' so to speak.  At least Ashley Bell is good, she's always been good really.  But her character's development isn't really that interesting.  Dull character development and lack of scares make this an uninteresting and fairly bad film to watch.  Problem is, at least near the end when *SPOILERS* Nell finally joins the 'dark side', there's some potential to do something great, or at the very least something decent, with that and instead of showing you her actions, they just cut away from it and don't show any of it.  And you'd think that in a movie full of terrible attempts at scaring you would give you a little something for your value...but no, they don't.  They take what could've been the best part of the film, as far as horror goes, and they just don't show it.  At least the ending with Nell driving around and causing destruction everywhere as she drives through makes for a really cool visual.  But of course, by this point it is late too salvage this movie, so this cool visual doesn't make up for the ineffectiveness of the rest of the flick.  I just think the movie is put together poorly with Ashley Bell really being the only thing keeping this film from getting a lower rating.  This is a pretty bad movie all things considered.",

The Last Exorcism Part 2 is neither . . . this film goes completely off the spectrum and lands in a separate category on its own, that category is called 'absolutely atrocious'.\n\nThe Last Exorcism Part 2 parts from the interesting aspect of a documentary/found-footage style of filming and we follow Nell and her life after the events of the first film concluded. The first film left many questions unanswered and you would have thought that the film would go out of its way to answer all of those questions, but instead, not only does it not answer these questions, but it leaves you with so many more.\n\nThe film falls so easily into the typical horror movie style of having clichéd jump scares that are so telegraphed and predictable, clearly demented characters who are all part of the demonic cult, dumb people who are oblivious to the weird and evil stuff that happens around them . . . the list continues.\n\nThe film obviously wants us to sympathize with Nell (by the way, the actress deserves a lot better than this movie) and whilst it kind of succeeds in that aspect, you lose any sort of investment in her character due to the lazy script that has forced this laughable script, telegraphed plot lines that you see a mile coming, an ending that will leave you face palming with how rock stupid this movie is and coupled with shocking bad special effects - worse than the ones in Mama - everything about this movie reeks of amateurish movie making.\n\nIf you were going to make a sequel, pick it back up from the end of the first movie and find out what happened to the reverend - all I could keep thinking throughout this movie was 'What happened to the reverend? I want to know what happened to him - because all I kept thinking was that this film did not need to be made.\n\nIt should have been left at the end of the first movie and leave us to fill in the pieces for ourselves and let us come up with our own conclusion. That would have been way better that this excuse of a movie.",

            "content": "Nell (Bell), the possessed girl seen in the first film, is admitted to a New Orleans home for troubled girls. Her life begins to get on track as she makes friends and takes a job as a chambermaid at a local motel. When she visits a parade in the city with her friends, however, Nell begins to have strange experiences, seemingly followed by a group of masked men and street mimes. Telephones begin to ring when they're not plugged in and voices attempt to speak to Nell through radio sets. It seems Nell may not have escaped her traumatic past.\nLast year, for the third installment of the 'Rec' series, the film-makers cast aside the found-footage aesthetic about a half hour into the film. For the sequel to 2010's 'The Last Exorcism', found-footage is discarded completely. It could be taken as a sign that the sub-genre is finally dead, although this Halloween we'll be treated to yet another shaky-cam episode of the 'Paranormal Activity' series. The 2010 film was strangely under-rated, possibly because it had the hated name of Eli Roth attached as producer. With that film, I recall thinking the found-footage format was no more than an unnecessary gimmick as it had a strong enough story to stand on its own. This sequel, however, could badly use a gimmick.\n\nMuch of the film revolves around a litany of tired horror cliches, all of which we've seen employed in far more effective ways in much more successful films. Even the New Orleans setting has become a default fallback for American horror films, thanks to the city's historic relationship with the practice of voodoo. Bell admittedly does her best with a Sissy Spacek type \"sympathetic yet creepy\" performance. Garner, one of America's best young actresses, is wasted in a support role, though it does add to her growing back catalog of movies regarding cults, having appeared in last year's 'Martha Marcy May Marlene' and 'Electrick Children'.\nThe main problem is that the threat to Nell is never really made concrete. A horror film's success often relies on its villain. 'The Last Exorcism Part II' ultimately collapses due to its lack of a clearly identified one.",

Bell is the only redeeming feature to these movies as she does offer a good projection of a messed up small town girl with haunting secrets.  This however is not matched by any sort of work going into a plot, script or support actors.  The film mainly runs some sequences of mundane sightings and body levitations.  This is a particularly short reviews as the film clocks in at ninety minutes(just) and very little happens and then it just closes with a huge anti-climax disappointingly leaving it open to being stretched into more installments.  If the are more to come I would suggest losing the word LAST from the title, maybe change it to next.",

If perhaps this movie had no relation to its predecessor and instead was a separate film all together it may have been better.  Instead, part 2 throws out the documentary style and allows an unoriginal cinematic experience with a script not only bad, but also stupid.  The Last Exorcism returns to the big screen with a needless sequel so pointless, you really will be asking for your money back.

            "content": "The Last Exorcism was a movie that had potential to me until its sad-sack ending completely messed up everything that preceded it. Some liked the idea, I saw it as a huge waste of time and engagement (not to mention investment) I put into the previous hour. Then along comes The Last Exorcism Part 2 (lol title) that didn't excite me in any sense of the word, but had nothing better to watch that week so I hit it with two friends on a Monday night. We were the only three people in the theatre and I knew I was doomed right then. The Last Exorcism Part 2 sucked the big one. The synopsis was a good idea (the 'possessed' survivor trying to get on with her life; for those who care), but the movie's execution went about it entirely wrong from beginning to end. First off, it didn't want to focus on any themes that were brought up from the previous movie or expand on anything past the set-up of this one! The narrative, as a whole, felt completely disjointed in every way and it seemed like the film was just going from one 'scare' scene to the next without any flow behind it. What was the reason behind these satanists again? Who cares because this movie sure didn't. Without any logic as to their actions, the movie wound up making me laugh at the freaks rather than fear them. Speaking of fear; none of that to be found. Absolutely no momentum or suspense what-so-ever, instead opting for 'jump scares' every 5 freakin' minutes! Furthermore, there were ZERO elements of the horror genre to support this one's cause, no scary imagery (fake looking CG), no gore, no sex (unless you count some noises behind a wall), nothing. I can live with it if there's at least some suspense but it lacked on all fronts. And why were half of these side characters in this again? They just random ass disappeared without any follow-up as to why they existed in this. This is the first movie I've seen helmed by Ed Gass-Donnelly and it's not looking very promising. No creative shots, no suspense, no scares. NOTHING. Point and shoot. Bland as hell. Ashley Bell was the only redeeming quality this flick had. She carried an innocence and very believable show when her character was meant to be scared. Excellent performance wasted on a shitty flick. Julia Garner was very sexy and tried her best with an ambiguous performance. Again, great, but wasted. Spencer Treat Clark tried but had crap to work with. Muse Watson showed up in a small but stand-out role as the shrink. Love that guy! Whether you dug on the first flick or not, this is a huge waste of time. Doesn't respect the original and doesn't try to do anything on its own other than suck us dry of our time and money. Forget it.",

The Last Exorcism - Part II is a pretty bland horror sequel.  I enjoyed the first film, almost three years later, I'm still unsure if I'm fond of the ending.  Incase you missed the first go-round, there's quick flashbacks in the beginning but it's better to see the first, Last Exorcism before this for the full effect.  There are a slew of effective scare moments here that might cause you to jump, it seems like that was where the focus was.  There are quite a few lame sequences here, such as the evil men wearing Mardi Gras masks to the walking statue man.  There are some other moments that made me laugh unintentionally as well.  What hurts is that the creepiness factor I enjoyed from the first film is all but gone.  Outside of the jump moments, the story itself is pretty boring and becomes a generic exorcism movie.  The audience isn't clear what's actually going on and what's going on in the girl's head so it can be unnecessarily confusing.  Ashley Bell does a good job with being creeped out as Nell, the young possessed girl.  The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns including Julia Garner as Gwen, Nell's new friend, Spencer Treat Clark as Chris, a young man interested in Nell and Muse Watson as Frank, the head of the girl's home.  After it's eye rolling finish, I hope The Last Exorcism- Part II is the last of the series but chances are, we'll get a last, last, last exorcism.  \n\nWes' Rating: Suck It!\n\nYoutube: youtube.com/Wesida515\nfacebook: facebook.com/Westroopalist\nTwitter: @WesAlist",

This change in direction means that the film becomes another standard exorcism story. The music in the film is a clear 'jump' indicator, becoming predictable and losing a few scares. The film lacks in gore and terror, and seems to lose track of being a horror. \n\nThe ending allows for a possible Part III, not surprisingly as most modern horrors stretch an idea for all its (monies) worth. A genre in which squeals and trilogies has become the rule, not the exception. Part II loses the originality of Part I by opting for a change in filming technique. So this time don't expect so much back breaking yoga: that shock tactic has been done. Instead brace yourself for a quieter and less shaky camera instalment. \n\nAfter all there are only so many times you can watch a girl do 'the crab'......\n\nFull review at www.horrortrunk.com",

I especially loved Ashley Bell, who gives every scene all she's got and is lovingly let loose during the final ten minutes. I loved not always knowing what was real and what was in Nell's head.

It's one of the more ridiculous sequel ideas Hollywood has come up with just to milk what they can out of horror fans like myself and unsurprisingly, the film is no good.  \n\nThe story continues right where the last film ended but this time, they ditched the fake documentary style and made the sequel a regular, old-fashioned narrative film. Ashley Bell, who made her acting debut in part one as a girl possessed (and is known, I guess, for her incredible contorting skills) again plays Nell, who manages to escape the evil cult that held her captive and somehow ends up in a group home in New Orleans where she tries to rebuild her life. But the demon that had possessed her returns with an even more horrific plan which ends up not being very horrific at all. \n\nAs a whole the film is rather dull and the scares are of the \"shadows walking by the camera and standing in the background\" variety. And that's pretty much it. You never get to see any of the actual good gore on screen - it's just implied. Just like the first film, the filmmakers lead the viewer on with teases that don't really pay off and all of the actual \"horror\" happens at the very end but that itself wasn't very good either. \n\nThe only thing that made this film entertaining was Ashley Bell's incredible, intentionally awkward and believable performance. If the film didn't have her in it, there wouldn't be much there at all. I was rather disappointed that they hardly took advantage of Bell's contorting as well. All of the other characters were incredibly bland and the acting was flat at best, which, coupled with my previous complaints doesn't make for much of a film. As I left the theatre all I kept wondering was \"What the hell was Eli Roth thinking?\" Don't waste your time or money.",

            "content": "Though sometimes effectively creepy despite scaring away the found footage premise of its predecessor, the contradictorily titled The Last Exorcism Part II ultimately goes the way of the Blair Witch sequel. It's ludicrously ironic that buzzing flies often pester the actors in this steaming piece of digital. For every legitimate fright swept out of some dark new corners (thrills courtesy of a living statue street performer moving whenever the protagonist turns her head, an in-house massacre shot from an outdoor POV), there's a bevy of oldest spooks in the Book of Shadows (LOUD sound design, jump cuts) that makes this a devil of a dog.\n\nIn the PG-13-rated thriller sequel, newly exorcised Nell Sweetzer (Ashley Bell) tries to build a new life in a New Orleans home for troubled women, only the demon that once possessed her returns with a more horrific plan. \n\nAs possessed backwoods belle Sweetzer, Bell imbues the character with believable levels of both naïveté and ferociousness. Likewise, director Ed Gass-Donnelly works the horror over with some appropriately scary touches. Still, for all of their hard work, the material needs to have the archetypical demonic moments exorcised. Moviegoers have seen possession portrayed on screen numerous times before (The Devil Inside) and seen it done much much better besides (The Exorcist). Losing the faux-documentary style of Part I certainly distances this deuce as far as look and feel, but audiences didn't need to see The Last Exorcism -no classic piece of horror itself - to despise this latest in a long grime of pea soup.\n\nBottom line: Speaking in Bungs.",

            "content": "I finally get to the movies after missing opportunities for two weeks, and what do I get? I get The Last Exorcism Part II, which is a con job beginning with its laughable title. Do none of the producers understand the meaning of the word \"LAST?\" I mean, Christ, Eli Roth's name was on this piece of garbage. How could someone like Eli Roth get behind this swill? This is the guy who made \"Cabin Fever,\" a sex-filled blood bath that sufficed as my guilty pleasure of 2003. Now he comes out with a sexless, bloodless, cliché ridden attempt to get a few jumps out of the less sophisticated movie-goers. That's low. Furthermore, the movie itself is complete and utter trash on every level. For the entire first hour of the film, all the script does is cover up for the fact that it's a sequel. The longest bit of dialogue occurs between our main character, who's name is Nel or something- I never really caught it since everyone always whispers/and or speaks in pro-nouns, and her (friend who's a boy that she likes but he's not her boyfriend since she's like seventeen and she's never had one?). Now, here's what's so ridiculous about their conversation. It lacks even a shred of authenticity. It's all exposition- and it's not even sugar-coated!! So her friend-with-a-dick, Chris, pops out with the fact that he heard she's never had a boyfriend before- because that's a good thing to say to a girl when you want to get in her pants- and then, her response is what got an outright laugh from me. She says, and I quote, \"No, but I think I was pregnant once,\" which is blatant exposition that ties back to the first film, and, incredibly, turns out to be completely irrelevant to the sequel. Apart from that, would anyone in her situation logically say that? NO, that would NEVER happen. This movie is dumber than Lindsay Lohan with a head so far stuck in the clouds, it could make Rick Santorum seem like a rationalist. \n\nThe next problem I have with this filth-on-film is the overwrought, obnoxious Bernard Herman esque score. It doesn't build suspense- it's just annoying, not to mention it contributes to making the film even more predictable than it already is. Oh, the music is getting loud and thumpy so that must mean something bad is going to happen. Idiots! Silence is what builds tensions and elevates fear. Why? Solely because of its unpredictability! I didn't jump once during this movie, because though the producers thought they were staging jumps, they in fact weren't. To stage a jump, one must create an eerie silence, and have that silence last long enough to create a shock when it's suddenly broken. It might not be rocket science, but there is a science to it. \n\nPerhaps I'm so angry with this sour little film because it represents the degradation of horror films as a whole. There's an awful formula that's been established as the number one money-making horror trick the last few years. Step one, abandon all ideas of humor, sex, and take all the violence out to therefore earn a PG-13 rating and widen your audience. Step two, instead of a plot, create 90 minutes of waste, punctuated by two or three jump sequences and a predictable ending. Step 3, release your film, and repeat all three steps at least five times before your awful franchise is truly dead. This is why I was so grateful last year when Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard release the first horror masterpiece in years entitled ironically, \"The Cabin in the Woods.\" They poked fun at the genre while simultaneously transcending it. That in itself is brilliant, not to mention their film overflows with downright hilarity, gallons of blood, creatures from all walks of horror, and two perfectly-timed, ironically introduced Anna Hutchinson boobs. It was a truly perfect horror film. So there ya have it. Instead of paying nine dollars to see this piece of excrement on the big screen, stay in and rent \"The Cabin in the Woods.\" Cameron out.",

            "content": "The Last Exorcism Part II is one of 2013's best Horror films. I just came home from SM Lipa today and I was so amazed when I watched this film and I never saw the first movie but I'm so interested to watch the first one since I bought it already after watching this film. Now the plot of this film takes place after the events of the first movie where Nell Sweetzer is found terrified alone in rural Louisiana. She gets to stay in New Orleans in some orphanage for girls but soon she discovers that the demon that was in her once is now coming back again and this time the demon has more plans to use her again. To be honest I love this movie and its not really a bad film at all. Its a surprising Horror film that has a lot of impressive ideas and genuine scares with an enormous amount of atmosphere thanks to a brilliant and well paced script and some stylish directing from director Ed Gass Donnelly. I totally love this movie and I have no problems with watching it at all the whole movie just gave me a big wow in the head. What's great about The Last Exorcism Part II is that the whole movie has a lot of genuine and surprising scares from start to finish. There are so many good jump scares within the whole movie. The opening scene was tense, thrilling and super scary at the same time. Scenes from the orphanage where Nell is haunted repeatedly is one of the most intense parts of the film and I love how the atmosphere was well used in that scene which makes it even scarier and scenes like the church scene is one of the creepiest moments in the whole movie and the finale of the film is one of the best and scariest endings in Horror history. I also enjoy a couple of scenes like Chris' death which is probably one of the most unexpected kills in the movie and even though most of the kills are not gory at least I enjoyed the suspense used in every kill scene in the film and every scene in the film just creeped me out a lot and some also made me jump which I totally enjoyed in the movie. One of the other good things about The Last Exorcism Part II is that the whole film has an enormous amount of atmosphere. There are lots of scenes where the lighting is well used and I just adore the ideas of the atmosphere in the whole film and overall this movie has delivered some of the best ideas ever. And the last things that I like about this movie is that the whole film changed its style because I heard the first film is done in a found footage style while this one remained as an ordinary Horror film instead of continuing the found footage technique that's now used in most Horror movies now a days and I was amazed overall with the film's style and technique. Ok I quite admit that the CGI in here is quite well used and there are some parts where the CGI is quite well used and some that are just bad but not horrid but I was ok with certain parts of the film overall. Now the acting is great all of the casts did a really good job with their work in the film so far and the actress who played Nell did a wonderful job with her work in the film and she's very pretty in certain parts of the film while the rest of the casts did a good job with their work in the movie overall. Director Ed Gass Donnelly did a very good job with his work on the film so far and I like how he worked on this movie a lot and I can't wait to see what's his next film. Overall The Last Exorcism Part II is a solid Horror sequel that delivers the goodies and suspense of most exorcism Horror movies and this is definitely one of 2013's most suspenceful Horror films ever made and I would give this movie a 10/10.",

She's placed in a group home and attempts to return her life to some sort of normalcy. Obviously, we can assume this won't happen lightly, if at all. Along with Bell's impressive performance, including a vulnerability and naivety that could easily have been overdone by any other young actress, the scares help keep this film afloat, building tense moments with ease, starting from scene one in a stranger's bed. Made even more creepy by being placed on the streets of New Orleans, not only does \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" delve further than I possibly could have imaged, it actually does so in a somewhat refreshing and unique way. Had the ending been stronger and less of a throwaway, this could have been an above average film. Instead, it rises from its preconceptions and gains at least some sort of respectable stature.",

            "content": "Maybe I'm nuts for enjoying this, rather suspenseful, horror sequel, but I thought it was pretty good. Sure it rips off tired horror movie stunts like people disappearing when a car drives past or telephones still ringing once they're unplugged or a flock of birds flying into a house (combined with Dark Skies, this is a bad year to be a bird), but there's enough suspense created by director Ed Gass-Donnelly to satisfy most moviegoers. Due to his expert pacing and bold choice to go for tension over big scares, the director is able to create a tense thriller that actually frightens you more than it does shocks you.\n\nBell's performance might be considered a little over the top for some, but it worked really well for me. As she did in the first film, Bell portrays a young woman who is innocent enough, and has been brainwashed enough to buy into the existence of demons. Her performance in the more character-driven moments is what worked for me. We care about Nell, so when terrifying things begin to happen to her, we have an interest in what happens to her.\n\nSome of the downsides to the film occur in its adherence to the tropes of the genre. Most of the scares, meant to make you jump, don't work, because we can see them coming from a mile away. In defense of the film, although, I don't feel like this is where the film gets its creepy effect, but the director, or perhaps the studio, felt it necessary to throw these moments in there. Also, several members of the supporting cast feel stiff and pretty unbelievable, specifically Nell's roommate who has a second act change of personality that doesn't make any sense. And without spoiling anything, the ending is pretty ridiculous, and is just more evidence of the film's failure due to adherence to genre standards.\n\nPart II overcomes its flaws though by introducing a new element to the film towards the end of the second act. This element brings new and interesting characters into the mix that change up the pace, and allow Part II to feel coherent with the previous installment, which up to this point, due to style and mood, felt pretty different. The choice to get away from the found footage genre, that the first installment in the franchise was a part, was a brilliant choice. It allowed the film to feel like it had a purpose, and not have to be tied down to the constraints of having to be shot by one of the characters.\n\nIt's definitely not anything groundbreaking and there are valid complaints about the film, but The Last Exorcism Part II is a creepy and moody horror film that works on many levels.\n\nFor more movie reviews visit: www.reelfive.com",

            "content": "I re-watched 2010's The Last Exorcism just the other day as I planned on seeing the sequel this week. I remembered liking it much more than I expected but not for the reasons one expects when going to see a horror flick. No, I was never truly scared by what I saw on screen with the original film but more I was intrigued by the originality of it. Just when I thought I'd seen every kind of incarnation in which an exorcism could be presented on screen this found footage, documentary-like movie set a new standard for the exorcism film. The heart of that film, despite Ashley Bell's wonderfully innocent performance as sheltered yet possessed farm girl Nell Sweetzer, was Patrick Fabian as Reverand Cotton Marcus. Fabian created a charismatic character that was difficult to like, but at the same time able to create a sympathetic reasoning for his actions. He was a con man toying with peoples beliefs, but he was funny and to be fair he always had the best of intentions. The first film that needed no sequel, that called for no continuation of the story, or left anyone with a desire to see what happened to Nell (I think we all just assumed she died giving birth to a demon child!) was a brief hour and twenty-seven minutes long. The Last Exorcism Part II (which may be the most misleading title in the history of cinema) clocks in at only a minute longer, but feels like it goes on for days. It has an episodic feel to it that never picks up and never feels like a coherent work but instead a compilation of scenes that show our protagonist running from something, who we're never given a real reason as to why, and are expected to be frightened every time a loud sound interrupts the scene over and over again.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

The Last Exorcism was one that worked pretty well as it made sense to the story and the overall film was executed pretty well, despite the lame ending. To no one's surprise the success of that film spawned a sequel that intelligently decided to move away from the found footage style and make it a normal movie that looks to be pretty cool, despite it's somewhat silly name. \n\nThe Last Exorcism II follows Nell as she tries to build a new life after escaping the events of the original film, but when things seem to be going well the evil that once possessed her returns to take back its host. Much like the Blair Witch Project, Exorcism decided to go this other route with its sequel, but unlike it tried to keep the story intact. The story is perfect for the direction to keep this story moving, but sadly the film doesn't offer all that much. If not for Ashley Bell, reprising her role, this film would have fallen apart fast. She is so great in this role delivering all the emotional torment and innocence needed to make this character work. Beyond here there is really little going on in this movie other than her wandering around Louisiana. We all know that the formula of the possession films is the slow build, but when we already have an established story and character there is no need for it to be this slow. The few moments of \"haunting\" that you do get work well enough, but nothing like the powerful imagery of the first film that made it stand out so much. \n\nThis is one of those sequels that wasn't needed but welcomed in hopes to make up for what they did with the silly ending of its predecessor. Make no mistake this isn't a horrible movie, it is actually still pretty entertaining on some levels, just doesn't push the limits like it should have. The ending proved to be a bit of an interesting direction to continue the series, but was just a bit too little too late to pack the punch it needed. \n\nhttp://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",

            "content": "Directed by, Ed Gass-Donnelly, \"The Last Exorcism Part II,\" is the sequel to the fairly successful \"The Last Exorcism.\"  Unfortunately, unlike the first, the second is disappointing. So much so that even the most forgiving of horror fans will find it hard to really enjoy this poorly made film. \n\tThe movie picks up immediately following the first \"Last Exorcism,\" and to add to the confusion of having two last exorcisms, viewers will be expected to assume that somehow main character, Nell, played by Ashley Bell, survived the first. The movie begins with her entering a house down the road from where the movie left off; from there she is taken into a hospital in New Orleans. Then, Nell is taken to an all-female safe house.\n\tThe rest of the movie revolves around Nell trying to escape the demon that has come from back for her. And as exciting as one would think a demon chasing after someone would be; the movie is mediocrely tedious.  \n\tScene after scene is filled with flashbacks to the first movie, as well as random still shots of objects. The film also offers many, many random character entries that offer little depth and add absolutely nothing to the movie other than confusion. The main examples of these random entries are with Nell's new love interest, Chris, played by Spencer Treat Clark, and the entrance of psychic, Cecile, played by Tarra Riggs. In both cases, the characters seem unbelievably involved in Nell's life within a matter of seconds after meeting each other.\n\tThen to top this issue off, the acting within the movie comes with so many failures, both Tarra Riggs and Spencer Treat Clark's characters seem fake and pushed. This creates huge setbacks in the movie that make the film so unbelievable because both character's emotions are hardly passable as real.\n\tPerhaps one of the only good things about \"The Last Exorcism Part II\" is Ashley Bell. Where there are so many failures in the acting, she is a gem. Unlike the others everything she does sounds and feels real. Bell is convincingly crazy and plays the role of a possessed psycho almost too well.\n\tLastly, one other entertaining factor within the movie is the buildup of suspense.  The film offers many suspenseful moments, and while this is entertaining to follow, viewers will be disappointed as each scene ends with emptiness and poor excuses for scares. In fact, the movie's scariest moments are actually within the flashbacks to the first \"Last Exorcism.\"\n\tIn all actuality, \"The Last Exorcism Part II,\" could probably have passed as an average to mediocre horror film, but once the final scene begins, all hope for the movie is lost with an extremely inauthentic and cheesy ending filled with special effects of random props lighting on fire. The movie will most definitely let even the genre's biggest fans down. It is a snooze fest filled with disappointing suspense, poor acting, and cheap effects;  all built off of still shot scenes of random objects and flashbacks.\n\nhttp://rileysopinion.blogspot.com/",

The trailer is as good as it gets! As much as I love Ashley Bell and think she is an incredible actress, the movie was awful, predictable and the finale was 10 minutes on a table with nothing happening. No bending in obscene angels like advertised on the poster never happens. I'm really disappointed with Eli Roth, normally I love his movies! (Hostel, Hostel 2, Cabin Fever) and looking forward to his new movie coming out called \"Aftershock\". I can say if it wasn't for Ashley Bell's acting the movie would be a total write off, but not even she can save a terrible movie! I have to finish by saying Nell is no Carrie....LOL Leave the random fires to her when she's on a rampage! LOL If they do make a Part 3 I can guarantee you in will go straight to DVD, I don't think this movie is going to do well at the box office :-(",

Near the end where I was waiting for the actual encounter with the Demond I was sadly let down with a few more jump scares and more of there crappy cgi I just can't stand cheep cop outs like this so no do not see this plz save an hour of your life and see something good this is not worth it AT ALL !!!!!!!",

            "content": "Another Modern Day Classic\nBy: Dennis Campbell\n\nThrough the slew of terrible movies in this early season a beacon of light has appeared. It is not an overblown drama, nor was it a depressing love story; although the ending is by far one of the saddest I have seen in quite some time. Forgive me for being vague however I feel this movie deserves all the credit that can be mustered out of a small review. For not only has it saved what is usually the worse quarter of the year in terms of movies, it has also given new life to a genre which has been on life support since Freddy Kruger stopped murdering people in their sleep. The film in question is The Last Exorcism Part II. The film picks up shortly after the first one ends, there is a pan over the woods which Nell was dragged through and tortured in. On the ground is the video camera used in the first film, seeing it lie alone without an owner starts a steady buildup of Hitchcock like frights that culminate in a terrifying sequence that not even Wes Craven could have imagined. From the woods we are taken to a small house where a couple is laying in bed, the woman gets up to use the restroom, and taking her place is Nell. Ashley Bell, the actress who practically made The Last Exorcism returns in a demonic state. After attacking the male she scurries beside a refrigerator, and as the camera focuses in on her red eyes we know that Abalam has returned.  \n\nFrom there Nell goes to be evaluated by a list of doctors, and just like any good horror film there is a moment of peace. The clouds part and sunlight shines down upon the life of Nell. Whatever happened to her in the woods was only a fantasy, and although she does not know what lies ahead in her heart she knows it will be good. She meets a boy named Chris (Spencer Treat Clark), and they begin somewhat of a romance together. And for about thirty minuets of the movie all is well, that is until the phone rings. \n\nNell answers a phone call and hears the sound of a baby crying on the other end. This however is just the beginning, from there visions of her late father begin to haunt her, pleading with her to resist evil. At every turn Nell's innocence is in danger and she becomes what so many characters in horror films are not, she becomes relatable. Her soft presence and insecurity tugs at the hearts of the viewers and it aches every time she is in pain. A fabulous example of how she wins the hearts of the audience over is very early on in the film when she utters the line,\n\n\"Nice boots.\"\n\nOf course you will have to see the first part to understand the significance of this line. But it captures so much emotion that it becomes a signature line in the movie. Then of course her friends begin to turn on her, or at least she believes so. The brilliance of the first part of this series is not so much the acting involved, but how open the storyline is to the possibility the Nell is simply schizophrenic. Although this idea is partially discredited early on in the film, the question of that never leaves until the very end. If anything makes this movie worth watching it is the ever present uncertainty of whether we are watching a possessed woman, or just a schizophrenic.   \n\nBut it is not just Ashley Bell who performs well in this movie; there is the flawless acting performance of Spencer Treat Clark. His childish image is a great match for Nell's insecurity, there is a scene where the two are at a zoo and Nell asks why he likes her so much. Although Chris has no real reason, the connection is clearly there. The only thing sadder than the ending is seeing the boy we have come to like commit suicide. And even worse perhaps, he was possessed by Abalam. Shortly after his death the phone rings again, and it is Chris on the other line.\n\nIn one act of defiance and strength Nell swears vengeance upon Abalam, and so beings the heartbreaking ending.\n\nLocked inside an enchanted room Nell is being prepared for yet another exorcism, and as it begins Abalam appears before her, unseen to the other four participants. As Nell screams in agony Abalam inches closer, he is wearing a mask. As the air is sucked out of the theater he reveals who he truly is, Abalam is not a he, but Nell herself. It is revealed that it is her destiny to become Abalam, to rule over the world and bring forth the End Times. As this revelation is made between the two Nell's, the Priest conducting the exorcism injects Nell with a deadly dosage of morphine. While her strength fades, she is presented with a choice. Take Abalam's hand and accept who she truly is, or die without fulfilling her destiny. \n\nJust before she can make a decision her heart monitor goes flat and she dies, but some of her subconscious still lingers behind those eyes of hers. While the remainder of the group cries Nell jolts up, and takes Abalam's hand.   \n\nAfter murdering those who tried to save her, Nell returns to her boarding house and faces her guardian. \n\n\"Nell?\" He asks \n\nShe shakes her head no. \n\nThen, in a flash his body is bashed against the door and the house is set on fire. One of the last images that we see of Nell is her wearing the boots she spoke of early on in the film. It is then we know the transformation is complete; there remains nothing of Nell the sweet girl who cherished all things. All that remains is Abalam, and as the film ends he drives down the street setting everything ablaze. \n\nWhile the film may not be as well thought out as the first one, The Last Exorcism Part II is every bit as terrifying and bone chilling. Although this film may not receive the best reviews I urge all those who read this to go in with an open mind. And once the credits roll make up your own mind, and say a prayer for Nell.",

Regardless , the movie does enough in its opening minutes to lead you into the sequel. If only anything mattered...\n\nIf the fact that that the title is The Last Exorcism : Part 2 didn't tip you off that the movie is probably a cash-grab and most likely a terrible film I'll briefly explain why this film is pure trash. Nell has apparently developed amnesia of the events of the first film but nevertheless is trying to live a normal life again. We meet some new characters , we see \"spooky\" stuff for an hour with heaps of people dying off camera or having seizures , we have an exorcism , and roll credits.\n\nThe rest of this review applies to every other exorcism movie out there so accurately I may just copy and paste it into future reviews. The Exorcist was an absolutely harrowing film because it was grounded in reality and boasted effects for its time that have stayed with people even to this day. To this day it also has phenomenal writing and directing. You cannot tell a compelling exorcism tale through shock value , jump scares, terrible acting, horrific dialogue , and half-assed scenarios conjured up on a toilet and put to a piece of paper. To anyone attempting to make an exorcism movie ; please watch The Exorcist and understand why it's regarded as the greatest horror film of all time.\n\nIf these movies continue to get made, all I ask is that we get one that is decent. I'm not going into these movies expecting for a classic to be shattered but how I approach every movie. I want to be entertained based on the merits of the film. It is absolutely pathetic that a comedy as terrible as Marlon Wayans' A Haunted House is somehow a respectable parody of the garbage that is The Last Exorcism: Part 2.",

Although all the other actors/actresses are just mediocre and have nothing but motto toned looks and stupid dialogue. This movie has some scares but also to many jump scares. The movie is not a suspence builder like the first one was instead it is a face paced jump scare movie. There are some freaky parts that have suspence here and there but as a overall you feel let down and don't know when it is going to end.

While the film takes place in New Orleans they take a good shot at using the environment to the story. The ending did disappoint me a bit. I thought that it would be an epic confrontation. It wasn't but it wad pretty cool. I thought that the acting really shined especially from ashelu bell who looks like Judy Garlend.\n\nTo sum this up it has small scares, great performances, weak middle, strong beggining and end. Yet unoriginal and sort of predictable. Still better then \"Mama.\" Which made me happy. I'm giving this movie a decent review because it was a bit better then my original expectation.\n\nSCORE: 6 out of 10\nCBS films, Rated PG-13, 88 min.",

The directing in this was pretty solid and not a bad job. I liked how the director worked with the camera and where he positioned it and how he captured all the things around. And Ashley Bell. She wasn't bad. She was the only decently acted part in this whole movie. She tried her best and ill giver he props for it. Now, everything else in this pile of crap is AWFUL. Everything. The other actors in this are pure crap. They all suck. The script in this is beyond stupid and dumb and doesn't make an ounce of sense. The \"visuals and CGI\" in here was so fake and poorly done. And not one thing in this is scary. its so unscary its laughable. And the ending. Dear god was that awful. I won't spoil anything but just know that it is as worse as the ending from The Devil Inside. It is that shitty. The Last Exorcism Part 2 is beyond stupid, awful, unscary, dumb, shitty, corny and just plain bad. The acting sucks except for Ashley Bell and everything else is just plain terrible.

But this film loses almost complete track of what made the first film interesting and clever, and this ends up being nothing but crap.  The beginning of every year is filled with a bunch of crappy horror films that nobody wants to see, and that is precisely why they put it at the start of the year.  There is a small piece of footage from the original film in this movie, and I promise you that is going to be the scariest part of this film.  I mean I can't remember seeing a horror film that was actually as non-scary as this one.  I was never frightened, or shaking, or even closing my eyes, I just sat there and looked at the time to see when I could leave.  It's hard to fully explain how unoriginal and predictable a film like this is, and if you watch the end of the film you know they are preparing another sequel and this scares me.  I don't want to pay more of my money to see another bad and uninteresting sequel with no reason to exist, because this film has already accomplished that.  Ashley Bell is probably one of the most awkward and uninteresting actresses of her generation, and I sincerely hope she doesn't continue her career in the horror genre.  If you are looking to spend money on a scary time, I suggest you turn around and run away as fast as you can.\n\n  The story follows Nell (Ashley Bell) as she is returned to a normal life after the events of the first movie, away from her brother and father. But she is brought back into her old life when supernatural things start occurring around her and her friends.\n\n  The plot is so pointless, predictable, boring, deficient, nonsensical, laughable, and overall just plain bad that I hate having to write a review for it.  I didn't care about any of the characters, and most of them spend time just being clichés that I could've cared less what happened to them.  This is a concept that hundreds of horror films have done before, but the producers must believe because it's a sequel to a moderate box-office success that somehow it will make for good filmmaking, but they were wrong.  But I think what made me mostly angry about this ludicrous story is the same problems most horror movies have, and that is the fact that it's just not scary.  When I pay my money to be scared, I expect the movie to actually be slightly scary, but sadly this film depends all on cheap and pathetic jump scares that wouldn't scare a 2-year old.  Some people believe that I give horror films a hard time because I am not a fan of horror films, but on the contrary I love horror films but only if I feel that I have been scared.  I enjoy old school horror films such as \"The Shining\" or \"The Exorcist,\" and sadly I haven't seen a horror film in years that could even come close to classics like those films.  This film feels like it wants to become some big franchise like \"Saw\" or \"Paranormal Activity\" but if you ask me it couldn't survive becoming a series.  Characters that are boring and one-dimensional, a story that completely depends on the original film, and a concept that has been used many times before by many better films.  I hated the script, and I think the money grubbing filmmakers could've cared less. \n\n  The cast mainly consists of Bell's boring and talentless performance, and it disappoints me because she actually gave the original film a spark of hope.  Ashley Bell gave a mysterious, dangerous, and even creepy performance in this films predecessor, but that was mainly because she was a supporting character.  Now the writers decided it would be smart to make her the star of the film and carry the weight of the entire cast, which might've been the dumbest move I have seen in a long time.  She just seems sick the entire film, and I realize this is the point of her character, but it just doesn't work with my taste.  She just sees a lot of danger but she rarely is actually under any danger, and I think we see her yell and scream more than just talking.  She hasn't become a popular actress or even well known, and so I don't know why they believed it would be smart to make her star in this film.  There is a small number of supporting actors in the film that I will not even bother mentioning, because my guess is that this is the highest any of their careers are going to get.  Overall Bell's awkward and senseless performance can't carry any of the weight of the films witless story.\n\n  The Last Exorcism: Part II bored me to death and destroyed any chance of this becoming a franchise.  Director Ed Gass-Donnelly had high hopes when I saw his film \"Small Town Murder Songs\" which was a well-directed and written film, but now I believe he has shattered the progress he made with that previous film and has given us a sloppy and laughable horror flick.  He gives this horror film no soul or edge to make us actually care about what is going on, and it feels like they made this as quickly as possible so he could just take his money and go home.  This film reminds of when I was told they were making a sequel to \"The Human Centipede,\" a film that some people enjoyed and some people just couldn't swallow.  Some people were very disappointed also with \"The Last Exorcism\" so why on earth would they decide to make sequels for these two films?  Sometimes I wonder what could be going on in a filmmakers head, and I just miss the days when horror films actually used to be fun and scary.  This film tries nothing new and has nothing to show us other than a few flashy jump scares that, as I said before, couldn't scare a baby.  I think most people will have a good sense and realize what a piece of trash this is, and I hope most people will have some common sense and just stay home and save their money for a better film.",

I expected this to be like a 80-minute, straight-to-Dvd, poorly directed, crappy camerawork piece of undeniable filth, It was alot better than that still resembles it. One of the main things that surprised me about the film was how great the camerawork was. This surprisingly had some great shots. (not another found footage film) The plot was also very nicely put-together. Things I really hated about it: The script was horrible; there is this one scene (boy and girl date scene) where screenwriting could have been written better by my 9 year old sister. Another thing I really hated were the scares, It relied on Jump Scares. Not only did they go on for like 20 seconds; but it happens consistently throughout and right behind each other. Some of them are sadly displayed and Some are just like.....really? The scares aren't too impressive because it's in the beginning of the film and so instead of you sitting there for 45 mins bored as hell and you begging for some stuff for happen, they throw in some shitty jump scares and there's where your ten dollars went. One of my biggest thing with this film: The Ending. It's another shitty ending and as you can kinda examine from the title; It doesn't end here. The Ending was done so awkwardly and just out-of-place, It could have been SO MUCH BETTER. It lefted you in just this awkward feel like.....ahh...Ok..cool. Overall, Better than the first, but not much better. This could be a decently well trilogy if the third one gets good.",

            "content": "Unlike so many others (general audience not critics) I count my self a fan of the original Last Exorcism. I found the film to be throughly engaging. Funny with some creepiness and a burst of disturbing at its unexpected if slightly hammy conclusion. The no. 1 thing I loved about that film was Cotton the Reverend, the second thing Nell played by Ashley Bell in a physically daunting, creepfest performance. So when I heard they were developing a sequel I was game Because the first film had created characters that I liked. But as the release loomed closer I realized that Cotton wasn't going to be part of the mix which was a little bit of a let down. However even though the trailer looked a little silly, well a lot I wanted to give the film makers props for not going with the know annoying found footage routine and updating out main characters story to something more classically cinematic. The results are mixed but it's safe to say that there's enough to merit a soft recommendation. The film picks up the moments after the events of the original where Nell is found traumatized and brought into a girl's halfway house. Everything seems well enough at first as she begins to adjust to everyday activities. It's a little lifetimeish as she listens to her first ipod, wears some lipstick and has her first real kiss but we like the character and Bell keeps it engaging. But strange things begin to happen and we slowly but surely discovering that the demon from the original is still looking for her to fulfill a prophecy of horrific proportions. It all sounds a little generic but the way in which the material is approached is somewhat interesting because you see the demon has in fact fallen in love with her and is sort of courting her destroying the life around her. It's a n intriguing concept sadly not fully explored but hidden inside this is great one and had they had more a budget to hide this hokey effects (cartoon cgi fire ugh), A more in depth screenplay and a harder rating which would have allowed them to show more this could have been a real blast. There is potential that runs throughout the film populated by solid performances especially for the genre, some decent scares, a creepy indie atmosphere and some really nice cinematography (the shadow work is impressive). But in the end it fails to really deliver on any of its promises which is sad and with its dismal box office and a feisty finale which could have led to something pretty cool it doesn't look like we are going to see another entry. Maybe we'll get lucky and they will explore the concept further on a direct to DVD sequel. But regardless of the films faults of which there are many it's a lot better than most of the big studio crap they've been releasing like The Possession and The Apparition at least there's a story here an an intriguing one at that. 3/5",
