This movie had me ROFL since the very beginning. The original Hunger Games movie was understandably too serious at certain parts of the film, such as \"I Volunteer as Tribute scene\". While watching this scene and others all I could think of \"wouldn't it be funny if this and this happened\". I'd share these thoughts with my friends and we would have a good laugh at the movie theater. What's interesting is some of the spoof movie ideas my friends and I had were portrayed in this movie, such as - what if two tributes were to enter a sexual intercourse in the Arena? Forget the life & death/ survival tools from sponsors such as spile or sleeping syrup. What if some sponsor were to send them condoms?? To have their romance take a completely different turn on live television. In a real world that's how it would happen. And such scene actually occurs in the Starving Games between the Katnis and Peeta parody characters. Hilarious. Watch this movie, on a bad day or if you really want a good laugh. 3/10 rating for this film is highly inaccurate and individuals that gave this review have no understanding of what spoof comedy is.",

            "content": "Hello! This Goofy Ahh Review was written by Lilratshat. I was forced to write this by berny sanders spy drones. It took 69 hours, so please don't IP ban me. Without further ado I present Lilratshats Starving games Review! (Pls Unban Sophia Mcshitty K thx)\n\n\n\n\nThe starving games are by far the worst movie I have EVER seen. Anyone who participated in this should really be ashamed. The starving games could be compared to a boiling steaming rotten runny pile of fresh shart. It's so bad, that I want to give myself 69 swirlies in a gas station bathroom and pretend I'm constipated by screaming my head off, so the whole neighborhood can hear my howls of pain after watching this movie. It was so bad, that I regret spending 91 minutes of my life watching this completely disgusting film. Really, what were the directors thinking\u2026 \n\nOn the other hand, people who have watched or read the Hunger Games Movies and books may want to see more. The starving games are a remake of the original Hunger Games, but they are way better. It is like the original movie, but it has more humor and delightful moments, making it quite interesting over the old depressing hunger games. \"I didn't get picked, I didn't get picked, No more Starving Games for me!!!\". This movie is truly one of the best I have ever seen, and I recommend it for all ages.\nThe starving games is a movie about 24 kids who compete in the starving games for a great reward. The fight takes place in an arena, and the children are given weapons. The games are very unpredictable but are loved by the capital people. Children could be attacked by a wide range of creatures, or they could receive weapons ranging from guns to spears or swords. In the starving games, anything goes. The movie features some absolutely golden GEN-Z humor, which makes it a perfect fit. This is a spoof, so if you do not enjoy these types of things, I suggest you do not watch it\n\nThe story is about Kantpiss Evershot, who enters the games in place of her sister who she would protect at all costs. In the games, she meats the love of her life peter malarky. At home, her other love dale will do anything to break them apart, including entering the games and trying to kill peter. President snowballs also wants kantpiss dead, because he believes she will lead a revolution.\nEven though the creators of this amazingly hilarious film were shunned, I still think this is by far the greatest movie to ever exist. Some people just don't understand the plot and the humor. This movie was purposely made to look bad, and I think it does a really good job of conveying that message to the public. Even as a spoof people hate it, but to me, it's really great. People may hate Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer but I think they are extremely good at directing.\n\nThis movie is similar to other movies, but mostly the hunger games because it is a remake that is meant to be more funny and enjoyable. Some people say the original hunger games took inspiration from battle royal, even though the author has repeatedly denied it. Either way, it is pretty obvious that the starving games is a direct copy of the hunger games, except it has different humor, and gets a lot more hate.\n\n\nOverall, I can understand why people hate this movie so much. The humor is extremely childish, which will most likely not entertain adults. Some parts of the movie are just plain bad. The quality is not the best, and there are some flaws and unneeded parts in the storyline. An example would be superheroes at the end who die within 3 minutes. Overall, it's pretty bad. But someone with screwed-up GEN-Z humor would absolutely love it. I think it's good, others may disagree.",

While watching this movie i felt as if I was watching my ferret vomit out his own feces, this is an amazing movie. The jokes are elegant and I feel the need to run around screaming about how hilariously sussy this was. The acting is top notch, this is much better then the original. The original is actually a horrendous copy of this movie created by Putin's  team of spy drones. The sussy scenes in the movie are ultra realistic and I ship the rat found at 1:18 and the KatPiss (miss) together, they would make a great pair. In conclusion this movie is a cinematic masterpiece, I am so glad my Discord kitten reccomended we watch this because I was in awe at the time and effort put into this suspicious movie.",

In the end, the lead-poisoned populace will declare the winner to be The Hunger Games, but the two films know what happened on the battle field. They will both remember who held their ground in spite of all odds and who was valiant only in theory.\nUnlike the Hunger Games, this film does not try to deceive you by making you feel like you're the only one intelligent enough to understand its social commentary, nor does it rely on the mass retrograde amnesia that made the world forget about The Running Man, Battle Royale, or Stone Cold Steve Austin's film that also shared this tired old concept. This film is unabashedly sincere. It is not afraid to take it's place in hell.\nI implore all of the lonely, all of the oppressed, and all of the underdogs of the world to see this movie.

And now, after having watched the aforementioned film (if one can even call it that), I probably never will again.\n\nThis so-called \"comedy\" now has the dubious distinction of being the only movie from said genre to fail at evoking so much as even a chuckle from me. This isn't so much a film, as it is a collection of gross-out gags, terrible special effects, and dated pop culture references.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent comedic plot, look elsewhere, because the plot of \"The Starving Games\" is basically non-existent. The only way the \"plot\" of this \"film\" will make any sort of sense is based on the viewer's prior knowledge of \"The Hunger Games.\" The direction of the film is downright horrendous and it is a wonder that Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg continue to make these atrocities. The dialogue is absolutely terrible and some of the cringe-inducing jokes are repeated ad nauseam. \n\nNever before has a movie had me cringing the entire time I watched it. However, if I had the ability to give this movie a zero out of ten, I wouldn't. The reason for that is because of Maiara Walsh, who plays our heroine Kantmiss Evershot. Despite being stuck in one of the worst \"films\" ever made, she has the potential to break free from this side of Hollywood and even showcases a bit of talent, if only for brief flashes.\n\nFilled with pathetic attempts at humor, a nonsensical plot, terrible writing and directing, and mostly wooden acting, \"The Starving Games\" is the worst \"film\" I have ever seen. Never before has a comedy film failed to make me laugh. Do yourself a favor and watch anything else out there. It's bound to be better than this abomination (unless it's made by the same guys.)\n\n1/10",

It is the mosly and sadly unfunny spoof of the hit movie franchise.  There is a rare and occasional laugh...not not many.\r\n\r\nKantmiss Evershot (Maiara Walsh) is chosen to represent District 12 in the annual starving games.  She will compete against all the other kids from other districts.\r\n\r\nThe plot is obviously the same as \"The Hunger Games\", but its approach is totally different.  I think the movie franchise is ripe for skewering, but it needs to be actually funny in the process.\r\n\r\n[img]http://content8.flixster.com/rtmovie/10/96/109614_gal.jpg[/img]",

The ups is that: It has comedy moments, it can be  funny at times, it has action contained within the comedy storyline, the acting is decent, the special effects and visual effects are both okay and the cinematography was good. The downs is that the comedy moments were not that great or strong. This is 40 is much better. The acting wasn't terrible, but it came off as fake here and there. So it's not one of those great films. It's just your average everyday film. This could be an independent film in my opinion.\nThe casting was unknown to me. I have not seen any of these cast members in any film except this one.\n\nSadly, this film doesn't rank high. It is as we all know it, a pretty low quality film. Laughs are here and there, but there is no wow performances. So all in all it gets a 2 and a half stars for the acting. But for everything else it's a 2 rating. My advice is rent it. But do not buy it. Sorry folks, but to me, this film is bad except for the film's moments of comedy and acting.",

Throughout the whole film, I was laughing way too hard, but I was able to keep up with every single camera shot.. In short, the camera work was adequate, but not really fit for a true comedic film. I think that there should have been clearer shots especially during the chase scenes, as there were too many blurs.\n\nThis is a fairly short review because I just laughed harder than I should have. If you are looking for a cheesy Hunger Games spoof, and you have a great sense of humor, this film is for you. Give it a try, and may the odds be never in your favor.",

In the years that have followed, we've even seen franchises like, Scary Movie, Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Superhero Movie, but when was the last time you saw a spoof that was actually any good? Because of my love of the Hunger Games, I actually gave it's spoof a chance and I'm sorry I did. There were a lot of things here that could have been made fun of, but they weren't. The film gets so desperate that they actually turn to Avatar, The Avengers, and the action star of the Expendables, to make the thing long enough to be a full length film. I understand that the purpose behind spoof films is to be so ridiculous, that people laugh at how stupid it is, but there is a point where it is so beyond stupid and childish, that no one finds it funny anymore. The Starving Games quickly crosses this line and doesn't go back. It's a comedy making fun of one of my favorite series of all-time, a series I know like the back of my hand, and I hardly laughed. The only thing this film does well is cast actors who closely resemble the cast of the Hunger Games franchise. Beyond that, the acting is terrible, the jokes wouldn't even make children laugh, and the story is so out there, that eventually you're not even sure what they are doing. While spoofing big movies has become big business, this one does nothing but annoy everyone who was dumb enough to watch it.",

For a spoof movie, I was expecting at least a couple of laughs, but the director must have been about 2 years old because the whole thing just seemed immature and silly. The only thing that a found a little amusing was the Pink bearded Mr. T lookalike, but that was about it. Some parts go really over the top, and make you wonder if they actually watched the movie before they brought it out, which was why it went straight to DVD. You won't be seeing most of the actors again, so there isn't much to comment about there performances. At the end of the day, it's just another spoof movie. Disappointing!\n\nRound-Up:\nAs there dint that much out on DVD, I thought that I would give this movie a go, but I knew what to expect. I didn't really pay that much attention to the film after a whole because I just couldn't find anything funny. There are a few references to some other movies like The Avengers and The Expendables, but the director didn't do that much with the material. If you want loads of laughs then this is definitely not the movie for you, but if you want to play \"Name That Film\" then you should give it a go. A total waste of time and budget.\n\nBudget: $4.5million\nWorldwide Gross: N/A\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there spoof movies, but don't expect much from this a Hunger Games piss take. 2/10",

I've been railing against their misbegotten sense of comedy (really just pointless and soon-to-be-dated pop-culture references) for years, declaring three of their terrible spoof movies as my worst film of that year. There is no love lost between me and these two men, and yet I feel the sense to restrain my ire when it comes to their latest, The Starving Games. It's another witless comedy caper, this time using the popular Hunger Games series as its skeleton to hang its desperate jokes upon. These guys don't know what parody is, don't know the particulars of comedy and how to build and payoff a joke. It's the same pattern of ineptitude that will never change. Yet while sitting through all 80 laborious minutes of Starving Games, I felt like Friedberg and Seltzer have come to the realization that the end is nigh for their spoof careers. This last movie didn't get a theatrical release and the production values look chintzy even for them. They used to crank these lousy films out one a year; hell, in 2008 they gave us two. Now they've released two in the last five years. Usually they'll pack a celebrity or, barring that, MadTV alums. Even those are absent. That's right, even this movie couldn't snag a MadTV alum or D-list celeb. Perhaps, as I'd long prayed, the public has grown sour on Friedberg and Seltzer's misunderstanding of comedy and matured enough to realize that pointless references are not the same as parody. In all fairness, I did laugh two times in The Starving Games, both related to Diedrich Bader as President Snowballs. The lead actress, Maiara Walsh, displays a lot of potential. She's a good comic actress, has a tremendous smile, a memorable face, and sturdy poise to slough through this mess. She deserves a better movie and more opportunities.\n\nAt this point, you know what you're getting with Friedberg and Seltzer, and that's all you're going to get. However, I just looked online and discovered they have two movies scheduled for release next year, one a Fast and Furious parody (goody), and the other an honest to God spoof-free straight comedy. I'll be fascinated to see what these two have to offer when it comes to non-spoof comedy, but their background fills me with equal parts dread and derisive excitement. Hey, it can't be worse than InAPPropriate Comedy, could it?\n\nNate's Grade: D",

            "content": "At this point among filmdom (or whatever you choose call it film planet, film world, film committee, etc.) it's common knowledge to avoid anything by the duo of Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg. These two greatest contribution to cinema have always the years they didn't release a film. Unfortunately at this point in these the duo along with the people giving them jobs refuse to use their brains make a competent comedy.\r\n\r\nThe Starving Game is about Kantmiss Evershot fighting for her life in the 75th annual Starving Games. Like the duo previous films its plagues with the same issues; outdated film references, no comedic consequences, no pacing, non existence plot, absent of characters, to stupid to make fun of, beating a dead horse with every joke, and wasting the audience time. That's the whole film in a nutshell, but where it fails the most is being a basic parody of \"The Hunger Games\". It does not understand the definition of the word parody. That would have been asking to much from the writers who predict Lady Gaga will become president in the future. Instead of poking fun the film \"shaky cam\" by simply having a film crew capturing the action why not make a semi-political allegory on the Hollywood system downgrading intellectual properties. Then again, asking for actual minimal effort from the writers that only use \"The Expendables\" and \"The Avengers\" as throwaway gags instead of actual participants is a bit too much to expect. Now that I think about it that would have been a whole lot better, but who am I to judge the brilliance of movie where Kantmiss missing Peter as a giant cake next to her in the middle of the woods. Well to the writers credit they did copy the stupidity of that scene from the actual movie...though that's not a good thing either since it had no punch line in its delivery. Much like the film structure it seems my brains cells were not present in this paragraph. \r\n\r\nNarratively how does it all play out? If you seen \"The Hunger Games\" try to imagine the same plot points only brain dead slowly killing your brain cells being filled with unfunny overused jokes. Kantmiss offers herself to participate in the Starving Games (although everyone looks well fed, another miss point to satirize), Kantmiss faking her romance with Peter, underdeveloped little girl who helps Kantmiss gets kicked to death (let that sink in), underdeveloped romance, Kantmiss and Peter in a standoff finale. Talk about being uncreative stealing directly from the source material this duo is \"satirizing\". I will admit this film did make me laugh one time with a fake commercial for a hamburger (a mixture of pizza, ice cream, buns, vegetables, and other things). However, that joke is soon forgotten when M.I.A. appearce play the earrape known as \"Sexy and I Know It\" and the I don't understand humanity anymore popularity of Gangnam Style being killed off. Not that these musical references (including Taylor Swift) have no comedic purpose other than being completely superficial to the film just like its creation. Filled with incoherent sight gags, fart jokes, pointless pop culture references, and anything you could imagine from a duo set on destroying any fiber of humor. At least the acting talent despite being given awful material are okay. Diedrich Bader, bless him, who despite the godawful material he's given, still commits to his every line. Likewise, star Maiara Walsh has brief glimpses of talent, but they're usually spoiled a few seconds later by whatever cheap trick the movie has her doing next (like bird poop being thrown at her).\r\n\r\nThe Starving Game like it title will suggest leaves it does not fill its audience stomach for comedy. Saying this is for the lowest common denominator is an insult to the lowest common denominator. Even at under 83 minutes it fails to have enough material to support itself let alone entertain an audience. In vein of a bad rehashed sequel the duo rinse and repeats every mistakes they committed unable to comprehend the basics of how comedy works.",

Thankfully, I has a free rental so I didn't waste any money on this garbage. After sitting through Scary MoVie earlier this year, I thought that the spoof genre couldn't get worse. I was wrong. Friedberg and Seltzer (some guys that mainly make spoof movies and don't have a good movie to their names) shoot out as many boring pop culture references and gross out gags as they can and try to pass them out as a comedy. However, most, or maybe even all, of the jokes don't work and make for a painfully bad time. After this, I'm hoping that I never have to hear about those two morons ever again.",
