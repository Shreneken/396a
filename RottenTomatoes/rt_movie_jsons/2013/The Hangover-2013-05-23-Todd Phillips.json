    "summary": "It's been two years since the gang known as the Wolfpack narrowly escaped disaster in Bangkok. Now, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) have happy lives at home -- but Alan (Zach Galifianakis) doesn't. Still lacking contentment and a sense of purpose, Alan has gone off his meds and surrendered to his natural impulses. It's up to the other members of the Wolfpack to get him through his personal crisis by embarking on a road trip to the place it all began: Las Vegas.",

Obviously it's even more unrealistic than the first two but if you can't suspend your realism  for an hour to have a silly laugh, then you shouldn't be watching  any Hangover movie anyway. The downside is it focuses more on Alan who is the weakest character of the 3 for me but Phil and Stu are brilliant as always and there is a star turn from Melissa McCarthy. If it were up to me there would have been more of her character and less chow but still a good effort for a third instalment of something.",

This movie portrays him way too seriously and theres nothing funny about that. Its not even about a hangover which makes no sense since the movie is called Hangover.. I didnt even finish watching it because it was simply boring. \nI actually had a better idea as i was watching. What if the boys couldnt find Chang and he didnt trust them enough to meet so they thought theyd repeat the same they did the last 2 movies. Which was an actual hangover just so they can reconnect with him. And then they would forget what happend. And the plot goes on. That wouldve been fun.",

But, if you request I would write a detailed review for each movie too.\nThe series revolves around 4 friends, Philip(Bradley Cooper), Stu(Ed Helms), Alan ( Zach Galifianakis) and Doug ( Justin Bartha) and one more interesting, a recurring character, Chow (Ken Jeong), who is an international criminal but besides that, he is very funky.\nThe third and final part of the trilogy revolves around Alan, who after the untimely demise of his father decides to change his ways and start living with some new standards to renovate his life. But all things don't go as planned and the four again land into trouble when Chow's enemies abduct Doug. This film too is very entertaining but what I found is that it lost its very own essence of the hangover. In the film, you see only Chow enjoying the hangover, while the four are always in trouble. The film is very humourous and good comedy too but still I would highly recommend the previous parts over this especially the first one. But still, I would give this film a positive rating.",

Oh, and the giraffe's blood from its head splattered on a family's car with two young children inside the car which made them freak out. Did the writers and director seriously think that was funny? I did not even laugh one bit during this stupid, horrible, unfunny, lazily written movie. The acting in this movie is so horrible that it's not even one bit amusing. This movie was so painful to watch. Easily one of the worst comedies of all time. This movie isn't even remotely entertaining. I didn't even make it to the end of the movie, that's how god-awful it was.\n\nRating: 0.8/10",

            "content": "The Hangover Part III is a slight improvement over its predecessor but that's not really saying much. It offers a change of pace and a sense of nostalgia as we return to Las Vegas with the Wolfpack as we witness the return of Mike Epps as Black Doug and Heather Graham as Jade with the baby from the first film now four years old. I laughed a little but Hangover III isn't a comedy, it just isn't. As an action thriller it can be entertaining to watch. I think I figured out the mystery to this movie. It's actually an excuse to give Alan a girlfriend without revisiting the same formula as the first. This movie is meant to focus on Alan's character development, And since he's the center of attention, he's mostly the same idiot he was in the last two movies. Yet he's super unlikable in this movie since his ignorance comes off as more annoying than in the first two movies where he at least had some common sense. Here, he just listens to music while his father dies of a heart attack behind him. Yes, he is stupid but this is really giving off a bad impression of him. Ken Jeong and John Goodman really shine here. In fact, if Todd Phillips made a spin-off movie about Chow, I'd actually go see it. The ending makes it clear that this is the last movie in the trilogy...unless greedy executives decide to make a Hangover Part 0 focusing on Bradley Cooper's wedding since he's the only member of the Wolfpack who was already married before the first film. The Hangover Part III is an uninspired, mean-spirited, dark conclusion to the trilogy that isn't even sure if it's supposed to be comedic though it improves in some aspects compared to Part II. Maybe one day Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis will recollaborate. Probably something that is unrelated to the Hangover...until the executives make a last-minute plot twist that establishes that that particular movie takes place in the same universe as The Hangover since shared universes are all the rage nowadays.",

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Scott, I m afraid I m suffering from a hangover watching the third and final installment of The Hangover franchise.\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) But just knowing it s the final installment makes the hangover a little less painful.\n\nGREG: In The Hangover 3, our heroes Phil, Stu, and Doug (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha) have decided that quirky Wolfpack friend Alan (Zach Galifianakis) needs to check into a rehab clinic. The four take off for Arizona but they don t get far before they are run off the road by a crew of Pig-masked ruffians who take them hostage.\n\nSCOTT: The ruffians work for a drug lord named Marshall (John Goodman), who has been robbed of millions of dollars of gold by the master of disaster, Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong). Blaming the Wolfpack, Marshall kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him unless the remaining three men reclaim the gold and bring him Chow.\n\nGREG: And we re off. The original Hangover movie started out with the Wolfpack waking up from a collective hangover having lost the groom (Doug). They were then on a quest to find the him and figure out why there was a tiger, baby, and missing tooth. It was crazy, frenzied, and a lot of fun. This movie has none of that. It plods along from point A to point B with our heroes never in any real danger and never a moment of surprise.\n\nSCOTT: As with most sequels, this film can t measure up to the surprising entertainment value of the original movie, which derived much of its fun from the fact that we had several nerdy professionals who were in way over their heads. This formula really can t be milked more than once. I do give the filmmakers some credit for transforming the main hero of the story, Alan, from a mentally deranged individual to a somewhat healed and loveable character at the end. But as you pointed out, Greg, the adventures that our heroes face are not terribly interesting and Alan s transformation rings false.\n\nGREG: I m at a loss to find anything interesting about the characters in this movie. There is no conflict whatsoever. The three leads all get along and Phil and Stu treat Alan like a kid brother rather than the pain in the neck that he is. I don t think we ve seen as dull an ensemble since The Big Wedding. This could have been salvageable if Phil and Stu started out feeling animosity toward Alan. Then they would have someplace to go. They could find that Alan is a special person worthy of their love and affection. But I think that s what happened in the first two movies. In The Hangover 3 a lot of emphasis was placed on Alan s quirkiness - his operatic singing voice, his boylike innocence, and his affections for newcomer Melissa McCarthy.\n\nSCOTT: Those are good suggestions, Greg, but I think the main problem is that this movie didn t know what it wanted to be. Alan is introduced to us as a goofball lunatic who decapitates animals and wishes his mother dead at his father s funeral. That suggests a dark comedic tone. But that s not what the film ultimately delivers. There are elements of comedy, drama, and romance that don t mix well together. The movie floundered and I was left not really caring how things would wrap up at the end.\n\nGREG: This was a lackluster finale to a series that started out well but failed to deliver. It was better than some of the poorer offerings we ve seen this year, but not by much. The Hangover 3 earns 2 Reels out of 5. The buddy element of the film really didn t hold the rest of the movie together and none of the characters really grew much. I give them just 2 Heroes out of 5. Movie: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: The Hangover 3 didn t quite plummet to the depths reached by the year s most egregious cinematic failure, The Big Wedding. But it was a disappointing and lackluster effort nonetheless. There were a few mildly amusing moments in the film that earn it 2 Reels out of 5. The heroes failed to move me on any level. Phil, Stu, and Doug were pretty much all interchangeable, and the villain Marshall woefully underutilized John Goodman s talents. I give the film some credit for attempting to transform Alan, but it was a half-hearted and unconvincing effort. So like you, I give the hero characters in this movie just 2 Heroes out of 5.

Breaking out of Thai prison, the wolf pack returns to the scene their original crime, Sin City. \n\nWhere the initial instalments success lay in its concept reliability of four guys out to celebrate, and the theory, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. As an ex-pat of the gambling capital of the world myself, this statement not only allows, but somehow drives peoples  to do the craziest of things on the excuse that whatever their secret, it is safe. \n\nPart II attempted to recreate the theory in a seedier locale to avoid claims of regurgitation and failed so in Part III the misconceived scriptwriters opted for a watered down dreg of its original self with about as much success. With a mish mash of over-the-top skits that don't quite fit together and the misplaced plot being driven by minor characters; viewers are left scratching their head and pondering why for all the wrong reasons. \n\nAlthough the addition of Goodman was a wise choice, Galifianakis and Jeong work far too in their attempt to conjure laughter. Cooper and Helms seem somehow neglected whilst the always sidelined Bartha is literally forgotten.  It is fun to see Heather Graham back, even in its minimalist capacity.\n\nThe Verdict: When it comes to comedy franchises, sometimes drinking the spiked cool aide is not worth headache. \n\nPublished: The Queanbeyan Age\nDate of Publication: 24/05/2013",

When I heard that the third one was going to be different in terms of plot from the previous films and it's also the last film, I was looking forward to see what they're going to bring, but man was this one bad. The acting is good, and John Goodman can act intimidating as a villain, even he was completely wasted in this as his character wasn't written well. Even though the plot is different, what they put in however, is a complete weak one that felt like it was stretched out. The humor in it wasn't funny, and I didn't laugh even once, which is sad as I found the previous films to be really funny. The movie feels lazy like it's not trying at times in terms of explaining things. Zack's character feels unpleasant as he gets very rude, which is not funny even though the movie said that he's off his medication which worked to its own disadvantage. The only time that I laughed, was the ending because it would've been a funnier set up than this plot, even if it's very similar. With all that said and done, I honestly didn't hate it as I still was abut interested in the film, even though the mystery of it is gone, there were some amusing moments in here, and Melissa McCarthy wasn't bad in it, heck, given with the right material, her character would've been very funny. Even though it's different from the other films, it does feel very pointless and is not a good ending point for the series that it might as well have the same plot as the previous films because at least it'll be funnier than what we got for this.",

A rehashing failed, but a new leap forward still can't quite deliver in the same way. \nVERDICT: Cut out the second, this is what the sequel should have been like.

It was like the producers woke up one morning and decided, \"You know what we should do with Hangover 3?  Make it like Die Hard,\" and ran with it, ignoring all the things that made Die Hard and the Hangover successful.  What they got was an at best mediocre wanna-be action movie that has no idea where it's going or why anyone should care.\nComedy sequels don't often work due to repeating the same material that made the original successful, which meant this was in trouble from the start, but when you take the same characters and divert them so drastically, you get nowhere unless you find new ground to break, which was not done.

The main problem I have with The Hangover Part 3 is the fact that it only relies on its stars' likability and leaves out the witty humor. I was one of the few people who kind of enjoyed Hangover 2, but this is where I draw the line. The film lacks any humor. I assume it took about 10 minutes total to think of all the jokes in the film. I will give the film props for trying something new with the formula. Nobody gets drunk, you're not trying to figure out the mystery of the night before. It tries to be somewhat of an action comedy, but lacks all the comedy. The film failed to deliver anything interesting. It was a good effort, but ultimately a failed one. And if you had a drinking game for all the times they said Chow was crazy, you'd die of alcohol poisoning before the film ends. We know he's crazy, okay, there's no reason to tell us that 70,000 times!",

Its title is the Hangover Part III, and I'm curious. Where exactly does the hangover element come in? A film with hangover in its title and yet no hangover, Hollywood really have gone down the toilet bowl into the sewers of sh@#%. This film COULD have been ok if the hangover plot was replaced with something original but, alas, it is not. The plot of the previous two is replaced with something that aims for dark comedy but skews into an action thriller. The characters are kind of annoying now and it seems only Bradley Cooper knows he's actually not in a good film. Both Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms have greatly overstayed their welcome and are just irritating and stupid. John Goodman plays a one-dimensional character and Ken Jeong made me want to shoot myself. Also of note: a film with Melissa Mcarthy post-bridesmaids is doomed to be utterly unfunny. The Hangover Part III is repetitive, overlong and laughless. Sorry, I should have said The Stupid Action Thriller Mess Part III is repetitive, overlong and laughless",

Hey Phil. \n\nHonestly, the idea had become stale and judging by how badly executed the second installment was, I didn't really expect anything special from this film either. Surprisingly, I liked it better than the second but still not as good as the first film. Also, I like that the flashbacks in the end, where the \"wolf pack\" were all walking together nicely tied all three films together and gave it a bit of closure; however, I disliked the extra scenes during the credit which made it seem that there would be future installments of the franchise since I felt there was nothing left to say. Another thing, the original guys were cute and they still had good chemistry (Bradley Cooper never did it for me but OMG! for some reason he was extra hot in this flick. I don't know why) John Goodman is always awesome and Ken Jeong was a riot but even his Chow was getting tiresome.  Ed Helms was okay. Zach Galifianakis  was tolerable but his shtick was old and lame by this point and I understand that Melissa McCarthy is the gal du jour of comedy for the moment but I find nothing about her funny and I think she a bit overrated. Yeah, so overall the film was a big bowl of okay so I think it's time to pack this franchise up and put it way; it was funny for its time but their moment has passed. Time to close the book on it and let them pursue other projects: hopefully funnier and with some fresh ideas (although in Hollywood now-a-days, fresh ideas is about as rare as long and happy marriages).",

Sure the Wolf Pack returned with few good stars and few from the original that started the trilogy and being the best, along with different comedic approach that barely reach the comedic level of its predecessor.

The trilogy goes out with a'poof' as opposed to a 'bang' as its a subpar movie that is riddled with incredibly unfunny moments and a boring plot. I'm not sure how this was classified as a 'comedy' as there were no real funny moments. I did not laugh once and the run-time for this movie was an hour and 40 minutes. The movie tries to involve some nostalgia to help itself but all it does is remind you of both the success of humour in the first movie and the failure of the 2nd movie and highlights just exactly how bad this installment is. The plot is ridiculous and boring; not even carrying the movie or even wanting the audience to follow. This is just another example of how too much of one thing can be bad as all the characters just try too hard to be funny and Zach being the worst of them all. Don't get me wrong; he is capable of being funny; just not in this movie. He's done the man-baby role in other movies and actually delivered laughs so it's not completely his fault as the script is atrocious. There's nothing else to even comment on so let's get straight to point; not recommended, not even for a rental. 2/10",

It is one scene of many that best exemplifies Hollywood's use of scrapping the barrel with little to no worry about being shameless. The following year, director Todd Philips struck three 7's on the slot machine with The Hangover, a wickedly funny and entertaining comedy set to the backdrop of the Las Vegas mirage, and struck the jackpot. After four years (and the carbon copied, Thai-spiced Part II), Philips should have taken the comical nuance of Lazarus' words to heart, because The Hangover Part III is the cinematic equivalent to Speedman's fictional performance, a film that went \"full retard.\" To start is the filmmaker's decision to make the character of 'Alan,' Zach Galifianakis' man-child, the vocal point of the story. His eccentricity and weird tendencies are great in small doses, but what follows is a barrage of attempts of stupid humor and bad, physical comedy from the bearded one for 100 minutes. The tiresome gags reeks of the film of having no energy or drive to anything going on behind or in front of the camera (except John Goodman, who is the only person trying). The lack of excitement clearly affected Bradly Cooper (probably distracted by David O. Russell) and Ed Helms, who phone in the same jokes they made funny back in 2009. Yes, those jokes are still great, but how many times are we going to laugh at the same thing? The lack of incentive to innovate in the comedy infects The Hangover Part III from the ground up, ultimately treating the audience to a violent (the writer's don't like animals), Adam Sandler-style brand of comedy, where there is no shame in being shameless apparently.",

As opposed to the second film, which came across as stale and mean-spirited, this one is far more refreshing to me, and is just an insane amount of fun. The creators elected to do what I had kind of assumed they'd do for a Hangover sequel from the moment I first heard they were making a second one, which is take the same characters that made the original formula work and put them in an entirely different story (but with fun nods to previous events). This movie isn't even really in the same genre or category that you'd put the last two in, which I like. I appreciate it when risks/liberties are taken with the material. This one plays kind of like something written by Shane Black or Joss Whedon; tense action/adventure sequences (that are actually extremely well directed) punctuated with lots of humor. Not so much a lowbrow comedy like either of the first two, bur rather more of a crowd-pleasing, light-hearted thriller with situational gags. There are moments of real raunchiness and stupid humor, but they feel more self-aware, almost as if Phillips is poking you in the ribs and saying, \"Isn't this stupid?\" Overall, this franchise has grown up a bit at this point, I'd say, which seems quite intentional given the ending. Things actually get kinda sentimental, which is odd. Although it's all well done, you may find yourself scratching your head at the notion that a Hangover film is actually trying to be sweet, until... well, I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say, be sure to stick around once the credits roll.",

Part III falls very short of the previous two, there's an over abundance of Mr.Chow and Alan, whilst poor Stu and Phil plod behind them desperately trying to get screen time amongst the weirdness of Chow and Alan. However, Heather Graham returns, she's sweet and I'm glad she returned alongside grown up Carlos. Melissa McCarthy is actually funnier than the whole wolf pack put together in the few scenes she gets, plus John Goodman is excellent as the guy that kidnaps Doug and sets the Wolf Pack on yet another adventure that stalls here and there but pays off nicely, closing off the franchise, hopefully because another adventure will just be pushing it as the material is getting dry.

It still pales in comparison to the original movie, but at least it does not feel like we have seen this movie before. While it is marginally better than the second movie in some ways, it still has its own set of problems. This time the story is too serious and dark. Zach Galifianakis no longer seems like the funny wild card. His character is troubled and in need of help from his family and friends. This is the wrong tone for this series. These characters are funny, but caring and sentimental they are not. This movie makes a fatal flaw and quintuples the amount of Mr. Chow. Ken Jeong is hilarious as his signature character, but making him a main part of this story proves to be too much off a good thing. Worst of all the chemistry between Galifianakis, Ed Helms, and Bradley Cooper is fading. It looks like they are just taking a layup and cashing a big check in this one. Even John Goodman and Mellissa McCarthy cannot inject new life in this. With any luck at all this will be the final chapter.",

The film occasionally gives out laughs (which is good) but spends most of the time brimming the audience with its dimly-themed action scenes entailing gangster fights and ineffective twists between its characters. Also, the viewer gets to be set on a strangely unfamiliar feel throughout the movie since the amusing vibe that made its predecessors a hit have been cut off. \nI honestly didn't think this final installment gave justice to its phenomenal kick-off. If Director Phillips ever thinks of recreating this concluding chapter, he should give it a shot.",

I kinda ha low expectations for this one thinking it would be the exact same as Part I and Part II. Mr. Chow and Alan are the stars of the show, and I didn't mind that. Stu has seemed to change a bit. With his glasses, his attitude towards Alan, and how he is more calm and relaxed throughout with the exception of being kidnapped with the Wolfpack. I've noticed this one is more of a drama than a comedy. Though it has comedy in it, it has dark humor in the film. Such as a giraffe being decapitated, Black Doug being shot, Chow snapping 2 dogs necks(never seen, just mentioned), Alan wishing his mother to die before his father, and chickens being murdered. This humor made the movie more interesting. The ending with the flashbacks of the Wolfpack walking together from Part I and Part II was very emotional especially with the music. The post credits scene is amazing with the humor it brings as well! Overall, I really enjoyed this movie because of the plot difference and the drama and humor it gives you.",
