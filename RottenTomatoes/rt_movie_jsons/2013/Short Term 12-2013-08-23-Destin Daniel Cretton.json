It does well to be uplifting without short-selling the pain and the trauma, the times you feel useless as you sit in the hurricane of pain in front of you and the way that awakens echoes of your own pain. \n\nBrie Larson's low-key, brilliant central performance shows what we'd see later down the track in Room as well as Marvel movies, that she's more than able to carry a film, and really connect us to the emotional core of the film. The supporting cast is also excellent, with special mention to Lakeith Stanfield and John Gallagher Jr.",

After reading up on director Destin Daniel Crettin (who is a new favorite of mine after this and Shang Chi), his personal history working in a group facility for teenagers is clearly felt. Having worked in a related field for most of my adult life, his screenplay is true to life - complete with its ups, downs, and the free flowing relationship residents have with staff workers. The story, while heartbreaking at times, moves gracefully and shows real empathy for its characters. It is interesting as it more focused on the staff than the residents of the group home, which is an avenue that has been rarely explored in films. While the in facility story resonated much more with me than the out of facility story concerning Grace and Mason's romantic relationship, this is a great movie.",

The chemistry between Grace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher, Jr.) was a delight. Rami Malek's character, Nate, on the other hand, was a complete waste of space. I understand he's supposed to be the vessel through which we are pushed into the group home ‚Äî the film begins on his first day as a volunteer ‚Äî but he is so out of place and ineffective that he reminded me of one of those good-intentioned American teenagers who go to Africa to build homes, only to have the locals re-do the work at night. The intimacy of the camerawork, if at times claustrophobic, made the home feel tight and on-edge, even when engaging in something as simple as morning work group ‚Äî you know, the typical seated circle where feelings are to be discussed, always to the chagrin on its circulants (word mine). I also wanted to note Kaitlyn Dever's performance as Jayden, the snarky, borderline acerbic, newcomer to the home whose story becomes central to Grace's arc. My only real gripe is why did Grace immediately make the appointment for an abortion, then tell Mason they're having a baby and accept his proposal, only to revert back to her original decision (which she then flip-flops on again)? It felt like the whole reason for the initial appointment was so she could drop the line \"I already made the appointment\". Was it supposed to be a trial run of some sort and she reserved her spot in case she wasn't satisfied with the results? Wherever this was, it didn't seem like abortion openings were few and far between. The tear-jerker ending was deserved and satisfying.",

This could have been a story full of cliches. But the characters and situations feel authentic. The dialogue feels natural and unforced. Even though there are some pretty dark themes running through the movie and, while grounded in suffering, it is ultimately inspiring and life affirming, providing the viewer with a powerful perspective on what it means to be a young person who is faced with adult neglect and abuse through their formative years.

            "content": "Loving and empathetic to its characters' pain.\n\nDestin Daniel Cretton's indie drama Short Term 12 (2013) is an emotionally devastating ordeal of such great sadness and profound catharsis with a mellow vibe. The openness of the cinematography is so freeing and feels genuine like you are watching real interactions in the daily lives of people suffering from trauma or grief. Cretton's melancholic tone makes Short Term 12 a hard watch, but it is so beautiful and rewarding. The hopeful ending is satisfying and uplifting to a degree.\n\nCretton takes a simple premise of a young woman, who is hiding the fact that she herself was abused by her perverted father, while she now helps those in similar situations to a reflective state. Short Term 12 sees Cretton write several realistic characters all going through pain of some kind in a neglected youth center similar to a film like Girl, Interrupted, but Short Term 12 is filmed closer to Room. Cretton's writing has no frills or fraudulence to it, his style is realism grounded in the coping process like how people actually try to recover and rehabilitate in actual life. Thus, Cretton's thoughtful dreamy direction gives Short Term 12 a truly empathetic feel alongside his authentic script. Destin Daniel Cretton is quite the writer and director.\n\nBrie Larson is inspired as Grace. Her clear inner strength is projected outwards to aid these teenagers by using her own pain and insecurities to empower others. Larson is so moving as she brings a genuine warmth and impressive anguish in how she displays Grace's doubts. She gives such a nuanced performance in Short Term 12, that Larson was already preparing for her magnificent role in Room, wherein she pulls off an even more devastating performance. Brie Larson needs to continue her dramatic acting in the vein of Short Term 12 and Room as she is just marvelous at it.\n\nJohn Gallagher Jr. is so heartwarming and patient as the sympathetic Mason. He is quite funny and endearing. His acting gives an optimistic look on all the horror around him as he tries to cope with his own girlfriend Grace's issues. Gallagher Jr. gives an excellent foil role as Mason to Larson's powerful leading lady Grace.\n\nI must mention the standout young actress Kaitlyn Dever (Booksmart) as she is sublime as Jayden. You feel so bad for her, while liking her wise cracking teenage girl character. Dever is one of the best young actresses working in Hollywood today as Short Term 12 displayed her potential and Booksmart achieved it. She acts on the same level as Brie Larson, which is about as high of praise as I can give here.\n\nFurthermore, LaKeith Stanfield is really gripping as Marcus. You see a deep pain as Marcus raps his frustrations, fears, and aggression against his mother out in a touching honest scene. His story is as tragic as anyone's in Short Term 12. Stanfield is outstanding as a dramatic actor. Between Short Term 12, Selma, Straight Outta Compton, War Machine, Get Out, and Sorry to Bother You, I would say that Stanfield is here to stay. His range is impressive and he continues to astonish me.\n\nThe lovely score from Joel P. West is mesmerizing and adds a serene warmth giving Short Term 12 a Summer vibe. Despite the dark subject matter and complex themes, the music in the movie is certainly beautiful.\n\nLastly, Rami Malek is neat as the new guy named Nate, but he's really just a glorified cameo. His supporting role is mostly a surrogate for the audience to have an ally experiencing all the anguish of Short Term 12 along with to ease our viewing session. He is very good at making specific facial expressions of shock or sorrow.\n\nIn all, Short Term 12 is a fantastic indie drama from director Destin Daniel Cretton. Brie Larson is as inspiring and engaging in Short Term 12 as she is in her more acclaimed role in Room. LaKeith Stanfield gets a cool acting debut feature film and we get a robust film to endure and enjoy.",

When Grace finds out she is pregnant, she schedules an appointment for an abortion; she eventually tells Mason about the pregnancy, who is overjoyed. She does not tell him she plans to have an abortion. At their facility, Grace and Mason focus their efforts on Marcus (Lakeith Stanfield), a resident who is about to turn 18 and is struggling with the prospect of leaving the facility. Meanwhile, Nate (Rami Malek) begins his first day as a supervisor at the facility. Grace bonds with Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), a recent arrival at Short Term 12 who has a history of self-harm. Jayden distances herself from the other teenagers, as she does not intend to stay at the facility for long. When her father fails to pick her up on her birthday, she reacts violently toward the staff. After her outburst, she sits in the \"cool-down room\" with Grace, who shows Jayden her own scars from cutting herself. That night, Jayden leaves the facility in the middle of her birthday celebrations. Unable to force her to return, Grace follows Jayden to her father's house. After finding the house empty, they return to Short Term 12. When Jayden reads Grace a cryptic story she has written, Grace begins to suspect that Jayden was abused by her father...\n\n\"Short Term 12\" premiered on March 10, 2013 at South by Southwest, where it won the Grand Jury and Audience Awards for a Narrative Feature. The film was widely acclaimed. Critics praised its realism and intimacy, with particular attention drawn to Larson's performance and Cretton's screenplay and direction. The film is considered one of the best films of 2013, appearing on several critics' year-end lists.\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Short Term 12 is an emphatic, revealing drama that pulls audiences into the perspective of neglected youths. Germain Lussier of /Film wrote of the film, \"The whole thing just feels perfect or magical, a shining example of what cinema is all about\", adding, \"The performances are mindblowing, the writing sharp, and the direction beautiful. It's a very special movie.\" In Variety, critic Peter Debruge wrote, \"the stunning SXSW fest winner puts the recent Park City competition lineup to shame ... this compelling human drama finds fresh energy in the inspirational-teacher genre, constantly revealing new layers to its characters.\" In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan described Short Term 12 as \"a small wonder\", \"a film of exceptional naturalness and empathy\", and \"moving and intimate\", offering particular praise to the film's honesty and plausibility. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, on the other hand, criticized the film's credibility, describing it as \"well intentioned, but somehow inauthentic\" with a \"too-cute-to-be-true ending\".\n\nThere¬¥s something truly compelling with this indie drama, despite the fact it is a \"traditional\" indie drama in many ways so to say. We have a main character in Grace that struggles in life and at the same time tries to help others in their struggle. I really really like Brie Larson as she has such a natural way of acting and she really becomes her character. It¬¥s a joy to see her on the screen. As Katie Walsh of Indiewire wrote, \"[Larson] manages to convey her character as someone fierce and strong and steely, and also utterly fragile, delicate, scared and broken ... It's an incredible emotional and physical performance, and she's a whirlwind.\" That is spot on. \"Short Term 12\" has that lingering feeling of authenticity and almost being a documentary, which makes you really believe in what you see on the screen. Destin Daniel Cretton has directed this film with a strong hand and Brie Larson shows what a great actress she is. I like that the film is dialogue driven and the set pace gives the characters breathing space in their emotional journeys. \"Short Term 12\" is a great little indie drama despite being a \"traditional\" indie film as said.

Her character, Grace, is a young woman in charge of the day-to-day care of the troubled kids who inhabit a short term foster care facility.  Looking after the kids comes naturally to Grace, but she struggles with the hardships of her own life. When her center takes on a new young girl, Grace is reminded of her own unspeakable past.\n\nBrie Larson will turn in great performances for a long time. If you liked Room, you'll love Short Term 12. Larson's humanity is so closely tied in her warmth and vulnerability. It's painful to think of the situations some kids call reality, but the characters' authenticity provide a semblance of guidance and comfort, even when they don't all have it for themselves. Mr. Robot's Rami Malek also delivers a solid performance as the newest staff member who realizes he may be in over his head.\n\nWhile the movie is excellently shot and scored, I was most impressed was how well the screenplay handled exposition.  Nothing needed to be explained, and nothing was over explained. You are given exactly what you need to know and nothing more, and it's dealt in a way that never feels ham-fisted. Instead, you grow to care for the characters because of the subtlety, not because you're told to care for them.  Short Term 12 packs some emotion but is full of hopeful laughs and smiles. Maybe keep a chopped onion close by so you have an excuse.",

Destin Daniel Cretton; the writer-director, surpasses its witty script through his brilliant execution skills and offers an adequate response to the raised questions in here. Brie Larson pulls off her role convincingly despite not getting the expected support from her supporting cast. It is short on technical aspects like sound department but is fulfilling in editing and its camera work which makes it pleasing to encounter as it keeps it light; contradict to its premise. The minor dilemma in here would be the priority of the character and its perspective that is kept above the plot track which bars the range of the feature a bit.

The writing by the director is well-written and tight that it understands the drama of the situation and what the children, even the people working there, are going through as Destin Daniel Cretton actually have some experience of working in a facility like that. It feels very realistic, and also very human as people care about each other, even if they don't show it. The pacing is slow, but it still keeps you interested thanks to the acting, the writing, and the likable characters that'll entertain you while also giving a lot of sense of heart.",

The story of a social worker trying to deal with the problems of others while struggling fervently with her own is presented so humanely that you quickly begin to accept that these are not actors portraying the problems, but real people living them. Brie Larson, in the role that allegedly won her the Oscar-winning lead in Room, is fantastic. She has a permanent look of weariness constantly stuck behind a barrier of optimism and false smiles. What she goes through might be a little clich√©, but it's handled sensitively, and Larson's ability to pull us into what she's going through keep it grounded and believable. The child actors are especially good, and inject their parts with enough flair and gravitas that they're not completely outdone by the adults.

A film with a natural aesthetic needs to rely on its actors and scenarios to anchor it, tighten it, draw you into its world and fell for that world's inhabitants. Short Term 12 has a typically underwhelming opening, but one perhaps rife for larger metaphor.\nAs a bunch of camp workers stand around sharing a rather crude story, we get a sense of a very relaxed, mumblecore tone being established. They are a bunch of late twentysomethings, directionless, moping about and telling stories. It is the kind of indie film pastiche seen many time. Yet suddenly, a disturbed child rushes from an adjacent door and hurtles towards an exit. Suddenly, there is panic and shouting, the mood becomes tense. This is the essence of Short Term 12 . From the relaxed tone of mumblecore comes real shock and, occasionally, real darkness.\nYes, the camp is a camp for troubled youths. Where escape attempts are but minor worries when put in context of suicide attempts. Indeed, any plot arch that attempts to reach outside the realm of the camp almost seems futile. For instance, I'm struggling to even remember the presence of a romance between Grace (Brie Larsen) and Mason (John Gallagher Jr) after the fact, as the discussion will no doubt center so strongly on the scene involving the teens. Petty squabbles become major threats, and any attempt to get to close to troubled youths may be dangerous.\nThe film's universe carries the sort of consequences inherent to a war film. A rap performance in particular may leave you breathless; a scene in which the teens decorate a fellow housemates walls carries devastating weight. Yet, the film has an optimistic undercurrent, one that manifests in the viewer a possible fulfillment amidst emotional exhaustion.",

            "content": "With SPECTRE and THE HUNGER GAMES dominating the box office of late, the cinemas won't be showing anything worth our time and money until STAR WARS arrives in three weeks' time. That makes it a good time to look at some gems that may have missed our attention. One of these is SHORT TERM 12, which was released in 2013 but never made it to Hong Kong. It stars Brie Larson, a name that may not mean much to you now but will very soon. Her latest film, ROOM, was released in the US yesterday and should make it to our shores in early 2016. The advance word on the film is extremely positive. It has been playing the festival circuit since September and has already racked up eight awards there. I mentioned Brie in one of my early reviews, DON JON. She has a very small part in that film but she makes it a memorable one. She also appeared in THE SPECTACULAR NOW, which was one of my favourite films of 2014.\n\nGrace (Larson) works as a supervisor at a short-term group home for emotionally broken teenagers. The kids are supposed to stay there for less than a year - until the county figures out what to do with them - but, as we learn, some, like Marcus (Keith Stanfield), are there for more than three years. Grace and her three fellow counsellors have a huge job on their hands and it wouldn't be surprising if they cracked under pressure but they all seem to be able to handle each day's challenges with a heady mix of professionalism, empathy, humour, gravity and a bit of exhaustion. Grace, herself, is soft-spoken but she's not afraid to enforce the facility's rules - no closed doors, no profanity spoken, and no unauthorised leaving. Thankfully, most of the kids understand the rules and appreciate her tough love approach but there are a couple of kids who are still too deeply troubled to be able to stay on track all the time.\n\nGrace's guarded world slowly starts to unravel when three big events hit her at the same time - she learns that she's pregnant; she receives word that her father will be released from prison; and Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), a new charge, arrives at the home bearing emotional and physical scars that Grace seems to understand a little too well. Though she is well able to overcome the trust issues that the kids have, she can't seem to be able to tear down her own wall, particularly when it comes to her boyfriend and co-worker, Mason (John Gallagher Jr.; TV's THE NEWSROOM).\n\nSHORT TERM 12 was written and directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, who once worked in a California facility similar to this one. His experiences there formed the basis of a short film of the same name that he wrote in university as his thesis project. It was released in 2008 to great praise. The long version of the film has been a festival darling since it premiered at the SXSW Film Festival in March 2013. There, it won both the Grand Jury and Audience awards, and 32 more awards at other festivals from Abu Dhabi to Mexico.\n\nThere are a couple of scenes in the film (Marcus' rap song and Jayden's children's story) that will absolutely break your heart but this film is far from being mawkish. All the performances are delivered with such sincerity you may just think that these actors understand abuse on a firsthand level. Larson's quiet and sensitive performance, though, really stands out in this work that is both solidly written and directed. As much as Grace would like to like to sublimate her own past, the events that surround her won't let her. Through her, the kids and even Mason, we see that while you can cover up the scars, they remain with you long after the abuse ends.",

Grace seems to know the right approach to penetrating even the sturdiest veneer, but that understanding stems from similar incidents in her own past that she's never truly addressed. It can often seem easier to show others the way than to do the same for yourself, I suppose. Surrounding Larsen is an excellent set of supporting efforts, helmed by John Gallagher Jr. as her big-hearted secret boyfriend/coworker, but the real show-stealers are the kids themselves. Each touched with a turgid, tragic set of challenges all their own, they succeed at portraying mistrust, resentment, anger, helplessness... and, strikingly, an innate sense of community. Their complexities are the keys to this story, gateway to a dark world that many of us would never dare to explore on our own. Efficient, emotional, intense but not oppressive - tension-breakers arrive in all the right moments - this was a wonderful surprise, and something that's bound to stick with me for some time.",

John Gallagher Jr is also terrific here as a fellow co-worker and long-term boyfriend to Larson's character who seems incapable of making her happy, which drives a majority of the hard-hitting drama in the film. As said, this film is pretty bleak at times due to the frank realism; each troubled youth suffering from their individual nuances, but it's also uplifting seeing how much the staff care about helping people and you leave the film feeling fulfilled emotionally. The story takes some predicable turns (and a few way out of left-field) but overall this is a solid drama that stands out due to the exceptional performances from the two leads and the serious handling of the subject matter is praise-worthy.",

I absolutely LOVED this film, I'm usually an action movie guy, mostly out of fear of being bored to death, but I will dip my toes into other material. Everything about this film is perfect. The plot is so interesting and grabs you tightly especially in its third act. The actors and actresses were all fantastic, I knew Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr were going to be fantastic here, it's what I've come to expect. The huge surprise was the actor who played Marcus. Holy. Shit. He absolutely blew me away and was such an interesting character who I really wanted to know more about. The guy didn't talk much and every time the actor made his dialogue somehow the ones I wanted to hear the most. The dialogue was amazing, I really was hanging onto every word said because it all seemed so real and yet otherworldly. The plot was incredibly interesting and it gave a ton of surprises that really worked for me. It gave an array of very intriguing characters that I wanted to know more and more about no mater how much was revealed about them. The ending was extremely satisfying and gave a real sense of everything being alright despite the recent turmoil these people went through. I know it will never happen, but I really want to see something showing these characters a few years or months later, especially the Marcus character, I don't know where I'd rank it in all time performances I've ever seen, but it's definitely a favorite of mine especially since it would've been so easy to make the guy just an angry little shit that would've got annoying after a while, but Keith Stanfield really gave Marcus something extra. Short Term 12 is by far one of the best films I have ever seen, and I would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone",

            "content": "\"Short Term 12\" is a powerful story of resiliency and the transformative power of love.  This genuine, honest portrayal of troubled teenagers is based on the real life experiences of director Destin Daniel Cretton.  Many of the characters and scenarios in the story are based on people that he encountered while working at a group facility.  It is a chilling dose of realism that will immediately engage your empathy toward teens that come from bad family situations.  Stylistically, the film uses just enough shakey cam to make it feel personal but not so much that it makes you sick.  Once it draws you in to its reality, there are a few inevitable tearjerker moments but it is nice to see that every drama does not have to end in the depths of depression.  There are even a few moments that will make you laugh!  My only issue with the script is the excessive language.  I agree that much of the profanity spoken by the teens in the facility is absolutely necessary to create the realism of their mental situations.  My issue is with the conversations of the workers.  A film like this needs to give the audience a break from the profanity so that we do not become desensitized.  By including f-words and s-words in every scene, they become less potent in the most powerful moments of the film.  While the film is set up for success with this profound script, it comes together through strong acting from top to bottom.  Between Brie Larson's powerhouse performances in this film and in \"Room,\" she has established herself as the next big Hollywood actress.  She possesses the ability to harness the raw emotions from deep in her soul and portray them through her characters.  The real surprise is 16-year-old Kaitlyn Dever as the passive aggressive character Jayden.  Her spectrum of emotions ranges from subtle sarcastic facial expressions to a total mental breakdown.  The rap by Marcus (played by Keith Stanfield) is completely heartbreaking.  All of the residents of the facility perform beyond their years, and the cast is rounded out by John Gallagher, Jr. as the balance between normal and disturbed.  \"Short Term 12\" is not the most well-known film but it is a must for fans of \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" \"Girl, Interrupted,\" and any other drama that creates a realistic portrayal of life in an institution.",

Her performance in Short Term 12 might be even better than Room, and I think John Gallagher Jr. manages to pull off the same high quality acting. Actually all the cast is magnificent and that's impressive particularly because of how young some of these actors were at the time. The film is about life in a short-term housing facility for at-risk teenagers. As the movie progresses we see how the staff and residents manage to form bonds that provide healing and growth. It's a tough film to watch at times because the home situations that some of these people came from is bad (to say the least,) and they are dealing with trauma because of that. But then there are other moments where we see the connections they make with one another and it melts my heart and even made me cry more than once. The story isn't shockingly new or unique, there aren't big twists and turns in the plot, and the characters don't surprise you by acting in ways you wouldn't expect. But there was something so heart-warming, authentic, and special about the story that I loved it from start to finish. I'm so glad I caught it while it's free on Netflix streaming because this is a film that I probably wouldn't have sought out otherwise. I highly recommend you track down Short Term 12, because this is a movie that left me with a big smile on my face, and I hope it will do the same for you.",

            "content": "This film is extraordinary. The film basically is about a group of kids who have all got something wrong in their life. Whether it be abusive parents, recent loss, mental issues or anything of the sort. They stay at Short Term 12 until they move on somewhere else. \n\nBut although the story seems like your basic story of this ilk I am telling you it is so much more than that. On the surface, these kids and adults all seem fine but once you start to delve into their lives you realise just how much trouble they have been through. \n\nThere are 3 stand-out characters in my mind. Brie Larson as Grace,  Kaitlyn Dever as Jaden and Keith Stanfield as Marcus. All three of these characters are masterfully portrayed by their acting counterparts and all have different problems. Grace and Jaden meet after Jaden is sent to Short Term 12 after the passing of her mother and immediately hit it off.  Both seem to find common ground in their suffering and the rapport between the two girls is glistening while you watch. There is one scene between the two. After an incident where Jaden strikes out because her Dad didn't pick her up on her birthday the two of them sit in the cool down room. Grace says to Jaden \"All of the problems in the world are impossible to deal with when there is blood coming out of you.\" This essentially sums up the mentality of somebody in a dire situation. Many do not understand how it feels and I do not claim to but from all of the films I have seen dealing with this delicate subject I have never seen it summed up better.\n\nMarcus' character is one that seems easy to read at first. He's the cool kid who has a problem with anybody who doesn't follow his lead but there is a scene where he opens up to one of the staff in a whole new way. He sits in his room and reads out a rap that describes his childhood. It's extremely powerful.\n\nAll in all this film is a masterpiece. I feel sad that it has taken me almost 3 years to watch it and now that I have I sense the way I look at certain situations will change. Not many films give you that kind of reaction when you finish them but this small, hipster film did just that.",

            "content": "There's a moment in Short Term 12, about an hour in, that feels so wildly out of place it will take your breath away. It's a scene out of any number of movies-a slasher flick, a gangster movie, the Jennifer Lopez vehicle Enough-but certainly not this tender-hearted drama about struggling teenagers and the two formerly-struggling teenagers turned barely-keeping-it-together adults who take care of them. And just when you think Short Term 12 has finally fallen off the tightrope it so expertly navigated for that first hour, a well-placed quip and, shortly thereafter, an emotionally devastating revelation bring it back to a place of unequivocal brilliance.\n\nThat's the film in a nutshell. It toes so many lines-it's at times almost too mawkish, frenetic, and under-detailed. But it improbably manages to avoid being any of those things. It is, instead, parts an onion-like character piece and a penetrating coming-of-age drama that manages to sprinkle in just enough beneath-the-pain smiles to make the exercise enjoyable. Simply put, it's a once-in-a-blue-moon movie that's sure to rank among my very favorites this year.\n\nThe film's title refers to the home for at-risk teens that Grace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) work at. Both are great at jobs they love, and both are lucky to have found love on the job. Yes, Grace and Mason are together. It's not a well-kept secret, but they aren't trying to keep it a secret. Grace, however, is keeping a secret from Mason; she's pregnant.\n\nWhile she contemplates having an abortion (it'd be her second) or keeping it, a new girl arrives at Short Term 12. Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) has been in and out of homes like this her whole life; she knows the rules. Grace is taken with this girl almost immediately, and she's able to connect with Jayden in a way no one-including her father-has been able to. But there's a reason she's here, and as things start to go south with Jayden, so they do with Grace. She has some tendencies, and as various pressures in her personal life threaten to boil over, those tendencies begin to show.\n\nOne must start with Larson. Acting this good just doesn't happen very often. It brings to mind Elizabeth Olsen's breakout turn in Martha Marcy May Marlene in 2011, if not substantially than at least in the sense that it should make the young actress a star. Larson, of course, isn't a total stranger. She was the romantic lead in 21 Jump Street. She also popped up in The Spectacular Now and Rampart, but to lead a film as good as Short Term 12 and as well as she does is, well, pretty huge and monumentally impressive.\n\nWhat's great about the performance is what's also great about writer/director Destin Cretton's top-notch screenplay. The film opens with a monologue-one of several laugh-out-loud funny monologues from John Gallagher Jr., who's also terrific in the film-and while it's being told, we see Grace as this put-together good samaritan. Along the way, it's little details-the way she nervously picks her skin, her almost obsessive protectiveness over Jayden-that hint at a dark past. She's not an open person, however, so there's a nagging mystery at the heart of the film. It never suffocates us-character very much comes first in Short Term 12-but we're fed just enough story to remain satisfied throughout.\n\nI really adore Short Term 12 for so many reasons-including its deliberately unpolished look-and it's a little tricky to define why other than to say I've seen films like this many times that fail, moderately or miserably. Not so with Cretton's feature (based on a short he directed in 2008). It's an utterly delightful experience. Its subject matter isn't joyful, but you'll find joy instead in the perfect way it all comes together.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/short-term-12-review/",

Sure, sometimes there is something special about a person and you feel oddly connected to them... but this is a movie.  These types of things need to be explained... or else questions such as mine arise.  I didn't like the overuse of shaky-cam.

It was good to be reminded of good people and the potential of working with teenagers.  Also the negatives of the government being in charge of education and some of the pitfalls were we don't have a community of people who are supporting each other and more of a collection of individuals who do the minimum to keep system afloat. Then there are others who care too much.  Difficult to find that happy medium.  Especially with these super difficult and abhorrent behaviors.  Loved the end.",

            "content": "Sometimes a movie that on the surface may seem small in both scale and scope has much more to say than anyone gave it credit for until they themselves have seen it. Destin Cretton's feature debut Short Term 12 is one of those films whose synopsis does not give it credit for what it broaches in its short 90 minute running time.\n\nComing out of nowhere and striking a chord with audiences the world over Short Term 12 is a fantastically written and observant film that has a lot to say about both disconnected youth and those whose lives have been affected by sometimes unspeakable trauma. Cretton has a deft touch both in his screen writing and in his gritty hand-held filming approach and the two mould together to paint an emotionally driven portrait of those in the \"limbo\" house between broken home and new foster accommodation. There are some striking scenes in the film namely a heartbreaking rap from Marcus (Stanfield) a boy who has clearly experienced much heartbreak or two bookend scenes played out with dialogue chronicling adventures of the homes residents. These moments in the film showcase Cretton as a talent to watch just like the films leading lady Brie Larson.\n\nSmall films like Short Term 12 have been a breeding ground for break out performances for years now, with those looking to break into a tough industry choosing tough roles to show off their wares. Brie Larson here in her role as conflicted and inwardly troubled worker Grace stamps herself as an actress capable of both pure heartrending emotion and an equal talent at comedic timing and lovable charm, no doubt a few tricks were learned from her time in praised TV show The United States of Tara and supporting roles in films such as 21 Jump Street and Don Jon. It's a pleasure to see an actress grow before your eyes as Larson does and she is ably supported by an impressive adult cast and a cast of young adults that are led by Justified's impressive young actress Kaitlyn Dever.\n\nShort Term 12 is as stated a small film that deals with big issues and deals with them in a way that is both confronting yet in a manner that seems just right. It's a film brimming with heart and personality and a film that could stand equal to many more high profile films of last year. I personally can't wait to see where both Larson and Cretton go to next.\n\n4 hated inflatable dogs out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

            "content": "This is a great example of the modern American independent film at its best: telling straightforward, emotionally affecting stories about the sorts of people big studio movies would never think to make a movie about. It doesn't have any major stars (though Brie Larson seems on her way to becoming one) or anything technically remarkable about it, but it's got everything it needs to be powerfully moving.\n\nThe story follows Grace (Larson), a young woman who works at a short-term care home for at-risk teenagers. She's a humble and compassionate presence to her young charges, but we slowly learn that she's got some serious damage of her own. In following her story, the movie also provides significant glimpses into the life of her boyfriend, who also works at the home, and several of the kids she takes care of. There are other movies out there in which a teacher or social worker tries to help troubled youths (the gratingly fake Half Nelson and the overblown and ridiculous Precious come to mind), but few if any of them feel as honest and real as this one. There isn't that much more than that to say, really. This is a great movie in a very simple and straightforward way. It's genuinely compassionate for its characters' problems and doesn't provide easy or fake solutions. And the excellent closing scene illustrates very clearly how life just goes on. I strongly recommend it.",

Brie Larson as the most ambitious employee in this film was great! She was an awesome character, I wanted to go through the screen and give her a hug. I pretty much wanted to do that with all the main characters because they are really likable compassionate people! The characters have great chemistry together and it really shines in this movie. The film mainly shows the troubled pasts of Marcus and Jaden and they were really likable too. Their backstories were very sad and got the tears jerking. This is a very sad movie but that really works with the chemistry between Jaden and Grace because of how much they had in common. Their relationship was so good and interesting to watch. The whole baby situation and starting a family was a bit overused for the movie but nevertheless I enjoyed that too. This is a movie that I believe the world needs. I learned stuff from this movie that in my opinion is essential to know in life and to keep in mind. Short Term 12 is full of heart, tragedy, tears, great characters and a great story. A-",

They don't necessarily have to be about something that I personally identify with, but they do such an effective job at pulling me into their world and their characters and their trials that I feel like, just by watching, I'm toeing emotional eggshells.  Short Term 12 is one of those films.\n\nThe movie focuses on a group of people who supervise a home for foster kids who are considered \"at-risk\".  The film opens with the workers on a break of sorts, chatting it up and enjoying themselves.  It's funny, but it's also a great way to acclimate the audience with these very real people who have a hell of a job.  The head of this group, Grace, is played to perfection by the charismatic Brie Larson.  She hammed it up for cameras as Envy Adams in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, but here you'll find a much more real persona.  People talk of a lack of heroines in films and while I know they're mostly referring to those of the action variety, Grace is inspiring in a very different capacity.  She's struggling to deal with her own shoddy past and how that's fucked up her life, all while helping teenagers try to deal with their own shit.\n\nIf the movie sounds like it deals with some serious subject matter, that's because it does.  Don't let that scare you away though because thankfully the film knows when to lighten the tone so the whole ordeal doesn't go \"Requiem for a Dream\" on ya.  A large source of the amusement comes from supporting character Mason, Grace's love interest.  He also works with the troubled teens and actor John Gallagher Jr. keeps Mason from becoming a caricature.  He's a funny guy, but the kind that's real-world.  You wouldn't mind sitting down and having a drink with the man.  And then there's the kids themselves, and each one walks and talks with an aura of authenticity.  There's not a scene or a moment you'll question.\n\nAs you can see, I've talked mostly about the characters of this story.  The plot threads weave themselves in and out of this foster care program, but what you'll remember is the characters these people portray.  Life can be hard, especially for a teenager.  When they don't have a family who can help guide them, these people in foster care programs are more than just names and faces; they ARE family.  This film has a lot of heart and it often hurts but I'm happy to say that I found a very uplifting message come the film's close.",

We count on each other yet sometimes we tend to hurt the ones we love most. We, human, are weak but if we ever let it, just as David Bowie sang, we can be heroes... just for one day.",

The prime difference between the two films is that both are caring for two different aspects of a person's life; The Class on education and wisdom, while Short Term 12 on emotional and physical trauma. The Class swept me away due to its empathetic and sympathetic protagonist and featuring problems that were a genuine reflection of our own classrooms. Short Term 12 certainly hits the mark in delivering effective and authentic drama, but it didn't \"move\" me as much when watching it.\n\nThe film does not feature a core complication for the audience to dwell on, therefore it does not establish any sort of measurable goal. Instead, Short Term 12 is a character-study, under the facade of a documentary style, as it simply follows the life Grace and exploring the relationships that she is trying to maintain within and outside the residential facility. The film allows us to see the connections she has with her profession and how that and her personal history build and shape her relationships. Grace displays a sense of empathy towards the young residents, as a way to make them feel comfortable; her aim is to build a shield for them, so they won't have to suffer from the evil that lurks outside. Though she acts as a mentor to these people, she herself is not as composed and balanced as she displays herself to be; there are some demons that are feeding from her soul, and with each problem that surface, it becomes harder and harder for her to survive in her profession, especially in an emotional level.\n\nThe film's camera-work utilises a hand-held approach in order to achieve that intimate documentary feel that Destin Daniel Cretton, the director, requires to tell this story. It creates this feeling, like as if the audience was a spectating caretaker herself, following and monitoring Grace; similar to what she and her co-workers does when a person escapes from their facility.\n\nShort Term 12 wouldn't have been the emotional and intimate ride that it is, if it weren't for Brie Larson's performance. Larson was able to meet the demands that were needed in making this role come off as sophisticated and most importantly, real. Her role is the type that would normally cry out to its audience for sympathy, but she does not force it down our throats; the timing and tone that she delivers her dialogue makes her character's own personal story feel natural and convincing.\n\nShort Term 12 is drama at its purest form. The film did not require screaming matches or physical confrontation to create tension and it showcases a marvellous performance from Brie Larson. If this does not lead her to more varied and sophisticated roles, then cinema and its audience are missing out on a wonderful thing.",

At the crux of the film is Grace (Larson) who leads the facility's workers and helps kids while also dealing with her own life. It's really quite sweet that Grace and her boyfriend Mason (Gallagher) have fragmented childhoods, and so they have to (rather than want to) help ease the pain of these children and the problems they face. In comparison is a college worker who would like to help, but doesn't know where to start. The performances from the child actors in this film are nothing short of astounding. Brie Larson commands complete presence onscreen, as Grace, a multi-faceted basket case who is always trying to do better, but inevitably has to fight her demons. This is a really sweet, funny, heartfelt film dealing with big issues in a sensitive and thoughtful way, which makes it highly recommendable.",

The film stars the talented Brie Larson as Grace, the manager of a temporary fostering home for abandoned adolescents. When the conflicted teen Jayden checks into the home, it brings back Grace's dark past as a teen. There was a lot of goodness gracious in Larson's astounding performance as Grace. John Gallagher Jr. was also impressive as Mason, Grace's boyfriend and co- manager of the center. Writer-Director Destin Daniel Cretton deserves much Cretton credit for his impressive little film that will touch your heartstrings.

And you should see it.\nShort Term 12 is about a Foster Care center for Trouble Kids, and Grace (Brie Larson) along with his boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jr) love their job of running the place. As the movie flows through our veins, we discover more about these characters, and oh god, Short Term 12 is really that good.\nIt has lots of humour, to begin with. It sort of plays with the fact that this teens have trouble and that leaves us some quirky moments. It's impossible not to smile as every positive moment is so heartwarming. This movie really gets the feels, and in both ways, as it is also heartwrenching. Of course it is expected. It is a film that is not shy of showing how messed up some of this kids are. The emotional payoff is sensational, and thanks to amazing performances, the film is an A+ Superior Tearjerker.\nBrie Larson is magnetic. Every presence is a scene stealer. She is really coming to herself as a great actress and the heart and soul of this film. Destin Cretton has crafted a film so amazing that it is a contemporary masterpiece. On demand, on Hulu or wherever you find it, go watch Short Term 12, and tell other people to watch it. It is a necessary, but also thoroughly enjoyable little gem that is full of energy and punch.",

Anyway, here we go.\n\nTo give some context, I worked as a Child and Youth Worker for over four years in group and foster care homes. Therefore, when I watched this, I watched it from the perspective of a worker rather than just a viewer being captivated at the great story here of the children's realities, but also the worker's realities as well. As there is some obvious sensationalism for the sake of the movie in terms of Brie Larson's character, the movie is scaringly accurate to what life is like as a worker within group homes. \n\nDown to the first scene, it was clear that the writer of the movie knew what he was talking about. I can't tell you how many times those situations happened. The realism of the charts on the walls, binders of client files, and just the overall look of the home screamed authenticity. It was really hard for me to watch at times because as a former front-line worker, seeing restraints within the film brought out some traumatic events of my own as a CYW. \n\nBeing spit on, kicked, punched, bitten, almost having your eyes gouged out, etc. These are just some of the circumstances that workers face when working with at-risk children and youth. However, what most people don't know is the sheer lack of respect worker's get, and the severe lack of funding/pay worker's receive. Worker's are over-worked (I would sometimes work 24 hour long shifts with no breaks), underpaid, and undervalued. However, we press on for those kids. That's what matters. Those kids. They drive you, and even when they're having the worst day in their lives, it's the silly joke or face that brings them back down and makes them feel safe again.\n\nThank you, Destin Cretton and the cast and crew. Hopefully, this movie will gain the eye of the majority and people will recognize how difficult but rewarding this job really is.",

It is through Grace that we see the tragedy of the youth's lives, the anger, depression, confusion, and yet the hope that still abounds. It's a film of sadness, but also of love.\n\nToo many films along similar lines have resorted to clich√©s or forced storylines to tell their story. This is not true of Short Term 12, which has an emotional intensity that is rare, and does this without melodrama. The characters in this film are treated with respect, not idealized or pitied, rather they are shown as what they are, we see the different coping mechanisms employed, while also understanding the underlining issues at hand. The family dynamics, and the dynamics amongst the youth feel real and organic to the story. The script is both finely written and poignant, delivering us a snap shot in a world that is hard to really face, but one that rings true.\n\nThe film is populated with fantastic performance, headlined by Brie Larson, in a role that should certainly serve as a launching point for her career. The direction, the pacing, the script, all are pitch perfect in a film that unfolds within itself without the use of gimmicks or plot devices. It's a methodical burn without being slow, subtle without holding back.\n\nA must see. \n\n\n4.5/5 Stars",

            "content": "A poster for Short Term 12 shows Grace (Brie Larson) chasing after a scrawny preteen, draped in an American flag, across a yard. This yard is in the foster child complex where Grace is employed beside her long-term boyfriend. Her specific unit, the titular \"Short Term 12,\" houses a spectrum of children ranging from around 8 to 17 years, 364 days. In a thankless profession, Grace struggles with her complex role as part housekeeper, administrator, mentor, babysitter, and occasionally warden. However, Grace's real trials aren't limited to her professional life; she is understandably overwhelmed by a multitude of other issues, including her increasingly complex bond with her boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) and a prison release with excruciating emotional effects on her mood and her relationships. As with any job, her personal challenges have significant effect on her work duties, for better or worse. \n\nAs wonderfully crafted of a script as this was, writer (and director) Destin Cretton owes an incredible debt to lead Brie Larson. I saw Larson earlier this year in The Spectacular Now where she played a small but significant role. In that role, she easily kept up with the fantastic performances of Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley, who have the ability to act anyone off the screen. Here, she owns the leading role, forming a formidable onscreen partnership with John Gallagher Jr. who counters her occasionally introverted nature with a goofy and charming performance not unlike his role in HBO's The Newsroom. \n\nThe script, however, is not to be overlooked. Originally a short also written by Cretton, the dialogue and progression of the relationships were organic and unhurried, an unfortunately rare trait in many movies in the genre which usually put tear-jerking ahead of a script which attempts to mirror reality. Short Term 12 partially focuses on the uneasy bond between a new foster child Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) and Grace, and while the parallels between these two are certainly no surprise, they're presented smartly and with a sense of purpose, rather than just looking to draw a reaction from the audience.\n\nThere were a few elements of Short Term 12 which were perhaps a bit fatigued. The score, while initially spunky and different, became quite tired by the end of the film, having what seemed like limited variety to really accentuate emotions as the story progressed. The visual palate was similarly limited, perhaps accurately reflecting the dry, hot Los Angeles setting, but really never seemed utilized to its full potential (especially considering the phenomenal editing and camera work; every scene was deliberate and resonate). \n\nShort Term 12 is a gut-wrenching film, not necessarily sad and certainly not downbeat, but rather overwhelming emotional. Certainly we can identify with Grace's struggles; overworked, underappreciated, balancing life at home with professional duties. The way in which Grace and her coworkers relate to their young residents is thought-provoking and even inspiring. Cretton presents to us a role in society which could have easily been exploited for tears, and he instead challenges us to question the motives and choices Grace, Mason, their boss, and even the kids who reside in Short Term 12.\n\nRead more reviews at RJGFilmAnalysis.com",

It's very inspiring that a film this low budget can be a better work of cinematic art than the huge budget productions (just compare this to the boring pastiche of Hunger Games 2, which for me is Agatha Christie's And Then There None mixed with Condon's A Most Dangerous Game and TV's Survivor show -- over fifty year old concepts rehashed with nothing new but the setting and the production expense)",

Some heartbreaking, well acted scenes, especially by Brie Larson. It got that typical indie-look - it screams \"Sundance\" - it's written all over it. In a very good way that is.\n\nSubtle, still deep and important\nthis is a film about people, people with heavy personal issues. I like people, also the ones with issues.

It is the story of a short term foster care facility for at risk teenagers, and deals mainly with one of the on floor supervisors named Grace. At first Grace seems to have everything well in hand, she is incredible at her job, interesting as a person and very easy to root for. Grace's life starts to get turned upside down when a string of occurrences, including the intake of a young troubled teen girl that reminds her of herself, begins to unravel feelings that she has been ignoring for years. The acting in Short Term 12 is completely incredible, every character from the small back ground roles to the main players are all completely believable, so much so that it sometimes feels like it could be a documentary. Saying that, this film is not going to fit everyone's tastes, there are no explosions or chase scenes, well, actually there are a few chase scenes, but not like anything you would see in a Hollywood movie. What Short Term 12 does have is heart, mounds and mounds of pure film lovers heart. So much so that when the last words were spoken and the credits rolled, all I could say to myself was, \"WOW!\" So do yourself a favor, give this small movie a chance, it may do you some good, or at least, make you appreciate what you have or had as a teenager.\n5 Beards Out Of 5",

It is the story of a short term foster care facility for at risk teenagers, and deals mainly with one of the on floor supervisors named Grace. At first Grace seems to have everything well in hand, she is incredible at her job, interesting as a person and very easy to root for. Grace's life starts to get turned upside down when a string of occurrences, including the intake of a young troubled teen girl that reminds her of herself, begins to unravel feelings that she has been ignoring for years. The acting in Short Term 12 is completely incredible, every character from the small back ground roles to the main players are all completely believable, so much so that it sometimes feels like it could be a documentary. Saying that, this film is not going to fit everyone's tastes, there are no explosions or chase scenes, well, actually there are a few chase scenes, but not like anything you would see in a Hollywood movie. What Short Term 12 does have is heart, mounds and mounds of pure film lovers heart. So much so that when the last words were spoken and the credits rolled, all I could say to myself was, \"WOW!\" So do yourself a favor, give this small movie a chance, it may do you some good, or at least, make you appreciate what you have or had as a teenager.",

            "content": "This movie is a brilliant example of what a 'Dramedy' should be. It knows exactly when to be funny and when to tackle more serious issues. Short Term 12 takes place at a home for at-risk teens. Supervised by four people, probably in their mid-30's, who find the balance between being cool and authoritative. The newcomer, Nate, has to ease into the sometimes wild and vicious fits that only afflicted humanity can muster. When Mason (John Gallagher Jr) begins the film telling a funny story about when he defecated his pants on a bus, Pete laughs, but later in the movie when it is revealed that the bully who picked on him killed himself and was found in a bush, he is taken aback. \"Yea. I don't like that part,\" Mason replies. The standout performance, of this film and of her young career, is Brie Larson. She is at the center of this home, and the center of the story. Having gone through a lot of what the kids are suffering through when she was a girl, Brie Larson's character Grace is able to level with the more afflicted teens who are shocked to find out that they're not alone. Grace is compassionate for these kids and desperately wants them to do well. When one of the girls is released back to her father who Grace believes is sexually abusive, she blows up on her boss and loses her job. These kids mean a lot to her and its a way for her to deal with her own pain, but when questions of the future begin to be raised concerning her loving boyfriend, Mason, she is conflicted. This film is a masterpiece of character, mood, and writing. The world of the at-risk home, even the term \"at-risk home,\" is an interesting hodgepodge family dynamic that is worth investigating. Here our authoritative figures, who are not quite parents, and here are their kids who are not quite their kids. Everyone knows that this place is only a short term thing, and plus, that they are afflicted, so everyone is free to be themselves and in a way, act out their wild raging impulses with the safe, judge-free environment. It really is a spectacular situation if you think about. I'll end with this. The ending of this movie is pure gold. I hope it get's the sort of attention and appreciation it deserves. It is the perfect metaphor for the message and tone of the movie. And I dare say that there is something uniquely American about it.",

            "content": "Wow. Wow. Wow. The credits begin to roll after Short Term 12 ends, and these are the primary thoughts racing through my head after experiencing such an emotionally dense film. Despite its simplistic storyline, Short Term 12 is nothing short of extraordinary, because it forces us to experience the full spectrum of human emotions as the film progresses-quick-witted humor, sorrow, apathy, and ultimately, the existential significance of the decisions we make as we grow as emotional human beings. Short Term 12, without a doubt, stands out as one of the greatest and most impactful indie films of 2013, and it deserves much acclamation for its gorgeous cinematography, deeply moving plot, and realistically humane style.\n\nShort Term 12 follows Grace, our kind-hearted yet troubled protagonist working at a foster-care home for underprivileged and troubled children, named-you guessed it-Short Term 12. Grace is the best at what she does-connecting with children living in the home and helping them through their social and emotional issues. She lives with her boyfriend Mason, and early into the film, Grace receives the news that she is pregnant. This unplanned pregnancy-along with various anxiety and familial issues-are all demons Grace must battle internally to remain strong and effective as a caretaker at the facility. Shortly thereafter, Short Term 12 receives a new intake named Jayden, a darkly dressed and bad-mannered teenage girl. Grace learns to connect quite well with Jayden, along with other members of the home, due to her similarly painful past.\n\nThe beauty of Short Term 12 lies in its striking realism, immersive character development, and engagingly symbolic cinematography. Every character has their moment to shine as we notice their individualistic mannerisms and the seemingly unimportant objects they pay attention to, each with its own emotionally dense backstory per respective character. Not a single scene is wasted in Short Term 12, relying on single-shot frames of scenery, events, and facial expressions as symbolic representations of the story being told. The film is both light-hearted and powerfully somber, injected with quick-witted humor the entire way through while slowly inching its way into your heart. \n\nThroughout its entertaining playfulness, Short Term 12 also forces you to face the dark realities of life, such as the children that suffer in neglected or abusive homes and its psychological consequences. This film is truly an accomplishment for indie cinema, because few films can be so amusingly clever and boldly genuine. At one point in the film, Mason is retelling one of his favorite stories and states, \"It was so f**king cute, I almost pissed my pants.\" The same can be said about Short Term 12, because it is a film that is simply impossible not to adore.",

What a shame, for \"Short Term 12\" was this quiet engagement that I couldn't peel my eyes away from, and was thus left speechless when it ended. It had such raw emotions and powerful dialogue that I was knocked off my stool and brought to tears. Brie Larson, whom I'm only starting to realize has played varied roles such as in \"Community\" and \"21 Jump Street,\" is brilliant as the youth worker who tries her best to reach out to troubled teens while dealing with her own dark history. Intimate and grounded, \"Short Term 12\" is definitely not a short-term film for me. It's a late addition to my favourite films of 2013 and it's staying there in the long-run.",

That's not to say that there isn't enough of it already here amid the fractured and fragile characters found in Short Term 12. Cretton delicately infuses the unrealised potential for far-reaching hopelessness here with a wholly welcoming delicate air of warmth and sensitivity.\n\nLeading the charge here is the fabulous Larson as Grace. Her stoic presence within such a potentially volatile environment is all the more remarkable when her outwardly simple life beyond the walls of the foster system she works in slowly starts to fracture. It's a subtle splintering that never, ever once lends itself to unnecessary overwrought dramatic irrationality. Through Cretton's screenplay, Larson gives Grace a vulnerable strength that centres the film and provides a stunning balance between her personal demons and the unwavering commitment she has towards her charges.\n\nCredit to Cretton's wonderful direction and screenplay in that as devastating as Short Term 12 could possibly be, the movie all the more stronger for holding back on some aspects of the characters lives. His focus on positive dialogue and creating a safe environment for his audience with a beautifully shot film never makes this anything less compelling than it is.\n\nShort Term 12 is a spectacular achievement in subtle intensity, and an exemplary example of beautifully affecting dramatic filmmaking. Combined with powerful, poignant, even courageous, performances across the board from such a capable young cast, the result is a surprising, significant film experience that's more than worth your time.",

It has got drama and for sure, it's got shitload of drama but the director has put in several tid-bits. It is well-infused with action and humour but not so much so as to over-shadow the main theme, which itself is intriguing but well-defined.\nThe director should be commended for his portrayal of grave topic which subtly stood out despite the strong acting. The characters do a very well job in providing just an optic, a keyhole to look and understand the base of the movie, shying away from providing any well-defined angle to understand this movie. Scenes seeming irrelevant at first fit in almost perfectly. Almost. \nTo encapsulate the above 2 paragraphs, this movie is transparent.\nThe first 20 seconds leave you curious but the last 20 seconds just makes you wish that the movie shouldn't end here. However the director and the actors leave you pretty satisfied in the end.\nIt is not a movie that you might watch during lunch but it is that 4 o'clock movie, when you have nothing else to do but you want your mind to be occupied.  It depicts the truth of the 'neglected youth' who are being taken care by 'neglected youth'. A movie that I deem must-watch\n\nAnd at the end of my first critique, I understand why some critics never make sense and use jumbled formations to say something that is as easy as 'Go, watch this goddamn movie' It probably makes sense just to the one who writes it..",

Though it was well shot and acted, the story has no focus and falls victim to the usual Hollywood cliche's about troubled kids...except this one adds more cliches about the people who work with them, too.  It's probably my direct experience with the subject matter that threw me off (15 years working with troubled kids), I was expecting a more realistic film.  Though the depiction of a few of the kids is pretty realistic, that's where it ends.  I keep hoping that one day a movie will actually get it right, but I guess I'll have to keep hoping.  Regardless of its inaccuracies, it's still an emotional film and effective on that level, even if the end is too sweet for the subject matter.  I just wish the filmmakers had done a little more research into what these kids are really like, and as well as the people who work with them and the child welfare system as a whole.  There is only ONE negative review on Rotten Tomatoes, and it is \"Well intentioned, but somehow inauthentic.\"  I could not agree more.",

Writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton composes a movie that deals with how victims become victors. With a fantastic cast and a wonderful eye for drama and character, Cretton brings the audience into the world of people who work with at-risk teens, and the personal struggles they deal with.\n\nBut what Cretton does so well is making Short Term 12 more personal than I expected. In the hands of his lead actress, Cretton's story of a young woman exorcising her demons through her work with at-risk teens who have had similar struggles as her, becomes just as much about her triumph as the kids she's helping. Larson is so charismatic and sympathetic that even though she's so weathered from her tenure at Short Term 12 we still can see the passion in her eyes for what she's doing.\n\nWith the help of a supporting cast, Larson and Cretton bring such powerful emotion to bear on the story that you can't help but be drawn in. In both the dramatic and the sweeter character moments you'll find yourself invested in the emotions these performers are portraying. But Larson is the key here. Her performance is so subtle that she seems like a real person. We often forget she's acting, because she's portraying so many motivations and emotions at the same time.\n\nIt's a film that deals with complex emotions and storylines in a very simple way: heart. The film has a lot of heart, and it's clear everyone involved was passionate about the story being told. It's a definite must watch.",

It makes you believe it will fall into a simple \"girl helps all\" cliche, but turns itself onto another cliche regarding the \"girl has issues of her own\".  It's not necessarily a bad thing, just not solidifying it as a story piece and more about the characters (a la David O Russell).  The supporting cast is fine, providing moments of comedic touch, in an otherwise dark tale about abuse and power.\n\nThe camera work is a bit hectic, to symbolize the film's overall spastic nature to shift between tone so unevenly (totally it works, just the shakes cam has been done to death and is annoying).  It's not 99% good, but it's a satisfying movie to see raw emotions play out even if not every character is fully fleshed out (I'm looking at you Rosa!)",

            "content": "Cretton's second feature film is a slightly idealized, naturalistic look into troubled humans, specifically teens and then their evolved states,  the only slightly more stable 20 somethings.\n\nLike most films that labor to have the story action fit into a pre-defined dramatic mold, liberties are taken.  Despite complications, there is a large amount of success shown in a very short period of time.  Otherwise, it would have been a bummer overall, which probably wasn't the director's goal.  I wouldn't say that it's any worse than your standard drama, but as far as cons go for this film, that's probably the main one.  Other than that factor, the film's reality isn't that heightened, it's mostly our world.  \n\nAnother comment I have, though less on the piece itself and more about my thoughts on the matter of kindness, is that this story doesn't depict people performing far beyond the standard empathic forcing function of helping another version of themselves.  The protagonists aren't really branching out and helping people that they don't immediately relate to.  I would tend to say that in universal social situations, reaching out beyond your realm is the more impressive action.  However, for the tightness of this story and the poignance of the fact that we aren't nearly as alone as we sometimes feel, it's a boon.  Are they agents of selfish compassion?  Perhaps, but I'll take it, it's leagues better than nothing.\n\nIf this film has one strength, it's naturalism.  The premise and dialog of these compassionate people using the fiber of their past as fuel to help the next generation is presented with full believability.  Brie Larson is apparently a chameleon because her earthbound performance here bears no resemblance to Envy Adams!  She displays a full range of emotions and states, with impressively limited histrionicity.  I'm happy to report that she has a bit of range, not unlike Jessica Chastain.  Keith Stanfield is also impressive as the dynamic youth Marcus.  \n\nThe film is also more visceral than I was expecting, underscoring how a restrained depiction of realistic circumstance often has more power than the most outrageous of blockbuster situations.  The tone of the film almost reminds me of a documentary or PTA's \"Magnolia,\" for some reason.  I suppose the degree of naturalism this film contains is somewhere between the sobriety of a documentary and the near surrealism of the latter.  Accolades-wise it was probably overlooked because it's centered on young people with the most significant characters maxing out in their 20s.\n\nWhile a bit too small to really stand out as a great film to me, \"Short Term 12\" is a very effective portrait of \"troubled\" edge city young people at different stages in their lives.

            "content": "Short Term 12?\n\nMore like Short Term FAIL.\n\nThere rarely comes a time when a film this highly praised is one I would unashamedly consider straight-up bad. There are many films that get equal amount of praise, that I personally may not like, but be able to watch objectively and at least understand why it has been so praised. Why someone would love it so much. But with Short Term 12?\n\nNo, it is bad. It is just not a good movie.\n\nI can sum up its problems very swiftly, wrapped in a single sentence or two, but I would much rather go into some detail of it. And no, I am not going to give you that short run-down. I would much rather you read some of the details.\n\nLet us first discuss the foster-care facility in which the majority of this film takes place.\n\nWe see, maybe, ten to fifteen teens here. There might be more, there might be less. Does not matter. Either way will prove my point. But for the sake of the initial argument, allow me to say there is roughly ten to fifteen teenagers. \n\nCool. Ten to fifteen teenagers in this facility? Not bad! This is good! The more the merrier, right?\n\nWell, guess what.\n\nThere is only four employees.\n\nAnd their boss who does not have much to do with anything regarding this place other than granting teenagers in and out.\n\nSo, allow me to bash some of these characters, okay? Which falls under under the facility, so I will be bashing that too. And this is also all bashing Short Term 12's writing. Okay?\n\nThanks.\n\nLEZ TALK BOUT GRACE\n\nThe Rotten Tomatoes consensus says \"Short Term 12 is an empathetic, revealing drama that pulls audiences into the perspective of neglected youths.\"\n\nThis is one of the most misleading consensuses I have ever read. I could break down each part of that sentence, exposing how flat-out wrong it is. But let me start with the last part, \"pulling audiences into the perspective of neglected youths\".\n\nWe only ever get involved with, in one way or another, with three of the teens staying at the facility. Two of each are not actually neglected. Marcus's mother beats him. Jayden's father abuses her. That is the opposite of neglection.\n\nHowever, the third teen (who we see three or five times, never having more than ten seconds of screen time), is one we can easily assume is neglected. Because it is stated in one scene that his therapist had just taken away his dolls or toys or whatever, which are said to be his only friends.\n\nAnyway, this film is not, by no means, told from the perspective of any of these teenagers individually or collectively. Instead, this film is told by Grace's perspective, our main character, one of the facility's employees. Which is AOK! I like this element! I am just pointing out the misunderstanding that is in Rotten Tomatoes' consensus.\n\nNow, Grace has been here for a while. We can infer, from a story told by Mason, that it has been at least three years. At least. But even without that, we know she is nowhere near new because she knows all the teenager's names, knows them inside and out, she leads all the meetings and programs all the activities. Et cetera.\n\nSome of the employee requirements to a job like this, I would assume, is to have a testimony. To have had a history of depressive and / or suicidal behavior. It is truly the only way you can have a real in with the teens. To be more than able to help and understand them. But, obviously, of course, you have to have been cleared as mentally stable yourself and whatnot prior to hiring. Which I am not sure how thorough this facility was with that process.\n\nGrace begins to lose it when she finds out Jayden, who had been giving some pretty symbolic yet blunt signs of an abusive father, is granted to go back home. To her abusive father. So she storms into her boss's office, Frank, to yell at him. And she certainly does. Calling him out as well. Some insults here and there. All of this is understandable. To a degree. But it is taken to a whole new level when she grabs his desk lamp and runs out back to smash it against the pavement. Shattering completely. \n\n1) Would she really do this? It is actually so forced and so unrealistic.\n\n2) Could this really be the first time this has happened? She acts as if it is. And you would think, since she has been there for three or more years, this is not the first time a teenager was taken back to the very home in which they are abused / neglected.\n\n3) How is she not fired or suspended for snatching her boss's desk lamp and smashing it to pieces? Not only for the crime of damaging someone's personal property, but because she is making a solid case against her mental stability. I mean, as Bill Engvall would say, \"There's your sign!\" \n\nI mean, the guy actually had some valid points. Jayden never outright said she was abused let alone abused by her father with whom she still lives with. Although that is not to say Grace is wrong either. She is most definitely right, but still. Solid evidence is nothing less than essential.\n\nLater, Grace goes all the way out to Jayden's house. Predictably to seek revenge. Which we know is not close by. Jayden ran away once from the facility and Grace followed her. It started from the afternoon and they did not get there until a while after it was dark.\n\nBut anyway, Grace goes all the way out there enraged.\n\nBreaks into the garage. Carefully scavenging for a weapon. And she settles on a baseball bat. She then proceeds into the house, looking for Jayden's father, so she can bash his brains out senselessly. \n\nIs this sounding realistic to you? Does this sound like something a foster-face facility employee would do? Especially one that has been cleared mentally stable? Sure, we all snap. We are not perfect. But how many of us, previous depressed / suicidal or not, would actually go to this length? This is just dumb.\n\nThen they go outside and beat up his car instead of his skull ... where the luxury car's alarm refuses to go off and nobody in the neighborhood can hear the sound of shattering glass for a good two minutes. Not even the neighbors.\n\nHave I made my point about Grace? \n\nShe is a poorly and unrealistically written character.\n\nMASON!!!!!!\n\nNow, Mason, although not indisputable like Grace, is also a terribly written character. Having said that, he is the best written character of Short Term 12. \n\nThere is one scene that really stands out to support this claim.\n\nOf him being poorly and unrealistically written, that is.\n\nIt is when Grace exits the hospital after waiting so long to hear about Marcus's condition and Mason goes after her. She is clearly upset, and it is clearly that there is more going on, so Mason pressures her (reasonably) to tell him what is happening with her. They are a long-term couple, yet Grace has trust issues. And somehow, Mason does not understand why. Needless to say, Grace cannot even explain it to him. Hence the trust issues.\n\nIt blows my mind away, that after all these years, Mason does not have a single clue to what is wrong. And I will tell you, readers.\n\nAnd Mason. If you're reading this.\n\nIt. Is. All. Be. Cause. Of. Her. Fath. Er.\n\nAt least three times in the film it is stated that her father is in prison. And has been for quite some time. We are told by Grace herself it has been over ten years. Thankfully, it is not said why he is in jail. What he did. But it has definitely put a toll on Grace. We can see her carrying it.\n\nDid he do something to her or her mother to go to prison? Maybe it is nothing related to abuse of any kind, maybe it is something else completely. Like tax evasion or something. But because he has been gone for ten plus years, missing the most important time in his kid's life, that has messed her up some. A father's absence can have an enormous effect on a child / kid / teenager.\n\nThough I am still willing to bet my money that his imprisonment is due to domestic abuse of sorts.\n\nSince, you know, Mason and Grace are a long-term couple, not to mention even longer friends, you could certainly presume Mason knows about her imprisoned father. And of course, he does. But how do we know this? Well, there is a scene when he answers the phone. When he hangs up, he tells her that it was her father's parole officer on the phone saying that her father is going to be released in a month.\n\nMason, seriously. How have you not realized this? The absence / abuse of her father has caused her to develop trust issues. This is not rocket science. I would think, since you yourself have had a troubled history, and that you have been working with troubled kids for over three years as well, that you could have figured this out ages ago and have talked to her about it already. But I guess you really are a poorly and unrealistically written character in this poorly and unrealistically written film.\n\nOMG TIME 4 NATE OMG NATE\n\nNate just might be the stupidest, most incompetent and pointless character of all-time. And further proves the incompetence of this foster-care facility in which the majority of this film takes place.\n\nFirst of all, he calls the teenagers \"underprivileged\" to their faces. Yeah, I know, he did not mean to offend them, but how stupid are you? Why would you call anyone underprivileged and to their faces? Even if they were somehow underprivileged? \n\nHe lacks any confidence whatsoever. Is awkward as awkward gets and has no idea what he is doing at any given time. He just does everything wrong. Nor does he seem to have any level of understanding regarding not only teenagers, but troubled teenagers. It seems as if he has had zero experience. With anything.\n\nWas this foster-care facility so desperate that they hired the first person they saw?\n\nAre there no requirements at all?\n\nAgain, further proving this place is utterly incompetent. \n\n(I am going to keep using that word)\n\nPlus the dude is just a dreadful actor. Which only makes watching this character so much worse.\n\nJAYDEN LUIS & MARCUS\n\nNow I am going to touch on a different aspect of how awful the writing of this film is. And it starts with these three teens.\n\nSo Jayden is a white girl, right? Nothing wrong with that.\n\nLuis is a Hispanic boy, right? Nothing wrong with that.\n\nAnd Marcus is black, right? Nothing wrong with that.\n\nBecause Jayden is a white girl (who's depressed / suicidal), that means she has to have her headphones all the time and completely fill up journals with whacky drawings, right?\n\nWell ... no.\n\nBut does she?\n\nYou betcha!\n\nBecause Luis is a Hispanic boy, that means he has to be all cocky and trash talk constantly (which includes yo' momma jokes), right?\n\nWell ... no.\n\nBut does he?\n\nOf course!\n\nBecause Marcus is black, that means he has to write rap lyrics all the time (especially about his mother), right?\n\nWell ... no.\n\nBut does he?\n\nDuh!\n\nThese teenagers are so stereotypically written. I am still waiting for the day when kids and teenagers are not stereotypically written. I think the closest I have seen this to happening is Michel Gondry's The We And The I.\n\nAlso, let me point out how Jayden dresses.\n\nAll black with complements of purple and sometimes red. Because, you know, all at-risk people wear black and purple / red with 4000 wristbands of the same color scheme. Oh, cannot forget the tight jeans either.\n\nAnd another thing, her drawers are loaded with journals that are packed with obscure drawings of all kinds. With thick crayon, marker, you name it. Mostly in black, purple, and red colors, of course.\n\nThe number one praise this film gets is how authentic it is and it is just everything but authentic.\n\nShort Term 12's writer and director, Destin Cretton, clearly has no understanding of teenagers. Or people. Or facilities. So let me go back to that.\n\nTen to fifteen teenagers. Four employees. And a lazy boss who does nothing, knows nothing. I can tell you right now that there needs to be more employees around. I mean, come on, hire me! I have attempted suicide six times and been a camp counselor twice! I got credentials!!!!!!!!!\n\nSeveral times in the film suggest that four people is not enough. And I do not think this was intentional.\n\nOnce Jayden goes AWOL.\n\nTwice Sammy goes AWOL.\n\nMarcus goes after Luis but instead cuts himself and has to go to the hospital. Nobody saw this happening. Who knows how long Marcus was lying there before Grace showed up. And when Grace did find him, she yelled for help and nobody was around to assist her. Until a few minutes later, who knows how many, the film cuts to the next scene before we can find out.\n\nI have said more than I have needed to but I must say it again, that this place is so stinkin' incompetent. It is ridiculous. I am not kidding you when I say it is mind-blowing how badly this film is written and directed. \n\nThe third aspect in how terribly written it is, outside of character and portrayed stereotypes, is how predictable it is. From start to finish. You can see where every other scene is headed and it just gets exhausting. There are no surprises in this film. But, hypothetically, let me say there are surprises in the film, they are still not surprising. You do not gasp. You do not freak out. It is \"meh\". But again, chances are you will not be surprised in any shape or form.\n\nNow on a technical level, Short Term 12 is mediocre. Better than its writing, but still mediocre. Its cinematography is nothing special. Just your classic \"hay lookit we're a hip indie film\" cinematography.\n\nThe editing does not stand out, neither in a negative or positive way. \n\nSound design did not have to be anything other than it was, so nothing to say there.\n\nScore was fine, I guess. Not worth buying or anything.\n\nThe actors gave their best to fill the void of these pathetically written and developed characters. Except the guy who plays Nate. You could give him the greatest written character on the planet and he will turn it into something worse than a Degrassi character.\n\nHowever, the film had its moments here and there. But there is not enough, nor are they great enough, to be considered a redeeming quality is such a bad bad bad movie.\n\nI would like to give it one mango out of four, but the cast did the best they could and it did have those occasional moments, so I will give it two mangos out of four.\n\nBut don't think that means it's worth seeing. Because it isn't.",

            "content": "Rarely does a film come along that can celebrate life in such a way that fully acknowledges the white and black aspects of life, and turns melancholic grey into something inconceivably blissful, Short Term 12 is that film. Setting the film in a foster care facility was the perfect setting to emancipate this idea for almost every child is filled with blackness which caretaker Brie Larson must help assuage with white security, whilst also dealing with melancholy. Director Destin Cretton beautifully realizes this idea through his long takes and beautiful lighting. Beauty oozes through every frame of Short Term 12 making the film a pleasurable viewing experience. However, it is Cretton's actors that steal the show with the most realistic performances to come out of a motion picture in a great while. Needless to say ever actor is on the top of their game, with special attention paid to Kaitlyn Dever's portrayal as troubled teen Jayden, and Brie Larson's depiction of foster caretaker Grace. Dever brilliantly maintains a relatively low key performance avoiding over the top antics for subtlety, which she delivers intensely through her melancholic expression. Larson's performance as Grace similarly assuages pain through her low key performance for her and Jayden both experienced abuse by their fathers, however, Larson personifies comfort and love through her comforting performance as Grace, certainly delivering one of the best female performances of the year. Perhaps the best aspect of Short Term 12 is the compelling and emotionally moving screenplay by director Destin Cretton. The dialogue is never filled with fluff instead; Cretton always treats every scene in the film as important and urgent. Especially a scene between the characters Grace and Jayden when Jayden tells of a story between a squid and a shark to describe Jayden's abuse between her and her father. Short Term 12 is a brilliant piece of art that is near flawless in every aspect, truly an emotionally compelling masterpiece of cinema.",

After directing his first feature-length film, \"I Am Not a Hipster,\" in 2012, Cretton returned to the previous story with a 96-minute version, which racked up many film festival awards throughout 2013. Had I seen it before last week, I would definitely have included it in my Top 20, if not my Top 10, of the year.

            "content": "The stories behind the at-risk youth in Short Term 12 may be fictional, but there is an element of truth to them that unnervingly reverberates in an all too realistic fashion. Writer-director Destin Cretton spent two years working at a similar facility as seen in the film, helping him craft an environment that feels almost pulled from a documentary at times. The understated brilliance of Short Term 12 is seen through the eyes of those given charge of temporarily watching over these kids, and how perhaps they're not much better off themselves. They may have life slightly more together in the present, but deep down are just as broken and in need of the same things.\n\nBrie Larson is magnificent as our \"heroine,\" the main person in charge of the center who comes with her own set of childhood baggage. Larson excels in the scenes interacting with the kids, and then turns around and is completely heartbreaking when she doesn't take her own advice and plunges her personal life into chaos. It's my first time seeing Larson in a lead role, and it will not be the last because she is destined for greatness.\n\nThe rest of the cast is a proverbial who's who from recent TV shows, and while it's a bit distracting at first, they settle into their roles nicely. John Gallagher Jr. (The Newsroom) especially makes an impact as Larson's boyfriend and shows what he's capable of when actually given strong material. Kaitlyn Dever is terrific in a role similar to her troubled turn on Justified, while Rami Malek (The Pacific) and Stephanie Beatriz (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) make brief appearances as the other staff members.\n\nShort Term 12 might be a little overhyped by critics (it was 2013's highest-rated limited release on Rotten Tomatoes after all), as admittedly some of the melodrama feels a little manufactured (bad things tend to happen in rapid succession). However, to its credit it really nails the group-home dynamics and is a worthwhile film demanding of a wide audience, especially by those who work or have worked with teens. At its core, it speaks to how every person has the same profound aching for love, and it is love that in the end keeps us together. It might sound sappy, but Short Term 12 proves it's for real.",

What makes this film work so well is that it doesn't resort to cliche and doesn't give the audience too much to deal with at one time. It's a tender, often funny, and completely real film. But going back to what truly makes this film great: Larson. Her performance easily goes into the top ten for the year. She is at one moment subtle and the next erratic. Most importantly, because of Larson's pitch perfect performance, the viewer simply cares so deeply for her Grace and, by extension, all of those kids Grace cares for as well.",

It is difficult to find a negative review for it, because it is  a movie which has almost everything - a roller coaster of every emotion, managing to be both heart-warming and heartrending at once. It has some faults, it's not perfect... like life itself!\r\n\r\nThe story is told through the eyes of Grace, a twenty-something supervisor at a foster-care facility for at-risk teenagers. She is passionate and tough, a formidable caretaker of the kids in her charge - and in love with her long-term boyfriend and co-worker, Mason. Grace and Mason work hard, but sometimes struggle to help some of the children... like Marcus, for n example... an intense, quiet kid who is about to turn 18, cope with the difficulty of having to leave the facility. We are let in slowly to discover Grace's own difficult past, added to the surprising future that suddenly presents itself - throwing her into unforeseen confusion. A new arrival, girl called Jayden, a gifted but troubled teenage girl with whom she has a charged connection, just complicates things more!\r\n\r\nActing was top level, especially Brie Larson as Grace, but I could not say I didn't enjoy the easy going attitude of John Gallagher, Jr. as Mason, serious and intelligent Kaitlyn Dever as Jayden, confused Rami Malek as Nate, amazingly transformed Keith Stanfield as Marcus and one of the most natural young actors I've ever seen - Kevin Hernandez as Luis.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see performances to be remembered, have experience of sharply written screenplay and beautiful directing - this is a very special movie for you.",

They need people that are stable and don't think that they need to fix everything that's wrong in their lives.

            "content": "\"Short Term 12\" is one of those small-time indies that hit you big time (\"Safety Not Guaranteed\" and \"Garden State\" are amongst the most coveted). It tells the story of Grace (Brie Larson), a staff member of a foster care facility called Short Term 12, who encounters old demons when two people arrive in her life: Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), a new intake with an abusive past and Gace's very own unborn baby. There are some very dark places this movie goes to that are given such light, it's damn near impossible to deny the screenplay's emotional purity. To put it plainly, I have never seen a movie that has portrayed \"the troubled teen scenario\" with such delicate, un-filtered honesty as \"Short Term 12.\" Funny, heartbreaking, and soulful- this is one of the finest displays of natural acting and direction, whose combination of which creates one of the most emotionally satisfying and true cinematic experiences of 2013.

She is a perfect response to a decade to a manic pixie dream girl and their random works. And there is Keith Stanfield, who breaks out into this industry in a big way. There is nothing else this film worth to watch just for him, but there is the entire near-perfect ensemble cast. It is a one of the kind and should be considered a can't-miss for anyone because it is a rare film that puts together a touching storyline, true-to-life character and a sense of compassionate for humanity.",

The director probably wanted to treat his would-be very dramatic subject (child abuse, abandonment, loss) in a calm-at-the-surface-but-turbulent-inside way, but why he chose such fertile settings for a highly dramatic film for this one? The varied potential of his characters, leading and supporting alike, deserves a deeper look and better depiction. That's why I felt a little bit disappointed given the hype and praise for the film. Also, Brie Larson, a very distinctive and impressive face that I have known and liked since Scott Pilgrim, deserves more space to prove her talent, because from her peaceful yet energetic eyes, I know that she is capable for much more.",

            "content": "\"Look into my eyes, tell what it's like,\nTo live a life not knowing what a normal life's like.\"\n\nA sullen African-American teen, Marcus (Keith Stanfield), sits in a small bedroom rapping a cappella to an audience of his youth worker and his goldfish. When we look into his eyes, we can absolutely see that he never has, but has always longed to, know what a \"normal\" life's like. But for Marcus and the other underprivileged kids living at Short Term 12, the temporary foster care facility that gives this extraordinary little film its title, a normal life seems beyond their reach.\n\nWritten and directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, Short Term 12 centres around Grace (Brie Larson), a young woman who works at the home for at-risk youths with her boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jr.). As Grace explains to a rookie staffer, their job is not to play therapist or parent, but simply to \"create a safe environment\".\n\nThat can sometimes be a stressful responsibility given the dangerous tendencies some of these troubled youngsters have developed. However, as we learn through the impeccably gradual exposition of Grace's backstory, no one understands them and what they're going through better than her.\n\nShort Term 12 is one of those exceptional, unassuming dramas that requires no antagonists and no overt conflict for us to develop concern and attachment to its characters. Or at least, the conflicts that do propel the character arcs never turn the audience against a character. The film is populated entirely by decent, empathetic people principally at war with themselves, their pasts, and their futures, rather than with each other. The heated arguments and violent outbursts we witness merely open up windows through which we can see the true battles that rage inside against personal demons.\n\nCretton's near-perfect script never gives direct face to the evil that ubiquitously looms over the lives of these kids. It only ever reveals itself in the form of scars; emotional or physical, self-inflicted or by some oppressor. In essence, the abuse, neglect, and social indifference that has cursed these youths becomes an intangible and all more serious threat, but without pulling focus from what Short Term 12 is really about: healing the wounds.\n\nAnd there's plenty of healing to do. Not just for the teens inhabiting Short Term 12, but also (especially) for Grace. Although she is a strong, independent woman and a crucially positive role model for the wards under her care, her independence is in fact what weakens her the most. Every day she neglects to follow her own advice about emotional transparency, allowing the ghosts of her own troubled childhood to continue to haunt her.\n\nThese unresolved feelings come to the fore when a new girl, Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), arrives at Short Term 12. Jayden is a simmering mess of father issues with a history of cutting herself, to whom Grace finds she can relate all too well. While this allows her to slowly gain Jayden's trust and confidence, it also triggers long suppressed emotions that shake the fragile stability of Grace's life.\n\nAnother modest triumph (but a triumph nonetheless) of Cretton's screenplay is its use of simple symbolism to peel back the layers of characters who are, by nature of how Cretton conceived them, too scared or confused to open up explicitly. A goldfish can be more than a goldfish, a toy doll can reveal a lifetime of anguish, and a drawing of an armless octopus can manifest a soul's worth of unspoken thought and feeling.\n\nAll this precise writing wouldn't be worth its own ink without strong actors to interpret it, and Short Term 12 is blessed with an abundance of them. Every role, big and small, is beautifully played by a simply terrific cast, built organically around Brie Larson's quiet revelation at its centre. The combination of their earnest performances and Cretton's storytelling finesse makes Short Term 12 a picture that's easy to invest oneself in, and it's an investment that pays incredible dividends.\n\n**** out of ****",

Looked it up and it killed at Film Festivals and carries an 8.2 imdb rating and an 8.2 metacritic rating.\n\nFirst, it's one of those rare movies without a weak character. Given the range of problems the characters face, and given the age of the actors, this is a significant feat. Brie Larson definitely carries the movie, but John Gallagher's character (Mason) will go down as one of the greats. That is just one magnificent fucking character. Kaitlyn Dever as Jayden is also good, but Keith Stanfield kills it as Marcus. There is rarely a scene with him that cannot make the eyes a little moist.\n\nAnd that's what the movie is about: second chances and kindness. Mason leads the charge there as just a guy with a lot of patience and not a lot of judgement. Larson's character is close but she has her own demons. \n\nMany movies come to mind: Sling Blade, Girl, Interrupted. A few others. But definitely also Good Will Hunting. The more I live my own life, and it was definitely a theme here, sometimes people just need a hug and the line, \"It's not your fault.\" Goddamn it's brilliant in GWH, and though the line is never said in this movie, that's the sentiment expressed by the staff.

But instead of going the \"our protagonist also has minor problems herself so we can relate!\" route, \"Short Term 12\" gradually goes deeper and deeper until we suddenly discover that Grace's supervising at the mental home was the closest she could get to being a patient herself. \n\nBy the way, Brie Larson, as well as many of the other small actors in this film, is outstanding, and will hopefully go many places in the future",

This is only my second five star review from 2013 and this small indie absolutely hit all the right notes with me taking me through a wide range of emotions thanks to its perfect balanced mix of comedy and touching drama. I was drawn to these characters from the very opening scene and was completely engaged with the story. Having visited a foster care facility a couple times last year and spent some time with kids going through similar situations, this film really hit home and helped me empathize more with them. In a way I kind of felt like Nate, the new counselor in this film who didn't connect right away with the kids and there was not much he could do to help considering he had no idea where they were coming from. On the other hand, the two other counselors, Grace and Mason, really connected with the children because they came from similar backgrounds and understood how they were feeling. Short Term 12 writer and director, Destin Cretton, uses this film as a vehicle to let the viewer have a better understanding of the social situation these kids go through. I don't know if this would've worked so well if it weren't for the incredibly touching performances from the cast. Brie Larson is so great in this film, she hit all the right notes, and in some way she reminded me of Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone. She has that same potential and her career will definitely take off after this. She deserves an Oscar nomination because she's that good. Her co-lead, John Gallagher Jr. also delivers a terrific performance and if we haven't heard much about him it's because Larson steals most of the thunder here. Even the kids in this film were terrific and that's why I'm giving this film the highest possible grade because it does everything right.\n\nGrace (Brie Larson) is one of the young counselors at Short Term 12, a foster care facility for at risk teenagers. Along with Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), with whom she's in a relationship, they look after these kids who have come from a troubled past. The film opens with Mason welcoming a new counselor named Nate (Rami Malek), and he shares a story with him about his first day which didn't go too great. Then they introduce some of the kids to him: there's Marcus (Keith Stanfield) who's about to turn 18 and therefor will be leaving the facility soon, Sammy (Alex Calloway) who's going through a deep psychological trauma, and Luis (Kevin Hernandez) who's easygoing but enjoys bullying Marcus. A few days later a new teenage girl named Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) arrives at the foster care center who seems to be deeply scarred. Grace begins to connect with her and realizes they have come from a similar past. Grace and Mason are both excellent counselors, mostly because they have come from a troubled past themselves, and despite helping these kids they also have to deal with their own scars in life if they want their relationship to work. \n\nI loved the way that Cretton decided to open the film with Mason telling Nate a story, and then deciding to end it with another one. The structure of this film was just perfectly executed and I loved the balance it maintained. There were several different plots going on as each kid was going through different problems. The final scene in this film literally gave me goose bumps all over my body. Many people had an issue with it ending with such a positive note, but I thought it was perfect. Larson is a major reason why this film worked so well, her character Grace is just that: a graceful person who is doing her best to help these kids while at the same time trying to deal with her own demons. Dever and Stanfield also deliver powerful secondary performances and each one of them shares a memorable scene with one of their counselors as they try to express their feelings through different ways: Marcus does so by rapping and Jayden by reading a story. These two scenes are extremely powerful and emotional and they stand out in the film without feeling forceful or manipulative at all. This film just has so much heart and it's no surprise it has such a high rating (99% on Rottentomatoes) because it really is a vivid portrait that draws us in to these characters troubled lives in the pursuit and need of healing. Brie Larson's Grace has just become my favorite heroine of the year. That octopus story will stick with me forever, there was a lot of powerful stuff in this film.",

            "content": "Short Term 12 (2013)- 80%\nDestin Cretton directs Brie Larson (as Grace) and John Gallagher Jr. (Mason) in a powerful drama that focuses on the fragile world of under-privileged children with deeply penetrating precision and heart. We enter the dedicated lives of the young couple, Grace and Mason, as they train a new member of their team (Nate), at a safe-house where abused, troubled and challenged children are monitored, nurtured, disciplined and supported 24 hours a day. The film intimately and masterfully captures the unpredictable and often turbulent nature of these teen's lives and examines deeper subtleties of their experiences, like Marcus, who after years in protective abode must begin a new life outside its' safety walls. \nCretton genuinely explores the complexities of working with these kids through Grace, simultaneously weaving her own challenged relationships with her imprisoned father and her boyfriend Mason into the story. Ironically while she encourages the children's openness and communication her past serves as her Achilles heel; it hardens her to build up walls, allowing her to excel at her job, but also shuts out a fulfilling and trusting life with Mason. \nWhen Nate (Rami Malek) repeatedly divulges that he is \"not feeling well\" each time situations escalate in the house, Cretton captures the level of stamina and compassion that is required by staff who struggle with the fine line between the personal and personally-impersonal aspects of their responsibilities daily.\nIt is when Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), a reckless and difficult teen, arrives at the home that this fine line is further blurred exposing even deeper layers of pain and struggle in Grace. We gain more glimpses into her delicate interior and begin to question whether maybe she would be better suited for life in the home than hold the supervisor position. Cretton begins to craft a connection between these two girls that functions as their catharsis, powerfully transforming them in the process. \nThrough extraordinarily sincere performances, precise direction and a script that breathes life into horrible experiences with soothing compassion, humour and wit, Short Term 12 succeeds in gracefully entering us into a complex world that not only fascinates and terrifies us, but ultimately strengthens our hearts.",

While the film is a small and short indie, it is by no means a lightweight one.  The film focuses upon twentysomething Grace (Brie Larson - The Spectacular Now, 21 Jump Street) who is a kind, caring and authoritative voice at Short Term 12 who cares deeply for its residents as she too had a troubled upbringing.  She is forced to confront some of her own personal demons when a young girl arrives (Kaitlyn Dever - Bad Teacher) reminding her of her own past history she is unable to speak of to anybody ... including her long-time boyfriend Mason (John Gallagher Jr. - 'The Newsroom') who also works at the home.  Short Term 12 wisely chooses to center primarily on one character who is involved in the lives of others but it also never allows any of the periphery characters to feel un-important to Grace's story.  It is simply told and presented as it unfolds in a natural-feeling way.  The film reminds a viewer that not all kids have a happy-go-lucky life and that not all homelives are ideal.  Many of us have no idea what these kinds of kids go through ... and this film allowed me to see how quickly I do judge others in unfortunate situations many have no control over.  Grace herself is highly flawed ... but she tries.  And she loves.  She has learned what is important in life ... and this film shows us that.  Listen.  Learn.  Love.",

Then something happens in her personal life than begins to change her while she gets a new teen whom she takes a special interest in because she sees so much of herself in her.  This is a pretty solid little movie with a great performance by Larson.  Mark my words in the next few years she is gonna be a major actress.  She was the daughter on \"United States of Tara\", a show which few people watched but was amazing.  The kids in the home feel like kids that got plucked right out of the streets/bad homes.  They all do great.  The movie is one of those \"quiet\" movies with a lot of shakey camera shots and not a lot of background music.  It does drag some, but it never gets boring or tedious.

That one story that one of the girls narrates to the leading lady is just heart-breaking and also reveals so much about the character. Top notch performances by the entire cast, but it's the EXCEPTIONAL and ADORABLE Brie Larson that takes the larger share of the cake. She treads this tricky role with amazing poise and fleshes out this character full of repressed anguish with a crack that lets in just the right amount of hope. She grabbed my attention and held it till long after the movie ended. I wish she keeps getting amazing parts to play, because she sure as hell know how to play them, beautifully I might add.

Larson in particular does a marvelous job, playing a young woman who seems strong on the outside, but has problems of her own.

All very grounded and organic. Every performance is well executed. Some secrets you can see a mile away while others pop up and surprise you, but they all work. Great character development in the script here which allows everyone to bring their best to the table. Scenes come that leave you reflect. Many scenes come that make you laugh. Many scenes come that leave you with dread, while others leave you on the edge of your seat as the film tries to shake you out of it.\n\nThis is the type of film that deserves some major Oscar nominations, but because it's too small, it goes un-noticed without a trace come January. Hopefully I am wrong and the word of mouth that has been spreading really pushes this film to the forefront. Brie Larson gives a brilliant performance here. So do many of the other actors and actresses involved and though you might be able to recognize some of the cast, the characters feel all to real to the point that any Indie stardom they have built up on previous films is left on the back burner.

Grace's life is becoming a bit of a scramble as our story begins: she's recently found out that she is pregnant by her boyfriend, there is a new girl named Jayden who's not making Grace's job any easier with her obstructive behavior, and the soon-to-be-of-age, Marcus is acting up in his final weeks at the center just adds to her frustration.\nThis film (both in terms of it's story and it's film-style) is a beautiful mess -- what I mean by that is, \"Short Term 12\" has so many characters and so many subplots going on all at once, that it seems like the entire thing should fall apart at the seams, but it stays together due to the seemingly effortless way in which the film is paced. \"12\" runs around the setting like a roller coaster, never allowing the viewer to get bored or to feel too rushed, it's found just the right speed at which to showcase each of these characters and their individual lives in a very fluid, free-forming way. It's a visual story that feels so real that you begin to think you are actually watching these people simply live their lives (or try to).\nSpecial attention must also be drawn to Larson's performance, as well as Kaitlyn Dever's portrayal of Jayden -- the two separately make up some of the film's best acting, but together their chemistry on-screen makes for the best scenes in the entire movie (and possibly of the year 2013).\n\"Short Term 12\" is what happens when you bring together a little bit of everything that makes any film decent, and wrap it up into one single, small package: you get a rowdy, tear-jerking, film festival award-winning, work of art -- and love and labor and loss.

There's Marcus, an angry/sensitive black rapper who's about to get kicked out because he's turning 18. There's Luis, a Latino jock who likes to stir up trouble.  And then there's the new girl - Jayden.\n\nJayden is a smartass artist cutter with a rich daddy and a troubled home life. Grace tries to befriend her and get her to spill her deep dark secrets because not long ago she too was a cutter with deep dark secrets.  Actually, she kind of still is.\n\nIn the movie's main flaw, Grace suddenly finds herself facing a multitude of big personal issues all at once, and combined with the already tumultuous goings on back at the kids' home, it makes for just TOO...MUCH...DRAMA for a 96-minute film. The kid stuff alone is already pushing it a bit - each incident in and of itself seems realistic but is every single day really this action-packed? - but add to that Grace's abusive father getting out of jail, an unplanned pregnancy, getting fired from her job, and breaking up with her boyfriend and it starts to seem more like a blues song than a movie. \n\nThe kid stuff, though, is actually very good and almost documentary-like in its realism.  Marcus and Jayden both have very moving scenes in which they express themselves through rap lyrics and a children's story respectively.

Variety is what our multiplex cinemas should be all about. Unfortunately if no one shows up to see indie films, they will eventually be pushed out because frankly why would the multiplexes want to lose money on them?\n\nIt could be that people simply aren't aware of the existence of Short Term 12. Equally it could be that people want to spend their money on escapism and not the tough world that this film inhabits. Ultimately though there is a lot to take away from Short Term 12. It is a tough film but it is a rewarding one in equal measure. There are nicely placed moments of humour and it has a warm heart at the centre of it which does pay off. There aren't any performers who clock in anything less than an excellent performance but Brie Larson is the centre of the film and her turn as the care worker who has her own demons to deal with is star.

            "content": "Grace (Larsen) is a supervisor at the title facility, a foster home for troubled teens. Though it remains a secret from their charges, Grace and coworker Mason (Gallagher Jr) are lovers who live together. When Grace learns she is pregnant she initially keeps it a secret from Mason, placing a strain on their relationship as Mason grows tired of her mistrust. When a teenage girl, Jayden (Dever), with a history of self-mutilation arrives at the home, Grace is reminded of her own troubled past. Another kid under her charge is Marcus, due to leave in a couple of weeks when he turns 18, but seemingly unprepared for life in the outside world.\nRecent movies dealing with the issue of care-giving (the obnoxious 'Thanks For Sharing' and last year's 'Smashed') have tended to adopt a patronizing tone, in no way reflective of real life. The setup of 'Short Term 12' in the wrong hands could have easily been another offensive story of flawless white people saving minorities but writer-director Cretton (adapting a story he previously filmed as a short) gives us protagonists who are as flawed as those under their care.\n\nGrace constantly tells her kids they need to verbalize their issues, something she refuses to do herself, much to the annoyance of her incredibly patient boyfriend Mason. Explaining why she cut herself as teen, she tells Jayden \"When there's blood coming out of you, you don't have time to worry about anything else\" and this seems to be her motivation for caring for others, allowing herself to forget about her own troubled background by focusing on others' more urgent problems.\nI don't know if Cretton has a background of working in facilities like this, and I've never experienced one myself, but his portrayal of this world is thoroughly naturalistic and convincing, if slightly too good to be true. I've always loved movies that take you inside an unfamiliar lifestyle, be it the ambulance drivers of 'Mother, Jugs & Speed' or the cops of 'The New Centurions' (a movie this is very reminiscent of), and allow the rules and processes of their world to unfold in a natural way, like being thrown in at the deep end on your first day in a new job.\nLarsen is a revelation in the sort of meaty role young actresses are rarely afforded. The ensemble is roundly great though my one complaint is that the kids look a little too clean cut and feel a bit \"central casting\" when compared to the young untrained actors we've seen a lot lately in European films like 'The Selfish Giant' and 'The Kid With a Bike'.\nThough there's a dark undercurrent to the film, Crettin never lets things get too downbeat and avoids falling into the \"misery porn\" trap. While his film is populated with lovable characters, things never get schmaltzy and you in no way feel like your emotions are being cynically manipulated.\nI suspect the real world versions of these facilities are a lot more grim but, like Mason's anecdotes that bookend the film, 'Short Term 12' may not be grounded in truth but it sure is comforting.",

It seemed that if something was worth doing, it was worth doing at a preternaturally young age. Throughout my early years I tried hard to live up to these pretentions: in grade school, I attempted to write several novels (they all involved genetically-engineered dinosaurs and hubristic theme-park owners unable to contain them); at seventeen, I sent spec screenplays to Hollywood studios (my great accomplishment: receiving a rejection letter on official 20th Century Fox letterhead, signed by Batman Forever writer Akiva Goldsman). My ambitions, however, were grander than my talents. Or perhaps grander than my commitment to seeing them through. And your new film, Short Term 12, proves that you're a bit more committed to your ambitions than I was...

His film short Drakmar: a Vassal's Journey which he co-directed in 2006 won best documentary at the San Diego Comic-Con International. Then, in 2009, a short version of Short Term 12 won Best Short Award at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2010, he won an Academy of Arts and Sciences Nicholl Prize for his script of I am Not a Hipster, which was shown in the next category at Sundance, then he won another cash award from the Nicholl's to complete post production on his latest feature, which he wrote as well as directed,  Short Term 12. ST 12 won the audience award and the grand jury prize at the 2013 South by Southwest Festival in Austin and had its Maui premiere on June 16th where it won the audience award for best narrative feature drama. \n\nThis powerful film is a wonderful love story. When i was studying in New York, one of my teachers used to ask, \"Where is the love? If there's no love, we aren't interested.\"  Well, this film has every kind of love there is and I guarantee when you see it, you will love it as well.\n\nCretton, who is a great story teller and creates engaging, real characters, spent two years working in an adolescent residential center so he knows this subject intimately, but he insists this film, which at times feels like a documentary, is a work of fiction. \n\nThe film centers around Grace, a 20 something counselor at an adolescent residential center. Her life mirrors the kids that she is caring for. Played by Brie Larson in a performance worthy of an Oscar, with truth and honesty seldom seen on the screen, this is a story, which brings the audience into the world of troubled adolescents. These young people are in the center because they  have either been abandoned by their parents, committed to this place because their parents couldn't handle them or they have no parents or family to care for them.\n\nWe see their daily routine and the behaviors the staff is subjected to and how they understand and control these extremely difficult and often volatile situations.  \n\nGrace is a complex character, who is hiding lots of secrets. She is hiding her relationship with a co-worker, Mason, played by Newmakers and Tony Award Winning John Gallagher Jr. She refuses to share her past with him and she is trying to deal with being pregnant. \n\nInto this cauldron comes Jadyn, a goth girl who doesn't want to be a part of the \"family.\" she declares in her first meeting that she doesn't want to participate because she will be leaving soon. Kaitlyn Dever, of ABC's Last Man Standing embodies the essence of adolescent angst in this power house performance.  \n\nAlso there is tension between Marcus, Keith Stanfield and Luis, Kevin Hernandez. It explodes when Marcus's pet fish dies and Luis is suspected of picescide. Keith Stanfield is another exceptionally strong performer who imbues Marcus with deapth and complexity. his rap, which i was told he wrote, is both inciteful into the character and haunting. \n\nI said this was a love story and it is. Mason is the lover. He loves the kids, he loves his foster family and he loves Grace. His character is the new leading man, sensitive, yet strong, caring without being controlling, loving without being stifling. A true breath of fresh air in male characters. \n\nCretton has gotten truthful, real performances from young people for whom this is their first film and from veteran's like Larson who has been working since she was a child. There is not a weak link in this great cast. \n\nThis film has everything. A great story, that will touch your heart and your funny bone. Wonderful characters that you root for every moment, and important things to say about youth and young people.",

This film is one of those rare cases where I walked in knowing little to nothing about what I was going to experience, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a well balanced tone of what mirrors real life the closest. None of us live completely within the bounds of these genres that Hollywood has so conveniently put together so as to garner massive audiences for each one that cater to the dominant attitude one might carry. Despite the fact humans generally tend to gravitate towards specific personality traits or uncontrollable factors that determine how they are perceived the majority of us live a life filled with moments of equal highs and lows. Granted, this range of emotions is usually reserved to be explored in the smaller, less expensive films that tackle more singular subjects and therefor may have a more narrow audience looking for it, when they are done well they can likely appeal to whoever stumbles upon them and it seems Short Term 12 has the potential to have that appeal. Writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton has expanded his 2008 short film of the same name into feature length form and in doing so has given himself room to explore the devastating effects of what mental, physical and sexual abuse have on children and not just in the immediate aftermath but years and years on when you would hope the victim might have been able to look past and move on. It is as much an enlightening and inspirational film as it is a heart wrenching and extremely personal documentation of the individuals who have experienced such disgusting encounters and have had to grow and learn to adapt in a world that often times expects them to get over it without ever being able to accept the fact they could live what most of us would call a \"normal life\". With a strong script and some purely exceptional performances Short Term 12 turns out to be one of the more affecting films of the year that has probably been seen the least.   \n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

It is clearly one of the best movies of the year and it features one of the best acting performances in that of Brie Larson. The film centers on a foster home for trouble kids, by troubled I mean kids who are abused by parents or adults to the point they are at risk of committing suicide. The supervising staff is made up of young adults in their early 20's. The 2 main supervisors are Grace and Mason played with much care by Brie Larson and John Gallagher Jr. Their daily duties included looking after the kids, getting them to be social in groups and to check their room for any objects that do not belong in the facility. We meet the kids they are looking after - One of them Marcus, is just a week away from turning 18 which means he will have to leave the home. Through a couple of powerful scenes our eyes are painfully opened to Marcus' troubled past and we get some understanding of what he must be feeling. I say \"some\" because as great as this movie is, it is difficult to ever fully feel what some of these poor kids do. We also meet Jayden, a young girl who is new to the home. Grace connects with Jayden as she sees much of her self in her. And speaking of Grace, we learn more about her own trouble past and what led her to a life devoted to helping these young troubled kids out. Brie Larson is simply outstanding from start to finish and this is not a simple character to play. I also can not say enough good things about the screenplay written by writer/director Destin Cretton. It would be easy to make a movie on this matter and just focus on the kids, but by including the young supervisor's struggles as well he has given us a true gem of a film. The movie opens and closes with the telling of a story - both are funny, yet one is sad...and one is uplifting....and that sums up Short Term 12 - funny, sad, uplifting.

It is simple, naturalistic in its execution, with brilliantly nuanced pyrotechnics of the \"heart.\" We witness heroism in what is anything but glamorous; the ordinary, day-to-day, routinely interpersonal (and intra-personal) challenges of work in a group home for foster kids. These teens are shuffled from home to institution to home, witnessing and enduring unspeakable abuse.  Growing increasingly unwilling to open their hearts in the frightening uncertainty of their existence, these teens can be certain of only one thing - chronic rejection, by others and by themselves. We meet Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) and Marcus (Keith Stanfield) amongst others, in the group home where they routinely test boundaries, unconsciously driven to determine what is and isn't safe. The staff, deftly led by Grace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher, Jr.) offer such safety, and much more; they test the boundaries of their own hearts, their capacity to love, as determined by their willingness to go towards pain, when every natural inclination is to run the other way. The result is a powerfully moving unfolding of truth, and as such, beauty. We experience beauty in the form of the enduring human spirit; A spirit that will, in darkness, if given just a little bit of love, find a smoldering ember in your heart, and light a fire.",

That is until I saw Short Term 12.\n\nThe plot & premise of Short Term 12, while not entirely original, was beautifully executed by allowing important plot details to slowly seep into the viewers minds, writer/director Destin Cretton mastered the art of good storytelling.\n\nThe main attraction to this masterpiece was an against type performance from Brie Larson, fresh off her comedic turn in last year's 21 Jump Street. Her character Grace deals with a troubled young girl named Jaydenwho is new to the short term facility, whose problems eerily echo the myriad of troubles hidden beneath the depths of Grace herself.\n\nThis film had wonderful supporting roles & performances. The two that stand out are Mason, played by The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr., as Mason, Grace's boyfriend/co-worker with the patience of a saint. The second performance that was noteworthy was that of Keith Stanfield as Marcus, the troubled teenager who is just about to turn 18.\n\nOverall, the two moments that I think sold the movie for me is the scene where Marcus performs his rap for him, and the scene where Jayden shows Grace her octopus story. Both scenes showed you a lot of how the characters feel in a rather unconventional manner.\n\nOverall, this film is already one of my favorites for 2013, and will definitely be placed in my top 10 for the year. Hopefully, the Oscar committee feels the same way that I do come nominations time. Rating: 4/4 Stars\n\n-K.",

In fact, the movie feels almost documentarian at points, which came close to keeping me at a bit of an emotional distance - because my life experience is so far removed from the circumstances depicted - but in the end, it was the work of lead actress Brie Larson that made everything work for me.  She gives a superb performance, a nuanced and moving portrait of a quite complex, enormously empathetic young woman.  The actual narrative itself follows the kinds of contours that we might expect (save for a brief sequence in the third act that is surprisingly suspenseful, and had me wondering if the movie was about to get REALLY dark), but it doesn't really embrace cliche, either.  That being said, it's Cretton's clear point-of-view/authorial voice and Larson's work that really elevates the plot.",

            "content": "It's rare for a movie to be emotionally devastating while also being overwhelmingly inspirational and hopeful, but Short Term 12 achieves the nigh impossible.\n\nShort Term 12 follows the inhabitants of a small foster care center in Middle America. Many of the kids have been taken from their biological parents because of abuse, neglect, imprisonment, or death. Many have never known a stable home life. And many will age out of the system at 18 and be trusted to make something on the outside by their lonesome. Grace (Brie Larson) is the lead counselor for the center. She's dating a co-worker, Mason (The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr.) and pregnant, unsure of where to go from here. As the center prepares for one Marcus' (Keith Stanfield) age-out departure, they welcome Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) to their abode. Jayden's well-connected father is getting his life in order for full custody, but it also becomes clear that her home life is a danger to her well-being. Grace fights to get Jayden to open up, then she fights to keep her safe, all the while forcing her to deal with her own long hidden pain. \n\nIt's so easy to get engaged in this movie. The very setting calls for plenty of drama and pain to be explored, and it will be, but that doesn't mean that the film goes overboard with histrionics. The characters are written with such naturalistic ease, allowing an audience to understand them without judgment. These people, be they the foster kids or the counselors, feel refreshingly, exceedingly, magnificently like flesh-and-blood people. The characters feel lived in, their struggles feel real, and their responses are sincere. The foster care system in this country is grueling. A counselor needs a big heart, thick skin, and an immeasurable supply of patience. There are a lot of abused kids in the system, just hoping to find an adult who wishes to love them, to nurture them, to care. The kids don't want pity, they are perturbed when they're referred to as \"underprivileged youth.\" What they really want is respect and sincerity. Highly charged emotions are a given considering the circumstances of the characters, but what makes Short Term 12 exceptional is that they are fully earned. We don't just feel for these kids because they've suffered, we feel for them because they are presented as characters instead of martyrs. I was emotionally moved throughout, tearing up several times, feeling heartbroken at turns and then brimming with buoyant hope at others. It's a balancing act the movie masters. \n\nWriter/director Destin Cretin (actually remaking his 2008 short film of the same name) explores these characters in gentle waves, allowing the characters to open up in ways that don't feel forced. You learn about these characters and their history bit by bit, sometimes through creative expression where one must read between the lines. Marcus might seem to be one character, then his rap song he write reveals an aching degree of personal pain, and then the revelation for why he wants to shave his head, which at first just seems like an average teenage compulsion, will break your heart all over again. You yearn for these kids beyond measure, wanting them to taste delayed happiness in this world, but you also understand why they're so guarded, why the system grinds together as it does. This is no polemic overburdened with speechifying and soapboxes. It doesn't really make any larger points about foster reform or the people who run the system. Instead Cretin gives every participant in the film complexity, empathy, and humanity. Even Grace's supervisor, easily set up for quick blame about decision-making, is allowed empathy. You feel the man's plight as he tries to make the best out of a bad situation, which is exactly what the counselors are trying to do themselves with their charges. Cretin's emphasis is on his characters and not necessarily on making overt political attacks. I knew within minutes that I was in for something special. You can feel it with the dialogue, how easily Cretin is shaping character without splurging on exposition. These people come alive under Cretin's watch, and you'll be pulled in within mere moments. \n\nThis is also fundamentally a star making performance for Larson. The young actress has had visible roles in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, 21 Jump Street, and TV's The United States of Tara, but nothing prepared me for the power of her performance. Larson's character has plenty of personal pain and secrets and a gnawing sense of futility, but she pushes forward, trying to make a difference somehow in this world. You feel her intensity and determination but you also feel her setbacks and uncertainty. Larson never strays outside the emotional bounds of her character, staying true to her aims. Grace is no saintly and selfless figure. She's paying a real price keeping her own pain bottled up, focusing completely on others so that she doesn't have to assess her own damage, but Jayden forces her to examine her own history. Larson serves as the dependable emotional anchor of some very choppy waters. In a just world, Larson's name would be bandied about come awards season, but the overall small, understated nature of Short Term 12 and its limited release leaves me in doubt. However, there is no doubt that Larson gives a deeply humane, gripping, heartfelt and marvelous performance. \n\nThe character relationships are just as compelling and provide a rich texture to this world. The dynamics within the foster center are interesting, nothing as simplistic as slotting kids into staid high school types. There are divisions within the home, chiefly between Marcus and an antagonistic Luis, but it's also invigorating when you witness the various kids come together in solidarity and community, when they look out for one another. Jayden is surly at first but won't let on how truly hurt she is that her father missed her birthday. Marcus leads the other kids and they all make a slew of birthday cards to cheer her up, make her feel that someone out there cares. It's a small gesture, and yet when it plays out it hits with a wallop. The relationship between Grace and Mason is sweet and frustrating, representing a romantic coupling of two people with an obvious connection but also enough baggage to derail potential long-term success. Gallagher Jr. is a nice fit for the part. I really enjoyed how Mason is developed as the film progresses. Initially he seems like a pseudo-cool authority figure, then a scruffy screw-up, then a sincere and grateful individual worried about Grace and aggravated by his inability to help Grace.\n\nThere are movies that feel true in a broad sense but clumsy with the fine details, and vice versa, but Short Term 12 is that rare movie that feels so authentic that it could have been a documentary. Sure there is convenient plot developments and a tidiness that life just doesn't want to provide, but the overall impression is remarkably genuine. The character feel like actual people, their world feels recognizable, and their struggles feels familiar and relatable and raw. Short Term 12 doesn't glorify the counselors, nor does it demonize or sanctify the kids under their care. Here is an unblinking look at the sheer weight of the work of trying to provide for those in need. The movie is a potent drama with several heartbreaking incidents, but I don't want to scare people off with the impression that Short Term 12 is all artsy doom and gloom. On the contrary, the film is resolutely hopeful in the face of such dire adversity. The perseverance of the counselors, as well as the kids striving for independent lives, is what I walk away with. Not the abuse, not the systematic neglect, but the indomitable perseverance of the human spirit to transcend damage and to succeed anew. This is the long-lasting impact of this superb movie. It's not about the pain inflicted, rather than human connections forged and the optimism of recovery. Not everything will get its happy ending, but it is inspiring to watch people put it all on the line, thanklessly. Short Term 12 is the kind of movie you bug your friends until they finally watch it. Ladies and gents, commence bugging.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

But Short Term 12 is something else: something fresh that eschews easy sentiment and preaching. It's more than an exceptional film, it's a gift. Set in GoldDerby, a short-term foster care ward for at-risk teens, Short Term 12 lucks out with a gifted cast and a terrific script that doesn't spell everything out for us. The supervisors for GoldDerby are 20-ish counselors Grace (the amazing Brie Larson), who seems to be in most control of herself, even though she's hiding a pregnancy and relationship with co-worker Mason (John Gallagher Jr.). Grace and Mason arent treating their kids as if they're doctors, their role is to provide a steady hand. The kids include brooding Marcus (Keith Stanfield), who fights his demon with raps, Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever) a cutter with a steely attitude. These aren't exactly new character types, but Short Term 12, written and directed with astonishing grace and grit by Destin Daniel Cretton, who has experience working at similar facilities. Cretton doesn't avoid harsh truths, he lays them out. That the film also gets to you ad shakes you is also a tribute to the actors. Gallagher Jr., freed from the hackneyed claptrap of HBO's The Newsroom, is excellent as a guy who cannot always do the right thing.And Larson (The Spectacular Now, 21 Jump Street) is more than superb. She turns in one of the year's very best performances. She's the heart of a film that digs deep and really gets to you.",

            "content": "The coming out party for Brie Larson is complete. After delightful turns in Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, 21 Jump Street, and The Spectacular Now, Larson gets a starring vehicle in Short Term 12. As good as Larson is here, Short Term 12 is even better since it gives insight into the day-to-day lives of temporary living arrangements from the perspectives of the workers and the kids. Expertly written and shot by Destin Cretton, Short Term 12 gives some well deserved attention to people who don't receive enough of it. \r\n\r\nGrace (Brie Larson) and Mason (John Gallagher Jr.) are a couple who feel compelled to work at a Short Term 12 facility taking care of kids with nowhere else to go. They are both very good at establishing connections with these children, but for different reasons. Mason feels the need to give back due to his foster upbringing, but Grace's aid comes from a darker place. She has a more fragile emotional state than she lets on and big life events come to her in the form of a pregnancy and Jayden (Kaitlyn Dever), a child with a similar past to Grace's. \r\n\r\nThe camerawork in Short Term 12 draws the viewer into a very intimate and delicate situation. These people in the shelter are so hurt that any further pain can push them over the edge. Watching Short Term 12 is like standing on the edge of a knife; even when things go well, a wrong turn of a phrase or confiscation of dolls can be enough to cause a character to spiral downward into a pit of despair. Dragging a broken person from that type of personal hell requires great patience, understanding, and lots of luck outside of your control. Short Term 12 succeeds at showing the entire process to the audience. The little \"wins\" where the kids open up are so emotionally rewarding and satisfying leaving the audience with a massive high, only to be dragged back down by what can appear to a normal person a small inconvenience. Most importantly, these scenes (until the final act) don't feel manipulative. The kids are smart people who just don't understand what a normal life is like, and the caretakers are smart enough to break the sullen shell of a malcontent and find a moment of raw connection. \r\n\r\nEqually as compelling as the Short Term facility is Grace's personal story. Slowly revealed over the course of the film, Grace herself is walking on pins and needles. Work gives her focus and purpose, and outside forces are banging on her door leaving her at a loss for what to do. Her emotional scars have turned into scabs that cover herself from those closest to her. By not coming to terms with her past, Grace has trouble moving on to her future with Mason, who only asks to let him inside her head. These scenes provide much needed humor, but also add layers to Grace's character that make the payoffs all the more satisfying.\r\n\r\nThis film takes a calculated risk on Brie Larson's ability to carry a film mostly on her own, with great success. Larson is wonderful here: a strong woman put through the ringer and coming out the other side, but not without some consequences. She can be simultaneously caring and cold, smart and illogical, etc. She also has some help around her. John Gallagher Jr. is very good as Mason, playing a very likable caregiver and love interest who tries to coax Grace out of her cocoon. Kaitlyn Dever is wonderful as Jayden, a younger version of Grace. Dever nails her characters mask of hurt with sarcasm, but when she snaps, she snaps. Keith Stanfield and Rami Malek get nice arcs as a troubled kid and na√Øve new counselor respectively. \r\n\r\nShort Term 12 exposes the world to the underbelly of society people like to forget exists. In the struggle to force people to conform to societal standards regardless of who you are and where you came from, Short Term 12 focuses on the people who fall through the cracks and the people who notice and take action. Kudos to the filmmakers for taking this story, the people involved, and their plight seriously. I will also never take a fish for granted again.",

            "content": "Wow. Wow. Wow. The credits begin to roll after Short Term 12 ends, and these are the primary thoughts racing through my head after experiencing such an emotionally dense film. Despite its simplistic storyline, Short Term 12 is nothing short of extraordinary, because it forces us to experience the full spectrum of human emotions as the film progresses-quick-witted humor, sorrow, apathy, and ultimately, the existential significance of the decisions we make as we grow as emotional human beings. Short Term 12, without a doubt, stands out as one of the greatest and most impactful indie films of 2013, and it deserves much acclamation for its gorgeous cinematography, deeply moving plot, and realistically humane style.\n\nShort Term 12 follows Grace, our kind-hearted yet troubled protagonist working at a foster-care home for underprivileged and troubled children, named-you guessed it-Short Term 12. Grace is the best at what she does-connecting with children living in the home and helping them through their social and emotional issues. She lives with her boyfriend Mason, and early into the film, Grace receives the news that she is pregnant. This unplanned pregnancy-along with various anxiety and familial issues-are all demons Grace must battle internally to remain strong and effective as a caretaker at the facility. Shortly thereafter, Short Term 12 receives a new intake named Jayden, a darkly dressed and bad-mannered teenage girl. Grace learns to connect quite well with Jayden, along with other members of the home, due to her similarly painful past.\n\nThe beauty of Short Term 12 lies in its striking realism, immersive character development, and engagingly symbolic cinematography. Every character has their moment to shine as we notice their individualistic mannerisms and the seemingly unimportant objects they pay attention to, each with its own emotionally dense backstory per respective character. Not a single scene is wasted in Short Term 12, relying on single-shot frames of scenery, events, and facial expressions as symbolic representations of the story being told. The film is both light-hearted and powerfully somber, injected with quick-witted humor the entire way through while slowly inching its way into your heart. \n\nThroughout its entertaining playfulness, Short Term 12 also forces you to face the dark realities of life, such as the children that suffer in neglected or abusive homes and its psychological consequences. This film is truly an accomplishment for indie cinema, because few films can be so amusingly clever and boldly genuine. At one point in the film, Mason is retelling one of his favorite stories and states, \"It was so f**king cute, I almost pissed my pants.\" The same can be said about Short Term 12, because it is a film that is simply impossible not to adore.",

            "content": "While we aren't likely to get sympathy from anybody, it becomes a tough slog keeping track of the literally hundreds of movies that muscle their way into theaters every year. Especially during those arduous summer months, where every expensive blockbuster looks and sounds the same, the characters have all the substance of rice paper, and whether the film is even worth the price of a single ticket a dozen sequels are already on the way. What little aspirations these movies have don't really amount to much, and mostly they'll be forgotten in the time it takes to cross the mall food court. But then a film like Short Term 12 emerges out of nowhere and blindsides you in a way few movies could ever hope to, and serves as a reminder of why you fell in love with cinema in the first place.\n\nThose are big words, and Short Term 12 lives up to them in every way possible. It's a spark plug of a film, the sort of life-affirming, uplifting piece that Hollywood doesn't make any more. You have to go out and work to find a movie like this, and while that's sad in its own right, you'll be much happier for having done it. The supremely talented Brie Larson is Grace, a young woman working at a short term foster care facility watching over at-risk (don't call them underprivileged!) teens. She's fierce, empathic, and protective to a fault, but Grace also has a warmth and dry humor that is instantly welcoming. Her live-in boyfriend Mason (The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr.), all scraggly and earnest, works with her at the facility and they form a sort of power couple, although the kids aren't supposed to know they're dating.\n\nWhen we first meet them both, it's on Nate's (Rami Malek) first day working there, and while Mason is deep into a self-deprecating story about a run-in with a minor that led to an unfortunate sharting incident, one of the youths in their charge bursts through the doors headed for the street. At first it's unclear whether we should take it seriously or if it's supposed to be funny, but the reactions by Grace and Mason tell it all. They've seen this before. They're used to it. They've lived it. The boy is having a panic attack. They deal with it. Calmly. Simply. Dealing with the problems of others is what they're good at. Dealing with their own issues is a different story.\n\nYou hear that a film takes place at a foster home and probably the first instinct is to write it off as just another sickly sweet melodrama or one so brutally uncomfortable and depressing it should come with a warning label. The magic of Short Term 12 is that it's neither of those things. Yes, it has moments that will reach into your heart and fill it with the utmost joy, but there are just as many that are heart breaking. The trick is that writer/director Destin Cretton plays them all with the same level-headed approach, never under playing or over selling the very real emotions on display.\n\nWe think we have Grace all figured out, she's smart and tough and takes no crap from anybody. But then we learn right along with her that she's pregnant, and what we don't fully understand is why she doesn't seem to be happy about it. It's not for the usual concerns, that much is clear. And Mason seems like the perfect All-American guy. Those questions swirl believably to create a storm that eventually begins to break the stoic Grace down. The arrival of Jaden (Kaitlyn Dever), a rebellious young girl who spends weekends with her busy father, dredges up old memories Grace would rather forget, and her inability to deal with her past problems threatens to ruin her future with Mason.\n\nCretton is truly writing to his strengths here, having worked in a facility just like this at one point. He populates the film with believable characters that could have easily been stereotypes, but are so much richer as their stories unfold. There's Marcus (the incredible Keith Stanfield), who has been there for years and faces uncertainty now that he's 18 and must leave the facility. Like prisoners who don't know how to function on the outside, Marcus begins acting out in increasingly desperate fashion. To him, foster care was a port in the storm, after a horrific upbringing seemed to map out a terrible life that could only end in two ways: jail or death.\n\nRevelations unfold with the patience and care they deserve, never for a moment hitting a false chord. What's more, they actually inform us about who these characters are. Every word, every moment has meaning, has real impact. What looks like a random party for Mason's parents becomes one of the affecting and touching scenes in the film, letting us in on exactly why he values honesty and family more than anything else. Mostly it's Jaden and Grace who gets the biggest breakthroughs, and like life they come when you least expect it. It's a true emotional roller coaster, one that comes with incredible highs and terrible lows. You'll laugh as Grace and Jaden beat up an inflatable dog as a means of therapy, or at Mason's lame attempts to be cool. You'll cry as one reveals a deeply-rooted personal tragedy, or when another slips into destructive habits. And then you'll probably cry tears of happiness at all of the little triumphs along the way. Ok, so it's a little crazy that so many events hit this one facility in the span of a few days, it never for a second feels less than authentic. Only at one time, when Grace goes a little nutso and begins taking matters into her own hands does Cretton go a bit overboard. While the actions Grace takes are probably consistent given her protective nature, it veers a little into \"wish fulfillment\" territory.\n\nLarson has always been a fantastic actress, who has stolen scenes in 21 Jump Street, The Spectacular Now, and in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Don Jon, but her performance is the kind that careers are made of. It's a tough balancing act to portray a character like Grace, who is so tough and confident, yet fragile and scared at the same time. She captures the look of someone who has been through a lot and expects to go through a lot more, and will work tirelessly to make sure others don't have to endure the same. There's a wonderful, lived-in quality to all of the portrayals here, so much so that at times you may think you're watching a really well-made documentary.\n\nShort Term 12 has already amassed a number of awards on the festival circuit, and it deserves every single one. It deserves more, actually. It deserves to have some awards created specifically for it. As you might expect, there are no simple endings to this story, but the ending we do get is a hopeful and spirited one, and it may just have you looking at life with brighter eyes.",

Inside, Nate says he took the job to work with underprivileged kids which Marcus(Keith Stanfield) takes grave offense to.  When he turns 18, all Marcus wants for his birthday is to have his head shaven.  Jayden(Kaitlyn Dever, of \"Justified\"), a new arrival, figures she will not be sticking around the facility long enough for her to turn 18.  Outside, Grace and Mason are a couple, with Mason wondering why it has been 9 days and 13 hours since they have had sex.  Maybe that has something to do with Grace being pregnant which Mason does not know about, yet.\r\n\r\nIf you have to see only one movie about troubled teenagers this September featuring Brie Larson...well, I haven't seen \"The Spectacular Now,\" yet, so it will have to be \"Short Term 12\" which in any case is very much worth it, especially due to its excellent performances.  In addition to one scene that almost made me want to cry, the movie uses humor well to modulate the emotions and to relieve the tension while the characters use it to deflect.  Overall, this is a situation where all the characters, both adults and teenagers, are facing an uncertain future where the youth are watched over by people not much older than they are.  Of particular interest is Grace, whose past is gradually revealed and knowing what she knows about herself has to decide what kind of parent she will be, if any.",

Brie Larson (21 Jump Street) gives an Oscar-worthy performance and perhaps the best performance of the year as a young supervisor of a home for at-risk teens. The performance is natural and true. Her own past has taught her to deal with the kids, but at the same time, it has prevented her from moving on. The movie is about the struggles of dealing with troubled childhoods and trying to find the light to a better future. The performances are raw and real and the teen actors are just as good as the adults. This is a heartbreaking, sometimes funny, but very sobering story that will leave you speechless for its brutal honesty of these teens and adults trying to live a better life. This is one of the best films of the year and should not be missed. \n\nGrade: A",

The film follows Grace (Brie Larson) as she supervises a home for at-risk teens. With each interaction, at work and at home, a new set of issues is at hand, progressing naturally and hauntingly to the breaking point for our leading actress. Directors don't just stumble upon strong emotions like these; they are masterfully honed and developed by a keen touch and existing emotions ready to evoke. Brie Larson does an expert job of portraying these emotions, thoughtfully, absorbing the content and expressing it with a believability that keeps the film on course and never over the top. The supporting roles create a strong emotional foundation for the film as well, with excellent showings from the at-risk teens in Kaitlyn Dever, Keith Stanfield, Alex Calloway, and Kevin Hernandez all of whom take their somewhat small roles and carry them to the next level, with understated emotional responses to their surroundings. John Gallagher Jr. balances out Larson's performance with some much needed comic relief. Independent films can be a mixed bag, relying heavily on the competence of the director and the resonance of their voice alongside the cast and how versatile and emphatic they are in their performance. \"Short Term 12\" is easily one of the strongest independent films of the year and spells a long successful career ahead for both Brie Larson and director Destin Cretton.",

Taking on a hot-button and rarely explored film subject in the form of the youth foster care system, Cretton makes many resounding statements that are as thoroughly fleshed out and multi-dimensional as Brie Larson's meditative central performance. The writer-director aptly stays far away from rookie mistakes and the film, despite its topical weight never feels heavy-handed or didactic. The dialogue feels and is presented naturally and efficiently but also quite bitingly. One standout part (out of many) includes a very raw scene between John Gallagher Jr.'s empathetic Mason and one of the more troubled youths named Marcus who opens up to his counselor in the form of a rap that left me (as well as Mason himself) speechless. Another comparative scene happens between Grace and tomboy Jaden who shares a short story as a metaphor for paternal sexual abuse and neglect. The stakes in the film, for all of the characters, are never greater as each beat strikes the perfect semblance of heartwarming sentiment and grave brutality. There are many more light-hearted moments throughout as well, especially in the first act, that keep the film from feeling like an albatross. If ever you thought of entering this line of work for at-risk teens and the sacrifices it entails, this film will serve as documentary. This film, much like 'Fruitvale Station' and last year's breakout Aaron Paul star-vehicle 'Smashed' gives me hope for the fate of independent cinema. A must see.",

Short Term 12 is also as excellently scripted as it is mounted, with there never being a dull moment in the film, and the lighting gives the film an artful veneer without sacrificing its plausibility, which means Destin Daniel Cretton only needed one film for me to start calling him one of our country's best new filmmakers. Hell, the film would be a must-see alone for Brie Larson's performance, as the young actress has made some notable bit parts over the year, but here we discover that she's an actress of great range and somber effect, playing a very complex character. There's really something for everything in this movie, as it's equal parts joyful, meditative, hip, plausible, intense and heart-breaking, and it will certainly be considered one of the year's very best films.

            "content": "In the midst of films such as The World's End, Elysium, Kick-Ass 2, and numerous summer movies, you become overwhelmed by these movies, full of action and explosions. But then there's a movie that sneaks in, coming out of nowhere, that makes you stop and think about life. A movie that tugs at the heartstrings and makes you feel emotions reminding you how powerful a simple film can be. Short Term 12 did just that.\n\nThis film centers around a group home which houses abused and troubled children and the individuals that work there. We specifically see the story play out through the eyes of Grace, who's basically the supervisor at the place. We see the kids from an outside perspective at first, seeing their daily activities, from the time they wake up to the time they go to sleep. But then it starts going deeper where we meet two children that live there: Marcus and Jayden.\n\nThe movie starts out in a joyous tone where Mason, a worker at the home, tells of a funny story involving one of the kids at the home. But then the tone changes when we meet one of the children for the first time, running away from the home, screaming profanities at the top of his lungs. At that point, we realize how serious this movie was.\n\nOne of the kids Jayden, has just transferred to the home. She's an angry child, filled with rage, and masks her emotions with her sarcastic wit. Her journey is done well, seeing how her mind works and the emotions she gives off. We see her growing relationship between Grace and Jayden as they are mirror reflections of each other. Jayden has a haunting tale especially through the story of The Shark and the Octopus seeing the difficulty of her opening up and being ashamed of experiencing it. Seeing Jayden struggle, Grace starts to open up about her past. She too is a troubled individual and we get to see one of the reasons why she works at the home in the first place.\n\nMarcus on the other hand has been living at the home for quite some time and will be turning 18 in about a week. His story was the one that really connected me. He's a kid with a tough exterior. His childhood is coming to an end which means he will be an adult soon, meaning that he will have to leave Short Term 12. We see that difficulty of him struggling to face the fact that he will leave the only he place he's called home. He's gonna leave the sanctuary. We see him grow as a person, seeing his layers be peeled away. He's a quiet boy, only expressing his thoughts through a rap. After a meltdown he experienced, he opened up letting Mason hear one of his songs. This was one of the most powerful scenes and the most haunting. Just in the span of one song, he opens up and he becomes the most vulnerable. His voice starts off strong, angry and powerful. His lyrics were full of profanities especially towards his mother. But as it plays out, it becomes deeper and his voice starts to crack and his eyes start to water. \"Look into my eyes so you know what it's like, to live a life not knowing what a normal life's like.\" And when it ends with that, it was utter silence both in the movie and in the theaters.\n\nThe whole movie was pretty much an emotional fest. But there were upbeat moments. There were surprise, joyous moments, that relieved the tension throughout the film. It crushes your heart at one point leaving you with tears gushing down your face and then the next thing you know, you're laughing hysterically and you're smiling with such relief.\n\nWhat I found most interesting is that throughout this movie, we never see the abusers or any of the abuse played out. All we see is the outcome of those actions. We see the emotional outrage the kids face due to the abuse. We see their point of views of the abuse. In addition to the challenges the kids are experiencing internally, we see them struggle with reliance of drugs and the hardship the system faces trying to understand what these kids need.\n\nDirector and filmmaker, Destin Daniel Cretton does a wonderful job displaying a real life scenario of a group home and the relationships the workers have with the children. It could be because he spent a year and a half in a group home as well, just before he attended film school. I don't think anybody could have done it as well as him. Certain scenes in this film are actually based on real life experiences of Cretton as a worker.\n\nBrie Larson as Grace, is one of the best things about this movie. She plays it real and normal having a subtlety to her performance. Her performance is perfect and stunning playing a person dealing with mixed emotions and one that has a\"hot and cold\" nature. Her portrayal of Grace is definitely Oscar worthy and should be nominated for one. Actually, Short Term 12 is a film that I hope would be taken into consideration for an Oscar.\n\nIf you can't tell by my review, this movie is a definite must see. It's one of those films that's a whole different cinematic universe. It reminded me why I love movies so much. The poignant moments in the film mixed with the upbeat moments were haunting and heartbreaking. The movie never gets melodramatic and \"soap-operatic\". It just portrays a realism to these situations.  Those scenes mixed with the top notch performances delivered a truly masterful experience.\n\n4.6/5\n\nCheck out more of my movie reviews: http://mswintersoldier.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "While we aren't likely to get sympathy from anybody, it becomes a tough slog keeping track of the literally hundreds of movies that muscle their way into theaters every year. Especially during those arduous summer months, where every expensive blockbuster looks and sounds the same, the characters have all the substance of rice paper, and whether the film is even worth the price of a single ticket a dozen sequels are already on the way. What little aspirations these movies have don't really amount to much, and mostly they'll be forgotten in the time it takes to cross the mall food court. But then a film like Short Term 12 emerges out of nowhere and blindsides you in a way few movies could ever hope to, and serves as a reminder of why you fell in love with cinema in the first place.\n\n \n\nThose are big words, and Short Term 12 lives up to them in every way possible. It's a spark plug of a film, the sort of life-affirming, uplifting piece that Hollywood doesn't make any more. You have to go out and work to find a movie like this, and while that's sad in its own right, you'll be much happier for having done it. The supremely talented Brie Larson is Grace, a young woman working at a short term foster care facility watching over at-risk (don't call them underprivileged!) teens. She's fierce, empathic, and protective to a fault, but Grace also has a warmth and dry humor that is instantly welcoming. Her live-in boyfriend Mason (The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr.), all scraggly and earnest, works with her at the facility and they form a sort of power couple, although the kids aren't supposed to know they're dating.\n\n \n\nWhen we first meet them both, it's on Nate's (Rami Malek) first day working there, and while Mason is deep into a self-deprecating story about a run-in with a minor that led to an unfortunate sharting incident, one of the youths in their charge bursts through the doors headed for the street. At first it's unclear whether we should take it seriously or if it's supposed to be funny, but the reactions by Grace and Mason tell it all. They've seen this before. They're used to it. They've lived it. The boy is having a panic attack. They deal with it. Calmly. Simply. Dealing with the problems of others is what they're good at. Dealing with their own issues is a different story.\n\n \n\nYou hear that a film takes place at a foster home and probably the first instinct is to write it off as just another sickly sweet melodrama or one so brutally uncomfortable and depressing it should come with a warning label. The magic of Short Term 12 is that it's neither of those things.  Yes, it has moments that will reach into your heart and fill it with the utmost joy, but there are just as many that are heart breaking. The trick is that writer/director Destin Cretton plays them all with the same level-headed approach, never under playing or over selling the very real emotions on display.\n\n \n\nWe think we have Grace all figured out, she's smart and tough and takes no crap from anybody. But then we learn right along with her that she's pregnant, and what we don't fully understand is why she doesn't seem to be happy about it. It's not for the usual concerns, that much is clear. And Mason seems like the perfect All-American guy. Those questions swirl believably to create a storm that eventually begins to break the stoic Grace down. The arrival of Jaden (Kaitlyn Dever), a rebellious young girl who spends weekends with her busy father, dredges up old memories Grace would rather forget, and her inability to deal with her past problems threatens to ruin her future with Mason.\n\n \n\nCretton is truly writing to his strengths here, having worked in a facility just like this at one point. He populates the film with believable characters that could have easily been stereotypes, but are so much richer as their stories unfold. There's Marcus (the incredible Keith Stanfield), who has been there for years and faces uncertainty now that he's 18 and must leave the facility. Like prisoners who don't know how to function on the outside, Marcus begins acting out in increasingly desperate fashion. To him, foster care was a port in the storm, after a horrific upbringing seemed to map out a terrible life that could only end in two ways: jail or death. \n\n \n\nRevelations unfold with the patience and care they deserve, never for a moment hitting a false chord. What's more, they actually inform us about who these characters are. Every word, every moment has meaning, has real impact. What looks like a random party for Mason's parents becomes one of the affecting and touching scenes in the film, letting us in on exactly why he values honesty and family more than anything else. Mostly it's Jaden and Grace who gets the biggest breakthroughs, and like life they come when you least expect it. It's a true emotional roller coaster, one that comes with incredible highs and terrible lows. You'll laugh as Grace and Jaden beat up an inflatable dog as a means of therapy, or at Mason's lame attempts to be cool. You'll cry as one reveals a deeply-rooted personal tragedy, or when another slips into destructive habits. And then you'll probably cry tears of happiness at all of the little triumphs along the way. Ok, so it's a little crazy that so many events hit this one facility in the span of a few days, it never for a second feels less than authentic. Only at one time, when Grace goes a little nutso and begins taking matters into her own hands does Cretton go a bit overboard. While the actions Grace takes are probably consistent given her protective nature, it veers a little into \"wish fulfillment\" territory.\n\n \n\nLarson has always been a fantastic actress, who has stolen scenes in 21 Jump Street, The Spectacular Now, and in Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Don Jon, but her performance is the kind that careers are made of. It's a tough balancing act to portray a character like Grace, who is so tough and confident, yet fragile and scared at the same time. She captures the look of someone who has been through a lot and expects to go through a lot more, and will work tirelessly to make sure others don't have to endure the same. There's a wonderful, lived-in quality to all of the portrayals here, so much so that at times you may think you're watching a really well-made documentary.\n\n \n\nShort Term 12 has already amassed a number of awards on the festival circuit, and it deserves every single one. It deserves more, actually. It deserves to have some awards created specifically for it. As you might expect, there are no simple endings to this story, but the ending we do get is a hopeful and spirited one, and it may just have you looking at life with brighter eyes.",

            "content": "There are quite a few movies with teachers helping \"underprivileged kids,\" but the setting of this indie is more unique. The title refers to a short term foster home where teens supposedly stay until the court decides on more long term placement. Brie Larson is Grace, a young supervisor at Short Term 12. John Gallagher Jr. is Mason, one of Grace's co-workers and her boyfriend. Keith Stanfield, who also appeared in Cretton's short with the same name, is Marcus, one of the older teens who has had a longer stay at Short Term 12. Stanfield also recorded the rap for the closing credits. Kaitlyn Dever, who also appeared with Larson in The Spectacular Now as a fellow high school student, is Jayden, a new arrival to the home. Grace seems to function better when she is helping the teens with their problems rather than dealing with the emotional trauma of her own life. We get small glimpses of her background throughout, not through flashbacks, but when she shares stories that might help the teens. She is so compassionate and knowledgeable because she went through similar foster care. Mason, we find out, was also a foster kid, who was adopted by a loving family. Marcus is preparing to age out of the foster home. Jayden is dealing with abuse similar to what Grace experienced. Grace struggles with memories of her father at the same time as trying to decide if she should start a family with Mason. The leads and the few other supporting characters who are revealed a tiny bit form a well woven tapestry. It is emotional material that is delivered in a touching manner with lots of love and occasional laughs where appropriate.",

In school, there's always that one kid who constantly has trouble just getting by, and we feel for them, but that's about it.  \"Short Term 12\" is a movie about those kids - the ones who are neglected by their families, have troubled pasts, and long for a better life.\n\tShort Term 12 itself is a facility for at risk teens, with workers who were/are just as troubled as the teens they are attempting to save.  One of those dedicated workers is Grace (Brie Larson), a committed young woman who is great at understanding what the kids are going through (she had an abusive childhood), but at times uses the job to cover up her inner turmoil.\n\tShe's in love with her job, and also with Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), a colleague with whom she's had a long relationship with.  Grace's biggest problem, however, is the fact the relationship is beginning to look towards marriage territory, and her emotional past is getting in the way of forging such an endeavor.  \n\tThe film explores troubled youths in a way that hits much harder than we'd ever expect - it doesn't attempt to hone in on just one of them, but a handful, all of which have had things happen in their lives that no one should have to go through.  There are some scenes that could make anyone want to break down in tears: it's simply awful to see these kids have breakdowns when we know of so many that are born into homes that give them joy rather than pain.\n\tMany films of the same vein are cringe-worthy, showcasing outbursts of drama that follow the mold of a been-there-done-that clich√© instead of projecting honesty.  \"Short Term 12\" has many moments that beg to be glossily over-the-top, but thanks to its subtle performances and Cretton's understated direction, it's a film that feels like an all too realistic documentary.\n\tScenes flow not with Hollywood tinge, but with the normalcy of a day passing by, with moments of humor and disappointment intertwining with ease.  The dialogue is limited, but when it's on full display, it has a way of digging at us.\n\tAt the center of the film is Brie Larson, an actress who proves her buzz whole-heartedly.  As Grace, it isn't hard to witness her perpetual tug-of-war with her mind, completely aware that her life is in the process of turning out to be a damn good one, but simultaneously is being dragged down by the hardships of her early years.  Larson is gut-wrenching.  In some scenes, she shows Grace's abilities of fine care taking, while in others, displaying a sadness that makes our empathy rise to new levels.  She's a wonder, an actress who could easily go down the same route as Jennifer Lawrence.\n\t\"Short Term 12\" may not always be easy to watch, but it's so well-done in its unflinching ways that it still is extremely hard to look away.",

Here is the kind of dramatic indie feature that I can happily support, as it manages to hit a lot of familiar beats, while taking a step in a different direction from the norm.  The film features a strong lead performance by Brie Larson, some solid support from both the adult and younger actors involved, and this is all achieved with a certain level of comfort that allows the film to feel at many times like a docu-drama.  The sense of realism is there, but writer/director Destin Cretton does a lot of good work making a fully realized motion picture out of this story adapted from his own short film.  It will only have a limited release in theaters, but it definitely deserves a large audience.\n\nread the whole review at thecodeiszeek.com",

This is, without doubt, the most emotionally riveting story I have ever seen captured on camera. Around halfway through, I honestly wasn't sure what I was going to think about this movie once the credits rolled. The emotion was more real than I've ever seen before, but the story felt disjointed and the direction somewhat sloppy... But once the credits actually rolled, I was blown away. Never before have I cried as many times during a film as I did during Short Term 12. The seemingly disjointed first half of the movie ended up making perfect sense once the film had ended. Every scene, every conversation was essential to the message and the story being told. The acting was, in my opinion, the only weakness of this film; but in many ways, the offbeat performances added emotion and honesty to the roles. There is so much to be taken away from this movie that I don't know where to start. Bottom line, this is the best movie of the year (so far) and one of the best films I've ever seen.

Everything I'd been fearing about growing up and moving on has begun to take shape, and I feel like my life now is supposed to mean something, but I'm not sure what. I have the most amazing parents in the world, three beautiful siblings who love and would die for me in an instant and I them. I live a modest life that not only caters my obsession with film but allows me to discuss/vehemently defend movies and other various pieces of pop culture with equally strident individuals I've come to know as not strictly peers, but friends I feel I can be real with about anything when I don't have anywhere else to go (Mark Zuckerberg, I promise you.)\n\nThis prelude isn't to relate my troubles to the serious cases of abuse drug-affiliated and/or domestic of teens who enter into halfway housing. Again, a day doesn't go by where I don't stop and thank my lucky stars I was blessed or whatever enough to end up in the situation I am; I just put pressure upon myself that I'm not succeeding/trying hard enough to make it up to my parents for raising me to be the, I'd say kind and decent and unable-to-accept-any-form-of-flattery person I am today. I want to say I emotionally sympathize with struggling youth who also see the outside world as a big and scary place that's fit to swallow you whole, but at the end of the day, it physically isn't the environment from which I come.\n\nWhen Nelson Mandela died last month, I wrote a brief something on Facebook in quasi-memorial to his passing about how much I appreciate the people in this world who sacrifice their lives in pursuit of making it a little bit of a better place than it was before. One of the many delusions I mentally wrestle with is the metaphysical marriage between art and activism. Both try to relate universal truths about moral- and humanity. Art requires a willing audience though, a third man; activism puts you right in the shit and hands you a mop. Do we need more writers or poets in the mainstream any more than we need more lawyers or business executives? I'm not saying talent isn't too indelible a thing to waste and act like I don't seek out and let form a personal connection to emerging musical acts and bands. This divide is just something that fascinates me.\n\nI've said this somewhere previously, but I call bullshit on movies being about escapism. No amount of metallic clank and CGI clobber can shrug off story having to mean something; ANYTHING. The best works of art get at larger points of society and/or the plight of the singular spirit, blending fact and fiction to the degree the lines blur, stop making sense, give up the ghost or whatever your cheeky not-so-critical reference.\n\nAs you've probably made like Jennifer and garnered if anyone's even read this far (that last pun was most likely also the last straw) I didn't want to write a quote-unquote \"professional\" review of Destin Cretton's phenomenal \"Short Term 12\"; I've been waiting to see this movie for so many months now you can find troves of those anywhere. But just how much \"Short Term\" spoke to my sensibilities should be enough of a reason to warrant an immediate recommendation. Or if you're still on the fence, take Vampire Weekend's word for it -- no spoilers, the lyric \"all you who change your stripes can wrap me in the flag\" has never been more apt or literal. You'll know what I mean.\n\nAlso JGL, I loved \"Don Jon\", but nobody puts Brie Larson in the corner. Nobody. (89.100)",

Brie Larson, who is one of my new favorites, gives a wonderful performance that should have gotten her nominated for an Oscar. Unfortunately this is a little known gem. This film had a gritty and realistic aspect that I could relate to, because its director and writer Destin Daniel Cretton hails from San Diego. He does not shy away from the tough issues, but he also shows  a moving and beautiful flip side to this story. Short Term 12 can be hard to watch at times but it seems that what it really depicts is reality for many young people.",

This extension of the short film of the same name delves deep into the lives of social workers and the neglected youths  in a short term facility outside of San Francisco.

He once worked at a facility like the one portrayed in the film, and that definitely shows through the way he is able to create characters that feel like real human beings, dealing with real life problems. Brie Larson, giving the best performance of her career by far, plays Grace, who works at Short Term 12, and doesn't hesitate to risk her job and oftentimes physical well-being to support and protect the kids she is responsible for looking after. Her troubled past is slowly revealed throughout the film, mainly by her interactions with the kids residing at Short Term 12. Her boyfriend, played by John Gallagher Jr. (Jim Harper from The Newsroom) is clearly passionate about his job, and like Grace, genuinely cares about these kids. He wants to help them in any way he can, even if it's just sitting there listening to a teenager express their disturbing childhood through rap. This film is as much a character study, as it is an examination of the the roles people play in each others lives. Grace and Mason need those kids just as much the kids need them, and the authenticity of both the characters, and place, make for one of the better independent films I've seen this year.",
