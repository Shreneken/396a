His calmness under extreme pressure was captivating but the ability to have that all crumble down once it is over was just, perfect. His raw portrayal of trauma was one of the most impressive feats of acting I've ever seen. For a nearly two and a half hour runtime, this movie was paced very well, filled with tension throughout. I was holding my breath in so many scenes as the pirates were within a foot of catching a crew mate or as they were creeping closer and closer in their small boarding boat. This constant tension mixed with a fantastic script and story left me glued to my screen for its entirety.\n\nScore: 89%\nVerdict: Excellent",

The tone is well maintained throughout, intensifying when needed, easing back as the events calmed and settled, then surging back up to its most heated moments as the navy forces close in and situations gets to their worst.\nHanks gives a fine performance as the title character, but his last scene, with him in a state of shock and uncertainty in the face of his apparent rescue, is stellar work. Barkhadi Abdi is remarkable as the pirate captain who has to juggle the effort to gain the money they're after, the hair trigger anger of one of his fellow pirates, and the general chaos of it all.\nSolid performances in general by those in support roles. Good choices by editor Rouse and a tight screenplay by Billy Ray.",

It's A Thriller You Must See, and Once You Have, You've Experienced Golden Cinema. \n\nNava Medikonda | 4.5/5 | 90%\n\nThe Survival Story follows Captain Richard Phillips(Tom Hanks) as the main character, abroad a cargo ship carrying several crates traveling across international waters. Phillips, and his entire crew are put through a disaster they didn't expect entirely would turn into reality.\n\nThe 2013 film was directed by Paul Greengrass, a qualified and known director for his thrilling Bourne Films(Jason Bourn as Matt Damon). His style carried right over to \"Captain Phillips\" and the anxiety is detectible, you can feel it right till the very end. \n\n\"Captain Phillips\" starts off slow, and we feel its another movie that isn't going to be fun, or exciting in any way, until the action kicks in.\n\nThe action brings stress to the characters, and brings anxiety to the viewer putting them on edge. You start to feel tense, and restless. This film does an amazing job with its giving the viewer anxiety until the end. Similar to filmmakers The Safdie Brothers who have directed films \"Uncut Gems\" and \"Good Time\" both films giving the viewer anxiety instantly feels the same way with \"Captain Phillips.\" \n\nThe enemy's in the film are Muse(Barkhad Abdi) and his crew of pirates. Bilal(Barkhad Abdirahman), Najee(Faysal Ahmed), and Elmi(Mahat M. Ali), who hijack the MV Maersk Alabama Cargo Ship, also seen in the trailer. \n\nThe performance by every actor/actress in the film is shocking. Everybody portrays their roles perfectly, to the crew members, to the captain, to the pirates, nobody has a flaw, everything feels real, everything feels legit, it helps and allows the audience feel involved in the story, involved like they're sitting right in front of the action. \n\nThe film was shot using 16mm film, and has a runtime of 2 hours and 14 minutes, and has a rating of PG-13. \n\nFrom the beginning when the film brings us in, we only feel satisfied once it ends. As a viewer, our heart rate, and our focus does steady down. At the end of the day, we understand that all these people, based on the true story, are all just humans and people, especially Captain Richard Phillips himself.",

            "content": "Although it was very positively reviewed and Tom Hanks and Paul Greengrass have done some great films in their respective careers, there was the uncertainty as to whether 'Captain Phillips' would be my cup of tea.\n\nThe good news is it very much was. Although it does stray from the facts quite a bit, 'Captain Phillips' takes a remarkable and harrowing true story and tells it in a way that's utterly gripping and full of tension and emotion. It won't be for all taste-buds, especially for those who don't like shaky cam, but it is very easy to see why 'Captain Phillips' was and still is received so positively. It's not quite a masterpiece or flawless, it does go on a little longer than necessary which occasionally bogs down the pacing (15-20 minutes shorter would have made a difference) and, although there has been far worse abuse of the shaky cam technique, some of it does get excessive and leaves one feel a little sea-sick.\n\nHowever, 'Captain Phillips' does more right than it does wrong and boasts some of Greengrass's best directing in one of his best films and one of Hanks' best performances in recent years. Greengrass keeps the tension levels high, maintaining urgency and the more violent moments are explosively powerful. He is particularly good in showing the increasing desperation when things go wrong as well as the horrors of the situation. Hanks is at the height of his powers here, boasting some of the most powerful acting he has ever given, particularly in his very poignant final scenes.\n\nOne mustn't overlook Barkhad Abdi, who brings intensity and vulnerability to a character who seems like a villain at first but turns out to be much more than that. The rest of the acting is fine, though Hanks and Abdi are the ones that dominate.\n\n'Captain Phillips' is well made, while some of it is excessive there are other instances where the shaky cam heightens the drama and dizzying intensity. There is an audacious grit throughout. The music pulsates thrillingly without being repetitive or overbearing. The script is thought-provoking and has tightness and also nuance that stops things from being patronising.\n\nStory-wise, 'Captain Phillips' is riveting, there is a heart-pumping urgency throughout and the tension, claustrophobia and desperation escalates and increases to nerve-shredding effect in its best moments. The emotion of the final act crescendos thrillingly and heart-wrenchingly and it is enough to bring tears to the eyes. So much its honesty, pathos and power, Hanks gives it everything to these scenes. The characters are hardly neatly black and white while motivations and character decisions are clear and logical.\n\nIn conclusion, tense and powerful, highly recommended. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The fact that the shooting of three Somalis is celebrated through the tone and score of the final segment is just an atrocious representation of where American perspectives stand.

What makes the story so gripping, other than the compelling story and the expertise with which it is presented, is the fact that the characters are so human.  Tom Hanks does a great job as Phillips, but the true star is Barkhad Abdi as the leader of the Somali pirates, who somehow makes an inhumane character human.",

            "content": "I haven't seen a movie as good as this one in a long time. This film really puts you on the edge of your seat and you lose track of time. ‘Captain Phillips' directed by Paul Greengass, is an American biographical action thriller. This movie was released in 2013 and is originally a story from Richard Phillips. \n\nIn these types of films, you often see that the story is long-winded and one-sided. But that is certainly not the case here. The director Greengrass presents Tom Hanks as the main character. He presents this character and builds a kind of bond with the viewer. This connection creates many emotions by the viewer. The other characters such as the pirates are also very well portrayed. They are not the typical bad guys like in many films. They are shown as real people with feelings, motives and dreams. Greengrass shows viewers the story from two perspectives: through the eyes of Phillips, who wants to save his crew and himself and through the eyes of Muse, the ship's hijacker.\n\nCaptain Phillips takes command of a Maersk containership that he must bring safely to Mombasa. Once he looks at the route, he starts to prepare a bit for possible pirates. This allows the crew to practice various safety protocols. During one of these exercises the captain sees two unknown boats appear on his radar. With his binoculars he sees that they are heavily armed Somali pirates. It was at that moment that he knew it was going to be serious and that it was not a game. Later in the movie, even the US Navy comes to help.\n\nThe film is quietly constructed, presenting the lives of the captain and the Somali pirates. After this quiet start, the tension builds up. Every minute it gets more excited. This means there is no boredom through the entire movie. The only downside I see in this movie is that the fellow pirates in some scenes were a bit too chaotic and noisy, but that can also be doubt because this can also evoke extra emotion and take you even more into the story.\n\nEveryone knows that Tom Hanks can act very well. But in this film he shows that he is certainly one of the best. His roles in movies like Forrest Gump or The Green Mile are iconic and it's hard to imagine they could be played by any other actor. Also the leader of the pirates, acted by Barkhad Abdi, certainly deserves appreciation for his role.\n\nOverall I think it is a very good movie that brings a lot of emotion and tension with it. The actors and the director did very well. I would recommend this film to people who like exciting and realistic films. It is a film you will not soon forget!\n\nExtra information:\n\nRelease date: September the 27th , 2013\nBased on: a book called \"A Captian's Duty\" by   \nRichard Phillips\nRunning time: 2 hours and 14 minutes\nDistributed by: Sony Pictures Realeasing",

            "content": "Nothing about the premise of this male driven, action heavy film excited me and I have to say that in watching the film it fulfilled every expectation I had and by that I mean it was a dreadful bore. Paul Greengrass is a filmmaker championed by those who enjoy nutty action thrillers such as The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and Green Zone (2010) but I have never found myself quite as enraptured with his filmmaking style as others are. I wish I had not dedicated over two hours of my life to this film and I was surprised by the fact that this managed to receive a Best Picture nomination when it is a disappointment in so many ways.\n\nMiddle aged sailor Captain Richard Phillips, Tom Hanks, leads a group of sailors bringing supplies from Oman to Mombasa, Kenya aboard the Maersk Alabama container ship. He encounters a major problem when Somali pirates begin chasing the ship and their determined, violent leader Abduwali Muse, Barkhad Abdi, pushes his men to continue chasing them despite Phillips requesting the help of the United States military. The pirates eventually make their way aboard and shoot several of the sailors aboard. Phillips manages to keep calm and attempts to control the situation and keep his men safe but the nervous and overzealous Muse is quick to attack and ends up having one of his own men injured due to quick and careless decision making. Phillips is able to quietly and surreptitiously deal with issues aboard but when he is forced into a lifeboat by Muse and held captive in exchange for money from the United States military he begins to panic. The military surround the lifeboat and with typical strategic brilliance they get Phillips out of harm's way but he is clearly shaken by his experiences as is a defeated Muse.\n\nOne thing that the film has going for it is Hanks who reminds everybody why he has been a consistently successful leading man since the late 1980s. He is naturally likable and from the moment we see him, bespectacled with a ‘dad bod', we are behind him and have the desire to see him succeed. Many of us undervalue actors who make nice, regular men interesting to watch on screen and because Hanks has done this so successfully so many times it is easy to undervalue him as a one trick pony. This is not true as he subtly imbues his character with a sense of decency and goodness that is not expressed through words but through small gestures and actions. He totally embodies Phillips and we see a normal man fighting for his life instead of a movie star ‘suffering' as many actors would have appeared. Although the film is over long, Hanks is always captivating and his magnetism made me more forgiving of some of the film's major flaws.\n\nIn speaking of the flaws of the film there are many as it does stretch out a relatively thin story for far too long and all of the characters other than Phillips seem like caricatures. Abdi received an Academy Award nomination for his performance and while he excels at loud and chaotic he doesn't display quite enough depth in the moments where he is meant to have us sympathize with his character. Most bleeding heart liberal viewers will be compelled to care for the poor, struggling pirates more than the wealthy, privileged American but for a less liberally inclined viewer it was hard to feel for these violent thugs with just a few lines of dialogue to add some dimension to them. Greengrass would have done better to either turn them into the over the top, campy villains that work in films such as Face/Off (1997) or to have tried to make a more complex, character based drama.\n\nI will admit that some of my dislike of the film comes from the fact that I am not the biggest fan of action films and generally find chase scenes and violence uninteresting. I am sure that Greengrass did a fantastic job at choreographing some suspenseful scenes of action to audiences who enjoy that sort of fodder but this content left me cold. I needed something more to keep me invested and the film never quite provided that.",

Paul Greengrass gets it right again; everything is up to the mark, brilliant execution, perfect editing and gripping screenplay.

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Greg, after Castaway you d think Tom Hanks would have had enough of movies involving mishaps in tropical waters.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) In all seriousness, Hanks delivers the goods in Captain Phillips.\n\nSCOTT: Lets recap. Tom Hanks plays the role of Richard Phillips, the captain of an American tanker ship carrying goods off the coast of Africa. His ship is boarded by several Somali pirates, led by their captain named Muse (Barkhad Abdi).\n\nGREG: Despite his best efforts, Phillips can t keep the pirates off his ship. His crew hide below decks. The Somalis search for them but to no avail. The crew take Muse captive in exchange for Phillips. But Phillips makes a critical error and gets into the lifeboat with the Somali pirates. Now it s a race against time as the pirates make way for the Somali coast while the Navy and their SEALS prepare to intercept.\n\nSCOTT: Captain Phillips is based on a true story, and as such we pretty much know the ending of Phillips  ordeal before the movie even begins. As such, this film faces the challenge of taking a predictable situation and somehow making it interesting to viewers. This isn t easy, yet Captain Phillips succeeds on many levels. The movie works because of strong performances from the entire cast along with some tight, taut directing from Paul Greengrass.\n\nGREG: It is pretty hair-raising to watch. Scott, by some measures Phillips is a hero, but by another not so much. In our analysis of hero stories we usually look for transformation - either in the main character or in those around him. In Captain Phillips there is no such transformation. Everyone ends up pretty much the way they started. However, if we apply the  Great Eight Characteristics  of a hero as outlined in your book Heroes: What They Are and Why We Need Them, Tom Hank s Captain Phillips does pretty well.\n\nSCOTT: Yes, he does, Greg. Phillips is smart, as shown by the way he manipulates the pirates after they board his ship. He s strong, obviously, to be able to survive such an ordeal. He s selfless in his concerns for his crew over his own well-being. He s also reliable, caring, and inspiring. That s most of the Great Eight right there. One of the best qualities of this movie is it s attention to detail and it s willingness to show scenes that most movies leave on the cutting room floor. For example, one of the most powerful scenes in the movie occurs, ironically, once all the dust has settled and Phillips has been rescued. Most movies end at that point and we assume a nice joyful recovery for our hero. But this movie dares to show us how Phillips is most definitely NOT okay after his harrowing experience. He s a psychological mess as the navy personnel clean him up. This took guts to show and made me admire the makers of Captain Phillips even more.\n\nGREG: Another thing that I thought was well-done is the presentation of the pirates themselves. They weren t an organized group. There was dissention among them. One was a youngster - very inexperienced. Another didn t have faith in Muse, constantly contradicting him at every turn. The scenes of the pirates inside the enclosed life boat offered a look into the desperation of the Somali people. These men had no choice but to come home with something they could ransom - or face death.\n\nSCOTT: I agree, Greg. The portrayal of the pirates was handled very well. Yes, they are committing a terrible crime, but we also see the grim conditions in Somalia that can give rise to such desperate behavior. I also applaud the fact that the pirates have very distinctly different personalities. I m reminded of Rambo movies from yesteryear where the bad guys are portrayed as a monolithic pestulence. Here we have real people making both good and bad choices that have life and death consequences. It s riveting and powerful. Captain Phillips is a highly effective movie that is deftly made and saturated in suspense. I give it 4 Reels out of 5. The hero story is done well, too. Phillips is faced with many, but not all, of the classic people, tests, and trials of the hero journey. Tom Hanks once again shows why he s the greatest American actor of his generation. He steals the show yet manages to share the stage generously with a great ensemble of actors. I award his character 4 Heroes out of 5. Movie:  Hero: \n\nGREG: I think we re in agreement here, Scott. It is a powerful story and enjoyable to watch. We walk away with a sense of what the Somali pirates are up against in their daily lives and the lengths they must go to just to survive. We also get a look at what it takes to be a captain of a modern cargo vessel. But I have to wonder if Phillips is truly heroic. He makes some bad decisions: like being outside the commonly travelled waters and getting into the lifeboat. But once he finds himself in a bad situation, he puts the safety of his crew first above all else. I give Captain Phillips 4 Reels out of 5 and 4 Heroes out of 5. Movie:  Hero:",

            "content": "Captain Phillips is directed by Paul Greengrass, and it stars Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi in a biographical survival thriller film about a bunch of Somali pirates going over to Captain Phillips's ship take over and hold for ransom, and takes Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) as hostage in a lifeboat with the pirates. I've seen Paul Greengrass's work on films like United 93 and the Bourne sequels that has Matt Damon involved in it, and I remember enjoying them. So I was looking forward to this film, and I really enjoyed it a lot. Tom Hanks gave a wonderful performance to this, and he's a great choice for the main character as he looks a bit like him and that he's always a talent to be with. The actors who played the pirates were fantastic too as it's their first acting role, and the fact that they have to be intimidating against Tom Hanks and succeed, is really something. It does take its time with the hijack, which is good as you don't whether that'll be the time for it or not as their were some moments where the pirates attempted to hijack the ship. The movie gets really tense whether it be the attempted hijacking, or being in a lifeboat with a gun to Phillips's head. The writing by Billy Ray is really good at showing both sides of what they have to go through to be in the situation, and enough characterization of the main character and the leader of the pirate that you want the main character to get out of the situation and understand what leader is going through which you probably feel a bit pity for them. The last minutes of the film really shines in terms of Tom Hank's career that you've seen one of his best moments, while also giving a fantastic emotionless performance from Danielle Albert that has a reason why she acted like that if you've seen the film. The only issue that I have with it, is that the middle can be a bit boring at times, but that's me trying to find problems with it as I really enjoyed Captain Phillips for the way it's shotted in a bit of a documentary style, great acting, and is really smart that is one of Paul Greengrass's greats.",

            "content": "Movies based on real life stories have intrigued many an audience over the years; they bring strong realism and often provide a different perspective to an already well known event. Director Paul Greengrass is no stranger to this style of filmmaking and he returns to direct another solid and wholly believable account of one sailor's struggle for survival.\n\nCaptain Phillips is a biopic about the titular captain's deadly ordeal after his ship is invaded by Somalia pirates led by a younger man named Muse who seeks to prove himself to his fellow companions. The film wastes no time in reaching its main plotline; after short and snappy introductions to the opposing forces involved in the incident the audience is catapulted straight into the action and from there things grow more tense by the minute as the captain is put in greater danger and the military intervenes. Tensions of both the pirate and militaristic kind reach a fever pitch in the final act as the two sides desperately attempt to negotiate with Phillips caught in the middle of it all. Intensity is in no short supply throughout ''Captain Phillips'' which keeps the audience utterly invested throughout the film.\n\nWith a title like ''Captain Phillips'' it's imperative that the movie focuses on its main role and it does not disappoint; Tom Hanks delivers yet another multi-faceted, highly emotional performance that truly puts the audience into the character's perspective. On the one hand Phillips displays great bravery and calmness for his crew in the face of dangerous assailants but later begins to question his fate; when he breaks down at the thought of dying at the hands of the ruthless pirates you feel the immense fear that grips the Captain through his struggle. The other members of the cast are much lesser in scope but are suited to the minor roles they play; despite not sharing much screen time the rest of the twenty man crew aboard the Alabama show a strong camaraderie and are just as capable in their archetypes as sailors who are thrust into an impossible situation. The military forces involved in the action are also well acted, re-enacting a hostage situation just it had in real life several years ago whereas the pirates are also simple yet they have characteristics that set them apart. Muse is the uncompromising leader, Bilal is strong and more aggressive, and Najee is the youngest of the group who may still have part of a conscience despite participating in piracy. Authenticity is the jewel in the casting of ''Captain Phillips'', a focus that is maintained through all other aspects of the film.\n\nThe technical effects used in Captain Phillips are highly practical, building up more realism to an already authentic film, several wide view shots work brilliantly at highlighting the scale of the both the huge Alabama liner and the smaller skiffs used by the pirates. A minimal use of computer generated effects for shots of the liner's propellers never overstay their welcome and for this film Greengrass seems to have let go of the shaky and somewhat nauseating camera angles that plagued the Bourne movies which goes a long way to make sure the action is fully in view at all times. The music is perfectly suited to the action, rising and falling seamlessly to fit the breakneck pacing of the film. Overall the technical presentation of ''Captain Phillips'' makes just as big an impression as the acting on display.\n\nCaptain Phillips can stand tall among the best films of the year; it's incredibly authentic, nail-bitingly tense and with a stellar performance from Tom Hanks, it puts itself over the top to be another excellent effort from Greengrass.",

            "content": "SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\n\"Look at me. I am the captain now.\"\n\nHaving just watched this for the first time recently, this movie was far more powerful, emotional, and suspenseful than I was expecting. However, once I realized that the director was Paul Greengrass (who had previously done some of the Bourne films and is scheduled to return for the fifth one this summer), I wasn't as surprised. He takes a lot of the high-stakes style storytelling from those action movies, and transplants them into this life-or-death drama. This movie was one of the biggest emotional rollercoasters that a film has sent me on in quite some time. Prior to watching this, I actually knew that Captain Phillips was going to survive, being somewhat familiar with the true story that this film was based  on, yet I still was on the edge of my seat with anticipation of what would happen next.\n\nOne of the many reasons that this film works so well is the superb acting. Tom Hanks gives yet another stellar \"I'm in an impossible situation, but I'm going to pull through\" performance that I would say is on par with his role in Apollo 13. If this movie can't convince you that Tom Hanks is one of the best living actors, I don't know what will. One of my favorite things about this performance is how he made the character feel real - at first, he almost seemed a little stuffy and unlikable (kind of like an annoying boss who seems to think that one should have absolutely zero fun while on the clock, even if you're still being productive). Yet as the movie progressed, we got to see that he is courageous and genuinely cares about the safety of his crew. This seemed like a true-to-life reminder that just because someone rubs you the wrong way initially, it doesn't mean that they are devoid of good qualities.\n\nBarkhad Abdi, who plays the main pirate Muse, also delivered a spectacular performance. It comes as no surprise to me that he was nominated for an Oscar for this role. Rather than just being a two-dimensional villain for the sake of villainy, I really felt this character's unyielding determination to prove himself. Had this been a superhero or crime film, I felt that he would have been a similarly well-developed character that you would typically go on to see becoming a terrifying crime boss, like Fisk from Netflix's Daredevil.\n\nI also enjoy the performance from Barkhad Abdirahman, who plays the young pirate Bilal. Largely because of his portrayal, I was actually quite sad that his character died. It was obvious that while he made a poor choice and had to be accountable for his actions, he was also a product of his circumstances. It made you wish he had a better chance at life. While Muse was definitely the complex and driven villain, Bilal was just as definitely the tragic villain who you wanted to turn good, and felt that his death was a tragedy.\n\nBeing a huge sci-fi fan that I am (especially of properties like Star Trek and Firefly) I love how this felt like it could have easily been some kind of adventure taking place on a damaged and stranded spaceship, and yet it took place in very real locations with very real conflicts. It also contained some themes that one often sees in superhero films - people in desperate situations that are willing to sacrifice themselves to save others (Phillips), as well as being rescued from nefarious individuals (the pirates) by other individuals with great power and resources (the Navy). Given, one could rightly say that sci-fi and superheroes appropriate these themes from real-world stories like this, but I feel like I see these themes used in the fantastical world of sci-fi far more frequently, and it was refreshing to see these story elements utilized in a grounded and real-world setting.\n\nLastly, I loved seeing this mind games that the characters played with each other (including Hanks, the pirates, and the Navy). For me, intellectual sparring can be just as compelling to watch as actual physical battles, and this movie was full of mental maneuvers. Despite the number of times various characters said \"No tricks!,\" there were plenty of tricks played by all.",

            "content": "What's with Tom Hanks being stranded in the sea and giving a stellar performance for a character to root for? An edge of the seat thriller defying the conventional runtime with a very strong antagonist character having layers of depth that even the Dark Knight's Joker could have a run for his money. While majority of today's action thrillers rely on massive set pieces, special effects, explosions etc, it is good to see a fulfilling raw human drama between very original characters.\n\nRichard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is your average captain of a merchant ship MV Maersk Alabama with a thinking cap and practical attitude. Muse(Barkhad Abdi) is a volatile young Somalian pirate with a devil-may-care attitude and lots of enthusiasm to out perform his peers. When Muse's hunt for prey encounters MV Maersk Alabama, the crew throws everything they have at the pirates to keep them at bay. but Muse's determination and the ship's under preparedness to handle such a situation leads to the capture. What stays in between is Phillips composure, perfect study of the situation (though initially) and his practicality.\n\nBarkhad Abdi is not your typical antagonist with his petite appearance and a not so captivating voice. But his unpredictability and a misplaced courage and stubbornness makes him more than difficult to handle. Tom Hanks shows his masterclass throughout the movie saving his best for the climax. Now what comes to mind about Paul Greengrass? The man who popularized the frantic camera movements and exhaustive editing skills that we have seen from 'Bloody Sunday' to the spectacular 'Bourne Ultimatum'. But he did show some promise towards handling complex human emotions in 'United 93' that does spillover to this one too. What works for the movie is its simplicity and for good or bad, doesn't lose focus from the main subjects like dealing with their back story or the perspective of their family. Which is similar to how it is done in another of this year's wonderfully done 'Gravity'. \n\nPowerful acting and a solid hand behind the camera delivers a first-class nail-biter .",

Phillips\" - Posted by Yorkshire on 3 November 2013, 9:07 pm\n\n    We all know the story, the MÆRSK Alabama (yes it's the Danish Spelling) is hijacked by Somali Pirates (who are played by Somali Americans from Minnesota and England) The standard bait and switch (tensely) is done. The Seals come in and shoot the bastards and the somali's get there virgins and Hanks go home. That is the basic story. But getting from A to B the movie keeps you guessing if it really happens.\n\nIn short, Somalis, those bastards, should all sit wherever and starve to death, and then it's OK. \n\nmore comments at: https://alessandrareflections.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/movie-capt-phillips-versus-the-somalian-bastards/",

            "content": "Movie magic happens when the right actor finds the right director. Jimmy Stewart was the perfect everyman to navigate the twisted worlds of Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers. In Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese found the ideal actor to bring his tough Italian leading men to the big screen. The list goes on and on-Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, the Coens and John Goodman, and more recently, Tarantino and Christoph Waltz.\n\nAdd Tom Hanks and Paul Greengrass to the list. It's an odd pairing, of course. The great humanist actor of his generation meets the man behind some of the most clinical and calculating dramas of the past decade-The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum, Green Zone, and especially United 93. But the end result-the taut high-seas thriller Captain Phillips-is hard to argue with. Hanks hasn't been this good in 20 years, and Greengrass' approach feels revitalized with real people and their beating hearts driving the action.\n\nCaptain Phillips is based on the true story of Richard Phillips (Hanks) who survived an attack by armed pirates on the container ship Maersk Alabama in 2009. Phillips and his crew of 20 or so were headed for Kenya from Oman when two small boats approached off the coast of Somalia. Phillips' craftiness disabled one and forced the other to turn around, but the next day, four young Somali men-led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi)-boarded the ship and demanded they get paid.\n\nThe rest of the film is a series of escalating cat-and-mouse games-the crew captures a pirate, the pirates escape in a lifeboat with Captain Phillips, the US navy traps the lifeboat. The whole thing is a story most are quite familiar with, so authentic suspense is hard to come by. Like Ben Affleck did with Argo, however, Greengrass milks tension out of nearly every frame. Because you care about Phillips-because Hanks so easily slips into the persona of John Q. Public-you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat throughout the film's intense but surprisingly breezy two hours.\n\nWhat's remarkable about Hanks' performance is how unique it is within his incredibly impressive filmography. He seems like a natural fit for the character, but what we see on screen isn't your average charming Hanks turn. This Phillips is a Greengrass creation-low-key and no-nonsense. Glimpses of humanity don't really come out until after the halfway point, when he's stuck on the lifeboat. But in the film's final 15 minutes, any preconceptions we had about the character (and about Hanks as an actor, really) crash and burn in a series of increasingly heartbreaking moments.\n\nHanks' performance is nearly matched-if not in number of big moments than certainly in overall quality-by that of newcomer Barkhad Abdi. His Muse gives the film subtext that raises it above your average procedural or heroic thriller. He proclaims himself a businessman to Captain Phillips upon their meeting. He also labels himself a simple fisherman to navy negotiators. No one is really buying what this guy is selling, and he too knows it's mostly bullshit. But when Phillips tells him there must be something else he can do besides hijack ships at gunpoint for a living, he answers plainly, \"Maybe in America.\" In that moment, these two opponents understand each other, and we come closer to understanding Muse. Abdi walks such a fine line between unequivocally villainous and tragic/sympathetic without really falling 100% on either side of the line. It's a thing of beauty to watch, and all the more impressive coming from a first-time actor.\n\nBilly Ray (of Shattered Glass and Breach fame) penned Captain Phillips' economic screenplay, and Christopher Rouse damn near edits it to perfection. Henry Jackman's score gets your blood pumping without ever feeling overly intrusive, and Barry Ackroyd's cinemtographic contributions can't be understated-the sense of scale he gives the film by choosing the right angles and shot distances is essential.\n\nCaptain Phillips opens with as simple a scene as you'll find in a movie this year-a husband and wife (Catherine Keener) drive to the airport. They discuss their children's lives, their fears for the future, and before departing, she wishes him a safe trip. It seems so unremarkable, but it is the film. It's Phillips' motivation to endure. It's Ray's first tension-filled stroke of the pen. It's a way to orient yourself to Greengrass' seemingly patented handheld, close-up style. It's the first taste we get of the film's \"economies of scale\" themes.\n\nAnd it's our introduction to our hero as an ordinary guy, which is ultimately what I'll remember Captain Phillips for the most-for Hanks' towering performance and for the way Greengrass and company, through images and sound, made me feel his plight.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/captain-phillips-review/",

And though I've always enjoyed most films starring Tom Hanks, he really raises his acting game here and my hitherto average view of him as an actor went up based on this performance alone.\n\nOn my first viewing I was completely engaged and on the edge of my seat, from start to finish, as I was unsure how this (inspired) true story unfolded for the crew on board the Maersk Alabama. And to Greengrasses' credit, I believe he keeps this one relatively close to the events that actually took. Without giving anything away, I was especially amazed to learn that the film's conclusion was so accurately reproduced as to how the events themselves took place. Top marks. 5/5",

Barkhad Abdi does a brilliant and layered performance as the Somali pirate who deep down doesn't want to be here. But the real find is Barkhadin Abdirahman, who plays Balil, the teenager who comes along feeling like he has to prove himself.

It's perhaps 10-15 minutes too long, but that mostly serves to keep the tension building through the last act, as the US Navy get involved and the pirates become more desperate and volatile.

Many of us who remember following the news of the 2009 hijacking of the commercial ship Maersk Alabama and the kidnapping of its captain may also remember thinking how the saga played out much like a movie. Then, 2013 gave us \"Captain Phillips\" (PG-13, 2:14). Of course, there's much more to the story than those news reports were able to tell us at the time.  A quick internet search would give you the history of this event, but I'll still restrict myself to just setting up the plot, as I'd do in any other review, in case you want to see the story unfold as if for the first time.\n\nRichard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is the Maersk Alabama's wise and experienced captain, guiding his cargo ship down the coast of eastern Africa when the vessel is attacked by Somali pirates. Phillips knows that these are dangerous waters and even has his crew drill and prepare for a potential piracy situation, but no one on the ship imagines that it will actually happen to them. When it does, both captain and crew show bravery, resourcefulness and smarts that stymie the pirates' plan to hold the ship for ransom. This leads the pirates to use the ship's enclosed life boat to get away, but with Captain Phillips as their hostage. This sets up a race against time with the U.S. Navy working to save Captain Phillips before the pirates can get him back to Somalia and ransom him to secure the payoff that they feel is their due.\n\nEverything about this film is superb. Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his impressive career. Every fear, every calculation, every bit of pain is etched across his face, while his righteous defiance undergirds it all. The pirates are played by four Americans (and real-life friends) of Somali descent (impressively led by Barkhad Abdi) and are all first-time actors. Still, they imbue their characters with an authenticity that makes us fear them and a humanity that stops short of making us sympathize with them, but helps us understand them. Paul Greengrass (who also directed the 2nd and 3rd movies in the \"Bourne\" franchise and the underrated \"United 93\") again shows that he's a master of tension and pacing. He makes this story fascinating to watch, even if you remember what happened during those four dramatic days. \"A\"",

Note their may be spoilers so if you have not seen it (which your should) watch it it's a masterpiece of work even though it has a lot of killing \n\n\nCaptain Tom hanks is about this father that goes to a cargo ship which he the captain to go to Africa its somewhere on the east I'm not sure, anyway Tom hanks crew get invaded by pirates as they call them (muse) is the captain of the Pirates. Muse is from a poor place with his other crew members they plain to go and get the cargo ship and get money. Tom hanks get kidnapped by the muse and the crew trow him in a life boat and they all go. Meanwhile the navi finds out about this and try to take Tom hanks back home. \n\nThis film, it's not for kids at all so wait till their older to watch it and I'm an adult an I got even scared and also it's based on a true story. \n\nTom hanks needs more than woody he so good that I would give him a job by just watching 5 minutes in to the movie. And give him a job. \n\nNow when I think about Tom hanks doing a Toy story 4 it's unnecessary he needs more like this. \n\nHis Phillips character shows that he cares about his family his friends. He was crying in the end of the movie well of corse because he was tortured by muse and his gang. \n\nTheir where some parts that made me chuckle and if that didn't happen I would give this a 5/5 the reason it's supposed to be a serious problem one part was when (this is a spoiler) when the navy kill muse three friends when almost killing Tom hanks at the right moment the navy kill the three of muse people. Muse was on the navy boat already. 2 minutes later Tom screams seeing muse friends all dead with blood all over him and he does a scream that made me chuckle I wish they fixed that.\n\n\nI give this movie 4/5 with awesome story telling, awesome acting, character development, tenses when it needed to be \n\nThis is QR and I will see you next time \n\nThe movie is really good by showing the characters real background",

Hanks plays the role believably and perfectly. He has the lives of his crew in his hands and manages to act calmly and bravely for them, despite dealing with pirates aiming guns at his face. \n\nThe pirates themselves are also good actors. I actually forgot I was watching a movie and it felt like someone had placed a camera on this small little boat they were in. Great pacing, acting, and characters.

            "content": "\"Captain Phillips\" is a cold-water treatment for anyone who regards pirates solely based on what they see at the movies - or on the internet for that matter.  If your mental imagery of high seas plunderers begins and ends with Jack Sparrow, then you're in for a shock when director Paul Greengrass puts his arm around your shoulder and shows you - in cold, spare detail - how it works in the real world.\n\nThe story of \"Captain Phillips\" is based on the 2009 attempted high jacking of the cargo ship MV Maersk Alabama, 200 miles off the coast of Somalia, and the subsequent kidnapping of merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks).  Little time is wasted on getting things rolling.  We are hardly 20 minutes into the film when the pirates, driving two skiff boats, begin closing in on the ship which they choose because it is the only ship in the region that isn't sailing close to another ship.  Greengrass bypasses a lot of introductory scenes in an attempt to keep the story lean and spare.  He establishes only that Phillips has a wife (Catherine Keener) and that the Somalis banded their pirate crew together early that morning on the beach, like employers looking for day laborers.  After that, the movie is full-steam ahead into a white-knuckle thriller that Greengrass is able to keep tense even when we know how it ends.\n\nThe scenes of the takeover are laid out with scary precision.  The Alabama attempts to subvert the takeover by first outrunning and then out-maneuvering the skiff.  The action is presented with such dramatic tension that we begin to think, for a moment, that the Alabama might be able to avoid the takeover.   That, of course, is not the truth.  The ship is boarded by four young Somali men who are skinny, frightened and waving machine guns.\n\nWe learn only what we need to know about the characters.  Phillips is shown as a man of experience, who is able to improvise at crucial moments.  Hanks downplays his performance by making it mostly reactionary.  He doesn't pose for effect, but simply plays to the moment.  He saves his one huge emotional moment for last.  Hanks is an actor who is as familiar to us as a favorite cousin, and after 33 years of acting in professional films, we think that we might have seen everything that his acting arsenal might have to offer.  He has a moment in this film of near-emotional meltdown that is startling.  It is a moment that, up until now, this fine actor has never been able to display.\n\nThe pirates themselves redefine the words \"rag-tag.\"  There are only four men left when the hijack actually happens - several others abandoned the mission.  At first they seem like movie types:  There's a hard-eyed leader, a hot-head, a scared kid, and one guy who might be mistaken for having a soul.  They have a goal in mind, but these are not professional criminals.  They are scared, violent and hard-headed.  Early and often, they make stupid mistakes because, determined as they are, they're not exactly brainiacs.\n\nMost of their focus comes from the leader, Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Adbi) who earns no sympathy even when he tells Phillips his reasons for taking the ship - he, like, Phillips, has people to answer to.  Adbi is an untrained actor making his film debut and is already earning buzz as a possible Oscar contender.  It might be well earned.  He doesn't play Muse as irrational.  There's something in his eyes that tells us that he is determined to take this crisis to a tragic end.  We actually begin to believe that in other circumstances, he could make an effective leader - or a fearsome warlord.\n\nGreengrass keeps the film lean and sharp.  He builds tension, not out of phony manipulation, but based on circumstance and fact.  He's an old hat at this kind of thing.  He previously directed \"Bloody Sunday\", about the 1972 Irish civil rights march and subsequent massacre by British troops.  He also made the brilliant \"United 93\" about the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania on September 11th.\n\nHe's a craftsman who knows how to stage a real-life action scenes without pumping it full of phony drama.  He sticks to the moment.  \"Captain Phillips\" is a very well-made recreation of a real-life event.  What it does it does very well.  It doesn't have much meaning beyond itself, however.  It is an incident that happened in real life, but there are not a lot of personal details.  Once it's over you're only left with a great thriller.  As with \"United 93,\" (which was my favorite film of 2006) Greengrass wants to stick to the facts, and not burden the film with side-stories.  That's probably best because he's better at the documentary details than he is with characters and personal drama.  Still, this is probably the most effective thriller you'll see all year.",

I'm not gonna get into debate here but the fact of the matter is, the kind of life and death situation is inevitable and it sucks to know that either side will lose a life even if the other is in the wrong. This movie shows an example of that situation is and it should be a lesson learn to us all and when I mean is that it's up to us how to handle such dangerous situation like this, not just in open waters and getting raided by the pirates but any similar dangerous situation.

The story of Captain Phillips getting captured as part of a ransom was a real surprise to find out.  In an intense recreation of those fateful days Paul greengrass delivers with Captain Phillips. Hanks does the same playing Phillips himself but the real star of the show ends up being Barkhad Abdi who debuts in killer fashion..literally as the leader of pirates Muse. This 2013 drama is a must see\n\tCaptain Phillips begins by showing Phillips on his way to his ship. Everything seems to go smooth until Muse and his band of pirates begin to slowly make their presence on the radar of the ship. They continue getting closer and closer and they discovered they are armed and ready to take over the cargo ship. The pirates are successful and the danger becomes very real. Phillips has the seemingly dangerous task of trying to negotiate and keep the pirates from killing the crew members aboard. \n\"Phillips\" has you on the edge of your seat! Just like the \"Bourne\" films truly is tense and suspenseful vintage greengrass if you will. Great cinematography loved the helicopter shots in the sea. Great editing always loved the editing work done in greengrass films. Good tense music to up the cinematic flavor. Barkhad abdi is reeeally superb here he plays a mysterious but dangerous criminal. you never have any idea what he's really thinking. Tom hanks was really good too but he got outshined by abdi. Not surprised he didn't get no Oscar nomination. The ending was pretty saddening in the sense that Phillips was really traumatized by that experience. Solid acting at that point there by hanks.\nI am very happy this picture got the recognition it got because it truly is a thriller that lives up to expectations and is superb on all accounts",

Tom Hanks gave an impressive performance and deserves full appreciation. Somali actor Barkhad Abdi too gave a noticeable performance which did add on to the fervent atmosphere.\n\nThis film was able to capture the intense plight and the comportment of the characters extremely impressively. Recreating a life like situation is always a big challenge for every director, more so because of the high conjecture. But each and every element of this film made it praiseworthy and credible. The background score, lighting, set, and the visual effects gelled extremely well together to make this film a success and even the tactical means to overcome the Somalians were projected exceptionally. This film provided a state-of-the-art element mainly because of the way it was adduced. The only thing that I found faulty was the cinematography; as much as I loved the intensity that the camera could capture, I do believe that the scenes could surely have been filmed a lot more clearly.\n\nEverything- from a good script to a good experience is provided by Captain Phillips and is a must watch for all those who appreciate smart cinema.",

            "content": "Have Camera, Will Shake\n\nDear Mr. Greengrass, your signature style using a nervous camera and jarring edits from start to finish has become all too tired and cliché. Although you seem to have cornered the market on shooting in choppy environments (hijacked planes and ships), your MO is wonky and outdated. It once provided us with the illusion of edgy unpredictability but no longer substitutes for good story-telling and suspenseful drama. It was fun for a while but substance outlives style. Next time out, unpack the tripod, see if you can't restrain those spasms.\n\nThe docudrama appearance of the film is at odds with it's Hollywood makeover and spoiled by casting a movie star in the title role. We can actually believe those were real Somali pirates stalking the ship, barefoot in a motorboat with a machine gun, so what's Tom Hanks doing out there? \n\nWhich captain is more likely to be nominated for an Oscar and which one is more deserving, Tom Hanks, the extremely likable hard-luck chap, or Barkhad Abdi, the very convincing \"skinny\" Somalian in his first acting role? \"Relax, everything's going to be okay, Mr. Phillips.\" \n\nThe story was initially framed from two opposing points of view. But for all the time we spend with the Captain and the pirates, we know very little about them. He's married. They are desperate. End of profile. This is why the endings of such undeveloped stories are abrupt and unsatisfying. The scrappy character development is ultimately why the movie needs illustrious old Tom Hanks and the indelible memory of his previous fictional characters. And, without question, a shaky camera.\n\nMuch of the dialogue was reduced to short outbursts of threats and fits of rage. The movie could have been released on Twitter. It rang rather empty when Hanks roared out they were not fishermen, since neither he or the audience knew much about them. Given his strategic thinking, you'd figure Phillips would have tried to sympathize with the attackers, get to know them, if only to weaken their resolve and possibly get them to turn against each other. Besides, isn't this what displaced main characters are meant to do? Be our eyes and ears in a narrative of conflict and discovery?\n\nThe Somalian Pirates fail to impress us as anything but deadly pests. Their crude onrush leaves me wondering why the most self-important nation on earth, so insanely obsessed and possessive about firearms, doesn't at least provide the old Cap with a pocket pistol for self-defence? Seriously, the only weapons provided for these gigantic container ships, so vital to a global economy, are water hoses?\n\nSome of the more interesting facts and details seemed to either be swept aside or glossed over. The pirates, for all their maniacal posturing, did not kill anyone. Attacking them was like swatting a mosquito with a wrecking ball. The absurdity is evident but never appeared foolish as the filmmakers brazenly flaunted conventional American propaganda. Disproportionately heroic American might and justice was never questioned.(The cost of hiring a warship perhaps?) \n\nThe desperation of the pirates mission was touched upon: return with the ship and/or the captain or face certain death. But the resolve of the American naval SEAL to rescue a single individual using its highly skilled and lopsided military was never in doubt. Thus, staking its claim on the foolhardy impression that every individual American life is sacred (if your white, well-to-do and married) but never once hinted that it was likely for the optics alone. This is typically implied by showing TV news coverage of the hostage crisis back home, often from the protagonist's family room. \n\nWe were introduced to his wife in the first scene but never see her again. Actually, I don't mind this omission. The movie succeeds rather well keeping us in the moment with a tense, rigid, alert objective in lieu of a broader and richer perspective. I got the feeling something important was happening--but little else.",

These guys are all first time actors, and not only do they master the pirate speech , but their mannerisms as well. Just the look in theirs eyes is chilling. It's really Heath Ledger Joker good.

Phillips initially tries to fight off the small band of rogues, but once he is defeated, he tries to learn a bit more about them, and through him, the audience is subjected to a surprisingly sympathetic - although certainly not rosy - image of the pirates and their own motives.\n\nThe film stars Tom Hanks and Catherine Keener, and also leaves plenty of roles open for unknown Somali actors to fill. One such role, that of the pirate leader Abduwali Muse, went to Barkhad Abdi, who portrayed so many layers to a character that could easily have been a caricature. That performance earned Abdi a well-deserved Academy Award nomination, but unfortunately he couldn't beat Jared Leto to the award.\n\nIt's a tense film (probably made more tense from my perspective as I was actually sailing on a boat when I watched this), and incredibly well-made, despite a little bit of shaky cam coming in. The writing was also superb. Just an intense film all around.\n\n9/10.",

The story was intense and believably told although u dont get a whole lot of background info. So its mostly just the capture that you watch. I think the US military did a great job removing Phillips safely. altho the first responders definitely screwed up by not listening to him from the beginning when he said we have pirates and the emergency line being busy. I remember when this happened in 2009 as a news story that we kinda joked about pirates being a thing again, but it is really terrifying and just like any terrorist hostage situation. What was most interesting perhaps is how the crew esp Captain tried to stop the pirates and whether that was smart or more dangerous. I think the whole hostage situation couldve been avoided if the ukmto had taken the captain serious or the emergency line had actually worked the first time they were under attack.",

The story of a man who was captured by pirates, and then left his own ship with them garnered international attention, and certainly interested Paul Greengrass enough to create this film.\n\nRight off the bat, we are introduced to our two main characters. I expected some lead-up for Phillips, but was surprised to see the origins of our band of pirates as well. It was a very conscious choice by the director, and while I don't take that much issue with it, be aware that it takes you to a very different place narratively.\n\nThere is plenty of suspense, and once we get on the boat, it flows very nicely. The characters are well-defined, and Tom Hanks brings a great energy to Captain Phillips. This is not 'merely' a biopic. This is an event film.",

Months have gone by, almost everyone has seen the film and most have praised it; therefore seeing and reading them, allowed my expectations to build, thinking that this film might actually be Greengrass' opus. Now that I have seen it, does the film live up to the hype? Yes, but only just.\n\nThe premise of Captain Phillips is certainly not original, but originality has never been something I look for in a Greengrass film. In his films, I search for heightened emotions gained from masterfully crafted sequences; building tension and maintaining it throughout. Very filmmakers could maintain tension and suspense in their films, let alone create it. The bulk of the film is driven by dialogue and Greengrass was able to create so much out of it; demanding intensity from his cast's performances and supporting it with his trademark collaboration with Barry Ackroyd, that delivers effective shaky-cam effects in its photography; using that to create the sense of claustrophobia and its adverse effects of frustration, fear and trauma on both sides of the event. This is what makes Captain Phillips more than just the average hostage film; it actually takes the time to explore both sides of the situation. These Somali pirates are not just seen as villains, they are also viewed as humans who show reasoning behind their decisions; which in this case are ego, pride, and survival. The film primarily contrasts two characters, Phillip and Muse; both are captains of their own side, and the film wonderfully shows us the necessity of their leadership in ensuring their objectives and responsibilities are being met. Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi brought so much to their characters, making them feel believable in their roles, showing little in their exteriors but one can feel their internal emotions. Then we are treated to a final moment with Hanks, that brings a wide range of emotions to the surface and show the impact that the situation has had on him. I was also left kind of sympathetic rather than achieving a feeling of triumph towards the antagonists, during the final moments of the film; and I have Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks' final scene to thank for that.\n\nCaptain Phillips, so far under my eyes, may not be Paul Greengrass' best film, but it certainly is his intimate; with its sense of claustrophobia and exploration into the minds and emotions of its leading characters.

Tom Hanks' Vermont accent sounds more generic New England than Green Mountain State, but most people aren't going to be able to tell unless they've spent a lot of time there. He's good, but not brilliant in the role. I can't think of anyone else who could have bested him. I credit the director for not making this a bash the USA and globalization spectacle. There's been enough of that lately. I'm sure nobody in Hollywood wants to look like they are opposed to Saint Obama, who authorized the use of deadly force in this case. I haven't heard of very many ship hijackings lately. I think the shipping companies got the message and have hired some rough men with assault rifles and telescopic sights to keep the Somalis at bay. Besides, all they really need to do is emigrate to the USA and they won't need to be criminals. They'll get it handed to them.",

This is not the typical action like ?oh, the main character is in danger all of the time, but hey, he?s the main character so he won?t die now?. Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) could get killed any moment and there aren?t any vanilla fighting-scenes - they?re unarmed civilians kept under control by pirates. So even if you aren?t into action packed movies you?ll enjoy this one none the less. Only a few films hold the tension on such a high level over the whole timespan, looking at this steady grip it?s comparable to ?Gravity? (2013).\n\nSadly the first half of the movie isn?t as excellent as the second half, it?s still unquestionable good, but not so overwhelming. If the start would be as well as the end this could be 8/10 easily. So there are some wide environment shots and close-ups in the beginning (the port and pirate camp etc.) with the typical army-inspired text describing location and time - come on hollywood, why has every action film the exact same pictures you can?t distinguish from others (this film has only few of them, but still it could?ve been without them). \n\nThen there?s Tom Hanks, starts to shine in the second half, why can?t you give us that performance from the beginning? Sure he?s good, but grows into a astonishing act only second half of the movie. I mean Captain Phillips probably got some emergency-training and the adrenalin does its job, but god, if there are some crazy pirates firing around like they don?t care i?d sh*t my pants for sure.\n\nSomething i absolutely dislike about the film is the camera movement: Unsteady and restless, used to intensify the action. It?s ok for the second half and you won?t notice it after a certain time, but it?s really disturbing in the beginning and doesn?t fit the first half of the movie. You can overlook it, they have to use the same camera style cause of consistency (and there?s no turning point where you can change your way of filming to express the change), but it?s still a mistake.\n\nDespite some additional unmentioned minor flaws (like this scene: Captain Phillips shouts a short sentence, repeats it two times, but the Somali don?t realize what he says and don?t get suspicious, even while they were talking english kinda well the whole movie), Director Paul Greengrass (known for Bourne-films) creates a very good action packed thriller, giving the main character more emotional depth than he usually does. I recommend this movie to everyone.\n\n================================\n\nmy rating scale \n\n10 over the top / 9 perfect / 8 must see / 7 extremely good / 6 very\ngood / 5 good / 4 OK / 3 so-so / 2 bad / 1 don't watch it\n\n================================\n\nAdditional Info: \n\nThe film was shot on real ships in the water instead of a studio with green walls and Tom Hanks even got seasick during the shooting - thumbs up!\n\nI compared it to ?Gravity? (2013), cause the tension curve is similar, but ?Captain Phillips? doesn?t have any artistic or stylistic components ?Gravity? is known for.",

The lead Somali actor (Barkhad Abdi) is convincingly ambiguous.  Paul Greenglass films this very methodically - the action seems to unfold in real time.

Tom Hanks plays Captain Phillips as he prepares the best a person can prepare for the inevitability of pirates attempting to take his ship ransom.\n\nQuickly the movie sets the foundation for Captain Phillips background, a captain who is doing a dangerous job, despite his wife's wishes, because there would be a line of men willing. Simultaneously the foundation is set for the pirates, boat loads of Somali men volunteering to hijack a ship, because this is a somber reality of life with no true alternative for livelihood. The crew, Navy, and audience wait as Richard Phillips is put in the perilous position of negotiator and hostage. The pirates are never as brutal as they have to be and the American crew members are never as heroic as they need to be.\n\nHanks does a more than adequate job as a sympathizer to the pirates, trying to get everyone out of the situation intact and alive. This selfless and heroic character is probably not accurate to the real Captain Phillips persona, but necessary as a counter view to the pirates' story. I found myself identifying with the pirates, hoping they would have some sense, despite knowing the end to the story. This is thanks in part to the main Somali pirate, Muse, played by Barkhad Abdi. I am thankful he has received as many accolades as he has, though not a trained actor, he turns out a multi-layered character under tragic circumstances.\n\nThis movie easily could have been a one-sided telling of the brutalities of the pirates, instead you get a multidimensional story that is more about the current effects of globalization than the thrilling encounter.",

In an age of rampant terrorism, the story was headline news and was so highly publicized that the President of the United States got involved, along with the Navy Seals. To many, it was shocking news that this sort of thing happens. Pirates? Really? These aren't Jack Sparrow, Captain Hook type pirates, these are desperate, vicious, poor pirates in small boats with nothing to lose. These are pirates who are for the most part, under orders of bigger controlling groups who pray upon the desperate lifestyles of the Somali people.\n\nMuch has been said about the accuracy of the book written by Captain Phillips, \"A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy Seals, and Dangerous Days at Sea\" and now the movie, \"Captain Phillips\". In fact, many of the crew of the Maersk Alabama are now suing Captain Phillips for wantonly and arrogantly putting them in danger. They are telling stories that completely contradict much of what you see in the film leading up to the pirates boarding their ship. This to me is extremely disappointing if their stories are true. I believe it is irresponsible for movie-makers to misrepresent history. Many people take the easy way out when learning about history and movies leave a huge impression on their minds.\n\nThat being said, I assume that most of the movie is completely accurate as most of what happened after the pirates boarded is documented by news outlets and the Navy Seals. Director Paul Greengrass handled the true story with a realistic eye. He's made a niche for himself with 7-true story films, the most recognizable of those being \"United 93\". His staging of events is engrossing, vivid and at times tough to watch.\n\n\"Captain Phillips\" is listed as an action/thriller, but those viewing the film would be quick to mention that this movie shouldn't be lumped in with the typical action movie. I would consider \"Captain Phillips\" more a drama than an action/thriller. You are side by side Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) through this realistic and horrible incident with pirates who cannot be accused of being intelligent, but are certainly without a morale code or an alternative to their actions.\n\nThe movie is tough to watch at times and possibly a little long, but for the most part it is an amazing look inside one of the biggest news stories of 2009. The pirates, although portrayed realistically are infuriating to watch and annoying to watch. From beginning to end they are amazingly fool-minded, disorganized and constantly angrily yelling. I agree that these portrayal's are probably extremely accurate, but as a movie, they are like listening to 10 people yelling different stories at each other for over an hour.\n\n\"Captain Phillips\" is not for everybody and there's a reason why the creators called this an action/thriller. If they told you what it really was, you probably wouldn't go. \"Captain Phillips\" is not fun to watch and far from thrilling. It is not filled with harrowing and exciting bravery at every corner. It is not filled with twists and turns. It is a dirty, difficult and drudging film that tells the story of real people in a horrible and real situation. If you like that sort of thing, go see it. Not a repeat viewer type thing though. The terrorists are annoying and the subject matter is depressing.",

As in absolutely nothing was happening. I can't explain it but once Captain Phillips was put in the boat I just started to get very...bored. The second half of the story was the hijackers and Captain Phillips standing around in the boat. The climax almost makes up for this though, with Tom Hanks's performance hitting it home (and btw I agree HE WAS ROBBED OF THE OSCAR NOD!). \nSo the acting was great and the camera work was well put together.

            "content": "Captain Philips - the movie: Wow. Still reeling with admiration for this most riveting, meaningful, terrifying, moving portrayal of a real life story.  Finally rented it on DVD last night. It's one of those movies I feel compelled to talk about because I can't stop thinking about it - now 24 hours later. Thrilling, intense, nail-biting, it is also morally complex and tragic.\nOne of the best things about renting it on DVD was being able to watch the 1-hour \"making-of\" documentary immediately afterwards, which was almost as riveting and fascinating as the movie itself.\nThe Somali pirates who attack Captain Philips' ship are so real. They're played by real Somali born young men (now living in the US) who have never acted in a movie before. They've been given several months of training by the director, and they do a phenomenal job. They give a menacing authenticity to the movie. The director deliberately kept them apart from the other team of actors - (i.e. Tom Hanks and his crew on board the ship) - not allowing them to meet socially off set before the movie shooting, so that when these Somalis first climb aboard and storm in to the bridge screaming and wielding their AK-47s, they create a genuine atmosphere of terror, anxiety and tension.\nTwo time Oscar winner, Tom Hanks, doesn't need help acting of course, but the fear in this scene (and the rest of the movie) is so palpable, it's easy to see why many critics are saying this could be his best performance yet. And he really was fantastic. I've always been a big Hanks fan, and this just continues to reinforce my opinion of him as one of the greats. He's just so darn professional, talented, extraordinary, and deeply moving. The other supporting actors are all very realistic too, and it was satisfying to see (in the documentary) how much research they all did into portraying the typical lives of these sailors on board these cargo ships. The making-of documentary was a great way to see just how much work they ALL put into this movie, line by line, moment by moment, scene by scene. It very much reminded me of the process of recording my professional choir CDs. Performing phrases, words and lines over and over again, until you reach as near perfection as possible, with the director steering you at every turn.\nWhat I also found deeply satisfying was the way the movie gave us the background stories, not only of Philips' life and that of his American crew, but also of the Somali pirates. The movie makes them human individuals that we can't help sympathizing with because of the tragic, violent and meaningless lives they are forced to lead. It does not mask or gloss over the heinousness of their criminal trade, but shows their desperation, their poverty, their crazed frenzy to assert what little power they have, and try to earn a sense of worth, even if it is tragically misguided, and even if it is only to \"please\" their war-mongering war-lords. After watching the documentary, and finding out more about the Somali pirates - I felt this even more strongly. It was especially heartening to watch the interview afterwards, with the actor, Barkhad Abdi, who plays the lead pirate (Muse), and hear him talk with deep emotion about lucky he himself was to be able to get out of Somalia at the age of 14 with his family, and settle in the US and make a better life, and \"be a better person.\"\nBesides the moral and political aspects of the movie, it was also just tons of fun to watch the thrilling chase of the pirates by the full fleet of the US Navy in all its military glory. At one point, I really felt like I was watching a particularly good Star Trek episode, where aliens were invading and the U.S.S. Enterprise had called in reinforcements to battle them. All the naval terms and phrases: - \"5 degrees starboard\", and the official naval talk over the radios during the fast paced chase and rescue scene - was very much star-ship thriller material - except this wasn't a star ship, this was a real ship! This was a thriller at its best, with all the elements of nail-biting suspense, swift, heart-thudding action, twist and turns and tension right up until the very emotional end.\nIt was particularly thrilling to watch the real Captain Richard Philips being interviewed in the documentary afterwards, to get some more bits of the story from his own lips, and to see this real-life hero, clearly affected by, but not beaten down by, his ordeal. An admirable man, and an admirable tale of bravery and endurance, brilliantly portrayed and honored by this movie.\nAt the end of it, you are reeling with the multi-layered morals and messages you've just been given. It's a tale of a heroic Captain in peril on the high seas, and the awe-inspiring military rescue he is given by the mighty US Navy. But it's also a tragic tale of the miserable, crazed, desperate, power thirsty men of Somalia, beaten down by a country that has no economy, no structure, no education, no hope to offer, other than idle threats and empty promises. At the end, you wonder, you hope, that one day, maybe, this tragic situation might eventually be changed, helped, resolved somehow, with time and development... This movie (and many others like it) may help generate a global awareness, if nothing else, and maybe a passion for change for the better.",

            "content": "Hi, if you'd like to see this review with pictures and stuff, you can read it on my blog, right here: http://mps-marvelous-movie-reviews.blogspot.ie/2014/07/captain-phillips-review.html\n\nOr you can read it here, as always.\n\nCaptain Phillips is Paul Greengrass (Bloody Sunday, United 93)' tightly-wound retelling of the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama in 2009 - the first such incident involving an American vessel in well over 100 years. It's a film that sells itself on the appeal of director Greengrass' punchy, fast-paced storytelling, but benefits from a powerhouse performance, courtesy of Tom Hanks, and Greengrass' own innate ability to blend narrative weight with the higher-stakes action. For a populist film (my filmically uninclined friend called it the best movie he's seen in a while), it explores a number of interesting themes, including class divide, the justification of piracy, and the lengths a man will go to in the defense of his life and those of others.\n\n\nHanks carries the film as Richard Phillips, captain of an unarmed container ship making the journey from Oman to Mombasa, travelling around the Horn of Africa. Of course, the ship is targeted by Somali pirates (who saw that one coming?), and Phillips enters into a very dangerous battle of wits with the pirates, led by young Somalian, Muse (Barkhad Abdi, in a breakout role). For the most part, Greengrass does a fantastic job at portraying the high stakes of Phillips' confrontation with Muse, and the dire situation of the Maersk Alabama and her crew. His polarising use of quick shots, zoom-ins and shaky cam is put to good use, infusing an action movie quality to a mostly sober drama.\n\nThe doubtless highlight of the film comes in it's leads, who couldn't be more different. America's Best Friend Tom Hanks is Phillips, in what might be his best performance in over a decade. While Billy Ray's screenplay is said to divert from the real Phillips' persona, Hanks is as Hanks does, bringing a jaw-dropping realism to his performance. Every life-or-death decision he makes in the film is built on all the rationality a man can have in a hostage situation, and one can see the wheels turning in Hanks' head with every utterance. Simply put, it's a performance of tremendous magnitude, sampling a wide palette of emotions and sensations. It's a performance that would sell any film, and Hanks' Oscar snub still baffles.\n\nOn the other end of the gun, we have Barkhad Abdi. The film makes use of real Somalians to heighten the realism of an unnervingly realistic film, and Abdi is clearly the standout. Among his bigger stronger cohorts, Muse is calm and collected, speaking each word with an icy cool. Every utterance is a threat in disguise, and Abdi captures the layered nature of his character exceptionally well. For a first-time performance, it's a knockout, and Abdi deserved his Oscar nomination (in the year's toughest category).\n\nThe film, on a technical level, is moreso about what one likes as a viewer. If you can handle Paul Greengrass' oft-nauseating pace, then the film will work for you. His pseudo-documentary style, replete with dizzying cuts, close-ups, and zoom-ins, makes for a headache-inducing time, but his inclusion of tracking shots, wide shots, and establishing shots hold the film back from losing it's dramatic focus. Greengrass is occasionally guilty of stretching the film too much and letting it sag, leading to a few interminably dull, meandering scenes.\n\nAnd that's where the film's greatest flaw appears. While Greengrass makes good use of Barry Ackyroyd's cinematography, and doesn't overdo the frenetic shots he's famous for, there comes a small number of times in the film where it seems like Greengrass simply loses sight of narrative finesse. It's understandable that a film based on true events can only tailor those events to suit it's subtext to a certain degree, but I was surprised by just how dull much of the film ended up being. The finale is excellent, and just about everything from it's first hour is engaging cinema, but between those points, the film spends far too long in an aimless drift, delivering none of the keen insight or great character development of earlier in the film.\n\nDespite this, the film is bolstered by two powerhouse performances, each from a very different actor, both with very different material. Director Paul Greengrass makes great use of the confined settings of the film, and charges the film with social and economic themes reflective of it's time period. Billy Ray's screenplay is inconsistent, but the film's style and breakneck pace make up for it's uninspiring material. Ultimately, the film is a success on the back's of it's leads, and Greengrass' mostly sure-handed directorial talents. If it were a shade more consistent, I feel it would have better-merited it's six Oscar nominations.\n\nCaptain Phillips gets a 7/10.",

            "content": "Somalia has been country operating in the absence of government. Those in America speaking with a bit of levity might say that sounds pretty good right about now. In reality, this has brought forth a nation ravaged with war, poverty, disease, and hunger. In desperate times, many in the Horn region of Africa have turned to extremes, shunning livelihoods as fisherman for the acts of pirating ships for ransom. Captain Phillips spends very little time within the country itself,but through its characters, Director Paul Greengrass illustrates the clashes resulting from two paradigms, two crews, and two captains clashing near the coast of Africa in 2009.\n\nCaptain Richard Phillips steers his cargo vessel from the Middle Eastern country of Oman with an itinerary to Mombasa. In parallel, we are introduced to Abduwali Muse, a Somali fisherman with some clout as a tribal pirate, convincingly brought to life by acting rookie Barkhad Abdi. Muse's back story is minimal, simply introducing him with the goal of explaining his motivations and ambitions, but stopping just short of evoking sympathy. These analogous prologues introduce two unequal worlds, and also two captains who only operate within their own rules; both are natural, yet flawed, leaders.\n\nMuse leads a \"crew\" to take over the MV Maersk Alabama, Phillips's ship, hoping to evoke a ransom that shipping companies seem to accept in this part of the world (Muse constantly explains that the \"insurance man\" will come and \"make everything alright\"). Abdi establishes his presence on screen far before his American counterpart. He's simpleminded, as though piracy is all he's ever known, since fishing around the coast of Somalia is not a sustainable life anymore. This simplicity, however,is overwhelmed with a determination to succeed and perhaps make his way to America, a country he believes he is knowledgeable about.\n\nCinematography is often overlooked, partially because bad camera work is unfortunately more noticeable than a gifted craftsman behind the lens. I mention this because of the value-added Barry Ackroyd provides to Captain Phillips. To keep a story entrancing and tension sustained within the confines of a small space is not only a talent, but a necessity in this case. Additionally, the use of the shaky documentary-style shoot Greengrass is known for adds a dose of reality without the bout of nausea we usually have to endure. To peer through the windows of a small vessel and spot looming Navy vessels in the short distance evoked memories of similar shots in other waterborne films such as Master and Commanderand Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nLike movies should, Captain Phillips forces the audience to ask questions. The most obvious, and more important to those depicted in the film, is why the protocol for piracy isn't more efficient in that part of the world?\n\nMoreover, Hanks begs us to answer the question: what would you do in this situation? This second question is more important in the eyes of the director, and should be for any making films in this genre. Action or thriller movies are effective when they are all-enveloping, capturing all of our senses in the moment on screen, and thrusting us into the foreground.Captain Phillips isn't as successful as some recent films in this respect: we don't feel the raw weight as in Prisoners or the fear of emptiness throughout Gravity.\n\nBut, having a veteran like Hanks on board rights the ship throughout. He's not a superhero, but he is far from latent. Always aware of the situation (the tension-filled crew, the necessity of preparedness), the veteran captain tries to control what little he can (acting as a first-aid agent on the lifeboat). The influence he has on the rest of the crew (film and ship) is just what makes this film come together. You'll be very aware of his performance and ability in this film just prior to the curtain dropping; his raw emotion is awe-inspiring.\n\nDespite some questionable scene transitions and indeterminate timeline, Captain Phillips is intriguing and fresh. The mood of this film is far more upbeat than recent releases, but is topped with a note of intensity and seriousness we're used to in these types of films.\n\nRead more reviews at RJGFilmAnalysis.com",

He drives us into the real adaptation of Captain Phillips hijack scenario played by terrific Hanks and his fellow somalian pirates lead by newbie Abdi. The film as a whole was my pick of the best. I liked every aspect of this film. The story was intense, narrative was gripping, the music was awesome and the cinematography was pin point. The tense moments Greengrass creates after an hour into the movie keeps us waiting for the reaction to come by. The script never relents to go down, rather every move made by Greengrass be it the puzzling action, hard hitting dialogues works really well. I might give a bit low for the film rather than a full score, because it had a run time of nearly one hundred and thirty minutes. That is way too long for a ¬¬drama film. But hey I might still look it was good enough. If I am the editor of the film, I might cut down 10 minutes or so, but that won't make any difference. \nHanks was awesome in his role. He really made me believe that he is the captain of Maersk Alabama. The pirates in this film! OMG they were freaking superb. The leader Abdi was striking intense expressions and his chemistry with Hanks is sure to watch out for. The real mood setter for the film comes from the score of Henry Jackman. The background score was pulsating and certain tracks kept me waiting for the intensity of a particular scene. The surprise twists were good enough, the brooding yet glorious climax part was clap worthy and the last frame performance from Hanks surely deserves Oscar selection, if not a winner. Captain Phillips on the whole was interesting, action thriller. I loved it, enjoyed every bit of it and I would surely recommend this film. This is a movie with daunting surprise and Greengrass, deserves to be the captain. Mission accomplished. Hanks you get my marks. Abdi, you steal the show. Way to go. Board the cruise!

The action is intense, and the plot moves along quickly.  It is in the last moments of the film, especially the phenomenally vulnerable turn by Tom Hanks, that makes this film worth watching.\nThe film's attempts to humanize the Somali pirates fails - not miserably but fails nonetheless.  We get shots of Somali poverty, the Somali social order, and the trailer-publicize line, \"Maybe in America,\" but these moments don't amount to much because by the end of the film, there's no real understanding or human sympathy possible on the part of either the characters or the audience.  The Somalis are unquestioned bad guys; director Paul Greengrass might as well have given them red light sabers.\nOverall, Hanks's performance is strong and the film is a good addition to the thriller genre.",

Director Paul Greengrass handles the film expertly and efficiently, giving the right amount of suspense and tension to the necessary scenes.

            "content": "A movie adaptation of the Maersk Alabama hijacking, Captain Phillips is a mixed bag on paper. The very talented Paul Greengrass, coupled with Tom Hanks who fits the role of Richard Phillips perfectly create a stark contrast to the unproven acting talent in the Somali cast, who are featured almost as heavily as Hanks. I didn't have any expectations going to see it, so was happy to discover how well it actually turned out.\n\nThe film begins with some simple exposition. It's dull stuff, but provides context and an opportunity to aquatint ourselves with characters not only in the Alabama, but on the pirate side of the story. The pirates themselves are newcomers, but all do extremely well. Barkhad Abdi deserves particular note for his role which has a close symmetry to Richard Phillips and helps to paint the pirates as vividly human, and not just another force of evil.\n\nHanks performance is terrific as normal, but it's the last five minutes of it that will blow you away, and left me on the verge of tears. It was completely unexpected and gives every bit of respect that the real life story deserves.\n\nThe whole film builds stress on top of tension and it creates scenes which can be genuinely difficult to watch, especially as the times goes on. Greengrass uses his signature shaky-cam frequently, and to varying success. When done right it can really lead to moments which feel real and terrifying, while it's continued use in the quieter moments of the film can pull you out of an otherwise very engrossing film.\n\nAlso guaranteed to divide opinion is the soundtrack. It works very well, but it's also often just a (admittedly good) remix of Inception. The chords are obviously the same, as is the instrumentation. Again, in the movie it sounds great and I'm aware that the composer is close to Hans Zimmer, but it's still a blatant cut and paste job which in my opinion works against the film.\n\nIn truth though, at this point I'm nitpicking. Well directed and acted, Captain Phillips suffers occasionally from some cinematography issues and a slightly lacking second act. But is also a tense and thoroughly enjoyable movie, and one of the best \"true story\" films that I've watched in a very long time.\n\n- expandac.com",

It wasn't as exciting as the true story, which is obviously the case with any adaptation, but it gets almost \"Scooby Doo\" cartoonish at times.  The second half of the film is better than the first half, but it still feels like \"A Bourne movie in the control room\" placed at sea.  I mean if they just took out the one guy, the rest of the others just wanted to negotiate.  It's sort of disappointing that it becomes Cast Away in a lifeboat.",

It's a suspenseful and moody film which is focused and to the point with a good cast. When Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks) is assigned to command the MV Maersk Alabama from Oman to Mombasa, Kenya. It seems just like another job, but it will mean navigating dangerous waters where Somali Pirates are rife, and it happens here. 4 pirates, led by Abduwali Muse (Barkhad Abdi), are able to catch up with the ship and board it, and they take Phillips hostage. They're unimpressed that the ship only holds $30,000. But after the crew fight back against the pirates in the engine room, they makes off in a lifeboat with Phillips as hostage, but the U.S. Navy Seals find them, and are determined to save Phillips. It's a very taut and tight thriller with some good moments of suspense. Hanks is brilliant as the brave captain just trying to stay alive, but the real life Somalians as the pirates, all non-actors, are brilliant, and it was a real coup getting them involved in the film, but their plight shown in the film is tragic and cruel as well.",

Rien de ce qui n'était prévu, d'un côté comme de l'autre.\nPaul Greengrass s'attaque cette fois à l'adaptation d'une histoire vraie.

Pour eux, ce sont les marins les méchants. Cet angle est évoqué brièvement par Greengrass mais reste dans nos têtes et nous permet de comprendre, sans l'approuver, l'action des somaliens. La tension monte au fur et à mesure de l'histoire. Le face à face Phillips/Muse (le leader) est bien fait, presque respectueux l'un de l'autre. On admire l'attitude du Capitaine, gardant son sang-froid du mieux qu'il peut et protégeant ses hommes jusqu'au bout.

A situação não demora a se concretizar, quando dois barcos chegam perto do cargueiro, com oito somalianos armados, exigindo todo o dinheiro a bordo.

There are 2 reasons for my four out five rating; the first is the atrocious cinematography, \"Captain Phillips\" has all the hallmarks of a deprived single-mother-home-t.v.-only mentality that was raised on the pan-and-scan butchered film. (I cannot wait till film making evolves to the generation raised with the new standard of 16:9 T.V., which allows for the 2.35:1 movie ratio without the historical distortion! No more pan-and-scan and no more over-close-ups!)\nThe second is the encapsulated ending where we read about the real-life version of \"Captain Phillips\", at least the updated whereabouts, which did not conclude any reference to the open scenes, where a frustrated captain is leaving his wife of necessity, not desire. Yet where is is wife in the conclusion, let alone his mentioned children?\nReal life is one thing, but movies are entertainment, \"Captain Phillips\" is not a documentary. It is not meant to represent the facts of the situation, but present a fictional account, of an actual event, whether to inspire a desire to know the the truth, or bring unaware viewers into an awareness of otherwise unknown event.\nGo \"millennials\" and beyond! Here's hoping for better cinematography!!!",

You know the interesting thing about this is that this is based on the biopic of Captain Richard Phillips himself and it is based off this book called \"A Captain's Duty.\" Now in the book they portray the captain as heroic, like he came together and stopped those pirates, but in reality the rest of the crew said that he really just fucked everything up. But no matter what you believe, we all go into Hollywood looking at a biopic and thinking to ourselves that we are not really watching a real story. Or perhaps maybe half of it is true, or a quarter of it, but we all know it is not the whole true story. But whether you know about the story or you don't believe in it, one thing I can say is that this movie is what it is. I was expecting a very standard biopic and that is exactly what I got. So just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a fateful trip. That started from a point of interest to just another meager review aboard this movie. \n\nThe first half of this movie had me on the edge of my seat; but after those Somalian's boarded onto that big boat, and then later jumped into the smaller boat, I pretty much lost interest after that. Tom Hanks is playing, well....Tom Hanks but he still does a pretty god job at it. However I thought those Somalian's were really good in this movie, especially the leader of the group Muse who was played by Barkhad Abdi (\"Yes\" I did look him up on IMDB to find that actor). That guy could easily be on The Walking Dead with no extra makeup at all. The Somalian's are super intense, did a good job at building their characters (where we get to know each and every one of them), and as the movie goes on the more interesting things got in the lifeboat sequence as we see their relationship crumble between them & defining them as actual human beings. The drama in this movie is there along with some pretty decent dialogue to go with it. It is able to handle everything that you get to see in an action movie that works. Is has stealth, gunplay, narrow escapes, Wilson from Cast Away, etc. I say drama and not action is because it builds everything up to look like it has action, like taking out the bad guys one by one or explosions, but it never does and makes it a lot of sensible. I would not go far as to say that it was boring, however I started losing momentum in it. The momentum where it was good for the first half and the second half it just went a little too long and it is a long movie. Overall it is well done and hits all of the marks like it should, but for me I was ready for this thing to wrap up. It is easily a four stars all the way.",

The hero of this tale, merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips, reportedly did his very best to save his crew and wound up getting taken as a hostage by four Somalian pirates led by Abduwali Muse before being rescued by U.S. Navy SEALs after a lengthy standoff. It was a dire situation, and film director Paul Greengrass attempted to bring this real-world piracy to the big screen, culminating in the film Captain Phillips, starring Tom Hanks as Captain Richard Phillips and Barkhad Abdi as Abduwali Muse. I must say, however, that I really was not expecting all that much from this movie, mostly because it is very hard to translate real-life events into film while still maintaining a certain degree of excitement and suspense. Yet, Captain Phillips legitimately surprised me, as I find the film to be one of the best of 2013.\n\nRead the rest of this review at www.ramavalanche.wordpress.com",

            "content": "I didn't quite know what to expect from this movie. I was vaguely familiar with the actual true life account. I was pleasantly surprised! This is one of the best movies of the year.  \r\n\r\nIt tells the real life account of a freighter captain that has been taken hostage by Somali pirates. The movie starts with the daily mundane tasks of a freighter captain and the routine run that they are making to deliver their cargo. They must pass by the Somali waters where pirate activity and hostage taking has become a serious problem in that part of the world. \r\n\r\nSomalia is located on the horn of Africa and is the location of the U.S. mission to capture a local warlord that went horribly wrong. The downing of Super 6-1 is commonly known as the black hawk down incident. The country of Somalia basically has no government and poverty and violence are just a way of everyday life. Many, such as the pirates, turn to crime to survive. The taking of hostages can be a very lucrative endeavor for these pirates, since the ransom money can be pretty substantial. \r\n\r\nWhen ships come under attack by pirates the crew has almost no means to defend themselves, save for water cannons mounted on the perimeter of the vessel. These water cannons can sometimes deter the pirates, but in this case the pirates were determined not to be stopped. \r\n\r\nWhen the pirates attack it is an intense moment but there is the feeling of safety you get when you see the pirates stopped again and again by the water cannons. The threat level they pose to you seems to lesson somewhat as one of the pirate boats is stopped. The other pirate boat continues the pursuit and is ultimately successful. The moment when the pirates grab onto the ship and start climbing up onto the deck is a moment of impending doom for the crew because now there is nothing they can do to get rid of the pirates. You feel this helplessness as they start to climb and the captain first sees them coming over the side on the deck. It is only a matter of time before they take over the ship and get their hostages. \r\n\r\nThe movie is a not a special effects extravaganza that is very busy with the action sequences. The intense moments in this movie are grounded in reality. There is a subtlety to the movie that is refreshing in an era that is over saturated with special effects laden, over the top superhero movies. \r\n\r\nThe actor that plays the leader of the pirates does a phenomenal job. He can convey a real feeling fear to the audience. You get a feel for what it would be like to have an encounter such as Captain Phillips did. \r\n\r\nThe movie progresses at a good pace and it never drags or accelerates too quickly through the events. Even during the slower times in the movie, such as the time when all are in the life boat trying to escape with the hostage, you find yourself glued to the screen. \r\n\r\nIt was an unexpected surprise for the writers tell portray one of the pirates as just a kid that has \"fallen in with the wrong crowd\". He is unsure of his situation and seems to have empathy for Phillips that the others don't. He doesn't seem to wish any real harm to him and seems to just wish that this situation were over so he could go home. \r\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT: When the SEAL snipers take out all the pirates you do feel sorry for this kid wondering what could have been had he had a chance for a different life or was able to leave Somalia for another country like America. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the situation by a team of Navy SEALS is satisfying end to the movie. Tom Hanks performance is always superb in all the movies that I've ever seen with him. He conveys to the audience very effectively what the real Captain Phillips was dealing with emotionally. \r\n\r\nHow accurate this movie is to the real events is always suspect. Hollywood always has what seems as a disclaimer that doubles as a hook to get people to watch the movie: \"Based on a true story\". There are conflicting accounts from the media, crew members and Captain Phillips himself as to the events. His crew went as far to say that Phillips was a reckless Captain that always seemed to have some desire for adventure and intentionally steered the ships towards dangerous waters. Whether this is true or not is always debatable. It's basically a \"he said she said\" situation. \r\n\r\nAn intriguing movie based on real-life events that doesn't disappoint. Highly recommend seeing this movie.",

            "content": "Tom Hanks not getting an Oscar nomination caused quite a controversy at the Oscars this year. Well I can tell you know what I believe was the right choice, my review of Captain Phillips now.\n\nBased on the true story of Captain Richard's Phillips ship being taken over by Somalian Pirates. \n\nHoly crap....Just wow. Let me tell you that Captain Phillips without a doubt is one of the best movies of 2013, I mean one of the best. How Tom Hanks managed to get snubbed from this year is something I have no idea about.\n\nAll of the actors did really well but lets talk about our two stars. First off, Tom Hanks does his best acting in Saving Private Ryan, not quite as good but still he is mesmerizing in the lead role. I'm not a big fan of spoilers but I'm gonna tell you something right now so don't read it if you plan to watch the movie. ***The scene where Phillips is going into shock after being rescued was the shining moment in the entire movie. I couldn't believe it when Hanks was acting like he was going into shock, I FELT like he was actually going into shock! Tom Hanks was that believable in that one scene*** and that one scene along should have gotten him an Oscar nomination! Our other star of the movie is Barkhad Abdi, the leader of the Somalian pirate raid on the ship. So is Abdi's first ever move, first ever acting and he's great in the role. I mean, for a breakthrough role this is kind of shocking. While not like Hanks acting he does provide a lot of great scenes and constantly keeping to keep you at the edge of your seats.\n\nCaptain Phillips is also by far the most intense movie I have seen all year. Yes World War Z or The Hobbit were intense but nothing like this, remember this is based on a TRUE STORY. After the first twenty minutes pass getting to know the characters and the actual story comes in, there wasn't a moment where I wasn't indulged in the story! Tom Hanks trying his hardest to keep the pirates away was good but after they get on the boat and take him hostage, that is what killed me. You have no idea if any of the passengers are gonna come out alive or if the pirates will shoot and kill them. Then more spoilers sorry ***When Muse gets Phillips in the lifeboat and the navy is trying to get him out, holy crap.*** This entire movie is just intense and unbelievable. \n\nAnother thing I really liked in the movie was the character interaction. The scenes between Phillips and Muse were by far the best of the movie. You have to remember that these pirates have these very large guns that could easily kill any crew member they wish to kill, it was a battle between Muse and Phillips trying to keep everyone alive. At times it would be Muse yelling at Phillips and threatening to kill him or even just the quiet conversations with them was just fantastic. Their acting abilities did really help them out.\n\nPaul Greengrass's direction on the movie was spectacular. He made you feel seasick watching the movie. He had the cameras on the Somalian pirates boats and you could see the camera move up and down, watch splashing on it. I felt like I was actually on that boat when they were trying to take it. Then we have the lifeboat situation where everything is enclosed and you feel claustrophobic. He had made me feel a little claustrophobic watching the movie with the different closeups of the characters and the pirates battle to get pass the navy.\n\nWe have a lot more things to appreciate in this film like the screenplay. The dialogue between the characters not just the interaction was great. It wasn't cheesy, over the top, or anything. It was very strong and some of the best dialogue and one of the best screenplays of 2013. Then the music they played, loved that. \n\nCaptian Phillips is by far one of the best movies of 2013. It was intense, perfectly acted by both Tom Hanks and a breakthough Barkhad Abdi. I loved everyone second of it.\n\nI give Captain Phillips an A+",

Tom Hanks is at his absolute best, there's a scene in the movie where I genuinely felt like he was on the verge of breaking down in terror, and this scene was after the whole event ended and he was being seen to by doctors. Hanks is just incredible, anyone who says he's a bad actor just doesn't like him because this guy is excellent. Newcomer Barkhad Abdi is just as good, if not that tiny bit better as the lead pirate Muse, who fights for control. Abdi is like a powerhouse up against Hanks, both steal the screen whenever they are being focused on so it's exciting watching the two play polar opposite characters. The overwhelming critical acclaim is deserving, for the most part being the cast performances and Director Paul Greengrass' ability to deliver real grit and riveting suspense. Would I watch it again? Of course, it's unforgettable and a highlight of 2013 but the only part that slowed the movie down for me was when Captain Phillips was on his own aboard the emergency life raft, it felt as if the tension and gripping nature has fizzled out, but after that comes a finale boasting a true performance from Hanks.",

For some reason he just seems to melt into the parts he takes on and really does an outstanding job of portraying the character. I honestly would have thought he spoke with a southern drawl in real life if I didn't know any better. That is how impressive this performance is. The movie itself portrays the story rather well. Sometimes it is difficult to make a true story into a movie without drastically changing the events, but they seemed to do a pretty good job there as well. The intensity levels continually rise throughout the movie until the dramatic climax. The only downside that I can think of is that I wished they would have stressed a bit more just how impressive the tactics of the Navy crewman and SEALs were. I don't think they got enough credit for a job well done. That being said, the movie is impressive in almost all aspects.

            "content": "\"Based on a true story.\" I never know what to expect when I read those words on a movie poster, especially when it is a high profile story where I already know the end result in the real world. I knew the general idea of what happened in Captain Phillips' ordeal with the pirates, so I wondered if they would be able to still pull off the tension of an attack at sea. Sure enough I was riveted. While you may know 1 or 2 key things that happen in the story, there are lots of little moments that should keep you on the edge of your seat. One of the more interesting aspects of the film is that, despite the title, it is not all focused on that one guy. We see a lot of events where Captain Phillips is merely the MacGuffin which brings a number of other characters together. This is initially set up in the opening scenes when, right after showing Phillips leaving for his trip, we are shown the pirates gathering their crew for the day. There are similar scenes later when the navy is gearing up to become involved in the situation. So, while we have a clear protagonist this isn't solely his movie, and the film doesn't go out of its way to artificially inflate him into some super action hero. In fact it almost gives the movie a documentary feel, which is also felt in the over use of handheld shaky camera. I really hated the shaky look of the film in the early scenes, but later I felt like things became more stable and I didn't need any more dramamine.\n\nTom Hanks should have received a best actor nomination, it's as simple as that. His accent was spot on, and he held it perfectly for most of the film. He seems so level-headed throughout the film, but as events continue to escalate around him, you can sense an underlying emotional roller coaster. This all culminates to the final scenes which I won't spoil for others, but I can say left me in tears. On the flip side I don't think Barkhad Abdi deserved a nomination for supporting actor. His performance did not contain much nuance, in fact it was somewhat flat and one-note. I felt like they were trying to prod me into feeling a bit sympathetic for his character because he was caught between a rock and a hard place, but I never was convinced and Abdi's performance lacked the underlying heart to get me there. The rest of the pirate crew (the only other significant characters in the film) were all typical movie bad guys. You've got your one young kid who's in over his head, and just kind of wants to go home. You've got your almost silent guy who's just trying to do his job without asking too many questions. And finally you've got your big muscle-bound guy who has rage issues, and creates a bunch of artificial tension simply by questioning his cohort who's supposed to be the one in charge. If you've seen any other movie or TV show with a hostage situation you'll probably recognize these personalities.\n\nThat is my biggest problem with Captain Phillips as a film. While it has the unique aspect of being a true story, it feels so carbon copy out of Hollywood Hostage Stories 101. Through no fault of their own I just kept thinking \"I've seen this before.\" Now that's not a huge problem, because it is a quality story, but I just wanted more surprises. The opening had so much promise, because the battle with the pirate ship and the subsequent confrontation between the pirates and the crew were great. Yet eventually it became a hostage story, and I started losing interest. It doesn't help that the second half of this film really dragged. It was almost a constant cycle of yelling and bickering between the pirates, threatening to kill a hostage, and then agreeing that a dead hostage is worthless. Eventually things picked up, though, and the closing scenes were excellent and did a great job of recapturing that tension I felt in the beginning of the film. Perhaps if they had condensed things a bit and edited out some of the middle scenes it would have been even better, but I'm not sure if the final moments would have the same impact if the ordeal didn't feel so long. Either way, even with the lull that hit in the middle, I still found this to be a very good film. I won't be revisiting it any time soon, but I'm glad I was able to see one of the better movies from 2013.",

Maersk doesn't want to pay for security, so the Navy takes their place? I can see that being acceptable to some degree, but it does seem to me that Maersk needs to be a bit more accountable.

Maybe it's because he's been nominated so many times it was \"time to give some other actors a chance\" but I felt this was one of his strongest performances ever, especially the last few minutes.  The supporting actors, especially the pirates, were terrific.  In fact, you see their desperation and get an inside look into a subculture that actually brings understanding and perhaps even sympathy. Yes, if you know the story, you know what will in the end happen but how it happened (or at least how it was portrayed in the movie) is an incredible, emotional journey worth taking.",

            "content": "Captain Phillips manages to deliver a great movie with some of Tom Hanks best acting coupled with some fantastic set pieces. It tells the tale of the first US cargo ship to be captured in over 200 years and it's based on a true story. Starting off with mentions has to be the plot; now while in my personal opinion it was well paced, I never felt the level of tension I feel the film wanted to create. They weren't terrorists with military weapons like normal action movies; they were just 4 men with 2 AK's. Because of this and the fact that (spoiler) no civilians are hurt for the movie, I feel as if the opportunity was wasted. Now the thing is, in a movie review like this, I can't make too much criticisms like that as its based on a true story and its not like they can change the story tot he way I like it or would have preferred. This was an experience that a human being actually went through and I can't even believe how traumatizing it must have been. For that, the actor that was picked had to deliver a riveting performance so as to replicate what he actually went through; and ladies and gentlemen, Tom Hanks delivers. He's no action hero; or a person with a specific set of skills; he's just a normal guy who was driving a boat to deliver some supplies. The movie does a really great way of showing this by introducing you to his wife in the beginning and the fact that they're having trouble with their kids; it humanizes him in a way and throughout the movie, Phillips spends most of his time with a gun in his face, scared. He's  not stupid, mind you, which is shown in his attempts to help his crew while on the ship. The main relationship that is focused on is that of Phillips and Muse, the Somali captain. Abdi does a great job of portraying a fisherman/pirate and as they spend time together in the movie, Phillips begins to understand his character and its at its peak in the final act with a powerful scene. Speaking of which, the somalis' mostly didn't speak english and while this may have been a turn off for some, I thought it was a good idea as it helped to further show that they were foreign; of different worlds. Phillips, from america where anything is possible, and Muse, from Somali where he's pressured to get money and trapped in a life he can't get out of. It's the small conversations that showcase the profound simplicity of these characters, such as when Muse tells him that he always wanted to go to America and buy a car. As stated before, I felt like the tension wasn't what it could have been, but the final act was strong, with tense action scenes and great music. While the focus was on the relationship, I felt no connection for the other characters; I suppose this is because it was mainly Phillips' story that was being told. The cinematography must also be praised with glorious shots of the sea in its beauty along with the the sheer differences in size of the Navy and the somalian fisherman boat. It's as if it was a metaphor for how America is the dominant super-power and has all the resources while Somali is currently suffering based on the event of the movie. I can imagine that it won't be for everyone; as even though there are some good action sequences, what really carries this movie is the acting and the story, which culminates with a fair ending.  One last thing; the height of Hanks performance was definitely in the final 5 minutes when he's being rescued. When he's in shock and begins to break down, it was earth-shattering. I've dealt with patients who have been in shock and its like he mirrored them perfectly. Great Job, Mr. Hanks. Good movie. 8/10",

The storyline for this picture is very compelling and dramatic and actually reminded me of Zero Dark Thirty.  The premise is very original and I loved the characters.  The acting is perfect and the cast includes Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, Catherine Keener, and Corey Johnson.\n\n\"They're not here to fish.\"\n\nWe grabbed this movie from Redbox because it had received such great reviews.  This definitely deserves all of the positive feedback it has received, but isn't a movie I would watch more than one time.  Overall, this is a masterpiece worth a viewing but may not be a picture you need to add to your DVD collection because you'll only need to watch it once.\n\n\"I'll have two beers and a bucket of sin.\"\n\nGrade: A-",

It is hard to go into a film when you know the happy ending and expect any tension, and Captain Phillips fizzled rather than sparked. Barkhad Abdi is extremely underused and what little I saw was extremely overrated. I was actually more impressed by the other Somali actors than I was by him. Hanks was mindblowingly good in his final scene but for the two hours and twenty minutes preceding, I saw none of the talent that gave him back-to-back Oscars.

The only above average element of the film I thought was the story...so I'm not really sure why this film was nominated for best picture, so 3 stars for an average yet exciting film!",

You feel his grief but you also feel it for the Captain. The movie isn't jazzed up by Hollywood too much either, which I appreciated.

Captain Phillips are different comparing to other films in that it doesn't only shed light on the heroisms the American army, but also portrays the side of the Somalians. The film no doubt successfully increases the awareness of the severity of piracy. It is strange to me how the container ship Alabama has so little protection against these circumstances considering the water they are treading.

The sequences, the lighting, the sound effects...this film rocked my core! Tom Hanks is an immensely likable and good  actor and he proves his worth here...he's really good. But what really sold the film to me is Barkhad Abdi, a former limousine driver in his very first film. He's a natural and, weirdly enough, he had my sympathies throughout the film. I don't want him to die. Jail him or torture him, just don't kill him.

It is very effectively done and the final few scenes provide such a realistic portrayal of how such an ordeal affects an individual that I found it deeply upsetting. Tom Hanks takes the lead and this fine actor gives another masterclass in screen acting. He is simply brilliant as are his co-stars, especially the pirates, high on adrenaline and khat, who give a palpable depiction of their desperation. The scenes are well directed and the cramped and sweaty spaces of the ship corridors and lifeboat are well used to produce feelings of intense claustrophobia and panic.

It had that very casual, realistic feel to it.  For me, the key to a great movie is to make it as realistic and believable as possible, and this movie nails it.  There are several movies out there that are based on a true story, but end up being terrible films because the film makers get carried away with overacting and big budget effects.  But Captain Philips makes the viewer feel as though they could have been right there in the middle of the action as this event was happening.  It was very grounded, suspenseful, and even emotional at times.  I loved this movie.  And once again, Tom Hanks shines as an actor.  I give it 5 out of 5 stars.",

Basada en los hechos reales sobre la captura del Capitán Richard Phillips por piratas somalíes en el 2009. La elección de Tom Hanks en el papel principal es acertada y éste logra presentar con credibilidad y dramatismo un personaje que no busca ser un héroe, que no trata de impresionar a nadie, solo desea navegar en el mar, ser un buen capitán y sobretodo... sobrevivir. El resto del elenco no son conocidos y creo que más de uno, son sus primeros papeles, pero que eso no lo engañe, cada actor del elenco, en ambos lados del conflicto cumplen con sus roles y apoyan efectivamente a Tom Hanks. Un filme que logra sacar jugo a la tremenda fotografía que los cines aportan ahora presentando escenas impresionantes en sus enfoques. Genial uso de la música instrumental que se vuelve un aliado del director Greengrass para llevar al máximo el impacto de esta película que como antes comenté, no deja descansar al expectador y hace que uno viva cada escena, casi como si estuviera allí. La historia permite apreciar el peligroso trabajo que llevan a cabo los marinos mercantes cuando sus rutas los llevan a aguas demasiado cercanas a sectores controlados por piratas modernos, que lo más impresionante es ver que no ocupan grandes buques o grandes masas de hombres para poner en jaque a las embarcaciones comerciales, una simple lancha de motor con 4 sujetos armados basta para crear una crisis donde vidas están en peligro.

The director done a great job by making the audience feel that they are on the ship with Hanks. Personally, I couldn't believe that a shop that was carrying so much cargo, didn't have any security or weapons on board, especially as they were going through a territory that was known for kidnapping, but that just my personal opinion. The whole cast made the movie feel real and the director put together a brilliant cast, especially the Somalians who get just as much screen time as the Americans. Anyway, this is definitely a movie not to be missed.\n\nRound-Up:\nAfter watching the documentary on the DVD, it's amazing how much the director had to take into mind to get the story close to the true story. On top of the fact that a majority of the film is really set on a real boat and at sea, I think that the movie is extremely well put together, especially the ending when Hanks breaks down. As usual, Hanks is brilliant as Captain Phillips and I couldn't see anyone else playing his part. I'm glad that the film nearly quadrupled its budget, because it really does deserve it after all of the work that was put into it.\n\nBudget: $55million\nWorldwide Gross: $218million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there movie about a group of Somalians who kidnap a boat and it's crew for ransom. 8/10",

They knew they were traveling through pirate infested waters and NOT ONE individual packs any heat?!! \nNonsensical. Stupid.\nI mean, the end of the film was good. It's just that if one person would have had a gun, the remainder of the film would have been non-existent.\nJust a terribly dumb beginning and overall plot. Do large ships really travel without some sort of defense on board?!

A good adaptation of a true story about the highjackings of ships for ransom by Somali pirates in the first decade of the 2000's. It's really a story of two men going to work, albeit in different ways, to sustain their survival in life. Captain Phillips, in charge of taking a container ship through the Red Sea by the dangerous horn of Africa and Muse, the Somali pirate forced by the barrel of the gun to hijack ships for ransom for the notorious Somali warlords. The accidental relationship between the two men brought to light aspects of humanity in both. Captain Phillips as the concerned and caring father that achieved much already in his life and Muse as the young man with dreams of making it in a better world despite his violent and desperate circumstances. Would the story have been centered more about that complex relationship rather than the shifting of the focus on the action of the navy seals in the heroic rescue of captain Phillips, the movie would have been more impactant and deep. The action and the rescue made it into another heroic story of military rescue, Hollywood style, as if we needed more of that!",

Either because of the intensity or simply one scene, I can't bring myself to remove them from their boxes and put them into the Disc Tray again. Captain Phillips is one of those films. However, t is also powerfully acted on all accounts and beautifully done. Tom Hanks provides another amazing performance as Phillips and newcomer Barkhad Abdi, who plays the pirate captain, shows why he deserved his Oscar Nom. The film is at the beginning, eerie. It depicts a simple, day by day account of what Phillips does on every ship. And when the pirates arrive, it's a slow burn like nothing else. The story takes several twists, all well written, thanks to Billy Ray's Script, and well acted. Every performer in this film is great down to the steely eyed navy seals waiting on the edge of the boat. But it's not until the last 10 minutes that the intensity almost kills you. And when you see Phillips last shot of the film, you will be searching for words to describe it. 4.9/5",

            "content": "It must be hard not to like Tom Hanks. He's always seemed like such a jovial, fun-loving person, the kind of guy you can have a few drinks with at a party and just laugh and laugh at his stories and anecdotes.\n\nAnd, lest we forget, the man is one hell of an actor.\n\nI don't know Tom Hanks. I've never spent any time with him, nor have I ever even met him personally. Therefore, I can't verify anything in my first paragraph above. These are just impressions I get from the guy, and from these impressions, I'm making guesses. It's all just speculation.\n\nBut there's no speculation involved in the sentence directly preceding the above paragraph. That is a cold, hard fact. I don't need to go through the man's filmography to illustrate this, but if you're looking for recent proof, just rent \"Captain Phillips.\" You'll get all the proof you need...and maybe then you'll understand my shock that the guy was somehow snubbed of a Best Actor nomination this year.\n\nThe funny thing is that, as much as \"Captain Phillips\" is a showcase for Hanks' ability as an actor, it's also quite easy to forget you're watching a performance (or even a movie, at times). Despite his star power, I often forgot I was watching Tom Hanks. He simply BECAME Captain Richard Phillips of New Jersey. The movie sometimes takes on a documentary-like feel. That's how effective both Hanks and the film really are. Like fellow Best Picture nominee \"Gravity,\" \"Captain Phillips\" is a masterful example of a prolonged exercise in tension.\n\nAs the film opens, Captain Richard Phillips (Hanks) is piloting the container ship MV Maersk Alabama to Mombasa, Kenya. This is a perilous venture because the route is going to take the ship past the coast of Somalia, a hotspot for pirate activity. Sure enough, the ship is attacked and eventually boarded by a small band of Somali pirates, led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi). They plan on ransoming the ship and crew for millions of dollars in insurance money from the shipping company.\n\nThis is a recent story, so there's a good chance most audience members will be familiar with how this plays out. But that does nothing to diminish the white-knuckled tension permeating throughout the movie. Captain Phillips does his best to placate his pirate aggressors, but they're like a powder keg waiting to go off; one wrong move, and everybody dies. And although they're clearly destitute, they're certainly not simpletons, especially their leader, Muse. He's intelligent, calculating, and--perhaps most dangerous of all--determined.\n\nDirector Paul Greengrass utlizes the same gritty, shaky-cam technique of his previous efforts (including \"United 93,\" \"The Bourne Ultimatum,\" and the underrated \"Green Zone\") and the effect is intoxicating and claustrophobic, and I mean that as a compliment. There are times when we feel like we're right there with Phillips and his captors.\n\nHanks' performance is about as real and raw as you can get, but I must also praise Somali newcomer Barkhad Abdi as the pirate leader. It's always risky to cast newcomers or non-actors in major roles opposite big name stars (e.g., Clint Eastwood's \"Gran Torino\"), but Abdi goes toe-to-toe with Hanks, even managing to garner some sympathy for the desperate Muse. We get the sense that he is not an evil man; he's simply playing the hand he was dealt. The movie doesn't make excuses for his actions, but it does dare the audience to think about what they would do if they were in his shoes.\n\n\"Captain Phillips\" is the kind of film that leaves you gasping and feeling wrung-out. It's merciless and unrelenting, but the efforts of Hanks, Abdi and Greengrass make it an extraordinary film. You should definitely check it out.",

I think \"Captain Phillips\" is trying to do something good, and I even think it accomplishes its worthy goals to a large degree, and I'm certainly not going to complain about Greengrass' choice to eschew sentimentality (at least until the final few minutes) in favor of a more objective, procedural approach, but I'm left with the feeling that we're never provided enough context. Not enough context for the action to be coherent, in certain cases, too much context, in a way, for the suspense to be suspenseful (knowing going in that Phillips escapes relatively unharmed really deflates the dramatic sails), not enough context for me to really connect with any of the characters beyond the most superficial level, and not enough context for the larger issues it's tackling to really mean much.",

Hanks is obviously great but Abdi is the true star of the show, sympathetic while never sinking anywhere near some \"pirate with a heart of gold\" cliche.

The excellent pacing and tense atmosphere found in the film's first half basically disappear.  The film quickly becomes repetitive: the kidnappers threaten Phillips, he begs them not to hurt him, and finds some way to convince them to not hurt him; he then continues to find ways to undermine them.  Splice in some shots of people negotiating with the kidnappers and the SEALs readying their weapons on the Navy destroyer, rinse and repeat.  The film just keeps showing the same stuff over and over again for the last 45 minutes, and it really almost kills the film.  It certainly makes it drag, and having been, well, enraptured by the first half, I find myself losing interest and becoming bored.

Even a crappy ass FN show like Guy Fieri & Rachael Ray's Washed Up, Dried up Post-Rehab Celebrity Cook-Off. \nThe only reason I sat through Captain Phillips was due to its Best Picture Oscar nomination.  To which I say to the Academy: Really?  REALLY?\n\tCaptain Phillips is a tediously long, drawn out, anti-action, illogical, impractical bore.\n\tPaul Greengrass might have been successful employing his hand-held, unsteady cam technical approach in United 93.  But that technique here makes the film come across as a shaky, rocky and distracting (from the tension of the character based drama) failure.  Captain Phillips is not Cloverfield.  Plus it takes place on a freighter - not  in a canoe.  \n\tAnother thing  -  the completely wasted and trite 2 minute opening sequence.  Where Captain Richard Phillips leaves his home accompanied by his wife (Kathleen Keener, forgettable) for the sole reason of \"grounding\" an engaging, concerning, serious moment where they discuss the security and safey of his job.  Greengrass should have just cut this cardboard, poorly written, ineffective bit. Cut.  It. Out. Leave it on the editing floor.  Along with the rest of the movie.\n\tAnother thing - the Somali pirates.  There were no subtitles.   Don't think it was the version I watched.  But .... what the hell were they talking about?  What the hell were they saying?  Physical and emotional reactions are one thing.  Yet when you can't understand the language, you technically have a HARDER time getting into their characters.  Which honest I did much at all.    I would completely understand if they didn't have subtitles during the moments when the Somalians were taking the ship hostage.  Such lack of subtitles could have been successful in invoking a feeling of the shipmates inability of understanding  what was being said.  Which would have installed a definite sense of tension and fearfulness.  Yet at the beginning when the pirate captain (Barkhad Abdi, who looked too similar to most of the other Somalian pirates/actors in the film which made him loose a deeper sense of identity)  was choosing his other band mates, I felt I could not connect to the importance nor the intensity of the scene.\n\tAnother thing - the implausibility of the whole hostage take over.  So a ship carrying cargo through treacherous international waters not auto-guarded by the UN to third world war inflicted countries doesn't have guns?  Of any short?  Besides flare missels?  Really?  REALLY?  Mathematically speaking, the MV Maersk Alabama had a crew of what?  Twelve? Sixteen? Even more?  Against a band of 4 or 5 pirates?  Huh?  Yes the pirates did have automatic machine guns.  But like Captain Phillips speechified before they were boarded: \"Remember that you know the ship.  They don't.\" So a macho-men crew of 12+ on their own \"home turf\"  couldn't take The Expendables gutsy action to devise a plan to fight back?  Sigourney Weaver done it.  Jodi Foster has done it.  Angelia Jolie even.  But shipmen can't?   Really?  REALLY?  Sure.  Fine.  Whatever.  To me I just find it implausible and completely unbelievable. \n\tOne last thing before I let your eyeballs go... or you stab me with your \"Ryan I LOVED IT! You overly critical bastard\" pitchfork.   Tom Hanks.  Tom Hanks doesn't drive me to watch anything.  From the previews Tom Hank's attempt at an accent even turned me off (in the movie it's completely inconsistent.  And still annoying).  His acting and embodiment of Richard Phillips - except for a handful of scenes - is that of a fearful, timid man.  And at times gutless. Especially on the lifeboat where Greengrass resorts to close-ups of Hank's petrified, sweaty face to provoke an empathic  reaction out of us.  Then when Hanks speaks the assigned banal and uninspiring dialogue, it completely dissolves any sympathy and tension.  The one recent Tom Hanks role (or roles) where I actually enjoyed him in was Cloud Atlas.  Otherwise, his only memorable movies to me were The Green Mile (1999), Forrest Gump (1994), and iconically BIG (1984).  RIP Esteemed Actor Tom Hanks, RIP.",

            "content": "Is it strange that I found A Hijacking to feel a little more real than this film, even though the former isn't based on a true story and the latter is.  A Hijacking, if you're unaware, is a film detailing a similar situation to this film except it also looks at the emotional stress of those handling the hostage negotiation, on top of the duress the crew goes through during their ordeal.  It is an excellent film, but a quietly intense one at that.  If you're stuck between watching this or A Hijacking and you're looking for a film heavy on \"action\" and suspense, then this film is the way to go.  But if you love films, you'll go out of your way to watch both.  The thing about A Hijacking is the fact that it focuses more on the negotiations between the pirates and the company that owns the ship.  There's a lot of going back and forth between them, so the film is very dialogue heavy, and some of the most important scenes in the film, such as the hijacking itself, are done off-screen.  So the film subverts expectations for this genre of film, it's a little more understated and, therefore, a little more realistic.  Not to take anything away from this film, and I don't doubt anything that happened in this film, but I also found it to be like a heavily dramatized account of the real life story.  And that's understandable, particularly if you want a wide audience to invest in your story, you exaggerate things a little bit more for the dramatic effect.  Again, I don't doubt that this was a horrific thing that happened to the people on the ship and, later, to Captain Phillips after he's taken hostage on the lifeboat, but the film is a little bit more dramatically manipulative than it probably wants to let on.  That doesn't mean that the dramatic freedoms they took made the film worse.  In actuality, I think that's why part of the film is as good as it is.  Paul Greengrass knows how to direct intense and suspenseful movies, and this film is no different.  He's got the same cinema-verite style that makes it feel like you're almost part of the crew stuck in the same situation, I think the uncertainty of the situation translates incredibly thanks to its cinematography and camerawork.  With that said, while I complain about the film not feeling like an accurate representation of what happened, that doesn't mean that the style in which the film was presented is bad, or anything of the sort.  Again, for what Paul Greengrass is trying to present, it works perfectly.  It's just strange finding a film, that's inspired by real-life events but not actually based on one, feel more realistic than a film that IS based on a real-life situation.  That doesn't speak, at all, to the quality of each individual film.  It's just an observation.  But moving on, I did find that the movie, after the pirates take captain Phillips hostage on the lifeboat, slows down...almost to a complete halt.  Almost as slow as the lifeboat they were in on, like they were just trying to kill time before the climax came.  Not that I can blame them for that, you need to pace yourself before the big climax...that's more than understandable.  You need the lows in order to appreciate the highs even more.  If the film had been a constant high, then you'd have been numbed by it all by the end of the film.  But I still think that they could've shortened these parts up a bit in order to make the film tighter and more concise.  Regardless of its length, I still found this film to be an easy watch, but there's still some stuff that could've been cut out that wasn't needed.  With that said, the actual climax of the film itself, with the Navy Seals trying to secure the targets in the lifeboat, was outstanding and probably the main reason the film gets the rating it did.  Greengrass has this way of just getting the most out of these situations.  If it takes him 20 minutes to get where he needs to go, then so be it, but he's doing it for a reason.  He's doing it in order to create tension, suspense, and the uncertainty that something may happen that could fuck all this up, even if you know of the real life case.  So props to Greengrass and the crew for doing this like true pros.  Tom Hanks is outstanding, but what else do you expect from him.  He's strong and commanding, yet incredibly vulnerable at the same time.  He doesn't know if he's gonna make it out alive out of this situation, so the fact that he manages to stay so calm in this situation rather than breaking out in hysterics is a testament to Hanks' strengths as an actor.  I liked the story as well as it, in a more understated manner, highlights the problem that globalization has on the economy of some of these third-world countries.  Not that the film paints a favorable portrait of the pirates, which it doesn't, but it does give a potential reason for why they've decided to become pirates.  So the film is much more than just the hijacking.  If you can, seek out both this and A Hijacking because they're equally as different but for completely different reasons.",

            "content": "Films that are based on true events are hit or miss - sometimes they are accused of taking artistic liberties to overdramatize aspects of the story, and other times they fall victim to trying to stay so close to what really happened that they become more of a documentary than intended. 'Captain Phillips' toes this line exceptionally well, as the Paul Greengrass film is powerful, attention-grabbing and believable. The film takes a look at the events of April 2009 when the cargo ship Maersk Alabama was seized by Somali pirates off the horn of Africa and its captain, Richard Phillips, was taken hostage and subsequently rescued by SEAL Team Six. The event lends itself to being depicted in an exciting manner on film, and Greengrass does not squander this opportunity. The cinematography feels real. Gritty. Harrowing. The music, aided by a score from Henry Jackman, successfully conveys the tone and gravity of the events that transpired. And then there's the acting. It's hard to believe Tom Hanks was not rewarded for his portrayal of Phillips with an Academy Award nomination, especially considering his performance in the final moments of the film. Additionally it's worth recognizing the jobs done by the actors who played the Somali pirates, including Barkhard Abdi, who was in fact rewarded with an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor. The setting of the high seas was another element that brought 'Captain Phillips' to life, as there really is nowhere to run, and less places to hide. Regardless of whether everything in 'Captain Phillips' is depicted how these events actually happened in reality, it is one of the most interesting, exciting films of 2013.",

Hanks' true costars in this flick aren't so much US Navy SEALs but rather a well-cast group of actors portraying the terrorists and his crewmembers. The backdrop of the Maersk Alabama completely befuddles the bad guys and gets them off their game in a way not seen since Bruce Willis' character in 'Die Hard' eye-poked terrorists throughout the Nakatomi building in 1988. Easily Tom Hanks' best performance since 'Cast Away'. Drop anchor and go see it. Remember, they're not here to fish. Grade: B+",

It doesn't follow action movie rules and makes every moment feel real, making it seem authentic rather than a Hollywood-ized version of the actual event. This is helped with believable acting headed by Tom Hanks (who got snubbed at the Oscars this year) and a great job of humanizing the Somalian pirate Muse (Barkhad Abdi). He could have been a Die Hard-on-a-boat villain, but there's reason to why he does what he does.\n\nI compare it most to Zero Dark Thirty, where it's not really an action movie, but a dramatic film with action elements.

The motivations of characters in Greengrass's films are never black and white. Captain Phillips manages to take a story that everyone already knows and make it intense and unpredictable. You'll find as you watch the movie that you don't know as many details as you think you did about this incredible incident. It is masterfully acted and directed. The script is sparse and feels very natural. Its such a rare combination to find a film that combines directing, acting, and writing to create the depth of character found in this movie.

You'd better think about it; I just can't live without it, so please don't take my ship from me!\" Now that I've released the Grand Funk Railroad that always gets stuck in my head whenever I see films about the overthrowing of a ship captain, for those of you who kind of want \"Saving Mr. Banks\" to actually relate to \"Saving Private Ryan\", don't worry, because in 2013, Captain John Miller really is back to war, and this time, he takes to the sea against... pirates. I'm sorry, but in this day and age, I find it kind of amusingly awkward to call modern pirates \"pirates\", although it's not like we can call them terrorists, not just because that's not necessarily what they are, but because when you hear about a Paul Greengrass film about a terrorist highjacking, you can't help but think of \"United 93 II: We're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat\". Hey, I'd rather they call it that as opposed to \"Crimson Tide II\", because I don't want people to start thinking about how bad stuff always seems to happen to ships named after my beloved Alabama. Well, maybe people will just think that bad stuff always happens to any kind of craft when it's commanded by Tom Hanks. Oh, Houston, we most certainly have a problem indeed, but, it sure does make for a good film, although, make no mistake, there actually are some problems here.\r\n\r\nIts storytelling assurance limited, the film often conforms to near-Hollywoodistically manipulative structural conventions as a heroic action thriller, hitting plenty of tropes, but limiting conventions by limiting depth to the flesh-out of potentially formulaic characters. That being the case, I suppose you could say that underdevelopment things a sense of genericism, but more than that it thins a sense of human impact, which is there, sure, yet undercut by little placement of attention into the protagonists and antagonists who we are trapped with in a tense, ostensibly character-driven thriller. It's ultimately hard to not feel as though you know little about the well-portrayed, but undercooked characters behind a well-told but dramatically filed down narrative that still takes its time to drag along with repetitious, if not aimless meditations upon tension building through anything from exhausting action set pieces to meandering thoughtful moments. The film ultimately outstays its welcome, essentially compensating for excessiveness with predominant effectiveness, yet either bloating or meandering, while placing only so much attention on characterization, resulting in a coldness to storytelling which is made all the more distancing by inconsistencies in tonal intensity. While storytelling meanders, extended periods of subtle tension are never less than adequately intriguing, until broken by many a spell of quiet dryness which loses tension and stiffens pacing, blanding things up, if not dulling things down, and consistently allowing you to meditate upon the structural shortcomings by marking highlights in misfires in ambition. Perhaps director Paul Greengrass tries a touch too hard to mold a meditative, if still rather Hollywood thriller, yet as much as I complain, inspiration matches ambition enough for the strengths of the film to be considerable, while flaws rarely prove to be as considerable as I make them sound, resulting in a consistently compelling effort, but one whose potential is too betrayed by Hollywood conventions, underdevelopment and inconsistencies in pacing for the final product to stand as strong as I was hoping, much less as strong as many are saying. I wish the film could have hit harder, but make no bones about it, it still hits pretty hard, with plenty of inspiration behind the handling of a worthy story concept.\r\n\r\nI suppose the wealth of depth was always to be limited by the sheer minimalism to the subject matter of this claustrophobic dramatic thriller, but the subject matter is still rich with potential for layered intensity that is brought to life by highlights in scripting by Billy Ray that may be undercooked and overblown, but is generally controlled enough in its thoughtful storytelling and set piece drawing to do a serviceable job of fleshing out intensity. Yeah, the selling of depth and tension could be more than simply serviceable, but Ray's script has enough sharpness to its clever dialogue and tightness to its narrative structuring to make up for limitations in depth enough to endear, though not as much as the directorial execution of Ray's script. Paul Greengrass' direction is itself flawed, with sometimes unsubtly conventional, if not blandly dry atmospherics, but it's generally very effective, with stylish plays on Henry Jackman's brooding score work, thumping sound design and realistic handheld camera filming that immerse you into bitingly well-staged action sequences, enhanced by a fair degree of thoughtfulness to the more human aspects. The underdevelopment of the human aspects defuse much of the dramatic impact which could have driven the final product a long way, but Greengrass does what he can with only so much, and ultimately grips with smartly stylish intensity, while the performers round out the value of compellingness to this character-driven dramatic thriller. Material is, of course, thinner than many are saying, though just about everyone delivers as best he can, whether he be among the threatened crew members whose portrayers project a relatable nervousness, or among the Somalian antagonists whose portrayers project an unnerving harshness, particularly the chilling primary antagonist Barkhad Abdi. Of course, the man who really powers this film is leading man Tom Hanks, who, to tell you the truth, remains held back by limitations in material, being initially not allowed to do anything beyond project a distinguished charisma that sells the collectiveness and stature of a worthy captain in a situation that calls for a strong leader, but really engrossing when the plot thickens and the conflict grows weightier, for Hanks effortlessly nails the dramatic range that encompasses anguish and heroic intensity through powerful dramatic layering. Hanks ranks among the most important actors in modern film, maybe of all time, and he hasn't been given the material to firmly remind of this lately, with even this performance truly shining in moments that arrive too late for Hanks to be considered all-out great on the whole, but when Hanks gets his chance, he cuts deep with one of the better performances of 2013, which isn't to say that there's ever a point where Hanks does anything less than utilize effortlessly assured charisma to carry this thriller, which, when backed by inspiration within Greengrass as an offscreen lead, perseveres through its limitations and achieves, maybe not the strength I was hoping for, but rewarding strength nonetheless.\r\n\r\nBottom line, Hollywood action thriller conventions and little attention to characterization distance depth, while an excessive length and some dulling atmospheric dry spells really shake the impact of the final product, which is still kept from being shaken all that much by the worthy story concept, decent script, solidly intense direction and strong acting - especially by leading man Tom Hanks - that make \"Captain Phillips\" a tensely compelling dramatization of a harrowing modern pirate scenario.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

The film juxtaposes the United States and Somalia to no effect other than to great build-up to when the pirates attack the vessel. When the pirates do attack it, we have wonderful suspense scenes that evoke a feeling of uneasiness and genuine fear. Greengrass succeeds in establishing that these are people who have separate lives and their deaths mean something - the stakes are thus higher. Barkad Abdi's performance was very weak, one-dimensional, and boring. I'm only criticizing the fact that it was nominated for an Oscar! Tom Hanks, on the other hand, gathers all his energy to bring one of his best performances, but it falls flat. His New England accent, and heroic performance that builds a complex character falls flat due to the weak writing. When he starts crying, it was the weaker part. Greengrass gives him useless dialogue to maintain his performance instead of letting Hanks act emotions with his face and body. What happens at the rest of the film is that it is a huge military advertisement without answering key questions: Where is the military during the attack? Why did Phillips risk the lives of his crew members? Why is all this money thrown away on soldiers who take on only three skinny pitiful pirates? No, what the film does is it becomes Hollywood sentimental. The pirates are poor fishermen and the military is a hero. The film is stuck in the middle and doesn't know which side to choose. In the end, Captain Phillips is a really enjoyable film, but not a very good one attributed to its lackluster messages and ideals as well as mediocre film-making.",

The acting is outstanding, and when every actor involved gives such a riveting performance it makes for a very believable and intense experience. But the film does have a big problem: it's length.

The story was slow to pull in my attention and it lulled at moments, but it chugged along and ultimately did its duty well. Visually impressive and raw cinematography add to the gritty and harsh realism of the situation Captain Phillips, his crew, and the pirates endured. Tom Hanks' performance was nothing short of quality, as usual, and the ending scenes were an emotional powerhouse. Simply riveting! It literally brought me to tears. The supporting cast were equally believable and captivating in their roles. I especially like the way the story gave an understanding perspective of the Somali pirates. \nThese pirates were people were trying to make a living just like the rest of us. Their fish had been depleted by foreign commercial fishing ships and their options were running low concerning their survival. Captain Philips implored to Muse (the head pirate), \"There must be something other than fishing and kidnapping people.\" Muses' sobering response of \"Maybe in America\" forces us to realize that despite our country's hardships, we are still so very lucky to be in such a place where we know there is no way we can starve. These men are so skinny, as they truly are, it is understandable they would resort to piracy. However, I have to agree with Phillips: there has to be something else you can do to thrive other than hurting other people, no matter where you live. \nThe Somali pirates' greed eventually led to their downfall. They could have take the 30 thousand dollars and ran, but they wanted more by taking Phillips hostage. So it is difficult for me to fell much remorse about the fact that they in the end, they simply end up with their heads full of lead. Perhaps the only innocent casualty was the young pirate who did not know any better than to come along and do his job. \"I didn't think something like this would happen,\" he cries.\nThis movie is very watchable, it is realistic, not overplayed, and the ending will have you locked in your seat. They could have ended the movie with the killing of the pirates, but that would not have done the story justice. I am so so glad they took the time to show the emotional aftermath of the traumatized Captain Phillips which in my opinion deliver the best scenes of the movie.\nI give \"Captain Phillips\" 4 out of 5 stars.",

The film was nominated six times at the last Academy Award Ceremony. Recommended by a friend, I was pleasantly surprised by the intensity of the movie. You literary sit on the edge of your seat as the brilliant Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump, Cloud Atlas) tries to keep his head cool during a hijacking. \n\nLeaving his family behind for several weeks to take command of a containership in Oman, captain Richard Philips (Hanks) must sail to the dangerous territory round the Horn of Africa. During one of the practice drills to prevent hijackers from entering, two little vessels show up on the radar. A group of young Somali criminals are approaching heavily armed. Captain Philips orders the crew to put the boat into full speed to outrun them. But the leader of the gang, Abduwali Muse, is not giving up that easily. He wants to hijack the containership because it is worth millions of American dollars. When Muse and three of his men get onboard, captain Philips faces the most fearful time of his life. Can he come to an agreement with the pirates so nobody gets hurt?",

Because I am going to hold you hostage with a plethora of puns in yet another film review voyage upon my pun-man ship. Please don't jump off!! OK, I am going to bring you my insight of the masterful movie \"Captain Phillips\". The film is based on the real life 2009 incident where cargo ship capitan Richard Phillips was taken hostage on a cargo lifeboat by four Somali pirates. Tom Hanks pitch-perfect starring performance as the title character was on board as one of the best acting efforts of the year. It's too bad the Academy rocked the boat when they left Hanks off the Best Actor Oscar nominee list. Newcomer Somalian actor Barkhad Abdi's freshman effort as the Somalian pirate leader Muse was a gem. Abdi's facial expressions alone were worthy of all the acting accolades his performance has received. Director Paul Greengrass has once again proved that the green is always richer on our side when he is orchestrating suspense action films based on true stories. Greengrass anchors \"Captain Phillips\" quite swiftly, just as he perfectly piloted \"United 93\". Billy Ray's screenplay was very compelling and included what probably is the movie catchphrase of the year \"I'm the captain now\". So whether you pirate this movie or not (recommending the latter of course), you should take a look at \"Captain Phillips\".\n ***** Excellent",

Important to acknowledge this idea that, perhaps they got these 4 hijackers, but there are 50 men who will fill each of their spots immediately because of Samilia's problems.

It is a retaliation of the vicious circle from the poverty-stricken to the hegemony which sardonically offers them the alms and simultaneously capitalizes on their natural resources and weaponry merchandizing, so it is not easy to hold a phlegmatic perspective to watch the man-made terror without deploring the sad truth how things have ended up like this, for sure we should inveigh against the piracy felony, all the same we should also see through the phenomena and ferret out the nitty-gritty which induces the atrocious tragedies. We have both parties to blame and need a soul-searching examination on our own conscience. \n\nGreengrass adopts an engaging procedure to re-enact the white-knuckle happening of how the ship is seized by four Somali pirates (leading by a scrawny Muse, played by the first-time actor, now Oscar-nominee Abdi), parallels the narrative from both sides, playing mind games and a hide-and-seek inside the vessel, this is the first half, culminated with the pirates take captain Phillips as the hostage in a lifeboat, floating back the Somali. Apparently from the hindsight, it is a preventable incident, considering it is a US cargo ship, no one on board is equipped with any firearms at all? From a gun frenzy country where campus shooting is rampant, it is quite implausible, but sometimes the truth is as simple as that, the pirates' boarding process is rough and ready, clearly the affluent corporate which owns the ship skimps on its defense system, although they are fully aware of the potential peril could happen anytime. Otherwise, there would be no big deal to defeat four sea marauders (one is barely a child) even they're equipped with AK-18.\n\nAnyway, the second half, Captain Phillips is held captive within a lifeboat with the pirates on the billowy sea, since then, the film heavily hinges on Hank's performance to emanate the brewing desperation during the so-called \"negotiation\" between US rescue team (SEAL, frogmen are all standby) and the cornered pirates four. It is a precious platform to let Hanks finally have something extraordinary to offer, he completes it with consummate precision and sublimates the predictable fallout of the false hope. Unfortunately due to a crammed year with sterling candidates, Hanks is left out of the nomination list, quite an upsetting snub, but he plays a real person who lacks for a distinctive character except he is under an extreme situation, not showy enough is the detrimental disadvantage. Abdi is the MVP among the pirates four, not as irritable and impatient as the hackneyed short-fuse Najee (Ahmed), he is a human being with flesh and blood, he is the one captain Phillips can relate to under such circumstances, all diversities aside, basically they both work for their respective bosses and want to finish their jobs with minimal casualties. His bold final move can be interpreted as a smart judgment call, his American dream ironically fulfills in a different way, at least he can be plumb free of his ill-destined fate. \n\nNominated for 6 Oscars including BEST PICTURE (both Hanks and Greengrass are brutally snubbed here), CAPTAIN PHILLIPS is at best an unbiased recount of a man's individual struggle during a hanging-by-a-thread ride, and at worst, it is an unimaginative hostage story with jejune perpetrators wield weapons and demand unrealistic ransom, no one can beat the principled USS army, do you get the message?",
