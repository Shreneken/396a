The plot is kind of a mess with things way out of left field in a bad way and there are some over the top sequences that are far fetched for even a movie like this (the sick stick) but it's nevertheless pretty funny at times. The only good things about this movie are some of the humor and the introduction of even more unique and interesting heroes with a comedic angle to them, and I get that that's what this movie was trying to be to begin with. Plus, it cheapens and discounts the significance of quite a few deaths in the movie as well which felt frustrating instead of funny. Major characters or at least people who are important to the major characters die way to quick and easy with no time to breathe!",

            "content": "The first film was incredibly entertaining and a huge breath of fresh air. This sequel is not as bad as all that and there are far worse sequels about, in fact it is quite watchable, but compared to its predecessor it does fall well short. It's still slickly edited, the colours dazzle with no garishness or drabness, the costumes are still a lot of fun and the effects are incredible. The shaky cam while effective in some scenes was too much in others though. The music is breezy, adrenaline-pumping and catchy, if not quite as fitting as the soundtrack in the first. The witty, edgy humour and the (even more) violent, tense action sequences still remain and with little diminished impact, the climax is incredibly exciting. Admittedly some of it does get violent to the point of being too much to stomach for some, it wasn't a problem with me but parts could have toned down a tad. The dialogue is not as fresh as the first's but still quite witty and irreverent. It is the story where Kick Ass 2 falls down on most, it is lacking in the lively pace of the original, due to some overlong and draggy scenes, and there are a lot of tone shifts that are rather abrupt and awkwardly done, there is a bit of trying to do too much quality. The high school/trying to fit in subplot always is a nice idea but again very little fresh or interesting is done with it, it does drag the pace down with the most uninteresting scenes being to do with this particular subplot and it does feel out of sorts with the rest of the film. Of course there are enough fun, exciting and at times emotional moments but not enough to hide how problematic the story is. The supporting characters are colourful enough especially the main antagonist, Mother Russia and Colonel Stars and Stripes but the leads feel underdeveloped and not always easy to root for, certainly nowhere near as colourful, if anything while well played their personalities are bland. The acting is good enough, although John Leguizamo is very much wasted and Christopher Mintz-Plasse while fine as Chris over-compensates a little as the villain(I would say his name but the guidelines have a thing about prohibited words). Chloe Grace Moretz carried the film brilliantly though and Aaron Johnson is just as confident. Jim Carrey is also wonderfully refreshing and a more than pleasing presence. Overall, a watchable sequel but the first Kick Ass kicks ass much, much better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "A worthy sequel, if a missed opportunity to focus more on superheroine Hit-Girl.\n\nJeff Wadlow directs a surprisingly entertaining and well crafted sequel with his pleasantly heartfelt and enthralling superhero action-comedy Kick-Ass 2 (2013). I'd heard that Kick-Ass 2 doesn't compare to the original, as few sequels ever do, but Wadlow does a fine job directing a pretty and stylized comic book thriller in the vein of Matthew Vaughn's eccentric directorial style for the first film Kick-Ass (2010). Kick-Ass 2's violent action is even more brutal with bursts of blood and shocking gore. From Joe Howard's comic book aesthetic for his art direction to make-up artist Bill Corso's bruised and bloody make-up, Kick-Ass 2 is raw.\n\nJeff Wadlow wrote Kick-Ass 2 with help from Kick-Ass creators Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. with a bit of referential love towards anything from Batman to Mean Girls or Carrie. Wadlow keeps Matthew Vaughn's immature and frenetic writing tone with a quick wit with visceral sequences. The earnest portrayal of Kick-Ass' innocence and naivety is still fun as is his dynamic between his fellow super-heroes. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is amazing as Kick-Ass. He is funny, silly, embarrassed, sincere, and even cool as needed with thoughtfulness and vulnerability. Taylor-Johnson gets to show off his versatility, charisma, and personality in Kick-Ass 2 in a solid return to form for his quirky hero Kick-Ass and endearing Dave Lizewski.\n\nI do think Wadlow wasted the perfect opportunity to make a Hit-Girl standalone film or at least give Chloe Grace Moretz a bigger role as she was the highlight for anyone who saw Kick-Ass. My only gripe is that Hit-Girl feels underpowered compared to her endless kill streaks from the first movie, but she does get some killer moments here that I genuinely loved to see. \n\nChloe Grace Moretz is convincing as this foul mouthed superheroine with skillful fight sequences and natural confidence as the captivating Hit-Girl. Moretz steals the show again with heartfelt dramatic acting that is subtle, while her action sequences are anything but nuanced with hard hits everywhere. She nails Mindy Macready going through the awful American high school experience of Mean Girls and Carrie fashion with a sincerely adorable and sympathetic performance. I hope Moretz continues to get lead actress roles from here on as I loved her in Kick-Ass, Kick-Ass 2, and Hugo.\n\nChristopher Mintz-Plasse is perfect as the rich, racist, sexist, scumbag supervillain The Mother Fucker. He's just gleefully chewing the scenery as this whiney jerk who cannot live up to his father's name. Mintz-Plasse perhaps goes too far with the attempted rape scene and the flaccid joke therein because it's just tasteless instead of gritty. Kick-Ass 2 does lean into the edgy Mark Millar territory too often. Clark Duke's Battle Guy is quite funny like his Marty character in Kick-Ass.\n\nJim Carrey is seriously awesome as Colonel Stars and Stripes with his cute dog Eisenhower. I must commend his commitment to looking menacing and feeling commanding as Colonel Stars and Stripes. His action parts look tough and convincingly brutal, while Carrey dons this deeper dramatic voice, adding some genuine gravitas to Kick-Ass 2. He's as great as Nicolas Cage's Big Daddy from Kick-Ass to me. I have to say I liked seeing Carrey acting more sincerely with a fantastic dramatic part since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or The Truman Show than his old comedy days of yore.\n\nJohn Leguizamo is excellent as Javier, helping the villain assemble his team and questioning his decisions. Garrett M. Brown is wonderful as Kick-Ass' father with his wise words of advice and grounded sense of reality. Iain Glen's cameo as Uncle Ralph is phenomenal within a few brief minutes, you feel his expansive power and evil menace. Lindy Booth is really gorgeous as the redhead superheroine Night Bitch. You feel so bad for her! Very cool to see early supporting roles from Daniel Kaluuya as Black Death, Benedict Wong as Mr. Kim, Ella Purnell as Dolce, Claudia Lee as hot mean girl leader Brooke. I appreciated them getting Lyndsy Fonseca back as Katie Deauxma for a funny scene alongside her hilarious friend Erika Cho, played by the cute Sophie Wu.\n\nMorris Chestnut is good as Detective Marcus Williams, but he feels like he's just there to defend morality and cops, which is so lame. Hit-Girl should have left to live on her own earlier than the end. Donald Faison is funny as Doctor Gravity with just his baseball bat. I hated Augustus Prew as a bargain bin version of Evan Peters, who he replaced as Todd the Ass Kicker. He's just awkward and not as funny or quick witted as Peters.\n\nEddit Hamilton's editing is fairly sharp and doesn't waste time for a very fast paced 103 minutes of fun comedy parodying superheroes, while quickly cutting to action shots. Tim Maurice-Jones' cinematography nearly looks as good as the first Kick-Ass with a nice dedication to compelling close-ups with beautiful framing, while all the action can be clearly seen during Maurice-Jones' ultra wide shots. Russell De Rosario's production design gives homes a realistic feel, while the hero hideout looks homemade. Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson's score is exciting with pulse pounding themes for the darker action and emotional melodies for Kick-Ass' main theme.\n\nIn short, more Hit-Girl please.",

Kick Ass himself isn't much more than a passive observer in all this, waffling between 'I should dress up' and 'I shouldn't dress up' with motivations being iffy at best ('my dad died, so I should NOT be a superhero' - HUH????).  Other superheros seemed tacked on with random backstories and horrible outfits.  Hit Girl loses her confidence?  Red Mist is back, and not in a good way as Mother Lover.  He at least seems a bit self aware that the whole situation is absurd - I think the movie could have used more self aware humor the way it gets deployed in Deadpool.  And John Leguizamo is in this!  WTF?   The whole time he is rolling his eyes, ostensibly at Mother Lover's requests, but probably more like 'how did I end up here?'\n\tAgain, it SOUNDS bad, and incoherence is one of my pet peeves, but it was kinda fun and campy and over the top fun to watch.",

            "content": "SCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) Once again, Greg, we see ordinary people kicking some not-so-ordinary ass.\n\nGREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) It s time for round two of everyman superheroes.\n\nSCOTT: Kick-Ass 2 begins three years after the first installment of the series.  Dave  (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is now a high school senior and has retired his superhero persona.  Mindy (Chlo  Grace Moretz) has grown into a freshman and is still Hit-Girl, although she is careful to conceal this identity from her guardian Marcus (Morris Chestnut). When Marcus discovers that Mindy is still a superhero, he makes her promise to give it up and become a normal teen girl.  Inspired by other ordinary citizens becoming superheroes, Dave re-assumes his Kick-Ass identity and joins the  Justice Forever  team of superheroes.  Meanwhile, Chris D Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) seeks to avenge his father s death by vowing to destroy Kick-Ass.\n\nGREG: And we re off  2010 s Kick-Ass was a story about how an ordinary guy had a positive effect on his community by becoming a superhero. It had a nice message: we re already super - costume not needed. This year s Kick-Ass 2 has a bit of a confused message. Mindy attempts to give up her Hit-Girl persona and become a typical high school teen. In fact, this thread of the story looks a lot like 2004 s Mean Girls. The popular girls adopt Mindy and just as quickly turn on her leaving Mindy to wonder who she really is. Meanwhile, Dave (as Kick-Ass) joins a burgeoning group of superhero do-gooders led by Captain Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey). The Capn gives the team their moral core and acts as a mentor. This team of masked misfits goes around town performing community service and busting up child pornography rings. Things are going pretty well until D Amico decides to create his own group of super-villains from the ranks of the city s worst criminals. That s when the tides turn and being a superhero becomes a risky undertaking.\n\nSCOTT: Earlier this summer, when reviewing Red 2,  I noted how difficult it is for a sequel to re-capture the charm of the original film.  Kick-Ass 2 is no exception.  The filmmakers know that we want to see the same characters recreate the former magic, but that s a tall order when Aaron Taylor-Johnson, cast as Dave, is obviously far too old to play a high school student but must play one anyway if we are to have a sequel. Kick-Ass 2 is a darker film than its predecessor, with even more stabbings, dismemberments, and decapitations than the original.  In addition, the emphasis has changed from Kick-Ass as the lead character to Mindy, who is caught in the moral dilemma of either honoring her commitment to Marcus or honoring her true self.  Mindy s inner struggle is central to the movie, and an argument could be made that while this is a buddy-hero story, she may actually be the main hero here.\n\nGREG: And therein lies the confused message. Mindy is struggling with her identity as a crime fighter versus teen girl. While Dave is   not struggling at all really. He goes through the hero s journey and in the end it s Mindy who has the revelation. There isn t much interaction between the two heroes in this story and it is like two movies in one. A bit of a retread of Kick-Ass (the first) and Mean Girls (with attitude). We don t really get a good reason for Mindy s conversion to the ordinary life. Marcus tells her to be a good girl and she says  Okay.  It s not a convincing plot point. Dave has an uncharacteristically savage attack on his father (played good-naturedly by Garrett M. Brown) when he tells him  You haven t amounted to anything. Nobody will notice when you re gone.  It is an abrupt rebuke when all interactions between the two had been chummy up to that point. These unexpected character eruptions seem trite and contrived.\n\nSCOTT: I agree, Greg.  This movie didn t quite know what it wanted to be.  Kick-Ass 2 essentially has the same confused identity that Mindy has.  But having said that, there is one aspect of the film that I truly liked.  The strongest and most competent superhero is a woman, and the strongest and most competent super-villain is also a woman.  Female heroes and villains are a rare breed in Hollywood, and so I found this aspect of Kick-Ass 2 to be refreshing. Also, I liked the way that Mindy becomes transformed as a character.  She grows to understand that she is in quite a bit of emotional pain, and we witness her becoming aware that as with any superhero, she needs to use that pain to do the right thing.  Kick-Ass himself has a far less dramatic transformation; he realizes that people need not don capes and masks to do good.  Ordinary citizens just need to make the right choice.  A good message, yes, but this is not as psychologically interesting as Mindy s self-insight.\n\nGREG: You make a good point, Scott. We haven t seen such a great female hero since Disney s Brave. I love the scene where Marcus is warning Mindy to be careful on her first date and she reminds him that she  knows how to kill a man with his own finger.  Awesome. And Olga Kurkulina (the Ukrainian female bodybuilder as Mother Russia) was a fierce villain, in contrast to her lame male counterparts. I m also impressed with your ability to extract those two messages from this film. It wasn t as easy for me. There didn t seem to be a central theme to this film and that left me confused and unsatisfied at the end. For a fun roller-coaster ride with a good bit of action and a decent female hero, I give 3 Reels. But for a confusing hero story I give only 2 Heroes to Kick-Ass 2. Movie: Hero:\n\nSCOTT: I m surprised you gave the film as many as 3 Reels, Greg.  If I could give a film two-and-a-half Reels, I would, but since I can t, I ll be a curmudgeon and award Kick-Ass 2 a meager 2 Reels out of 5.  The film is a bit of a contradiction in that it is both sweet and endearing yet brutally violent.  It is also clear in its message that we should all do the right thing, yet murky in the way it takes us to that message. As for the hero story, I was also disappointed by the film s muddiness.  Chlo  Grace Moretz is an utter delight in her role as Mindy, and we do witness her evolve nicely as a character.  But as you noted, Greg, we aren t really sure who the main hero of the story is, and the hero journeys themselves were a bit muddled.  For that reason, I ll be a miser and give the film only 2 Heroes out of 5. Movie: Hero:",

But after a three year gap, can Kick Ass achieve the same praise from audiences and gain the same cult status with a sequel? Can a sequel to satire and a controversial film be any good? \nAfter the events of the first film, Dave\u00b4s actions have inspired a new wave of costume freaks, so now with new allies, Kick Ass can patrol the streets without sacrificing his social life. Meanwhile Chris D'Amico is plotting his revenge against Kick Ass as he is also finding new allies. \nWhen you set yourself to make a sequel to a controversial box-office bomb that achieved a moderate cult following, you will most likely fail and that's the case with this sequel. \"Kick Ass 2\" counts with directing that tries too hard to imitate the first film, acting that\u00b4s a little hammy but passable, new characters that don't make any impression (why the hell is Jim Carrey here? His character is the most unnecessary), a script that feels so rushed as many elements of the film could have been streamlined, it has big tonal problems as it can go from cartoonish and pandering campy moments to brutal moments in the turn of a dime, the genre mixing (from your standard chick flick to \"The Warriors\" like style) is good on paper but in execution is a mess at they don't flow naturally, the attempts at comedy are embarrassingly bad,  the overall violence/\"shocking\" visuals don't surprise anymore as we have already seen it, and the editing is one of the worst I\u00b4ve ever seen as it's so poorly done that it never feels that the three storylines belong in the same movie and it creates major pacing issues. The only storyline I enjoyed was the Hit Girl chick flick stuff as it is somewhat amusing to witness this peculiar \"Superman 2\" depowering, while the MotherFucker\u00b4s storyline drags and tries too hard to be funny and the Kick Ass one is just a \"The Warriors\" wannabe that it fails to leave an impact. \n\"Kick Ass 2\" is one of the most embarrassing bad sequels I have seen in a while. It is desperate, rushed, nonsensical, poorly directed and overall laughable. Another example that proves a sequel to satire can't be done.",

Director Jeff Wadlow included all the violence and profanity from the first film but forgot to add any of the fun, resulting in a flat affair.\n\nThe key problem was how dull it all was, particularly involving the scenes where Mindy attempts to adapt to life in a new school- it all seemed too contrived. And I can't believe I'm saying this but the film misses Nicolas Cage. Jim Carrey has been cast to replace him in that big-name role but bizarrely he's barely in the film. There were just too many characters to keep track of and care about.\n\nWhile the first Kick Ass was a great antidote to superhero movies, this is nothing more than a terrible parody.",

This is one of the most entertaining movies of the summer, it's probably going to be on my top 10 list of best movies of 2014. It'll probably be on the top five. McLovin is great as the villains and Aaron Taylor Johnson is great as Kick Ass too! What made the first Kick ass so good was Chloe Grace Moretz as Hit Girl. In the first one she was an 11 year old badass! This time she's in high school but she's still badass. My only major complaint with Kick Ass 2 was that there wasn't much of Hit Girl in this movie. The movie focused so much on her high school life and her trying to fit in. I think a lot of people are going to have a problem with that. Other than that, there weren't many problems in this film, aside from the fight scenes with shaky cam.

The best parts are where Christopher Minz-Plaas is trying to be the World's Super Villain and has constant frustrations, especially with his layer.  These parts are what breaks up the kind of dull vigilante super hero aspects.  The second theme is Hit Girl struggling to stay out of the game while trying to become a typical high school girl.

As for Kick-Ass the other one night while he was hanging out with friends his dad was in his room to find out that his son was a vigilante but when Kick-Ass comes home to find out that his dad found out that cops were surrounding the house and getting home in time to see that his dad was getting put in the police car to be brought to jail Kick-Ass's Dad tells him to just give up the whole vigilante thing and let him take the blame for it while that happened Chris D' Amico now dubbing the nickname \"the MotherF***er\" he has made his plans of revenge on Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl and their hero army.

Characters' developments are good. I liked every single one of the characters, even the bad ones. 29%? Come one, it is not THAT bad. As I said the rhythm was good and I was engaged from the beginning to the end, never a dull moment. What do you expect from this kind of movie? It doesn't have to make sense or else the police wouldn't be so stupid and Kick-Ass would have been killed while feeding the homeless or long before that. Remember Kill Bill, when the Bride took her sword on the plane, how logical is that is real life?",

            "content": "The first Kick Ass was well, kick ass. Mainly because of Big Daddy and Hit Girl. And let's be honest, mostly because of Hit Girl. The rest of the heroes? Ehhh not so much. Let's face it, they are no match to Hit Girl and Kick-Ass was pretty much a geek with a mask. Imagine Urkel or Screetch taking to the streets to fight crime, and that's pretty much what it's like.\n\nChloe Grace Moretz and Aaron Taylor-Johnson reprise their roles ass Hit Girl and Kick Ass respectively. The only new hero I liked was Colonel Stars and Stripes, played by Jim Carrey. The fact that you really can't recognize him as Jim Carrey throughout the movie is a credit to his acting. Carrey is a better actor than most give him credit for.\n\nIn this installment, Kick Ass and Hit Girl are considering hanging up the mask and purple wig. This plays out rather dully and is a huge disappointment. The reason why? Because you have Hit Girl trying to fit in at school rather than stabbing and killing people. That's the bread and butter of Kick Ass, watching a fifteen year old take out people double her size and triple her age.\n\nAnd I found this movie leaning too hard on immature humor, i.e. poop jokes, morning wood, and anal beads (Ok, the anal beads were funny). They are gearing up for the younger audiences, even though the movie is rated R. I don't know if that means anything today, but I remembered when I was a kid, if it was rated R, I wasn't allowed watching it. Today, it's the exact opposite. Kids want to see it because it's rated R.\n\nDo the ticket salesmen at the movie care about the ratings? Do they let teenagers in to see Rated R movies? This is something I don't know. But if it's anything like one of my local cineplexes, teenagers themselves sell the tickets. So I doubt they care who's seeing the movie.\n\nSo when an R rated film tries to cater to young audiences, I find that offensive. You know what else is offensive? Not Hit Girl, that's for sure. And so lies the problem. If you thought the first movie was violent, this makes that movie look like a Comic-Con convention. And therein lies another problem. With so many ruthless murders, stabbings, and ridiculous lawn mowerings, who really wins this battle? It isn't the audience, that's for sure.\n\nSo to sum it all up, immature humor, aimed at a younger audience, check. Nerds and a pair of parents trying to fight crime. Check. Over the top killings? Check. Tons of Hit Girl action. Uncheck. There was honestly one scene that gave me the satisfaction of watching Hit Girl taking on her foes. The rest of the movie, quite frankly, didn't kick ass.",

The story feels a tad stale at some points and Hit-Girl's hubric journey a tad contrived.  There is a bit of a forced feminist message in this film.  While feminism is welcome in any form and place, a Kick-Ass movie doesn't seem to blend well with it.

Things aren't as humorous, as Hit-Girl is distinctly neutered for most of the film, and Kick-Ass' encounters do not have quite the distinctive bump that they did in the first.  The most potentially funny bloodbath happens at the hands of the villains and as such is not nearly as good as it could have been.  There are a litanny of support characters, but either they do not do enough to justify their screen time, or their motivations are a complete mystery.  Jim Carrey might just as well not be in this movie.  Also, didn't Dave live happily ever after more or less with Katie in the first movie?  Seems like having her drop him so early in this one is little more than a plot device to get him with Night Bitch later, and inconsistent with the character as given in the first.\nUltimately, it is decent if you like the high violence, but it misses that charm and wit that it had in spades previously.  And the villain's motives and whatnot are so poorly handled, making the Motherf**ker very one-dimensional, and as such all of his scenes are basically the same thing over and over again in different ways.",

Some have criticized the dark humor and violence as being unpleasantly off-tone with the first 'Kick-Ass', but I felt it was a logical escalation. The unpleasantness is certainly toned down a bit from the Mark Millar comics.

Initially I found it difficult to like any of the characters but they grew on me as the movie went on. As did the movie, growing increasingly funnier as it continued.

However, Johnson and mintz-plasse are back and the tension between the two brings up quite afew laughs, but the fun of the two being unexperienced in every way in the first film was much funner, in here they both become relatively experienced fighters which isnt as great as it sounds.

            "content": "\"Try to enjoy yourself. Otherwise, what's the point?\" claims Jim Carrey, playing the pensive yet strong-willed Colonel Stars and Stripes in this year's Kick-Ass sequel. The ingenuity of this quote is how well it suits Kick-Ass 2 as a moviegoer, because focusing on its cringe-worthy dialog and witless humor is likely to result in far too many scoffs and eye-rolls to enjoy the film.\n\nKick-Ass 2 leads with Dave, AKA Kick-Ass, having given up a life of vigilante justice for the normality of high school. It is not long before he learns that his heroic acts as the iconic Kick-Ass have inspired numerous citizens to take on superhero lifestyles, fighting for the sake of personal vengeance and retaliation, causing him to rejoin the vigilante cause. Mindy, famously known as Hit-Girl, has given up crime-fighting as well, and her storyline temporarily proceeds like a mediocre retelling of Mean Girls as she tries to lead a normal high school life. It comes as no surprise that Mindy's negative experiences inspire her heroic alter ego to emerge once again. Throughout these melodramatic plots, we revisit Chris, previously known as Red Mist (and whose new alter ego is hilarious but much too vulgar for me to type). Chris has taken on the role of a super-villain to avenge his father's death, caused by Kick-Ass in the first film. He recruits an army of powerful super-villains to battle the army of superheroes in hopes of murdering Kick-Ass once and for all.\n\nDespite its seemingly non-conventional plot, Kick-Ass 2 fails extensively in respect to its predecessor. Few can deny that the first Kick-Ass is shocking and wholly prolific R-rated entertainment due to its use of gratuitous violence and an 11-year-old girl spewing practically every vulgar word in the English language. In Kick-Ass 2, it is simply no longer effective. Fight scene cinematography mimics that of the first film, and when this is combined with cheesy plot points and unintelligent dialog, it creates a stale and uncreative mess. There is no denying that Kick-Ass 2 is strikingly entertaining and quick-witted at times, and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz shining in her reprisal as Hit-Girl makes it worth the watch. Unfortunately, the film follows the formula of its predecessor much too closely to leave a lasting impression.\n\nSide note: Stay after the credits for a fantastic spoiler.",

Dave Lizewski (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) hasn't fought crime as Kick-Ass for a while, but he asks Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) to keep him fit with training. But, Mindy's guardian Marcus Williams (Morris Chestnut) wants Mindy to lead a normal life, so Dave forms a gang with fellow costumed vigilantes Remember Tommy (Steven Mackintosh and Monica Dolan), Colonel Stars and Stripes (Jim Carrey), Night Bitch (Lindy Booth) and Battle Guy (Clark Duke), the latter is really Dave's geeky friend Marty. However, Chris D'Amico (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) swears revenge against Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl for killing his father, so he becomes supervilliant The Motherfucker. It's a sequel which manages to live up to expectations, and it manages to keep to the same sort of scale the first film had with a low budget and some very imaginative action sequences. It might have had negative PR with Jim Carrey washing his hands of the film, but if anything, it shows how destructive violence truly is.",

            "content": "Kick-Ass 2 is worth watching for the simple reason that the evolution of Chloe Grace Moretz is pretty fabulous to see.\n\nThe rest of the movie is decent enough to be entertaining, at least if you liked the first one.\n\nLuckily, the director didn't feel the need to recrate the first Kick-Ass. While the storyline naturally lends itself to a similar narrative (this time with a more natural antagonist in the form of Christopher Mintz-Plasse), we get a lot less training montages (thank God), fewer boring street fights (double-thank God), and replacing Nicolas Cage with Jim Carrey (less of a good thing).\n\nInstead of being a narrative driven by showcasing improving fighting skills, we have a narrative driven by the intersecting lives of the people in the movie. It's a definite shift of priorities, and in my opinion, it's a crucial one. It adds a better human element to this movie than the first one. And while the fighting here is decent, it's not different enough to carry the movie--shifting the narrative focus away from the boring aspects of superheroing actually creates a more engaging plot, allowing the fighting scenes to balance the narrative, rather than the other way around.\n\nSo while the first Kick-Ass is probably better, based purely on taking a premise and running with it, as a follow-up Kick-Ass 2 does what it should: doesn't try to recreate the magic by blazing new trails. And doing all of that without forgetting what the first movie was all about.",
