    "summary": "Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) faces a parent's worst nightmare when his 6-year-old daughter, Anna, and her friend go missing. The only lead is an old motorhome that had been parked on their street. The head of the investigation, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), arrests the driver (Paul Dano), but a lack of evidence forces Loki to release his only suspect. Dover, knowing that his daughter's life is at stake, decides that he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands.",

The main family is supposed to be Christian...crosses, music, prayers, prepping (ha!)...  Might the writers have found just one actual Christian to consult?  One would think the faith would have a point but it seems that the only point of it was to make the argument that faith is a load of bunk.  How else could it be that a faithful family suddenly descends into facing adversity with nonstop drug and alcohol abuse and violence?  The minor character of a priest is a blackout drunk who killed a man in his basement.  Of course!  Which leads me to wonder if it was intentional that an apparent bad guy \"with the IQ of a 10 year old\" is named Alex Jones??  smh...",

He then proceeds to abduct, imprison and brutally torture the prime suspect after a lack of evidence renders him incapable of conceiving any other alternatives.\n\nThe question of the film centers around the location of the missing children yet, despite his increasingly cruel variations of torture yielding no results over several days, the thought never crosses his mind to ask (or check) if they're at the suspect's home.\n\nEven after a culprit is apprehended, the father continues his exercise in madness until his victim, himself abducted as a child, has to tell him the obvious and directs him to search the first place he should have looked.\n\nDeranged (and drunk), the father goes to the home where his daughter is being held, donning his best handyman disguise. Intent on bungling the rescue of his child, he then places himself in a compromising position, allowing the true villain to (ironically?) imprison him, before the utterly inept authorities arrive to finish what he couldn't.",

Denis Villeneuve went on to Sicario and other excellent films; revisiting this now, I hoped to see what I'd missed the first time, hoping it cohered more than I remembered and that I could be more in line with the prevailing good opinion of the film. \n\nMuch of those things to admire remain, especially Roger Deakins's predictably brilliant cinematography. Shot by a lesser talent, it's probable that the film's atmosphere would be considerably less brooding and uncomfortable. My problem with the central criminal's motivation remains - without descending to spoilers, such situations send at least as many in the opposite direction as they do in the general direction that the villain has gone. \n\nHugh Jackman's performance doesn't work (it's far from subtle); Gyllenhaal is better, but his tics seem a little corny. There's little to counteract the problem of Sicario, that the central female character is underwritten; here the wives are adjuncts and those who wait for their men to do what men will do.  None of this makes the film less atmospheric or detracts from the artistry; it's just that for me it's not quite the film it wants to be or that Sicario and his other later films would turn out to be.",

The main negative point in my opinion is the character of Jake Gyllenhaal, who is the clumsiest detective in Hollywood. He takes time to do everything in the investigation, misses clues, doesn't scan and explore the places properly and gets lost in the search all the time. I liked the way Hugh Jackman gave himself to the role, his performance is good here, but ends up being hampered by a weak script, which throws up several loose ends during 2h30 of the film and takes the one that fits best at the end, throwing it away the others.",

As did having a cast of talented actors such as Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo.\n\n'Prisoners' almost lives up to the acclaimed hype with most of the film being absolutely exceptional, but doesn't quite make it. Its only major stumbling block is that it spirals out of control towards the end, the tension does slip, there are big lapses in credibility and characters' actions and morality issues become implausible and much less believable. Having been so impressed with the rest of the film, this was a real pity. Maybe it is a little overlong too.\n\nOn the other hand, Roger Deakins shows again why he is one of the best contemporary cinematographers in the business with cinematography that's stunning and darkly gritty, also bringing out the visceral horror. The production values in general are impeccably audacious and deeply haunting and the editing is suitably stylish.\n\nJohannsson's music score is suitably ominous and pulse-pulsating, one can actually feel their heart beat with tension and anticipation.\n\nVilleneuve's directing has a beautiful darkness but also a hard edge that is perfect for the story.\n\nWhile the script is not quite as taut as that for 'Sicario', it does provoke thought and its unsettled nature hits hard. The story is not perfect, but a vast majority of it is nail-biting in tension, frightening in its suspense and very much edge of your seat. It is very violent and is not for the faint hearted because it is so vivid and the turn of events are unpredictable and devastating. It's deliberate in pacing but never dull, despite slacking towards the end.\n\nCharacters are interesting, especially Jackman's increasingly unpredictable Keller Dover. You don't condone what he's done and his actions are extreme and one can sort of understand why he resorts to such drastic measures.\n\nJackman is at his most hard-hitting, a shocking atypical performance that is among his best. Gyllenhaal is firm and understated, Dano is at his most unnerving and at times affecting and Terrence Howard gives one of the best performances he's ever given (showing that with the right material, like here, that he can be good).\n\nDavis and Leo, as to be expected, are outstanding, as is a poignant Maria Bello.\n\nIn summary, 'Prisoners' may be long in length yet high in suspense and tension. It had all the makings of an exceptional film, and actually was for most of its running time, but that the ending disappoints as much it does it goes down to being a very good one. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

An incredibly well executed movie that ties you almost instantly to your chair.\n\nDenis Villeneuve is hands down one of the best directors of this generation and his work in Prisoners is fantastic, you can really see how passionate he is about his job. Everything, and I really mean everything is well tought and well put together. Roger Deakins again nails with the cinematography. There is literally not a single frame i would change.\n\nThe acting is from another world. Hugh Jackman is top notch, the range of this man in this movie is incredible and comes to show how talented he really is. I feel like I have nothing to say about Gyllenhaal because he is fucking incredible in every movie he does, but he was specially good in here. Viola Davis and Maria Bello were great and portrayed the role of desperate and hopeless mothers so well. The biggest surprise in this movie was Paul Dano. The man can act!\n\nPrisoners is a fascinating crime story. It has a lot a foreshadowing and deep symbolism. Every line and every shot are important to the story and that's what makes this film so great. It's very unpredictable, which is perfect in a crime/thriller movie. It is a masterpiece and it's Villeneuve's work at his finest. One of the best movies of the 10s and my second favorite from Denis, only after Blade Runner 2049.",

Hugh Jackman's rage shines through making him terrifying to watch, instantly grabbing your attention.\n\nPrisoners (2013) is a tense film from start to finish thanks to Denis Villeneuve's directorial style of showing and telling the story, not to mention fierce performances from all actors and actresses involved.

The cinematography is amazing, the shots in this movie can make you feel the entire scene and absorb everything you are seeing without any cuts ruining it, and it can also make you feel claustrophobic at times. Some scenes in this movie had me on the edge of my seat and my heart pounding because of how gripping a certain scene was, and I only watched this movie on my small iPhone 7 screen. This isn't a horror movie, but sometimes I would squint or get scared because a scene would be that heavy. This movie is a mystery, and is not predictable at all, it deals with family and trauma, and explores how far a man would go to save a  family member. This movie also has tons of symbolism, whether it's purposeful or not. And the ending\u2026 oh my god the ending\u2026 It's hard to describe in words what emotions you go through in the ending, but at the same time I don't want to spoil it, so I'll just say that the ending was cool.

His first three, August 32nd on Earth, Maelstr\u00f6m, and Polytechnique, weren't very good for me, and only until his 4th, Incendies, which I pretty recently watched, did Villeneuve got the right budget to make great movies. \n\nI watched Prisoners a while ago, and I remembered not really digging it. However, after this rewatch, I totally loved this movie. First of all, Hugh Jackman's intense performance outshined everyone else. The way his character lost his humanity while trying to find the answer was both heartbreaking and terrifying. Jake Gyllenhaal was also great with his change in demeanor as a cop. The way he smiled at first and then turned violent got on my nerve a little bit. \n\nThe story itself was intense, slow, yet intriguing. For 2 hours and 30 minutes, I did not feel bored, and only got more gripped into the story as the movie progressed. It did not feel long. The plot was a harsh look at the way people lost their faith or tried to cling to their faith without losing themselves to hatred. \n\nProbably the best aspect that elevated the mystery was the maze symbol that became more apparent toward the end. Not only was it integral to the plot, but the mazes without a way out also served as prisons that the characters got stuck in. Some got imprisoned in captivity, childhood trauma, revenge, finding answers, and hatred of God.\n\nOverall, an amazing and gripping thriller that I wanted more of. 9/10",

Probably my favorite performance of his to date.  I still don't know if I loved Gyllenhaal's performance, but overall, he fit the bill.  This had a real feeling of genuine crime thriller for me and was brilliantly directed.  The payoff was worth the wait and the final act's twist was unexpected.  I would've likely given this 4.5/5 stars if it wasn't so long.  I felt they could've shorted to 90-100 minutes though.  With it being over two hours, it resulted in some needless dialogue at times.

His acting is complimented greatly by Jake Gyllenhaal, whose performance as Detective Loki is impeccable. The mannerisms of Detective Loki (which Jake Gyllenhaal thought of himself) bring so much characterization to the role. However, as amazing as the performances are, this does not outshine the equally impressive directing, screenplay and cinematography. A classic. 10/10.",

Shot incredibly by the legend Roger Deakins and with superb performances from Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terrence Howard, and Melissa Leo, Prisoners is an excellent thriller which follows both the victim's and police's storylines. Its quite an intense and raw film, and really plays up the tension and intensity of the story. Its an incredible film, which helped launch the career of Villeneuve and catapult him to the upper echelons of directing talent. Whats great about Prisoners is that it doesn't shy away from the hardships that a kidnapped child's parents' would go through. Jackman plays the role of a distraught father on a mission to find his child extremely well. This is by far his best performance of his career. His rage is real and you can feel he put a lot of energy into this character. Gyllenhaal as the cop gives a really underrated performance in this film, and Leo gives a really good and creepy performance. But by far the best aspect of this film is Deakins's cinematography. How he captures the cold and dark nature of the story really shows the legend's mindset in terms of filming sequences. This film is probably my fave Villeneuve film, and one that deserves more attention than his other work in my opinion.",

A great film that has great acting performances, cinematography, directing, screenplay, and everything. \n\nPrisoners really surprised me with everything. Didn't expect the film to go to where it's going. Its story is so great and I believe that's thanks to the build-up that took 2 hours. Although it's a long time. But, in the end, it will all make sense and the pieces are all put together perfectly. Every film is famous for a specific scene but it's hard to find one in this film because there are so many so it's hard to pick. I'll be honest, at the first, I didn't like that the film was taking too much time to tell the story and it was giving us one piece after the other but at the end, we were able to put all of them together and it gave us a masterpiece.\n\nI believe that this is Jake Gyllenhaal's second-best performance (Nightcrawler being the first). He was able to present Detective Loki in such a unique way that only Jake himself is able to play. For those who don't know, Detective Loki's tattoos, rings, and rapid blinking were all Jake Gyllenhaal's ideas. I believe that the rings and the tattoos have meanings behind them which makes Detective Loki an interesting character that we all want to know more about. Now for Hughe Jackman,  I believe that this is his best performance even better than Wolverine. In many scenes, you could feel his pain as a father who lost his daughter especially in those scenes where he was screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs. You can feel the pain in his voice. Overall, the acting in this film is ON POINT.\n\nDenis Villeneuve's way of directing this film is very unique. He was able to give us drama, Thriller, Crime, and many more using his directing and the little small details that you might think don't matter but they all will at the end. Roger Deakins with his great cinematography/camera movements were beautiful, the film really has many shots that are beautiful. Also, the colors and the editing really helped to give the audience that thriller/crime vibe. \n\nOverall, this film has everything. Acting, cinematography, editing, directing, and even the music/soundtrack may be the most part that many didn't notice. But, in some scenes, you could hear the beautiful soundtrack of J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson playing in the background and giving you that suspense/thriller feel. Great film that the more you get deep into it and notice the little details, the more you like it. \n\nMy rating is 9/10",

Gyllenhaal is reliably superb, while Jackman does his best despite delivering what some might see as an overly shouty, belligerent performance and scattershot lines making it difficult for the audience to sympathize with him. Viola Davis offers up a surprisingly complex supporting role. Paul Dano also steals the show in the few scenes that he has. The final payoff didn't quite warrant the two-ish hours before it of slow, painful buildup.\n\nThe ambition of the film makes it worth the watch, which perhaps isn't the greatest argument. The themes of internal and external prisons, along with religion are intriguing enough to allow for thoughtful reflection despite dissatisfaction with a few plot points. The priest was an example of missed potential, while the main red herring of the mystery convoluted the plot and seemed an artificial implant rather than a worthwhile diversion. \n\nI simply enjoy that Prisoners builds multiple characters well in order to explore the implications and effects of a kidnapping upon those close to the victims. The effort is not perfect or unblemished, but this indirectly adds to the humanity surrounding the film. The visual style and good suspense also bump this one up to a positive rating.",

After a while you start noticing some things that seem very... weird or out of character. On this step it only gets worse. Youll notice more and more things. These arent some plotholes. The whole movie builds on coincidences and stupidity of the characters. \n\nthe acting of jake and hugh are great. Probably the only thing that was great.\n\nSpoiler:\n\nFirst of all. Why has the detective no partner? A Partner would like... make total sense. Okay. Ill start right after the police got the kid but he isnt answering to anybody. Except to the father when he got released. Because...? yup, theres no excuse at all in the end. It doesnt make sense. He told him that something that makes him the prime suspect in the case. Spoiler: No one cared about him. Literally. The police not believing anything is only the cherry on the cake. Okay. Noted. Its even noted that the police is looking everywhere. Except in the house of the kidnapper. Ok. Given, theres no trace at all - even with dogs - that the children were ever in this house. MAYBE the tracks of the abandoned car only moving 3 meters would make anyone with half a brain thinking \"why would anyone move this car recently? maybe Ill look under it.\". Nope. No one will notice these tracks. Not even with a full team in the end thats currently digging the whole garden to find dinosaurs. They cant find anything. Ok. No Tracks. Noted.\n\nTheres a new suspect, he flew from the police after he touched a teddy. Now theres only one suspect. No one cares about the first suspect, they don't even watching him. Because...? yeah. He wasnt  it, because he didnt admit it. Check. Via pure luck a witness saw the new suspect and could give the police the tag of his car. \n\nThey find him at home. Better call the detective and drive away as far as we can.\n\nThe detective arrived at the house of the suspect. Everyone currently thinks: This is it. There are the kids. SWAT should arrive soon but instead:\n\nNOT EVEN ONE POLICE CAR WAS AT THIS HOUSE. The detective entered ALONE the house of the suspect. A Partner would come in handy, but that would make the movie less suspensful. Ok. Given.\n\nMeanwhile the first kidnapper got kidnapped by the father. Somehow the kidnapper  manages to withstand 24/7 tortue and breaks only after 7 Days and tells him they were in the maze. How would this kid doesnt tell anything in the first couple of days? Besides the cheap movie trick \"better let the kid misstreat an animal before he got kidnapped, so the viewer agrees with this whole torture thing.\" \n\nOk. Even given that. The detective now follows the father, because maybe he has anything to do with the kidnappers missing.  Where would you hide if you followed someone in a car. The best place would be.... in the middle of a crossing in traffic. Smartest thing to do: Just wait. After a while a truck arrives and honks loudly. The father noticed him (no shit) and didnt lead him into his secret house. \n \nSomehow now the detective thinks: The only way to find his hideout is reading the newspaper of the last years that contained the name of the father. Obviously he finds the adress and drives to this house. Again: Alone. \nSo he breaks into the hideout. Knocking? Why? This doesnt make any sense. He only knocks on houses when hes locking for a suspect involved kidnapping children. This is something serious: A random person may or may not have been kidnapped. \n\nSo hes in the house and finds the father sleeping on the ground. he wakes him up and aks what up. \"yeah, im sleeping way better in this creepy house on a cold floor than at home\". Detective \"yeah, cool, can you show me around?\". Father. \"well, of course, I have only kidnapped and tortured someone upstairs. I could of course ask for a search permit or why you are even in my house - but the better thing to do is showing you everything\"\n\nYadayada - The cop is just one room away from the kidnapper. His phone rings and: \n\nOne children could escape after 7 days. How? Uhm. She ran away.\n\nGood, we should stop looking at this house and drive fast with separate cars to the hospital. Its a good thing that I have a police car with blue light and you got a car. \n\nProbably the reason because the father arrived way earlier than the detective. \n So, father in the room and asks the child anything about clues etc. \nThe kid now tells the father that she have seen him. Perfect clue. The father clicks and thinks:\"well, I was at the mothers house - OF COURSE\". So he rushes to the exit. Police is suspicious, \"block the exits!\" \"lock the hospital down, all units check every exit!\"\n\nSo the father escapes without a scene and drives to the house of the lady. yeah, no one is following him, he escaped the hospital so we cant follow him. \n\nFather arrives at the house and asks the nice lady if he can come in to fix anything in the house. The lady naturally agrees, this wouldnt be weird at all. \nThe father proceeds to put all his tools on the kitchen counter and doesnt watch the lady at all. Why would he? So he said \"I dont want to hit you\" and turns around at looks into the smallest .22 caliber gun in the universe. Picture this: He stands 2 meters to the lady. Hugh fucking Jackman build like a bear against a small women with a very tiny revolver. He could easily move or try something - because lets be real: This thing wont stop him.  But Nope. He does everything what she demands, even including drinking a knockout cocktail. So they go outside, the lady now directly behind him pointing the gun to.. something, not the father thou. So naturally he doesnt do anything (the same guy that tortured someone else with pure violence for 7 days straight) and does again everything she says. Only after he \n looks into a black hole said \"you have to shoot me if you want me to jump in there\". Well. This was maybe a better idea before she was standing 5 meters apart from you and just shot him in the leg. (neighbors dont care/exist).\n\nSo he jumps into the hole. \nMeanwhile the best detective on this planet, after they have found the kidnapped kidnapper, had the job to tell the nice lady that his child was found. Nope, not via phone. He has to come in person. He knocks, no one answers - the lady currently kills the child. So what does a good detective when he should bring a good answer and no one is answering the door. Yes, obviously he opens the door and searches for the lady - in the end he shot her and she shot him in the head. Yeah, of course \"tis but a scratch\" and he can bring the child safely to the hospital.\n\nSo. The Children are safe. Not because the father. Not because the great detective work. It was just random. The first child could escape via luck and the second child survived because the detective knocked on this evening on the door, which was just a stupid coincidence. \n\nThe story of the second suspect isnt really tellworthy, because this was the laziest red hering I have ever seen. He got arrested and catches the gun of the great detective in the interrogance room. Naturally the detective and the police all have their weapons still and are looking baffled that he kills himself in slowmo. Nope, they dont try to stop him.\n\nSo. This is one of the best movies out there and im here and wondering: WHY IS NO ONE NOTICING ANY OF THIS?\n\nEnjoy the movie.",

The plot has a lot of great twists and turns, as well as it leaves you with a feeling that everything can happen in this movie. It is, of course, not on a \"Gone Girl\" level, but it is still thrilling enough to make you live through, what the characters live through and the ending is something, that leaves you thinking the most(it actually made me). \nThis movie is very good, awesome even, I would say. I would recommend it if you love Hugh Jackman or Jake Gyllenhaal and if you like thrillers, that have a great structure and a plot, like a puzzle, which the viewer solves the entire film. 8/10, without any doubt a thriller that not many remember, but many should watch",

The movie confuses tension with disturbing scenes, so I wasn't on the edge of my seat I was just grossed out and disturbed. The biggest problem is the runtime. The movie isn't good enough to justify a 154 minute runtime. Also not enough happens in the movie to make me feel like the movie flies by. I can count eight or nine scenes that could've been cut from the movie. There are also some scenes that feel like they don't even belong in the movie, something happens and there is no payoff. I will say that the big reveal at the end is really good and shocking, but the ending also makes you ask questions and with a 2 and a half hour runtime all questions should be answered. I wouldn't recommend it to pass time because it is so long and I wouldn't recommend it to watch for a very intense movie. It deserves a 57%.",

This movie just has an absolutely stacked cast and everyone just does an amazing job. Hugs's performance rivals Logan for his best performance, they both should have got nominated for an Oscar. This is an emotional movie and it almost brought me to tears at a few points. I love the way they reveal things it some of the small things to the big things. I feel for the characters for Hugh Jackman for him wanting to protect his family and Jake Gyllenhaal him wanting to finish the case.\n\nLike I said before the acting and talent on screen is just outstanding and it has some of the best acting put to screen and some of my favorite performances. The tension in some scenes especially, in the end, it just amazing and it kept me on the edge of my seat. The script and the dialogue are just amazing in each scene it feels so grounded. The score in some scenes just feels so good and it elevates some moments in scenes and the score feels like the movie. The cinematography is amazing from Roger Deakins and he is my favorite cinematographer working now from 1917 to 2049 Blade Runner. The color correction in the snow and at some houses look amazing. Overall I absolutely love this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.\n\ud83d\udcaf%",

I can't believe it (1) isn't more popular and (2) that it only has an (80) RT critics' score. Gyllenhaal as the live-and-die-by-his-job detective \u2014 he literally doesn't have an interaction that doesn't have to do with the case \u2014 is tortured from falling short lead after lead. We are told that Detective Loki has never let a case go cold. What is cold, however, is the ice-water in his veins, as he didn't even flinch finding a moldering body in a priest's dank basement/secret compartment. I've always said that Joaquin Phoenix is the most underrated actor in Hollywood (a statement I'll need to amend now that he's won an Oscar for Best Actor), but in terms of thrillers, Gyllenhaal is right up there with performances in Zodiac (a film I love but have not watched since starting this blog), and Nightcrawler, where I know he gives a fantastic performance and is on my list. Gyllenhaal's counterpart is Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, the grieving father of his missing child. While Jackman's accent might slip here and there, his character teeters from sympathetic to terrifying from one scene to the next. I must say, his wood shower torture device was showcased both his will to find his daughter and his craftsmanship as a carpenter. The misdirections are effective at keeping the viewer engaged and, of course, there is a plausible twist that was satisfying. I was afraid maybe the ending was going to ruin the movie, but really loved how they brought a prop from the beginning full-circle.",

Jackman is really in top form and carries the movie. One of his best performances I think . Jake Gyllenhaal fills in nicely but it\u2019s Jackman\u2019s movie. Although the premise was interesting with its use of symbolism and commentary on Religion. For me it still sorta fell short right about at the third act . Probably maybe not the pay off I\u2019d expected . However still a well crafted slow burn of a thriller. ",

In this brooding thriller, Denis Villeneuve explores the ways in which individuals react and respond to trauma. The story revolves around two contrasting individuals and their separate attempts to locate two missing girls. Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is stoic and enigmatic. His composure is calm and his demeanor is reticent. Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, is a devout and caring father, whose faith is challenged as he battles with decadence to locate the missing girls, one of which is his own. The small details in this film bring it to masterpiece status. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is crisp and bleak. The score by the late J\u00c3\u00b3hann J\u00c3\u00b3hannsson is eerie and haunting.

Villeneuve uses clever visual clues and stunning cinematography from Roger Deakins to key in the audience to hidden meanings and revealing moments in this crime mystery.\n\nThe detective narrative captured by Jake Gyllenhaal's brilliant understated role is impressive unto itself. Villeneuve imagines an investigation from start to finish with realistic developments and decision making process. In the process, Villeneuve and writer Aaron Guzikowski demonstrate how the police construct a character study of a perpetrator and find missing children. Prisoners shows detectives at their hardest working and the mental toll they undergo to save lives. Prisoners simultaneously reveals flaws in the process of capturing suspects and searching for evidence.\n\nSimilarly, Prisoners debates the moral necessity for torture and the ethics of interrogation with Hugh Jackman's character. As much as Prisoners sympathizes with the victims of kidnapping in the children themselves as well as the parents and siblings in a larger community. Prisoners also strives to prove the value of trusting police work instead of going rogue and conducting private torture and imprisonment. You could argue that Jackman's character's efforts lead to nothing but trouble and only hinder the detective's investigation. Jackman does uncover several key clues, but in the end, he only endangers himself regardless of finding the killer. It's a tough visual to appreciate as Prisoners asks the audience what is right, despite what we would like to think that we would do if put in the same situation.\n\nAll in all, Prisoner's is a masterful thriller that is so suspenseful in the capable hands of director Denis Villeneuve. The two leading actors, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, keep you engaged with each scene leading to more suspense.\n\nThe supporting roles from the unsettling Paul Dano, the frightening Melissa Leo, the tragically hurt Maria Bello and Viola Davis, and the upset and uncertain Terrence Howard are all fantastic. Their respective roles all culminate in a moving cast of impressive performances. They each build up the tragedy of Prisoner's dark narrative. \n\nWhile Prisoners can be imposing by its bleak nature, I think it is a captivating film in its own right. Perhaps director Denis Villeneuve's best film even. Prisoners is a stomach churning meld of The Lovely Bones, The Boston Strangler, and Zodiac. Part police procedural, part sociopath character study, part victim viewpoint, and all entertaining, if upsetting. Through all the pain, each person is left a prisoner of their own situation.",

Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a prisoner of his past. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a prisoner of his need to protect his family at all costs. And so on, and so forth.\n\nThe performances in this movie are absolutely outstanding. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are the obvious ones, but I thought that Paul Dano and David Dastmalchian did excellent jobs portraying creepy, disturbing characters.\n\nI really liked the cinematography. It's beautiful and dark and claustrophobic. The musical score is also orchestrated incredibly well, with tense atmospheric tracks to amplify the stress when needed.\n\nThe plot of Prisoners is intricate, but not overwrought or convoluted. It's easy enough to follow if you're paying attention, and allows the viewer to make connections on their own. It's fascinating and stressful to watch the characters discover the pieces and fit them together. Everything is important.\n\nMost importantly, this film asks very difficult questions. If you were in the shoes of Keller Dover or Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), what would you do? Would you follow the path of Keller, or the path of Franklin? Would either choice be right or wrong? Would it destroy your faith, the way that the perpetrator intended?\n\nOverall, Prisoners is a fantastic morally grey movie that forces the viewer to think about what they're being shown.",

The tense moments, the emotional beats, and getting the most out of his actors. Hugh Jackman (Keller Dover) gives one of his more underrated performances ever. We know him as Wolverine, but here, he played the part of a desperate man at the end of his line so well. It shouldn't be overlooked. Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki) was also great, as was Viola Davis (Nancy Birch). She didn't get a lot of screen time, but she made the most of it. Her plea to Paul Dano's (Alex Jones) character is one of the best scenes. Dano is great, as is the short run by Melissa Leo (Holly Jones), who is nearly unrecognizable. Again, it comes back to Villeneuve. He sets the perfect dark tone and the mood of the film is perfect. It takes you on a psychological whirlwind as the mystery unfolds and it's quite the journey.\n\nWeaknesses: There aren't many. As usual, I couldn't really get into Terrence Howard's (Franklin Birch) performance. Something about him in a lot of movies leaves something to be desired and I felt the same way here. The twist involving Leo's character isn't that hard to predict, taking ab it away from the moment itself. Also, the movie is very long and probably could use some trimming of the fat. Cut down to two hours, it would have probably flowed better.\n\nOverall: A gritty mystery film that is masterfully handled. Led by a great director and stunning performances from its leads, especially Jackman and Gyllenhaal, it ranks among the best films of the past five years.",

The story is interesting and well paced, even for a 2h30 long film. But what really takes the show is the duo of actors, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal both deserve an Academy award, it's some of the best and most convincing acting I've ever seen. Overall, it's a grim movie, bot for everyone's taste, but still a great piece of cinema. Recommended !!",

Prisoners is about a pair of girls who are abducted which leads to an investigation and search effort by the father of one girl played superbly by Hugh Jackman. This is a tough but rewarding film to sit through and the pacing is good- you will be transfixed throughout. The acting is superb and everyone from Terence Howard and Jake Gyllenhaal to Paul Dano and Melissa Holly shine, but the star act is Jackman who should have received more accolades for his turn as the distraught father in this movie. Cinematography is stunning as is the direction.",

As I begin to experience the film, it's like I'm not even watching them act, because it was so natural...\n.\nI won't spoil the main plot of the movie, just please watch it if you have enough free time...This film is worth your time. See this movie with the right mindset, don't expect some non-stop action in this movie because it will disappoint you. This is the movie where it will soak you with so much drama and how you can relate to it as a human being.\n.\nFor That Ladies and Gentlemen! This Film In My Opinion, Is The Best Movie I've Seen That Is Nearly As Great As \"The Shawshank Redemption\"...Shawshank is like a strand of hair on top of it :D Because \"The Shawshank Redemption\" was the first drama movie that I've seen when I was 14 years old that I really loved...That was rare for me at that time, because I was young and dumb, and that movie experience somewhat matured me when I view films like this...\n.\nAnd of course...You already know what I'm going to rate this film...A PERFECT 10 OUT OF 10!",

I haven't seen Taken or its sequels, so I'm not sure how this fits into the apparent genre - but parent Hugh Jackman decides to take the investigation into his own hands and his fury means that he isn't subtle.  I don't think we are meant to identify with Jackman, because everything he does seems to alienate the viewer (and threaten his relationships with everyone else, including his wife, Maria Bello, and the other couple, Viola Davis and Terrence Howard).  As the hunt for the abductor continues, the clues pile up, suspects are tracked down, creepiness abounds (and tends to dominate over the sadness and disgust that would otherwise be the main feeling, since we are dealing with child abduction and possible paedophilia here).  You might catch a bit of a Silence of the Lambs vibe, I suppose.  Gyllenhaal is dogged in his pursuit of all leads, although the police action is pretty genre-consistent at best. In the end, things do get tied up with a bow, but I've read that an even darker ending was proposed - that probably would have made for a better film.",

And we also meet Franklin and Nancy Birth (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their young daughter Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons).  After their dinner, the families discover that the two young girls are missing. Ralph remembers that the girls had earlier been interested in playing on an RV parked near their home, and soon the police, led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) focus their search on the RV and its owners.\n\nGREG: Loki finds the RV and its driver is Alex (Paul Dano) who is a full grown adult but has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old. He is taken into custody but offers no clue as to the whereabouts of the girls. Also, there is no evidence of the girls in the RV. The police let him go. But Keller Dover is not convinced that Alex is ignorant of the girls  location and abducts the man. Together with his friend Franklin he hides the man in an abandoned home and beats him mercilessly trying to get some clue about where to find his daughter.\n\nSCOTT: I ll cut right to the chase. Prisoners is one of the best movies of the year. The film grabbed my attention from the opening minute and held it in earnest for 2 and a half hours. Prisoners is the most compelling movie I ve seen since The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo which came out in 2011. What explains the excellence of Prisoners?  For one thing, it s riveting. We have a powerful storyline combined with the emotional anguish associated with innocent children gone missing. We witness the parallel hero journeys of two strong characters in Keller and Loki, each driven by the same goal of finding the missing girls alive yet they find themselves locking horns repeatedly. There are strong performances from the entire cast and some outstanding direction, too.\n\nGREG: I have to agree. I was leary of a 150-minute running time, but every minute is put to good use. Detective Loki is not just dedicated, but obsessed with finding the girls. He hasn t lost a case yet and he doesn t expect to lose this one.  Despite Gyllenhaal s cool exterior, his Loki is focused and intense. There is also a time limit. Keller keeps reminding Loki that children that aren t found after 7 days are rarely found alive, if they are found at all. And the days tick by with both men approaching the search in their own fashion. Loki is methodical. We get the sense that his every waking moment is focused on solving this case. We are drawn into Loki s world and his intensity is palpable.\n\nSCOTT: Whereas Loki is caught between his incompetent boss and Keller s defiance, Keller is torn between his Christian faith and his desire to do whatever it takes to get Alex to talk.  This makes for a terrific hero story, as Keller s intensity and devotion to his daughter s safety compromise his better judgment.  Or so it seems.  Keller cannot find it in himself to live up to his own strong Christian belief in forgiveness, and yet in an interesting twist, Keller s inability to forgive Alex leads him toward discovering the truth. One of many things I liked about Prisoners is the way it invites us to ponder interesting issues like forgiveness.  Another theme is the idea of  readiness  for life s obstacles. Keller believes he is physically and emotionally ready for any catastrophe, and he even drills this principle to his children, but it s painfully clear that Keller isn t ready at all for what unfolds in this movie. We learn that no one can be ready for every possible setback that life throws at us.\n\nGREG: The title of the movie is misleading. We re attracted to the movie because we think that the story is about two little girls who are prisoners. But in fact, the prisoners in this film are Loki and Keller. They re both bound to their ideals and constrained by their beliefs. Loki believes that if he follows the clues and plays within the rules then he will solve the case. And he is trapped in that belief system. When things don t work the way he thinks they should, he begins to make mistakes. But working outside the box means the system doesn t work - and he needs it to work. Keller believes that protecting his family is his sole responsibility. And it s clear that he s not able to protect his family from every eventuality. If he cannot find his daughter he will have to live with the fact that he has failed. And this is not something he can live with. This forces him to work outside the system and find his daughter by any means necessary.\n\nSCOTT: Well said, Greg. Prisoners is one of the year s best films and contains more memorable scenes than the previous dozen movies combined which we ve reviewed. This film is a great reminder of why I love movies and how a good story can leave its audience thinking and feeling in meaningful ways. I give Prisoners 5 Reels out of 5. The parallel hero stories here were also inspired and moving. Keller and Loki are most certainly not your Hollywood-stereotypical father and cop characters, nor were their journeys predictable. They were two highly memorable characters who travel the hero arc in surprising and powerful ways. There is absolutely no chance at all that their searing experiences could fail to transform them.  I give them 5 Heroes out of 5. Movie:   Hero: \n\nGREG: I agree, this is one of the best films of the year so far. I have to say that I didn t find it as rewarding as you did. I was held captive by the plot and the performances. But I wasn t satisfied that either man impacted the other. At the end of the day they were both vindicated in their own way of thinking. I don t think Detective Loki was much changed at the end of the film compared to the beginning. In fact almost nobody was much different at the end of the film. Keller was tortured by the fact that he couldn t keep his family safe from every evil thing and he became something that was far from heroic. I award Prisoners 4 Reels out of 5 for an entrancing psychological thriller and 4 out of 5 Heroes for compelling characters that kept me watching. To get to a higher rating I would want to see some interaction between Keller and Loki that would catalyze them to change in some more compelling way. Movie:  Hero:",

Denis Villeneuve is a visionary director who knows how to tell a story. The film was very emotionally tense. It's an Emotional Roller Coaster of a film.

In a grueling and long, seemingly endless mystery, we'll experience the pain of losing a child and just how far one will go to put things back to normal.\n\n\"Prisoners\" is an emotional and tragic story about a pair of families who lose their young daughters. Not only is this just hard to watch at times, but it's also really painful. This film is emotional and it just drains you. You're watching this family experience this loss and there's really no words to describe it. I don't think anyone would know what to do when it comes to losing their child and I can't imagine experiencing that. Seeing it play out is enough for me.\n\nThis film is a really good, intriguing mystery film. It's a mix between like a crime and a drama film because you're going along this journey with the detective to figure out who committed the crime, but you're also following the family's story. This movie keeps you guessing and wondering and it never really has a clear cut answer. It's very dark and the entire mystery somehow constantly added more and more layers to the story. It was a very fun (I use that term loosely) story to try and analyze and solve.\n\nHugh Jackman has an amazing and gut wrenching performance here. You see just how far a Father will go to find his daughter and the surplus amount of pain that comes with that. He does things and experiences things that most other men won't, all because this is such a painful tragedy. Jake Gyllenhaal, who's still my favorite actor today, also gives a great performance. He plays the serious and firm detective with a twitch, and he also does a great job as one of the primary leads. Paul Dano also gives one of his eeriest performances to date, playing a low IQ, potential suspect boy. All the performances were fantastic in this film and they really brought out that emotional gravity of the situation.\n\nThe screenplay overall was amazing. I loved the dialogue and the chain of events. This is a long, drawn out film that might not necessarily be for everyone, but it's still a fantastically structured script.\n\nIn the end, \"Prisoners\" is one of the best films of 2013, being one of the darkest and most real dramas out there.",

Hugh Jackman, Terrance Howard, and Jake Gyllenhaal are in this as well as Voila Davis and other talented actors and actresses. First off let's talk about Jackman, the main character. OH MY GOD HES FUCKING AMAZING, seriously, I love x-men, but this might be his best performance and movie I've ever seen. Terrance Howard and Viola Davis, the other couple in the film with the missing daughter are both great here too. I was really blown away by Jake Gyllenhaal, playing the head detective to solve this case about the girls. Paul Dano plays the role he plays in almost every film, but with a little something extra, which made his character even more compelling. I could talk for hours about the acting, but all I can say now is that every character was extremely compelling and never bored me when I was watching. The camerawork and lighting are all impeccable as well, long drawn out shots are featured quite often, and it was a really good looking film. The plot and script are both excellent, fueled by perfect direction and an enormous effort by the actors, it is fully realized as the dark and unsettling narrative it is meant to be. The movie pulled my in from very early on, and refused to let me go with a tightly written plot and the insane turns made not only by the plot but also the characters in the movie. Each moment felt like time was evaporating from the characters hands and as they desperately did anything they could to find answers, I found out that maybe the good guys weren't all that different from the bad guys. Fully realized characters through magnificent acting (espically by Jackman) made me feel and understand each decision they made, no matter how unsettling it was. This is a hard movie to watch, such like 12 Years a Slave, you don't really agree with what's happening, but the film is so damn good you can't look away from it. In the end, Prisoners is in my opinion one of the best films ever made, it is extremely under viewed but those who have seen it have witnessed a masterpiece in film and hopefully appreciated if at least half as much as I do",

In a chilling opening sequence they disappear after a Thanksgiving dinner from their utterly normal suburban street.\n\nUltimately, the film is about what's legitimate in a civilised society. Hugh Jackman is fantastic as Keller Dover, the father of one of the girls, who very quickly takes the law into his own hands, and will stop at seemingly nothing, acting purely on hunches and his own prejudices. \n\nMy concern about the film's own prejudices is that he's portrayed mostly as the protagonist, the character with all the agency, whereas Terrence Howard  (his friend and father of the other missing girl) is conflicted, struck with deference to the law and the authorities, rendered helpless by liberal angst and weak where Keller is strong and decisive. The film also renders their wives mostly useless. Hmmm...\n\nBetween them and the horror of their missing children is Jake Gyllenhaal, excellent in one of his 'quiet' performances. \n\nIt's true that there's little triumphalism on display in the finale, there's no great redemption or satisfaction to be had from Keller's vigilante approach.\n\nThis is a film of no little skill - the cinematography and direction is terrific, and it's shot through with unease. But it does seem to be taking itself VERY seriously, and this grim intensity is pretty wearing by the end.",

What dangers these parts may bring, it's darker and hidden, but we are prepared to handle when it comes to handle when we have to become it. We are in prison ed in what we lost, what we have to live with, what changes us, what we don't know, what justice is left in this world, what we can't get back anymore. When what was taught to us to be prepared, we weren't. When what little civility we enjoyed, we no longer have anymore, a painful reminder of what was taken from us that is contained all within ourselves. We might bring those whom share in this tragedy equally, but they are not like us (high). We might bring the institutions to help, but they can do so little, when your invested in this tragedy more than they are and don't follow the rule of law to solve a mystery but our gut instinct as a patriarch of the household. When this sort of this is unearthed as common, in a small town when this sort of thing uncommonly thing doesn't happen. We are imprisoned even more with new knowledge of this happening, and we weren't even prepared. Stuck and contained in this misery, unable to get out, escape, waiting, praying, surrounded by other prisoners around us that suffer the same misery. We live to console eachother, and turn on eachother, then turn ourselves. While we say we could do better, we have to try, we have to do something, anything, we say that it isn't enough, we have to continue trying. There is so much other can do, as they have to continue on with their life, while others have to carry on with other things, responsibilities. When we say to ourselves what to do now, whether to give up, grieve, wait longer, blame each other, ourselves. When all we want is it back. We can go easy, hard on everyone and ourselves. What unearth's in us is this wild beast that we don't know existed.existed . We release what previously impridon, and imprison our civility and sanity. When we live this double life, hidden from the world, we hate it that only we know. When we have other responsibilities that we neglect to be imprisoned, what our mind is no longer reliable when it plays tricks on us or can't understand the entire truth, or when somethings play tricks on us, we don't know. We cling on to an ounce of hope. When we have breaks, tough breaks, leads, some knowledge, no knowledge, it all rattles our brain to what moral compass and direction to take. We have restraint that we always carry that tells us to wait, don't do anything irrational, think twice, trust in others, but time runs out. What goes on our minds that breaks us, when all we care is what goes on in those effected mind. What goes in those whom are sick's mind. When we cling to hope, but we reveal how dark this world is, we are haunted in our dreams and reality of this tragedy, we can't sleep. We contemplate whether we are ready for hard hitting news, when we have to handle things very delicately. When we are no different then those whom are sick in how hard we hit, that let the beasts attack one another in this civil world. Our rage over powers our logic at times. When we can no longer stop hitting or hating ourselves we no longer know how to live and go on. When we can just medicate ourselves enough to escape and not deal with it all. When we can just disappear, vanish from reality and existence with a simple drug.\n***************************************************************************\nWhen we don't see somethings coming when we don't need to think our life is headed in such directions that we enjoy the company of our friends and family thst we don't need to feel like prisoners. When we see within a sudden moment our life turns a different direction and we are imprisoned in a moment we can't get out from. When we don't see why our mind goes different directions not knowing, we accept our new state of mind imprisoned in our own emotional & mental breakdown. When we see that we would search everywhere in every direction to free those from their prisons we wish were there to release them from. When we see trying to escape some directions we head to other directions when its the most sure thing to break out of prisons. When we see that being around certain institutions and systems any case can turn any direction whether we rely on the prison system or our own. When we see that following every lead can lead us to any direction when every clue brings us closer to breaking out of our prisons. When we do see that others deserve to head the direction towards prison when they themselves understand what threats they are if they are when let loose. When we see how such directions can lead to nowhere and living in such prisons for an eternity we can live with it. When we see some solutions that direct us away from the light is to go deeper in the dark and create our own prisons and prisoners so they know how we feel. When we see such prisons are too unbearable to take that we take a different direction on ourselves. When others see some directions have worked in the past that they get what they want by simply ubducting and imprisoning things that they couldn't get another way we don't see what others are like that can imprison more then they keep. When we see how our actions can lead to other actions that changes the direction of how life goes that can either liberate us from captivity or keep us there forever. When we dont see what we store within us while we enjoy much happiness that we experience that we dont see we also store misery when life changes our direction and the vary thing we imprison is released and the vary thing we release we imprison we dont know what we are capable of doing. When we don't see the countless lives that have been imprisoned but others reckless actions and what directions they took or what we took to say whether it was right or wrong when there is no direction as to how to handle such life changing events but to sit, wait and live with it. When we still need to see everything to its clarity to focus our attention and direct it towards any others who remain prisoners that we free them from such captivity before it's too late.",

            "content": "Prisoners is the most tightly plotted 153-minute movie you'll ever see. It's a masterpiece of the crime genre that covers a lot of ground, but every crumb, clue, and detail dropped by director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski is essential to its (murky-ish) resolution. Comparisons to films like Se7en and Zodiac are inevitable because of the films' shared genre and dark look/tone. Prisoners, however, is a different beast entirely. Not only is it a step up in terms of quality (yep), but it packs an emotional punch throughout that's tough to sit with and damn near impossible to shake. It's the perfect way to kick off the fall movie season and a definite contender for my best film of 2013.\n\nIt's Thanksgiving in rural Pennsylvania, and Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his family are spending the holiday with their close friends and neighbors, the Birches. When the youngest of both clans, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) run off to play, there's nothing on their parents' mind other than leftovers, but when they don't turn up and can't be found anywhere, everyone understandably panics.\n\nThe police, led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), pick up the primary suspect rather quickly. The girls were seen playing near an RV that's owned by Alex Jones (Paul Dano), and when Loki moves in on him, he tries to get away. Unfortunately, they can't charge him with anything after a forensic sweep of the RV turns up nothing, but that's not good enough for Keller. He grabs Alex outside of the home where he lives with his Aunt Holly (Melissa Leo), and with the help of Joy's father, Franklin (Terrence Howard), he chains Alex up at a run-down property he owns and starts torturing him for information. If the police won't do anything, he's prepared to take matters into his own hands.\n\nThat's just Prisoners' first 30 minutes or so. It ultimately follows a remarkable number of threads-each one darker than the last-before the whole tale is told. Villeneuve, making his English-language debut following the searing drama Incendies, teases each thread in such a way that you know it will be integral to the story as a whole. You know this because you've seen this movie before. It's a crime film that's built knowing decades of genre conventions exist and will be necessarily followed if we're to travel from point A to point B successfully. But Prisoners overcomes the trappings of feeling overly familiar by paying attention to detail and keeping every ball in the air-something studio thrillers just can't pull off (or don't care to try pulling off) today.\n\nPrisoners' supremely rich character work is another essential aspect to its success. The detective character is a critical piece in this genre's puzzle, but Loki is a very special iteration of someone who's typically one-note and uninteresting. In the hands of a never-better Jake Gyllenhaal, the detective takes on a fascinating hybrid of vulnerability and hard-nosed cleverness. He figures stuff out, but he's often behind the 8-ball (sometimes tragically so). And on occasion, the trail's-gone-cold nature of the case manifests itself outwardly through Loki in dangerous ways. It's a brilliant performance.\n\nThe whole ensemble is terrific, really, with Hugh Jackman doing career-best work as an already intense father upping the intensity to a 15 out of 10 following the disappearance of his daughter. Paul Dano doesn't say much, but his creepy and pathetic (yet bizarrely sympathetic) portrayal of Alex fits the film perfectly. Melissa Leo is so out-there playing Alex's aunt, but like Dano, she's absolutely magnetic. Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and others complete the deep principal cast, and all excel in smaller roles.\n\nThe film is a spectacular editing showcase, and Roger Deakins' dark, small-town-influenced cinematography is among the year's best. And Villeneuve and Guzikowski-not content to simply satisfy their audience on a visceral level-touch on religion and rural American values in interesting and non-judgemental ways. Simply put, Prisoners is a one-of-a-kind movie-something that's as thought-provoking as it is emotionally involving, as well-acted as it is well-crafted, and as good as anything else this year.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/prisoners-review/",

I absolutely loved this movie. Villeneuve's story telling mixed with a blend of intense suspense, drama, and emotion, perfectly accommodates a beautiful mystery thriller. Hugh Jackman in the film plays one of the main dads whose girl has gone missing. This is by far the best we've seen of him in awhile because his performance is top notch. Jackman gives an excellent portrayal of a father going insane and that will do literally anything to get his daughter back. Gyllenhaal just gets better as he keeps making movies. There is no role this guy can not do and it is a true pleasure watching this man act. After viewing Prisoners, the film will definitely leave an emotional scar on you. Villeneuve is afraid to expose his dark side. He takes this movie as far as it gets on the creepy aspect and will send you chills throughout the whole the movie. The film is two and a half hours long but don't let the run time scare you. Prisoners' mysterious plot will have your eyes and ears glued to the screen listening to every tiny little detail because being extremely attentive while watching this movie is very important.    I also enjoyed the setting of the film and the way it looked on screen. The cold environment added to the chilling aspect even more. Prisoners will haunt you with its eerie story but will leave you utterly impressed with its heart racing storyline.",

There are characters that are thrown in (like the priest) just to call into question who the kidnapper is, and when the movie is 2 and a half hours those parts need to just be cut. And I like Hugh Jackman but his performance is really bad and over the top. I feel like this movie was trying to be like Zodiac, but did not even come close.",

That's the scenario in the crime drama/thriller \"Prisoners\" (R, 2:33).\n\nWhen the young daughters of two neighbors go out to play after their families share Thanksgiving dinner together and then no one can find the girls, the panic is immediate and gut-wrenching.  The helplessness of these two sets of parents (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as Keller and Grace Dover and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as Franklin and Nancy Birch) is compounded when the police release a person of interest named Alex Jones (played brilliantly by Paul Dano) for lack of evidence.  Despite the fact that Alex has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, Keller is convinced that Alex knows something. He takes matters into his own hands and goes much farther than even the most devoted of parents could imagine.  Keller is willing to do anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to extract the information he needs to find these two little girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is doing what he can to solve the case, and even seems willing to go a little outside the law to do it, but keeps coming up empty.\n\nThe tension gradually but steadily builds as these parents know that time is running out for their missing children. Clues in the case are scant and hints as to where this story is going are there on the screen, but seem too trivial to matter - until they do. The plot twists and ultimate reveals are shocking, but the film's real power is in the questions it forces us to ask - and keep asking after the film is over. The script is smart enough to provide us sufficient closure to justify the emotional investment we've made in this story, but still leaves it open-ended enough to give us something to think about after the credits roll. The unusually long run time may make you feel like a prisoner, but the complex, well-directed and very well-acted story (mostly) justifies the film's length. \"B+\"",

The acting and script are fantastic, in particular Hugh does a great job all the time as the stressed, no sleep, good guy doing terrible things in order to save his daughters life.  Everything is bleak, and when they discover something to seems to look up, only to be crushed again.  It's a great story from beginning to end, always has our attention, but the second half really takes off by being intense not because of shootouts or fighting but with how well what is going on is portrayed, plus how realistic and terrible the things that are going on are.  From being shot, to suicid, to the discovery of cloths, and the torture of those who can't physically save themselves.  It's a roller-coaster watch and amazingly well done, there's simply nothing that was done wrong.

They work together and against each other, and with the help of Villeneuve with his pan-out technique, they deliver an end that is the best end possible with the tools at hand.

Prisoners is about two family friends having a get together when their girls both go missing. This film is so realistically scary and very real. It truly captures how people would act when put under pressure. Everyone in this movie is amazing. Not a single performance that I thought could've been better. The movie has a very dark and creepy vibe throughout the whole movie and keeps you guessing throughout. The twist is very satisfying and it makes sense. This movie has a great cast and a great script. Prisoners is probably the best movie of 2013. I had only one problem with the movie. The ending. At first, when the ending came, it felt rushed and abrupt, it didn't make sense. After the movie was done, it had me thinking a while. After a while of thinking, it clicked. The ending isn't a big problem but it felt like the movie just ended. You have to think for a while to really find the true meaning of the ending. Other than that, this is a PERFECT film that I highly encourage you to check this one out in theaters. \n\nPrisoners: 5/5 stars",

But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?\n\nI thought this film was great even though it was slow at times. I enjoyed the acting, It also was a real emotional movie, It was not predictable, and it was not a confusing movie and it was very original \n\nMy favorite scene of the movie was when Loki shoved his stuff off his desk. I liked this scene bc it changed the mood of the film and it showed that Loki was becoming unhinged. \n\nThe actor who gave the best performance to me was Hugh Jackman. He owned every scene he was in he portrayed the characters emotions so well. What he did different was the good guy became a bad guy by the end of the film. My favorite character though was Loki. He brang some much needed comic relief to a very depressing movie. \n\nI would give this film a 8.7 rating. There was great acting. I thought the movie was too long to tell the story effectively. I thought they could have ended the movie better. My ending would be Mr. Dover reuniting with his daughter and family. \n\nOverall i would recommend this movie to any Jake Gyllenhaal fan and any crime fans. Good overall movie.",

            "content": "How far would you go to protect your family? Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is facing every parent's worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter, Anna, is missing, together with her young friend, Joy, and as minutes turn to hours, panic sets in. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?... \n\nThe topic of \"Prisoners\" is without no doubt one of the more difficult things a human being can go through. A missing child and when minutes turns into hours into days every second is valuable. There\u00b4s an emotional complexity in the film and the sense of dread/something terrifying lurking in the darkness is so apparent you can touch it. Denis Villenueve has managed to put together this strong movie without losing the focus of the topic and getting the absolutely best out of every actor/actress in the film. Hugh Jackman is magnificent (one of his best performances showing all the emotional states you can imagine), Paul Dano is great as the pacified Alex and the same goes for Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello and Melissa Leo. I love the layers in the film and Villenueve keeps you in his grip until the end part in which you start to grasp the connecting dots before the conclusion. The weight in the movie lays on the male counterparts and all the females are less prominently in the film. This gives maybe a less balanced script, but it\u00b4s not stealing the focus of the film. \"Prisoners\" is truly engaging throughout the running time despite not maybe adding a revolutionary point of view on a classic theme.",

You have to follow it and it does not have a narrative guiding the viewer along or summing it up at the end with a nice bow so some might not pick up on everything. It does come full circle at the end and it fills the plot holes pretty much at the last minute then it rolls credits. I can usually pick up clues to how it will end and put together the maze right away but it didn't just end there...\"hope for the best, prepare for the worst\".  Like some other reviews I read it maintains enough plausibility to be believable that it could really happen or has happened and after it was over I just stared at the screen processing what I saw. Anyone who is a parent will find this especially difficult to watch because you keep thinking about what you would do- and how far you would go.  Would I become capable of things that happened in the chain of events if I thought I would get my girl back?  What if I never could get her back- would I recover?  Fantastic acting by Jackman- he had the stand out performance with of course Gyllenhaal at close second.  This one will stay in my collection and next time around I look forward to seeing what I may have missed now that I know how it ends.",

            "content": "As any parent, imagine your worst nightmare, imagine your child had been kidnapped from you in broad day light, with very little idea of who done it and a growing fear of as time goes by what you may find. Prisoners takes this idea and turns it into something totally raw, powerful and at some points extremely intense to watch. On thanksgiving day the Keller and Birch family unite to celebrate the festivities, in a small little town, in a small little street. With all the excitement going on, both families daughters, who are no older than 8, ask if its okay to head back to the Dover household, a 2 minute walk, to pick up a toy. After some ground rules are made off the children go and that is where it all goes horribly wrong. With nothing more to go on, than a dodgy looking RV parked on the street, the families turn frantic and soon enlist the help of Detective Loki, a left field cop, who has aced every assignment given to him. Soon suspects begin to come out the woodwork, leaving both families to do what they think is right for the good of their children. Looking at this cast, its hard to imagine the package you may receive here, not that they are bad, but there are some huge names in here, leaving you wondering how far the film will take it. All i'll say is do not worry, every single actor, minus a few stereotypically written lines or situations knock the entire piece into the stratosphere. Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard and Viola Davis are all on top form as the parents, the dynamic between them all is phenominal, ranging from Maria Bello's completely torn apart and useless wife to Hugh Jackman's fiery anger. Everyone here is really on fire. Loki is played outstandingly by Jake Gyllenhall, his mix of intensity and profesionalism, with added mannerisms, are a joy to watch. His performance is best served when dealing with Hugh Jackman or his captain, who wont stop riding his ass. Paul Dano and Melissa Leo put in a thunderous, performance as the main suspect and his aunt. Both of them go to such lengths to look and sound so different from their usual, your actually pleasantly surprised by the time you work out, who it is your actually watching add to this mix of powerhouse performances. Add to this some extremely creepy cinematography, harking back to John Carpenters Halloween, with slow tracking wide shots, that make everything seem voyouristic or long one takes, in particular a torture scene which literally looks like it was nailed in 1 take and your onto a winner. The entire town feels dank and winteresque, giving you this feeling of dread and hopelessness. The lighting is creepy and emotional and the grade on this thing is dulled down, to make it look less big budget and more real life. So whats wrong with the film? Well a couple of things, first off there are some pacing and editing issues. The film is over 2 and a half hours long, which is fine, but at points you literally feel like your backtracking in order to show how torturous this all is, half an hour could have easily been shaved off this and it would have been all the better for it. Also the film likes to fade to black just before major points of relieve happen, yet again, i get why this is done, at some points it works astoundingly well. But at points in treads on giving you no relieve what so ever, that you really aren't sure what the bigger picture is trying to be. Also the film spends a stupid amount of time of a drawing of a puzzle, only for it to turn into something so stupid and throwaway, had they actually done something intelligent with this, id have gladly sat an extra half hour i just wanted shaved off watching them add another thick layer onto the piece. finally the ending, I will not spoil it but its so off kilter that your left kind of buzzing about like a dying bee in the wind. Very little exposition is given to the final 15 minutes and because of this, you just feel like it was a ploy to turn one final twist on the audience. Other than that, this film is a thrilling and emotional, pitch black piece. I highly reccomend it.",

Prisoners is a film that pushes the boundaries of moralistic values, it crosses a line that we hope to never have to cross in a situation we pray we never have to be in.\nKeller Dover played by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine, Les Mis\u00e9rables) and his wife Grace played by Maria Bello(Payback, The Secret Window) attend a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbours Franklin played by Terrence Howard (Iron Man, Hustle & Flow) and Nancy Birch played by Viola Davis (How to get away with murder, The Help). Their 2 young daughters, Anna and Joy go outside to play but never return. An investigation is launched with Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Nightcrawler, Brokeback Mountain)arresting the prime suspect being a young man with the IQ of a ten year old whose RV was spotted where the young girls were last seen. As time drags on and the girls remain missing slowly desperation sets in and Keller decides to take matters into his own hands.... Once again I want to say so much about the plot but if I do I'd be breaking my own rules and giving away so much.\nThe plot is so interesting, I loved it, I loved the way the story in its entirety was played out, and I loved the characters and how well they were played. Hugh Jackman proves once again why he is so sought after in the film industry he was so convincing as the desperate father I'm surprised there was no Oscar buzz about his performance. Not only Hugh though, his fellow cast members were just as engaging and hypnotic. A perfect cast in my opinion. Jake Gyllenhaal (who did win Best Supporting Actor of the Year Award at the 2013 Hollywood Film Festival) was mesmerising with his character as well. The other stand out feature for me though was the cinematography it was amazing and really feel it helped the story teller tell his amazing tale; once again I was extremely impressed by the visuals. I don't really know the director Denis Villeneuve's other works but I can tell he is a man of talent and I'll be looking him up to see what else he has done.\nPrisoners will leave you feeling desperate and curious, running at a little under 3hrs it does take its toll as well, I'm not sure it really needed to be that long but for the outcome it does work and you hardly notice the time. The film is very disturbing in nature, has some very graphic scenes so not one for the kids. Be prepared for a magical ride with this one it'll have you'll be running a full gauntlet of emotions and I'm so glad to say the twists and turns the film takes throughout only make it so much better.",

            "content": "Interesting movie, albeit with extremely dark overtones. There is a constant abandonment of certainty in the sense that the perpetrator of the kidnapping is completely elusive. Furthermore, Keller Dover pinpoints the alleged kidnapper and insists that the police take him into custody until the police obtain information from him. When the police let the alleged kidnapper go, Alex loses his cool and takes matters into his own hands. From this point on, we see how quickly the tables can turn and how the kidnapping of a child can fuel desperate and violent actions to the alleged kidnapper who becomes a prisoner at the hands of Keller Dover.\n\nKeller Dover and Detective Loki's actions fuel much of the movie. Keller Dover is determined to find out the truth behind the kidnapping for himself, while Detective Loki follows a more rational and strategic approach to identifying the potential kidnapper. Detective Loki has his fair share of looking out for potential suspects and eventually finds Bob Taylor who is acting suspiciously at a candlelight vigil, and who runs away when seen. Although Bob Taylor is not critical to the plot, there could have been a better explanation of his story and the significance of the snakes and mazes to him than what we are given. Much of what is revealed about his life is determined posthumously, and we are left without the immediate and possibly intense story of the character to provide us with more background about what could be happening with the two little girls.\n\nKeller Dover continues to torture Alex Jones, not realizing that he has the wrong victim and is torturing Alex without reason. There are many clues that are pieced together to reveal the actual kidnapper and when these come together, the story becomes more interesting.\n\nStill, there is some information missing from the plot that I am curious about, and the movie did not succeed in filling in these gaps. What is the significance of the mazes? Do the mazes refer to a physical or psychological concept? There are a number of other plot gaps that could be better explained by the movie.",

            "content": "Rating: 9/10\n\nI think Richard Roeper nailed it with his review of this excellent suspense/thriller.  This film is so good that it approaches the heights of similar crime masterpieces as Silence of the Lambs and Zodiac (one of my 10 favorite films).  It only falls short because its length is a bit too long.  Now, typically I'm last person to complain about a film's length because my mindset has always been that there's no such thing as \"too much of a good thing\" when it comes to movies.  Zodiac, for instance, happens to be a longer film than Prisoners by about 9 minutes, assuming you're watching the Director's Cut (it's only 5 minutes longer than the theatrical version and I've never watched that).  However, the difference between the films is that Zodiac keeps the facts, plot, and intrigue going at full force throughout the entire length of the picture, while Prisoners has a few moments that are arguably inconsequential to the story.  That isn't to say it has bad moments, because it does not, but given the film's pacing and slow-developing plot threads it could have benefitted from tighter editing, whereas the lengthier Zodiac uses all of its time very wisely.  However, this is a very minor issue and hardly any kind of deterrent.  If you haven't seen Prisoners, it is very well worth the time.  It is thoughtful, disturbing, chilling, and has many outstanding performances by every actor/actress.",

The subject is just so disturbing, all the more because its so real; I mean, its the stuff you hear about in the news and its sad, but as a parent, its the stuff of nightmares. On one hand, I can understand where Mr. Dover (Jackman) is coming from; I mean, given the same circumstances, I can't say I wouldn't do the same thing. Anyhow, the subject matter was disturbing and the actors were incredible; Jackman, of course was awesome. Jake Gyllenhaal was creepier than the accused abductor, I kept expecting a plot twist that he's the guilty party for some reason. Paul Dano  is such an underrated actor but he was spectacular in this film and Melissa Leo was absolutely brilliant!

So he takes matters into his own hands. Right away we Biblically know this is wrong. The Bible clearly states vengeance is not ours. Keller abandons faith when tribulations occur in his life. He turns to everything, but God. We are called to rely on God in hard times. The film shows the fallen and sinful nature of man, and how desperate and depraved we become without God. In the film, a character states that killing children is how we wage war against God, it turns people into demons.\n\n\"Prisoners\" is a bold film that stands on it's own two feet. It is a little too long, but it's Villeneuve's dedication to \"taking it slow\" that renders this unrelenting picture so memorable, and one of 2013's very best.",

One can't help suppose that the makers constantly had studio representatives dialling in sunnier alternatives. Many of the features of aforementioned bleak, grim storytelling are present but ultimately, it's merely Hollywood tippy toeing into independent territories and messing it all up. There are some wonderful moments and episodes but ultimately the punches are pulled. The children, naturally, look like the only only thing they've gone missing from is a Gap ad, Hugh Jackman only looks comfortable when he's allowed to pound his fists and the maze conundrum is never satisfactorily explored. However, Jake Gyllenhaal, of whom I'm not a huge fan, is absolutely excellent and the tone and palette are consistently superb. Definitely worth a watch but not as emotionally fulfilling as it could've been.",

I had my heart set on the Insidious two, which was supposed to scare the life out of you. My buddy had other ideas. He decided to drag me along to Prisoners. At the time I hadn't heard of the movie and when he described it to me I nearly backed out on him, but being the good friend that I am I went any way. \t\t\t\nAs we took our seats I was positive I just blew another 10 bucks on a movie that probably wasn't worth three dollars. But when the theatre doors opened 153 minutes later I came out a new man. It was brilliant to say the least. A beautifully constructed film with grade A actors and spectacular scenery. Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman battle each other as Keller Dover (Jackman) searches for his suddenly kidnapped daughter, Anna.\nThe audience quickly gets the creepy vibe of this movie in an early scene as the camera pans across a beaten, rusty, old RV sending chills down your spine. Keller Dover is certain that the kidnapper has something to do with this RV, but Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) thinks otherwise. As the movie continues more disturbing and frightening scenes occur. When Keller finds the man from the RV he decides to take it into his own hands without the knowledge of the police. Beating and torturing the young man found in this RV parked outside his house. \nThe star studded line up made up of Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, and Viola Davis gave everything they had for this film. Jackman overpowered the man in the RV with his large and powerful physical stature while Gyllenhaal played a brilliant detective. Now, Gyllenhaal was not nominated for any awards from this movie, but he should have. He played a sly detective with a slight tick and he absolutely nailed it. From beginning to end Gyllenhaal had me entertained with his quick compressed blinks and the toothpick he had in the side of his lip to help keep his tick under control. He had a calm laidback demeanor with a slight temper at times making it the perfect combination for a detective. \nThe films setting in a cold Pennsylvania town is exactly the location this film needs. A Pennsylvania November is filled with cold dark nights and foggy days giving it the ideal setting for the movie. The audience can feel the creepiness of the film just by the location it takes place in.\nAlthough this film has a scary feeling to it, I'd still encourage it to most audiences over the age of 13, whether or not you like scary movies. Throughout the movie you feel as if you can determine what will happen next, and you would be completely wrong. By far one of the best movies of 2013 and I'd encourage anyone of any type of audience to see this film. It is the perfect combination of actors who fill their role perfectly, and a setting that is spot on. If you see one movie from the year 2013 it must be Prisoners. You won't regret it.",

In spite of the big names on the cast, Villeneuve maintains all the aspects that conform the integrity of his directing. Shots that show the tension of the situation, and clear details that impact you immediately. \n\nThe story is slowly paced, and has many twists along side it, some working better than others, but what really prevents the running time from being a bothering aspect, is the greatly constructed characters and the respecting solid acting's from the cast. Jackman's troubled and agressive father demands your attention, but it's Gyllenhaal's meditative cop who really stands out for me. \n\nThe grimy and bleak tone of the story is portrayed with expertise by the masterful hand of cinematographer Roger Deakins, and this really adds to the constant atmosphere of suspense. For this reason, and Villeneuve's style of direction, one might draw comparations with David Fincher's style, something that isn't actually bad per se.\n\nThe main problem with the film is its heavy-handed religious symbolism, which never really adds anything to the actual story line, and is deeply under-used. Aside from that, there are some points in the story that seem somewhat out of place, but still, these don't really ruin the viewing experience.\n\nOverall, Prisoners is a greatly crafted Thriller, with outstanding acting's, award-worthy photography and an interesting story that keeps you hooked for its somewhat overlong running time.",

            "content": "I'm having a lot of trouble thinking of a better film to come out in 2013. 'Prisoners' has almost everything going for it: an A list cast and director, a great story, top notch script and boat loads of tension. It fits together as intricately as the maze in its logo, and keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat until the last frame.\n\nThis film is successful for all the reasons listed above, but the story itself is the major strength. It is a slow burn style thriller that ramps up the tension in an incredibly palpable way. Starting out as a fairly straightforward abduction story, it quickly escalates into a full fledged frenzy. Twist after turn keeps the audience genuinely unsure of what is going to happen next and where it is heading. This is the ultimate job of a thriller, and this one stays one step ahead at all times. Despite this escalation, it never looses sight of what it wants to accomplish, keeping its focus on its characters and their inner struggles in a very intimate way. The ending is just right, leaving you exactly when it is supposed to.\n\nIts characters are brought to life by some really good performances up and down the cast. Both Jackman and Gyllenhaal turn in performances worthy of being called their career bests. Gyllenhaal in particular throws himself into a very different role than he has played before, and his method acting and body language really sell it. I would cite Jackman for overacting in a few scenes, but he is very good as the father who comes to the uneasy but unapologetic realization that he will do unthinkable things to save his family. It is a very interesting dichotomy to watch someone pushed to that limit, and it leaves you with no real judgment on the morality of his character. The rest of the cast is rounded out by some great supporting performances from solid vets like Leo, Dano, Bello and Howard.\n\nThe direction is another extremely strong suit here. If you told me this was directed by David Fincher, I just might believe you. Aside from a very Fincheresque story, the direction is very much his style. Striking high contrast and lack of color saturation almost mimicking black and white photography combine with a masterful use of shot composition and symmetry that really echos Finchers directorial eye. Villeneuve is a director to watch. He's been around awhile, and while isn't particularly prolific I will be keeping an eye out for his future projects. \n\nThere are a few minor issues I had with the film. First and foremost is its length. I'm all for a director using as much time as necessary to tell their story exactly the way they want, but I ended up feeling 153 minutes was a little much. I feel a good 15 minutes could have seen the cutting room floor without sacrificing much if anything. Another qualm I had is that after all the pain the villain ends up inflicting, I wanted to see them suffer a bit rather than the quick, arbitrary ending they are given. Is that wrong? Maybe, but I can't say I have any shame in wanting to see such a detestable character get exactly what's coming to them. A few minor issues with pacing slow things down a bit in the middle act as well. These negatives said, they are all very minor complaints that really don't do much to detract from such a great final product.\n\nConsidering the overall artistic vision, depth and effectiveness of this film on all fronts, I have to say I am fairly shocked of its lack of critical recognition and fanfare. In my opinion, this was surely deserving of several Oscar nominations and probably wins. Yet, it remains unheralded and relatively unknown to the general public for some reason. But don't let the lack of popular praise fool you: this is a grade A thriller from top to bottom, and I'd place it right at the top of best pictures of the year.",

Veteran Coen Brothers cinematographer Roger Deakins lends his expertise to newcomer writer Aaron Guzikowski and Director Denis Villeneuve. You can certainly see the influence of Deakins throughout the film and his beautiful take on reality in a chaotic situation.\n\nThis is one of those films that you don't want to know a thing about before you go. You don't even want to hear people brushstroke over it because even that is something you don't want to hear. For that matter, I won't even go close to going there. I will give you a brief introduction to what you should expect. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (Maria Bello), walk down the street to their neighbors, Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis). They each have a daughter and along the course of the evening, those two daughters disappear without a trace.\n\n\"Prisoners\" is a gut-wrenching and fast running two and a-half hour movie. It is filmed in such a way that the events that unfold could involve you, your neighbor, somebody across town and on your local news. Along with the way the movie is filmed and told, it is gifted with phenomenal actors that bring the reality of the situation to the surface.\n\nIt is an exhausting an emotionally filled movie from top to bottom and its subject matter will have your stomach in knots until the credits roll. This, quite simply, is what movies are all about. Too often these days, movies make you feel nothing. Too many directors and writers are concerned with what you see and forget that first and foremost, what makes great cinema and long lasting cinema, is the feeling it leaves in your stomach and soul. At one point, Keller Dover's sadness effected me so much that I felt as if I was actually him or in the least, one of his family members or a great friend.\n\n\"Prisoners\" is the kind of movie we should be flocking to the theaters to see until Hollywood gets the message that we want to feel something. Sure, dazzle us with visuals, but until you relay empathy in your audience members, you have wasted millions of dollars and time. \"Prisoners\" is tremendous filmmaking. It is one of the best and most complete films of the year and will almost certainly be a member of the Oscar night nominees.",

Knowing that every day, every hour, every second your child could be alone, frightened, and worst of all dead. That is the dreaded crux of the core to this film. Keller (Hugh Jackman) is a rustic strong family man, raising a beautiful family. During a holiday dinner with family friends Franklin (Terrence Howard) and Nancy (Violla Davis), both of their younger daughters decide to go play outside in which they never return. The only suspect, the owner of an RV that was suspiciously parked out in the neighborhood. In comes Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) heading up the investigation of the missing children. \n\n The investigation follows a strange path of multiple suspects, neither of which are connected, and the prime suspect, the first suspect, is released from holding after having absolutely no evidence to having kidnapped the children. The prime suspect, Alex (Paul Dano), is an infantile man who knows more than he is letting on. Keller having no faith in Loki's ability to find his daughter, takes matters into his own hands, kidnapping Alex himself and keeping him \"prisoner\", torturing and abusing him trying to get the truth from him. While Loki follows multiple leads of suspicious people, clues that don't match, incidences that turn into dead ends, Keller struggles with maintaining the guise of a father searching for his lost daughter while actually spending his time punishing Alex through violence.\n\n As the tale unfolds and tragedy besets both families worrisome clues start to connect and the tenuous relationship between Keller and Loki threatens the entire investigation. Loki is plagued with the desire to save the girls. As is Keller. But their methods take them to the edge of justice careening close to the depths of vengeance.\n\n While the entire film is tense and driven by a very powerful emotion it is not the most memorable thriller that is out there. This is based solely on the story itself. The crime and solving it is not why you watch this film. You watch this film for one of the most brilliant ensemble performances from a cast of super heavy weights, all of which give fantastic gut wrenching tear jerking performances about the pain, fear, and anger of losing a child. I think it is less about it being \"memorable\" in the way Se7en or Gone Baby Gone was but the performances and the wonderful cinematography by the one and only Roger Deakins makes it a strong watch. Definitely worth a view.",

Nice acting by Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal but what is use of it if there are so many loophopes and useless scenes present. \nCan writter Aaron Guzikowski answer these question:\n1. Why Alex Jones and Bob Tayler don't tell the truth to Police.\n2. What Bob Tayler is afraid of that he kills himself?\n3. What was purpose of mazes and snakes in movie.\n4. When both of them say that the kidnapped girls are in Maze, what kind of maze it is? I see girls are simply hidden in Holly's house. What is purpose of maze here, to make viewer fool?\n5. If Alex is first suspect, why police has not searched his aunt's, jolly's, house at first place? Police reached to the stage of publishing another suspects sketch, but they simply could not thoroughly search first victims house?\n5. Why and how Officer Loki enter in Father's house? ( I mean why not other houses). I hoped he could have searched Holly house better and ended this shit at the start itself.\n4 star for acting and -3 star for story.\nSCRAP!!!!",

It perhaps isn't quite as important or Oscar-worthy as it seems to think it is, but it's a really compelling film nevertheless.\nHugh Jackman stars as a blue-collar guy whose 6-year-old daughter is kidnapped. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the detective investigating the case, in a surprisingly interesting performance. When Jackman's character quickly grows frustrated with the police's lack of progress, he decides to do some investigating himself, kidnapping a potential suspect (Paul Dano, typecast yet again as a creepy weirdo) and torturing him for information.\n\nThe movie's plot, as it moves along, can seem fairly standard, though there are definitely some late-game twists I didn't see coming. What's more remarkable about the film is its constant sense of gray, rainy misery, which is really bolstered by Roger Deakins's work. The movie doesn't have as many pointedly stylish shots as, say, Skyfall, but it does a great job with shadows and darkness. It's arguably a good example of a color film noir, at least in the visual style of certain scenes. To be honest, at its core, this could have been an average movie, but the talent of everyone involved raised it considerably. It's a good example, not of style over substance, but of style aiding substance.",

Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic in this and Maria Bello gives an emotional performance that you can see how broken her character was after her child had been kidnapped. Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, Viola Davis, and Terrence Howard are really good that there is no actor that wasn't bad in this. The script by Aaron Guzikowski is very well-written that it really made the film more complex than to get the audience invested, but not too complex to lose the viewers and get very confused. The characters are simple, but memorable enough that you really want the main characters to find their daughters, even when they take Paul Dano's character hostage.

The mystery keeps you guessing until the end the reveal is far less shocking as the transformation each character undergoes. The film is disturbing, but not so disturbing that it's inaccessible. Instead, the film digs under your skin and tries to include you in the suffering the parents are going through. You want answers not because you're curious about the outcome, but because you genuinely want to see the conflict resolved. Everyone is excellent in term of performance and the film is well written.

An emotionally powerful performance doesn't always involve screaming at the top of your lungs in every scene and unfortunately that's the lasting impression I had from him here. \n\nI also found the story suffered from a few too many plot holes in my opinion. Having said that, the Denis Villeneuve did a fantastic job of creating a dark, cold, dreadful atmosphere that permeated the film and really created a sense of despair.

Hugh Jackman should have won an Academy award, playing as a dad who will do anything to find his kidnapped daughter and hia friend's daughter, even if that means they must break the law. As for the cop from Zodiac, he deserved to be nominated for an Oscar as well, as we see the change from a calm, helping cop to a mess at the end. All of the acting is great, showung the change that the situation has brought and being hurt by it so perfectly. As for the mystery it is solid, actually the most intriguing mysteey recently. The screenplay helps bring out emotion and has plenty of good lines and moments to bring, and the dark cinematography brings a tone that the movie hits perfectly. How this movie was nominated for only one Oscar, I dont know, but the Academy should be damn ashamed, since this movie packed more substantial human drama than even 12 Years a Slave, and that movie was damn good too. 4 1/2 stars, so close to 5... oh, and not for the faint hearted, some people arent big fans of it because its too dark, well so is kidnapping, so shouldnt it be?",

            "content": "Prisoners has a very strong draw. The story pulls you in almost immediately and does a great job of not letting go. The immediate premise alone is horrific to extreme levels and its possibility is so real that it can put its viewers in a very vulnerable emotional place. There are particular aspects that place viewers in this state but not in an overtly obvious way. The structure takes its time to draw us in while feeding us tiny moments of youthful innocence that serves to trigger a sentimentality that quite literally sneaks up on us. All the while at the same time we are faced with feeling of complete dread as the story unfolds.  You may begin to feel as helpless as some of the characters facing this nightmare. \n    \n       The imagery in this film is scattered but grotesquely beautiful. We have the whistle, which is always red, the images of the mazes, the Cross, snakes, and the manikins; none of which have too much purpose save for making the situation more bizarre and disturbing. The storyline all-together is intriguing enough though without all that extra imagery. Where the story truly pulls you in is in the behavior of Keller (Hugh Jackman) to the situation. I've read some believe he \"over acts\" but I don't agree with that at all given the circumstances. Keller's intensity is completely believable though his actions are extreme. Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is only slightly developed beyond his involvement of the case but we are given subtle glimpses at who he might be which suggests he is actually the perfect man for the case. He ought to be since his office seems to be fairly incompetent and leaves him without a partner on this investigation.\n\n   I felt the cinematography was sufficient but not something to lose yourself in. The editing is very good as it allows you time to soak in the moments that are the most critical. Too often do films rush us through a roller coaster while we miss all emotion stimulation. The music is dreary with its use of violins and synthesizers and does a good job working with the footage. \n\n  Prisoners is a good film for those who enjoy thrillers. I recommend giving it a watch.",

In this dark and moody scenario, Director Denis Villeneuve explores the question of what actions parents will take trying to save their children, and what rationale they will use to justify those actions.  Villeneuve uses weather to accentuate the dark mood of the film well, and we find out how religion can be used to justify the most brutal acts.

Of course the audience knows that all is not well in this suburban-Pennsylvania town; we've seen the previews, we know the story. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) knows what can go wrong as well. An out-of-work carpenter, Jackman phenomenally brings to life the survivalist mentality which has dictated and guided his life up to the beginning of the film: the day that his daughter is stolen from him. \n\nThis film is brooding,accentuated by a palate of grays and blacks, but fully brought to life by complex performances by Jake Gyllenhaal as the detective charged with returning the girls to safety, as well as Melissa Leo, who adds another polished role to her resume on par with her portrayal of Alice Ward in The Fighter. Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) plays a foil of sorts to Dover, and he always inexplicably knows where to find the dead body (he's never failed to close a case). Screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski doesn't go so far as to make us doubt Loki's motives, only to question his background and breadth of knowledge about such a dark world. We're never privy to many of these answers.\n\nIf Prisoners misses the mark anywhere, it is in length. This weighty slog thrills and holds our pulses high, but at two hours and thirty-three minutes, we're completely devoid of the ability to take any more. I liken Prisoners to getting smacked across the face, but the reward for your endurance is an extraordinary film, reaching the upper echelon of the genre. You'll be ready for a walk after the lights go up,yet the plot never drags. Like any crime thriller, certain tangents and red herrings are followed to a fault. However, these ploys successfully disguise other critical elements of the trail, enabling them to go unnoticed until their importance needs to be revisited. Loki misses these details simply because of the mass of evidence he has to investigate; Dover misses them because he is otherwise distracted in a gritty battle that is sure to test your stomach. \n\nThis film succeeds because it keeps its foot on the accelerator. A story like Prisoners has a tendency to either slow to a halt about twenty minutes before the climax, or rely on a character to break the tension from time to time.Director Denis Villeneuve decided to rise above that. Rather than cheapen a well-written script with a sideshow or a plot intermission, he keeps the tension high thanks to a deathly quiet soundtrack, a multitude of parallel stories, and depth to characters fully brought out by this incredible cast. \n\nPrisoners is taxing and cumbersome.

            "content": "For a 'catch the bad guy' film, this one is particularly divisive due to its unnerving brutality. As the film nears its end whilst only managing to become darker and more unpleasant, it's clear that the viewer is either going to be trapped in the clutches of its horrid atmosphere or they're going to have drawn the line and wished they'd never started watching to begin with. Either way, the film's commitment to its pitch-black atmosphere makes it something relatively unique for the genre.\n\nYou'll certainly feel queasy after this one and its cruelty that verges on sadism will be enough to put many off. If, like myself, you decide not to draw the line and let that go as it were then you may still feel that this film was a missed opportunity through its emphasis on being a crime thriller rather than the human drama that turns out only being a sliver of the overall work. Still, if you want a crime thriller that'll keep you engaged whilst being memorable and feeling somewhat distinct from the genre as a whole, then this is for you.\n\nThe plot just manages to tow the line between being interesting and simply becoming overly-ridiculous. It's certainly convoluted and not as smart as it wants to be (you could figure most of it out pretty early on if you tried) but it does a good job in creating convincing mystery and uncertainty within its characters as the story develops. Even if the viewer does say enough is enough as the plot twists and turns, they'll still be tied to how the characters react to these developments. It's still a little ridiculous though if I'm honest!\n\nThe cast fit well and never seem out of place. Jackman, who I'm honestly not particularly fond of, fits this role like a glove and felt like smart casting for a character that seems to be driven more by revenge than by sorrow. Gyllenhaal overdid it a little for me at times- trying a little too hard to be the damaged cop however he doesn't become a caricature and he doesn't bring the film down at all. \n\nDano ultimately doesn't get to do much which is disappointing but he plays his part well- the same could be said of Howard, Bello, and Davis, whose characters all may as well have been named 'distraught person crying' as none of them ever really step into the story in their own way. Due to its focus on atmosphere and its trying-too-hard plot, this film could easily have fallen apart with a lesser cast so its good to see them meeting expectations here.\n\nThe film has a very interesting premise as the response of Jackman's character to the abduction of his daughter serves as half of  the film's main focus, with the search for the criminal serving as the other half. This makes it stand out a little but in the end it's rather disappointing as the story veers more and more towards your typical crime thriller until Jackman's character just serves as an extension of that. The opportunities to discuss the moral and ethical implications of Davis' actions end up completely lost to the more formulaic aspects of the crime thriller parts of the story. As a result, the film slowly becomes less-interesting, despite the plot continuing to move at a decent pace.\n\nThis is my main issue with the film and there's really no excuse for it. It has a fairly significant runtime and yet it's paced well enough to avoid feeling painfully long and dragged on. Why some of this time wasn't used to focus on the moral struggle surrounding the events in the film is a question worth asking as it certainly would have enhanced the impact of the movie. It's certainly haunting when all is said and done but it's a particularly queasy feeling as opposed to an emotional one that the viewer is left with. It's an all-visceral response that this film brings out and I'd have preferred something more emotional and introspective in the end which this film didn't seem particularly interested in.\n\nOverall, if you can accept its overbearingly depressing nature, then you've got something here that stands out from your average crime thriller, even if it does seem to have let itself down a little.",

            "content": "\"a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller\" \nWow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. \n\nA spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn't feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There's one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters' actions and the characters themselves, and there's the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can't possibly (always) be the \"goody-two-shoes\" heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie's events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk. \n\nAnd holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles. \n\nSpeaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you've left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that's transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year's Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding. \n\nFurthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and \"fun,\" such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that I'll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let's hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did.",

A lot of the film's exposition establishes Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) as a survivalist -- a right-wing, anti-establishmentarian -- in order to explain his extreme behavior later.  But this theme remains undeveloped.  I can imagine a good film that questions whether a man's personal moral compass should override the moral compass that most reasonable people agree to, but by the second act, the film devolves into torture porn and the generic dramatic questions overtake the film's philosophical musings.\nJackman has never been an impressive actor, and what depth we see in Keller comes from the script, not his performance.  The same can be said of Jake Gyllenhaal, and unfortunately the plot renders Maria Bello catatonic halfway through the film.  The best performance is by Paul Dano, who never fails to impress.\nOverall, as a thriller, Prisoners fits the genre, but as anything more, it's close but not quite.",

Jake Gyllenhaal and Paul Dano, however, are both great all the way through; and the way director Denis Villeneuve retains the sense of dread throughout is almost masterful. \n\nWhat's really scary is that Jackman's character is actually capable of going so far mentally outside his comfort zone to get his daughter back. Now over the past few years I personally have learned a lot (and am still learning) about self-control; but his character is scary; unfortunately Jackman's over-acting really does not help this character's credibility- in fact, I had a hard time believing him. He achieved the basics of the performance- character establishment- but none of the more complex parts of the performance, unfortunately. \n\nOverall, it's a very good movie- difficult to watch, but I will say it's worth it.",

For almost a year now friends have been telling me that I needed to see this and it is very realistic and all that other stuff. So I decided one weekend, \"What the hell\" and rent the movie only to finish it off and say to myself \"WHAT THE HELL?\" From I hear this is something that people say that it is one of the best movies of 2013. It's one of those movies that did really well at the Toronto International Film Festival so I can say that there are some I get what they're talking about and some things that I can't. This is a pretty dark film and a really cool mystery, so let me dive right on in this movie.\n\nThe movie brings a lot of things to the table with one of which being is this right or wrong when you do what you have to do in order to find your children? Like the degree to which they lose all sense of their sensibility to become this crazy person who morality becomes neither here nor there and the only thing that matters is them and their own shit. Hugh Jackman gives, without a doubt, one of the best performances that I have ever seen in his entire career. He delivers a mixture of seriousness and animosity that makes you believe that there are people like this that do exist out there in the real world. I mean if you put his character in a room with the Hugh Jackman version of Wolverine, there's no doubt that he'll beat the ever loving shit out of the mutant. I'm going to tell you something else, if you want someone to play nervous in your movies then get Terrance Howard. This guy plays nervous like nobody else. I loved Jake Gyllenhaal in here as well as plays this stressed out detective who is constantly frustrated whenever he can't solve a clue or when the parents are his back about the case. Everyone else in here from Paul Dano to Maria Bello, and even Melissa Leo were spectacular in this movie and not a single role felt like it was wasted. One complaint I had with this is that this movie is two and a half hours and there are scenes in here that just drags on for so long that they could've easily taken it out. The whole middle act has this whole morality play that is not really going anywhere about Hugh Jackman having this guy tied up certain that he is the one who did it and you're like \"Okay maybe we should have something else happening in the plot that moves the story along. It could lose some people when they watch this, but it didn't lose me. Overall I enjoyed the hell out of this movie and if you have a lot of time to kill then I recommend this. This is, without a doubt, a solid four stars all the way.",

I finished watching the movie with no doubt that I didn't miss anything. Yet for several days, it hasn't left my mind. It's an uncanny accomplishment to make a film that is truly more than the sum of its parts, which is exactly what Prisoners is.\n\nI'll begin with the cast, because the acting on display here is both vitally important to the film, and excellent. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a God fearing survivalist who is disempowered from his state of readiness when his daughter is kidnapped alongside one of his neighbours. He plays the character in an extremely raw and emotionally driven way, which acts to counterbalance the cooler, collected Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He too is at the top of his game, alongside a formidable supporting cast including Terrence Howard and Viola Davis.\n\nThe exceptional cast is helped by a screenplay which never stops putting the audience through their paces...\n\nRead more",

Coming to mind, the film is heavily similar to Insomnia, probably one of Nolan's more conventional films, but the ideas and cinematic flair are still present here.  Again, the twist isn't too shocking (especially again if you know the pedigree of the casting....) but it's still one that keeps you guessing throughout the entire film.  Jackman and Gyllenhaal really carry the movie with decent performances from the supporting.  It's sadly way too long.  If the movie focused more on Loki vs Jackman's torturing, I think it could had had a slicker feel to it.  Instead, you just keep wishing it go back to the story instead of the meaningless red herrings.  Overall, it's a strong movie and a recommendation (which I don't say often), but it's more a \"one and done\" great story like Insomnia was, versus one that needs to be returned to to find everything it offers.  There is complexity in their natures, but it overall doesn't fully reach its needed potential.",

The success of the film is down to a really intricate plot and a terrific cast, all putting some magnificent and electrifying performances. Carpenter Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a very devout Catholic whose family goes for Thanksgiving dinner with their neighbours, Franklyn and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). After dinner, the families girls Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) go missing, prompting a search led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). The main suspect is Alex Jones (Paul Dano), who had an RV parked nearby, but Jones has the mental age of a little boy, and they can't prove he did it. Dover believes Jones did it, so he takes the law into his own hands, but Loki discovers some dark secrets about this particular case. It's a film you will need to watch again, as all the clues are spread throughout the film, but they're not very clear, and you will need to pay attention to. However, it all makes sense in the end, and nothing in this mystery is what it seems, and everyone, even the innocent parties, all have skeletons in the closet.",

Contrary to popular opinion, I'm not a fan of Melissa Leo. This is a pretty fun film. We have suspense and a wee taste of torture, a smidge of gore and a plethora of snakes. Neato! At two and a half hours, the length is awesome. My biggest complaint is Jake's performance. He didn't just mail it in, he sent it across the country on a mule. Shame shame, Jake, minus a half star!",

            "content": "Thanksgiving is a time of love and gratitude, cherishing jubilant moments over a warm, oven-roasted turkey around a table with family and friends. This is precisely what the Birch and Dover families, whom are neighbors and close friends, are expecting when attending a Thanksgiving dinner at the Birch residence. There is a deep sense of comfort and connectedness between the two families as they prepare for their quiet, pleasant evening. With a title like Prisoners, it comes as no surprise that the events in this film do not unfold peacefully for these charming families.\n\nThe grizzly events of Prisoners begin when Anna Dover and Joy Birch, the two six-years-olds from each respective family, decide to play outdoors. They are accompanied by their older siblings and soon come across what appears to be an abandoned RV, which the two young girls begin to climb before their older siblings force them off as they return for dinner. It is only shortly before dinner that both families realize their two six-year-old daughters are nowhere to be found, and upon searching their homes and the surrounding area, panic begins to set in. \n\nThe authorities are contacted immediately, and Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, leads the case. He takes a detailed account of the events that took place before the girls went missing, and shortly thereafter, he finds the RV by which the girls had played. A young man residing inside the RV is then arrested for the accused kidnapping, but further investigation proves it is highly improbable for this man to be the skilled kidnapper-he has the IQ of an average 10-year-old and is awkwardly simple-minded. The plot thickens as Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, decides to take matters into his own hands and find the two missing girls himself, using unskillful detective-work and sadistically violent measures as he sees fit. Keller and Detective Loki progressively discover that there are a multitude of complex clues they must piece together in this intense enigma if they hope to find the two young girls alive.\n\nWhile slow-paced at times, Prisoners never fails to keep you gripped, scanning every shot for clues and questioning the trustworthiness of each character. Like the title of the film, we too become prisoners of the crime and the agitation the young girls and their distraught families are experiencing. Prisoners is by no means a blissful or straightforward film. However, it reaches deeply into the heart of humanity and the darkness that we are capable of as human beings, whether for love or for malice.",

            "content": "Prisoners had a lot to live up to. Just look at that cast; Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, etc. All actors at least nominated for Oscars, if not having actually won them. There is a lot of talent acting in the film, but any actor is only as good as the material they are handed. So what was the end result?\n\nIn short, the most gripping, edge of your seat film I have ever seen. I have never been floored by a movie, or infused with so much anxiety from a film. I was shaking, and hardly able to stand up from my seat as the credits rolled. I don't have many criticisms of this film myself, but I'd like to refute many of the criticism I've seen below.\nThe most common aspect of the film I've seen complained about is the length. The film is long, running at just under 2 hours and 30 minutes. It has been said that the film delves down every avenue, guiding the viewer through sequences that may not be necessary to the overall plot of the film.\n\nI couldn't disagree more.\n\nThe film may be long, but it never felt long to me because every single scene felt completely essential to the film, even if it didn't seem so at the time, by the end, it all comes together. Sure, they could have streamlined the narrative, made it a little more linear, but the film would have suffered for it. The film is littered with characters, but that long running time gives us more than enough time to spend time with them, get to know them, and let them develop properly.\n\nIt also gives the film time to completely subvert your expectations of it multiple times. There will, undoubtedly, be several times during the film that you will think you've got it all figured out, but then something will happen that completely throws you off. But then, it will do it again. And at the end, you may end up somewhere that is somewhat predictable, but the journey of how you get there is thrilling.\n\nAnother complaint I've seen echoed from several reviewers is with the brutality of the film. But the violence of the film serves a greater purpose, conveys the social commentary on display, and isn't just violence for the sake of violence or shock value. Now, the violence is shocking, but in context, and with relation to the overall narrative, it is essential. How far would a parent go to find their children? Or, what lengths would a parent go to comfort themselves, and convince themselves their child is still alive? The film asks one of these questions, but leaves it up to you to decide which one.\n\nI'd urge you, that if you see the film, pay attention and appreciate every detail. Even when you may think the narrative is losing its way, stay vigil, because the payoff for everything will be there in the end. The last 30 minutes of this film will surprise you and have you on edge like you may never have been before. Everything comes together in that span of time, but it does not feel like it is rushing towards a conclusion, in the traditional sense. It is more like it is rocketing towards a finale that is fast and frantic because it has to be.\n\nI apologize if it seems I am beating around the bushes on some of these subjects, but I absolutely abhor reviews that are unable to tell you what is great about a film without telling you exactly what happens. Spoilers are a big deal to me, and many others, and I try to keep that in mind.\n\nAlthough Hugh Jackman has top billing, to me Jake Gyllenhaal steals the show here. His character of Detective Loki is most of the time a very subdued character, but he always gives off the sense that something much more is boiling beneath the surface. And when that side of him comes out, Gyllenhaal is a complete and utter powerhouse. Don't get me wrong; Hugh Jackman does wonderful work here, but if you've seen Hugh Jackman before, even just as Wolverine, you'll know that he can pull off angry and ferocious. It's good work, but it's nothing quite out of his wheelhouse. Even all the supporting roles are great and well acted, because the receive the screen time they need to have a full arc as characters.\n\nI don't think I could gush any more about Prisoners without going into specifics, but in short, I implore you to see this movie. If you're a fan of great drama, horror, or just movies in general, this will be a very enjoyable, although somewhat brutal, breath of fresh air. If it meets all the foolish Oscar qualifying guidelines, this will, without a doubt, be one to watch in the coming award season.",

There are many levels of humanity that are explored in the film that all fall under the darker aspects of the human persona: wrath, depression, cowardliness, suspicion, deceit, etc. which in turn creates a very dark and sometimes dreary tone that may not be for everybody.

Or even more recently in the overrated \"Mystic River\" which to me felt like a gloried made-for-TV movie of the week.  More recently \"The Impossible\" dealt with a separated family (Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor) who helped each other out after a giant tsunami.\nEmpathy factor runs high on this compelling drama in which Jackman's 7- year-old daughter goes missing after a Thanksgiving rendezvous. I would say I really didn't enjoy this flick, but more or less respected what first time director Denis Villenueve was trying to accomplish with this pretzel twisting  mystery/thriller.  \nA heavily tattooed Jake Gyllenhaal is the cop assigned to help Jackman's Keller Dover track down the logistics in figuring out the dynamics of the strange case.  \nPaul Dano, so good in the little seen \"The Girl Next Door\" and Paul Anderson's \"There Will be Blood\" underplays his role as Alex Jones, a kid who has no more than an 8th grade education.  Even though one feels his pain, one can't help but to be dumbfounded by his predicament.  \nRounding out the cast in great support are Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Oscar winner Melissa Leo as Holly Jones, Alex's caregver.\nA tough flick to endure, \"Prisoners\" at least ends with a glimmer of surprise and hope by film's end.\n\n(B-)",

If you haven't seen Zodiac, by the way, you should clear out the next 3 hours of your life and do so now.  Prisoners, the story of the lives that unravel when two girls suddenly go missing and the different ways their families cope, is not the easiest watch. But I'm always ready for a creepy thriller, especially one that features Jake Gyllenhaal and this one is beautifully shot by Roger Deakins.  Hugh Jackman leaves his Wolverine Muttonchops on the makeup stand for a while to portray the proactive father of one of the missing girls and while the entire cast is spot-on, it's the twists and turns that are the heart of this movie.  In a world full of predictability, I found this to be a more interesting ride than I bargained for.  It's terrifying and dark, mostly because of its plausibility, but it feels like a hidden gem in a year that was full of some very good films, and some very over-hyped films.",

            "content": "Prisoners (Denis Villeneuve, 2013)\n\nI'll be up front with you: I am writing the first sentences of this review, which I expect will be a very long one, without knowing what rating I will actually be giving Prisoners. I believe that somewhere over the course of the thousands of reviews I have written (Amazon is home to over six thousand of them as of this writing, on October 5, 2013, and I had been reviewing steadily for longer before I started posting there than I have been since I started, so you can do the math...) that has probably happened before...but I can't remember it, if it has. I have a great deal to mull over before figuring that out, I think. I liked it, overall; there is a great deal to like about it. It is surprisingly well-paced for having come out of a film culture where directors are actively encouraged to make their films about half as long as this one (this is the only film I have seen made in the last fifteen years that is this long that is not either (a) a musical, (b) a Shah Rukh Khan vehicle, or (c ) both of the above), it is unflinching in its examination of violence, its script is intelligent and multi-layered (though it does overplay its hand now and again), it is impeccably-cast, and I could keep going like this all night without really digging into the film at all. But it is not perfect, and while I admit I finished watching it less than an hour and a half before I am writing the opening words of this review, the more I think about the nagging questions I walked out of the theater with, the more they nag at me. Time will tell (and probably will, before I finish writing this review, which will probably be a few weeks from now-if I follow standard operating procedure with it, anyway) if they continue to nag, but the biggest thing that bothered me, and my first impression is that much of this comes from Jake Gyllenhaal being one of the male leads, is that I saw a lot of Zodiac in this movie. I also saw a lot of Snowtown, which is harder to explain away. That made some of what unfolded on the screen before me more predictable than, I think, it should have been; almost certainly more than screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) intended. But we shall see after I keep mulling it over; I'm going to go do some more of that right now.\n\nPlot: Keller Dover (X-Men's Hugh Jackman) and Frankin Burch (Hustle and Flow's Terrence Howard) are friends in the suburbs. They get together for Thanksgiving; their daughters go out, saying they're heading over to the other house to do whatever it is that preteen girls do away form the prying eyes of their parents. They never make it. Suspicion is immediately cast on a broken-down old camper that has been seen in the area; when the police track it down in the dark corner of a convenience store parking lot, they find its driver to be young mentally-challenged Alex Jones (The Good Heart's Paul Dano). The police, in the form of one Detective Loki (The Day After Tomorrow's Jake Gyllenhaal), interrogate Jones, but do not have enough evidence to go anywhere with it; he is ultimately released, leading Dover to take matters into his own hands. Initially, Burch goes along with Dover's plan for extracting information, but the longer things go one, the more Dover pulls away not only from Burch, but from the rest of his life. Eventually, people start noticing that Alex has gone missing, and Detective Loki's focus hones in on Dover.\n\nAnd now back to my initial paragraph, which I wrote five months before this one. About 80% of this movie is phenomenal, a thought-provoking journey into the motivations and actions of people who are driven to desperation. The other 20% feels as if it were tacked on for a commercial audience who would not be satisfied with that and needed some sort of conventional mystery to resolve. It's trite, relies on plot twists you've seen in half a hundred other movies of its ilk, and while it is as well-presented as the rest of the movie-these are all fine actors turning in fine performances, Villeneuve (Incendies) certainly knows his way around a camera, and  Roger Deakins was nominated for an Oscar for his chilling cinematography (he lost to, of course, Gravity)-it still feels kind of like the old Irving Pichel trick of \"hey, we finished shooting a week early and have some extra stock, let's make another movie!\"...except this time they stitched the two together, and the graft didn't quite take. The straight mystery at the end is watchable, but in juxtaposition to the drama/thriller/horror film that comes before it, it pales. Should you see it? Absolutely. Is it, as IMDB would have us believe as I am writing this in March 2014, one of the 250 best movies ever made (it is sitting at #249)? Not on your life. ***  1/2",

            "content": "Kidnapping is one of the most terrifying experiences any parent can go through. For this reason, 'Prisoners' has got to be one of the most depressing, conflicted films in recent memory. Two families nightmares become reality on Thanksgiving Day when their young daughters disappear in broad daylight. The ensuing pursuit led by the understandably enraged fathers Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and their defeated wives (played by Maria Bello and Viola Davis) is dramatic, uncomfortable and shocking. There are so many twists and turns throughout this film, it's hard to say which way is up. Quickly, the focus shifts to Alex Jones, a slow young man who was driving his RV around the families' neighborhood when the girls disappeared, and Keller becomes obsessed with interrogating him after he's released due to a lack of evidence. Also integral to 'Prisoners' is detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), who does his best to please Keller but is equally dedicated to following protocol and relying on his perfect record of rescuing kidnapping victims. The friction that develops between Keller and Loki is top-notch. There is also a clear theme of religion throughout 'Prisoners,' with Keller's devout Catholicism and the loss of faith recounted by Alex's aunt, Holly Jones (portrayed brilliantly by Melissa Leo). Still, there are plenty of areas for criticism of 'Prisoners,' including its runtime and the unsettling scenes of torture carried out by Keller. For this reason, he loses most of the sympathy his character had at the outset of the film, although there is an underlying sense of pity towards his character throughout the film. Much has been made of the final scene of the film, but it is a very fitting way to end such tumultuous story. While 'Prisoners' puts the grit in gritty, it is a powerful film that will remain with you long after you watch it.",

That may not seem to match a 4 1/2 star rating but the relief came because now I could reflect on the movie and not endure more subjection of mystery, horror, and pure villainy. One thing is clear, the evil in this story DOES change the good people on the other side of the board. Just as in our world, evil affects us in many ways seen and unseen, despite our best beliefs that we have everything under control. Villeneuve's choices in direction, scene play, and character exploration, supported by Aaron Guzikowski's fantastic script, act as a boxer who has you pinned in the ring as he hammers at your skull and chest. You can't escape or deny the images playing out in front of you. You feel yourself in the characters and you steadily begin to relate to Jackman's descent, Gyllenhaal's determination, and Howard's indecision. This is where Prisoners offers its best. It's not in the premise of two kidnapped daughters, it's in the reasons behind why people do what they do because they've been cheated, hurt, abused, and forgotten. Melissa Leo pulls a bag over your eyes then proceeds to tell you what you see. The film reaches into depths that many would leave unanswered for fear of finding what's there. Questions of how far is too far, what is necessary, and where does wrong become right and vice versa are just the beginning in one of the toughest movies I've ever watched.

Gyllenhaal plays a dogged detective with a seemingly mild case of tourrette's (he blinks his eyes oddly and excessively).  The tale is laid out like a maze. Nothing connects in straight lines. Jackman's role as the recovered alcoholic dad who has a gut feeling he's found a suspect, and his brutality as a result of this, are a bit much, but the rest of the characters, action and screenplay are tight and amazingly executed.

            "content": "An incredibly ambitious movie that is only, slightly, undone by its sprawling length and fairly predictable \"twist\" in the third act of the story.  This film isn't afraid to ask some really tough and disturbing questions, but it also has the strength to face them head on and not shy away from anything because it might be considered a sensitive subject.  The film is definitely morally complex and there's no one simple answer to the questions the film makes the audience ask.  I think that's the film's biggest positive, the fact that it doesn't shy away from the disturbing aspects of its story.  If I was put into this same situation that Keller found himself in, I don't think I'd have the heart to do what he did, even if I was a parent.  Because there's still that doubt, which Keller never had, that maybe Alex wasn't involved in the things he was accused of.  I'm gonna try my best not to spoil the film, but if I do I'll put a warning beforehand.  The things that Keller did, in his own mind, were justified because of the fact that he was doing his absolute best to get his daughter back.  Almost killing another human being, that may not have been involved, be damned.  That's the debate that the film is trying to bring up, would someone, in this same situation, have the guts to torture another human being for information he may not even be privy to.  As someone that doesn't have children, it'd be easy for me to say no at this moment in my life.  But the fact of the matter is that, at this moment, I can't see myself putting another human being through torturous hell.  Who am I to do that?  I've no right, especially when there's that doubt in your mind that maybe this person is innocent.  If I had 100% proof that this person did it, without a shadow of a doubt, I wouldn't have a problem with it.  But even if you're 99.9% sure, there's still that tiny chance that this person is innocent.  The fact that you'd have to live with that for the rest of your life.  That's gonna haunt you forever.  And even more so when what Keller did was done to someone that was a victim himself, he was a victim of the same people that kidnapped his daughter.  And this will be SPOILER-HEAVY...so skip ahead until I say.  Alex was already traumatized by the experience of being kidnapped at such a young age and being raised by the people that took him, to the point that Alex was no more than 10 years old when it came to mental age.  On top of that you have Keller beating him until his face is barely recognizable and being held hostage in the shower, where Keller would occasionally turn the shower on, from the outside, and have scalding hot water come out and burn the poor kid.  Alex will never be the same again.  By the end of the film, he's returned to his family but it's only obvious that he will never have a normal life again.  It's obvious that his family will have to suffer from the effects of the kidnapping and the abuse Keller put him through.  Keller's actions created waves that will ripple throughout the rest of Alex's life.  I don't think that's something the film really focuses on that much.  Yea, they do bring up that Keller, if found, would go to jail for what he did, but the consequences of his actions aren't fully explored.  The other interesting thing the film brings up is the fact that, whether you agree with his methods or not, Keller's actions, regardless of Alex's innocence or not, did, in fact, lead him to saving his daughter.  He doesn't save her directly, but if he hadn't tortured Alex, Loki wouldn't have found him and he wouldn't have been told by his boss to tell Alex's aunt of what happened to him, then he wouldn't have seen Alex's aunt drugging Anna, Keller's daughter, and he wouldn't have saved her.  Again, Keller indirectly saved his own daughter.  He wouldn't have been able to do this had he not tortured poor Alex.  So it raises some interesting moral conundrums.  There's no easy answer to the questions the film raises, but the film is smart enough to let you make up your own mind rather than shoving an agenda down your throat.  That's about it with the SPOILERS.  Like I said at the beginning, I did have a problem with the third act and how it became too much like a stereotypical suspense/thriller and its too long at times.  But the film benefits from a great cast, an incredible cast with one of Hugh Jackman's best performances, if not his best, and some beautiful cinematography.  So I think that makes the film easier to watch.  I don't think the film should've been cut down by much but 130 minutes would've been a perfect running length for this movie.  Regardless of that, this is still an incredible film that's definitely a very disturbing watch and it's definitely a film that's gonna haunt you long after you're done with it.",

He's a decent, God-fearing man in the beginning and this horrible nightmare of a situation brings out the animal within. A sort of interesting look at the nature of man when we are pushed to our absolute limits and desperation. Paul Dano will probably be typecast forever as \"creepy freak\".",

            "content": "Let me start by simply saying this: if you have small children, do me a favor and do not watch this movie! As a man with no children even I was harshly affected by things that are depicted in this movie, to the point where it almost kept me up at night. Child abduction is a sad reality in our world, and I have little doubt that most parents would say they would do anything to get their kids back in that situation. What Prisoners accomplishes is putting that belief to the test...how far are you really willing to go? It seriously makes you think, and at some point you become introspective and start to wonder where you draw the line between right and wrong. That's a remarkable reaction to have when all you're doing is watching a movie. This movie is dark, bleak, and even when something positive happens you find yourself conflicted. There is no clear protagonist or antagonist for most of the film, because it shies away from black & white and takes place almost entirely in the grey. Ordinarily I'd hate that kind of ambiguity, but here it works. \n\nIf you thought Hugh Jackman was intimidating as Wolverine you haven't seen anything yet. His portrayal of Keller is convincingly ruthless. I really believed that he was someone desperately trying to hang onto his sanity, as he fears letting his whole family down by losing his own daughter. Jake Gyllenhaal probably has the easiest role to play, because he seems to be the most level-headed of the characters. Naturally, being a police officer working the case, he has the benefit of not having as strong an emotional investment in the abductions. Yet you see him boil over occasionally as he is clearly impacted by the time spent with grieving families. I was impressed with Paul Dano's performance as a potential suspect. While he didn't have to say much, he did a great job of giving curious looks that kept you wondering whether he was hiding more than it appeared. But, for me, the best performances in Prisoners came from Terrence Howard and Viola Davis. As the parents of the other abductee they gave the viewers a relatable presence and helped ask the questions that you as a viewer were asking as well. Sadly they all but disappear in the second half of the film, which is my primary complaint.\n\nIn the first half of the movie I was so impressed with what they were doing. Although it was very violent, it wasn't gore just for the sake of gore like the Saw films. Instead it was driving the viewer to dark places and led me to question where I would morally draw the line. Do you at some point become the very evil that you seek to eliminate? That's where Terrence Howard and Viola Davis came in so handy, because they vocalized what I was feeling. This was so harsh that it was almost painful watching, but I couldn't look away because it was so well done. Yet somewhere about halfway through the film the entire story shifted gears. Suddenly it was running away from that moral debate, and into a by-the-books murder mystery. Now it is a high quality murder mystery, not a reject episode of CSI or something. It's just kind of disappointing that they changed focus so much. Even if they really wanted to switch themes it would have been nice if they gave a proper resolution to the dark road the first half led us down. No matter what Prisoners was a quality film that impacted me quite a bit. It was hard to watch, and I'm not going to seek it out again, but I'm glad I saw it.",

Leading the investigation is Detective David Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal who after arresting the driver is on the search but knowing that Keller's daughter Anna's life is at stake, he himself takes matters into his own hands as a maniac is waging a war against god by killing numerous children. The movie itself basically asks you about how far would you go to protect your children. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal were an unusual duo for the movie but they fit together very well. I haven't seen Jake in a movie for a long time which is why I wanted to watch this film badly and he was as good as always. Prisoners  gets a solid 8.5/10.",

It was also interesting how the fathers attempt to take matters into their own hands, but ultimately make things worse for themselves; whilst interestingly justifying the title of the film. The two leads portray their characters well; particularly Gyllenhaal.\n\nDespite its considerable length, the film itself did not seem to drag, instead remaining intense and interesting. Whilst each of the components to the case were infact intelligent, the ending left me somewhat disappointed. Many questions were left unanswered, with character links hard to define. A reliance on weak psychological reasoning  for the crime was also unsatisfactory. Of course this may have all been intended, but the links that were provided did seem somewhat desperate, making me want to give the director of the film a call to answer a couple of queries. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed this crime thriller, just falling short of 4 stars due to the question provoking ending.",

I did have to watch it in 2 parts the length of the film, at 2 and a half hours, was quite much to keep up with, in that mood. There's loads of twists and turns throughout the movie which keeps it interesting, and the acting from all of the cast was great. The director should have shown some more of the other family that is also going through hell and the ending was left up to the audience to put together, which was a bit weird after getting drawn into the families trauma. The storyline is very well put together and it really does make the audience feel that they are going through the situation with the characters. In all its a great watch but it's quite long. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nHugh Jackman really does show a different side to his usual acting style. If it wasn't for his in depth performance, this movie wouldn't have been half as good. All of the other characters also bring reality to the film which makes the intensity throughout the movie a great watch. Although the film is quite long, I don't think that I would take anything out of the movie. It does flow well and the director really did cover every aspect of a bad situation that every is going through. I don't think that I would have gone with that type of ending, but in all, it's entertaining and enjoyable.\n\nBudget: $46million\nWorldwide Gross: $123million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there deep dramas and kidnap and murder. 7/10",

Prisoners is a film about two families who both of their daughters get kidnapped and both of the families with the help of the police, investigate and look for their daughters. This is a very dark, grim, and at times is a hard film to sit through. That being said, I have created a PainOmeter scale out of five (five being the worst) to inform you guys if you simply cannot take very violent and painful scenes. This will be addressed along will the film's final score. I loved this film! Hugh Jackman plays Anna's father and is the protagonist of the film. You can see how Jackman really loses his rag and does a great job as Keller Dover. There is one scene that involves Jackman doing something that I won't spoil but you will notice it and go WOW! The story is also very thought provoking and will keep you on the edge of your seat because of the direction and character building involved with this movie. Also Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones, is this weird adult with the IQ of a ten year old and is the main suspect of the investigation. I thought he nailed just the right tone of the character and was hard to \"look at\" at times. My favorite part of the film was surprisingly Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the detective looking for the missing girls. Gyllenhaal still plays the role of a cop very well after all of that training for End Of Watch. Another great part of the film is that it manages to never take a rest on character building and story development. I hate when films give you time to take a break then start all over again and this film really avoids that entirely. I really have no problems with the film except for the runtime. Even though this was a great movie I just couldn't go for a perfect  5.   4 Stars 1-30-14",

That said, it's a little muddled and overlong, but plays out pretty well.  Hugh Jackman (The Wolverine) gives a convincing performance - one that rightly put him in early Oscar buzz, before the art house flicks took over.  It's one of those movies that's chock full of capable actors, but some shine more than others.  I still don't see the appeal of Jake Gyllenhaal (End of Watch), but he's apt in this flick. Viola Davis (Beautiful Creatures) and Mario Bello (Grown Ups 2) shine, Terrance Howard (Lee Daniel's The Butler) turns in his best performance in some time, Paul Dano (Looper) is predictably apt yet strange, and Melissa Leo (Olympus Has Fallen) continues to impress.  Honestly, next to Jackman, she's the standout of the picture.  It's pretty dark, but it's also well-acted, well-paced, and fulfilling enough that it doesn't fit the typical Oscar mold.",

After the daughters of both families vanish, things take a darker turn when there is belief that they were probably abducted. Hugh Jackman gives a chilling and dark turn as Keller Dover, a religious man who is brought to his breaking point after he feels that the police haven't done their job properly, while Jake Gyllenhaal gives a terrific supporting performance as Detective Loki, who stops at nothing to find the children and their kidnapper. The supporting actors are also terrific, such as Terence Howard as a grieving father and Viola Davis as his grieving wife, Maria Bello as Jackman's drunken wife, Paul Dano as the supposed timid kidnapper and Melissa Leo as Dano's aunt. Roger Deakins' cinematography is bleak and wonderfully supports the film's plot, while Denis Villeneuve's direction is flawless and the script by Aaron Guzikowski is haunting. Throughout the entire film you side with Jackman, while the film takes several terrific twists leading up to a surprising ending. Bravo.",

Especially the night scenes and rainy highways look stunning. The film also has atmospheric sound design. The rhythm of the movie is delightfully calm and peaceful, and I think that makes the characters and the story feel real.

For this reason the movie went buy rather quickly even though it is certainly longer than the average. I thought the acting was done very well. Hugh Jackman does a better job than I thought playing the father figure, but he really shines when he has to play the tough guy father figure. Jake Gyllenhaal does an equally good job portraying a detective that is put in a difficult situation that creates a tension between the law and moral obligations. I realize that this is R-rated, but I feel it is important to note this movie does have some rather violent and disturbing material. I was even surprised by some of it.

            "content": "Even before I saw the suspenseful and mysterious drama Prisoners, I thought the movie was extremely undersold for a film starring two Oscar-nominated actors as great as Hugh Jackman & Jake Gyllenhaal and directed by Oscar-nominee Denis Villeneuve.  After seeing it, it's definitely surprising how it has stayed under the radar this long.  Villeneuve has created a dark and edgy feel that keeps you uneasy while pulling at your heart to ache for the friends and family of missing persons in general.  Somehow the story struck me as horrific and unbelievable while still lying in the realm of possibility.  \n\tHugh Jackman plays a role I've never seen him attempt and one I think might be different than any he's every played before.  As the father of a six-year-old girl who goes missing with her young friend, Keller Dover (Jackman) makes a very convincing frantic parent.  Having to act out every mother and father's worst nightmare can't be an easy task and Jackman left me impressed, as always.  \n\t  Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) quickly locates an old RV that had been spotted down the street prior to the girls disappearance and arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano).  Although he is the lone suspect and plenty suspicious, a lack of evidence requires them to release him.  Desperate and knowing he's running out of time, Dover loses faith in Detective Loki and has no choice but to take the situation into his own hands.  \n\tOverall, I felt the acting was impeccable.  Terrence Howard joins Jackman and Gyllenhaal as the father of the second missing girl and sheds different light on how one might react when faced with the same horrendous situation.  I was fairly engaged throughout the entire 155 minute movie.  Usually, I don't see a need for films like this to be quite as long, but in this case Villeneuve did an outstanding job of holding my attention and intrigue.  If there is one thing I could say about this movie that bothered me, it might be the ending.  Although it didn't ruin the film in any way, it did feel like a bit of a cop-out.  Without giving away too much, it definitely has a bit of a cliff-hanger ending.  \nThis film is not for the overly sensitive, weak stomached, or faint-of-heart.  It is the type of movie that leaves you truly contemplating how far you would go to save those that are most important to you.",

And when considering that the academy of motion picture arts only nominated it for best cinematography, it is also one of the most underrated! Prisoners deserved at least half of the available nominations, including Hugh Jackman for Best Actor (his best performance yet I think), Jake Gyllenhaal and Terrance Howard for Best Supporting Actors, Melissa Leo and Viola Davis for Best Supporting Actresses, Denis Villeneuve for Best Director, Aaron Guzikowski for Best Original Screenplay, and of course, Best Cinematography for Roger Deakins. But the real star hear, besides Hugh Jackman of course, is Paul Dano. Paul delivered the most powerful performance in a movie filled with equally powerful actors and their own performances. I thought that if Prisoners was to be nominated for anything it would be for Paul Dano's disturbing portrayal as the mentally challenged suspect. \n\nThe more I sit and think about the nominating process for the Oscars, the more I come to realize that they are all a bunch of hypocritical old schoolers who relish in snubbing actors and directors and giving them to people who are far less deserving, I.e. Shakespeare in Love over Saving Private Ryan? Chicago over Gangs of New York? Forest Gump over Pulp Fiction? What Were They Thinking! That last one is a little unfair because Tom Hanks deserved that Oscar, but Pulp Fiction was clearly the better film. \n\nIf you have an ounce of respect for the art of cinema, or if you just love movies in general, you will do yourself a favor and see this movie. It is living proof that the academy of motion picture arts and sciences is one big joke! Another one to look at is Captain Phillips. Another great performance from another great actor, Tom Hanks, that was snubbed big time!",

While all actors do great in bringing the sentiment of anxiety and lack of safety to the viewer  the real surprise is the performance of Hugh Jackman. Probably one of the most likeable characters in modern cinema Jackman manages to come across as a torn human being, forced to do unspeakable acts of violence in order to save the ones he loves. \n  The movie simply absorbs you in its cold, complicated story, even though it can get a bit too loaded and too complicated to follow.  At the end of the mystery, when everything seems to be unwrapped and solved the last frames leave a continuous shiver down your spine and makes you feel genuine fear, and that is not a bad thing.",

After seeing this, I will say that he has acting range! Since LMS I've always thought he's one of the most underused and under appreciated actors.

I was still curious how it would end, but I got the bigger part of the twist.\n\n***SPOILER ALERT***\nI defiantly did not enjoy watching a mentally disabled man get beaten and tortured.

If you're expecting a good time or to come out with a smile on your face, this is not your type of movie. You would be much better off popping in something like Pacific Rim or seeing if Frozen is still playing where you live. But even if a film is horribly depressing, that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it if given the chance. Far from it with something like Prisoners, the English language debut of Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies). While its grueling content and odd plot points may cause some contention with viewers, Prisoners delivers on damn near every cylinder you should expect to see in a good mystery: Excellent performances, a plot that keeps you guessing till the very end, haunting cinematography and some interesting debates on morality and what one would do and how far they would go to save a loved one.\n\nOne day, somewhere in Pennsylvania, a small get together with two families is going on. Set sometime around Thanksgiving, the two families The Dovers (Hugh Jackman playing Keller and Maria Bello playing Grace) and The Birches (Viola Davis playing Nacy and Terrence Howard playing Franklin) are having a nice get together. Everybody's laughing, chowing down tasty food, just having a good time together. The teens hang out while the youngsters, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, are off playing around in the neighborhood. \n\nA few hours latter, the two youngest disappear. An investigation is soon kicked into motion and headed by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to find out who it is Eventually, the find a suspect in the form of mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Paul Dano). But due to the fact there is a lack of evidence on whether he did it or not, he winds up being released. The father of one of the families, Keller Dover, however, becomes increasingly unstable over the course of the investigation, resorting to his own (brutal) methods to find out if Alex actually did it or not.\n\nSo yes, as one can tell from that synopsis up top, Prisoners isn't what one would call a \"feel good movie\". On top of that, it isn't one that goes by quick. It fully expects you to sit down and watch as it takes you on a long journey of what its like to have a child taken from you. Whether you have or haven't had kids, you feel steeped in the misery and horror of what the parents go through in the film. Hell, the film was originally slapped with an NC-17 rating before it got re-edited with a R. Frankly, after watching the film itself, it doesn't surprise me that it almost got the former.\n\nAnother interesting note to make is that in addition to being a Drama-Mystery-Thriller, the film is also a play on morality. Most of the characters never stay clean for long, especially High Jackman's character, who pulls some especially dickish things to find his kid. As seen in the trailers (don't worry; this all happens in the first half hour), he winds up kidnapping Alex to find out where the children are, but what he does will make your stomach churn. Even as the film went as on, I found myself conflicted with his character, wanting him to find his kids but I wished he'd stop being such an ass in trying to find his kid. The film itself and its characters are even asking themselves if what they're doing is justified or not.\n\nWhat I found interesting about the film is that you never really know who's who or what till the end. For the majority of the film's running time, it keeps you guessing on whether Alex did it or not. Is he playing stupid? Does he genuinely not know what happened to the kids? Was he manipulated into doing what he did? It's like being in a maze, a nightmarish labyrinth from where there is no escape from until the very end.\n\nThe film's performances are uniformly excellent, with Hugh Jackman showing us a scary side of his acting abilities that we haven't seen before. His character shows a broad range of anger, ruthlessness and regret. The performance as Dover is so good, it outright makes his iconic Wolverine role look downright pathetic by comparison. I can also safely say that thanks to this role, Jackman's was able to partially redeem himself after being in last year's blunderpiece Movie 43. He's not quite there yet, but I hold him in much higher regard than I did after 43. The rest of the supporting cast also give great performances as well. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to be one of the best actors working today, with an almost equally compelling side role as the determined Detective Loki. One scene in particular that stands out for me with him is when flips out in his office. I won't say what happens in regards to that part in what triggers him, but damn, he really lost it in a big way.\n\nTerrence Howard and Paul Dano bring their goods to the table as well, as does Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Melissa Leo also shows up as Alex Jones' mother, Holly, and while she doesn't have that many scenes in the film, she is compelling enough to keep an admirable presence on-screen. Even the kids who play Joy and Anna (Kyla Drew Simmons and Erin Gerasimovich, respectively) do their roles without some kind of saccharine or sickly-sweet kind of way that one would usually expect from kids in movies.\n\nShot by famous cinematographer Roger Deakins (Skyfall, No Country For Old Men, The Shawshank Redemption), Prisoners looks unsurprisingly beautiful in its imagery. Damn near every frame looks downright perfect, with scenes that look like they were molded by a paint brush than a camera. Denis and Deakins obviously know what they're doing, and I hope that they collaborate more in the future. Then there's the score by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson, who achieves haunting yet minimalist work that help establish the mood of the picture quite excellently.\n\nIf there were any problems I had with the film, I'd say it would be some plot elements. There's something that happens to Paul Dano's character in which he ends up disappearing from the public eye and it doesn't really get addressed until the last 30 minutes of the movie. Arguably, due to the investigation of the girls, I can see how their disappearance could be held in higher regard than Dano's but it was still a little something that bothered me.\n\nThen there's how the film handles its clues, foreshadowing and red-herrings, in which it maybe just a little too clever for its own good. It's great to see a film keep its audience guessing all the way through and then pull the rug under their feet when they least expect it, but it felt like the movie was getting a little overly complicated. Not that it was a major hindrance to the film's quality, but I can see how some would be fed up with the plot twists and the loopty loops the film pulls from time to time.\n\nIt's a shame that the film was missed at the Oscar season. It was a big contender in the first couple of weeks it came out but due to being swarmed by a mountain of other films (Gravity, 12 Years A Slave, The Wolf of Wall Street), it sadly got overlooked and wound up with only a nom for Best Cinematography. Yet, in spite of that, its more than worth checking out. Its imagery, performances and plot won't leave you for a while and it will keep you engaged all the way through its long running time.",

            "content": "Prisoners is one of the better reviewed films of 2013 that failed to be mentioned by a number of critic groups and/or various guilds throughout the Award Season of Hollywood after all was said-and-done.  The movie - from Oscar-nominated Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies [2010]) - earned critical praise upon its initial release in the fall of last year as did its large and respected ensemble cast.  Cast members Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal both had Oscar-talk circulating about them and the consensus on Jackman was that it was perhaps his best performance to date which was remarkable as the actor had just earned his first Oscar nomination the year prior for Les Mis\u00e9rables!  As I watched Prisoners, I found myself agreeing with much of the critical praise it had received and found it to be one of those rare acclaimed films that \"the masses\" (us!) and critics could both agree upon!  It is a gripping and engrossing, heavily dramatic psychological thriller about good guys and bad guys ... but mostly about those who inhabit the gray areas in between.  When two six-year-old girls of two married couples - Jackman/Maria Bello (The Cooler) and Viola Davis (Doubt)/Terrence Howard (Hustle & Flow) - go missing, all fingers point to the perversely pleased local simpleton Alex Jones(Paul Dano - 12 Years a Slave) whose cooperative aunt (Melissa Leo - Frozen River) believes him to be innocent although she knows he is a troubled soul.  When the local PD (Gyllenhaal) runs into dead-ends and Jones is released for lack of evidence, the desperate fathers do what desperate fathers will do to find their missing daughters.  Jackman becomes a self-righteous judge and jury via a frighteningly easy transformation but he still needs to find the girls.  The film asks tough and disturbing questions (with some ghastly images) an audience might not want to hear or consider and the film is a bit long (2.5 hours); but I believe it to be so morally confounding one cannot quit it.",

            "content": "No Spoilers until marked.\n\nThis movie represents some of the best acting, and tightest plot spinning I have ever seen on screen! Prepare yourself for a very emotional, suspenseful, anxiety ridden maze-like trip through a parent's worst nightmare- this movie hits home hard for those of us with children but it's breathtaking raw emotion, keep-you-guessing type plot, and fantastic acting makes it well worth the heartache.\n\nThe acting is fantastic all around but Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, and Paul Dano steal the show! By the end of the movie, I was left especially hungry to learn more about Gyllenhaal's \"Detective Loki.\" The details of his character are incredibly interesting and fitting for his role. Jackman was intense... and I do mean INTENSE. His visceral desperation and anger are felt more than just seen. And Dano brings something to the screen that I have never before seen. We are told he is a mentally disadvantaged man with an intellect no greater than a ten year old and the way this plays out on screen is just brilliant. I'll leave it at that for this non-spoiler part of the review. The rest of the cast does very well also, particularly Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as Franklin and Nancy Birch though the movie does not center around their characters quite as much.\n\nThe cinematography was brilliant. There were some scenes that could easily have been movie posters, I won't spoil them for you. Overall the movie was beautifully shot.\n\nAs far as music and sound go, I have to say I don't remember any of the music from the film. This is not necessarily a bad thing as I would prefer it not be memorable in a bad way so as to distract from what is being portrayed but it also means that it wasn't amazing. The sound, however, is a different story. There were moments of complete silence in the movie where the silence itself was a sound effect. There were intense moments that were accented by incredibly clear and poignant sound that fit the scene.\n\nPlot, oh boy was there plot! A great, edge of the seat, thrilling plot that just smacked me in the face every couple of minutes! The movie goes on for about 2.5 hours and the whole time I was glued to the screen. What an incredible story!\n\n********WARNING: HUGE SPOILERS BELOW, don't read any further unless you have seen the movie or for some reason just want to destroy the experience of watching this film for yourself.\n*************************************************************************************************************************************\nOk, just so we are all on the same page, I am going to go through the plot and piece things together since there seems to be a bit of confusion on Who Bobby Taylor was, how joy escaped, and what the Leo's were actually doing to children.\n\nWe start off being introduced to Keller Dover and his son , Ralph. Keller recites the Lord's Prayer and his son lines up a shot for a deer. This scene is blatantly metaphorical for \"doing what is necessary\" in Keller's perspective. It also shows how Ralph is becoming a man. This plays well against Alex Jones because it shows you what Alex never had and why he isn't a \"man\" but rather still a 10 year old boy. (Obviously abuse and drugs/snake venom had something to do with it too). This is how Keller works, he doesn't enjoy killing the deer but it is necessary to him and the ends justify the means. The prayer shows us that he doesn't \"shoot the deer\" for his own enjoyment, it is a means by which he can get what he needs for his family. This foreshadows the exact sentiment felt when he tortures Alex.\n\nWe can now skip ahead to the children disappearing. We meet Detective Loki. He has tattoos but he hides them constantly. He clasps his hands to hide his knuckle tattoos and he buttons his shirt to the top button to hide his neck tattoos. He wears a masonic ring, His tattoos and his opening lines indicate that he has an interest in Zodiac signs and astrology- all information we are given throughout the film indicates that he had a rough past and was possibly a criminal turned cop. Loki is a prisoner of his past.\n\nKeller becomes a prisoner to his desperation, doing things he would never have done under normal circumstances, likewise his wife becomes a prisoner to her medication as a way of dealing with the tragedy of losing her daughter. Ralph becomes a prisoner of the house, his father the jailor. He is told to watch over his mother and stay home. Alex becomes Keller's prisoner in a very literal sense. The children are obviously prisoners- I could go on. Everyone in the movie is a prisoner to something by this point.\n\nThe RV is gone over CSI-Miami style and nothing is found- this is because Alex merely let the kids in, let them play and sing while he drove them to his \"aunt's\" house. This is what he meant when he said \"They didn't cry until I left them.\" It also explains Ms. Leo's later comment that he only played with the children. Loki continues tracking down leads by visiting local sex offenders and happens upon a body in the creepy as f*** basement/crawl-space/nightmare-dungeon under the Priest's house. This body is wearing a necklace with a circular maze etched on it, hmmmmm. It is also explained that the man has kidnapped and killed at least 16 children. This man is Ms. Leo's husband that she said disappeared after a fight. He is also the \"invisible man\" that the book in Bobby Taylor's house is about.\n\nSpeaking of Bobby Taylor, aka \"The Snake Guy,\" he was a former abductee, taken by the Leo's when he was just a boy. He escaped somehow, it isn't ever explained, but he is now damaged and seeks to recreate the efforts of his captors to try and understand their motives. He is obsessed with it, going as far as stealing abducted children's clothes, spattering them with pigs blood and claiming to have killed them. He buries child-manikins in his yard after bashing in their heads. He is a mixture of a victim with Stockholm syndrome, a child, and a copycat killer. He too, is a prisoner to his past, he even goes so far as to wear the same jacket as Ms. Leo does (more on that later).\n\nSo the Leo's have had a process that is now continued only by Ms. Leo since Mr. Leo is dead. By the end of the movie, we should be able to conclude that The Leo's had a son who died of cancer. They were religious prior to this and afterward, unable to reconcile the tragedy with their religion, they reject their religion and begin to \"wage war on god\" by abducting other people's children, creating \"demons\" aka the broken, parents of the abducted children. They do this alone at first and later by having Alex find and pick up children. The children are then delivered to the Leo's house where they are given Kool-Aid laced with ketamine and LCD and told that they can leave when they have solved a book fool of mazes. The catch is, the last maze, the same one that Mr. Leo wore around his neck, is unsolvable. Eventually the children are injected with snake venom and buried. This is exactly what happened to Joy and Anna but Joy was able to get away before she was injected. (Some might argue that there is a different order to it but this is the gist. All these things happen, it may be done in a different order depending on the kid)\n\nHow did Joy get away? The movie tells you but it is a bit difficult to piece it together. We see Joy's flash backs when she is in the hospital room and it shows a person wearing a jacket carrying Anna in the right arm and reaching for Joy (who is running away) with her left. It also shows two bottles of the laced Kool-Aid, one full and one half empty. We can deduce that it was Ms. Leo in the Jacket, and that Joy did not drink her Kool-Aid. This fits with what Ms. Leo said about having to move the girls inside after Detective Loki was snooping around the car outside. Thus when Ms. Leo was moving them inside, Joy ran away and was picked up by a passing motorist.\n\nAll this is pieced together when Keller visits Joy in the hospital and she says \"You were there. She put tape on our mouths!\" Keller thinks back and realizes the only place he has gone where there was a female suspect was the Leo's home. Joy must have heard his voice through the thin walls. He gains entry by half-heartedly pretending to offer assistance fixing up the house and ignores the obviously hidden weapon in her hand. This is the only part of the plot that made me cringe. We all knew she had a gun, and Keller should have too.\n\nSo he gets drugged, shot, and thrown in the pit- Loki finds Alex in Keller's old apartment building, in pretty bad shape assumingly. He is tasked with telling Ms. Leo they found Alex. Detective Loki lets himself in, finds Ms. Leo injecting Anna with venom and a firefight ensues, in which Loki gets grazed on the head and Ms. Leo gets gunned down. The scene where Loki drives Anna to the hospital was amazing. The lighting, the blurry eyes, the rain, the anxiety... MAN! PERFECT!\n\nThe end of the movie wraps up pretty neatly. Loki hears Keller blowing the whistle and we know that he finds Keller, and we know that Keller goes to Jail (based on previous comments made by Loki in the hospital).\n\nThis movie used the maze as a theme constantly. Think about how you would solve a maze on a piece of paper, following one trail until it dead ends and having to backtrack and pick a different branch, sometimes overlooking the right path until it is the only one left. That is how the plot played out, that is how each prisoner felt inside their prison. Beautiful.",

            "content": "\"Prisoners\" is totally messed up.  This shocking story of abduction, devastation, and brutal torture contains several mysteries that all tie together in the end.  Its content seems like it belongs in a late-summer thriller but it works well in this Oscar-caliber drama.  The script is well written, introducing important facts at all of the right times, making you think that you have it all figured out, and then keeping you (and all of the characters) guessing until the very end.  I found an internal battle forming within myself as I didn't want Paul Dano to be guilty but hoped that he was simply so that I wouldn't feel bad about him enduring all of that torture.  Dano is an underrated actor with impressive roles in \"Being Flynn,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" and \"Ruby Sparks\" on his resume.  It may seem like he does not do much acting as Alex Jones but playing a role that communicates through body language instead of spoken dialogue requires a refined skill.  Hugh Jackman is good but sometimes it just felt like we needed a break from his overwhelming amount of anger.  The supporting roles are the most impressive as Maria Bello creates some nice emotional moments when the depression overwhelms her and she becomes dependant on pills to keep her numb.  Plus Terrence Howard and Viola Davis bring another dynamic to the torture scenes as they take on the \"good cop\" roles.  The real feature in this film is Melissa Leo, nearly unrecognizable as Holly Jones who progressively reveals layers of her life throughout the film.  You'll never see the end coming although you'll want to see the end of the torture arrive much earlier than it does.  There is something twisted about \"Prisons\" but that might be what makes the film so dreadfully attractive.",

But the writing is simply not all there to make the transition from beginning to end work as well as it could have with just a little more evidence spread throughout to make it more of a crime thriller.\n\nAs an aside, I also felt that the tacked on bit of relief in the final scene was kind of a copout for audiences that can't take dark endings.

            "content": "\u00a0There was a period in American filmmaking history where every movie looked great. All the shots were crisp and clear, the lighting was superb and every movie ,wether it was an idnie film or big blockbuster epic, looked high def. This was inbetween 2007-2011 and it was called The Deakins Period. \u00a0Roger Deakins is probably the most famous and influential cinematographer of our generation. Every single one of his movies are superbly photographed. Ever since No Country for Old Men he has created the most amazing looking movies of all time. From The Reader to True Grit to Skyfall all the way to the tiny indies like Doubt, Revolutionary Road and A Serious Man. If you just look at the trailers for these films then you'll understand the breathtaking shots this man produces.\u00a0\u00a0You could tell that after Deakins perfected the art of photography in No Country, every movie after that tried their best to look as good as a Deakins film. Some succeeded while others only touched the magic of this man's work. Soon enough every movie looked good enough to eat, but none of them could beat the beauty of a Deakins film. Every single shot of his is like a carefully crafted painting with strokes of lighting and camera movement perfection. Any director priviliged enough to work with him gets to have the best looking movie of that year. And that is exactly what Prisoners is. Yes, Prisoners of course looks amazing. All the shots were like big frames of candy for your brain to soak in. I could never take my eyes off the screen because of just how amazing every frame looked. It was so lush and clean. Hell, even a doorknob could reach the heights of the sexiest models on the planet. The dark shades and yellow hues made everything feel dark and gloomy, being exactly what\u00a0the film is. Prisoners is no fun family going film ride. Actually i suggest if you have kids then dont go at all because you will never want your little babies to be even a 10 foot radius away from you after experiencing this frightfully realistic motion picture.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0 Prisoners is about child abduction. Yes, that's what Prisoners is about. One of the worst subjects in society's history has a whole 2 and a half hour movie about it. It stars Hugh Jackman, Jake Gylenhall, Terence Winter, Paul Dano and Viola Davis. Prisoners chronicles the abduction of two regular middle class suburban little girls and how both the families cope with the situation and deal with it in their own way while a dedicated detective tries to find the girls before anything gets out of hand (And yes, trust me, things get out of hand very quickly). Prisoners is (almost) perfectly made. The mood of the films is meek and dreary, giving out a dreadful sense of worry the entire way through. It has moments of incredible suspense especially during the opening before the girls are kidnapped, A foreshadowing eeriness crawls through the first ten minutes or so and you're just waiting in horrible anticipation for the dreaded kidnapping moment to occur. As a hardcore drama thriller, Prisoner's tone keeps that definition the entire way through. It never veers into action or dark comedy because this subject matter is nothing to take lightly. It's completely serious \u00a0but not in a way where it's not entertaining. Its suspence keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will happen next. The film never misses a beat and although the film drags on a bit, it keeps you anticipating for what will happen next, making the 150 minute runining time more bearable. This is all thanks to director Denis Villenueve's incredible skill in precisee camera work and setting up the correct mood.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0 Hugh Jackman deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Lead Actor because he just kills it in this movie. He plays a tough, fighting father who will do anything , I mean ANYTHING to find his kid. Jackman just takes over the film with his commanding presence. Jackman's brutally tough persona along with his rough figure shows that he's scary person in general even if he is a loving father. Jackman has quite a few emotional scenes throughout and he pulls off every single one of them with perfection and deep emotion. What makes Jackman's chracter so great is that we hate the things he does to people so he can find his kids, but we understand where he's coming from and sympathize with him even during his most immoral scenes. Thus making us question our own moral values and what we'd do in sitaution like this. Would we follow Jackman's harsh torterous \u00a0ways or would we follow Terrence Winter's character and do what's \"right\"instead of risking everything to find our kids. Terence Winter's performance \u00a0EXCEPTIONAL. He doesn't have a big role i n this film and that bothers me. We get ALOT of Jackman's POV during the entire film but we hardly get to see what Winter's chracter is thinking or what he does. We dont get his side of the story and what he experiences. There isn't an even ground between the two characters thus making a very one sided story. The rest of the film is about Detective Loki (hell yeah, LOKI) played by Jake Gylenhall. Detective Loki is the one that is actually doing the investigating into the two missing girls. He's very dedicated to his job making him determined to find these two girls. His character is extremely realistic in a sense that he's not finding all the answers very quickly. He finds clues and leads but most of them don't mean anything forcing him to start all over again. He becomes frustrated \u00a0and lost to where he almost starts a whole new investigation on a totally different suspect. But this also creates flaws in the story. Even I, as a viewer, knew who the kidnapper was and i fit the clues faster together than the characters in the story. That took me out of the film when i figured out that i was smarter than the detective himself which reminded me that this is a character not a real person that i should be invested in. Also, the film drags on in bits where it seems like they're just killing time so there can be more suspence. Yes, it builds itself up to an awesome climax but it seemed like it was deliberatley doing it and trying to force me to be in a suspenceful mood. If screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski \u00a0had just written a more faster paced film with substantially better character development and a less predictable story, then Prisoners might have been a perfect film. This is not an easywatch for anyone. There's torture, suicide and just a a bad mood oeverall. But these things add to the movie making it s bit more sharp and entertaining. Prisoners represents the immorality inside all of us. No one in the world is a perfectly good person, becuase the devil lurks in us all. Great acting, sharp direction and a amazing cinematography, Prisoners is a substantially great film.\u00a0\r\n\r\nRecomendation: Not an easy watch for anyone, Prisoners is a must see for people \u00a0with a tough heart but not necesarilly an intellegent mind.\u00a0",

However, I do have to commend Director Denis Villenueve's brilliant thriller about a desperate father's actions after his daughter is missing. Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career as the Pennsylvania working-class father Keller Dover. On a Thanksgiving, Dover and his wife and two kids were celebrating the holiday at their best friends' home who are the Birches.; I guess those Sons of Birches could not just celebrate the holiday by themselves. Kidding! On that sad day, the Dovers' young daughter Anna and the Birches' young daughter Eve went missing; a mysterious RV parked in front of the Birches' home might have had something to do with it. When the driver of the RV named Alex Jones is arrested as a possible suspect, Kellen goes all \"cray cray\" in order for the police not to release him even though there is not suffice evidence to book Jones. Jake Gyllenhaal co-stars as Detective Loki, who is not the real \"loco\" in the picture, but does get obsessed to solve the case and find the missing girls. Villenueve's direction was superb and some might argue that he was sadly missing in the list of Oscar- nominated film directors for 2013. Aaron Guzilowski's screenplay was pure, even though \"Prisoners\" sometimes got locked up with some clich\u00e9s. It was great to see Jackman hide those big nails and singing voice, and transform himself into a character where he wore his emotions on his sleeve, and Hugh better believe that Jackman delivered the goods with his outstanding performance here. Gyllenhaal was also very good as Loki, as he continues his stellar acting career. Melissa Leo was stunning as the mysterious Aunt of Alex Jones; And speaking of Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones- Paul Dano delivered another effective cringe-worthy work as Alex Jones. Roger Deakins' cinematography of \"Prisoners\" was a scenic tour-de-force, even though I think that Deakins' \"arrested development\" of not getting the Oscars he deserves is a cinetragedy. OK, so I did write way too many pun-induced sentences for \"Prisoners\" after all; I guess that was a \"hard cell\" for you to believe I wouldn't. However, it is an easy sale for me to recommend the excellent \"Prisoners\". \n***** Excellent",

Some are a little more problematic, but not the most problematic aspect here.\n\nThe film's biggest problem is Hugh Jackman, who is simply unbelievable. The man goes from zero to psychotic vigilante almost instantly, and boy does it hurt the film BAD. There is no chance to sympathize with him, no chance to understand his plight, no chance to connect with him. The difficult part is whether this is the script's fault or Jackman's. Jackman certainly doesn't help by going completely bonkers in the first 15 minutes and staying bonkers until the end. Then again, the script doesn't give much of a chance for a transition. He goes from pious guy to straight-up lunatic really rapidly.\n\nEveryone else is alright, though nobody really stands out. Still, better not drag it down than try to be a glory hog, I suppose. Deakins' cinematography, rightfully Oscar-nominated is astounding.\n\nThe film does overstay its welcome after a while, but it doesn't drag. It doesn't feel like a 2.5 hour film.",

It's a bit of torture porn that this movie almost seems to be based on. In that movie, a physician's daughter is killed and he takes and killer and tortures him for seven days. Then he delivers a brilliant line at the end. This is a bit like that movie but with all the ridiculous twists.\n\nDidn't think the acting was horrible. Actually thought Dano was borderline brilliant as a complete oddball. Gyllenhaal's dark character was kind of likable but not real believable. Jackman is effective enough, and Howard, who has one of my favorite voices, doesn't do much.\n\nIf you make a mystery involving an RV and two missing girls, that should just about do it. To make it drag on past two hours and throw in some ridiculous kinks? I guess I don't see the point.",

The performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are the standouts as you'd expect, but everyone does a good job here. I enjoyed this movie not just for the strong narrative and characters, but the cinematography and attention to detail is amazing. The initial reaction to the movie as a whole can be a little jarring because it's so intense and dark, but it's definitely a soon to be cult classic once people get around to seeing it.",

Hugh Jackman shows his full strength as an actor as Keller, and flawlessly becomes a man desperate for answers who has some demons of his own.  Gyllenhaal's previous role as a cop in End of Watch may have helped him prepare for the sheer intensity of his role in Prisoners as a cold yet diligant detective who is married to the job, and refuses to give up until he unconvers the truth.  Prisoners takes two men with the same agenda and progressively shows the differences in methodology and mentality they go through to find two missing girls.  A very well written film that keeps you guessing, Prisoners will leave you wondering about the differences between right and wrong, and when/ if there can be any exceptions to that rule.",

            "content": "Of all the films that have come out this year, Prisoners is by far one of the most underrated. It is one of the most unpleasant yet fascinating morality tale. It is not only one of the best films of the year, but one of the few films that went beyond my expectations. \r\n\r\nDuring one raining afternoon, two young girls are kidnapped, leaving the two families devastated. The two fathers, played by Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard are dealing with the stress of their families when an seemingly obvious suspect, played by Paul Dano, seems to have gone missing. Though it turns out Jackman's character has kidnapped him in order to torture him for information. Meanwhile detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, suspects there is much more to this case than meets the eye.\r\n\r\nLets start by talking about the best aspect of the film: the acting. This is by far one of the most well acted films of the year. Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis are all amazing and convincing in their roles, making the kidnapping scenario feel all the more real. Gyllenhaal is also pretty damn good playing the brilliant but flawed cop. But by the best performance in the entire film, that should have earned an Oscar nod, is Hugh Jackman. I've always been a fan of him, but this is one of his best roles. He always walks the fine line between sympathetic father and brutal extremist. It is much harder to find the balance between these two personalities, but Jackman is wonderful. \r\n\r\nWhile the story is a little straightforward and very reminiscent of Gone Baby Gone, I certainly loved the dark tone and moral and ethical questions raised in this film. How far would go to save your family? What if you're wrong? What if you killed an innocent man? These are some of the questions raised, but never fully answered, leaving it up to the audience to decide. That and how beautiful this movie is shot. For a film so dark, both thematically and visually, the cinematography is amazing. It was one of the few things the Academy got right this year by nominating it for Best Cinematography. \r\n\r\nIf I had one grip with the film, it is the twist. It is not bad by any means, and it is very shocking. But my problem is with the motivation of the villain. It feels a little cliched while the rest of the film was so realistic. That and some of the twists get a little too complicated. \r\n\r\nIt is still one of the best films of the year, though I would not recommend for everyone, especially for parents, given how dark and realistic it is. Still, the overall picture is worth a few flaws.\r\n\r\n***1/2 (out of 4)",

        {
            "content": "Produced by busy bee actor Mark Wahlberg and helmed by acclaimed Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, Prisoners is the type of vehicle that is perfect for fall movie going season. It was filmed in Georgia (which I believe, was made to look like a drab part of Pennsylvania), takes place during Thanksgiving, and harbors a non-stop sense of doom and gloom from its opening frame (I think the sun shined maybe once during the entire 2 and a half hour running time). Listen, I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you, this picture is long, feels long, and it really takes its time. Villeneuve uses old school filming techniques and doesn't project anything flashy at all. The story, when it's all said and done however, is somewhat conventional. Therefore, I think it was necessary for the events to be drawn out and dragged through the muck a little. Based on an initial viewing, I realized that Prisoners would have felt like a TV movie and/or a Law and Order episode if the running time was trimmed to say, an hour and a half. Thankfully, it comes off as an extended director's cut (I'm not the only critic that felt this way) and that to a fault, is what makes the flick work. Watching it, I was reminded of a David Fincher film (without Fincher's signature style though) and not just because it starred staggeringly disciplined actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Prisoners is basically a mild spawn of Fincher's Se7en and Zodiac. It's not quite as effectively creepy as those films, but it's definitely good enough to recommend.  \n\nPart kidnapping movie, part police detective character study, and part fatherly vigilante escapade, Prisoners tells the story of two families (neighbors from across the street) who get together on Thanksgiving day. The Birch's (Franklin Birch played by Terrence Howard and Nancy Birch played by Viola Davis who barely registers here) and the Dover's (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as Keller and Grace Dover) have a relaxing, calming holiday until their respective daughters wander off and go missing. This then gets the attention of a socially inept area detective (Mr. Loki played with vigor by Jake Gyllenhaal) who garners almost complete control over handling the missing person's case. As days go by and a potential suspect who might've taken the children gets bounced free, Jackman's angry, frustrated character eventually decides to take the law into his own hands. As the film slowly creeps toward its conclusion, you get small twists and turns (as well as slightly minimal character revelations). You also get to see how important drawing mazes are when it comes to character motivation (I've seen all kinds of thrillers and this plot point was a first for me). \n\nOn the acting front, one thing to notice when viewing Prisoners, is how it pushes aside the other performers in the main cast (Oscar nominees like Viola Davis and Terrence Howard) and puts its main focus on Jackman. Now I'm not saying that Hugh Jackman is a mediocre actor. I just don't think he has the fiery chops to take on such a serious, dramatic role. His fault lies in the extreme overacting and preening to the audience. He seems to be saying, \"hey look at me, I should be nominated for an Oscar!\" With all the focus on him, the other player's roles become seriously underdeveloped. It gets to the point where you hardly see them anymore. Using little of no background music, there are a lot of carefully set up scenes in Prisoners. To a fault, Jackman appears in almost all of them. Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), the only other actor receiving top billing, takes up almost as much of the shared time. The difference with Gyllenhaal is that he quietly out acts his co-star. His minutes on screen are underplayed but they feel more genuine, more studied (Gyllenhaal's character's facial ticks like eye blinking were a nice touch), and generally more effective. He seems born to play his role. Jackman on the other hand, has one persuasive agent (he probably needs to stick to his strengths which are the X-Men movies).  \n\nAs a fall release that feels as if it's a journey or a metaphoric expedition, Prisoners has a teaser of an ending that may leave viewers holding their hands in the air. The over length may also be a factor when it comes to their varied attention spans. I however, found this exercise mildly absorbing and it was able to keep me interested. You may find the opening ten minutes a little muddled and weak in terms of set up, but after that, this exercise will place you in its grip (not too tightly) and not let go. Like I said earlier, Prisoners makes its case for being serviceable because it rides the wave of other crime dramas filling the screen with gloomy, overcast, and rain-drenched sequences. While watching it, you can almost sense that it does hold back just a little. This film doesn't take too many risks and it may not haunt you like it should (Villeneuve's direction is overly careful). But hey, it still gets by though mainly because of said look and Gyllenhaal's icy magnitude. All in all, if you like crime thrillers that take their time and don't try to jerk you around with the camera, Prisoners might just set you \"free.\"",

It's the story of 2 little girls who go missing and their families. Hugh Jackman plays the father of one of the missing kids and Jake Gyllenhaal plays the detective. I'm not going to get too deep into the story, but lets just say it's one of the best thriller/dramas I've seen in a while. and I'm not even a fan of these kinds of movies! Usually I just walk away halfway through the movie, finding it boring and tedious. But this has to be one of the best of its kind. It's a very sad and disturbing viewing experience, but I would highly suggest anybody to go and watch this film.",

Director Villeneuve utilizes a good cast (even if they might be overly categorized in their roles) to push these questions in to emotions for the viewer. And for most of the film it certainly works. It keeps pushing and pulling and twisting, and avoids taking any easy corners. The basic premise, the abduction of two daughters and the response of the families (with a particular focus on the fathers) is told in line with the detective who refuses to accept failure for an answer. The few gaps in the story are forgivable as the ride proves to be more than intense to keep you watching.",

But this movie went on for more than two hours and I didn't feel the time at all. The constant tension and the suspense makes it all seem very short. It was neither rushed nor prolonged. Just perfect. And of course, Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman can't take all of the credit. Denis Villeneuve did such an astonishing job with the film. It's incredible.\nI give this movie a five.",

In the beginning minutes (which lead you into two and half hours) the story of raw emotion revealing a parent's worst nightmare: the disappearance of a child or in this case two families loss (neighbors.)  A strange camper parked earlier near the girls homes (they climb the vehicle's ladder and play around it until finally the older siblings remove them. So the RV and its occupant is quickly found as the driver crashes into a tree and escaping to elude arrest. This is where the film goes all wrong. What ensues is unspeakable violence by one of the parents after the \"suspect\" is released. The Father of one child (Hugh Jackman) jumps him in the police parking lot.  While Jackman is attacking the suspect he hears a disturbing statement which leads us down a very violent and tedious road. This film is horribly disturbing and violent, so much so you need to look away.  In the meantime the viewer is led in so many directions and twists (which seems intentional) that you feel as though you're witnessing a multi-car accident which the police are crippled to unravel.\n\nFrom a director that said he was \"surprised\" that the studio gave this film the green light is an indicator what you're in for and none of it is good. Three endings were shot and a test audience chose the worst. Jake Gyllenhaal is the detective who has never failed to solve an abduction crime and is sadly not convincing here. His age is veiled in tattoos and bad hair.\n\nWhere this ends of course will not be told here. This was like going to an amusement park with a huge anticipation of that great new ride and when you get off you walk away hugely disappointed wanting your money back.",

While Prisoners is totally different than Villeneuve's 'Incendies', which was a masterpiece, it's still very good in its own right as a more 'traditional' thriller.

            "content": "Pray for the best, prepare for the worst. This is the philosophy by which Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a carpenter living in Pennsylvania, lives by. He tells his teenaged son that the most important lesson his father taught him was to be ready for anything, but nothing could have prepared him for what is about to happen.\n\nDover and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are happily married with a teenaged son and a young daughter. The film opens with them going to eat Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbors, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their two children of the same age as the Dover's kids. What starts out as a happy feast between the two families transforms into every parent's worst nightmare when the two young daughters ask if they can go to the Dovers' quickly. The children are allowed to leave, but they never return.\n\nAlex Jones (Paul Dano), who was driving an RV through the neighborhood around the same time the girls disappeared, is quickly apprehended and labeled the prime suspect. The problem is, Jones has the IQ of a ten-year-old, meaning there is no way he could successfully kidnap the girls and not leave a shred of evidence. So, he is released into the custody of his aunt (Melissa Leo) with orders to not leave the state. It doesn't come as a surprise that the parents, Keller in particular, are less than thrilled about this.\n\nHugh Jackman has delivered some good performances in the past, most notably as the superhero Wolverine, but this is by far the best performance of his career. As the film progresses, Keller slowly becomes the kind of demon that a religious man like him would condemn. Although he is a man that the audience should feel remorse for, his actions throughout the film make you consider losing faith in him, but they also make you think long and hard about what you would do if you were in the same situation as him.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the lead detective on the case with a perfect arrest record and a determined look in his eyes. Unlike Keller, Loki doesn't have a personal life to speak of. Instead of celebrating Thanksgiving with family and friends, we see him eating his dinner in a diner and having a conversation with his waitress over the signs of the Chinese Zodiac on his placemat.\n\nThroughout the film, Keller and Loki butt heads every time they share the screen. Keller is determined to find his daughter by any means necessary. Loki is just as determined, but police scrutiny and his sound methods are leading the case in a direction that Keller doesn't agree with and there is nothing Loki can say or do that will convince him otherwise.\n\nThe performances in the film are all top notch. Jackman and Gyllenhaal both deliver the best performances of their careers, each worthy of award consideration. Bello, Howard, and Davis don't have as much screen time as you would expect considering they're the parents just as much as Keller is. Dano, who I never really have liked as an actor, gives a great performance, his character's clothing and just the general look on his face make him seem like a total creep. Leo also shines in a small, but pivotal role, and Wayne Duvall also does some fine work as the chief of police that is making Loki follow the evidence instead of his gut. The real stars here, however, are the people behind the camera. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) had not made an English language film prior to this, but his previous films have displayed his talents from behind the camera and they show again here. Screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) took a generic plot idea and turned it on its side with a script that keeps the audience guessing while incorporating some powerful religious-based overtones to the story. Icelandic composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson's score is electrifying. And the cinematography is some of the best from the great Roger Deakins, who has ten Academy Award nominations dating back to 1991, it's that good.\n\nAs good a film as it is, Prisoners is not for everyone. Some of most pivotal scenes involve torture that might make you feel uneasy later on. The two-and-a-half hour running time and the slow pacing make the film drag on at certain points. With a little sharper editing, I think this film would have come out just as good, if not better, with a running time of about 20 minutes shorter, but the problem is that I can't think of any scene that would have been better of if left on the cutting room floor. That is my only issue with this movie, though. You will not forget Prisoners after you see it.\n\nFILM GRADE: A-",

The questions that Prisoners asks the audience to ponder are deep, and the movie goes places that are far from comfortable: how far would you go for someone you love? Would you be willing to go against your morals? Many of these characters choose to do so, but Jackman seems to be the only one that doesn't feel much remorse. Speaking of him, Jackman and Gyllenhaal are outstanding, as is practically the entire ensemble cast, and the script lends itself well to the actors. The movie definitely had me guessing for a while, although I feel like most people in the audience will be able to figure out the culprit half an hour before the reveal. Still, Prisoners justifies its long running time with constant thrills and heartbreak, displaying a pedigree of film making that is very rare in most mysteries nowadays. It's bound to be buried under all the other Oscar contenders, but that doesn't change the fact that it's one of 2013's best films. And man, talk about a depressing ending.",

I kinda felt sorry for the kid with the glasses. But, these actors really did shine on this flick and I can damn well say that it was a good suspense movie that really got you involved. My only oroblem was the beginning was a bit draggy and boring. All in all though, this movie was great! As for the cliff hanger at the very end. It was good too. There were some parts that just weren't explained too clearly though. But, if I were to recommend this movie to anyone, I would.",

            "content": "I had a bit of a problem while watching this movie. It was both very disturbing and very annoying in equal measure. What starts off as a movie about a kidnapping then escalates into a maze of character development and wrong turns. This could have been HUGE flaw if it weren't for the actors. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal do a tremendous job at keeping the film afloat. If they hadn't it would have made people sleepy and exhausted. The running time as well furthers the aggravation (which I guess is appropriate because it makes you feel for these two characters and the situation at hand). It's nearly 3 hours long and much of it is stretched over the character development of Jackman's character.\n\nKeller Dover is the type of man who is always ready for when a disaster is going to happen. He's one of those very cautious people who is already prepared for doomsday even before it happens. He's deeply religious too, married and has one son and one daughter. That is until one day on Thanksgiving, his daughter is suddenly taken from him. She and another daughter from a close friend of Keller's are kidnapped and this throws both families into emotional turmoil. Where are their children?\n\nDetective Loki is assigned to the case and his skepticism doesn't do both family any good. Loki, at first, isn't too concerned since he has no family of his own. So he can't exactly relate. What he is able to do is function as a detective in solving a crime. Even to the extreme. \n\nA suspect is found in Alex Jones who lives with Holly Jones (his aunt) for many years. Alex has the mental capacity of a 10 year old and it was his RV that was spotted outside Keller's home. Alex is the link to where the little girl's are and Keller knows this. When Alex is booked and questioned, evidence is immediately nowhere. A conviction isn't in the books and Alex is free to go. \n\nThis is where Keller goes from a good Christian family man into a man seeking answers in the name of vengeance.\n\nThis movie incorporates some brutal tactics. Torture is used as a device on Alex in getting him to talk and there's a level of pedophilia that is rampant in tone that adds to the dread. Director Denis Villeneuve does an amazing job with the atmosphere in this story. The fall/winter season, this film is set around, is captured perfectly and makes the film that much more interesting! Because if it were set in the Spring or Summer it wouldn't have been as interesting with all those sunny day shots in what is suppose to be a dreary story. These kinds of stories don't need the sun, they belong in the dark and cloudy.\n\nTwists and turns do generate a series of questions the viewer will have while watching it. That is unless you're clever enough to easily spot who it REALLY is.\n\nOverall, the performances and direction are the highlight in this overlong mystery.",

He always catches his man but this case is bigger than he thought and must find Dover daughter before the case goes cold. \n\nThis is one of the best movies of 2013. No other movie this year made me feel so nervous. This movie made me  have that same uneasy feeling I did the first time saw No Country for Old Men. The film reminded me of Seven a bit just because of the dark subject matter and the cold atmosphere surrounding it. It has that same nasty grit that Seven had. \n\nNow, let's talking about performances. Hugh Jackman brought so much to this movie. He shows so much emotion in this movie and I've never seen him better. There are scene in this where he just loses all fate that he will never find his daughter and scenes where is truly ferocious. As of right now, he WILL win an Oscar for his performance in this. \n\nJake Gyllenhaal also brings something new. He has never played a role like this where he has to show a lot of anger and control. I just can't stress enough how good everyone is in this movie.",

            "content": "One more Hollywood recruiter of foreign talents, Canadian Villeneuve (from INCENDIES 2010) submits his Tinseltown debut with a dark drama about a child abduction, congregated by a swathe of bankable thespians and a virtuoso DP Roger Deakins, it was a considerable success both in box office and among critics, although its Oscar prospect will not likely pan out. \n\nPRISONERS conventionally chronicles the appalling case with thorough stoicism to supply enormous stretches to the key performers, Jackson and Gyllenhaal are the two leading players, one is a dogged father believes in his own judgment and is pressured to take extreme measures to fish out information of his missing daughter; another is an idiosyncratic cop has to probe into a sordid scenario while his own backstory remains veiled. Through all these years Gyllenhaal has honed up his screen personality substantially and his quirky foibles (the compulsive blinking here) make him more human while Jackman is a tad over-the-top with a more straightforward character development. \n\nBello, as the flip side of Jackson, her post-trauma symptom is being fully destroyed, cannot function anymore, a devastating mother is a piece of cake for her; Howard and Davis pair stand for a more neutral ethnic line here, which one can relate to oneself under the context, but their shortcomings are as glaring as they are ubiquitous. Dano, who takes us aback with another ambivalent career-turn, his make-up in the torture scenes is too surreal for general viewers, theoretically we should feel sympathetic for him, but somehow he manages to diminish this feeling with his look of opaqueness, is he a real retarded victim or a lackey enjoys the gore? It is a moot point where lingers great aftertaste. We cannot leave Melissa Leo behind here since she is the hidden culprit, her reasons for killing aside, her performance does enhance the story's credibility, and although her downfall is ordained, her encounter with Jackson in the ultimate confrontation is gold and only she can emotionally overpower and cramp Wolverine into his redemption into the darkness. \n\nVilleneuve proves wonderfully he is a dab hand can handle challenging projects like this, the whole production team is top-notch, Deakins' camera irradiates specifically in the car sequences near the end, alongside the cutthroat editing, a subdued iridescence can never be more ravishing and what's more praiseworthy is that it thrusts the narrative into its ultimacy with utter urgency and dazzlement. \n\nPRISONERS sits comfily into my top 10 year-list, PICTURE, DIRECTOR, LEADING ACTOR (2 spots), SUPPORTING ACTOR and SUPPORTING ACTRESS, for my no-gut-no-glory Oscar prediction, I sincerely hope Deakins can sneak in, alas, even so, he is no chance of winning over GRAVITY (2013, 9/10).",

            "content": "In 2011, Canadian director Denis Villeneuve's \"Incendies\" received an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language film. For that, he depicted a family that ventured on a journey of discovery. In \"Prisoners\", Villeneuve turns his eye to another bleak family drama where 'discovery' is, once again, the driving force behind his characters' motivations.\n\nAfter a thanksgiving meal, two young girls go missing. The fathers of the girls, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) refuse to accept the procedure of the police in their investigation and take it upon themselves to be very active in the manhunt. When the main suspect (Paul Dano) is released from custody,  Keller takes extreme measures in finding the answers to his daughters whereabouts.\n\nSet in a cold, working class, Northwestern town, the look and feel for \"Prisoners\" is established from the off-set. It's harsh and bleak environment is reflective of the characters that inhabit it and Villeneuve wastes no time in depicting it's grim tale of child abduction. In it's early stages and premise, both of the lead actors reminded me very much of two Sean Penn films: Jackman's tortured father resembled that of Penn's character in \"Mystic River\" and Gyllenhaal's doggedly determined police officer echoed the work of Jack Nicholson in Penn's marvellous directorial outing \"The Pledge\". Like these aforementioned films, \"Prisoners\" benefits from being anchored by these powerful leads. I'm not normally a fan of Jackman but the man cannot be faulted here, in his ferocious turn as a protective father, stricken helpless and with no control over his situation or grief. His furious and emotional outbursts are entirely believable and Gyllenhaal's subtle ticks and repressed display of a very similar character compliments the work of Jackman. On the outskirts, an impressive supporting cast are assembled in Paul Dano; Oscar winner Melissa Leo and Nominees Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, although the very talented likes of Davis and Howard are somewhat wasted in thankless roles that don't utilise their talents to the full.\n\nIn capturing the stark environment, cinematographer Roger Deakins delivers some sublime work. In a time of recession, this small town has little or no future and it's grim reality and sense of desperation and paranoia oozes from every pore. Villeneuve also cleverly plays with time; the town has come to a standstill during the investigation and even though every day counts for the grief stricken families, time seems laborious and torturous. The twists and turns of events unfold at their own pace making this, for the most part, a very tight and involving thriller. However, at two and half hours, the film is a little overlong with the final 30 minutes consisting of some tenuous and cliched plot developments and a few too many red herrings but these only stand out because the film is so strong up until then.\n\nA solid and unrelenting thriller that has some uncomfortable moments and an ever shifting moral compass. \"Prisoners\" is the perfect title in describing the entrapment - in one way or another - of each of the characters but when it comes to the audience, director Villeneuve doesn't take any.\n\nMark Walker",

A haunting story with mesmerizing performances this movie is a gritty and intensive piece of film-making which in spite of being a bit overlong, constitutes Jean Villeneuve as one of the very interesting Canadian director exports to Hollywood.\n\nThe movie delves deeper into one of the biggest fears of parents: kidnapping and possible death of their young, beloved children. In a very straight-forward manner, director Denis Villeneuve throws the audience into a complex story which with the time turns into an ethical exploration and bold film-making. Franklin Rich (Terrence Howard) and Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman)'s daughters are kidnapped on Thanksgiving and it is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is appointed the task of discovering them. Quickly, Keller decides that he should take things in his hands and challenges Loki's detective methods. By trying to find his daughter, Keller challenges the audience throughout the whole movie with the question: how far could he go; how far is ethically, morally acceptable. All these questions are at moments strengthen or weakened by the police procedures, the religious and emotional complexity of the whole movie.\n\nIt is true that Prisoners is much longer than necessary and that the pacing is not an example for a breath-taking criminal thriller.It is also true that the very experienced fans of the genre, with an eye for details, would probably solve the mystery towards the middle of the movie. Still,thanks to the wonderful performances of Gyllenhaal and Jackman, combined with Villeneuve's ability to stretch the emotions and to upset the audience ,this movie turns into a 140 minute challenge, which is worth-investing in.  Then after, the final credits, just like in his previous masterpiece, Incendies, Villeneuve lets the viewers confused and challenged both emotionally and philosophically.\n\nDespite the early-Oscar buzz, Prisoners will most probably fall short of earning Oscar nods or awards. Nevertheless, this movie is a wonderful opening of the Awards season and a must see for all types of moviegoers: from fans of the genre, to casual blockbuster viewers.",

Unlike his previous films which focus on the heights people will rise to in desperate situations, Prisoners focuses on the depths they will sink to at their most desperate. It's not an easy film, but it explores some big questions about right and wrong. It also boasts some spectacular performances, particularly Viola Davis as the mother of Joy, one of the abducted girls. She is, for my money, the best actress currently working in Hollywood and once again manages to steal the screen every time she is on it. \n\nPrisoners biggest weakness is in its under use of many of its actors. I know that to give them all parts as big as Jackman's and Jake Gyllenhaal would create an overly bloated film, but overall there is a feeling of an attempt at an ensemble piece, that was high jacked by the leads. It's not that Jackman and Gyllenhaal are not up to the task that's been given to them, but that the supporting cast have risen above and beyond and therefore overshadow them a bit. In addition to Davis, Paul Dano is wonderful as the suspected abductor in another role with very little dialogue and Melissa Leo is pitch perfect as his guardian. I want to see these peoples perspectives in addition to that of Keller Dover. \n\nThere is also an issue with the ending, with the motives behind the girls abduction left murky and unclear. This is a small gripe however as that is not what the film is about. It would have been nice to have a slightly shorter running time as well as it starts to drag and degrade into a cheap thriller with too much exposition in the final moments. \n\nOverall Prisoners is an interesting character study and it is nice to see a film that doesn't treat life as a Disney film.",

This is not only one of the best films of the year but one of the greatest thrillers I have ever seen. Honestly I think it beats Finchers 7. This film is masterfully directed and has an amazing script. Tension just everywhere. Several scenes are \"holy shit\" worthy. I think the heart of the film both lies in Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal who give the finest performances Ive ever seen from them. Roger Deakins who shot the film deserves an Oscar for his work as the town has this blue murky tint to it that just makes it that much scarier. On a side note Paul Dano is creepy as shit as a suspect but the real scary one is another suspect who is played by the actor from TDK who is the paranoid schizophrenia Joker helper. He has this face that just doesnt look human. This film needs to be used in screenwriting classes on how to build tension through a 2.5 hour run time. I was hooked from the opening shot and didnt look away until the credits rolled.",

Maybe we are on a different page here, or more on a different wavelength, but for me this thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve, with cinematography by Roger Deakins, was exciting, and thought provoking, emotional, engaging and with outstanding acting. What a cast! Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano  - for me the weakest point was Terrence Howard, but even his acting was satisfactory enough not to criticize it too much. \r\n\r\nBuilding up the plot was so natural and easy going that the later part focusing on the actual abduction of two young girls in Pennsylvania and the resulting search to find them, was a logical follow up with enough twists and smart clues to keep us all glued to the seats. \r\nExcellently developed character of Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a deeply religious man who runs a struggling carpentry business, from the beginning when he attends a Thanksgiving dinner with his family at the house of their neighbours, the Birches, was carrying most of the story \"on his shoulders\" with the help of  detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). I enjoyed every second watching these two actors showing us the real master actors at work! Very powerful performances which could not be ignored. \r\n\r\nThe emotional complexity will take you from the first few minutes and you will sense a sense of dread that makes for absorbing viewing which could disturb some viewers. I liked the movie, I liked the story, I liked the acting... recommended for everyone I know!",

Unfortunately both characters get in the others' way. The \"whodunnit\" aspect is handled really well with plenty of twists and turns and wondering whether people are innocent victims or defiant perpetrators.The cast is pretty strong although there's little focus on the other three parents which is a shame. There's also a lot of \"why didn't they just do that\" scenarios where the case should/could have been solved but the film does show the police aren't that effective - although I'd have thought a specialised team would have been called out. That aside an interesting and tense film.",

When the prime suspect, introverted teenager (Paul Dano), is released, one of the fathersm Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands in very gruesome fashion.\n\nThis is definitely one of the year's best acting ensembles with the cast also including Maria Bello as Jackman's wife who falls into deep depression and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as the two other parents who Jackman's character tries to involve in his plans. Howard and Davis's couple are the opposite of Jackman-Bello with Howard the more vulnerable and Davis attempting to showcase strength. But it is Jackman who excels  in delivering another career-best performance after his exceptional, Oscar-nominated work last year in \"Les Miserables\" as a very tough and aggressive man who lets his fatherly instincts get the best of him. Melissa Leo is also exceptional in a brief role as Dano's aunt who raised him. Dano is also very good as the psychologically disturbed character. The movie's weak spot is Gyllenhaal but his acting is not at fault with the script mostly to blame for his character's lack of development. He embodies the character's obsession with the case (plus the occasional twitches) but other than that we know nothing about this key character. \n\nThe movie works well as both the story of a father and as a mystery. There are so many elements to the plot and multiple characters are introduced that all come full circle by the film's end that is very difficult to predict (despite my best efforts). There is not a single scene that is redundant, which is a testament to the film's great writing (kudos to screenwriter's Aaron Guzikowski, who only has 2012's mediocre \"Contraband\" to his credit, for this original story). Canadian director Denis Villeneuvue (who helmed 2011's Oscar nominated \"Incendies\") does an excellent job here in creating a very grim atmosphere throughout. This is by no means an easy movie-going experience - you will be attentive and at the edge of your seat throughout its 2hr30min running time.",

Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve, follows up his Oscar nominated film, Incendies, with this intense thriller that manages to capture the audiences attention once again.

While the two families are having a lovely time together, Joy and Anna decide to go back to Anna's house, but when the Dover's come back home they are horrified to discover that the kids never made it back. Ralph remembers that they were playing next to a strange RV that was parked up front which is now gone. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is appointed as the lead investigator in the case and the first thing he does is locate the RV. The driver is a disturbed young man named Alex Jones (Paul Dano) who has the IQ of a 10 year old and with no evidence to incriminate him Detective Loki has to let him free. His Aunt (Melissa Leo) comes to pick him up and explains how naive and innocent he is. As hours pass, Keller begins to get more desperate and convinced that Alex was involved he decides to take matters into his own hands. From here on the tension begins to escalate as they try to solve the mystery.\n\nPrisoners succeeds as a neo-noir thriller building up a lot of tension with a very dark atmosphere which is perfectly captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins. It adds to the mysterious mood of the story which on its own is already pretty intense. The screenplay, written be Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband), is very well written with a very interesting premise and some great twists. My only complaint with this film has to do with the lack of a strong female character. With such a strong cast, I thought that Maria Bello or Viola Davis could have been given a stronger role, but the film focuses mostly on Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. They both give very strong and convincing performances, and Gyllenhaal has surprised me over the last three years with very good films (Source Code, End of Watch, and now this one). I guess he has been choosing his roles very wisely lately because his next film also looks interesting (Enemy which is also directed by Denis Villeneuve). Paul Dano also gave a strong performance as his character's motivations were very hard to decipher.
