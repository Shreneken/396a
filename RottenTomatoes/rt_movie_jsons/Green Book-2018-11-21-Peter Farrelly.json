    "summary": "Dr. Don Shirley is a world-class African-American pianist who's about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. In need of a driver and protection, Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx. Despite their differences, the two men soon develop an unexpected bond while confronting racism and danger in an era of segregation.",

It finishes at Christmas and I'm slightly surprised not to see it established as 'one of those films' that gets shown at that time of year. Nice balance between the  Italian driver and the talented black musician. Tackles racism without ramming the message down your throat. Enjoyable. Recommended.",

I would recommend this movie to everyone and anyone. I don't know how I missed it when it came out but I regret not being able to see this on the big screen. I wish all other media would sit down, watch this movie, and take notes. This is how you write a good-quality movie on breaking down racial and social barriers in a way that is not condescending. It tells a story instead of preaching a message. However, it has a great message to say.",

Love seeing the two main guys' relationship develop. There are some funny moments with Tony being a goon and the doctor making fun of him. Awesome ending to see Tony's wife embrace the doctor. Would rewatch but not high on the list",

This was a 3/4 star film and at best should've only been nominated. Movies similar such as Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile and Driving Miss Daisy were 4/4 star films and thus were better than Greenbook and deserved Best Picture. I think this film won for two reasons, 1. Their weren't that many other good films that came out the same year. And 2.

I'm not sure there's much I can say about it - I'm not too keen on David Walliams - I'm not exactly a fan of him normally and it felt a little 'off' to have him appear in such a period film but perhaps I'm a little unfair? judge for yourself and also it goes without saying that Helena Bonham Carter is very much suited to her role - I imagine she enjoyed playing Miss Haversham very much and she certainly looks the part, as the gothic, somewhat ghostly lady living in a dark and run down mansion/house of sorts.

The wonderful, complex, sparring, evolving and mutually enlightening relationship between Don and  Tony is exquisitely portrayed which makes it one of those rare cinematic experiences that truly encompasses more than its two hours ten minutes might promise. The balance in Green Book impresses me too, with themes of family, race, friendship, the scourge of intolerance and the liberation of acceptance combined in such a natural, spontaneous way that I'd recommend this as more or less essential viewing for film makers wanting to treat with these theses - this one gets it right, guys.

            "content": "My main reason for watching 'Green Book' was due to me wanting to see as many 2018 films as possible, and that it had won the Best Picture Oscar (so naturally wanted to see too that it was that good). Like Viggo Mortensen as an actor, the film's concept was appealing and it looked appetising. Word of mouth, including from very trusted friends online and in real life, was very positive so there were plenty of other reasons too.\n\n'Green Book' turned out to be when watching a very good film and nearly a great one with many fantastic things. Wouldn't go as far to say that it is my favourite film of 2018, and as far as the other Best Picture nominees go there was a preference for 'Roma' and 'The Favourite', but if to put it in a group of either best, solid middle and worst films of the year 'Green Book' would be closest to being in the best category of those three groups. It is a very, very well done film and its good intentions are evident throughout and noble.\n\nIt could have done with more grit in places, really do appreciate that it was trying not to be heavy-handed or trying to offend with a quite heavy theme but they could have done more with it and given a little more depth to what there was. Not saying it wasn't there, quite the contrary, just wish there was more.\n\nCredit is due for the laudable and successful efforts in making the story accessible and it is one that easy to like and get into, but actually it could have afforded to do a little more risk-taking and have a little more complexity.\n\nViggo Mortensen though brings a lot of charm and entertainment value to his role, and Mahershala Ali is a dignified and very moving contrast. Their chemistry is wholly natural and beautifully irresistible (never feeling contrived or rushed) which provides a lot of 'Green Book's' heart, while their characters are more than just characters and instead feel very human. This is very different territory for director Peter Farrelly and it is surprisingly restrained direction from him and it suits the material very well. It's a lovely looking film too and affectionately photographed, while the music is beautifully chosen and fitted some nice nostalgic song choices here.\n\nThe script is thoughtful, charming and also moving, and regardless of anybody feeling that it is a little too accessible and could have done with more grit the story kept me riveted and left me moved, inspired and like my heart had been warmed. The YMCA scene is a powerful one and a character development turning point handled beautifully.\n\nSumming up, one of those very good and nearly great films. 8/10",

I saw a lot of people recommending this movie on the internet. This movie not only won three Oscar awards for Best Picture, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Screenplay, but also won Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. From all I've heard, I had  very high expectations for this movie and it turns out it didn't let me down and even better than I thought it would.\n\nA story is about a relationship between black touring pianist Don Shirley and his white Italian personal driver Tony Lip by the main subjects is to reflect funny given its rather serious social setting of racial discrimination in 1960s America but funny is still given along the movie. Tony Vallelonga used to be a bouncer at  a 1960s nightclub in New York but ended up as a temporary personal driver to African-American pianist Don Shirley. They need to carry The Green Book, a guide to hotels and restaurants hospitable to black people during the drive down south. The movie includes sexual identity subject once then moves on without any other discussion. The two characters are contrasted in both personality and social status but they get to learn from each other during this 8 weeks drive. Don is a virtuoso who has a snobbish manner. He always responds to every racial slight and stands for himself which is really inspiring and impressive. Conversely, Tony is a chill person. He represents an ignorant person who wouldn't take any action in racism. Their road trip makes them have self-discovery as well as exploring other different societies. \n\nOverall, I think The Green Book is a really great movie that has an impact on the subject about racism along the route of road-tripping with the guide book. It is really inspiring in terms of maintaining self dignity and reminds me to always respect others and also my own self.",

            "content": "This film is a wonderful example of how biography, comedy, and drama can all work together. I had never heard of or read about this film before seeing it, which gave me an unexpected thought about it. At first, I believe that this film will be similar to other biographical films that I have seen in the past, boring and unpersuasive. However, after watching it for ten minutes, I am blown away by what I perceive. This film has taught me something new that I didn't know before, and the actors are completely immersed in their characters.\n\nDr. Don Shirley, an African American intelligent pianist, and Tony Lip, a tough bouncer hired to be Dr. Don's personal driver since the nightclub where he previously worked was closed for renovations, were initially unimpressed in one other. They have no idea what each other has gone through or what they need to be face with. Taking us back to that time, even if he was a great pianist, the black guy constantly struggled to acquire respect from others. Despite the fact that many people want to listen to the music he performs, they nevertheless act as though black people are not on the same level as them. Even if they didn't say it out loud, their actions did.\n\nThe film depicts the development of characters while also showing the progress of their relationship. It's as though they're demonstrating that even people with opposing personalities may one day open their hearts to one another. This film is of the biography genre and is based on a true story so that the viewer may understand how black people were treated in the past. The Negro Motorist Green Book, a guideline for black people's safety on the road, is an excellent illustration of how people thought in the past. The messages that this film conveys are very strong, especially in terms of friendship and the problem of racism, as can be seen.\n\nDespite the fact that the film deals with the extremely stressful and heavy topic of \"racism,\" it nonetheless has some comedy. To conclude, this is one of the greatest biographical films that I have seen so far, and I would suggest it to anybody who is interested in those topics or just want to see a film that has a fantastic mix of everything. Out of ten, I definitely give this film score of 9.5!",

A story about a relationship between black touring piano virtuoso Don Shirley and his white Italian bodyguard driver Tony Lip sounds relatively mundane on paper, but the movie is remarkably funny given its rather serious social setting of racial discrimination in 1960s America. The movie sends a clear message about the inhumanity of racial discrimination with its underpinnings of control and power and how human connection can transcend racial barriers, but it's the character Don Shirley's response to every racial slight that leaves an inspiring and lasting impression. The character chooses dignity above all else and suffers not only humiliation but also the pain of self-restraint. The movie ends on an uplifting note, but it is the quiet anguish of a dignified response in the face of oppression that will be remembered.",

I'd put this off for a long time, but this time the Random Film Generator gave me no choice, and I really tried to keep an open mind. But this is a clod-hoppingly cloying, naive, sometimes downright insulting racism drama that's elevated by two quite brilliant performances from Mahershala Ali (no coincidence that his Oscar was for Supporting Role rather than Leading ...) and Viggo Mortensen. They are in a different film altogether, one with grace notes, subtleties and intelligence that they must have mined from somewhere other than screenplay or direction. Recognition for the likes of Moonlight and Parasite in recent years don't make up for the elevation of this very ordinary film to heights and publicity it doesn't deserve (central performances aside), but they suggest that there may be some forward steps being taken. Sometimes. Meanwhile, if you must watch this, do so for the acting.",

We were able to empathize with Tony, who despite all his faults, still loves and does everything for his family, and for Shirley, an unparalleled skill that has become his gift and his curse.

Because of this dichotomy, he feels lost, belonging nowhere, on the one hand, being an educated person with values \u200b\u200btotally different from his peers, on the other, a black man, whom many white people despise.

But his depiction of Tony Vallelonga in this movie is really memorable, he slides into the role with the same ease as he digs into a bowl of homemade pasta and meatballs. A worldly wisdom, a straightforward honesty, and a strong moral code of a man who grew up in rough streets. Swift with the blunt fists and the sharp words alike. \nMahershala Ali as Shirley was also really well played, a man truly lost between worlds, belonging to none, with a blistering genius that only increases his isolation. One truly feels sorry for his self deprecating analysis as a puppet on strings, an erudite carnival showman, a bizarre exhibit surrounded by racism. \nThe lovely message of this movie is the ability of these two men to learn from each other, to embrace each other's world views, and in the end to valiantly rise in friendship and mutual respect. We could all learn from their journey, especially to never underestimate the knowledge and wisdom we can share to become better people.\nAs with any period piece I adored the authentic reproduction of a bygone \u2018simpler' age steeped in dark racism and hate. The nostalgia of the past is a dangerous thing when it whitewashes what really happened in sundown towns and plantations, even after the civil war.

The time period is depicted in a way that, compared to recently released media/films/series, is understated. The commentary on the treatment of the music prodigy-who happens to be black is depicted with dignity for the man and the way he still holds his head high in the face of ignorance and bullying. The audience, for obvious reasons, is immediately on his side but it's not beaten into them. This is also like the way being around Mr Shirley changes Lip and he learns to respect himself and a culture of people he previously stereotyped. When he is racially abused too he responds violently and he struggles to understand why Mr Shirley can stand it.  A Green book is something I didn't know existed and like other parts of the film serves to entertain, educate all without beating it into someone - this is cemented by the fact the \"true story\" information isn't even mentioned until the credits. Social commentary, fun scenes, music, chemistry  and humour. Very nice film.",

Here in Green Book, Viggo perfectly balances his set-in-his-ways machismo and finds new acceptance in a climate of adversity and blinkered minds.

He is invited to an interview with Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a black pianist in need of a driver for his eight-week concert tour through the Midwest and Deep South. Don hires Tony on the strength of his references. They embark with plans to return to New York City on Christmas Eve. Don's record label gives Tony a copy of the Green Book, a guide for African-American travelers to find motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve them. They begin the tour in the Midwest before eventually heading farther south. Tony and Don initially clash as Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act with more refinement, while Don is disgusted by Tony's habits. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano, and is increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment which Don receives from his hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. A group of white men beat Don and threaten his life in a bar and Tony rescues him. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour. Throughout the journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini), which deeply move her. Tony encourages Don to get in touch with his own estranged brother, but Don is hesitant, observing that he has become isolated by his professional life and achievements...\n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads: \"Green Book takes audiences on a surprisingly smooth ride through potentially bumpy subject matter, fueled by Peter Farrelly's deft touch and a pair of well-matched leads.\" Writing for The San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle praised Ali and Mortensen and said: \"...there's something so deeply right about this movie, so true to the time depicted and so welcome in this moment; so light in its touch, so properly respectful of its characters, and so big in its spirit, that the movie acquires a glow. It achieves that glow slowly, but by the middle and certainly by the end, it's there, the sense of something magical happening, on screen and within the audience.\" Steve Pond of TheWrap wrote, \"The movie gets darker as the journey goes further South, and as the myriad indignities and humiliations mount. But our investment in the characters rarely flags, thanks to Mortensen and Ali and a director who is interested in cleanly and efficiently delivering a story worth hearing.\"\n\n\"Green Book\" is inspired by the true story of a tour of the Deep South by African American classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley and Italian American bouncer Frank \"Tony Lip\" Vallelonga who served as Shirley's driver and bodyguard. The film received numerous accolades and nominations, and at the 91st Academy Awards, it won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Ali. Personally I think that \"Green Book\" is predictable and \"adjusted\" with a story we have seen before with an interracial friendship that develop a mutual exchange of perspectives and common grounds. I think as well that this topic is not served all too well in a \"comic\" package due to the direction by Peter Farrelly. I felt the same with Spike Lee\u00b4s \"BlacKkKlansman\". But, that\u00b4s my personal point of view as I think the topic is difficult and it is as current as ever and I want it to be taken more seriously. We do get some great moments between Ali and Mortensen. But, I was ultimately not blown away as many others were. But, cred for the nice 60s settings. And I do like Linda Cardellini.",

Em outras palavras, podemos compreender muito bem o que est\u00e1 acontecendo com os mesmos.\n\nJ\u00e1 no inicio, o filme deixa bem claro que Tony \u00e9 racista - e pela atitude dele, n\u00e3o \u00e9 pouco. Tamb\u00e9m fica claro que boa parte da sua fam\u00edlia te essa conduta, e a conviv\u00eancia com eles apenas gera uma super bolha, qual ele est\u00e1 prestes a sair. Quanto ao Dr. Shirley, seu desenvolvimento acontece de maneira mais lenta e progressiva. As situa\u00e7\u00f5es que o mesmo passa s\u00e3o absurdas, e em pouco tempo nos habituamos no ambiente predominantemente racista que a obra se passa. Com o tempo, as posi\u00e7\u00f5es de Shirley ficam mais claras, e o embate entre os dois se torna bem interessante. \u00c9 indiscut\u00edvel que come\u00e7amos com maus olhos no que se diz respeito ao Tony, mas alguns pontos que o mesmo levantou foram interessant\u00edssimos. Toda a tragediaria que eles passaram fez com que Tony finalmente pudesse enxergar as coisas de uma maneira diferente, saindo da bolha que ele sempre esteve. Shirley tamb\u00e9m tem uma evolu\u00e7\u00e3o significativa, com reflex\u00f5es relacionadas ao pr\u00f3prio povo dele. J\u00e1 no final da obra, temos uma cena de desabafo onde o ator \"Mahershala Ali\" que foi t\u00e3o intensa a ponto de percebermos que aquilo transcende uma linha de dialogo. Aquelas palavras s\u00e3o algo que ele passa ou j\u00e1 passou, e isso deu uma intensidade absurda a cena, que por si s\u00f3, tecnicamente, foi muito bem constru\u00edda. Lembro de ficar todo arrepiado, e outra cena que me provocou o mesmo foi a primeira vez que o vi tocar.\n\nEm decorr\u00eancia das situa\u00e7\u00f5es humilhantes que o Shirley passou, o diretor teve a brilhante ideia de refletir aquele peso no modo como Dr. tocava seu piano. A musica \u00e9 a mesma, mas o tom, a raiva e todos os sentimentos que vem junto eram completamente diferentes. Outro contrate interessante foi na cena onde ele toca um g\u00eanero predominante na cultura negra, mas que o mesmo ignorara por conta da sua distancia com os mesmos. O momento que ele sobe no palco do bar e toca o que sabe \u00e9 uma das minhas cenas favoritas desse filme. E logo ap\u00f3s, v\u00ea-lo tocar com a banda presente no momento foi divertid\u00edssimo.\n\nO final foi demasiadamente satisfat\u00f3rio, e ele ainda me faz acreditar em determinadas pessoas.\n\nSe tratando de aspectos t\u00e9cnicos, a fotografia \u00e9 bem elegante, rendendo v\u00e1rios frames dignos. A atua\u00e7\u00e3o de Mahershala Ali eu j\u00e1 mencionei acima. Quanto a de Viggo Mortensen... sinto que houve uma grande inspira\u00e7\u00e3o no estilo do Robert De Niro, mas isso n\u00e3o me incomodou. Ele manda bem no papel, parecendo bem habituado naquilo. A mixagem de som t\u00e1 excelente, devo mencionar. E quanto aos momentos c\u00f4micos, eles me pegaram. Funcionam quase sempre, me rendendo \u00f3timas gargalhadas.",

            "content": "In Green Book, actor Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) is hired as a chauffeur for musician Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) after the Copacabana club shuts its doors. People, especially the ones at the Oscars, overcompensate the themes of racism and bigotry into this movie, when really it's anything but. Instead, it's your typical run-of-the-mill story about two polar opposites that at first bite each other and they turn up as friends in the end. While Peter Farrelly, Brian Currie and Nick Vallelonga sneak in the two motifs in the movie, Green Book tells its formulaic story like a race-swapped Driving Miss Daisy. However, when the 1960's racist politics pop up, it can be uncomfortably forced, like the \"I'm not like most black people\" moment where Shirley eats KFC for the first time. I guess this act is a symbol of friendship, but I just groan when the movie tries too hard to be anti-racist. Then again, I'm watching a movie titled after the African American segregation tour books at the time, so I guess I shouldn't complain too much. Then, there's this Planes, Trains and Automobiles moment in the end where Shirley arrives at Tony's place for his Christmas Eve party because Shirley's all alone in Carnegie Hall. With him being a famous person of his time, I can't help but strongly doubt that nobody in New York City would make a solitary attempt to throw a party for him, especially with all his trials and tribulations in the South. Despite its efforts, Green Book had unoriginal storylines, forced racial pandering to easy-to-please audiences, and a sappy Hollywood execution. \n\n(2 Jade Stones out of 5)",

Intelligent movie, great dialogues and scenes! It is very relatable and down to earth.

I do not think this movie was made to be an anthem or to tell us everything about racial issues in the US. It is not a philosophical document - it is a story based on facts about two man who become friends for the rest of their lives, despite strong cultural and social barriers. The chemistry that developed between the main two characters is the essence of this movie. This is the message that we need nowadays. Just two individuals becoming more sensitive and understanding to problems of others and who can count on each other when facing troubles or dangers. \nWe do not need big institutions or big heads to fix the world. We only need to be like these two guys shown in this movie. Brotherhood among millions is almost impossible, but brotherhood between two souls is not only achievable but it is probably the strongest type of bond that can unite people of different races. There is a place in history for people like Luther King but everyday life circles around stories like this one. Law or institutional changes can only achieve so much but the real change happens at much lower level, in the heart of every man. It is not possible to truly love millions of people or to have meaningful relationship with them all but it is possible to find a soul mate in one person if we look outside of our social bubble. \nThat message is very powerful and much underestimated or ignored by so called critics.",

On the one hand, it has really funny moments without any banality, but on the other hand, it has a really deep and thought-provoking plot. I've listened about this film so many times and had a fear that this film will be overrated, but I really erred \u2013 the film is brilliant! I want to mark the picture and setting of the film in particular. The music is splendid and well-chosen. It has an especial atmosphere that makes to feel that time. \nThe director was inspired by the true story of two people: African American classical and jazz pianist Don Shirley and Italian American bouncer Frank Vallelonga that accompanied Don as driver and bodyguard in a tour to the Deep South. They had a lot of obstacles by way of disrespectful relations toward Don Shirley. And of course we see how characters change during their tour. The first person becomes simpler as a man but more respectful toward himself and the second person becomes more respectful toward others.\nThanks to outstanding cast \"Green Book\" became so realistic and so unparalleled. Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen were really perfect and played in their characters as good as it was possible. \nI don't want to tell you all the details, but I think that it's worth seeing, because the film makes to think about those who are successful, because for their smile and glory they can hide humiliation and bore their misfortunes bravely.",

The black person, in southern states, had few rights until the landmark civil rights bills of 1964-65.  This film shows us some of milder white reaction to black people.

Only one song, \"Slow Twistin'\" by Chubby Checker is reminiscent of 1962.

(b) Acting: Do the actors disappear into their roles, or merely mouth a script like Bogart? (c) Direction: Does it show some inspiration, or is it just a recording of performances?

Nevertheless, the way Peter Farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one\".\n...\nThe year is 1962, and the film begins inside Copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip, an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact. Both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people. Although it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. Believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. It has been ages since I watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, I felt refreshed as though it renewed me.\n...\nThe contextualisation was imperative to build up each one's personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade. Comedy is present as well so that you won't be missing from genuine laughs. Everything appears to be perfectly balanced, even the role of secondary personages such as Tony's wife and the cheeky cards experience. I'm chuffed to bits!\n...\nOn the whole, the film \"Green Book\" is an exceptional example of the conception of a masterpiece without spending loads of money in production and without creating plenty of trifling scenarios.\n...\n(88/100)\n...\nIf you want to check out more on films, go to https://davidtejada210.wixsite.com/tpepage",

Surely, Hollywood can do better than this?\n\nHeavy emphasis on the question mark above.",

The concept of the \"Green Book,\" which was new to me, is fascinating. Viggo Mortensen as Tony \"Lip\" seemed a little too stereotypical of an Italian-American at first (think the first season of The Sopranos), but I thought he transitioned more smoothly as the film went on and really appreciated his performance by the end.

I liked that they didn't make the North/South divide a good/bad divide, as the first racist encounter was in Indiana \u2014 albeit, not directed to Dr. Shirley himself.

But caught it twice over Xmas on Showtime and it really ripped my heart out having been raised both in the north and south in the 60's-70's as a kid right after segregation - and as a Caucasian that was bussed to all black schools, which definitely taught me a lot as a child... plus living in Texas for 15 more years (bussing was in Memphis) - I'm just sad and sometimes ashamed at our society on the whole (or humanity) that such even segregation existed only 40-50 years ago. And obviously remnants still remain today. But as for this film, as the Rotten Tomatoes write up says; it takes viewers on a ride thru a very bumpy topic (topics actually) - But is a must see for those that struggle with understanding the Mason Dixon line and \"life in the south vs the north\". The premise is an amazing canvass in which to tell this story (and ultimately the moral to the story) - and whilst uncomfortable at times to watch, the director or writer takes you right to the edge, then slowly backs away without too much violence or unnecessary conflicts, yet you will feel it in your soul. Extremely well written and acted and while I don't know the actors - the ending and their performances were just amazing. So after seeing it for a 2nd time, I decided to research it more and was thrilled to see its high audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes. So I'm not alone in thinking this is a great film \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb  \n\nGiven the divided country and world we live in these days (2020) I think films like this (that are accurate/believable and in the end, all is well) offers hope when it seems we're all fighting daily and now internationally - and its just time for everyone to chill and realize there's more important things in life than careers or possessions or status. Our family and friends and stepping outside of our comfort zones and making the effort to mend bridges that were burnt decades ago - that definitely still need mending and this film is a great reminder of ways to help start healing some of those wounds - if even just one mans journey. It's hard to explain as I don't want to spoil the film - but think we all could use a large dose of forgiveness, empathy, compassion and most of all, forgiveness plus a better understanding of the larger world around us and that tolerance (or acceptance) of those different than us as this would go a very long way in laying down the first steps to a more peaceful and loving world.

The Italian protagonist most likely kept in his memory afterwards that there was this one black guy who wasn't like the others. I doubt he changed his attitude toward our black fellow citizens in general.\n\nAnd I have a great and lasting problem with the ridiculous title. The movie is not really about the experience of black people traveling through the south, it is about one white guy's introduction to this fact. Baaaaah. Watch it, sure. But I want very much a completely different story someday, with Mahershala Ali in the lead, that takes us through first hand what it was like to travel while black in the US deep South.

            "content": "Peter Farally's Green Book raised quite a few eyebrows (and set off a fair number of eye roles) when it won best picture at the Oscars. Audiences and critics have praised the film for its wit, humor, and committed lead performances, while detractors have accused it of being overly glib, and made disparaging comparisons to Driving Miss Daisy. In my humble opinion, the naysayers are mostly wrong. This isn't to say that Green Book is perfect, but I would consider it a very good movie.\n\nBoth Mortensen and Ali's performances are excellent, and together their chemistry is nothing short of incredible. As Tony Lip, Mortensen is rough, uncouth, and quick tempered, with a real mouth on him. And he's casually racist. Not the most likeable guy, at least until some of his employer's charm and smarts start to rub off on him. Mortensen makes the character work because he never sugar-coats who Tony is or tries too hard to make him likeable, but neither does he force the racism, turning him into a completely unlikable caricature.\n\nFor his part, Ali is keenly intelligent, sophisticated, semi-reserved, and just a bit eccentric as Don Shirley. He frequently brings a palpable frustration and annoyance, whether at ignorance and somewhat loose ethics of his new driver, or the less than ideal circumstances he finds himself in. But he always manages a level of self control befitting a man of his refinement. Well, nearly always. When the damn breaks and he lets loose it provides some of the movie's best emotional catharsis and deepest reflections on race and identity.\n\n And there are some very deep, frequently thought provoking, and often uncomfortable meditations on race and society, driven by some truly brilliant dialog. And as the movie goes on, they're increasingly inter-spaced with the lighthearted and genuinely heartwarming moments as the two men warm up to each other. There are some pretty funny moments, as seen in the trailer, and some truly wonderful music. Green Book is by no means a full on musical, but there's a lot of excellent piano playing, and a very fun blues performance towards the end.\n\nNow I'd like to address some of the criticisms of this film. \nDespite what some critics have said, Green Book doesn't fall into the White Savior trope. Yes, Tony pulls Doctor Shirley out of some jams. He literally saves him from a close call at a bar. But that's what actually happened. And Shirley pulls him out of some tough spots too. Nor does it succumb to the \"Magical Negro\" trope. Much of the movie does revolve around how Shirley helps Tony learn and grow as a person. But it's not a one-sided relationship. Both men learn new things, see new viewpoints, and get a better idea of who they are as a result of their interactions, and if Tony has more growth, that's because he had a lot more growing to do in the first place.\n\nIt is true that the movie doesn't spend a whole lot of time addressing Shirley's homosexuality.  But it's not like they leave it out or tiptoe around, and between issues of race and class Green Book already has plenty of worthy issues on its plate. The filmmakers were never setting out to make another Moonlight. Now I would have liked to see more of the actual Green Book and its contents, which only appear briefly. I also found a few bits here and there a tad slow, and and the first half had more cringy and awkward moments than I would have liked, though perhaps that was unavoidable.\n\nNo, Green Book didn't deserve best picture, and I have no idea what the people at the Globes were smoking when they awarded it best musical or comedy. But it's a satisfying road movie, a deservedly feel good story about race, and one of the better films of 2018.\n",

All the acting in this movie is very superb, as my favorite scenes in the movie came from this friendship between Tony Lip and Doctor Donald Shirley.  It was so fun and entertaining to watch these two characters grow together and look out for one another.  Some people complained about this movie not being totally accurate as the movie takes the segregation to a safe minimal.  The movie is PG-13 which I honestly thought was a smart choice.  This allows younger people to be able to watch the movie and still understand what the U.S. used to be like and how racism is wrong.  We don't always need rated R movies to tell us racism is bad, this movie can show everyone that it doesn't matter what skin color you have because we are all equal, and I thought that was really beautiful.  I do have to admit the beginning of the movie went a little slow for me.  I didn't like the opening sequence and didn't think it had much to do with the overall plot.  The movie really started getting good for me when we are first introduced to Dr. Shirley.  I also don't necessarily love the title.  The Green Book is something that appears in the movie a couple of times but didn't have the largest significance and didn't really have anything to do with the message they were going for.

            "content": "I'd heard rumblings from people, griping that some of the details may have been altered from the facts, that some events might have been slightly changed. And also, there was some talk that they made the white guy a bit more of a hero than he was in real life.\n\nWell, to be honest, for me, even if they did make those changes, I really didn't see that sort of 'white-washing' in this movie.\n\nSet in 1962, a classically-trained black pianist hires a white Italian from the Bronx to be his driver, and personal assistant during a concert tour of the deep south. Knowing there would be some trouble while dealing with racial tensions during the pre-civil rights era south, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) hires Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) to help navigate these tough waters.\n\nRight from the outset, we see these two couldn't be more different. Tony is a guy living on the periphery of organized crime in the Bronx, working at the Copacabana, and Dr. Shirley lives above a concert hall in a luxury apartment filled with statues, elephant tusks, and artwork from around the world.\n\nNow we've all seen movies like this before, and we know where the story is probably going to take us. We will head to the deep south, where Shirley will encounter racism, and Tony will be the hired muscle to help him through it. And they'll both learn a little something about each other along the way.\n\nBut there were a few things that make this movie extra special.\n\n1) Usually in movies featuring the black/white dynamic, it's the white guy who is the 'educated' one, and it's up to the black guy to show him just how uncool he is (Kevin Hart, I'm talking to you)...but in this movie, it was the other way around. It was the black character who is smarter, more refined, more learned, and has a lot to teach Tony about the world. So that was a nice change of pace.\n\nIt was also nice to see the two characters slowly embrace their differences. At first, Tony has the standard pushback. \"Ehhh, I don't need nobody to tell me how to use a napkin\". But he soon sees that maybe he has a little room to grow and improve. Same goes for Dr. Shirley. At first, he sees the guy in the driver's seat as this uncouth baboon, worthy of little more than snark and dismay, but ultimately there's something he could learn from him too.\n\n2) The performace of Mahershala Ali was something very special. The character of Dr. Shirley could have easily been a one-dimensional snob that goes nowhere fast...but there's an underlying fear and scared little child just under the surface of Ali's performance. He's someone who has lived on the edges of both the black and white world throughout his entire life. We also learn midway through that he's gay, so he's struggled in that world as well.\n\nHe has a brilliant line midway through the movie when Tony mocks his aloofness and says, \"hey I'm blacker than YOU!\" Dr. Shirley gets out of the car in an utter downpour and yells, \"So if I'm not black enough, and if I'm not white enough, and if I'm not man enough, then tell me Tony, what am I?!\"\n\nClearly Shirley has been dealing with this conundrum his entire life, but he had never shown that vulnerability before. He is someone who seems to have it all figured out, but in reality, he's confused and alone. It was a true moment of revelation, and something you don't normally see in movies like this. Usually it's just wacky comic mayhem where the uptight character tries on silly clothes, some stupid hillbillies chasin' em in a truck, and then roll the end credits. Ali gave the charater of Dr. Shirley some serious depth and pathos I was definitely not expecting.\n\n3) Viggo Mortensen, as usual, was brilliant as well. He could have easily just done a DeNiro/Danza impersonation and \"hey oh, oh, eyyyd\" is way through this character, but he really was a joy to behold. Not only does he have some great laugh lines as the street-wise gambino, but you see his slow evolution from a guy who's just about as racist as the Southern hicks they come across, to seeing Dr. Shirley as who he is. A man. But never in a schmaltzy, schticky way.\n\nAnd in regards to him being the 'hero'....he was hardly a hero. His job was to protect Dr. Shirley in the south (because hey, a black man traveling alone in the deep south in the 60s, no matter how heroic he wanted to be, would be up against impossible odds, so Dr. Shirley did indeed need some help.) But even then, Tony did as little as possible through a good chunk of the movie to \"help\" Dr. Shirley. He 'tolerated' him for most of the time, and their friendship slowly developed, but was never over the top or 'heroic\". It was very subtle, and for that, I was grateful. I didn't need to be hit over the head with a message, or big crisis-fueled revelations. Watching these two characters grow to like each other, either through letter writing, listening to Little Richard, or the joys of eating fried chicken with your fingers... was a joy.\n\nThere weren't any real surprises in this movie, just a good story, VERY well told.\n\nI'd love for this to win the Best Picture as it was easily my favorite movie of the nominees...but I don't think it will.\n\nBut then again, stories like this aren't told for awards. They are told to make us smile, make us think, and make us better people.\n\nAnd Green Book accomplishes all three.",

It is still very relevant and topical for our generation as racism still exists, even if it is more behind closed doors.

Ali is amazing as always and deserves bigger roles, he continues to shine as the support, even though he has a central presence like Washington. 24/05/2019",

When you think about the fact that this lost to Roma, is in the same club as films like Moonlight and even fared better than La La Land, Arrival and so many other deserving films, I'm only reminded of just how much of a joke \"award seasons\" can really be.\n\nI've read a lot of other reviews and it seems that a lot of people loved the feel-good moments. Well, good for you, but unfortunately I didn't think much of it was comedic or touching at all. Yet whatever else you may argue, you cannot tell me you didn't cringe a single bit watching that fried chicken scene. I mean, in the trailer it didn't seem that bad, but then you just get Viggo Mortensen forcing Mahershala Ali repeatedly as if the cool kid is being pressured to not look \"foolish\". What could have been decent and respectful comedy turned into something so uncomfortable for which Peter Farrelly should be utterly ashamed of. The worst part was that he then tells him he's not black enough? That turned my discomfort into anger. WTF were the writers thinking? \n\nPersonally, I want to make it clear that I'm the kind of guy who can forgive white-savior tropes where the film is well-written, filled with great performances, and yet still most importantly, doesn't cross the line. The Help and Hidden Figures are two examples of white-savior tropes which at least for me, managed to entertain and yet never went the offensive route. But this movie is just a whole different ball game. It's not only crossed the line but also manages to be a structural and technical mess. The first 30 minutes are really near useless,  and the story bumps around so many things to make it sound more complicated. It was like they were running through a checklist of themes they had to cover in different sections of the film to make it Oscar-worthy. There's black identity, isolation, dignity and social status, and then that ONE standalone scene on sexual identity, but they never come together under the hands of a director with no central vision. So what does he do to cover up his weaknesses? He puts together that touching ending to make us feel all good inside as we walk out the theater. The result is that even Mortensen and Ali's great performances were in my opinion heavily diminished to characters with character developments so misfired, unengaging and inconsistent.\n\nI'm not the most eloquent person, but I just needed some sort of medium to express my anger that such a film got made in the first place, and so I hope you get my point!",

Their differences are very fun. Don is the one who is well read and has manners, yet he's looked down upon because of his race and Frank is kind of in the opposite boat. I also enjoyed Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga) in her smaller supporting role. The writing is very well done, as the characters are given strong moments to let their personalities shine and the dialogue is natural and sharp. There's a lot of charm to almost everything that happens.\n\nWeaknesses: There are some pacing issues here. Some scenes feel like they go on a bit long and others seem like they aren't needed. This could've been cut down to about 110 minutes and probably been tighter. I'm not big on Peter Farrelly as a director. None of his work has ever impressed me and I don't think he did anything to stand out in this one.

Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali had proven themselves to be Academy favorites in the past, Mortensen has received multiple nominations whilst Ali won for his work in 2016's Moonlight, but their pairing seemed unlikely. Despite all of this and early predictions that Roma would take the prize Green Book triumphed.\n\nTony \"the lip\" Vallellonga, Viggo Mortensen, is a racist Italian-American in 1950s New York City who is encouraged to question his prejudices when he begins working for educated African-American pianist Don Shirley, Mahershala Ali. Shirley needs a driver and bodyguard as he tours the Southern United States and he has been told that Vallellonga is the man for the job. Both will overcome their preconceptions of one another and learn a little something about themselves as they take a comedic road trip through a dangerous part of America. \n\nI quite liked the film, it was funny and charming and the performances of Mortensen, Ali and Linda Cardellini as Mrs. Vallellonga were very good but would I call it better than The Favorite? Well no. It's perfectly OK but it does employ the white savior trope that I hoped we had moved beyond with films like Moonlight (2016) and in the same year If Beale Street Could Talk (2018). It makes you question the demographic makeup of the Academy when a film like this, which would have been illuminating to some members of society in the late 1960s but 50 years later if you can't acknowledge that African-Americans have just as much to offer as white people you are racist not uninformed. It's nice that the highly accomplished actress Octavia Spencer is now an Academy award winning producer but it's saddening that this and The Help (2011), a worse white savior trope movie, are the films that she has been most rewarded for. \n\nIn short: this is a film that you don't really have to see, much like Darkest Hour (2017) just watching the trailer allows you to understand what the whole two hours will be like. Unless you're a Cardellini fan you can stay away.\n\nSome of the gags work really well with the fried chicken scene and the dropping of the cup eliciting a half smile but some of them fall flat like the pronunciation of Vallellonga gag, is it really that hard to pronounce? The gag that really worked for me was the card writing gag as we see Shirley composing romantic letters for Mrs. Vallellonga that she and her friends eagerly await. The card that means the most to her is the one written by her husband as he starts the letter with \"You remind me of a big house\" but follows this with \"Where the lights are always on and everybody is happy inside.\" His writing of this and her delighted response are very sweet and touching and although it is a very heavy-handed touch, like much of this film, it feels more genuine than most of the film.\n\nLinda Cardellini is quite lovely in this film as the reasonable wife who endeavors to bring her husband and Shirley closer together. She has a warmth and a sensibility to her that matches the description of the character and you are often left wondering how Vallellonga nabbed such a wonderful woman. Much like in The Founder (2016), a much better film, she is always a bright spot when she appears on screen and her sparing use leaves you wanting more of her. It is such a shame that the Daddy's Home franchise has become her meal ticket because she has real dramatic abilities and they would be put to use in better films.\n\nThis was not the best film of 2018 and I would not have even nominated it for Best Picture but of the nominated films I would have given the award to Roma because it is a technical marvel. Hopefully we can leave this sort of film behind and reward more interesting fare in the future.",

Dr. Don Shirley ( a talented, black, pianist of a more posh status) whom meets Tony when he applies for a job. A job that would change his life in thee best way possible. From the heart of Peter Farrelly comes friendship, hardships and life lessons. I love the ever growing bond between Dr. Shirley and Tony throughout the whole film. How Tony begins this story as a sceptic and a bit of a racist, ending in acceptance for this magnificent man and how he finally learns that skin colour is but a coating of a human being. It is not what defines us. And we are thrilled to see him realise this and come to terms with it. The dialogue is very clever! Cracking subtle and not so subtle jokes here and there keeps the audience breathless with laughter. The Green Book also brings our attention to racism in the 1930's. How such a simple thing as walking into a building could cost you your pride and dignity just for the colour of your skin. It also reflects to modern days and how there are still Tony's all around the world who are unable to accept people no matter their nationality or their origin. If only the whole world had the wholesome bond that Tony and Dr. Shirley had in the end.",

You really watch it to see these two great actors play their characters and interact to all situations differently. There is one extra twist here with one of the characters that I don't see much when it comes to these movies. It's basically a road trip through the \"Deep South\" in the 1960s with two men (one Italian American, one African American) with different education and upbringing but  they themselves are different in those worlds as well. Not a \"must see\" film but also does deserve it's academic praise. FINAL REVIEW: 7.5 out of 10",

The real story is the development of their relationship as the barriers of communication break down in their confrontations of obstacles on their own and together based on the paths they have chosen. Mahershala Ali (Dr. Don Shirley) and Viggo Mortenson (Tony Lip), each with an effortless Oscar-worthy genuineness, portray the characters in this true story - the unexpected intimacy between a highly educated, highly gifted gay African-American and a born and bred \u00e2family-style\u00e2? NYC cugino with a grammar school education. In the Q and A after the film, Farrell, Ali, and Mortenson shared my personal take away - the hope that the film will inspire an open dialogue for a \u00e2listening\u00e2(TM) relationship about racial and sexual prejudices that still exist today. The car metaphor demonstrates that we need to take the time to \u00e2listen\u00e2?. The film shows us that if people are informed they will do the right thing, and when they are not informed, they become hostages to their prejudices. Kris Bowers, composer, deserves grand applause.",

There is a lot of power in a film that leaves things unsaid, and this is not that film. It just felt a bit inelegant sometimes.\n\nThis is just me being picky, though. I guess I watched it through a 'should this have won Best Picture' lens. The other thing is that I suppose I expected that a movie like this, that just won Oscars, would have something new, interesting and/or monumental to say about racism. And it really doesn't.

Cruising along the back roads and highways in a curvy blue Cadillac DeVille, the pair quickly dispenses with the pleasantries to share a few essential truths, each giving as much as they take. They rankle and irritate, an odd couple on wheels against the backdrop of a volatile social change, but through several close shaves and heated arguments, they develop a mutual admiration despite their fundamental differences.\n\nMostly a two-man show, Green Book thrives on the performances of Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, who enrich twin roles that could have otherwise fallen into broad generalizations. The life and depth they bring to both individuals, and to their complicated friendship, make for more than just a standard morality play. It's also an impressively restrained turn for director Peter Farrelly, better known for his work with brother Bobby in a series of zany '90s comedies. He lets the tone set itself, resisting the urge to bludgeon us with the message, and sprinkles in a few solid laughs when the moment calls for it. A well-made and effective, if overly safe, best picture winner.",

He's faced with a hard realization of the cruelty Ali's character has to live with every day and learns that when you're Black in the deep south, talent means absolutely nothing. His progression from racist thug to accepting and even defending Doc is tear inducing.\n\nDoc is played perfectly. Though he strikes you as snotty, you begin to understand why he's standoffish. As he becomes more comfortable with Tony, he let's his guard and begins to help Tony learn to speak, write, and carry himself better.\n\nThe two are incredible together because they both have lessons to learn. They both must grow, and the film does a wonderful job of showing that growth both personally and with relation to their friendship.\n\nThere are parts of the film that will be upsetting and you should be upset and outraged. There are parts of the film that are funny, and you should laugh. And with all of this combined, you still learn that this film expertly blends the two contrasting emotions into an overall enjoyable film.",

The director really has a low opinion of it's audiences intellect, that is for certain.  But then, perhaps this type of film is intended as an introduction film to the prejudice  among us who may be ready to start dealing with the harsh realities of our not to distant History here in America.  Still though, something is better than nothing as it were.  If this type of remedial cinema experience is at least starting a conversation with those who can't handle far better examples of this subject matter, so be it!  Some of us have to start somewhere I suppose.  For me, a \"feel good\" movie that attempts to portray racism is simply unacceptable in 2019.",

            "content": "First of all, the acting in this done by both Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen was amazing. Mahershala Ali got all the awards for his performance as Don Shirley and you can see why. They easily contracted each other in more than one ways. This helps to show that opposites really do attract in both friendships and relationships. Throughout the film, you can see both actors giving it their all in every scene they are in. Both characters in this film have character development that is perfect for their character. This is because both of them teach the other something and help them grow as a person. Whether it be Tony teaching Shirley how to loosen up a bit or Shirley teaching him how to write letters. This film isn\u00e2(TM)t afraid to show how in the 1960s racism was very prominent and how we still face that in this day and age. While watching this film you notice how things that happen back then still happen now and wonder why that is. Even though they do take this subject matter seriously like they should they also throw in a bit of humor in well-placed scenes that helps not take it away from the serious topic it\u00e2(TM)s dealing with. This film is two hours and ten minutes and you don\u00e2(TM)t feel it. Really even though I don\u00e2(TM)t say it that much I kinda wish it was a tiny bit longer. Nothing in this film felt rushed and felt at the speed it should be going at. There are a few scenes that I would\u00e2(TM)ve cut but not that many. In the end, this is a film that I think everybody should check out at least once. Whether just to learn about this interesting story about two friends who defied the odds or just a movie to watch. I give Green Book a 10/10.",

Extremely boring and lacking in a connection with its main characters. Neither character really had any huge problems with the others race, they were basically pretty open-minded with some small reservations. Nothing earth-shattering here.. So I really don\u2019t see the big deal about how their \u201cfriendship \u201c developed...I wanted to like it because of the cast, but definitely not one that stirred any emotion in me.

Green Book is a really well done biographical comedy drama film about a true story of a Jamaican classical jazz pianist and his personal driver going on a road trip tour to some of the rough parts of the country during the time of racial segregation. It is a good story. Almost like a road trip buddy comedy. With two opposite people. The jazz pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) is a high class Jamaican American and has a condo of many expensive furniture and antiques. The bouncer/driver Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) is an Italian American and struggling to make money to support his family. He is a loud foul mouth, blunt, a chain smoker, and eats a lot. He even put himself in a bet in an eating competition to make some money. The plot follows Tony when he loses his job in a night club cause of renovation. He gets an interview from Dr. Don Shirley. Tony is a bit of a racist. When he sees two African Americans doing some plumbing work in his apartment and his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) serves them a drink. After they set their glasses in the sink. Tony grabs the glasses and throws them out in the trash. When Shirley recruits Tony to be his driver for this music tour. Which would set him away from his family for two months. Tony and Shirley will have a lot to go over about each other. Shirley is proper and mannered. Tony is the complete opposite. It is one of those heartfelt stories. Yes, it does have some difficult scenes to watch during the racial segregation when Don Shirley gets denied to use the whites bathroom or eat in a public restaurant with the rest of the people. Or when he is given a closet of a room to get ready for the concert. Sure, Tony does not take that likely and react poorly by knocking whoever is rude to the guy out. There is some character development with Tony and Don becoming friends throughout the movie and are able to tolerate each other. Don trying fast food restaurants with Tony. It is fun to see Tony and Don react to each other on screen. From being the people who can not stand one or another to being close friends throughout the road trip journey. Viggo Mortensen was great playing Tony. With the gaining weight for the role and an Italian accent. Mahershala Ali was also great playing Don Shirley who is prim and proper with his mannerisms. Linda Cardellini playing Tony's loving wife, who is set more aside on the screen time. Waiting at home and writing to her husband. Overall, Green Book is a really good film. It does have a heartfelt emotional true story about Tony and Don Shirley. It does have some fun humor that will make you laugh and some tough emotional moments. The performances are great.",

He\u2019s too \u201ccultured\u201d to fit in the black community, and, well, too black to fit in the white community. Viggo might fit into his family and those that love him, but he\u2019s a fish out of water in the \u201ctough guy\u201d Italian underworld his skills are suited for.

I truly enjoy this movie and if it wasn't for the predictability of the film and the stereotypes and delineation of the plot along those two basis's, I would have given it a perfect score. But the movie is choreographed and sometimes formulaic, especially in terms of character personalities. It's one of my favorites nonetheless and I think it's a minor criticism that would be almost impossible to avoid, following the story, but it is not the perfect plot to the perfect movie that I give a perfect rating for.",

There's a line where Don Shirley explains that he performs for white people to feel cultured but afterwards he's just another black man on the streets to them. And in a way, that kind of feels like what this film is. Lighthearted, easy themes for specific demographics of white people to feel involved in a conversation, but there are much more insightful conversations similar to this in a lot of recent African American made films that completely overshadow it.",

I really enjoyed the scene in the bar but that was a character climax and very different from a climax of tension.",

This is not the case with this working class, unsophisticated, loud, tough guy bigot. Mortensen hits every note required by his role; there\u00e2(TM)s just not a lot to his character. Still, in the tradition of nominating great actors for their most mediocre roles, the Academy has nominated Mortensen for Best Actor.\n\nThe same goes for Mahershala Ali as Dr. Don Shirley. There should be a lot for his character to work with: being an educated, sophisticated, and successful black musician playing high profile venues and exclusive parties in the Jim Crow South. He is ostensibly the guest of honor at the private parties of wealthy high society people but they will not let him use their bathroom. He should be the lead character and we should feel his inner struggles and emotions beyond him just trying to remain dignified. Instead, Dr. Shirley is a reserved, private, and lonely person which is a pretty good excuse for a white screenwriter to not have to get into the head of a black character. All that is required of Don Shirley is to be serious, refined, dignified, and, most of all, be unamused by Tony\u00e2(TM)s shenanigans. Ali won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role in Moonlight, and he is nominated for Supporting Actor again, but, as with Viggo, this is nowhere near his best work. Ali delivers what his underwritten role requires, but having an actor like him play this part is like having his character play chopsticks.\n\nGreen Book gets its title from the real-life travel guide published for black motorists during segregation so they could find a restaurant, gas station, or hotel that would accept them without trouble. This book is barely used in the movie. You would expect it to play a larger part since it is what the movie is named after. Green Book presents itself as a story about race and class, but really it is a mismatched buddy road trip movie. The problem is that is not good at being either. Will the laid back, sloppy guy and the serious, neat guy drive each other crazy? I'll admit I laughed at some of the gags and jokes, but the punchlines are not original.\n\nMortensen and Ali work well together but there\u00e2(TM)s not enough to make their characters or their relationship feel like something you haven\u00e2(TM)t seen a dozen times before in other movies that deal with race and friendship. This is a just a recital not trying to be anything new. By the time Tony and Don are racing back to New York to make it home in time for Christmas dinner I had gone giddy from an overdose of clich\u00c3 (C)s. Will Green Book make you feel good and provide two hours of inoffensive, unchallenging entertainment? Maybe, but when you can predict every beat and every scene what\u00e2(TM)s the point of watching? There are high quality actors, costumes, and production design but ultimately Green Book is nothing more than a big budget Hallmark Channel Hall of Fame movie.",

I also really liked the characters' very funny interactions and both performances are so good with Viggo Mortensen stealing the show.

Green Book is what I would call one of the best films of the year, if not the last decade. The story itself follow a mid-aged Italian man hired to drive a black piano player around the southeastern part of the country for his musical tour. This movie shows a great way to bring up the subject of stereotyping and racial division. It is also a great way to show how people can be bonded together by things other than race in a time like the sixties. Both the main characters were from around the area of New York and the Bronx, which was still and still is very divided from the immigration boom of the Twenties. So, for a man like our main character to take this job was very unlikely. When he did though, each character both taught each other things from both sides of the spectrum. One taught a way to speak with the New York style slang and cursing. The other taught a more laid back of living without having to be completely perfect or worried about doing it right. Overall, Green Book is a great buddy film showing to people building an unlikely friendship that will help them defend each other, no matter the consequences. This is a quaint little flick that I believe even a younger mature audience can enjoy on any night that you need a good rental.",

I think anyone would agree that this movie is like watching a re-mastered version of \u00e2Driving Miss Daisy\u00e2? with much focus on the recent changes.\nTimes were simpler back in 1989 when \u00e2Driving Miss Daisy\u00e2? was released and the focus was only on the story and relationship between a Jewish women and Black driver. But in almost three decades\u00e2(TM) focus became less and less towards the story and more on \u00e2How to force the academy members to vote for this movie?\u00e2?. \nMovie spills its beans way too early and even with that pace, every single step is predictable. Even upcoming scenes could be predicted with exact timing and words. Either writers wanted to stick to the real story too much or they wanted to not show anything to antagonize either color. And as a product of their effort, the output was mediocre.\nAs far as acting goes, Mahershala Ali is on average. Beside one scene, his acting looks like an effort. For a person like me who has seen him for several years, on House of Cards giving a brilliant performance before he became famous, his portrayal was a huge let down. His effort was visible but he resisted taking risk. Viggo Mortensen on the other hand was closer to the character he was playing. He did not come up with the sharp Italian ascent we\u00e2(TM)d expect since God Father but his body language was very impressive. Ironically, Viggo was nominated for a similar role 11 years ago for \u00e2Eastern Promises\u00e2?.\nThe Green Book is not a bad movie and definitely not a bad idea, but it sure was wasted to milk the recent black cow.",

But once he spends time with dr shirley he stops being racist. he understands more. he stands up for what he knows to be true. and now the he knows racism is wrong he stands up to it. \n\nMahershala ali was great as usual, but also as predictable as usual. there is nothing he can do that would surprise me. that being said,the level of genuiness he brings to his characters where i think another stoic type actor would bring is brilliant. its just stoicism for stoicism sake. not in the moments that arent tense. not every moment is tense and stoic. some are happy and stoic or chill and stoic. \n\ngreat script. great lines. i loved the line \"the world is filled with lonely people too afraid to make the first move.\" incredible line. incredible.",

You know the movie when the main actors who are black and white hate each other first then they somehow become best friends? yeah, that exactly what I got from the trailer. And I only watched the trailer because I saw the actor Mahershala Ali. Mahershala is an amazing actor who I fell in love with his work from one of the best movies I have ever seen, Moonlight.  After watching Moonlight, I have tried to watch everything with him in it. so, by default, I gave this movie a chance.\n\nWhile watching this movie I had no expectations AT ALL. There was a lot of negative buzz around this movie for numerous reasons. But, I am glad I decided to watch the movie because I learned a bit of history I never knew. Me being a History minor student learning history every chance I get is always a plus. Before watching this movie I had no idea what a \u00ef\u00bf 1/2Green Book\u00ef\u00bf 1/2\u00c2? or the significance of it. This movie opened my eyes to so much.\n\nWhen watching the movie I didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t take into account that many of these events were based on true events. I definitely did after the movie because this is when I really do my deep thinking on movies. There is a particular restaurant scene that made me understand the circumstances of many African Americans of this time. The scene is when Dr. Don is about to perform at this restaurant but he decides to eat with his band first at the same restaurant. Dr. Don was actually told he was not allowed to eat at the SAME restaurant he was about to perform at because COLOREDS weren\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t allowed. isn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t that some bullshit? so while his band who is white were eating Dr. Don was not even allowed to be in the same room as them.\n\nAll in all, the movie was good, not great. The acting was magnificent. The message was clear but, not exactly executed as such. I learned a lot from this movie so for that reason, I would recommend. The movie does start off slow so it will take an effort to continue watching. Lastly, when watching take into account this movie was set in 1962 and that was not so long ago.",

Telling the story of a racist Italian driver that arranges a job of a renowned black musician. The drama of the film is inspired by facts and is good, but the solutions of script are weak and end up leaving the average film. Script options, how to expose Tony's racism is silly, has no depth and meaning, is made solely and exclusively to cause empty aversion to the viewer, and opt for a line of script that follows in every movie, we have the discussion, the problem, the resolution and the moral lesson, such a set of events are repeated throughout the film without any news, which ends up leaving the work extremely predictable beyond its last scene, which I like for the good feeling that it cause, but it diverges from the movie message, which is good, but poorly executed.\nBut not everything is hurt. Viggo Mortessen is very cool in his character, a raw Italian, the actor seems to have fun in making a mega canastr\u00c3\u00a3o character, and that suits him a lot, you perfectly buy the character. And Mahershala there is great again, bringing us a dubious and confused character with his ideas, a deep character with troublesome feelings and veiled veils in a layer of coldness, and Ali's performance restrains this to perfection.\nAnother cool point is Peter's focused direction, with great set compositions, a bluish photograph and good use of the cameras, the director drives his film well, nothing exceptional and the only technical mistakes are associated with script mistakes. \"Green book\" does not enchant, but it is a legal film, mainly on account of its protagonists.",

The chemistry between the actors is undeniable, delivering an unique portrayal of friendship.

This is also wonderfully shot and directed by Peter Farrelly who I have never seen a better film made from him before and I really can not understand why he has not been nominated for best director. This is a tale of a True friendship which the to are complete opposites which Maheshela Ali is a great Piano player but is quite a lonely, quite man and Viggo Mortensen is quite a load ,friendly family man who is Mahershala Ali's driver to take him on tour to venues that he will be will be performing at. Mahershala gets stopped in a lot of places like Restaurants and even one of the events he is performing at he gets told to use the separate toilet outside the venue this is because the film was set in the 1960's were there was still a lot of racism going. This certainly builds their relationship and on the journey builds a great friendship which I don't think could have been played by any better actors. Overall I think this is a flawless film which I wouldn't mind winning Best Picture and I would love to see what Peter Farrelly does next.",

But all that is the substrate or skin that harbors its most precious quality: the ability of the best men to recognize a weak personal emotional position when it is pointed out to them in the purest fraternal context of love. And to take that new knowledge, that recognition, and trade up. To remake a part of themselves that better serves their lives and those around them, within the context of unspoken love expressed by the best possible choices of action and words, gestures, and at times even by the withdrawal from another who needs the space and solitude to heal. Everything beautiful here benefited from close proximity to things so brutal and ugly, most of us would steer clear of them. That is one of the great powers of good storytelling.

Driving Miss Daisy already covered this topic in reverse.\n\nViggo Mortensen, an Italian American? Really? I like the guy, but he was totally miscast and he over did everything. It was almost like a bunch of Italian caricatures of Italians in movies, but not real life. It was like Peter Farrelly watched the Sopranos and then copied the behavior from that. If you wanna see authentic Italian-American movies there are plenty to choose from like the obvious, Godfather, Mean Streets, Goodfellas just to name a few.\n\nAlthough this isn't a gangster movie, it had those elements in there, but they all felt totally phony. Then an \"Africa King\" living on top of Carnegie Hall. Really? Is this Black Panther?\n\nLet's ignore all the totally unbelievable scenes like the fight in the Copa and everyone just pretends nothing is going on, like band keeps playing etc. That he throws away glasses BECAUSE two black guys drank from them, but then 2 minuter later he has no problem working intimately with a black man. Really? He went from irate racist to civil rights advocate in a few minutes after turning down a gig for the Italian guys. Turning down gigs while selling his property to stay alive. Then his mingling with other black drivers and having fun, totally ignoring the original set up of him a staunch racist.. Really? On top of being a staunch racist\" he constantly listened to black music and knew all about it. Really?\n\nSorry, no genuine racist would drive for a black guy in the south. Not buying that part of it. And no black guy that was that \"proper\" and insisting on classy behavior would ever hire a low-class guy like. None of it rang true.\n\nIt was written like it all took place today using language like \"traveling while black.\" Really?\n\nMahershala Ali is just an overrated actor. No one speaks like that and he totally missed the REAL Don Shirley gay/flamboyant fasting talking large personality behavior.\n\nThe whole time I'm waiting I'm waiting for the obligatory \"pulled over by racist cops\" scene. Of course it came. That always has to be part of every woke movie.\n\nThe movie was idiotic.. I didn't buy for one second anything that happened.",

We see the characters bond as the stuffed shirt Ali learns to eat fried chicken with his hands and the inarticulate Mortensen learns to write romantic letters to his wife. Ali has moments of humiliation that he rises above with dignity that we have seen countless times before.There are similarities to \"Driving Miss Daisy\" as a portrayal of a prejudiced white person who learns to become more tolerant so the audience can congratulate themselves for their racial enlightenment. The title comes from \"The Negro Motorist Green Book,\" a guidebook for how African-American travelers can navigate segregated America in the mid-20th Century. The title has been appropriated for a phony racial reconciliation conclusion. This material would have been more compelling had it been the musician's story. The performances by Mortensen, and particularly, by Ali are what sustains our interest. Directed by Peter Farrelly, best known for doing outrageous comedies with his brother, doesn't have the same kind of talent for serious drama.

            "content": "Director Peter Farrelly is certainly best known for his big-hearted, light comedies; from Dumb and Dumber to There's Something About Mary, Farrelly has shown himself to be a sure hand at the genre. His new film, Green Book, employs much of the same warm comedy, but along with a far more dramatic narrative.\nGreen Book is the (though now debatably) true story of Italian-American bar bruiser, Tony \"Lip\" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen), who finds work as a driver for a renowned black pianist, Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) as he embarks on a concert tour across the Deep South. The film explores the growing friendship of the two men against the ugly backdrop of segregated America.\nThere is plenty of fun to be had in Green Book; as expected of Farrelly, there's an effortless charm to the film, supported by belly-laughing humour and spirited characters. The script is occasionally a little clunky, but what truly ensures the success of Green Book is its performances (both Oscar noms). Viggo Mortensen leads as Tony, a big-mouthed big eater, impressively humorous but also adding an emotive touch to a role that could have easily seemed like a caricature. There is a huge heart to Mortensen's lively performance that is somewhat captivating. This is played off nicely by Mahershala Ali, on usual expert form as Dr Shirley. Ali's composure and poise lend his performance this quiet gravitas that seems to find its true culmination in the film's most powerful scene, as Tony and Don argue in the rain as two minorities unaccepted in 1960s America. \nIt seems a shame, however, that the aforementioned scene is the closest that Green Book gets to really addressing its subject. The racial themes of the film are swiftly glossed over for the most part, even from the beginning where we see an apparently prejudiced Tony dispose of the drinking glasses of two black workmen, only to be seen happily kneeling on the ground playing dice with a group of African Americans some twenty minutes later. The film doesn't just discuss race; class and sexuality are also lingering themes, but both feel all too briefly mentioned. There are certain scenes that do tackle the issues head on and I loved those moments, but much of the film is coated in a layer of sentimentality that, certainly by the third act, becomes almost sugary.\nThat being said, however, I loved the warmer and lighter points of the film as much as I loved the more dramatic. Though helped certainly by the brilliant performances, Green Book's sentimentality doesn't stop it from being voraciously watchable. The final act drags, suitably like a car with a flat tyre, but otherwise the film is infectiously entertaining, bringing across its narrative in the most accessible way. In the end, perhaps Green Book isn't intended to be a gritty account on race relations; though there is more opportunity for nuanced drama, it feels far more like a feel-good crowd-pleaser.\nIn the end, Green Book may be a little simplistic in approach for more cultivated audiences, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining romp, made successful by two standout performances.",

It's a movie that manages to be entertaining and memorable while shining a light on the evils of ignorance and bigotry that sadly are celebrated so many years later by those who celebrate evil by raising the confederate and nazi flags. Thank you for making this movie, learning about the need for Greenbooks has renewed my commitment to eradicate injustice in whatever ways I can.",

Vallelonga and African-American pianist virtuoso Dr. Don Shirley became friends during a 1960\u0393\u0386(TM)s concert tour of the Deep South. The plot may be relatively simple but the road trip these two embarked on couldn\u0393\u0386(TM)t have been more difficult. A turbulent time for African-Americans (when isn\u0393\u0386(TM)t it?) \u0393\u0386\" particularly down south \u0393\u0386\" Dr. Shirley faced constant racism in his pursuit to spread the splendour of his music. Written by a trio including Nick Vallelonga, the screenplay has some issues. Operating in the well-worn \u0393\u0386~odd-couple\u0393\u0386(TM) subgenre (it\u0393\u0386(TM)s essentially a flipped Driving Miss Daisy), it relies heavily on clich\u0393\u0192 (C) to progress their relationship along. Dr. Shirley is the hard-nosed, cultured artist who at first is dismayed by Tony\u0393\u0386(TM)s uncouth behaviour, however, after bonding over racist cops, pub beat-downs and eating fried chicken (that Tony introduces to Dr. Shirley), their vast differences become the glue to their friendship. Yet the familiarity of the plot beats and character developments is largely surpassed by two powerhouse performances that elevate proceedings beyond the midday-movie script. Mahershala Ali imbues Dr. Shirley with layers of hidden guilt and regret, not least over his ostensible distance from the black community, whilst his stiff upper lip veneer subtly wavers through a plethora of emotional tribulations. As the other half of the duo, Viggo Mortensen\u0393\u0386(TM)s no-frills wiseass is also a complicated beast; his desire to do the right thing and be a more well-rounded person constantly battles with his overt masculinity and lack of formal education. Showered with awards nominations and wins already, Green Book overcomes its narrative shortfalls through commanding, complex portrayals by Ali and Mortensen.",

Director Peter Farrelly is mostly known for some of the funniest comedies I'd ever seen growing up which includes: Dumb and Dumber (1994), There's Something About Mary (1998) & Me Myself & Irene (2000). Unfortunately, his last few films have been some absolute disasters such as The Three Stooges (2012) & Dumb & Dumber To (2014), so to see how well he did with Green Book is really something. Based on some true events Green Book follows a bouncer named Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) in the 1960's. Tony is married and has two kids, but is struggling to provide for his family. He get's a call one day to interview for a drivers position to a doctor, so he agrees. Little does he know he shows up and meets Dr. Don Shirley a black musician that needs a driver to make sure he can get to his concerts in the deep south. Eventually Tony agrees and begins to take Don on the long road trip to the south. During this trip Don and Tony begin a friendship that also experiences the racial injustices of the south during the 1960's as well as learn a bit more about themselves in the process. Is the movie predictable? Yes, but man it has a lot of heart. It's a great story about a friendship from the most unlikely of two people that are completely different from each other. Tony is a very rough and rowdy type, while Don is a very well educated and well mannered person that teaches Tony how to be a better person. The movie is heavy handed in the aspect of talking about race and how things were, but it works. I enjoyed this one a lot and I was very surprised at first to see how funny it was, but when you realize on of the Farrelly brothers directed this it makes sense. The movie has some very good pacing and although it does have a bit of a \"Hollywood\" ending to it all I really liked this one. It has some great performances from the two leads and it's a overall great story. I would highly recommend checking this one out!",

The Green Book was a publication for black people to help them on their travels in the USA, particularly in the deep south. Hotels and restaurants that welcomed 'coloured' people. But the film really only touches on the book lightly. It is more concerned about the relationship between Don Shirley, a world class pianist and Tony Lip, a white man employed to drive him to the South on a concert tour. Lip is an Italian-American of limited education who is blatantly racist whilst Shirley is extremely intelligent and refined. The centre of the film is their clash of cultures so to speak. Lip sees first hand the racism and bigotry Shirley has to encounter. The problem with the film, which many critics have raised, is it all seen through the eyes of the white man. How he deals with his racism and also others. Which is not surprising as the film was co written by Lip's son. I feel it would have been a much deeper film to centre on Dr Shirley's experiences. The film also tends to paint with brush strokes to appeal to a larger audience. This might make it more easily digestible but tends to diminish its potential power. Mahershala Ali is superb as the dignified Don Shirley, but I found Mortensen's performance to be rather contrived and over the top. Green Book is a worthy film, shining a light on a period of history that still resonates today. I just wish it was handled by more expert film makers.",

I have been in cars where I would throw some trash out the window and would be made to pick it up out of respect for my driver (and the environment) and I have also been outcasted due to prejudgents and have found more comfort in a bottle than a group of people, more times than I would like to recount.\nAnd the Green Book was a great plot device, self explanatory as a hotel guide, since the basis of the film is being on tour but still... \nNow being that I do plan on traveling through the South on route 66 sometime this year, this film does raise some alertness for me and I believe others who have seen the film from not wanting to provide the South any tourism out of fear of pigmentist prejudice but the tour in general showcased in the film was a moment in time used to conquer that prejudice, so in terms of travel, it would not hurt to use the bravery exemplified in the film to continue to gain new experiences out of my comfort zone just like purchasing two tickets to Green Book was a left turn in light of my usual movie viewing that I am glad that I made.",

            "content": "It is possible to analyze \"Green Book\" from some points of view. It's a film about racism. But it's also a road movie that talks about an unimaginable friendship. It is also a film that shakes the prejudice of deep America, especially the South of the United States. It is still a film about a character who is not in any environment because he is in the rare position of the privileged black and feels a deep loneliness for it. None of this is original. None of this is something that other movies have not talked about in movie history. But how delightful, bothersome and interesting is to follow the journey of pianist Don Shirley (a brilliant Mahershala Ali) and his driver and captain Tony Vallelonga (equally wonderful).\n\nParticularly, \"Green Book\" has more interesting in two of the points above. The first is such an improbable relationship between Tony, this brassy, simple-minded Italian who sees the world so bluntly and directly, separating people into tribes with their own ingrained and unmixed customs, and Shirley, a black man of erudite education, who lives as an isolated king at the top of Carnegie Hall. And it's amazing that even in such ignorance he made Shirley see how far he was from himself.\n\nThe story of Peter Farrelly's film is real. In fact in the 1960s, Shirley was a very popular pianist who decided to tour the most racist chants in America. Your objective is touching people's hearts.\n\nBut how difficult it is to break historic and archaic barriers. Shirley has to go through some ridiculous situations. At night, he is a brilliant pianist applauded by all white and wealthy audiences. But during the day it's just another black man who can not eat at the same restaurant in his audience or use the same bathroom.\n\nAs much as the film does not portray the hell it was to be a black man in that region, and its name comes from a survival guide there, it's still cruel, almost disgusting to anyone who sees everything that Shirley has to go through to keep the idea of your tour alive. It is important, however, as the character himself states, \"maintain dignity\". Only by dignity is overcome the rabid prejudice.\n\nBut \"Green Book\" is not only about the pure denunciation of racism in a region of America. It is in the hassle and distance that Shirley himself feels among his peers that the film exposes his signs of greatness. It is by showing that he is not black enough to be among his own, neither white nor man enough to occupy other groups, that \"Green Book\" exposes the terrible loneliness of a man who finds himself in the middle of the path of a triangle over which he does not have the skills, or the supposed qualities, necessary to occupy no vertex.\n\nIn a fragmented society that needs labels Shirley is never to be found. It connects to nothing and feels isolated in all environments. His most faithful companion is a carafe of expensive alcohol, which keeps him away from everyone and plunged even more into solitude.\n\nWho are your peers? It is not whites who hate him when he is off the stage and deny him the right to experience a suit in a shop. It is not the black people, with whom he does not connect precisely because he does not share the same rich but different culture from his classical piano education, and by wearing expensive, well-cut suits.\n\nFor him, approaching both sides requires an instrument of conciliation for music. Hence his tour trying to repeat something similar that Nat King Cole tried a decade earlier. Its purpose is to touch the hearts of the people and to approach the vertices so far apart appealing to the sense of humanity. To perhaps feel less alone. But also help change the society.\n\nThe work, however, is slow and gradual. And in the great friendship that Shirley builds with Tony, a man who shows himself to be racist at the beginning of the film, but whose friendship and partnership with Shirley grows throughout the tour, is that his success can make itself present.\n\n\"Green Book\" relies heavily on the excellent work of Ali and Mortensen. It's not by chance that both have received well-deserved Oscar nominations. The first one proves the excellent moment that is living two years after receiving the supporting statuette for \"Moonlight\" (2016). His work on the third season of \"True Detective\" also deserves praise. The second is an actor who is in his third Oscar nomination and almost always does good work.\n\nBut beyond that, it is a great story and so necessary to be told in times when racism and prejudice in general against various kinds of peoples, ethnicities, sexual orientations and religions are unfortunately so vivid. They are wounds that still bleed too much when one should work to build a more just and balanced society for all. If each sought to create bridges such as those that united Shirley and Tony, it might be a less lonely, richer and more interesting planet to live for all.",

One of the best comedy-dramas I've seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. Peter Farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. Still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A+, but guess what...\"",

Green Book is essentially a 2-man show, but Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali turn in great performances as the reluctant odd couple. I've always believed that Mortensen is criminally underrated as an actor, and a film like this utilises his greatest talents, especially his mastery of accents. Ali, an Oscar-winner for Moonlight, is just as impressive as a highly-strung artist who needs some help connecting to those below him. It's basically a road trip movie, but it doesn't have the draggy middle section endemic to such films. Our heroes travel the Deep South, fighting off racists at every turn, and slowly begin to learn things about not just each other, but themselves. It's a film that rests largely on the chemistry between the leads, and both play off each other brilliantly. What I perhaps loved most about the film is its complete reluctance to sentimentalise. There's no sudden moment where both men are transformed, there's no giant dramatic scene where they lay everything bare and embrace in tears, there's simply a series of events where they learn that their behaviour and preconceived notions are flawed or just inaccurate, and they both become better people for it. It's a welcome chance to see comedy director Peter Farrelly taking a swing at dramatic work, and with Green Book he pulls it off beautifully.",

After all, this is the same guy that co-directed Dumb and Dumber and There\u00e2(TM)s Something About Mary. So, to think he could tackle a touchy subject such as this left me with some reservations at first.\n\nThose reservations were quickly erased once the chemistry between Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) and Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) graced the screen. The subject at hand was handled with the delicate care that it needs, but also had plenty of humor to keep the audience laughing and smiling.\n\nSome have said that this story wasn\u00e2(TM)t exactly an accurate portrayal of the relationship between Tony and Don. Well that may be true, it doesn\u00e2(TM)t take away how well done the movie was. Plenty of films over embellish or flat out lie about real events. I\u00e2(TM)m never one to judge a movie based on how accurate it was to the real story. I want a good movie that makes me think long after I\u00e2(TM)ve left the theater.\n\nGreen Book will leave you with multiple different emotions. At times, you\u00e2(TM)ll be angry and frustrated at how race relations in the deep south were in the 1960s and well before. Other times, you\u00e2(TM)ll find yourself laughing right along with Tony and Don as they encounter another predicament on the road.\n\nI know it\u00e2(TM)s early into 2019, but I have a feeling that this will be one of my favorite movies that I\u00e2(TM)ll see this year. I was focused and intrigued for every minute at not only the personal relationship on screen but the public relationship with minorities at the time. The film has already won several awards including Best Film in the comedy/musical category at this year\u00e2(TM)s Golden Globes.\n\nDo yourself a favor and see this movie while you still can in theaters. Any movie where that can leave you smiling and thinking afterwards is well worth the money.",

            "content": "Sometimes being alone means not being accepted. A fact that some have attempted to convey in the art of cinema, but only a few reach the precision and emotional strength of Green Book which shows not only the complex and dark social issues of the 1960s but also demonstrates the power and emotion of feeling truly alone.\nThis movie contains a massively wide range of emotions. At times, the story is driven by love, romance and family. At other times, the characters live in racism, homophobia and segregation as it directly addresses and shows the darkness of the 60s in the United States. Yet still, the viewer will be surprised by the amount of humor and wonderfully vibrant moments that are portrayed. They will make you laugh in all the right places, without interrupting truly emotional moments.\nGreen Book follows the highly famous and incredibly successful pianist, Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), who takes great risks as an African American man touring through the highly racial deep south. Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) accompanies Shirley going from his driver to savior to eventually, his close friend. As the tour progresses, the audience goes through many parts of the south where not only racism was prevalent against African Americans and Italians, but also acknowledge the severe homophobia that existed so terribly in the 1960s.\nPerhaps one of the most lovable aspects of this movie can be attributed to the story itself. Every person in the film has a major character arc in which they become completely reshaped and remolded by the end. The entire cast performs with Oscar-worthy emotional portrayals of their characters. Mahershala once again delivers absolutely heart-wrenching scenes as the audience becomes acquainted with the lonesome and depressed life Don Shirley lives in, despite being unarguably talented and highly intelligent. The complexities in the set design, costume design, and overall tone of the entire world never run out of depth as the entire film feels as if it truly belongs in the 1960s, despite being shot nearly half a century later. Director Peter Farrelly may be seasoned in humoristic comedies, but makes sure his background stays separate for this film.  With his lead, the audience experiences bitter reality and, with the help of cinematographer Sean Porter, view a vivid and colorful picture of United States in the 1960s, from up north in New York all the way to down south in Alabama. \nCinema about musicians would be blasphemy without an impressive soundtrack to follow suit. From music considered modern and pop for that era, to classical pieces hundreds of years old, Green Book promises a highly wide and diverse soundtrack that highlights itself as one of the greatest this year. Furthermore, the music tells the story as it begins with 1960s music, but slowly goes more and more towards classical and orchestral as the story unfolds and the viewer learns more about the conflicts of pianist Don Shirley. Furthermore, despite being over two hours long, the film keeps you captivated for the entire runtime and leaves you satisfied with a natural and beautiful ending.\nInstead of a favorite scene, I would like to talk about several sequences present in the film. Since they\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)re on tour, of course, Shirley and his fellow musicians in his trio are shown playing music. Yet, this varies in emotion, strength and passion as real-life events impact Don Shirley's craft just as the events impact his actual character. The power of his work never dwindles and always leaves you in awe. During the performance scenes, every aspect of the film shines with absolutely masterful cinematographic compositions that seem to isolate the musicians and truly captures the raw emotions such powerful music creates.\nDespite the beauty and power that hold true throughout this film, it does have things to concern parents. As previously stated, the film embraces the bitter and blunt reality of the 1960s, from homophobia to racism. This makes it most appropriate for ages 14 to 18, as well as adults. I absolutely give the film 5 out of 5 stars for its powerful portrayal of an inspirational journey that promotes courage, activism and always doing what\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s right in the world.",

And a reminder that Viggo Mortensen has never won an Oscar.\nI mean... how on earth you people say that Green Book is a feel-good movie?! This is so dark and infuriating!\n\nSeriously though, despite its heavy themes, this movie is, surprisingly, supremely delightful to watch. Partly, thanks to the electrifying chemistry between Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, whose equally phenomenal performances prove that they are two of the most talented actors working today. But largely, thanks to Peter Farrelly's nifty direction. Not only has he shown maturity as a director, but Farrelly also completely understood how to blend his sense of humour with a dramatic movie, and hence more earnest tone and more serious subject matter, way more serious! If he sticks with this refreshing style of filmmaking, and collaborate with excellent screenwriters, such as the writers of the screenplay of this movie, I bet that he will be one of the most popular directors in the coming years. The way he handles his performers, or shots a comedic scene here were really out of the ordinary.\n\nThe relatively deliberate pace couldn't have been more challenging for Peter Farrelly to stick with a particular tone, and find balance for this movie, but besides his palpable capability of doing so, the script, which he also co-wrote, offered sincere and genuine smart dialogues, and extremely likable reasonably fleshed-out characters, made this task way much more easier. Let alone the astonishing performances from the entire cast.\n\nThe screenplay is what to blame, however, for these two points I took away from my rating for this movie.\n\nFirst, there is an action Mortensen's character, Tony Lip, take at the beginning of the movie that didn't add anything to the movie. This action also had some consequences that took some time. Adding insult to injury, this action, along with its consequences, was nothing but a cheap trick to make the viewers make a wrong judgment about the character.\n\nSecondly, there was an abrupt change of mind made by the same character that, however understandable it might be, I still found it hard to swallow.\n\nThirdly, and most importantly, the illogically symmetric pattern of the storytelling; the plot keeps moving forward in a very unrealistic by making every phase in the movie seemingly predictable. It's safe to say that a movie with a fairly familiar themes like this one can easily suffer from such problem.\n\nThat said, Green Book is undoubtedly one of the most 2018 movies that I've enjoyed watching. Peter Farrelly miraculously managed to make a movie that tackles such sore themes, a breezy crowd-pleaser. \"That's how to break a peak\", Peter!\n\n(8/10)",

And beneath the surface of all that humor, lies a deeper message that deep and meaningful friendships that transcend race, social status and other man-made concepts can be formed.\n\nThere is however, some valid criticism on this film. Despite being the title of the film, the Green Book itself is hardly ever brought up, and apparently the portrayal of the characters was completely untrue to the originals (like the Social Network level untrue).",

            "content": "Oscar season is now in full swing, so all the character-driven dramas with serious subject matter are coming out in droves. Hence, I give you \"Green Book\", a perfect example of this type of Oscar fodder. That's not to say it isn't good - it is. It's just nothing we haven't seen before... many, many times. This movie is a historical drama about racism in the '60s, and you will recognize its familiar trappings (it's this year's equivalent of 2017's \"Hidden Figures\"). For those of you (like me) who don't get the title, the Green Book was the guide that black people travelling in the south in the 60s had to use to find hotels/restaurants willing to serve them. The story is about a black musician (Mahershala Ali) who embarks on a tour of performances in the south, and the white, very New York Italian man (a nearly unrecognizable Viggo Mortensen) who he hires as his driver/bodyguard for the trip. If nothing else, this film is an opportunity for both actors to flex their acting muscles, and flex them they do - I'll be surprised if they don't both get Oscar nominations for their trouble. The story is basically \"The Odd Couple Goes on the Road\": one is a fussy, dandy-type, the other is an uncultured but well-meaning brute. But surprise! They both learn from each other and become friends in the end! It's all very sweet and the actors really make you believe it, but c'mon, this story is about as predictable as it gets, and it all feels a little too pat in the end. The movie is more about the relationship between the two men than it is about racism, but as I'm sure you'll guess, the further south they go, the more racisty things get for them. I have to say it, I'm getting sick of movies about how racist the south is (or was). I know the 60s were peak-racism times, but the southerners in this film are such an over-the-top racist hilljack stereotypes, it's too much. Thankfully, the film does not absolve the northerners - they are racists too, just in a more subtle way. I would be remiss not to mention that this film was directed by Peter Farrelly, who you will know from such poignant and delicate dramas as \"There's Something About Mary\" and \"Dumb and Dumber\". I know! A soft touch is not something I would ever have expected from him, but he really delivers it with this film, handling both the funny and emotionally-charged moments with equal deftness. Though the movie feels genuinely heartfelt and is technically very well-done - the writing, directing, acting, and pacing are all excellent - it falls shy of being remarkable. But it still delivers exactly what it promises: a feel-good, character-driven, period piece.",

            "content": "\"Green Book\" derives its name from \"The Negro Motorist Green Book,\" an annual publication from 1936-1966 designed to help people traveling while black to find friendly lodging, restaurants and gas stations and to keep from running afoul of a variety of arcane local laws (if you're interested, learn about \"sunset towns\").\n\nIn 1962, Dr. Don Shirley, a classically trained pianist, left his opulent apartment above Carnegie Hall in NYC to tour the Midwest and Deep South.  The record company sponsoring his tour had the good sense to hire a driver/bodyguard/valet to help him navigate the perils of the South in the period just before the Civil Rights Act.  Tony (Lip) Vallelonga was hired for those roles and worked with Shirley during his two-month tour.  The challenges faced and overcome by Shirley are entirely predictable - overt racism, harassing cops, etc.  But \"Green Book\" is not intended to be a history lesson.  It's a story about enduring friendship.\n\nAs the two lead characters, Mahershala Ali (\"House of Cards,\" Oscar for \"Moonlight\" in 2016, a can't-wait upcoming role in \"True Detective,\" Season 3) and Viggo Mortensen (\"Lord of the Rings\" series, \"A History of Violence,\" \"Eastern Promises\") perform a series of memorable duets.  Unable to rely on his Danish-American heritage for this role, Mortensen (Tony) adopts a Bronx accent that would fit right in on \"The Sopranos.\"  This makes perfect sense, given that the real Tony Lip had a recurring role in the series.  (Regrettably, for all his talking, our Tony never lets loose with \"Ba-Da-Boom, Ba-Da-Bing.\")  His rough-and-tumble, street-smart approach to the world stands in stark contrast to the well-educated Dr. Shirley (Ali), who struggles mightily because he is neither black enough not white enough to fit in anywhere.  Dr. Shirley's struggles to teach Tony diction, manners and Oxford English (Oxford, England, not Oxford, Mississippi) are highlights of the film.\n\nWhat drives the narrative, though, is the bond built between the two men.  Tony is in awe of Dr. Shirley's regal bearing and erudition (Shirley earned a doctorate in Music, Psychology and Liturgical Arts).  Shirley, in turn, sees Tony's good heart and envies the passion and wonder through which he views the world.  Spying a road sign announcing a KFC up the road, Tony enthuses, \"Kentucky Fried Chicken in Kentucky... When's that gunna happen?  The chemistry between the two is funny, touching and the glue that holds this film together.\n\nDirector Peter Farrelly (\"There's Something about Mary,\" \"Dumb and Dumber,\" \"Stuck on You\") has reined in his slapstick impulses and over-reliance on visual humor.  The result is thoughtful, honest and memorable.\n\n\"Green Book\" does not offer its audience profound insights into the human condition.  But it does suggest, as Shirley's character discovers, that occasional human interaction, in small controlled doses, might actually be worthwhile.",

They certainly are the engine that drives this film as I feel this is really the only strength it has.  The story itself is fine, perfectly serviceable but it is hardly a concept that has any originality.  Driving Miss Daisy with the races reversed.  Two men from different cultures and social positions learning and growing from traveling with each other.  Don't get along at first but then grow to be friends.  They meet racism along the way and giving those racists some comeuppance as well.  Film takes a few side streets here and there but the main road is stuck to for the most part.  The acting sells it really well can't argue with that though.  Plus if the story is told well enough then even if Green Book hits familiar beats it can be a good watch even so.  Which I think it was I simply can not call it one of the best films of the year, Oscar bait is what it is.  I'm sure thee will be a Best Picture nom, probably Director as well and not just one for acting.  \n\nThis kind of movie is popular lately though especially with the current political and social climate but for me I would warn moviegoers not to expect anything groundbreaking with Green Book, movie will check off the required plotpoints of this genre but will be elevated by the actors involved.  Recommended with lowering expectations a tad.",

This already overridden concept on film-making, narrows down the finite possibilities of the makers where they are cornered in the familiarity, and Farrelly's heartwarming answer to these accusations is simplicity. Carrying out the usual theme with a typical textbook structure, there is an ease, almost impenetrable by any of the weakness, that helps bubble up the best possible outcome from this journey. In fairness, Farrelly is not challenging himself. He is playing way too safe, convincing but never a stranger.\n\nHis fear over going an avant-garde vocab wrong is won over by his brilliant execution. His world, no matter how unfair, is perfectly balanced. Raising questions and clearing doubts, the trajectory of all the sub plots is predictable and yet entertaining. These old methods of intertwining two opposite personas in a room and working its way up to an imperishable friendship by accepting the difference of opinion, just works, it flows.\n\nAnd we may have already encounter the usual, narrow minded and open minded, coy and bold, rich and poor debate over the years in cinema but with a performance as such from the cast, you cannot stop yourself for being giddy up for more. Mortensen as a free spirited Italian-American living at the brisk of his life is the teddy bear of the film. His adorable feature may as well be funny, but a world so tiny and shiny with his eyes is something the viewers connect with instantly.\n\nAnd balancing the other side of the coin, Ali as a poised artist that quotes \"dignity\", is the huskier bit of the film. Portraying an infamous persona as such, Ali's performance is a testimony to his marvelous career, from performing an act on stage through resisting the urge to be parental with Mortensen, his performance craves your attention. But nevertheless, Mortenson's buoyant expressive nature is much more three dimensional and cinematic to share the applause, from his body language to his sense of humor, he slaps other artists on screen with an unflinching portrayal. Your usual montage sequences like helping each other with something they are natural with, this half and half team makes a complete ten on screen.\n\nMortensen preaching on the practicality and ruggedness of the street is hysterical whilst Ali's genuinely moving descriptions over the letters, humbles your opinion as it ages on screen. Clocking at more than two hours, narration flows like a smooth vivid fluid that keeps encouraging you for more of these stops. Has Farrelly managed to make his best film till date? Definitely, but what surprises you, is that it is his funniest too. He is just natural in his comic tone. And the dramatic part is relied upon the performance which never disappoints. The toe-tugging conversations in a car cruising over the locations is the ultimate peak of the film that is delivered at multiple orderly stages. Green Book is an already-read open book, but it never hurts to revisit those pages, the perspective has evolved.",

Confronted with racism, danger-as well as unexpected humanity and humor-they are forced to set aside differences to survive and thrive on the journey of a lifetime.\n\nWhen I first saw the trailers for \"Green Book\", I though it looked interesting but honestly, I wasn't too sure about how it turned out. On a lovely winter evening, my girlfriend and I decided to go see the film. What turned from a trip to the theaters ended up being one of my favorite films of the entire year. \n\nOne thing that was amazing was the acting. Yes, Viggo Mortensen was amazing in so many ways but damn, Mahershala Ali really stood out in this film. Look, I personally hate the Oscar's and I think they really don't serve much purpose but if anyone is going to be in contention for one, I think Ali fits the bill. These two had wonderful chemistry that really brought out so much in this film. We got to see their characters grow and develop in an ingenious way of story-telling. They're both flawed but both develop well together, ultimately leading us to this wonderful story. \n\nFrom a screenwriter's perspective, this film had a top-notch screenplay. It was so well written and crafted, that I honestly think it was near flawless. The way it was structured, its pacing, everything was great. The overall theme in the film really shed more light on a perspective that film has granted me throughout the years. It's filled with amazing big moments, but also a lot of tender, sweet moments that make this film so memorable. It's an amazing screenplay brought to the big screen. \n\nThis is set back in a difficult time. The time period served a purpose and it was well established. It was used to propel our characters and push them forward, while giving us some much needed perspective. It allows its audiences to learn so much more by placing us in a situation and because of how it was executed, I felt like I was there the whole time.\n\nIn the end, \"Green Book\" was an amazing film. I came out of it astonished and amazed at what I saw. I highly recommend it and it was one of my favorites of the year.",

            "content": "While Green Book may appear to be simple Oscar bait aimed at older demographics, I can assure you that this is not the case.  The plot gets started when an Italian Mob-adjacent, low-level bouncer finds himself out of work when the Copacabana club he works at closes down for a couple of months.  (Yes, the same Copacabana from that famous tracking shot in Goodfellas.)  Not wanting to become a mob soldier, he takes a job for distinguished African-American concert pianist, Don Shirley.  He is to drive Shirley across the Deep South in a Cadillac DeVille, make sure that he stays in \"Colored\" friendly establishments, and to act as his bodyguard.  This road trip goes about as well as you'd expect.  Tony's coarse and boorish demeanor irritate Shirley, and Tony asserts that Shirley is detached from his \"own people.\"  Over time, Don's erudite language and writing acumen rubs off on his driver, while Tony get his employer to lighten up and stand up for himself.  \n\nGreen Book could be described as Driving Miss Daisy for Men, but it's a bit more than that, with a fair amount of punch and tense moments.  It's also pretty fuckin funny.  Yeah, no shit I was laughing my ass off the entire time, as was the rest of the audience.  Most of which comes from the ridiculous conversations between our low-level mobster and his sophisticated, but out of place companion, while trying not to get murdered in Hickville.  And this comes down to performances.  Mahershala Ali is on fire these days, and his work here is no exception.  While it would seem that he is relegated to the \"straight man\" of the story, it's more that he's the anchor that holds it together.  He has plenty of moments of levity and it was interesting to watch his emotional progress through the film.  Viggo Mortensen is a riot and while his character does border on tri-state area Italian stereotypes, it works.  Mortensen has amazing comedic timing and I enjoyed every minute of it.  Peter Farrelly does a competent job telling this story, which is surprising as he mostly did low brow comedies before this.  As for the controversy surrounding Green Book, no I don't feel that this classifies as a \"white savior\" film.  They save each other, as saccharine as that sounds.  It's more of an arthouse road trip picture than anything else.  I don't know if it handles race in the best manner, but it doesn't make too many missteps.  One scene did annoy me, in which both characters are screaming at each other in the rain.  (It's almost a parody of Oscar clip nonsense.)  Both main characters are based on real people, as Tony Lip would later have small roles in The Godfather, Goodfellas, and The Sopranos.  Don Shirley really was a world renowned classical and jazz pianist, though it has been disputed how close these two really were.  In either case Green Book is an enjoyable watch for just about anybody, and while it's not perfect, it's pretty damn good.",

Mortenson is terrific in the role of a clumsy yet caring driver, while Ali brings nuance and depth to the role of the African-American pianist. Both these actors deliver performances that will surely not be forgotten come awards season. Although it suffers slightly from a lengthy running time, \"Green Book\" is a must-see this holiday season.

I think that the director and producer did a great job at getting the message of racism in the 1960\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s across appropriately without having the audience become too overwhelmed with the mature topic/theme. I think that the conflict and topic of this movie is what makes it so interesting and intriguing. The director creatively showed us racism through Don Shirley being a black musician and not having the right to do things such as go to the restroom at one of his events. Another element of film is the unacceptability in the movie. The unexpected bond between Tony Lip and Don Shirley is what makes this movie so funny and entertaining. An example of this is when Don and Tony are driving and stop to get food, Tony ends up stealing a rock and Don makes him put it back. The argument that they had during this scene are very funny and interesting.  Although the movie was set in the 1960\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s the racism witness then is still prevalent today. I feel that this makes the movie relatable and extremely important for today's generation. The Green Book is a great movie that makes you think after watching it about many different issues in that time and also today. Overall I think it was a great film, the only downside for me of the movie was that I was waiting for something big and extreme to happen and I felt as though that didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t happen.

            "content": "On it's surface, Green Book seems to be a your typical 'after school special', early 60's racism was bad especially in the South, narrative.  With most critics focusing on how the racial issues are handled, and with others focused on winning the 'virtue signaling' championship (Richard Brody, et al). However, the more important theme to the story is isolation. Isolation stemming from the case that piano virtuoso, Don Shirley, is also gay.\n\nThis revelation comes to light when Don Shirley's driver, Tony Lip, finds Don being arrested at a YMCA shower sitting naked with a White man by his side.  Tony bribes the cops and points out the obvious life shaping fact to Don, that if this gets out, it could ruin his career.\n\nThis fact answers many questions. Like in one previous scene, Tony rescues Don getting beat up at a White bar.  Which, on it's face, seems like Don was maybe flouting convention and trying out a Rosa Parks moment. But, as Tony gets Don out of the jam, he asks why he came to that bar to drink when normally he drinks alone at his apartment.  The subsequent YMCA scene answers that.  He's attracted to White men and that's why he went to a White bar.  In contrast, this happens immediately after Don rejects an invitation to play backyard games with his Black neighbors at his hotel.\n\nIt becomes apparent that the discrimination Don Shirley receives from White society as a Black man is not as severe as the rejection and isolation he feels from the Black community as a Gay man. \n\nThis also answers what Shirley means when he says he has not been able to keep a relationship with his 'brother'.  A line that was a point of contention with Don Shirley's real family who said they were always close with Don. Not realizing the line was a euphemism for Don's ex-boyfriend or hypothetical boyfriend, juxtaposed with a conversation about Tony's relationship with his wife. \n\nThis gave Don something else he had in common with Tony.  They both had to be 'bullshit artists' even if for different reasons.\n\nThe isolation Shirley feels is also experienced at a milder level byTony.  Hired to be a driver for two months.  Cut off from his family and friends with a poor ability to communicate with his wife through letters.  And also isolated from conversation with Don on their long drives between gigs.\n\nThat isolation is broken down when Don begins to help Tony write those letters to his wife in a more poetic fashion.  Almost like Don was writing a letter to a hypothetical boyfriend he would never be able to realize.",

            "content": "Green Book plays like a twenty-first century rendition of Driving Miss Daisy, a well-meaning and relatively gentle movie about race relations where a prejudiced white person comes about thanks to their firsthand friendship with an African-American male. It's reportedly inspired by the true story of Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a nightclub bouncer, driving around a famed pianist, Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), as he performed throughout the South in 1962. The best part of the movie is the character interaction between this odd couple, and you'll get plenty of it too. The actors burrow into their very distinctly conflicting characters, so it's a natural pleasure to watch them eventually bond and learn from one another. This is the kind of racism that doesn't make people feel too uncomfortable, and you could say that about the film as a whole. It's a bit safe and has its intentions set on being a big, inclusive crowd-pleaser, and it plays like one. There are moments to make you laugh, moments to make you cheer, and moments to make you tear up. Morstensen and Ali are terrific together and find dignity and humanity in characters that could have easily become one-note stereotypes. The more we learn about Dr. Shirley the more interesting he becomes, a man used to feeling like an outsider no matter the company he keeps. Watching the two men grow and open up to one another can be heartwarming and deeply satisfying. Remarkably, the film is directed and co-written by one half of the Farrelly brothers, the pair responsible for ribald comedies like There's Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber. It's an easy movie to fall for, with its winning formula and enjoyable actors, but there's a little nagging concern I have that Green Book is too safe, too straight, and too pat in its life lessons. Despite its Best Picture win, it's not like Driving Miss Daisy has any lasting cultural impression, and I wonder if maybe Green Book is destined for the same. Still, the acting and writing is enough to bring a smile to your face and remind one's self about the power of kindness.\n\nNate's Grade: B",

            "content": "There isn't a person you wouldn't love if you could read their story. I tend to try and not speak in absolutes and there may or may not be some exceptions to this rule, but the point is an obvious one: all the races and people with different sexual orientations or different religious beliefs can get along once we really get to know one another; that we're not really all that different after all. That's all well and good, but it's also a tried and true formula that at least one Hollywood production trots out every awards season to try and make us all feel better about ourselves. One might think, given the current cultural climate, that any movie attempting to bring people together might immediately be dismissed as one party's agenda to corrupt another into actually having a conversation with a person of opposing views, but maybe that's ultimately why Green Book feels so good right now and ironically, so needed. There isn't a damn thing here you haven't heard or seen before and director Peter Farrelly (one half of the brother directing duo who brought us comedy classics like Dumb & Dumber and There's Something About Mary, but also brought us Dumb & Dumber To and The Heartbreak Kid) directs with the eye of about as mainstream a filmmaker as it gets meaning there is nothing glaringly unique or interesting about the way in which he captures these events, but this does mean it will undoubtedly speak to a very large audience. There was some slight hope that Farrelly might utilize his experience in his years of making broad studio comedies to infuse the many predictable formulas this movie utilizes with a more striking tone or presence, but while taking on a project like this might have been a bold thing for the filmmaker to do given his past credits he alas decides to do nothing bold in the execution of this change in pace, but instead plays it right down the middle. Fortunately for Farrelly, the story has such a great inherent hook and given he's hired two more than capable talents to lead his film it hardly matters how he's saying what he wants to say as long as it's competent enough to capture how Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are saying what they want to say. It's largely through these two performers that Green Book transcends the calculations of a movie such as itself, eclipsing every predictable note it plays that could have so easily rung false to become something genuinely endearing; a true crowd-pleaser in the least cynical and most delightful of ways.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

It wrecks the labels and stereotypes they rely on to define people, motives, our past, and our current political climate. This film takes class, race, educated, and non educated, and flips them upside down from the traditional sense, then smashes them together. What emerges, even as 1960s society tries to box the characters in, is a poignant realization of the futility in identifying people as a group. That we are all individuals first. Flawed, misconstrued, confused, imperfect, yet also caring, compassionate, talented, and well meaning. Mortensen and Ali are both excellent and deliver outstanding performances as two men from different sides of the tracks who, according to 60ssociety, should never get along or form a bond. But they dont get sucked into that divisive abyss and instead judge each other through their own interactions. This film has humor, drama, and a nice blend of non preachy realism that makes you empathize and identify with the characters without feeling like you're being lectured to. Highly recommended, for sure.",

            "content": " Update: I like it but something is off. New Grade: A- Green Book Review: Green Book is inspired by the true friendship of Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a working class Italian-American bouncer and Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an African-American pianist, as Tony Lip drives Dr. Shirley on his venue tour in the 1960s in the southern states. This is the movie, other than A Star is Born, that has been getting the biggest Oscar buzz this season. It seemed like an interesting plot and looked really good. I\u2019ve given out 4 A+ scores this year, one being for the miniseries Sharp Objects, and I\u2019m happy to say Green Book joins that group. I loved every minute of this movie! The story by Peter Farrelly was so good. Definitely will get a nomination for Best Original Screenplay, though I do think Roma will end up winning it. The dialogue worked. The pacing was good. There was just so much emotion put into this. As the tour gets deeper into the South, Dr. Shirley experiences more racism and you just had no words to describe all of the emotion and feelings put into those scenes. The performances by the two actors are the best of all year. Viggo Mortensen will win Best Actor. His portrayal of Tony Lip was amazing. His best performance yet. He was a lovable character. And it\u2019s a character that has flaws and it\u2019s acknowledged throughout and Viggo knew how to do that. Mahershala Ali will for sure win his second Oscar, first for playing Juan in Moonlight, playing Dr. Shirley. This is his best role to date. There were scenes that made me laugh and some bringing tears. This is a lock for Best Supporting Actor. I loved Linda Cardellini as Delores but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be recognized for her role. Peter Farrelly\u2019s direction was great. He has made some horrendous films in the past, one being Movie 43, but he did very well and could get a nomination for Best Director, probably won\u2019t win however. The score by Kris Bowers was very good. It was a mix of classical music that Dr. Shirley played and 60s jazz. I think he\u2019ll get a nomination for Best Original Score. Not too many scores have been released for upcoming films so it\u2019s hard to tell what he\u2019s up against though there are a few from earlier this year that could get nominated. The cinematography was good but not good enough for the nomination. In all honesty, so far this is the film that I think will win Best Picture at the Oscars 2019 (I will put my top 10 Best Picture Predictions below). It had so much to say and I think it\u2019s a film everyone should see. It\u2019s relevant and I will say my favorite Christmas movie to date. I was disappointed to see that it didn\u2019t make too much at the box office yet, only making 14.0 million and only #10 at the the top box office for its second week into its release. It was promoted at theaters but not many theaters got it. I had to go all the way to Appleton to see it and it was in a small theater that was packed. I was happy to see how many people went to see it. Overall you should see the movie when you get the chance. I don\u2019t think you could hate it. My Grade: A+ My Oscar 2019 Best Picture Predictions so far (they\u2019re pretty close to the Gold Derby Predictions): 1. Green Book 2. Roma 3. A Star is Born 4. If Beale Street Could Talk 5. The Favourite 6. Vice 7. BlacKkKlansman 8. First Man 9. Black Panther (it\u2019s really getting a lot of buzz) 10. Can You Ever Forgive Me? ",

He is back to take another grab at the statuette along with co-star Mahershala Ali. Anyone who knows me and this film will not  be surprised that I find this a perfect film. The story of a working class bouncer-type driving an erudite concert pianist around to performances in the American deep South in the early 1960s, seem increasingly Oscar-baity.  It is constructed and hits all the story telling rhythm notes one expects. Playing Tony Lip Vallenlogna, Mortensen makes me believe that he is s glutinous schlub. His corpulence is matched by a new level of slender on the part of  Ali. They are the new Odd Couple.  The organic quality of the growth of their mutual admiration and friendship is credible and engaging. For me the quality of this movie comes down to the fear in Dr. Don Shirley, the fear that Tony will leave him to face this situation alone. One can argue that this well-to-do well-educated black man oddly puts too much control in the hands of this white man, thereby undercutting a part of the message. If the message is friendship, then maybe letting go is the point. We find that Dr. Don Shirley's mission, his karma yoga, is to change hearts and mind in defying preconceived notions of the value of who or what he was, by being present.  The hearts he changes here are chiefly Tony's and his own. The performances are great. Linda Cardellini also turns in a strong performance as the wife of Tony Lip. The score is good. The cinematography is excellent.  The art direction is perfect. This movie is not a preachy baseball bat. Did I mention this is a story based on real people and a real relationship? This one is as good as a movie gets without bringing me to tears.",

            "content": "Usually, when a film is made and has very little depth in terms of storytelling, it would be forgotten about, but if you have a unique take on a specific story and the point of the movie is to keep it simple and explore only one facet of history. Personally, I prefer when stories are a little more fleshed out, but I also believe this simple story in Green Book is one of the best films of 2018. This is a movie that cares about its characters first and foremost and we don\u00e2(TM)t see many of those films hitting the big screen very often, so this was a pleasant surprise. Although there\u00e2(TM)s not much meat to the story (which may bore some viewers), I found Green Book to be a fantastic piece of filmmaking.\n\nFired from the downtown club and forced to take any job he can in order to support his family, Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) decides to take on the role of driving pianist Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) across the South, as he and his band perform for audiences. With the inclusion of the fact that Don is an African-American man in the 1960s and Tony being an Italian-American, many racial occurrences arise for these two. Being an unlikely pairing for that particular decade, these characters needed to be like-able and completely fleshed out in order for this film to work and those two aspects were absolutely astoundingly well-done in my opinion. This also stems from a particularly great turn by director Peter Farrelly.\n\nAlthough his earlier work on films like Dumb and Dumber and There\u00e2(TM)s Something About Mary are very commendable outings, his recent comedies haven\u00e2(TM)t exactly struck gold. Having his last few films being Dumb and Dumber To, Hall Pass, and The Heartbreak Kid, I was very worried about him taking on a more dramatic film. After watching this film, I felt ridiculous even thinking that, because not only has he shown maturity as a director this time around, but also completely understood how to blend his sense of humour with a more meaningful premise. If he sticks with this style of filmmaking, I can definitely see his name in the public eye more often in the coming years. The way he handles his performers here was truly something special.\n\nAs I said, it truly is the character arcs that carry this film and without amazing performances, this movie would\u00e2(TM)ve been forgotten. Mortensen and Ali both give their all in these roles and it shows. There wasn\u00e2(TM)t a single moment where I found myself scratching my head or not believing a decision they made or line of dialogue they spoke. In the vein of films like Driving Miss Daisy or even Before Sunrise, the conversations are the reason this film doesn\u00e2(TM)t feel slow. There\u00e2(TM)s hardly a single exciting scene and the movie clocks in at nearly 140 minutes. That\u00e2(TM)s when you know the dialogue has been written very well by the trio in Nick Vallelonga, Brian Hayes Currie, and Peter Farrelly.\n\nIn the end, I can\u00e2(TM)t see everyone loving this film, due to the slow pace it has, but it\u00e2(TM)s a breezy crowd-pleaser nonetheless. This movie has been generating major awards consideration and I think it deserves every bit of it and then some. I loved my experience watching this movie and I can\u00e2(TM)t wait to revisit it and take this journey with these characters again. Funny, sad, and heartwarming, Green Book easily earns the title of being one of the best feel-good movies in recent memory (at least to me). I loved this movie and I can\u00e2(TM)t recommend it enough.",

He is doing a concert tour of the Deep South and needs someone who can serve both as a driver and as protection.  Enter Tony \"Lip\" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen).  Now the buzz on this one has been pretty high, so I've been getting increasingly more and more excited for Green Book.  The trailers looked pretty damn good, and being that this headlines two acting heavyweights in Ali and Mortensen, I walked into this expecting one of the best movies of the 2018.  Well, I will go ahead and break the ice to let you know that I was not disappointed in the slightest by this.  Now what is easily the most surprising thing about this film is that it is directed by Peter Farrelly.  Yes, that is one half of the Farrelly brothers who are better known for There's Something About Mary, Dumb and Dumber and Shallow Hal.  Not that those movies don't have their audience, but to suddenly switch it up and helm an Oscar contender is the sort of drastic change that could give someone whiplash.  And yes, you better believe that this is going to at the very least get a ton of nominations this award season; I would be shocked if this got any less than four nominations from the Academy, and they would be completely well founded.  What you may not realize from watching previews is the extent of how funny this is.  It is an odd couple road trip movie when you break it down to basics, but what really makes this work as well as it does is the chemistry shared by Ali and Mortensen.  They are coming from polar opposites on the culture spectrum, and being that they are forced to spend so much time with one another, they have no choice but to meet each other in the middle.  Green Book works on a number of different levels, so of course you should go out of your way to see it.  It works as a biography, giving you insight into the lives of these gentlemen.  It works as a comedy, giving you a big belly laugh every ten minutes or so.  It works as a social commentary, as a period piece and even as a feel-good movie that will almost assuredly be the high point of your day.  I don't really have much to complain about, and if I did, it would be small nitpicks.  Go watch and support this movie.",

Spearhead all of that with some unsurprisingly magnificent performance work from both Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, and you've got yourself one of the better movies of the year.",

I noticed there was not a lot of attention put on the director, which if you look up who it is, you will be totally shocked! If this is how he can handle a drama, I think he has found a new path for the future. For the movie itself, I thought it was excellent. I've seen some reviews say if you are expecting something more along the lines of Driving Miss Daisy as opposed to Selma, you won't set yourself up for any disappointments. I guess that could be true on how to view this. Does it pay a lot of attention to what is going on in the country at this time? No. I don't think that should be strikes against the quality of this movie because it does not veer into those territories. It focuses more on the relationship of these two characters, their encounters and how they deal with them and each other. The two characters on their journey are the story and how they help each other evolve and broaden their own tolerances and understanding of the world (and each other). In the beginning, it starts out as a business relationship and as the friendship builds, you root for them to safely get out of circumstances and locations. The friendship peaks as they get to some of the most dangerous areas along the path. I think there is an increased tension that an audience member feels as you hope they can take care of each other and eventually make a safe return home. There is a surprising amount of humor that makes both characters all the more likeable. It is very much a fish out of water story on numerous levels ... the two characters who, at first, don't relate to each other but then take a journey together into an area that neither relates to. I think this movie will sneak in and out of theaters in a few weeks but just as nominations are announced (and it gets a few), it will be right about the time of the DVD/Blu-ray release. I think it will then get the attention it deserves.",

In the case of GREEN BOOK, a classically made, impeccably performed and written film, I wondered to myself, \"Should they?\".  Sometimes it's difficult to separate a film from the time in which it's been made, and for me, we have what amounts to a pleasant yet reductive film which my 1989 self would have enjoyed a whole lot more than I did in 2018.  In actuality, I found DRIVING MISS DAISY pretty insufferable even back then, so maybe I've always had a problem with racism filtered through a white perspective.\n\nGREEN BOOK, inspired by a true story, tells the tale of a vulgar Italian bouncer named Tony \"Lip\" Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) who, in 1962, gets hired by Dr. Don Shirley (Maershala Ali), an effete, accomplished pianist who lives above Carnegie Hall, to drive him around the country on a two month national tour, protecting him from the dangers of the racist South.  Their unlikely friendship informs this lightly comedic, heartwarming tale.  \n\nDirector Peter Farrelly (THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY), who co-wrote the script with Brian Hayes Currie and Tony's real life son Nick Vallelonga employs slick, classic filmmaking style where the images look pretty and the pace keeps the beautifully delineated script humming along for its entire run.  The jokes land, the character development feels refined and earned, the lump hits the throat in the third act just where intended, but the entire approach feels wrong.  \n\nIn a year in which the black experience has seen a creative renaissance with such films as BLACKKKLANSMAN, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, and IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK, to name a few, GREEN BOOK feels safe.  In the past, racism needed a white perspective with such films as IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, CRY FREEDOM, and MISSISSIPPI BURNING.  Through that lens, filmgoers could look at the issue as something in the past, allowing the sympathetic character to serve as their own window into this world.  Tony's wife Dolores (a terrific Linda Cardellini) fills that role in GREEN BOOK.  We can all say, \"That would have been me!\"  It offers the viewer a safety net in order to make the horrors of racism more palatable.  As someone who grew up in a fairly racist small town in Ohio, it was ugly and wrong and stupid.  It didn't feel better that there were nice people who meant well when the systemic problem overrode all of that.  I'll never forget the time one of my high school teachers stood up in front of the classroom and said she would never hire a black person for a job that a white person could do.  Everyone stayed silent, although I'm proud to say at a later time, I used her words against her.  The fact that she didn't lose her job proved that good intentions meant nothing in a society built on allowing such racism.  \n\nI'm not saying the story of GREEN BOOK shouldn't be told.  It truly means well.  Mortensen and Ali invest their characters with a tremendous amount of heart, both maintaining dramatic tension throughout.  A case can be made, however, that at its core, the film is a populist Christmas movie in which a tight Yule hug can save the world.  In 2018, at a time when the flames of racism have been fanned by a President keen on dividing a nation, GREEN BOOK would have benefited by telling its story entirely from Don Shirley's point of view.  Instead of what amounts to an unusual buddy movie, how about putting us in that back seat along with Shirley and digging into his inner life?  His exterior gets a lot of traction with his hand gestures, his beatific smile every time he finishes one of his glorious numbers, and his snobby leers at Tony's lack of culture and class.  Because we spend more time in Tony's shoes, we lose Don's key decision-making points.  Two examples would be when Tony has to come rescue Don from two perilous events.  Had we stuck with Shirley when he initiated these moments, we would have felt his fear, his naivet\u00e9, and his humiliation that much more.  \n\nI applaud the fact that this film shows a different type of black experience with the roles reversed from what we've grown accustomed to seeing.  It would have had so much more power, however, had it stayed strictly with Shirley and let us feel what it truly was like to sit in the backseat with a man-child at the wheel, with danger lurking around every corner, and with feelings of alienation within his own community.  Shirley's \"otherness\", which I won't spoil here, gets addressed and dismissed with a handful of lines.  I would have loved to have seen what a filmmaker like Dee Rees would have done with it, since MUDBOUND perfectly addressed both a white and black perspective so well.  The joy of Farrelly getting to make a film unlike anything he's done before and in a style he's clearly dreamed of attempting for so long gets overshadowed by the fact that GREEN BOOK, more than anything else, feels like a very nice, easily digestible missed opportunity.",

            "content": "Embarking on a journey through segregationist America at a time when overt racism and stereotypes were ruggedly sensitive, director Peter Farrelly skillfully circumvents the brute confrontation as it transports our attention deep down into a terrain of feel-good introspection. Based on real life, the film ventures largely to anticipate the expected\u2014 and the unexpected offshoot therein. Thanks to the remarkable Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, both in their A-games, who convincingly imparted a palpable juxtaposition of sharp contrasts. Tony Vallelonga (Mortensen), aka Tony Lip within his circle, is a semi-illiterate, garrulous, straight-talking, hard-hitting New York nightclub bouncer. For an Italian-American whose work ethics simply means doing his job up to the last jab, a one-hit punch to avert trouble seems like an easy routine. During his hiatus from the club, he was bound to find a job to make ends meet for his wife and kids in a tightly-knit working class Bronx neighborhood. Dr. Don Shirley (Ali), wealthily residing above the famous Carnegie Hall is a hands-down music virtuoso who could dexterously play out sentiments through his keyboards. A double doctorate in his expertise, he possesses an elegant demeanor, and the kind of finesse required of his reputation as a renowned musical genius. A New York native of Jamaican descent, Dr. Don occupies the upper strata of society, a rarity for such a colored man of his time. Nonetheless, listening to a long list of credits would convey a realization that giftedness much like skin tone is indeed inborn. Heeding the racial dangers that lie ahead as his trio heads toward the Deep South for a concert tour in 1962, Dr. Don calculatingly hires Tony to be his chauffeur (and eventual protector), as there\u2019s no other man who can truly deliver. After dispute and reluctance, Tony\u2014 whose previous motorist experience was limited to driving a garbage truck\u2014-accepts the package priced more than enough to change a man\u2019s heart. Traveling under one roof within each other\u2019s distance, Tony and Don\u2019s exchanges reveal a wide chasm deeply rooted on how things are or should be\u2014- depending on who\u2019s talking. The salient disparity between the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s minds or manners are mutually educative. As the trip digs southern on multi-state accommodations and appearances, so does the observance of racism dig deeper. Testing their resilience, events can turn differences into commonality, disagreements into friendship as both navigate the challenging Jim Crow era of the South. Mortensen, sporting a conspicuous beer belly from presumably gobbling up a truckload of pepperonis prior to portraying the part, delivered for the most laughs. His limited vocabulary automatically twitching his tongue to a crisp usage of \u201csh*t\u201d with gusto can certainly tickle you. Meanwhile, Ali\u2019s imposing screen presence is quite persuasive, his diction inductive. He casts a picture perfect of a black man whose success deserves respect, but not a guarantee to bend social rules. For all its classic one-liners neatly packed in a 130-minute jarring ride, the film demands your full attention. After all, the heart isn\u2019t black or white.",

This is an important film - based on a true story - about race and acceptance in the 1960s Southern United States. And talk about perfect chemistry! Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, always stunning, they've done it again in these roles. This is the type of harmony from two actors you don't see very often on-screen, and these two are such a treat in this film. Their character development throughout this journey, both of them, it's amazing to witness. The adversity they both face, the struggles with each other as well as with their own identities, down to the understandings they reach, really makes them stand out as performers.\n\nHonestly, I believe this film has to be a, if not THE frontrunner for best picture, with Mortensen and Ali definitely going head to head, seeing a lot of awards season love. Viggo Mortensen completely transformed in this role, absolutely left me speechless after the fact! And one of the film's final scenes, taking place in a jazz club, it is one of my favorites of the year - such an incredible, feel-good moment. I love this film and I cannot wait to see it again and again! It has shot straight up into my Top 5 of the year no doubt, and I truly hope you can get out and see it as well.

I don't think they could have casted a better group of actors to play in this movie  everyone in my opinion worked real hard to make this movie good. the relationship between  Dr. Don Shirley and Tony Lip had everything from laughs,drama and also sadness and pain. Back to the storyline while pretty simple it did indeed get very deep when it came to racism and all the evil it causes and  especially in the south where it did get alot worse but it also showed that in states up in the north while they might as not be as racist as those in the south they were still not totally willing to accept other races fully . Now usually the movies that I like(Marvel for example) never win any type of an award I think this could have a chance to win an oscar. This isn't going to be considered a block buster because it simply won't rake in hundreds of millions of dollars but its still a good movie and worth seeing.",

Although there were exaggerations in personality portrayal of both main characters as well as others, they were good for a laugh and emphasized, within the length of a movie, the transitions made in two months.\nWe both loved this movie!

The Pacing wasn't perfect but it never slowed down as you feel connected to the characters and the motives to get Mahershala Ali to all his concerts in the south. Honestly it's not as great as I intended from the trailers, however it didn't miss the mark at all and I absolutely had a blast with Green Book, and also props to Peter Farrelly who Directed and I believe Co-Wrote the film.

            "content": "The title of this movie comes from a road guide for Blacks to travel during the 1960s. And travel this movie does. Starring Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali, and directed by none other than Peter Farrelly, \"Green Book\" is a powerful tale about the lessons of manners, and it can effect people of different skin color. While the one of the film can be a little derailing in certain regards, and the movie does play more for fiction than history, the experience is still a good one. \"Green Book\" is a rather interesting and compelling look at how friendship and manners can come from the most unlikely of places.\n\nThe story is set in the year 1962, where Tony Lip (Mortensen) is a regular guy living in The Bronx. One day, Tony gets an offer that feels to crazy to pass up. Tony is given the opportunity to drive Dr. Don Shirley (Ali), a rather popular jazz pianist, on a tour in the deep south of the United States. Where racial tension is at its highest. Now, both Tony and Don must get along with each other, otherwise tensions will rise.\n\nWhat makes \"Green Book\" stand out is with the setting and its main leads.\n\nBoth Mortensen and Ali have perfect chemistry whenever they are together. Mortensen plays the tough guy from New York, who thinks a loud mouth will solve pretty much everything. Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, Ali plays a seemingly cool and quiet persona, who does have a way with words, in a more sophisticated mannerism. Whenever these two converse and clash with each other, it feels like the audience is truly invested in what is happening on screen, and what sort of outcome will be unveiled.\n\nIt also gives the viewer insight into how people are portraying themselves. And, it delves into how manners need to still be adressed.\n\nAs for the rest of the cast, while there isn't a lot of attention focused here, they still deliver a good job with what they are given.\n\nThe costumes look like something out of the 1960s, and they fit the characters well. In fact, the look of the film itself is quite amazing as it replicates the time period of the decade very well. Especially with the automobiles, which look incredible seeing them run after nearly half a decade on the road.\n\nThe pacing of this movie is just perfect. At a little over two hours, the film does take its time introducing the set up, but once it gets going, the audience will have an enjoyable time with these two characters.\n\nThe music is also keen on representing the style being played. Plus, with an orchestrated score by Kris Bowers, the movie does have a lively jazz feel its soundtrack.\n\nNow, onto the subject of the film's director: Peter Farrelly. Known for more over the top comedies with his brother, Bobby, and venturing into the more gross out style of humor, this is Peter's first foray into the world of drama. It's a neat little experiment, and Peter tries to blend both the comedy and the drama fine.\n\nThis, however, leads into the biggest issue with the film: the tone.\n\nJudging by the promotional material, one would assume that this would be a historical drama. In fact, there is more comedic moments than there are dramatic. If the film had kept a consistent tone, then the movie would have been perfect. Also, because of this, the does tend to stray away from fact, and relate more fiction than anything else.\n\n\"Green Book\" is just like the travel guide. It is an interesting experience, with a few bumps along the way. But by the end, the viewer will have a good time with themselves.",

It also sounded to me like a takeoff of \"Driving Miss Daisy\" only with a white driver and a black passenger which would probably be 'Hollywoodized\" and \"the Odd Couple\" thrown in as the arc of the movie and it is..\n\nI went only because I am a long time fan of Viggo Mortensen and was impressed with Mahershala Ali in \"Moonlight\". I expected to see a so-so film with good performances and we certainly saw the latter but it won me over showing the Carnegie Hall apartments, though I never did see one like Ali had. Also the scenes supposedly filmed in the Bronx was not a Bronx I was raised in but all of a sudden I was laughing and then being touched and going through layers of emotions.\n\nYes Viggo Mortensen as Tony Vallelonga and Mahershala Ali as Dr. Don Shirley are cliches in many scenes but they are both such good actors you believe what they are saying and doing not to forget the touch of family that Linda Cardellini as Tony's wife brings to an Italian Bronx thug who does love his wife and 2 sons, along with other family members.\n\nBased on a true story I must admit I had never heard of Dr. Don Shirley but his story of being a black entertainer who is going to travel through the south in 1962 it is reasonable that he would hire a Tony 'type' to be his chauffer and, in a sense, protector. A lot of cliches are nothing more than stereotypes and much what we see and hear of Shirley and Vallelonga sound and seem familiar which is sad because we aren't surprised.\n\n\"Green Book\" is being sold as 'a true story of a friendship' and it is just that with many laughs and tears supplied by two brilliant actors who bring more to the script than the script brings to them. There are a couple of scenes that took me by surprise which if talked about would mean spoilers and should be discovered on their own but one question I would love if anyone knows if  Mahershala does his own piano playing or is it Hollywood magic?\n\nBoth \"Green Book\" and \"The Hate U Give\" are two of the best films I have seen this autumn and though both deal with race they are completely different and also have leading performances that should get nominations , if not actual wins, for their performances.",

I never knew what a Green Book was, and I studied about segregation in high school and college and I didn\u2019t know gat it was, being a travel guide for colored people I was surprised by how normal it was for decent people to treat another person or people like that.

Shirley's struggle to overcome his prescribed black identity and the prejudiced qualities associated with it resonated deeply with me, though the conflict isn't resolved quite as well as it could be given how uncomfortably antagonistic Shirley's viewpoints against his own people can get. Similarly, Mortensen's Tony Lip, while incredibly acted, is limited in his overall development as he grows past the time period's rampant racism pretty quickly and without enough fanfare. The third act of the film suffers from some repetitive pacing as a result, never quite knowing when to cut a scene or just skip to the end.\nStill, these complaints are minor in the overall context of the great film, and will likely pass undetected by most viewers given how enjoyable 'Green Book' is.",

Building itself on a mix of light comedy and strong drama with a conciliatory tone, the film lacks much of the divisive polemics of recent Hollywood films on race relations, all without pulling any punches its display of white Southern racism.\n\nIn a similar manner as 2016's Moonlight, it also places much emotional weight on the \"black outsider\" whose cultural interests, sexual identity and outlook are at odds with both the commonplace white and black expectations of the conception of African-American cultural identity. In doing so, the film poses hard questions on all sides, helping it to eschew the more simplistic \"oppressor vs. oppressed\" narratives on race provided by the likes of Spike Lee, Ava DuVernay or Boots Riley.\n\nDespite this nicer way of exploring a contentious issue, Green Book's bright-eyed sentiment feel somewhat out of step with modern sensibilities in regard to social change. Coming off as being in between Driving Miss Daisy and The Help, Green Book services a desire to get past a certain nationality animosity (reflected in its widespread popularity among audiences) but appears more suited for an era where reason and decency are of a higher value than passion and rage. If you can, enjoy the conceptional conclusions of the film. If not, Blackkklansman is probably more to your liking. However, I prefer the former.",

But it was more a journey of acceptance on a personal level that made it successful across the board. Bring out the tissues if you cry easily coz I\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)m sure you will.

I was pleasantly rewarded not only by their acting, which was great as expected, but by the fun and emotional interactions between the characters. I had huge smiles on my face with some of their interactions, and a deep feeling of sadness during others. Again, they were great and were the main reason I give this movie a 7.25/10. My problems arise with the script. I just don\u2019t think the racism aspect was handled as well as it could have been outside the relationship of the two. All of the encounters with racist men and women felt a bit dumbed down and not as destructive as they should have been. Racism is a brutal subject, and I think it deserved to be shown that way and handled in a stronger way. While I understand this movie wanted to help the audience feel good and show that people can bond together, I definitely thought it could still do that while increasing the realistic aspect of the racism these people would have experienced, and therefore giving more respect to the two main characters for overcoming so much more than was shown. And the ending especially just kinda felt like a cop-out. Tony tells someone to be quiet about racism one time at the table and the whole family opens Mr. Shirley with open arms? Even if that\u2019s how it went down, that they all ate Xmas dinner together, I don\u2019t think the opinion of Mr. Shirley with some members of Tony\u2019s family shifted that quick. You knew what was going to happen because of what kind of movie it established itself as. I appreciate what the director and writers were going after and in no way do I see their portrayal of this story as racist, I just think it could have been a little more realistic and that would have made the film\u2019s impact even greater. +acting -script choices",

Whilst it might be easy to dismiss this as an inverted Driving Miss Daisy (with bits of My Fair Lady and Cyrano de Bergerac thrown in for good measure) this has a more politically aware and acceptable racial role reversal going for it. Through the eyes of Tony, we encounter a gradually escalating set of injustices and prejudices Shirley had to endure because of his skin colour as they head deeper south and via this enlightening experience, Tony goes through a redemptive arc that begins with him having similar prejudices due to his ignorance and finishes with him rejecting and turning around his erroneous ways just in time for Christmas. Pegged as a mainstream feel-good film, Farrelly, known previously for very different films when he was directing with his brother Bobby, brings a light touch to the subversive drama (another influence here I reckon is In the Heat of the Night) but equally surprising and astonishing are the transformative central performances by Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen, in which, shedding previous roles they are known for to inhibit almost polar opposite ones here, both actors show range unseen before in an impressive pair of portrayals that are believable, heart-warming and simply inspirational.",

I can definitely foresee this movie picking up a few nominations come awards season. I thought the story kept my interest and the movie balanced dramatic and humorous moments well.
