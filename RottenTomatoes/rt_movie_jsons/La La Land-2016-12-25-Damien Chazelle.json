It's basically what the ending represents, it's the big \"what if?\"\nOther than that this work left me enchanted with its very well done musical numbers.

            "content": "\"La La Land\" is a romantic musical drama released in 2016, written and directed by Damien Chazelle. The movie stars Ryan Gosling as Sebastian, a jazz pianist, and Emma Stone as Mia, an aspiring actress. The film follows their love story and their struggle to pursue their dreams in Hollywood.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of \"La La Land\" is the stunning cinematography and the mesmerizing musical numbers. The film's use of bright colors, dynamic camera movements, and creative lighting create a dreamy and immersive atmosphere that transports the audience into the world of the film. The musical numbers are beautifully choreographed and performed, and the songs are catchy and memorable.\n\nThe acting is also a highlight of the movie, with Gosling and Stone delivering strong performances that showcase their chemistry and emotional range. Both actors bring depth and nuance to their characters, and their portrayal of the ups and downs of a romantic relationship is both believable and moving.\n\nThe direction by Damien Chazelle is also noteworthy. He masterfully weaves together the different elements of the film, from the musical numbers to the character development, creating a cohesive and engaging narrative. The pacing of the film is excellent, with each scene flowing seamlessly into the next.\n\nHowever, one of the criticisms of \"La La Land\" is its portrayal of jazz and its historical context. Some critics have argued that the film oversimplifies the genre and fails to recognize the contributions of African American musicians to its development. Additionally, some viewers may find the ending of the film bittersweet and disappointing.\n\nOverall, \"La La Land\" is a visually stunning and emotionally powerful musical romance that showcases the talents of its cast and crew. While it may not be without its flaws, the film is a triumph of modern filmmaking that is sure to captivate audiences with its beautiful music, impressive visuals, and heartfelt story.",

            "content": "Damien Chazelle's Oscar-winning musical 'La La Land' is a colourful story that follows aspiring performers as they embark on a whirlwind journey navigating their careers in bustling Los Angeles. The film brings together both classic Hollywood and modern surroundings in an appealing blend of visual styles.\n\nEmma Stone stars as Mia Dolan, a struggling actress who spends her time working in a coffee shop and booking unsuccessful auditions. When Mia meets jazz enthusiast and aspiring club owner Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling), the two quickly begin a passionate romance. But when the pursuit of their dreams begins to tug at their relationship, they must choose between their once-in-a-lifetime romance or their dream careers.\n\nComing off the success of his 2014 drama 'Whiplash', Damien Chazelle takes a more colourful spin in the director's chair as he gives viewers a magical story fuelled by aspiration and sacrifice. Set against a modern-day Los Angeles backdrop, Chazelle brings these two characters to life in a bold, passionate experience that is a visual feast. The 128-minute runtime allows Stone and Gosling to take viewers on a touching journey that features vivid cinematography and extravagant musical numbers. Chazelle's unique directing style is evident throughout, with smooth, uninterrupted takes being scattered across the film.\n\nWhen the 2017 Academy Awards rolled around, it was no surprise that 'La La Land' would be the most colourful nomination out of the nominees. The lighting and costume design give the film a polychromatic look that appeals to viewers of all ages. As well as incorporating older filmmaking techniques, Chazelle draws inspiration from classic films like 'The Young Girls of Rochefort' and 'Singin' in the Rain' - all of which feature outdoor dances. Despite being taken along on the loved up journey between Sebastian and Mia, viewers can't help but feel distanced from the characters. The lack of backstory prevents viewers from being able to form a close attachment to these characters.\n\nThemes like following your dreams and dreams vs reality seem to be at the forefront of 'La La Land'. Repetitive shots and circular narratives show Sebastian and Mia's journey across the film, even the film's locations plays into the film's morals. Although Los Angeles may be the 'city of dreams', to achieve your aspirations you may still have to make sacrifices. The film leaves its ending up to interpretation, whilst on one hand, you can see the true ending, a homage to the perfect Hollywood ending, or you can see it as a look into what could've been in store for Sebastian and Mia.\n\nDespite Gosling and Stone giving sensational performances, believe it or not, neither were the original choices for their respective roles. Gosling's role was supposed to be played by Miles Teller, who previously worked with Chazelle in 'Whiplash'. Stone's role was originally filled by Emma Watson, who, due to scheduling conflicts, had to drop out. Fans of both Gosling and Stone can watch the pair in the 2011 rom-com 'Crazy, Stupid, Love', and the 2013 thriller 'Gangster Squad'.\n\nIn conclusion, 'La La Land' is an extravagant, bittersweet combination of classic cinema and modern filmmaking. The film makes use of its talented cast in more ways than one, as the leads take on musical roles alongside performative ones and manage to provide a pleasant viewing experience.",

First, La La Land's music created an impression beyond words that stays fresh even after years. There are 15 songs in the movie. I love the song at the very beginning of the movie called\" Another Day of Sun\" which carry the message of never giving up your dream's up. On contrary, if you are not a big musical movie lover, watching La La Land could be big torture for you.Second, I like how the movie poses an unconventional ending as a romantic movie. Compared to most romantic movies which tend to have an idealistic ending- the prince and princess live happily ever after. Third, unlike most romantic movies, La La Land has no R-rated scene. Yet, the romantic comedy element captured the romance well. The director plotted the process in which Mia and Seb fell in love in witty and charming ways. \nLastly, as an international student who came to a different country to accomplish my goals and dreams, watching this film has given me a more personal connection. For romantic relationships, I can resonate well with the dilemma of dream and love. After watching this movie, I rethink my priority of putting family and love in front of career goals. This movie also provides great strength for me to realize my goal as I listen to the movie songs over and over.",

I found it hard to sympathize with Emma Stone's character's acting career objective with all these false notes.  (2) The only dialogue I liked was John Legend's character's criticism of Ryan Gosling's character's view of jazz and opening a jazz club. Since I share this doubt about the sense of opening a jazz club, I could not sympathize with the lead male's objective in the film.  (3) I focused on the film's use of color and jazz music to stay engaged with this film.

The movie does an incredible job of making a modern musical that pays homage to classic cinema.

Stand here, line there. Okay sing now--but not too well because you're not a broadway singer, and don't sing an interesting song either (I couldn't hum a single tune from the show except the opening of that very slow piano song they played three separate times). It just felt lacking. Like they should have hired performers instead of actors, or re-worked the songs/cinematography a bit to be more interesting. I mean come on--in the big climax of the film she stands there and sing/tells a story. I don't think she changed expression or moved once and that's supposed to be the audition that finally lands her a role?? It was unbelievable. But even if it had been believable it was unlikeable.

Similar to Chazeeles another musically focused masterpiece \"Whiplash\" he focuses on self-sacrifice. In Whiplash Neiman gave up his character to become a drumming great, In La La Land Mia and Sebastian give up their love to pursue different dreams. In Whiplash, there's a little glimpse of this theme with Neiman breaking ties with his girlfriend to focus on drumming but Mia and Sebastian's love is the key focus here. It ends on a bittersweet note that's shown incredibly. Both achieve their goals but due to the time and focus it takes to do that they split away. Unlike most relationships ending Mia and Sebastian have no lost love, There is still a deep love and care for each other in the end. There is a stunning showcase of what could've been between these two if the world really was a so-called \"La La Land\" where love and happiness prosper over all, but it grounds the viewer in a painful truth. The genre its plot is set it baits and almost traps the viewer in a false security that all will work out in the end. The bursting colors, happy songs, and romantic dances all by you into the \"La La Land\" All the factors that work towards this is nothing short of filmmaking genius, impeccable directing. The performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were great, with strong chemistry between both. The performances, music, dances and perfectly executed plot makes La La Land one of the finest Musicals to come out in recent history, if not the best.",

The contrast between the fantastical dance scenes and the relatable problems the characters experience is simply delightful. I caught myself forgetting that this was simply a movie. If the pop color doesn't entertain you the soundtrack is absolutely astounding. Most of the bad reviews I hear about this movie are from people who can't admit to themselves that enjoying a musical is okay.",

That would be story, character and pacing.  The two leads are as appealing as cardboard, no fault of the actors.  That's how they were written and directed.  The story is basic as you get and the pacing is non-existed.  Instead of \"Singin' In The Rain\", we get \"An American In Paris\".  No wonder this was an Oscar darling, whenever these characters have feelings, it's forced melodrama with no comedy or entertainment.  But I'll give credit where credit is due, the songs and dances are very good.  Just everything is else is lousy.",

            "content": "Having just gotten back from seeing 'La La Land', with a rare day off music college, it came to me that it was one of the best new release/first viewings for me in a while.\n\nVery few films in recent memory has left me leave the cinema with my heart properly warmed, a beaming smile on my face, tears in my eyes, feeling uplifted and properly moved. 'La La Land' however has managed that feat. Would also go further to say that it is one of the best modern film musicals after Disney's Renaissance period in the 90s, and very much a modern classic. Am not surprised at all its award wins and nominations (including being a record breaker at the Golden Globes), and if it does well at the Oscars as well there will be no complaints from me.\n\n'La La Land' clicked with me most likely because of my love for golden age Hollywood, musicals (a somewhat maligned genre these days, but while there are a fair share of not particularly good ones there are a bigger number of great ones and even masterpieces), and how it fondly reminded me of what makes me love them so much. Also because of being able to relate to its themes and conflicts, due to being there myself. The talent was also appetising, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, directed by 'Whiplash's' Damien Chazelle and featuring cameo support from JK Simmons (who coincidentally won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 'Whiplash), John Legend and Rosemarie DeWitt.\n\nIt was just sheer joy to see a film with so much potential deliver on that potential and even more so, having seen a lot of stuff recently film and TV that wasted their potential it was refreshing to see a film actually delivering on it.\n\nVisually, 'La La Land' is a gorgeous-looking film, with lots of vibrant colour that leap out at you from the screen while not having too much of a dizzying effect and cinematography that's not just a dream to behold but inventively done without falling into self-indulgent territory. The music and songs may induce, and has induced, mixed reactions, count me in as somebody who found the songs infectious, emotion-filled and with enough to make one top-tap and hum along.\n\nThe musical numbers are winningly choreographed too with non-stop exuberance. The opening number is especially true to this. The script is warm, funny, affectionate and poignant, and also with an honesty. It's not a complex script, nor did it need to be, and neither does it make the mistake of being too simple. The story is admittedly slight in places, then again so were the stories of even the best golden age musicals and they still managed to be classics because of how everything else was executed and because of the atmosphere.\n\nSomething that is true with 'La La Land', a film where anybody can relate to its themes. Even more special though is that not only does it pay tribute to musicals and films of the golden age (especially those with MGM), with their bold colour, exuberant marriage of music and dance, it also has a winsomeness and melancholic nature seen in films like 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg' yet does it in a way that will appeal hugely to modern audiences. Loved that the two leads' relationship and chemistry was much more complex than the love-at-first-sight sort (far from it, more antagonists turned lovers) with a meet cute first encounter (again also not a case).\n\nChazelle's direction shows someone with a sheer love for film and film-making, more than evident in execution that is affectionate and full-of-life rather than self-indulgent. The chemistry between the two leads and their performances would need to be good to make the film work. No worries there. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone look so natural and at ease together, nothing looks false and it is easy to root for them and their conflicts.\n\nBoth of them give terrific performances, performances so good that less than great singing was immediately forgotten about. Especially Stone who has never been better in a performance of great expressivity and nuance, so many emotions such as vulnerability, strength, cheekiness, charm and buoyancy with never a hint of a heavy-handed touch. Gosling matches her, if not quite as good, showing a very charismatic presence and an effortless twinkling charm. All the support, although basically cameos, registers memorably.\n\nAll in all, a dream come true and totally banishes any blues and daily troubles away. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I'm writing this review after I have lost count of just how many times I've seen this film in it's entirety, much less in the snippets of is musical sequences or even dramatic ones at that. La La Land is a film that never loses its touch. No matter how many times I view it, I always ponder on what could've been, just how Mia and Sebastian do in the final scene.\n\nTo begin, the cast is essentially just Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) who's romance simply never fails to captivate. They simply seem so perfect and made for one another, but yet they're not meant to be together. At a certain point in the film, Sebastian takes Mia to a Jazz club in hopes that she learns the beauty of Jazz music. As they listen to Jazz live, Sebastian states, \"It's conflict, and it's compromise, and it's just... it's NEW every time. It's brand-new every night. It's very, very exciting. And it's dying. It's dying, Mia. It's dying on the vine.\" After countless rewatching, that quote almost represents Mia and Sebastian's relationship throughout the film. From the clashing of Mia not liking jazz, and Sebastian not wanting to name his club \"Seb's\" to the compromising of Mia learning about Jazz through Sebastian and Sebastian naming his club \"Deb's\" due to Mia. Every time we see the pair on screen it's a new thing for them, something new to do or something new that's happening to them and it's very exciting to see... until slowly but surely it dies. On the vine.\n\nDamien Chazelle (Director) makes La La Land feel dreamy and at times, quite literally out-of-this world with the phenomenal musical acts and choreography being placed in magical settings. The feeling of each sequence and film feeling quite literally like the state of their relationship. On top of that, Score composer Justin Hurwitz made some beautiful beautiful pieces of music that fit so elegantly every step of the way. In order to achieve such beautiful images, there is Cinematographer Linus Sandgren to thank for that. All in all, one of the most delightfully pleasing films of all time with an ending that makes you feel as though love can't exist at all.\n\nIn the end, La La Land proves itself as it continues to stand strong within the realm of musicals, romance, and drama without ever becoming cheesy or repetitive. An absolutely phenomenal and gorgeous film that belongs to a city of stars.",

La banda sonora y las canciones son pegajosas y alegres, las coreograf\u00edas est\u00e1n magistralmente dirigidas, actuadas y filmadas con largos planos secuencia y movimientos de c\u00e1mara sumamente ambiciosos.

If you don't like a movie that's a musical, then this isn't for you, I'll bet anyone any money that Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel would say the same thing. I found this movie very entertaining, but it's not a movie that should be an Oscar winner or Golden Globe winner. It does have a good story, but it's not strong enough for the Oscars or Golden Globe awards, at least in my opinion. Whenever you see a movie like this that's a musical, never pay attention too the paid movie critics reviews, pay attention too the audience reviews instead. Any paid movie critic who is from an online newspaper should get no attention. We have the internet now, social media and movie reviewing/tv show reviewing websites like here on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB. We don't need too listen too the paid movie critics' nonsense. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling do a good job with their performances and the cinematography and directing is on cue. The screenplay told the story well. The style of the movie is also good. But again, this kind of a movie is for people who like musicals. I highly recommend this movie for movie fans who like/love musicals, but if you're not into musicals, that's okay, you can skip this one and find another movie that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have done that isn't a musical. All in all, a good and very entertaining picture.",

They present fully fleshed out characters as compared to most movie musicals where characters are less developed and are more or less simply character archetypes. The old fashioned Gershwin-like score and songs are terrific and Emma Stone has a surprisingly good breathy singing voice. Even if Gosling is less talented in the singing department, he makes up for it with a fine performance. Although\"La La Land\" does bring some welcome realism to it's story not typically seen in musicals, it does not go nearly as dark or subversive as Jacques Demy's \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" or Martin Scorsese's \"New York, New York\" which were more a deconstruction of the musical as a genre. Overall, \"La La Land\" is a charming throwback for fans of old fashioned movie musicals, even if it's more of a novelty than a true classic. Still, I have to admit I prefer Peyton Reed's homage to Rock Hudson and Doris Day films with his \"Down with Love\" which although wasn't really a musical outside of the one closing number, but it's throwback feel was far more nostalgic for me.",

            "content": "An absolute tour de force! One of the most endearing musicals known to man-kind and almost flawless in every way. La La Land follows an aspiring actress and musician who cross paths and bond over their shared passion to achieve their dreams. This is without a doubt the heart and soul of the movie, the acting performances delivered by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are outstanding and the chemistry they shared was a delight to watch! It's incredibly moving to see them open up to each other and express their emotions to one another. The musical segments involving them are an absolute joy as well as you just can't help but smile from ear to ear when they start dancing! Speaking of musical segments, they're all wonderfully done, from the music to the dance choreography to the range of emotions shown off, it's all phenomenal and makes you wanna get up and start dancing yourself! The cinematography, costume design and setting were all executed with such finesse! The lighting and angles used in certain shots is just mind-boggling, from the auditorium scene to the jazz club sequence, you can't help but be amazed! The different time jumps and how they showcase it through the outfits worn by the cast is just as remarkable and improves the immersion drastically and didn't hamper the experience in the slightest. Another thing this movie does fantastically is its interpretation of how we as humans strive to achieve our dreams, it almost brings a tear to your eyes. How they showcase both Mia and Sebastian's drive to achieve those dreams is surprisingly realistic and goes to show that we as humans can achieve anything if we set our mind to it. The pacing was also brisk and upbeat, while it isn't fast-paced, it still isn't boring, every scene feels important to the overarching plot and it never feels like they're panning out the run time. You never get bored whilst watching and you're always interested to see where the story goes next. Finally, the ending was mature, slightly melancholic but still absolutely satisfying! We see how Sebastian and Mia grew apart. However, in the final moments, they see each other one final time, but it isn't a sorrowful moment, it's instead reassuring as they give each other one final glance to signal that they're happy for each other that they both ended up achieving what they set out to do. La La Land is one of those rare movies that remind us why we love cinema to begin with. Such a beautiful, mature and deeply moving film could've never been made if the crew behind it didn't pour their heart and soul into the project! Everyone truly gave it their all and it's a miracle such a movie exists to begin with. Taking all these facts into account, it isn't a shocker it won twelve Oscars! Truly one of the greatest movies of all time!",

So it is in that spirit that I invite anyone to enlighten me on the seemingly universal love for  \"La La Land.\" \nSimply put: I just don't get it.  \nThe fantasy elements, the dance numbers the jazz score and the chemistry of the two leads are all terrific.  The final montage is beautifully done. Even the song lyrics, when not being over-powered by the score, are very nice.  But the story is such a slog and neither Gosling nor Stone have a strong enough voice to carry the show.  \nBoth City of Stars and A Beautiful Night maybe lovely and even \"catchy\" tunes, but they are delivered without any conviction. Gosling sings everything under his breath and Emma's timid little voice only gets going at the end of her last number and by then - it was too late for me. \nI grew up on movie musicals: Westside Story, The Music Man, Bye Bye Birdie. I love the more recent ones like Little Shop of Horrors, Chicago, Les Miserables and even Into the Woods.  Just listen to Ellen Green sing \"Suddenly Seymour\" and \"Somewhere That's Green\" or Rene' Zellwigger's \"Roxie,\" or Hathaway's \"I Dreamed a Dream.\" There are no showstoppers or defining moments like those in La La Land, much to my supreme disappointment.   It's not a bad movie but neither is it a great musical, no matter how much Hollywood fawns all over it.",

            "content": "This movie is and will forever be a masterpiece, not only because of the music but also the photography, the acting, the whole story of Mia and Sebastian. Their grownth as individuals while persuing their dreams  is palpable. So real. So true. We won't do the best for us and at the same time for our partner every single time. Turns out what we thought was the best for both, may be not for neither. Some times we comit mistakes. Other times we comit the worst of our entire lifes. And we can't always help it. It's so sad when you feel there's no space for you, your dreams and the dreams of your partner in a relationship (I cried a lot because of it). Life is not always kind to us. Destiny can be a luck, but also a bad luck. But i think, at the end, they found a way to support each other, what was very difficult back then when they were together. They made it in the final scene (Sebastian by chance. Mia without even notice. Both without the primary intention to do it). Maybe the timing wasn't right. Maybe they don't belong together. Maybe they did. Who knows? Even apart, they were a crucial part of each others dreams. Love is L.U.V.: Listening, Understanding and Validating. And I think that was exactly what they did. She fought with him because she knew he wasn't following his dreams. She understood his passion, she validated it because she listened how much it meant to him since the beginning. He got mad because he was willing to sacrifice his dreams for hers and thought he was doing what would make her happy. He validated her dreams too, but listened more to his fears than to her, what she wanted from him: to be there with her when she needed him. The true is that they could only be truly happy if both could see both dreams coming true. They unsdertood that and validated that. But it's not that easy to have everything. Real life it's not flowers and glitter all the time. We need to make our choices and to live with the consequences of it. They couldn't say \"My dream is more worth the try than yours, you need to sacrifice yours so I can live mine.\"  or \"I don't need my dream coming true to be happy, we can live just yours.\" I mean, they could, but the would never do it to each other. And they shouldn't, cause both still needed that. They needed their dreams. So, their happiness for the other one at the end is pure and genuine. They made their choices: they let each other go to live their lifes, to achieve their goals. And they did! And so well done. They were proud of each other. At that moment, they saw with their own eyes that their paths were crossed years ago with a purpose: to not let each other give up on their dream. And, surprisily, life was kind at the end (after being really tough earlier). Life let Mia see Sebs living his dream and Sebs see Mia living hers too. I know that moment hurted like HELL to watch, but they needed that. After all, they sacrificed their love to their dreams to come true, didn't they? They deserved to see each other happiness. \"La la land\" is about the cost of our dreams, the understading that everything happens for a reason even if it's not in the way we wanted, the consequences of our choices and what we are able to do to see the people we love happy. What is true love? Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were impeccable. Emma is always astonishing, Ryan was amazing and improvised so damn well. \"People love what other people are passionate about.\" That's why they fell in love with each other. And that's why I am in love with this movie since 2016.",

From the direction, to performances, to a darn amazing soundtrack, \"La La Land\" checks all the marks to becoming a critic darling at awards season.\n\nSadly, of course, we all remember what happened the night of the Oscars. But I genuinely believe that this movie will live on, not because of that plunder, but because of the content itself. It's a modern movie musical. Many movies such as \"Hairspray\" and \"Moulin Rouge\" have tried to revive that classic romantic genre, but in my opinion, only \"La La Land\" truly succeeded at this. At times, I forgot that this movie is set in modern times as I found myself reminiscent of the classics, most notably \"Singing In The Rain\".\n\nOne thing I absolutely adore about it is the ending. While tragic, it also just seems authentic. Things don't always work out in real life. Lovers don't always have their happily ever afters like in the fairy tales. We see a tragic montage of what could've been and the tears begin to fall down the audience's faces.\n\nOverall, this movie has a perfect blend of comedy, romance, drama, incredible choreography, beautiful melodies, and phenomenal performances by the leads.",

The love story was great, the song & dance numbers were excellent, the vivid & saturated color palette was perfect and the comedic elements were well-done. I would've preferred they find a bigger role for J.K. Simmons as he's one of my favorite actors but I can see how it was necessary to minimize him when he was so important to Chazelle's last movie. I imagine this will end up being Chazelle & Hurwitz's magnum opus as they seem born to make this movie, and now they have. Emma's performance grew on me as the movie went on as she really showed a ton of range here, with the whole movie riding on her nailing her performance the way she did. I was less enamored with Gosling, who I've always thought was rather overrated and whose character was given dissatisfyingly rude traits like holding the horn down for no reason whatsoever; his creative differences with Legend came off as awkward and his facial expressions remained subdued the entire movie. The middle of the movie did lag a bit as they stopped doing as many songs and tried to turn my anti-frown upside down, but overall I loved watching this!",

Emma Stone can be a bit hit/miss, combining an occasional relatability with repetitive over-acting. Ryan Gosling has always been a favorite of mine, for his versatility in playing either quiet loners or aggressive hardcases. He is more of a French shower in this one. The screenplay allows the two stars plenty to get their acts on in natural, fast exchanges. The two have history, and their chemistry brings the film up. I'd honestly forgotten about Simmons being in this, Oscar winner for Whiplash. He is always welcome, even if squandered here. John Legend also shows up. Yeah.\n\nLet's get this out of the way: the musical numbers here are nothing remotely special. I don't mean to slag Hurwitz off in any way, but every time the music begins I had the urge to skip. Gosling has dabbled in music, but he cannot support Stone's clear lack of \"the voice\" and fails to convince himself. The set designs and choreography occasionally make up for this shortcoming, but most of the time it is putting lipstick on a pig. The songs do not revolt, but do not entice in the way clearly intentioned by including them in the first place. I must note that most of the jazzy solo instrumentals are decent and the Love Theme is beautiful.\n\nThe story almost transcends the poor musical sequences. The simplicity of two well-matched leads falling in love and then drifting apart against the backdrop of LA. We have a sense of realism against a juxtaposition of magic, comedy, genuinely touching romance, and escapism. For that, the film is unique and cannot be ignored, as it wasn't in the awards.",

There is a fantastic surrealist blend of movie and stage elements, along with a great use of color for a truly innovative visual production.  For a musical about a musician however, the music leaves much to be desired.  While perfectly well written in a vacuum, there is sloppy integration between narrative and song, with a disturbing lack \"pure jazz\" that Gosling's character professes to care so much about.  With the writers' seeming failure to have any interactions with a real musician as research, the film's story is doomed to be a narrow minded caricature of an LA beatnik and the \"dying art\" of jazz.",

Though joyous, the movie was also very bittersweet - which hit me particularly hard due to the tangent the narrative had with my own life at that point in time.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e, who was my friend back then, was someone that I feared would only be in my life for a glimpse moment because I couldn't imagine that she liked me - yet I had incredibly strong emotions for her that I had never felt in my life prior. Eventually, she also started dating another guy during our friendship - which made my life a living hell. Given the context, I strongly related my struggles to the struggles of Ryan's character as he dealt with the same, especially towards the end wherein the love of his life ended up with another guy.\n\nLuckily, I didn't end up with the same fate as Ryan's character.. Nonetheless, it's still a movie that I have a lot of emotions tied to. All in all, a great and memorable movie. More so for me due to how it reflected my own life at the point of watching it.",

This movie is also enhanced by many musical elements with stunning musical dance numbers and cinematography that is just like clouds in a dream. The soundtrack is just beyond great and deserves all the recognition that it earned. When this movie was being advertised I had no interest to see it, I went to go see it just randomly on a Friday night and I was blown away by what Damian Chazelle manage to create. For Someone that is not interested in Jazz, this gave me a new perspective on the genre and made me appreciate it.

The history, cast, scenography, music, all under an excellent direction that knew how to join each of these aspects to make a work of art that transmits emotions that seem as contrary as happiness and sadness with a single scene.\nFirst, the story plays along the line of clich\u00e9 without falling into it and that is what makes it so special, it shows us the ease and simplicity which we can come across someone who will change our lives, but also shows how that person can last long enough to become a burden, how we should be left behind certain things, adding a touch of nostalgia, the famous \"What would have happened if...?\".\nThe cast is wonderful, the roles of Mia and Sebastian seem like they were made specifically for Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. They do an impressive  job, Emma giving Mia joy, spontaneity and charisma, and Ryan giving Sebastian that serious, sarcastic and persevering personality. In addition there are good performances from John Legend, Jessica Rothe, JK Simmons, among others.\nThe scenography is a phenomenal job, it shows us amazing views of Hollywood with an excellent choice of colors that makes us feel exactly the emotion they want, and with all other aspects to take us right to that moment.\nThe music is divine, it's the best thing of the movie, Justin Hurwitz did an impeccable job combining the Jazz style with orchestra. Songs that transmit a thousand emotions by themselves, for example \"The fools who dream\" or \"Someone in the crowd\", added to the excellent visual work. The soundtrack and its title song \"City of Stars\" were decorated at the academy awards.\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this film that envelops you and makes you feel identified with each of the characters. Art that we can appreciate and enjoy through the eyes and ears. Of course, backed by nothing more and nothing less than 6 academy awards and 7 Golden Globes, just to mention some of its 88 awards.",

My favorite scene would definitely be when the two - Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling - start dancing in the planetarium. Emma dancing along with the music with her stunning white dress left me in awe. But I would also pick the starting scene as one of the most iconic scenes ever. How they begin with the normal, dull traffic jam that is probably common in the city from what I heard, but ends up filming a whole musical themselves all of a sudden and I thought that was a great way to start off a movie, especially one like this one as much as it is a musical film. Though what I really liked about the whole storyline was how the main character ends up following her dream, rather than choosing love over what she really wants to accomplish. The two decide to follow what they have been dreaming of accomplishing thougb they share the same amount of love and affection towards each other. Unlike many different movies nowadays, I thought that aspect of being realistic was very special and what made the movie become more popular. Those kinds of parts and stories are what the audience prefer since it is what they can relate to. We watch movies not only to just enjoy the actors or the story, but to relate to something because in my case, movies are what I go to whenever I feel lonely and feel like I have no one to talk to.

Before watching this movie, I thought that it would be no different from many other romance movies that fill the fantasy of love. So I didn't really want to see it, but I watched it late because it was such a famous movie. However, this movie captures great stories, beautiful scene, and good music as well as the message to the audience. I regret watching this movie now.\nActually, I don't usually like musical movie, but it is exception. This is because songs in musical films often break the movie's immersion, while the song in this movie made the love between the Mia and Sebastian feel more romantic. Especially, the song \u2018Audition'' is the most memorable. \nIn my view, the best scene in this movie is the ending. Although their love did not come true, their eyes after achieving their dreams left the longest lingering impression even if there were no lines. The ending of this movie is very realistic, but I think it is the reason why this movie is special.",

The performances from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are brilliantly done, and I can personally relate to Ryan's character (Sebastian) a lot because of his ethics and what he stands for. That directly relates to the message of the film which is essentially to never give up on your dreams and passions. Special mention to the cinematography in the film, shot by Linus Sandgren, which is mesmerising at times with how LA looks. Finally, the climatic 20/25 minutes of the film is special and the perfect way to conclude this story. The first time I saw it I was not a huge fan, but now after multiple watches I am now convinced this was the way to finish. One of my all-time favourite films!

I still listen to the soundtracks 'City of Stars', 'Mia and Seb'. I am frequently playing the tunes in my head, Seb's piano is hands down my favourite, ever so that I started learning piano online and ended when I could play the first part of 'Mia & Seb'\n\nThe long-take dance had masterful choreography and we can see a lot of hard work went into the film.\nThe Purple Sky LA is one the greatest cinematography I have seen, each image could be printed out and seen as ART.\nThe acting of Ryan and Emma was first-class, speacialy Emma in the audition scene. The chemistry is one the best, there is music scene where Ryan messes something up but they both laugh it off and still continue \u2764\n\nRomance films with tragedy/break ups are always my favourites as they stick with me for longer time. This movie is speacial because of the 'What if' sequence. That scene is the most relatable thing I have ever seen in my life.\nI recommend this movie to a person and I still have 'What if' scenarioes of my own with her.\n\nThis is one of those movies I promise myself to see every year.",

This imitates the \u2018happily ever after' endings of traditional Hollywood films which push forward the ideology that everything seems to fall into place in favor of the characters. In a way, the \u2018what could have been' sequence serves as an inter-textual representation of Hollywood films in general which almost always have endings that juxtapose reality, or in this case the reality in the film that Mia and Sebastian did not get their happily ever after.",

Maybe it's because I wasn't entirely impressed by Emma Stone's performance or MAYBE the ending turned me off too much (the alternative ending was great though)! Or maybe I just don't like Damien Chazelle films. It's not like First Man (2018) agreed with me either!\n\nSomething that (I later realised) pleases/frustrates me about this film is the attention it brings to a somewhat dying genre; one filled with culture, history and a loose rhythm: jazz. Sebastian touches on how it's become a thing of the past (\"It's conflict and compromise.\") but it's over too fast and you leave the theaters almost forgetting that jazz was even mentioned in the first place. Then again, I could just be a bit of a jazz fanatic \u2026",

            "content": "April 22nd, 2021: WATCHED THE ENTIRE FILM, determined to give it a chance! I can sorta remember one song, \"City of Stars\". Emma (those eyes!) and Ryan (someone's been working out!) are very good actors but aren't trained dancers (that's okay, really and Ryan not quite landing those pinwheels sorta charming and I backed up DVD and watched dance scene set over L.A. several times) or trained vocalists (that's okay, Pierce Bronson sort of charmingly off-key in \"Mama Mia\"). The 'snow' added some magic, but was it cocaine at the pool?  John Legend fine at...being John Legend (but a no-name would have worked better.) I really liked the last 10 minutes with the bittersweet double-end. But the biggest problem here is that I didn't much want to watch Hollywood self-pleasure itself for two hours. I've raised my rating from 1/2 star to 2 stars though.  I like musicals, might try it again! (Oh, the charmingly awful L.A. apartments for Emma and Ryan were amazingly perfect at the beginning of the film, that's unusual.) I might eventually come to love this one, I'm trying! (But why oh why is that opening song so...awful?)\n2020, TRIED TO WATCH ENTIRE FILM on DVD: Kept thinking things like: \"that looks like the choreography from West Side Story\" and \"this song is terrible and the dancing is Way off\" (go ahead, hum one song, give it a try) and then I snoozed off about an hour in.\n2017,ORIGINAL REVIEW: Unfortunately, I saw (the first 30 minutes or so) right after the monumental \"Moonlight\" at AMC's Best Picture Showcase and thought, after the first 3 musical numbers of La La Land: \"this is the worst musical I've ever seen, even worse than 'Grease 2', and besides this is just terrible compared to Moonlight, and left. I'd have asked for my money back, but I felt like \"La La Land\"  was chasing me so I ran to my car and drove away.",

            "content": "\"La La Land\" is simply overflowing with joy. Writer-director Damien Chazelle accomplishes this through the use of homage and pastiche, evoking prior sights and sounds from classic musicals like \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"West Side Story.\" In addition to invoking the exuberance of older styles, Chazelle adds a layer of realism to his film that its influences lacked. Chazelle is not a strict traditionalist holding onto the past, he is a revolutionary, as John Legend's character Keith similarly tells Sebastian. Yes, there is a riveting opening number, a dance sequence that defies gravity, and charming duets between Mia and Sebastian, but there are also scenes when characters get fired from their jobs and decide to give up on their dreams: \"Maybe I'm not good enough!\u2026 Maybe I'm one of those people that has always wanted to do it, but it's like a pipe dream for me,\" Mia laments to Sebastian. In a similar fashion, the film's ending reminds us of the fleeting nature of love. Due to this perfect blend of realism and surrealism, \"La La Land\" has a magic of its own. (\"It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting!\") It is a passionate ode to cinema made for and by \"The Fools Who Dream\" that precisely captures their tortured plight. \"La La Land\" is pure cinematic bliss.",

However, I feel the reason I enjoyed this movie so much is the same reason I enjoyed When Harry Met Sally: rom-coms are something of a guilty pleasure for me.

The duo of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were even more electric than they are in real life. With Damien's extensive knowledge of such classics as Singin' in the Rain, Broadway Melody of 1940 and Sweet Charity, La La Land shines with a brilliant mixture of comebacks and new material. With 5 Oscar wins, I feel like the film was short changed and should have won at least 8, including Best Picture. If La La Land is not one of the best movies in history, it certainly is one of the best since the turn of the century.",

I didn't care if they got together romantically or if they succeeded in achieving their dreams.  I guess I was supposed to give a crap because they are two young, white, attractive people, but eff that crap.  Also, it figures that fake, phony-ass Hollywood would do a movie about some young, white, attractive man doing the black people a favor by championing  their music, jazz.  This would have been a much better movie if jazzhole Seb had just strangled Mia to death after finding out that she hated jazz.  That would have been more in line with his character.  And, oh yeah, before I forget, the \"City of Stars\" song featured prominently in this movie absolutely sucks and it isn't even jazz!  Just another overrated movie.  Just made in America trash.",

Finally I have to remake the amazing performance of Ryan Gosling adn Emma Stone, they were born to interprete this characters, you can feel the conection that this incredible actors have, you can feel all the emotions are experiencieng in every scene you can be Mia, or Sebastian, even you could be both but more than this you will absolutelly love them.

The story I found to be quite predictable, but still gripping, especially in the third act.\n\nThe acting was also really strong, especially Emma Stone as Mia, I found that she portrayed the character really well and gave a gripping performance.\n\nThe worst aspect of the film for me was the characters, mostly because I found them to be quite bland and sometimes even unlikable, but luckily I can say that they weren't the worst characters I've ever seen.\n\nThe cinematography was also really strong and stylistic, with some great shots of the characters and scenery. My personal favourite shot was one toward the end of the film involving Sebastian playing the piano in a spot light.\n\nThe sets in my opinion were also one of the best aspects of the film, especially in the final scenes toward the end.\n\nThe style of the film I personally found to be incredibly strong and stylistic, from the colour scheme and cinematography, to the direction and music.\n\nSpeaking of music, this film in my opinion has a really good and vibrant soundtrack. The music was both written and played really well, especially the one song City of Stars.\n\nThe film also had some very strong atmosphere, especially in the third act with Sebastian and Mia.\n\nThe choreography in the film was also really strong, especially the opening scene with the song Another Day of Sun.\n\nThe film I also very much enjoyed, and I hope to watch it again soon.\n\nOver all I give it a \n8/10",

However, I came away feeling that the sole reason to see this film is to bask in the amazing shots - it is truly a beautiful film. Lighting, staging, color and photography are all top notch, and sometimes transcendent. There is a regularly displayed love of the dolly shot through the film (though in today's tech-wizard film,making, I kept wondering if the oft-used fast-pan was a digital way of cutting between takes, or if it was an actual pan). Disappointingly, everything else gets in the way of the beauty that this film displays. I was surprised that awards were given out for the acting, as it seemed as lacking in depth as the painfully hackneyed plot. I couldn't sympathize with either character as they were both insufferable with no redeeming traits other than their attractiveness (which, to be fair, is commonly the case with struggling LA actors and musicians - but this isn't supposed to be a gritty reality film). I actively wanted their relationship to fail and I usually like silly romantic films (my fave film in the romantic genre is Somewhere in Time). This is a musical, but musicals require BIG songs that you keep humming as you leave the theater and that you want to hear again (think The Music Man, Oliver, West Side Story, Mary Poppins). However, the music in this film was either un-hummable jazz (yes, I do like jazz) or insipid, forgettable songs that I wanted to be over as fast as possible. The vocalists were adequate singers in a bland current-pop sort of way, but that's not how its done in musicals. They're working in a medium that gave us Garland, Minelli, Streisand, Kelly, Preston...these poor La La actors just don't rate.  But, oh - those visuals. They are so good that I kept watching to see what was next. So go to school on the photography and if you get into films because the actors are good to look at, you'll be extra happy.Just don't expect substance or the genuine feel of a Hollywood musical. ",

            "content": "This is the sort of film that makes you detest musicals with how simultaneously twee and self important it is and the fact that the two leads can barely dance and sing. Damien Chazelle directed the very good Whiplash (2014) which explores the pressures of being an artist with dramatic flair but the other two films that he has directed that I have seen have been huge disappointments. This film was frustrating with it's nods to old Hollywood that felt perfunctory instead of feeling like a genuine tribute and it had the sort of half baked qualities that a film like The Artist (2011) possesses. This is not something that anybody should be clamoring to see and it is offensive to the brilliant Moonlight (2016) that this would ever be considered worthy competition to it.\n\nAspiring actress Mia, Emma Stone, tentatively begins a relationship with classical jazz aficionado Sebastian, Ryan Gosling, after they bond at a friend's party. Mia decides to write and perform in a one woman play to jump start her acting career and Sebastian joins a modern jazz band led by Keith, John Legend, who he rebels against as their musical tastes are opposed to his own. Their relationship begins to break down as their ambitions are completely different and their relationship would require a lot of commitment in order to last. They each attain career success but do not end up together and reminisce about the life they could have had when they see each other again years later.\n\nFrom the opening scene of the film in which people in brightly colored clothing jump out of their cars, stuck in a traffic jam, to perform the lackluster song \"Another Day of Sun\" to jerky choreography I knew I hated this film. From this point the film only gets worse as the songs blend together and Stone's monotonous delivery of her lines leaves us rudderless without a charismatic leading lady. I was hoping throughout for some redemptive moment, something that I could pick out and argue in favor of the film for but I was left with nothing. Going into the film I knew that I was particularly tough on musicals, I can only name a few that I actually like, and I detest Stone as an actress but if I can love One from the Heart (1982) and The Favorite (2018) I thought I could tolerate these two elements to find a great film lurking underneath.\n\nThe success of a musical to me rests on the quality of the song and dance numbers and this film lacks any memorable tunes and the choreography is limited as the two lead actors can't dance. Even An American in Paris (1951), which is mostly Leslie Caron being awful and dull conversation, partially rescues itself with a magnificent final scene but the closest this film got to competence was using a cover of A-ha's \"Take on Me\" over the party scene. Gosling simply can't sing as he drawls all of the lines in his big song, \"City of Stars\", and Stone is unconvincing as a dancer or a singer which ruins the film considering the fact that she is lumped with most of the workload. The scene of the two of them dancing on the ceiling of the Griffith Conservatory could have been something beautiful but it is ruined by the scenes before and after it and only really works when divorced from the dislikable characters.\n\nStone's win for Best Actress is blasphemous as she beat out the far superior Isabelle Huppert in Elle (2016) and will now shamefully be placed in the same category as Jessica Lange and Elizabeth Taylor as an actress undeserving of an Academy Award. Gosling doesn't fare much better although he can give great dramatic performances and Legend's role, essentially a cameo, suits him well.\n\nGo watch Gigi (1958) or Kiss Me Kate (1953) if you want an classic MGM musical that actually works but we would all be doing ourselves a favor if this overblown hit was left in the dust. Stone and the poorly written and performed songs tank the film immediately and not one redeemable scene can be found in the film's 128 minute length.",

The movie had no business being nominated for best picture. If you want something to pass the time without making you mad or really bringing out any emotion this is it. Again not a bad movie, just nothing special. ",

With successive jaw dropping projects coming out, his passion grows more intense and the cinema much larger. Coloring the 70mm screen with rich mesmeric visuals, the director, Damien Chazelle is boasting his love with proper understanding of the Hollywood culture that he so blindingly adores. Not an inch goes by in the film that looks pretentious, working over a year on editing along with Tom Cross, Chazelle wishes you to understand the \"if's\" and \"but's\" of this show business in one note. And boy what a note it is. I am sorry but that hooked theme of Justin Hurwitz, whispered in every line of the film always sobers me up.\n\nAll hail the production team for carving out this desert as fresh as it looks, from clothes to designing and from locations to set pieces, the view gets better and better and so does the performance. And daunting as this task may sound, but Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling might be the new Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. But unlike them they aren't quirky but are goofy about the relationship and flirty about their first love. If Stone going over the montages of failed auditions is a threat, then Gosling on piano is her equal competitor.\n\nI have always preferred them alone, one is happy being stubborn and intuitive- something that she later on adapts from him- and other being mature and hard on herself. Together, they would fall apart, they are meant to be, no matter how in sync are they while dancing and how pitch perfect are they while singing, their rhythm is too vacuumed by the outer world to float in one room, maybe they should have just stayed in that cinema hall, but despite of claiming it to be a La La Land, this is the reality, they had to get out.",

First of all the movie has basically two characters, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's characters are the central focus and it works. They both get nearly equal screen time in order to show off their amazing acting. Not only do they show off their acting, but also dancing and singing, all of which is beautifully sung and choreographed. (This especially applies to Ryan who learned to play piano beautifully just for this movie.) The plot is sweet, romantic, and I always love a tragedy. My favorite aspect of the film are the visuals and the pacing. The movie focuses a lot on color and uses that to paint a fantastical image of Hollywood without being to direct. It helps the plot and determines the mood. The pacing is also perfect; the use of seasons to separate periods of Seb and Mia's relationship works and is timed like they could be chapters in a book. It has a plot that could have been a book integrated with cinematography and musical aspects that I have never seen in a film together.",

This movie is everything.\n\nIt is beautiful, happy, magical, romantic and I could go on for a little while longer but I won't. I wasn't expecting it to be this musical-y, but I mean, I love musicals so I'm not complaining. I think this is a great \"musical\" because there isn't non stop singing, so people who don't like musicals might like this one because it's more \"subtle\". I can only imagine how much practice went into all those dance routines and don't get me started on the impressive piano skills Ryan Gosling showed us.\n\nSomething that really impressed me as well was the way they filmed everything. It's a very creative and different way, which I really enjoyed and think makes this movie a great inspiration for those who love film and camerawork themselves. The build up and flashbacks and stuff were really cool as well. Yea I really enjoyed that. Also, the storyline, which does so much for a movie, was so great.\n\nThis is normally the part were I talk about the actors, but seeing that there were mainly only two actors and they were both amazing (I do think tho, that Ryan Gosling his character wasn't a very challenging one for him because we have seen him in roles like these before. Mixing it up with all the dancing, singing en piano playing though, you got something quite different and I loved it), I'm going to skip this part and say that you should watch this movie, do nothing more, just watch it, enjoyed it and love it.",

            "content": "\"This is the dream! It's conflict and it's compromise, and it's very, very exciting!\"\n\nWhere to start? I'll be honest, based on the trailers that I saw I wasn't very excited to see this; I thought that it would just be average or slightly above and incredibly artsy either way. Let me say, I love being proved wrong when it comes to a film being better than I thought it would be, and I was proven very wrong in this case.\n\nIn my opinion, this is what film making is about. Director Damien Chazelle came out of the gates swinging in 2014 with Whiplash (probably one of my top ten films of all time). He hits the ball out of the park this time by telling the story of Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a jazz pianist and Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress who bump into one another on more than a few occasions resulting in a roller coaster of emotions.\n\nI know that musicals (especially modern day ones) are often looked upon in a certain light by most. Sure there is singing and even several incredible dance numbers in La La Land, yet beyond all of that it has so much more to offer. The story isn't the best ever told but the way it is captured both visually and through the song and dance is almost beyond words. Both Gosling and Stone have achieved what I'd consider their best performances in their careers to this point.\n\nPlease don't go into this expecting Singin' in the Rain, The Sound of Music or even Grease. This film transcends the traditional role of a musical to offer something that I've not seen before. Damien Chazelle's idea was to \"to take the old musical but ground it in real life where things don't always exactly work out.\" He more than succeeded in his vision by crafting a great movie into a fantastic musical. Too often, musicals have strained performances and misplaced song and dance numbers. La La Land has masterful performances with song and dance seamlessly incorporated to enhance the story even further.\n\nMost musicals deliver several great songs; however, this film with John Legend as a producer, delivers incredible songs that have already won awards. \"City of Stars,\" sung by Gosling himself, was a bright point in a film that already had so many. Honestly, before watching this I had no clue that Gosling or Stone could sing. While neither are likely to go on to have exciting musical careers, they both stretched their talents and sung to the level of their characters with perfection.\n\nOne of the few things that I take for granted in film are the captivating visuals. I've seen so many major blockbuster sci-fi adventures that I rarely stop to appreciate the subtlety that a true artist can bring to the screen. Everything from matte paintings, lighting, and cinematography play a role in giving a film a look and feel that take you to another world. The visuals in La La Land are truly a work of art, the colors jump off the screen, and thanks to the lighting throughout, your eyes are directed exactly where they're meant to be. On top of Damien's incredible directorial style, he also wrote both Whiplash and La La Land. Chazelle is a true artist that I'm looking forward to seeing more and more from in the coming years.\n\nWhen I started these reviews, I wanted to make sure I didn't throw around the five star rating lightly. Even Star Wars (which I happen to be a huge fan of) only got 4 1/2. I've given some older films five stars, but this is going to be my exception to the norm. A film like this doesn't come along often and I want it to be known and be seen.",

(Salinger 139), Sally's an old acquaintance of mine who is not too smart but pretends to be, it makes me goddamn sick sometimes. Anyhow, this movie was way too phony. The guy on the piano was way too serious about himself and made me sick, the thought that the director believed that people actually act like that made me so depressed about society that I just wanted to run away to a cabin somewhere away from everything. But the girl, Emma Stone, she was a knockout and a pretty swell actor to boot. She was the only reason the picture was tolerable, and she was the only good dancer out of all those phonies on screen. She reminded me of old Jane Gallagher, a swell girl that you actually wanted to spend time with. But the rest of those phonies, they made me goddamn sick, none of them could dance and thy were just trying too hard. I guess some of them were ok actors but they were too good if you know what I mean. They just didn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t seem real and were too phony to be real people.

            "content": "- Take us away to La La Land. -\n\nWe all know 2016 has been a mare of a year. It feels like with every step forward, we take three steps back. La La Land is like a hug to make us feel a little better, despite all the shit that's gone down.\n\nIn the 1930s, when much of the world suffered from the Great Depression, people turned to the cinemas to enter another dreamscape. In the dim light of the cinema, nestled into their chairs, audiences entered a trance where - for just a little while - all that mattered was Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. Just in time to shake off our 2016 worries, Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) gives us La La Land.\n\nEmma Stone (The Help, Easy A) stars as Mia, a modern day Kathy Selden who jumps from audition to audition trying to break into the Hollywood scene. The story revolves around Mia's romance with Sebastian, who is played by Ryan Gosling (The Notebook; Crazy, Stupid, Love). With eye candy and this good, it's no surprise that La La Land is unabashedly a classic musical.\n\nThe story opens with Mia, it follows Mia's gaze. It's Mia's fantasies we explore all the way through an elaborate finale. There is no question that the musical is a tale of a woman's success - her dreams, her work, her family, and all the messy ways those things can work together. It's a pleasure to watch the chemistry between Stone and Gosling, but in the end, it's not a Gosling film.\n\nAs we settle into the story, we are treated to a scene where the romantic tension between Mia and Sebastian is almost palpable. I was transported to my high-school crushes, to first kisses, and to the absolute buzz of young love. The film triggers an acute and mind-bending sense of nostalgia. Somewhere between the mid-century color schemes and the melancholy piano, the audience starts to yearn for a time when we might have felt good.\n\nAs a side note, despite all of the nostalgic hyperdrive choreographic sequences, there are at least two mannequin-style choreographed scenes (without the annoying song).  I actually have a crazy conspiracy theory that this year's Mannequin Challenge has been a viral marketing campaign for the film.\n\nAs you can see, I'm a cynic at heart. The problems with La La Land mirror the problems with the musical genre as a whole. It's heteronormative, it's privileged, and it's an absolute capitalist fan club. Although the film gives us a welcome release from the malaise of the political mess we are in, it still preaches the morals of hard work and dreamers and success.\n\nIt's a real shame - because straight, white, middle-class \"dreamers\" were not the ones to suffer the most from this year's tragedies. For me, the film sits at a solid 3.5 stars because it gives in to a lot of the old musical trappings. It loses points for lack of diverse representation and a somewhat lackluster outcome for the protagonist.\n\nDespite this, La La Land is the Christmas sweater you shun in front of your friends but slip into when no one's watching. It's a comfort and a guilty pleasure. It's a spectacle, and an escape - exactly what I desperately craved.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://narrativemuse.co/movies/la-la-land, and was written by Sarah Krieg.

At the end of the film you will surely understand what the two protagonists choose and why they chose it, again shown in a beautiful way. It takes influence from movies like \"Singing in the Rain\" and demonstrates some iconic scenes in a new modern way that makes you feel nostalgic about the classic one. It is so perfectly crafted, but what makes this movie unique from any other romantic movies is its ending. That ending. Not only does it deliver some extremely emotional scenes but it changes the whole idea you had for the film. \nAlso, in a musical the music needs to be stunning for it to be successful. For the first time in a movie, I have cried so loudly when hearing a song. This soundtrack gives you the feels. It is a masterpiece from song one until the very last song. \nThe film is ultimately everything it had the potential to be - an unashamedly romantic musical, infused not only with great song and dance numbers but with intense emotion and charisma from Gosling/Stone, wonderful visuals and a unique pacing and tension from Chazelle. Oh, and it's hilarious throughout too. A genuine achievement - must be one of the best films I've seen in a long while.\nCheers to the dreamers, the men and women behind the making of this musical classic masterpiece.",

            "content": "Music and Love; Clich\u00e9? Yes, But They Are Going to Engross Your Attention\n               In early 20 century, people thought jazz is the devil's music. Jazz is attractive, powerful and beautiful, which is going to grab your heart from the beginning and the end, so is La La Land. La La Land, released in 2016, directed by Damien Chazelle, is a beautiful love story with fantastic music and dancing, as known as a musical movie. If you are looking for a movie that is going to make you captivated, La La Land is the best movie for you.\n\n               Damien Chazelle is a famous director for music related movie. Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench, Grand Piano and Whiplash are his previous work before La La Land. Because Whiplash got numerous awards from Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role to Best Achievement in Film Editing, I thought La La Land will follow the same structure of story, such as talent, practice, passion, etc. However, La La Land is totally different style of a movie. Compared to previous movies, La La Land more focuses on plot. I want to say that Damien Chazelle's music related movies are the best no matter what structure he uses.\n\nLa La Land has everything that a successful movie requires, good story and acting. Mia and Sebastian had dreams, a jazz musician and an actor. They supported each other's dream. Love and dream, aren't they clich\u00e9? But clich\u00e9 works perfect with perfect music.\n\nAt a scene that Mia and Sebastian meet again at Seb's, a jazz bar Sebastian runs, Sebastian plays a song named epilogue and imagines the future, what if we were still together. They look each other before Mia leaves Seb's, and this scene has the best acting in this movie. Sebastian slowly smiles and Mia responds to it with smile, too. Ryan Gosling's gentle and subtle smile was so perfect that my heart started crying. They showed that they respect and support each other's present, which was used be just a dream, through their smiles. Isn't this beautiful? Amazing acting astonished me, but music in the movie also surprised me and let me enjoy whole movie.\n\n               La La Land has plot like a music. It starts with very strong, bright and impressive songs Another Day of Sun and Someone in the Crowd like an addictive intro of pop music. Dancing and colorful clothes of the actors do not allow you to be distracted. However, since Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is getting known each other better after the party, the movie tells people that the main story starts now. Songs, from A Lovely Night to Summer Montage, kept me focusing on the movie. Tap dancing by two main characters at A Lovely Night scene was also great as the song. The movie does not stop at a happy love story. City of Stars, Set A Fire, Engagement Party and Audition (The Fool Who Dream) show the main point of the movie, contradiction between dream and reality, Mia and Sebastian. Climax and resolution of the story is the future that Sebastian draws via Epilogue, the future if Mia and Sebastian would not break up. This well-made songs and plot are one of the best part of the movie.\n\n               If you want to watch a happy-ending movie, La La Land may not a movie you are looking for. But, if you are looking for well-made musical music, La La Land will give you unforgettable experience. A well written story directed by a music movie expert, great acting by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, fantastic songs from singing to background, and even lovely and romantic California where the movie is taken are not going to let you down.",

Damien Chazelle has given us a perfect blend of songs, colour, conflict and drama however Hurwitz and Moore are the real underlying heroes with a score that you listen to with both your ears and your hips. The film brilliantly captures the harsh realities of chasing your dreams and how destructive they can be for relationships. From its first upbeat jam on the freeway to the very final musical epilogue at the end, La La Land will leave you on a high note you never even knew you could reach.",

She never gets parts, not because she sucks, but she is starting to give up on her ambitions. Then there's another huge name, Ryan Gosling is Sebastian. A pianist that takes rather crappy music jobs. He has plenty of dreams that involve real jazz, something that's dying if you ask him. They share a story. It starts of as separate parts, but they get involved in each others lifes very smoothly. The film for me is both simple and straight forward, throw in some songs and some moves and you got yourself a musical. Not the most typical musical, but there are at least six or seven scenes here done with songs.\n\nI liked it, even if it's not a complete treat. It's not the most exciting, it's easy and not that original. It looks OK but nothing more. I understand the big hype, it's something for the average music fan and film fan.

After eons, we finally get to watch a perfect potboiler; a cracker of a love story; simply out of the world music; brilliant casting and finally a chance to listen to A-ha's Take on Me on screen. What more can we ask for?\n\nAs it turns out, we sure can ask for more. For instance, we can ask for the leading pair to the set the screen ablaze and they do better. Apart from setting our screen ablaze, they end up burning the reel of the movie they are watching. When their hands caress each other; the fingers play hide and seek and finally end up entwined, it is probably Fahrenheit 451. I can't say for sure for I was running for the door?-?I had to find a passage back to the place I was before.\n\n\"Relax\" said the girl with the cutest eyes I have ever seen on screen, perhaps off screen too, \"You can check out anytime you want. But you can never leave!\" So true, it's been an hour and thirty miles from where the show ended and I still look to my left and find the pair dancing as if there is no tomorrow amidst applause by the mighty skyline of Los Angeles.\n\nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone set the screen on fire. Their chemistry is so fundamental and native that you are convinced they are made and mad for each other. Fortunately, the director ensures they stop at quick kisses, for who knows how many fire tenders would have to be called had they gone a little beyond kissing!\n\nIt is what we call here a mass masala. It has all the ingredients in the right proportions served exactly at the right moment?-?not a second earlier and not a second later. It has drama, humour, emotion, heartbreak, you name it?-?it has it. And there's a method in this madness, a beautiful form that keeps all these elements in check allowing none to engulf the others.\n\nA perfect musical in the more than able hands of the two insanely talented young actors Gosling and Stone. There are a number of Birdmanish sequences in the movie where you wonder if the director got carried away in the sparkling romance brewing in front of him and forgot to say \"cut\" and the actors happily continued enjoying each other's presence. Pulling off such lengthy sequences is not a mean feat, mind you?-?especially when there is no CGI to bail you out.\n\nThe last fifteen minutes of the movie take it the next level completely. Not that the movie needed to be taken there. It was perfectly fine at the level it was playing. Still the climax, so brilliantly conceptualized and flawlessly executed?-?make it sort of a classic of classics. It is pure poetry. It has to be seen to be believed. No one can review this piece. It is God. You just sit there and submit yourself to it.\n\nIf you haven't watched it yet, you are probably incredibly fortunate. For, beware?-?Once you see it, there's no going back.

            "content": "Singing and dancing its way into the hearts, minds, and ears of even those who think that Chicago was a complete waste of time, elegant, enchanting, edgy and elegiac tune-up La La Land often looks like an homage to Golden Age H'Wood but sports enough lovestruck spark and - alternately - jaded spunk to qualify it as a true modern-day genre original. \n\nIn this PG-13-rated musical, a pianist (Ryan Gosling) and an actress (Emma Stone) fall in love while attempting to reconcile their aspirations for the future amid navigating their divergent careers in Los Angeles. Don't call it a throwback. Indeed, La La Land lovingly tips its hat to such entertainment industry-set musicals as Singin' in the Rain and New York, New York but also charts a millennial-appropriate melancholic course all its own. While some great musicals like All that Jazz get downright bleak, La La Land softshoes into the dark without every fully losing its color and buoyancy. Take for instance a date night rendezvous shot in the Griffith Observatory, which literally sees the leads taking flight and dancing among the stars. This could very easily have gotten so on-the-nose schmaltzy that the scene required an animated Disney sidekick. Instead, the entire song-and-dance - we're taking the film as a whole - knowingly keeps it from tripping over its own feet into a brink called cornball. It knows what it is. It's a dessert and a floor wax...er, rather, it's nostalgic, romantic, and also terminally cynical all at once while dancing backward in high heels. If that doesn't speak to many of today's workaday Americans, then the musical is not only merely dead, it's really most sincerely dead.  \n\nUltimately, La La Land is a hat-trick...albeit a very accomplished hat-trick. To remain vital in that gnat's-attention-span known as modern pop culture, a musical must implant one key feature into the brain of filmgoers: a hummable tune. Just as a western must present at least one key scene set in or that strongly brings to mind the untamed mythic expanse known as the American West, a musical has to boast at least one notable song. La La Land accomplishes this. Oh, \"City of Stars\" won't ultimately achieve the classic status of, say, \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" from The Wizard of Oz, but definitely qualifies as toe-tapping and memorable. \"Another Day of Sun\" proves less of an earworm but backs the film's showstopper moment--a one-take, traffic-snarled freeway song-and-dance number. That this showstopper kicks off the film and a blue note ends it while still making the audience beam from ear to ear speaks to the brilliance of director Damian Chazelle. Neither a jukebox musical nor a Broadway adaptation, his La La Land is a rare beast thought extinct. Building upon his short musical Guy And Madeline On A Park Bench (perhaps a bit too much as the film's only failing is that it runs too long) with a cornucopia and cacophony perfectly suited for the here and now, his musical is original in the best sense. In fact, his hat-trick greatly one-ups 2011 Best Picture Oscar winner The Artist, which was a silent film homage accomplished through shear imitation. La La Land harks back without becoming its forebears--a love letter and a Dear John letter in one fell swoop. Chazelle shares this dignity not just with the genius-level choreographers and songwriters, but mostly with Gosling and Stone who pull all off the whole act with a ridiculous amount of grace and conviction. An impeccable latter-day Vaudeville team, their singing and dancing aren't perfect but you wouldn't want them polished to that vaunted degree. They're relatable...well, at least as relatable as people who break into song on a moment's notice. Working beautifully together, step for gorgeous step and note for lovely note, they provide the heart and soul to a film whose target demo are people with hearts and souls. \n\nTo Sum It All Up: City of Starstruck",

But soon within minutes becomes the crowd pleasing, tone setting opening number of musical glee. \n\n\nSelf aware and contemporary the camera glides through the scene in seemingly well choreographed Steadicam shot.\n\n\n Here we meet Emma Stone's struggling actress, to Ryan Gosling's struggling Musician both living in LA but both not living the dream - as one would have hoped. Eventually after the standard Rom/Com beats are walked through - Love is to blossom - but ironically only when it does there seems to be somewhat weakness in the story.\n\n\n\nSpoiler Alert\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tension in the story erupts from the unemployed Gosling taking advice from Stone and getting a \"real\" job. Here his first \"real\" job happens to be a lead member of a overnight successful band and he travels the country making tons of money using his natural musical talents - sure beats working 50hrs a week at McDonald's.\n\n\nOn the flip side of this seemingly awful \"Hell\", Stone quits her day job of serving coffee on the Warner Brothers lot to become a full time unemployed play wright - clearly not taking her own advice. \n\n\n\nAnd when that \"horrible\" bread winning boyfriend then takes time out of his hectic schedule to travel back across the country just to surprise his Girlfriend and cook her dinner, how fitting they have their first big row.\n\n\nHe is pulled to task on not playing the type of music he loves, instead he advised he should quit and to continue on his ambition of starting his own jazz club with no money and no savings.  At this point it looks like Stone's Character is truly living in \"LA LA Land\" indeed. \n\n\n Later the tables are turned and she becomes a successful actor with Gosling supporting her totally making the sacrificing pledge that they should split so she could concentrate totally on her opportunity. A supportive partner indeed with Stone replying she will always love him. Cut to five years later when she's a Hollywood superstar, married someone to else and had their baby - Romeo and Juliet indeed this is not. \n\n\nThe ending seems rushed and somewhat deluded in order to  comply with a clever idea of a third dream but in orchestrating in this manner to me doesn't ring true to character of Stone or what we've just spent two hours setting up.\n\n\nBut hey this is a musical! Sure it's running time is a little to generous for a somewhat uncomplicated story but this film is made form start to finish with bucket loads of passion from every department. \n\n\n The Director takes this genre and wears his heart in his sleeve sucking in some beautiful natural lighting, sunsets and set pieces celebrating L.A natural charm. \n\n\nTalking of charm the lead actors have plenty - oozing it from the screen and thoroughly enjoying any opportunity to sing and dance the genre to pride. \nThis film is escapism and as long as you take yourself to \"La La Land\" in the first place, you will surely have a nice enjoyable time in this nostalgic wink to classic Hollywood and contemporary L.A.",

I literally cannot remember a single one as the Jazz genre this promoted just didn't promote that uplifting feel good vibe. The story was understandable but weak, following the lives of two aspiring talents, one in music, and one in film. Both keen to follow their hearts to get to where they dream of being, regardless of the knock backs they receive along the way. Frankly i was bored and even the simple story began to lose me towards the end, as we witnessed confusing scenes of what could have been as well as what actually occurred. This is not what I would have expected from a highly acclaimed musical, and certainly not what I would have wanted. I'm pleased it pleased so many other audiences out there but I can assure you its success will never cease to astound me.",

Every emotion that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone convey with their eyes, Damien Chazelle with his wonderful vision of this story, Justin Hurwitz with every single note of his catchy and touching songs. It's one of those films which might not necessarily have one of the most complicated plots, but it takes you on an emotional journey which will make you both laugh and cry.

Unfortunately, it was a huge let down and certainly not worth the Oscar hype and adoration from critics.\n\nFrom the very first number, it's clear that the choreography is subpar. I expected more from professional dancers, and the numbers with Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are even more disappointing. \"La La Land\" is clearly trying to recapture some of the magic from old Hollywood, but if you were to compare some of the incredible tap numbers of the past to the little number Stone and Gosling did while overlooking L.A., it simply falls flat.\n\nThe singing was also not quite up to snuff, ranging from \"not good\" to \"okay\". The songs were, regrettably, very forgettable.\n\nEmma Stone is a darling, and her quirkiness is always much appreciated. Ryan Gosling's character was also had his quirks, but he came of as weird and not charming. Stone also out-acted Gosling. Watch the emotional range on her face during the dinner fight argument and compare it to Gosling. \n\nOn top of the musical aspect of the film being a disappointment, it's quite boring. Scenes dragged on, and some of the dialogue was compiled of ramblings. There's a rush of excitement at the end in a musical montage of \"what ifs\", but it's far too late by then.",

The run time is approx 2 hours but flies by with brilliant pacing. The script is deep and immersed with many clever jokes that I didn't expect. My biggest concern going into it was that because it was a musical the script would get undermined. The relationship between Gosling and Stone was the best part of the film. During the epilogue many people in the theatre gasped when they seen what there relationship was, this quantified the deep connection with the audience and character.  La La Land's best decision was to not fall into the cliche of a classic Hollywood love story. The music as expected is great, and not over done it has a good balance of people randomly breaking out in song and normal dialogue. My biggest flaw was the John legend character.

The run time is approx 2 hours but flies by with brilliant pacing. The script is deep and immersed with many clever jokes that I didn't expect. My biggest concern going into it was that because it was a musical the script would get undermined. The relationship between Gosling and Stone was the best part of the film. During the epilogue many people in the theatre gasped when they seen what there relationship was, this quantified the deep connection with the audience and character.  La La Land's best decision was to not fall into the cliche of a classic Hollywood love story. The music as expected is great, and not over done it has a good balance of people randomly breaking out in song and normal dialogue. My biggest flaw was the John legend character. He was just kinda there and didn't really bring anything to the table. I actually kinda forgot that he was in the film after I watched it.

I could barely see anything because my eyes were filled with tears, but yes. The Griffith Observatory fantasy scene? Fantastic! The performances, the score, the montages, the pure fun, and showing a realistic love story (I haven't cried in any other movie quite like I did during this movie) made La La Land so memorable and one of my favorite movies.",

            "content": "Definitely evocative of the classic musicals of the 1950s (think Vincente Minnelli) - with a bittersweet flavour that wasn't really present in the swinging comic 1930s (think Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers), Damien Chazelle's third feature knows its history but doesn't quite transcend it.  Instead, Chazelle plays within the rules of the genre (in which characters can break into song and dance at any given moment) and this has led to some accusations of sexism because the relationship between Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) does evoke 1950s traditional gender roles (and expectations) despite the fact that the leads' efforts toward developing careers in the entertainment industry (jazz pianist and actor, respectively) are given relatively equal attention.  Although the film opens audaciously with a big number on a highway overpass with a large cast of dancers and then quickly shows us a color-coded sequence featuring Emma Stone and her roommates, things then calm down a bit as Stone and Gosling begin their romance.  That's not to say that Chazelle doesn't have a great emotional touch or that his script doesn't continually hit the right buttons for an homage of this sort, it just doesn't stay at that high level of surprise/stunningness (nor should it, if the movie is to follow screenwriting 101 norms, which it does).  Gosling is fine, rather subdued and perhaps not much of a singer/dancer (though he taught himself piano for the role) but Stone is very charismatic (if somewhat unusual looking with such large eyes) and together they manage to make their relationship seem real enough with a trajectory that is more-or-less believable.  I say \"more-or-less\" because in a musical such as this, realism isn't really necessary, nor even expected; Chazelle gives into the fantasy elements of his script but has the wisdom to underscore the implausibility with the same sort of sadness that you find in Demy's Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964).  Again, the thrills found here are not a result of anything new but just a fine example of a master craftsman using the best materials to recreate something that was well-loved from the past (albeit with a new script, songs, and players).",

            "content": "LaLa Land-Dream Chasing is Not For the Weak\n\nBecause Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are quite the duo, they are a perfect choice for the two leading co-stars in Damien Chazelle's film La La Land. This wonderfully clever film plays on their talents and intertwines the stories of two very determined dreamers showing the true dilemma that dream-chasing can bring.\n\nConnected by more than just mediocre musical talent, the two stars dance, sing and wittily bounce off each other in a magical way, showing the joys and heart aches of two dreamers working oh-so hard to pursue their own ambitions while encouraging the other to do the same. Gosling plays Sebastian, an aspiring piano player who wishes to one day own a Jazz Club. He crosses paths with Stone's character Mia, an ambitious actress who despite her best efforts, just can't seem to land a role and is stuck being a barista at a coffee shop. The two, at first, don't seem to get along, displayed in a couple different scenes where their interactions are not so pleasant. When they finally come face-to-face enough to actually talk to one another, they flirtatiously banter and sing a very provoking duet while dancing, before there are any noticeable feelings between the two. Soon after getting more acquainted with each other, Mia and Sebastian are drawn together by their similar drive for their dreams. Their very distinctive dreams. The couple's wonderful chemistry can't seem to keep them together as they are both trying to follow their dreams, realizing that as they are both working to fulfill their individual dreams, they are inevitably getting torn apart. The ending scene shows the two characters with their very separate lives in their very separate dreams, fulfilled and satisfied.\n\nI think that one of the things that drives home the predicament between love and ambition is the sheer chemistry between the main characters. We've seen Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling previously work marvelously together in Crazy, Stupid, Love and know that they are two very lovable actors. I would say they are even more lovable when they're in love with each other. The film does a wonderful way of playing off of each actor's strengths, with Gosling's doting charm and Stones adorable sense of humor, giving the on-screen pair a perfect, not over-bearing, amount of spark. That amazing amount of chemistry between the two is what makes the ending of the movie especially hard for me. I dare anyone to say \"I hope that those two(might I add, perfect people) don't end up with each other at the end of this all!\" So, it kills me that they don't actually end up with one another. Who could see that coming? I can't say that I wouldn't have rather have had the two together, with each other, happy at the end. What makes the ending even more difficult is that a heart-wrenching scene plays the \"what could have been\" between the couple showing how happy their life together could have been. Regardless, it is clear to see why they couldn't be together. There was not a way for them to both to fulfill their separate dreams without sacrificing their relationship. But who cares? Mia and Sebastian are soulmates and as we see from that scene showing their alternate lives, the couple could have been so happy in their life together! Not to say that they are not happy in their dream lives-the last scene shows that they most definitely are, but it certainly makes me happier having them together. It goes to show that sacrifices have to be made in life to fulfill ones dream's, however painful the sacrifice may be. It also shows that happiness and satisfaction can be found in many different paths of life. \n\nThat central idea of chasing after dreams and the things that need to be given up in order to do so, is so original and I love that! This film does a splendid job at really showing both the joys and pains of dream chasing. The whole movie I was wondering, which character, if either, would be able to attain their ambitions and what they would need to forgo in order to remain together. You see as the classic romantic storyline goes, things are always sacrificed for love, not the other way around. In some cases, the dream and the love are found together. One example of this is found in one of Stone's previous films-The Amazing Spider-Man, where Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) gets to live out his life as a superhero and gets the girl(Stone), showing both love and ambition being obtained. This film, however, chooses to sacrifice the unspeakable: love. The fact that love is given up in the end is a major plot twist and makes this film very distinct. Yeah, maybe I knew that Sebastian and Mia would fall in love, but I never would have guessed how their lives would play out to be so detached. Although notably appreciative for the life together they forsook, in the end, both characters were content in living the life they had worked so diligently for and I can't be upset about that.\n\nAll in all, I think that La La Land relays a wonderful message, in a clever way, with amazing actors. We truly get a unique take on the risk of pursuing dreams. Everything from Stone's and Gosling's natural chemistry, to their drive for their ambitions, to them taking a stab at a musical with less-than perfect singing and dancing endeared me to them and their situations and made me love this movie. I loved it so much that I walked out of the movie, not only contemplating what had just happened, but feeling surprisingly happy about it because clearly, the ending was not one that I would have ever would have wanted. If that isn't impressive, then I don't know what is.",

Mia, a typical aspiring young actor who works in a coffee shop, and Sebastian, a down on his luck jazz pianist, are struggling to get by in a competitive modern LA and are drawn together by their desire to follow their dreams. \nBoth Emma Stone, as Mia, and Ryan Gosling, as Sebastian, carry this film very well but Emma Stone in particular is very magnetic and gives a powerful performance as her character struggles to achieve her goals and choose between love and her dreams. Sebastian on the other hand is far less interesting and could have done with more character development but Stone and Gosling have such good chemistry together that their romance is very believable. Both actors also have quite nice singing voices but the songs are largely forgettable save for one or two of the bigger numbers. \nThe plot is fairly predictable and the film starts to drag a bit towards the end but it's still enjoyable to watch and I particularly liked the direction they went with the ending.The tap dancing number is also a nice homage to musicals like singing in the rain and iconic performances by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers but Stone and Gosling can't hold a candle to that level of skill at tap dancing.\nThe cinematography is good and very nostalgic of old Hollywood and uses light and colour well to accentuate the mood of different scenes and moments. There are also many long tracking shots, without cuts, of musical numbers and dances that are very well choreographed, performed and flow seamlessly. However some of the camera work is a little manic and the amount of spinning in some scenes is a bit nauseating and overdone. \nOverall, although it's a shame the songs aren't catchier, it's an enjoyable musical and a love letter to LA that I think most people will enjoy.",

            "content": "I've never been a fan of the musical or romantic genre in general, but with it's energetic tone, powerful performances, relative themes and Damien Chazelle's assured direction, La La Land captured my attention in a way few films of this caliber ever could. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are perfect in the lead roles and its all mostly down to their performances, injecting plenty of character and personality into their roles along with their natural chemistry. Both of their characters also benefit from the amount of depth that the well written script demands of them, making their characters well rounded and intensely relatable. Emma Stone, in particular is very captivating, her character's turmoils are conveyed through Stone's layered performance. It's down to them that throughout the film you care so much for the two. La La Land tells a heartwarming tale of love, sacrifice and our fantasies, and balances its dramatic elements perfectly against the musical and romantic tone it also has. It tells the timeless story of a pair who must decide either to advance on their relationship at the cost of their dreams or follow their path, and while the film is rightfully full of energy and crowd pleasing, it doesn't shy away from the cruelty underneath either. During the middle act, the film hits a bit of a sludge, not that its too bad, but the transition is very noticeable after the onslaught of music that came before, before picking back up for the grand finale. All capped off with an all too true ending that is as memorable as they come. Damien Chazelle once again delivers, after his film Whiplash, with a timeless, old school feel that proves that these kinds of films still work today, in his craft, blending together themes of romance, drama and plenty of assured heart while exploring the age-old conflict of ambition vs love with a rare sense of pursuance relative to most other films like this. The film is filled with plenty of memorable music scores, from the energetic open in sequence to the more slow-paced, and thoughtful \"City of Stars\" although it does taper off a not during its middle act in order to develop it's characters. The camera editing between these sequences is sharp and gives the film a brisk feel as they alternate between different segments in a seamless fashion. Above all else, the film is undeniably gorgeous to look at, the cinematography paints the film in beautiful shades of blue, red, and the occasional green that makes it that much harder to look at. For a musical film, and much less, a romantic one, La La Land quickly embraces my attention like none before. -",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT - this review contains several spoilers, so, if you haven't seen this movie yet, don't read this.\nWhen I was told for the very first time \"Man, you gotta go and watch \"La La Land\", you don't know what are you missing!\", I thought \"Jeez, it must be a very masterpiece, I cannot miss it!\". I have to say, that the musical movies aren't exactly my favourite ones, since I hate when they sing during a movie - I see it like \"Hey, look at me, I can sing and I'm making you losing useful time for the plot\", but I however decided to watch it, just because I was told it was unlosable. Actually, this is precisely the kind of movie you can't miss, because, well or badly, it will make people talk about itself for ages. So, I've been to the cinema for it, and I can eventually say that I find this movie terribly awful. I've never felt my money and time more wasted than having watched this movie in a cinema. \nWhat I don't appreciate in this movie is not the technical part. The director's, director of photography's, sound technicians', scene makers' and other workers' job is very fine. The problems stay in the rest: the story, the sense of some scenes, the music... I was covered by expectations, this movie should have given me an experience beyond good and bad, making me cry... I've cried two times in 12 years, due to not-physical-pain-related motivations, so, as you can imagine, it's very difficult to make me show my emotions in a very clear way. However, this movie, according to all the expectation I was given, should have provoked this kind of reaction in me. But, instead, NO, t didn't! I was very annoyed by the presumption of this movie, which tries to destroy the world with its exceptionally bright colours and musics, trying to be original at every cost; according to me, instead, it miserably fails. There are especially three points that make me quite upset.\nFirst of all, the love story. It's just the usual, normal, obvious love story with the cool guy and the cool girl (I don't know how \"cool\" this girl is, actually... Emma Stone is a very nice girl, but her face seems to make her cry every time she is focused with the camera, but, however, let's go on), they meet up, but eventually they break up because he doesn't care for her, her projects sink, he lets his dream go just for money... in the end she's happy with someone else, and they meet up, quite embarrassed, again and they just say \"We'll love each other forever\" (big lie, since you have married another guy, and you don't seem unhappy together with him, but maybe I can't just read the fadings in uman feelings...). Maybe I don't believe in love, but it can't be possible that you fall in love for someone just listening him playing. I've tried this on myself, and no. IT - DOESN'T - WORK - THIS - WAY. Gotcha? Ok, let's go on.\nSecondly, the music: a musical with bad music is died at its very beginning. Songs are bright, coloured, but tremendously common. Where are the good old times of Ennio Morricone, and similars? If I think of the fact that the Academy Award for the best song was given to \"City of stars\", which is just a G-7 chord, repeated for about 4 minutes, my blood boils... is everything really here? You seriously gave the most important award for a cinema song to this? It's another sympthom of the fact that musical feeling of the audience dropped like a waterfall... Seriously, it's ununderstandable.\nLast, but not least, the ending scene. I've never felt this useless watching a movie scene. It's as like as they told you \"Oh, wow, you reached this point, and the movie could end here... but I'd like to show you what could have happened. [scene] Hey, you liked it? Me too, but unfortunately, this hasn't happened, your protagonists will live happy forever with their lives, and I needed to make the movie longer, because the productor wouldn't give me enough money to make this movie be called a 'kolossal', you know...\". The final scene is precisely the representation of what happened during the Academy Awards Ceremony: \"Hey, your movie could have been the best, but, unfortunately, there is another one which we must give this little statue to, for a mere practical/political reason\". \nSynthetizing my thought in few words: this movie is a poo sign in cinema's underpants. I had really liked to appreciate it, but unfortunately, I couldn't do it anyway, nothing has been able to convince me that this movie is nothing but a terribly boring sequence of songs and love moments, and some scenes somewhere are quite forced - it's very good for the scene that Mia has a pair of man ball shoes in her pocket, just because Sebastian needed them and the plot requested it... very normal, I must say... -. The only thing I did appreciate was the speech about jazz music pronounced by Sebastian at a certain point, but stop. Everything else, in the not-technical field, doesn't work. Bad experience, mainly due to the huge expectations I had, totally unfulfilled, which makes my judgement much more worse. This is just a normal movie, but it's been unexplainably worshipped by the criticians and the audience. If you can, avoid this.",

Even that movie was as surprising as La La Land. If you don't like Jazz and broadway stuff then you can forget it and move on. But if you like quirky yet face the music stuff like La La Land then stay and enjoy the story because Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone did an outstanding performance. The one intense song called \"Someone in the Crowd\" is still playing in my head as I type this and it gives me an inspiring feel. Makes me want to chase my dreams, if you will. The story is so typical but it's so good because it's a good reminder that even if you can't, you can and just do it.

Obviously it has gotten all the praise it got for a reason - and I don't disagree with all the reviews, this movie has a lot to offer for all types of people. There is obviously the romance between Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone), and the chemistry between the two was extremely strong throughout the movie, so much so actually that it legitimately tore me to shreds by the end of the movie, and in no way whatsoever am I that emotional of a person, especially with movies. But this one was something different, by the end, I felt for both of the characters, and the ending was done in a way that I'm not afraid to say brought me to actual tears. The musical part of this movie was also a huge plus, both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have pleasant vocals, and the jazz themed music was also really well done. However, although there has been an insane amount of praise for this movie, there is a specific target audience, and I don't really think I fit into that target category. I did say that this movie is good no matter who you are, but if you're someone who isn't really into romantic musicals, then the first half of this movie might seem a little slow, which was a little bit the case for me. By the end however, it really picked up, and like I said, sent me through a whirlwind of emotions, which again is pretty uncommon for me. In the end, \"La La Land\" deserves most of the praise that it gets, and if you are interested in the premise of this movie, then you will definitely enjoy it, however if it doesn't interest you and you just want to check it out because of the reviews, don't get your hopes up too high.

The fact that a musical that specifically hails the cinematography styles of old film while retaining the element of modernity to remain relevant... truly a breathtaking film.\nFirst, let me give kudos to Stone and Gosling for wonderful performances (to include the song and dance.) While not as poised as professional Broadway stars may be, the authenticity is there and gives it the \"special something\" it needs. I am particularly fond of all the song and dance sequences, especially the epilogue, because it just has the magic that Hollywood once cultivated so readily but now has largely forgotten. It is enthralling and larger than life, and I will gladly add this to my collection of films, right next to \"Singing in the Rain\" and \"An American in Paris.\" It really is that good.",

It's a beautiful film in more ways than one, with gorgeous visuals and cinematography, great camerawork, and inspired writing/directing from Chazelle, giving off that rare magic that is so very difficult to transmit - it feels nostalgic and speaks to something deep within the soul. Gosling and Stone deliver outstanding and often times hilarious performances with the chemistry between them being absolutely electric; their musical pieces feel genuine because they are not loud, brash numbers that feel like they've been professionally produced, nor are they quite pitch perfect all of the time. Of course, the soundtrack is genius: heartfelt, authentic and sincere, tying everything together. I don't know that that this is what you'd call a 'crowd pleaser' -- it may be just be too artsy for that -- but it is a special kind of film and I can't believe that there won't be a lot of people who will feel the sparks. It's for the ones who dream, foolish as they may seem; for the romantics and the creatives. Absolutely memorable.",

This time, we visited again the love story of Mia () and Seb (Ryan Gosling), like the first viewing we experience the love story for the first half and expect a classic Hollywood happy ending. When the audience feel comfortable with the story, it will hit you with a realistic scenario between two lovers. People could blame either of them for the failings of their relationship, but with a more objective eye. It's just two people at the right time at the right place couldn't bring their relationship into fruition because of the ensync of their life. If they stayed together they could both drag each others down, it's true love to let them go and find their passion. Seb for the first time out his way to make Mia happy and end up with their first argument. Mia on the other hand follow her passion and became successful. It's a tragic story if you expect an classic romantic happy ending but it's an happy ending for people who experience love in real life when people rarely being together at the same time to became a true long loving relationship. A lesson here is there is no lesson just life as the way it's. At the end, a smile to acknowledge between two past lovers to know true love is to happy for what they are. \n",

However, these things were all smoke and mirrors to me, to hide the fact that the story was shallow and pretentious. It just wasn't all that interesting and couldn't hold my attention. The characters were annoying as hell; Gosling's character is essentially a Jazz snob (why are they all like that?) and Stone was plain whiney.  Also, neither of them can sing or dance, so that kinda ruined the whole show.  Is it just me or do Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling just seem to play the same people in every one of their movies? I feel like they're the same no matter what roles they play (it's the same with Ryan Reynolds) as though their acting spectrum is very limited so they can't take on a wide variety of diverse roles.

            "content": "GREG: (Greg Smith, Founder of Agile Writers of Richmond, VA) Well Scott, are you Ga Ga over La La Land?\n\nSCOTT: (Dr. Scott Allison, Professor of Psychology, University of Richmond) La La Land was definitely not doo doo and much better than so so. Let s recap.\n\nGREG: We re introduced to bright and emerging actress Mia (Emma Stone). She is trying out for a number of movies and has big dreams of becoming a movie star. But first she must work in the movie studio s coffee shop as a barista. She goes to a restaurant at Christmastime where she hears a young Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) playing a piano. Things aren t going so well for young Sebastian as he is summarily fired for not playing holiday standards.\n\nSCOTT: Mia and Sebastian s paths keep crossing. Eventually they go out, enjoy great chemistry together, and fall in love. Sebastian meets an old friend and bandmate who invites Sebastian to join his band. The offer is lucrative, and Sebastian accepts but is dismayed to discover that the band s music is uninteresting and a total sell-out. Meanwhile, Mia s one-woman play is a total bust, sending Mia home to live with her parents in Nevada.\n\nGREG: The opening scene of La La Land is a massive production number where all the (young) drivers in Los Angeles  gridlock get out of their cars and sing and dance. This is a promise that we re in for a classic musical ala the 1940 s. But it is a promise that will soon be broken as the leads in this story really don t sing or dance very much. And when they do it is the minimum necessary. La La Land is a huge disappointment. It wouldn t have been so bad if that were the only flaw. But this movie fails on every level. Musical: the songs are abandoned at about the 25% point. Dance: Stone and Gosling barely perform - I ve seen better work on TV s Dancing with the stars. Plot: This is a hackneyed story that has little depth. Jazz: Gosling s thing is that he wants everyone to love Jazz. And by the end of the story we don t care one wit about Jazz. It s a story full of promises that are never delivered upon.\n\nSCOTT: I disagree, Greg. Yes, La La Land is lightweight fun but it is fun nonetheless. The film is packed with visual and emotional appeal. At the visual level, we are treated to delightful cinematography capturing the spirit of the southern California lifestyle and the glamor of the entertainment industry. At an emotional level, we fall in love with the idea of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling falling in love. There is a palpable spark between them, made more poignant by their professional struggles. The heroes of the story are the romantic duo of Mia and Sebastian. We can tell they are destined to fall in love because they dislike each other at the outset. La La Land is clever in its introduction to our heroes. There is a minor road rage incident, a snub at a nightclub, and an annoying party song request. Each hero hits a low point; his is at the beginning, hers is toward the end. There are no villains, other than the difficult entertainment industry in which they work. The journey consists of them helping each other succeed, and the adventurous storyline exudes fun, energy, wit, and charm.\n\nGREG: I had no problem with these characters as the leads - except that there was nothing particularly interesting about them. Gosling did a good job as the jazz pianist - apparently playing the piano himself in scenes that required it. Aside from one scene where he explains jazz to Mia, we don t really get to see his passion. And when Mia encourages him to try out for a band, he resists at first, then joins up. Apparently he had personality conflicts with the leader (played by John Legend). But we never really see these conflicts. And our hero seems to genuinely enjoy playing the  new jazz.  So it s a bit of a surprise when he claims he only joined because Mia exhorted him to. Likewise with Mia s talents. Sebastian encourages Mia to stop auditioning and work on her one-woman show. Which she does and when only a handful of people show up, she decides to quit acting altogether. But then a casting agent saw the show and wants to cast Mia in a major feature. And we have the same problem again - we never saw the one-woman show. So we have no idea whether she was any good in it. The only real example of Mia s acting we get is a monologue where she reminisces about an aunt who got a passing mention in an earlier scene. It s truly a touching moment - possibly the only one in the film. So I m pretty unenthusiastic about this romantic hero pairing. There s a lot of talk about their relative passions, but very little of it is on-screen. We just have to take their word for it. So I ll go back to the old saw about writing -  show, don t tell. \n\nSCOTT: They showed plenty to me. Sebastian s passion for jazz jumped off the screen for me, and inspired me (a disliker of jazz) to actually enjoy the music I heard in this movie. It was all  show  and very little  tell . And thank God they didn t show Mia s one-woman show; what a waste that would have been. We witnessed her talent big-time during her failed auditions, where she was jinxed time and again. This year we ve explored the important role of mentoring in the movies, and this movie could serve as an example of a story that works just fine without mentoring. The reason is that our two heroes help each other transform -- a type of peer assisted transformation. Mia helps Sebastian learn to follow his dream, a conceptual transformation for him. In turn, he helps her by getting her to the movie audition -- a mechanical transformation. That s more black-and-white than it really is, but the point is that any mentoring they received happened earlier in their lives, with Sebastian getting great keyboard training and Mia some impressive acting lessons.\n\nGREG: Once again, as with so much in this film, the mentoring is off-camera. There was so much that was off-camera in this film I felt that I didn t really need to be in the theater. La La Land is a film that promised much and delivered little. Even it s opening scrawl promised it would be a Cinemascope classic. But it pales in comparison to such classics as Singin  in the Rain and Top Hat. Those films, even with their limited plotlines, delivered amazing songs and dance routines.  I ve watched theatrical musicals. I met theatrical movies. Theatrical movies have been friends of mine. La La Land - you re no theatrical musical!  I give La La Land just 2 out of 5 Reels. The heroes in this film are flimsy and uninteresting. They scarcely have an arc that I could detect. The one saving grace is the last scene which was a  what could have been  montage. That was a welcome diversion from an otherwise ho-hum hero s journey. I give the heroes in this film just 2 out of 5 Heroes. And the mentoring was non-existent save for the owner of Mia s coffee shop. 1 Mentor for her. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:\n\nSCOTT: La La Land is a spirited visual and musical spectacle that will keep your toes tapping and your heart singing long after you leave the theater. Ryan Gosling and Emma stone enjoy a sizzling romance that struggles to bloom and then lights up the big screen. I fell in love with the idea of them falling in love, and I wasn t disappointed at all by the clever, realistic ending that showed them in different places yet forever changed by each other. La La Land falls just shy of earning all 5 points but does merit a festive 4 Reels out of 5. Our two star-crossed lovers win our hearts with their sweet intentions, winning dispositions, and boundless talent. Ryan Gosling always amazes me by portraying characters whom I shouldn t like but nevertheless find myself rooting for. Emma Stone remains one of the most mega-talented actors in Hollywood, and together these two stars make magic in the theater. Their hero s journeys are textbook and I enjoyed watching them help each other transform into entertainers who achieve their full potential. They easily earn 4 Hero points out of 5. There is no mentoring per se in this movie, at least not on-screen, but this is a film that doesn t require mentoring to be effective. So no worries at all (from me) in assigning 1 single measly Mentor point out of 5. Movie: Mentors: Heroes:",

The great musical movie performers who are watching from above were probably either laughing at the attempt or crying because it was so wrong.

The film opened with a song that I was not happy, because I did not like the verse or the music. And again to say, the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme, unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film. \n\nThe best part of the film was, those song fades away as the film progresses. But I kind of liked the drama/story part and the climax track with the quick flashback (kind of). Till that scene I was considering it an average film, but that one scene changed my stance. So, now I think it is a good film, but winning 6 Oscars, I don't know it deserved that.\n\nYes, the director is known for making music and musical film, but he has not made many. He's young and so his career. Yep, I loved 'Whiplash'. One of my all time favourite. If that film had won 10 Oscars, I would have not surprised at all. After that flick, the people were anticipating, to exceed that success in this film. As it was received, no doubt for those people it was a different flick, but not for me. Especially if you watch lots of Indian films. By the way the film characters were nice, and so the story, but not the songs.\n\nGosling and Stone were performed well. The chemistry between them was great. The narration was going decently until the end, which reminded me 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya' ending that I was not happy about, yet something different than usual. Sometimes I am okay with clich\u00e9 than this kind of conclusion, just to bring a change in storytelling. Overall an enjoyable film, most people would love it. Some like me would say it is a decent flick, but there's always a few who would never favour it. Yet worth a watch.\n\n7/10",

It's vibrant, buoyant, and sweet, but it has a sadness about it too, and in that sadness is where it is most effective.  The story itself is a pretty standard romance, but the dazzling chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone helps to 'elevate' (heh heh) this movie from what it is, and give it a boost to the head of the pack.  The film's light tone is noticeably different than any other movie nominated this year... perhaps that's why it's the front-runner.  Just like the classic Hollywood musical, it's escapism at its best.  As a musical, it's only fair-to-middling as the music itself is not all that good, but as a modern throwback, it's genius.  This is a film that people who have a strong knowledge and appreciation of classic Hollywood films will eat up with a spoon, while the lay-person will probably not see what's so special about it.  While I can appreciate it for what it is - film that has essentially created its own genre - it's just not my kind of movie.",

However my girlfriend absolutely wanted to watch it so I got it. As it turned out my girlfriend had only gone by the number of Oscars and not really looked up what kind of movie it actually was so in the end I was enjoying the movie a lot more than she did.\n\nThis movie is pretty much a quite classical Hollywood musical with a non too original story, nice music and dancing. In addition the cinematography  is simply excellent. This is the strong point of this movie. The rest of the movie is of lesser interest to me but the cinematography is really, really good. The scene, pictured on the movie poster, were Mia and Sebastian dances and everything in the scene are dark blue tones except Mia's bright yellow dress is so simple and yet so beautiful.\n\nEverything else about this movie is...okay. Okay acting, okay story etc.  As I wrote before this is really not my kind of movie so forgive me for not being overly enthusiastic. I am sure those into these kind of movies cannot understand how anyone can give it less than a full set of stars but hey, different tastes and all that.\n\nI cannot make up my mind about ending. On one hand I am a sucker for happy endings which this one falls a wee bit short on. On the other hand I have to commend the writer/director for not taking the path of least resistance and instead putting together something a wee bit different.\n\nI did feel that a part of the movie was missing though. I would have liked to see the parts where Mia and Sebastian actually fulfilled their respective dreams. Jumping fast forward to the ending like the movie did felt a bit like they either ran out of money or they manage to misplace half the story!\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would.",

It sounds simple, but can\u00e2(TM)t be overlooked. The songs written for this are almost all great. They advance the story logically, are catchy, and masterfully executed. The pairing of Ryan Gosling (Sebastian Wilder) and Emma Stone (Mia Dolan) once again delivered. Their chemistry is unmatched in Hollywood right now. Each scene together is well acted and both sing way better than you\u00e2(TM)d probably expect. Damien Chazelle wrote this movie years before it came out because studios wanted to change his vision. Waiting was the best route to go, because this got made in his vision and was gorgeous. The backdrops and landscapes looked incredible. Chazelle made sure to provide us with a ton of beautiful shots to showcase this. The script is wonderful and provides us with fully fleshed out characters who grow over the course of the film. I really like how the movie avoids the clich\u00c3 (C)d ending and gives us something different. The characters don\u00e2(TM)t have to end up together for the story to work and this proves that. The movie also nails all the little moments throughout that make it special. \n\nWeaknesses: This could\u00e2(TM)ve used another song or two. Think about The Greatest Showman. It is packed with fantastic musical numbers and I think this could\u00e2(TM)ve benefitted from at least one more. There are a few pacing issues, causing the film to feel like it drags a bit at certain points.\n\nOverall: A gorgeous movie driven by top notch direction, tremendous acting, likable characters, and catch tunes. This should\u00e2(TM)ve won Best Picture.",

There are regular superhero movies where you feast your eyes upon the visual effects, there are generic animated movies with the critically acclaimed ones being the 2 cartoons from Disney and an amazing animated flick that no one saw, there are the average actioners, thought-provoking dramas, etc. La La Land provides a fresh change of pace by offering a pleasantly retro feel with the visual style, sets, shout-out to films released in the 40's and 50's among them Casablanca and Rebel Without a Cause and even the score. Which is odd yet fresh since the film takes place in the present day. The score and musical numbers are amazing. I'll probably be listening to the soundtrack tons of times on YouTube until all of them entirely invade my head. Personally, my favourite one is City of Stars. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have great chemistry together with the film having tons of charm. Seeing Gosling defending jazz in one scene proves just how, like many people who go to work in Los Angeles, determined he is in what he does. Even if you have no interest in films such as The Sound of Music and My Fair Lady, this film's soundtrack is enough to make this film worth watching as it serves as a proud throwback to the old Technicolor musicals from the early 20th century. La La Land is a wonderful treat that becomes unexpectedly heartbreaking by the third act and provides a fresh change of pace from all the big blockbusters Hollywood dishes out nowadays. *awkward silence accompanied by crickets chirping* What, were you expecting a witty La La Land/Moonlight joke?

Unforgetable and heart wrenching with a musical scores that dwellled long long after the film..  Incredible performance by Ryan and Emma with singing, dancing and musical skills so authentic. La la land is as magical and thrilling as all the hype and excitement suggested. Since I don't go to the cinema anymore, its a six months wait from screening to receiving my Bluray. It was worth the wait to watch it privately on 4K 65\" TV to avoid annoying noisy potato chips crunching neighbours in a ciniema. Nothing must disturb me while I watch this great follow up on Whiplash from Damien Chazelle in creating this romance musical. Musicals is a tough genre because very few musicals have impressed me, perhaps because I haven\u00b4t been impressed with the castings of musical movies. Not Chicago, or All that Jazz or Ma Ma Mia or the most recent Les Mizerables. But La La has hit the ball out of the court. It had  two of the most winsome darlings and talented actors, Ryan and Emma. Their on screen chemistry was magic. The heart simply soared to dizzy heights while watching them dance and sing. All focus centred on Ryan and Emma while everything else became oblivious and unimportant. Most scenes if not all were one shot long sequences underlining how challenging it was for the actors to get it right over a five minute non stop shot. The choreography and set decorations were too beautiful for words. The ending was a reality bite because two talented people who are in love must go their separate ways because they had to make painful personal sacrifices including saying goodbye to sweet love in order to entertain the masses one day. At least hopeless romantics like myself were treated to an alternate reality where Ryan and Emma would live together happily ever after. A greatly underrated actor, Gosling was brilliant at the piano with many close up scenes of his fingerings on the keyboard. Yes, it was all Ryan. No doubles. It was heartening to have Chazelle so young and talented because we look forward to seeing more gems from him in the future.",

The acting is superb, the music is f*cking amazing (Epilogue is the single greatest piece of musical score that I have ever heard), the choreography is extremely impressive, the direction is fabulous, and the cinematography and set design are spectacular. You know a film is a amazing when the only part of a film you dislike, is still one of the best scenes of the movie. I think that the observatory scene feels a little out of place, and takes the movie from an 'as believable as it gets musical' to two superheroes hanging in the air (I guess Spiderman didn't kill Gwen this time ;).)\n\n\nOverall La La Land is simply put the best movie of 2016 (top 3 of the decade), and should have easily won the Best Picture Oscar. (For those people who call this overrated, clearly you haven't seen the definition of overrated. It's directed by Barry Jenkins, and is called Moonlight.)",

Though, as amateurs, emma and ryan made a wonderful job. La la land made me dream and will forever be part of my favorite movies. It plays between realism and fantasy, it also has some visionnary shots. The director clearly is a genius.

La la land felt like an intense attempt to look like an old school version super imposed on a modern day scenario, but failing miserably to produce a fraction of the emotional resonance that a musical should. The present's wrappings were spectacular, but there was nothing inside. I'm still not clear on what exactly drew the romantic leads to one another. What did they like? Passion for their individual dreams was inferred, but not exactly developed. Their love affair was even more fragile then explained by a few critics. While I got a small kick out of the inside LA references, it only served to remind me of the multitude of reasons why I can't stomach living there long term. (I grew up in LA). Everybody is jockeying for position, but substance is practically non-existent. There's a party somewhere every night of the week, and everybody is working their ass off to get that one break, but the question is Why??? Fame, fortune, visibility? Whatever happened to telling a really, really good story? To me, this was a paper thin story... kind of like modern day Hollywood. The storytellers have left the building. Only the template is left. Gorgeous sets, check. Frame for frame nods to past classics, check. Camera angles, check. Facial and body blocking shots of impossibly camera friendly actors, check. Exactly structured musical numbers with impossibly cheesy writing, check. But you forgot the substance, The profundity. They tried an Umbrellas of Cherbourg ending, but failed to recognize that Umbrellas was written in a time when people still believed in love to the point where lives were irretrievably altered and devastated if lovers didn't make it long term. You can tell nobody really believes in love like that in the movie. Not to where it alters you. It's implied, but you don't feel it. I didn't feel ANYTHING. Which is too bad, because I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling's acting. I just wish they had b,een given more to work with.",

Having now seen the film, I must say I'm sorry Mr. Jackson. Your contention was not in vein. La la land's numerous Oscar wins may be the proof we needed to show that the Academy is overrun by a certain demographic: those who remember the 1950's and 60's with fondness, and likely shed a tear in nostalgic reminision when Ryan Gosling tapped his feet and Emma Stone squealed in delight.\n\nI'm four months pregnant and watching La la land was more nauseating than morning sickness.",

            "content": "The movie musical is something of the past. Bygone. Dormant.\nThe genre's attempted revival arrived last year via Damien Chazelle in the form of alleged crowd-pleaser La La Land, a weakly conceived project whose disappointing first act flows into a second that achieves striking depths of dullness. The film's only truly magnificent scene is it's very last, meaning that the credits start rolling as soon as you've become truly engaged. \n\n\"Another Day of Sun\" kicks the film off. Rather clumsily. The song is a sprightly, uplifting ditty that ultimately has no lasting effect because it's wasted on an idiotic, messily choreographed and haphazard dance number that features nameless, curiously uncharacterized folk clumsily clamoring over traffic-halted cars in one moment and a blonde proudly flashing her undergarments in the next. It's an incredibly rough start to a dishearteningly mediocre movie.\n\nSoon after comes the introduction of wannabe actress Mia. Her first interaction with Sebastian is an egregious, unabashed raise of the middle finger, immediately establishing her petulant, whiny, puerile mess of a character. It also doubles as a gesture to viewers who are anticipating a film that is innovative and intelligent. Mia is played laboriously by the otherwise insanely likable Emma Stone, whose inherent charms are one of La La Land's few saving graces. Ryan Gosling's performance as pianist Sebastian (or \"Seb,\" as he's most commonly referred to as) isn't much better, and the popular actor goes on to prove through the movie's flurry of songs that he, for the life of him, can't sing or carry a tune. The only likable characters, Mia's delightful roommates, are stranded in extremely minor roles. The horribly overrated John Legend also appears, and he's forced to perform as a character even more dull and obnoxious than the two protagonists combined. He's also tasked with carrying the weight of the worst song in the entire film.\n\nThe majority of the music mostly goes to waste, which, needless to say, is a deadly mistake for a musical to make. Each song is undermined by awkward camerawork, uninspired visuals, and a general lack of inspiration. There's a nagging sense of familiarity that can't be shaken. The aptly named \"Epilogue\" is the only tune that avoids those four fatal attributes and it truly succeeds in making a lasting impression, along with the scene it accompanies. The conclusion is moving, well-filmed, and evocative- three things the rest of the film only wishes it was.\n\nPerhaps the picture's greatest sin is its utter inability to deliver on it's lofty promise. La La Land is widely praised as a pure delight and return to glory for the musical genre, when it fails to qualify as either of those things. The film is not intellectually inclined and is content to deliver an unbelievably cliched and overused message: follow your dreams. Countless other movies and works of fiction have made the pursuit of one's dreams it's central theme with rocky results, and it's crystal clear that Damien Chazelle and the screenwriters did not learn from them.\n\nThe poorly drawn characters, weak writing, and the lack of a brain to go with its beating heart render La La Land a mostly unspectacular dud, unworthy of its effusive acclaim and glowing reputation. The film has noble intentions, but they never come to fruition. It's more a celebration of insecure brats that don't know how to pursue their dreams in a rational fashion than a loving homage to the Hollywood of old. A better title for this misfire would be \"Blah Blah Bland.\"",

What makes the film, for me, is the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.

The musical numbers were really well thought out with most of them designed to appear as single take shots, and they all had great direction in the camera work, cinematography, timing, and choreography. Emma Stone has been my favorite actress for years now, probably since at least Zombieland and Easy A, and she really shines here and easily deserves the awards she won for the role, as do most of the people involved in this movie. While the movie takes place in modern day, it does a great job bringing the nostalgic feel of older movies and times, and this mixing of new and old plays a central role in the story as well, so it's the perfect style to tell this story in. I'm also glad to see another musical taking on the live singing approach we first saw in the new Les Mis\u00e9rables movie, as I think it does a lot to add to the realness of the performances, which can otherwise sometimes feel phoney during those big musical numbers. La La Land was my favorite movie of 2016, and is a classic I know I'll be watching again and again.\n\nPersonal Grade: S++\nTechnical Score: 98%",

Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling shine in great performance roles that they mold into their own, never feeling like they're acting but rather let their characters leap off the screen and allow the viewer to fill in all the emotion that they are going through. Again highlighting the fantastic music and the natural performances, combined with Chazelles uses of long takes and pans takes you back to the Hollywood of old, when you needed to be a true performer (singing, dancing, acting) and gives off a stage show feel on the silver screen. \n\nThe use of colour and light is brilliant, every shot feeling structured, planned, and well executed to provide optimum emotional value and connection to our dreamers. Again, driven by a fantastic screenplay and strong performances across the board - this is a movie that belongs in everyone's library. Especially the aspiring film makers - everything you want to learn about how to make a great film is here. Which is what makes it great - redundantly. \n\nAll great films are teaching films.

I respect that Ryan Gosling worked very hard so he could appear as if he were playing the piano, but his singing voice is terrible.  Emma Stone was slightly better (especially in the audition song), but not amazing.  There are better singers in the shows on cruise ships.  In the heyday of the hollywood musical, the two \"stars\" would have been dubbed.\n\nSimilarly, the dancing was OK, but not world-class.  \n\nAt a time when musicals are rare - why not get the best musical talent?",

While watching this movie i at so many instances felt that what the character was feeling in that moment i could relate to that and one of the scenes when Emma Stone's character says Maybe i am not just good enough to do this and that hits a little close to home. This movie relates so well to each one of us in different ways, maybe you relate to the romantic factor of this movie, maybe the rejection factor or maybe you want to feel what its like to be in love.

It is a musical about an actress (Emma Stone) and a musician (Ryan Gosling) who are trying to get their carriers off the ground. La La Land was a surprise for me. All it really is, is a mid-20th century musical with modern-day revisement. It was a masterpiece. This flick had some solid performances that really stood out. The use of color was noticeably good, along with some of the best lighting of that year. The story was compelling as well. I thought it was unpredictable, in a good way. La La Land is truly a game-changing film. It is in my opinion, a movie that brought back the genre.\nOver all, La La land is the very definition of a love letter to Hollywood. It is by-far the best musical of recent years. 5/5 stars",

Damien Chazelle's ambition and skill as a director make this film the dream-like experience it is. Very few directors can handle the surreal without becoming pretentious, luckily Damien is one of them. Our leads are wonderful as singers, dancers, musicians and actors, particularly Emma Stone who gives a naturalistic and breath-taking performance. The score and soundtrack are both wonderful experiences on their own, while still remaining important to the plot of the film. The best musicals are ones that use music to foreshadow events in the story or convey a character's emotion, and this film does just that. However, what really makes this film is the cinematography. Almost every scene has expertly crafted use of colour, camera movement, choreography and detail. Because of this, you can rewatch the film several times and notice new things you didn't before, enhancing the experience. La La Land is a film that perfectly encapsulates dreams and dreamers, and the dangers that come with both.",

            "content": "I am going to try to convince you to see this fantastic movie : La La Land ! It is really one of the best film I have ever seen in my life...  So, La La Land is a musical directed in 2016 by Damien Chazelle (who won the Academy Award for Best Director) and the two lead actors are Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.\nLa La Land tells the story of Mia (Emma Stone), an aspiring actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a dedicated jazz musician who are both passionnate about dance and singing. They meet in Los Angeles and a love story is set up between the two characters. But the plot is really based on their career : their tries, their successes and mostly their failures... \nThe acting is just amazing ! Well, of course Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are originally brilliant actors but in this musical, they overstep the mark and they explode the screen. Their roles are extremely difficult seeing as they have to dance and sing. It is not regular to see actors in this position. This movie is hard to play because it brushes past different genres : it is of course a musical and all the difficulties that it represents for the acting but it touches also the romance, the comedy and finally the drama genre. So I can say that the actor's performance is absolutely great ! By the bye, Emma Stone won the Academy Award for Best Actress In A Leading Role for her Mia's role in La La Land.\nIt seems to me very important to write some words about the film techniques... Just to precise, to the Academy Awards Ceremony, La La Land cleared out the Award for Best Original Music Score, the Award for Best Cinematography and the Award for Best Production Design ! There is something which is magic in this movie : the atmosphere. In fact, the story takes place in present days but the setting, the costumes are older : it feels like being in the United States in the 50's. It is very funny and enjoyable. What about music ? Well, of course it is the common thread of the movie. But it takes a particular place for the characters : for exemple, one of the song is often repeated by Mia and Sebastian when they are sad or demotivated... and another one is characteristic of happy moments. The movie plays also on lighting sometimes like when a spotlight is pointed at an actor so as to give a kind of theatrical effect to the scene.\nOf course La La Land wants to stage actors who represents the difficulties and all the hard process to get their break in the world of theatre, cinema and music. But even if La La Land presents a dramatic aspect of this situation, the movie encourages people to have dreams and to believe in its. Furthermore, (SPOILER ALERT) in the film, the love story have not a happy ending but it allows them to progress in their carrer and to do evoluate the two characters : it is a springboard. So, La La Land is not just a superficial romance but it deals also with important topics. \nIt is just gorgeous, like a flipbook made of dreamy vintage postcards that are somehow about contemporary life in Los Angeles. Chazelle's strong direction coupled with powerful performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling help to create a wonderful and nostalgic treat at the cinema. I think it would be a shame to do not see La La Land seeing as it is still the most rewarded film this year !",

My problems with the film started after around the 1 hour mark, the story kinda collapses into clich\u00e9s and becomes quite unoriginal, despite the ending, I really liked how the film conluded. Overall I think it's a lovely film with a brilliant performance by Emma Stone, great dance numbers and some solid songs.",

It didn' t really fail on all these counts, but neither did it trully commit to any of them.\n   The plot is to me the stereotypical hollywood success story that tries and fails to disguise itself as an emotional acount of the rejection and sucrifice in persuit of dreams. \n   Acting-wise Gosling was good, Stone was better but undeserving of an Oscar.\n   In the end it was mainly Damien Chazelle' s unconventional direction that saved this movie from being a complete dissapointment. He managed to create visually stunning compositions that are both dreamlike and emotionally impactful. Unfortunately his work is not supported by the other elements of this movie that ends up paling in comparison to his previous work 'Whiplash'.",

This film has a look and feel that hearkens back to the Technicolor musicals of the '60s (I was particularly reminded of West Side Story), but with modern updates to camera technique, acting, and pacing. From what I could tell, most, if not all, of the musical numbers were recorded in a single take, including a tour de force opening number on a jam-packed freeway on-ramp. The camera swoops and glides, yet the action is always perfectly framed. Emma Stone performed powerfully, while Gosling seemed totally natural, which takes a whole other level of skill to achieve. There are a few fantasy sequences, which may confuse some people, but they showcase the director's deft handling of light and colour. This is a film for film-lovers.",

The movie would've fared better had it not been a musical. La La Land desperately needs better choreographers and more memorable songs. While it executes its simple story well with believable character development, the sections of the movie where they break into song lack energy and have you waiting for the next bit of the story to come along.\n\nHowever, every other aspect of the movie is great and one thing that makes the simple story stand out is the film's excellent use of its scenery and camera to craft imagery that is not only great to look at, but has a wealth of symbolism hidden within. Every scene in the movie has an artistic attention to detail that is nothing short of poetic. La La Land is a good movie, but a mediocre musical.\n\nWhile it is a bland musical, there are a two exceptions in it regarding its songwriting, as \"City of Stars\" and \"Fools Who Dream\" are excellently written and stand out among the movie's mostly generic lyrical pieces. The instrumental soundtrack, however, is a different story, and is excellent all throughout. Unfortunately, two good songs and great instrumentals are not enough to get a musical going and need good choreography to lift it all up. The slow camera pans, while difficult to do, as it means the scene needs to be taken in one cut, is an overused effect that actually harms the movie rather than benefit it. This effect is one reason why the movie's musical sections feel bland, taking away some energy that could've been gained by having extra camera angles and it is worsened by being used in every scene in the movie, instead of saving it for the slower, more impactful moments. I understand that the effect was to further the Broadway feeling, but then the choreography should've been better to make up for it.\n\nAll in all, La La Land could've been better. I've taken a half star off the movie for the bland feel and gave the movie a lot of credit for the poetic visuals. The movie has a slow start, but makes up for it with a well executed ending that effectively demonstrates the movie's great sense of imagination and the symbolism that not many movies can do.",

For examples, watch An American in Paris, Singin' in the Rain, or The Band Wagon to see what I mean. What makes Chazelle's 3rd feature so incredible is how brilliantly he understand how to reference history. He skillfully recontextualizes the vernacular of the American musical for the modern age. The exquisite score by Justin Hurwitz, elaborate production design by David Wasco, those costumes by Mary Zophres, the Technicolor, the romance - La La Land's aesthetic borrows from history but the time period and the characters are rooted firmly in contemporary society. 2016 is all here: cell phones, Hybrid vehicles, the part-time job as a barista. Chazelle makes our present era seem so much more magical. There is an exuberant quality I haven't seen recently.  Mia and Sebastian radiate sweetness too. This uncorrupted pair shares a purity. You want them to be together. Their emotion is real. You fall in love. This why we go to the cinema. If I may paraphrase a famous expression once said by Humphrey Bogart, La La Land is the stuff that [movies] are made of. It is sublime.\n\nfastfilmreviews.com",

Can't really find a tangible gripe for it, so I guess that means it's one worth recommending.\n\nMy main hiccup with this movie is that it is completely safe. This is a movie that clearly aims for \"Best Picture\" heights, because nothing is quite so ingratiating to Hollywood than a movie about Hollywood. Especially when this \"La La Land\" in question is presented with virtually no flaws or corruption. I understand that the film is doing this intentionally, and that the whole idea of the aesthetic is to bring back visions of the Gene Kelly golden age of Hollywood musicals. And to that end, the film is executed with near-perfect precision. But I could not help but keep thinking back to \"Whiplash\" and how bold that film was both in presentation and the statements it was making. This film is likewise about never giving up on dreams, and the more realistic, non-coruscating elements which bookend the film promise a real payoff on that front. But the majority of the movie's main body is so concerned with getting just the right lighting, just the right dance moves, and just the right timing that much of the blood, sweat and tears that come along with that promise are cast aside. \n\nThis is a movie that simultaneously knows exactly what it wants to be and yet flirts with something dingier and more poignant. And my admittedly personal tastes almost always respond more to the latter. So for me, this film is a technical marvel that objectively deserves all of its accolades from a purely cinematic place of critique, but it just doesn't have anything truly original or memorable to say. And that is disheartening, because Damien Chazelle might just be the most talented person in movies today. I just hope he continues to push himself and his audience into more groundbreaking territory in the future.",

But I can't help it. I love Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I love a musical, and I love the classic style. You can tell me all day long about how Stone is breathy, Gosling looks at his feet when he dances, I don't care. I liked the way it made me feel, and I left humming under my breath and dancing up the stairs. I went into the theater for my first viewing in the throes of an existential crisis (which come around every other week). I was immediately invested in the characters and cried for a majority of the second half. A few weeks later, I went in for another show time because I was worried I wasn't in a stable mental state the first time around. I cried (slightly) less in my second showing, but it still felt as connected. Flat out it was a beautifully shot, exciting, catchy frolic through every young dreamer's fantasy in LA. 9.8/10",

            "content": "I confess I don't pay much attention to movie buzz or awards shows. Sometimes, this leads to surprises, such as when I left the theater of one of the worst movies I've seen in a year, only to near-literally run face-first into the promotional cutout for La La Land, gilded with rave-review quotes and blaring award nomination claims.\n\nI have been mystified ever since. La La Land is awful. Just awful. It's not even good at what it tries to be; not a single song from the movie stuck with me the moment the last note faded. Ostensibly a throwback to the Good Old Days (ugh), it only manages to succeed in that respect by virtue (read: detriment) of its hideous whiteness. It's just... \n\nOkay, you know what? Let's just get into it.\nMia (played by the usually delightful Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress, living with a bunch of disposable women so unimportant they only exist to unconvincingly suggest Mia is white-people-version-of-struggling financially, and to sing an instantly-forgettable song about Mia prostituting herself at a Showbiz Industry Party on the chance someone might notice her, then disappear and are never heard from again. Which is fitting, since Mia is similarly a barely two-dimensional prop for the men behind (and in front of) the cameras.\nNot that we believe Mia is struggling; she works as a barista for the rich and famous, right in the rosy-pink cornhole center of Peckerwood, Crackerfornia. (Seriously, this movie couldn't get any whiter.)\n\nSebastian (played by the perpetually sleepy-eyed, yet usually likable Ryan Gosling) lives alone (in a place he couldn't afford) because nobody could possibly like this self-satisfied, pretentious douchebag. He's also broke (see above, re: couldn't afford), because he keeps getting fired for being a self-satisfied, pretentious douchebag. We're supposed to sympathize with him because reasons. They actually give a reason, but it's a stupid one, because this prick should have been fired long before he proved what a pompous tool he is by demanding his version of purity.\n\nWhaddya mean, \"purity\", you ask? What, is he a jazz fan or something? OF COURSE HE'S A JAZZ FAN. What other kind of music could such a strident, humorless, unlikeable asshole possibly take mortally seriously than the music of pretentious hacks and dilettantes? Oh, and he plays it, too, because duh. Jazz is the music of frustrated mediocrity. But I won't hold that against the movie.\nI digress. \nIt also doesn't help that he's another white knight - emphasis on the white - trying to save The Blah People from themselves, as amply demonstrated when he inexplicably lands a paying gig with a jazz-ish-sorta-not-exactly-inspired fusion band, led, of course, by one of those silly black people who ruin good music, natch. How brave to put a whitewashed spin on the norm; we've *never* seen that before. Where would black people be, without savior-douche Sebastian to reverse-Pat Boone them?\n\nSo. Mia and Sebastian (Goddess Eris, even his *name* is intolerable) meet and like each other for no reason just because without explanation apropos of nothing inexplicably something something script. Not before Sebastian is a complete dick to Mia, of course. Then they sing together about how safe it is to walk around their heavily-policed, lily-white neighborhood in the middle of the night in Los Angeles. Look, I know I'm hitting the race thing pretty hard, but in my defense, they started it.\n\nThere's absolutely no tension in Mia's so-quickly-dispelled-it-never-existed resistance to Sebastian's super-winning \"charms\" (Does he pinch his ham flower so hard it could cut a railroad spike in half when Emma says she doesn't like jazz? Duh-DOY. Does he aggressively browbeat her until she says she's wrong out of sheer exhaustion? Stop asking stupid questions). Nobody in the entirety of existence believes they won't get together. IT'S IN THE MOVIE POSTER, for crying out loud. Put your lame attempts at tension somewhere you haven't already given away the resolution.\n\nSo, anyway, they have a relationship while I nodded off during a salad-days montage. Seriously, I dozed for about five minutes during this. Blah blah blah, forty excruciating minutes of Sebastian looking constipated because he's getting rich and famous by playing music people actually like, and then Mia and Sebastian have their clockwork, by-the-numbers, Big Scary Fight right on cue, and naturally, it makes no sense, with Mia and Sebastian emoting because the script says so, and not because what they're saying or doing would be upsetting. \"You want me to be HAPPY?!? THAT MAKES ME ANGRY! GRRR!\" (I'm not kidding; that was a key point in their argument.)\n\nThen follows another chance for me to take a nap, so at least there's that, while something something montage. Mia becomes rich and famous, because of course she does, despite the movie taking great pains to paint her as eminently mediocre at best. Sebastian ditches that awful black man and his soulless cultural appropriation of true, pure white aryan jazz, and starts his dream nightclub nobody would ever be interested in going to, which is of course standing-room-only filled with who-the-hipster-knows, because GAWD, what a hellhole of excrement-reeking pretentiousness and awful music. Must be a front for a meth lab or something.\n\nThen there's a montage, because of course there is. Then it ends an hour and a half too late. I won't spoil the ending, because there isn't one. Nobody learns or grows, white people succeed because of course they do, and the movie writer and a few other douchenozzles hose their shorts because jazz is awesome and not at all a dissonant, pointless, masturbatory exercise in self-congratulatory, Grateful Dead-level dicking around on instruments for musicians who were never talented enough to play music with any meaning. The End.\n\nAt least they got the name right, because La La Land is the only place this supermassive rusty bullet hole of a movie could possibly be considered good, let alone so amazingly, gloriously, fabulously scrumtrulescent that Hollywood has no choice but to explode in an auto-rimming, self-congratulatory orgasm of--\n\nOhhhhhh.

My favorite parts were when the vibe of the movie got \"real\". It stopped being a fairytale musical and started being a movie where I legitimately felt for the characters.  The worst part is I've been humming the music unconsciously for weeks now and it's driving me insane.  I probably won't ever watch it again but I'm glad I saw it.",

            "content": "La La Land is a 2016 musical drama film directed by Damien Chazelle, of Whiplash fame, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. The film follows Seb and Mia, two people with big dreams who meet and fall in love in the city of angels, L.A. Having won seven Golden Globes, the most Golden Globes won by a film, I had big expectations for the it. And I'm happy to report, I was not disappointed! \n\nThe film's two stars are truly wonderful, having both won Golden Globes for their roles. Ryan Gosling plays Sebastian, a down on his luck Jazz musician who dreams of opening his own Jazz club. Emma Stone plays an aspiring actress waiting for her big break. After a few chance encounters and musical numbers, romance blossoms for the two dreamers. Gosling and Stone's chemistry is incredible and really makes the film what it is. Their own singing and dancing in the film, while not perfect really adds a sense of realism, making the characters a lot more relatable. Special shoutout to J.K. Simmons, having played an asshole teacher in Chazelle's previous film and now playing an asshole bar owner. It's impossible not to enjoy his skills! \n\nChazelle, only 31 years old, directed the film masterfully and has shown himself to be incredibly talented, winning, you guessed it, a Golden Globe for the film! The cinematography is beautiful providing some stunning backdrops for the romantic couple as they dance away. One of my favourite aspects of the film was the use of incredibly creative transitions between scenes. Never before have I turned to my friends during the film just to talk about screen transitions but Chazelle's creativity shines through here. He's definitely a director to look out for if you weren't already! \n\nBeing a musical, the soundtrack is a key part of the film. The songs written for the film are certainly no let down, with the huge musical number opening the film and more serene throughout being very reminiscent of 50s musicals sick as Singin in the Rain. My personal favourite numbers would be Another Day of Sun and Someone in the Crowd. The film does an excellent job of providing 50s nostalgia such as the 'Cinemascope' opening and colourful costumes and sets. \n\nThe ending of the film is admittedly a little unexpected and jarring. It's certainty emotional and really drives home some interesting messages about following your dreams. The film, especially the ending, is best summed up the same way Seb describes Jazz: \"It's conflict and it's compromise. And it's very, very exciting\". \n\nOverall, the film is wonderfully crafted and a whole lot of fun. It's a real feel good film and just makes you feel like dancing. I definitely recommend it and expect to hear a lot more success from the film when the Oscars roll around. I'll certainly be singing its praises!",

            "content": "One Girl Who's Not Too Far in La La Land to See How It's Off-Beat\n\nAfter Sunday's mix-up at the Oscars many of you may be wondering how valid Moonlight's win is. I'm here to tell you that it is just. La La Land was truly a great film and they deserved to hold that Oscar, but it wasn't so great that they deserved to keep it.\n\nI grew up watching movies from the golden age of musicals and studied them in my ballroom dancing days to fine-tune my performance of numbers paying homage to the classics. So when critics began saying La La Land resurrected the musical genre I walked into the theater expecting to be taken to my happy place. \n\nI was disappointed when I was brought in and out of my nostalgic paradise by clunky and contrived transitions into and out of musical numbers, effectively categorizing each scene as either a musical or a drama. As enchanting as the movie is, it is impossible for an audience to be swept off their feet during the mess that is trying to dance with two partners.\n\nThe first, and most off-putting partner change is just after the elaborate and large opening number set in an LA traffic jam. The music and dance come to a screeching halt as our main characters, Mia and Sebastian, have their meet-cute where they exchange a honk, a finger and a glare.\n \nThe audience is forced to abruptly switch partners multiples times as we watch Mia and Sebastian repeatedly run into each other and try to suppress their increasingly romantic feelings, which leads us to the now iconic number in front of the LA city scape. The least coordinated change of partner happens in this scene when Mia sits down, removes her heels and changes into tap shoes. Now, it is my humble opinion that the only person allowed to change costuming on camera is Mister Rogers but keep in mind that our neighbor intentionally did it to signify the beginning and end of something. \n\nIn any case, our tedious tango between drama and musical continues as we watch Mia and Sebastian succumb to love and watch how their relationship is affected by the progression of their individual Hollywood careers. \n\nA seamless plot isn't everything in a musical; the choreography and music are important aspects to consider. Unfortunately, these aspects step on each other's toes in La La Land. The music would build to a dramatic climax while our main characters were in the middle of their 3rd set of pas de bourree's, making it seem as though the dances were originally choreographed to a different song.\n\nThe misstep between the music and the choreography has nothing to do with the score. Justin Hurwitz deserved the Oscar for Best Original Music Score by creating a beautifully whimsical yet melancholy soundtrack that perfectly encompasses the story of one's first great love.\n \nThe actors are also not to blame for La La Lands shortcomings. Emma Stone was captivating in this role which was reflected in her Oscar win for her performances as Mia. As a pair, Emma and Ryan Gosling (Sebastian) delivered an emotionally captivating performance that every person who's had a great love can relate to.\n\nLa La Land's two left feet belong to Director, Damien Chazelle, who failed to put as much energy into the flow of the film as he did every other aspect. Having received the Oscar for Best Director, Chazelle probably feels pretty satisfied with La La Land since it has all the technical components of the genre. But without proper transitioning it is overtly contrived, a critique he also received for his 2014 film 'Whiplash'. \n\nAll things considered, if a passion of romantic movies is what's leading you toward La La Land, it is a must see. The cinematography, music and acting will take you on a journey reflective of your own first great love. But if you're wanting a polished musical, know that the hard-to-get flirting between musical and drama will leave you frustrated when the two never hook-up.",

Can they sing well? nope. It felt too much like the movie was playing during an open-mic karaoke night. Honestly, I could have let that slide, if it weren't for the ridiculous insipidness of the curt wrap-up ending that had no story development  at all. A couple that declares their eternal love for another is the end of one scene. The next thing, it's 5 years later--the two of them are no longer together, she's married to a guy we've never seen and she has a young child. The audience had already been informed that she would be in rehearsal for 3 months and then in Paris for 4 months. Last time I checked, 7 months is only just over half a year and if she really was in love with Gosling's character, why would all of that have just suddenly disappeared in less than a year??? Other romantic movies have successfully pulled off the failed love story--Annie Hall and The Way We Were are great examples that come to mind. But these movies made it a major point of their story's development to show how two people who deeply love each other cannot ultimately share their lives together. This movie failed to do this on any level. If the producers of this film thought that turning the classic movie-musical on its head with a sad ending would be new and praise worthy, they clearly forgot about West Side Story, Moulin Rouge, and Sweeney Todd. Ultimately, I just felt like this movie had a lot to deliver, and it just couldn't do it.",

Nor were the actors able to pull off the dancing. I had just gone to a movie showing of Singing in the Rain. This pales in comparison. And Debbie Reynolds had never danced before! The voices weren't memorable either, but that is easier to forgive because many good musicals were hits without trained voices. Also, the acting was okay in a super simplistic plot.

Emma Stone started off with a weak, aspirate sound, and developed a fuller tone in the middle of \"Here's to the One's Who Dream.\" I am leery about Hollywood musicals because they get people who are amateur singers that look good. At least they should dub them with professional singers like they did in My Fair Lady. At least that would have really earned the award for Best Picture. I'm sorry, Ryan Gossling is an incredible actor, and man he played that piano, and yet he needs to work on his singing voice. \"City of Stars\" is too low for him. He sounded like Russell Crowe in Les Mis.\nThe writing is cliche and garbage. In fact one of the girls in the movie makes fun of the story itself. The music makes the film pop. I loved the jazz, and the chorus numbers, yet the two main songs were not very good. This film is not a musical. It's a fantasy film with musical numbers, yet the music does not flow through the movie. The dichotomy between acting and music divides the main characters rather than uniting them, until the dream sequence. Why not just end it on that note? The dream sequence added a David Lynch vibe, as if the dream were reality and the two characters were in a five year bitter sweet nightmare. If it had ended on the dream sequence then the movie would have been genius, almost equal to Mullholland Drive, or Inland Empire. Yet they take the nostalgic way and we get a cliche ending. Over all I give this film a whopping 8/10.",

In my opinion, a movie has done its job, if it made you feel something, but all I was left at the end of this movie was the feeling that it wasn't made for me, or the audience, but the 60 year old voters of the Academy.

The visuals were great but not life changing and there was some strange stuff with the stars that actually reminded me of the car flying at the end of Grease which I never understood. There is not enough if a supporting cast to make this film a great musical. The opening numbers was not necessary to the plot was hard to understand and really wasn't that greatly sung.

            "content": "My problem with La La Land\n\nI will start with what captivated me about Chazzelle's film.  The LA scenery, particularly the scene where Gosling and Stone are walking to their cars and they perform the tap number (seeing them physically change shoes for the routine was particularly cute).  The long takes.  Wow!  Such impressive hard work.  Really, hard work sums up the impression of what has been done in this picture.  Okay! Time to complain.  \nLa La Land got the most nominations at this year's Golden Globes, and won ALL OF THEM.  I do not think the movie is bad, but comparing it to it's competitors, I feel beat when it wins.  La La Land - the name invites itself to witnessing fantasy as something not attainable, or if it is, pointless and gotten by chance.  Gosling is a jazz piano player, and Stone is an actress, and their characters are written as if they've been described by a sub-par television character performed by my favorite actor, Gael Garcia Bernal, that \"they perform with the blood\", and we're expected to accept that and follow the kiddie pool plot.\n  La La - dreaming... it is what their aspirations are for the first part of the film.  The movie is broken up into Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, and 5 years later.  The seasons appear for no other purpose than to show a brief change in time.  Throughout that year in northern hemisphere exposure to the sun,  we see the leads going from embarrassing auditions and economic hardships, to giddy romance, to achieving their dreams, losing their romance, and feeling sad about it.  Sigh.  I have no idea what happened during summer.Even movie stars feel sad?  Not all that glitters is gold?  No, I'm sure there's more to it that that, but the movie blankets itself in cliches so that the plot is easy to follow - we know the story is fantasy, the characters... it's no shock to me I have no idea what their names are, they were written for the . bankability of Stone's not completely there grace within earnest gumption, and Gosling's stand in front of a voiceless band of black jazz performers, and tell you what jazz is about talents, white hollywood heartthrob talents.\nWhat's upsetting about the takeaway of awards in the acting category is not the performances.  Stone's eagerness, if not exactly moving, is at least infectious, but it is nowhere near her dualistic exude your world, and slink away performance of a recovering drug addict in Birdman.  Gosling's performance I can say less positive things for.  Most of what we think we feel from his character comes from the movie's score as he plays the piano (which I read was in fact him!), head down.  This also pales considerably against his richer work with Derek Cranfrance.  Most of Stone's real competition is in the Drama category of Globes (Portman is all things Jackie Kennedy in Pablo Loraine's 2nd best film of the year.  Ruth Negga, despite a script that's attempts for realism I'm sure writes a much more quiet portrayal of it's characters than their real life counterparts, still makes the best with it's quiet moments.  Amy Adams carries the sci-fi thriller, Arrival, and bridges the genre gap to the melodrama audience of Lifetime fair).  But it's sad to see that this minimally fleshed out character won against 20th Century Women's Dorthea, played by Annette Bening.  The focus of 20th Century Women is of a son trying to figure out his mom, getting deep and sparking insights, that burn out without reaching a conclusion to his quest.  This performance of a woman too mysterious to capture, is captivatingly performed by an actress who gets to shine brighter and more centered than she ever has in a movie, and who has been too often overlooked (for Hilary Swank).  That performance lost to that of a character whose big revealing backstory for when we got bac to her hometown was that she really always wanted to be an actress.  Oh,the power of showing someone persistently reach for their dreams, has on a group of Americans, or film makers I suppose.\n\tA movie can be more than the sum of its two-dimensional characters.  I can allow it that much patience.  I can respect how the figures on the screen are placed into position, and audience expectations that allow us to see that la la, dreaming, can look many different ways to the same person simultaneously and at different times.  The last scene in particular showed us a fantasy with a  completely different font and filter than what we had been seeing, and it was effective in how differently it appeared, but how utterly still not reality.  What holds this story back is how little it understands the richness , and variety to reality.\nOne more rant, I already mentioned it, and it's a popular critique, but really?  Ryan Gosling is going to save pure jazz?  The corruptor is John Legend?  The film acknowledges jazz's roots and dominant sourcing in the black community by the majority of silent black players in its jazz scenes, but gives that little bar a white messiah.  Now, I understand racial typecasting and stereotyping shouldn't reserve roles, but they didn't consider challenging those when casting their charming leads of their musical.\nLook, I know I personally care about these awards more than I should.  But many people do.  What we watch is important.  Yes, from the rest of our nominees it's clear that this Oscars is not #sowhite.  But it says something when brilliant white showmanship get the spotlight, and gay black boys, and strong women who had to wait still stand in the shadow.  What is it about showmanship that lets us forgive all shortcomings and sins?",

There were many supporters of this musical, and I was interested when I saw the praise it was getting and for the team behind the film. Damien Chazelle made one of my favorite movies a few years ago with Whiplash, and this looked like it could be almost as good. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have proven to be a perfect pair in past films, so this film was bound for success. This movie may have changed my mind about Musicals as a whole after watching it. Every musical number starting with the opening scene was jaw-dropping, and the choreography was absolutely amazing. The performances were all there and the direction from Chazelle is as good as it gets. One of the biggest peeves that I have about the film; though, is that the wonderful J.K. Simmons is hardly used and I was disappointed in that. Alas, there are many things to love about this film, and it will go down as one of the greatest Musicals in history when it's all said and done.",

            "content": "La La Land is a musical that is written and directed by Damien Chazelle and stars Emma Stone and my man Ryan Gosling.\nSo a while back in mid-2016 I was scrolling through my YouTube recommendations desperately searching for a new trailer for Suicide Squad (The hype was real) when I came across a trailer for a movie called La La Land. Now of course I knew next to nothing about this movie accept from the fact that it stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as the main characters, oh and it's musical. So after that I pretty much just ignored nearly all the marketing for this movie, then I heard that it had been nominated for 30 awards. That and my mom was desperate to see it. So when it came out in the local theatre I used my pocket money to pay for both of us to go see this movie and my god... this movie is AMAZING!!!!\nI'm not even kidding here this is one of the greatest films I have ever seen not just out of all the movies I saw in 2016 but one of the greatest films I've seen in years. This is coming from a guy who is really not a fan of musicals but his film was just the literal definition perfection.\nThere are 2 things that full on deserve praise weather you love or hate the movie. The camera work, the camera work in this movie is just phenomenal; there are so many times in this movie where you will be thinking how the heck they shot that scene. There are some beautiful shots in this movie that literally made my heart skip a couple of beats L,A is just stunning in this movie I loved the way it was shot. All the musical numbers are shot with long extensive shots with some with literally no jump cuts at all, which leads me to the choreography. Holy spagbowl!!! The choreography in this movie is so well done, most of these musical numbers are shot with almost no jump cuts there just long extensive and brilliantly filmed shots, the actors are literally dancing and singing for the entirety of the songs so that in affect is almost 3 minutes and these dance sequences unfold seamlessly. There is one incredible sequence where Gosling and Stone dance in front of an L, A sunset and it's just incredible. And yes the musical numbers as you can imagine are very energetic and really fun to watch.  And that is partly due to excellent directing which I'll talk more about in just a second. The set design just adds to the visual beauty of the film. I loved the films use of vibrant and colourful backgrounds at the right moments and everything else from the way the scenes were lit was just amazing.\nPretty much all the songs from this movie have been stuck in my head since Thursday which is when I saw this film. There're that good. I honestly haven't really heard any other songs in a musical that are similar to the ones in this film they're just so unique and memorable. \nDamien Chazelle's directing is up there in my top 5. I'm not even joking it's that good. The way he movies the camera in this movie alone is incredible. He tried his absolute best with this movie and it paid off tremendously and the same could be said for the script, the Chezelle's script for this movie might just be one of my favourite Screen plays of all time. This is backed up by some brilliant performance.\nRyan Gosling as usual is fantastic. I really liked how the film explored this character's passion for Jazz, you really feel for this character because he's a very passionate piano player and he can't play what he wants to play because he keeps ending up with jobs where he ends up playing Christmas songs at loads of different restaurants.  A lot of his Jokes landed really well, I really like it when you have someone who has one of the straightest faces and have him be the funniest characters and it works so well in this movie.\nEmma stone is also great in this movie. Her performance never faltered during the entirety of the films run time. Her character is very sympathetic, she's actress trying to break into the film industry and every attempt at that point really doesn't go well for her but she keeps trying. In that leads me to my favourite part of this movie.\nI absolutely loved the romance between these 2 characters. Their romance was just so touching and as well as making for most of the films funniest moments but it felt genuine and surprisingly unpredictable. A lot of romances I see these days feel very predictable and at times clich\u00e9d which is something that I criticised the film Passengers for. But this film was just unpredictable with the way it handled the romance which I thought was really refreshing \nLa La Land is at it's a core a love letter to people who are passionate about what they do, people who dream who will never stop trying to fulfil that dream, the people who want to succeed in doing what they love, someone is going to do exactly that no matter what people think of them will plot ahead. That's who this movie is aimed at. This movie is in a way grabbing anyone passionate by the shoulders and telling them to go fulfil their dreams. This movie genuinely wants people to fulfil their dreams and I really have to point out this movie is actually made by someone who clearly feels that he has done exactly that and is trying to encourage other people to do the same thing.\nI really loved this films message because I'm personally at a stage in my life where I really want to fulfil my dreams and pretty much become successful at what I love doing and what I want to do in the future. And I feel like this film got the message out their better than anything I have really seen before.\nAnd this message is told through fantastic musical numbers that never once got annoying, every time someone started singing it felt like it was just a natural progression of the film it never really felt like it was someone going \"hey this is the part where we sing\" it just felt natural which is something I usually only feel in animated movies, this movie just has such a real feeling to it.  \nLa La Land is one of the best films I've ever seen, I seriously recommend you get check this movie out guys I'm telling you it will be one of the greatest movie theatre experiences of your life.",

            "content": "Was \"La La Land\" really worth all of the hype? With performances from familiar hollywood stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, Damien Chazelle's film was inviting to all audiences, whether they be seasoned musical and cinema followers, or everyday movie go-ers. Overall, the acting, plot line, and stylistic choices are what made the film live up to its Oscar nominated potential. And here's why. \nWithout question, the actors in \"La La Land\" are talented, from the opening scene where hundreds of singers and dancers take over an LA freeway ramp, to the final audition scene that's part spoken, part sung monologue. Even if you didn't know that Ryan Gosling learned how to play piano from scratch for the film, his performance would still be just as impressive. Moreover, the chemistry he has with co star and love interest Emma Stone can be felt from the moment she first hears him perform. Their playful banter and constant sparring with one another create a fast paced and humorous love story that is impossible not to enjoy watching transpire. \nIn fact, the relationship between the two are what made the plot so successful. It didn't have your typical \"love at first sight\" or \"happily ever after\" moment, which you would assume from a film titled \"La La Land\". There was a constant contrast between romantic dreams like floating in space at the planetarium, and realistic hardships like long distance relationships or repeatedly getting rejected at auditions. It was refreshing to have realistic elements to the plot in an otherwise idealistic film.\nArguably the best element of \"La La Land\" was the director's stylistic approach to the film. Chazelle combined color and sound throughout the entire piece to mimic the style of musicals from earlier eras, all with a modern twist. For instance, there was a combination of still wide shots, and interesting points of view while synchronizing to the movements of the dancers. There was little editing done to each scene as well, making an even more seamlessly choreographed production. The deliberate use of color throughout the film was also apparent, and resembled the emotions of the characters. For instance, Emma's bold wardrobe fades to a more neutral palette as her character becomes more mature. It's little details like this that demonstrate Chazelle's craft. \nWhether it wins the Oscar or not, \"La La Land\" is deserving of all praise due to the impressive acting performances, unexpected plot line, and intentional stylistic choices. Overall, Damien Chazelle has introduced a new form of cinema that will undoubtedly inspire the film industry in the future.",

            "content": "The Hollywood musical has all but become a thing of the past and a genre that few filmmakers attempt anymore. If I'm honest, it's really no loss to me. Musicals are not something that I'm overly enthusiastic about. Growing up, I remember liking Grease and contemporary ones like Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge and, especially, John Turturro's Romance and Cigarettes were very enjoyable but, for the most part, I often overlook them. That said, with a record equaling 14 Oscar nominations and a record breaking 7 Golden Globe wins, Damien Chazelle's follow-up to the impressive Whiplash can not be scoffed at.\n\nPlot: Mia (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress in Hollywood struggling to catch a break. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is in the same boat as he dreams of getting out of playing cocktails bars and becoming a serious jazz musician. Their paths cross and as their relationship blossoms, they are faced with either stardom or holding onto true love instead.\n\nSong, dance, razzmatazz and Jazz are what's on the menu with Chazelle's latest. Whether you enjoy musicals or not will most likely play a huge part in your enjoyment of it, though. Technically, it's wonderful and Chazelle has a real handle on his musical numbers and choreography. It's also quite beautiful to behold. There's no arguing with the style on show here as it's quite a dazzling picture. However, there's very little substance underneath it's style. It suffers from a generic romantic plot and there's a few too many musical ditties to cover up it's glamorously dull narrative.\n\nI actually think I might have enjoyed it more had it been tighter. For a start it's way overlong and overstays it's welcome by a good half hour. There isn't enough material here to warrant its 2hrs 8mins running time. In fact, Chazelle really wrings the material out at the end. To paraphrase one of my six-year-old daughter's more unusual quips: 'He held onto this like he was strangling a baby's neck'. Don't get me wrong, though, the end sequence cleverly brings things full circle and doesn't succumb to formula but I got the distinct feeling that Chazelle never wanted it to finish. Like a rebuffed lover, he refused to let go. And who can blame him when he's having so much fun? I, on the hand, had had enough by that point.\n\nThis being said, it is hard to be unkind to the film as there's an obvious array of quality on display; David Wasco's production design is a sumptuous palette of colour and Linus Sandgren's cinematography captures it beautifully. It's also got two delightful lead performances; Gosling showcases some genuinely impressive piano skills while Stone delivers a wide range of abilities and both of them display an adeptness at their song and dance routines.\n\nCredit where it's due, Chazelle has successfully brought the musical into the modern era with this, unashamedly, nostalgic piece. It's a charming film but not one that excited or entertained me as much it has others. Those that enjoy romantic or musical films will find much more to embrace here and will, undoubtedly, rank it higher than I have. I can't argue with that and I can't say it's a bad film. I appreciated it for what is but musicals in general don't really have me singing from the rooftops.\n\nMark Walker",

It has something to do with the profound disagreement I have with them based on my opinion that there are way better ways to display the surrealism of a mundane or any for that matter situation than a ridiculous dance off - you know like the pointless one at the start of movie. Where it shines for me is when it uses music and dance to show subtle and nonchalant emotions and not something stupendously grandiouse. And except the already mentioned rocky start La la land is exactly that. It takes a basic story - the pursuit of passion and proceeds to add depth to it trough music. Actors performances, music and scene composition are beautiful and combined with it's grounded story it's a movie that is closer to an expirience than anything else. So is it worth an Oscar? Well it's the first musical I've finished so that's worth something.",

The stunning introduction perfectly sets the mood of the story and introduces us to the Los Angeles setting.  This scene is easily my second favorite tracking shot of all time (next to \"Atonement\").  The film pays tribute to classic musicals of the 40's with its lengthy single-take dance sequences like the six-minute tap scene as they search for Stone's Prius.  As the film progresses, each scene is more ambitious than the last and the execution is consistently perfect.  Dancing among the stars in the planetarium, moving in regular motion among bodies in slow motion, an entire scene fading to black as a spotlight illuminates one character in the center of it - you can't even measure the production value of this well-conceived tribute to the Hollywood musical.  Though a lot of stylized films miss the mark, this one hits the bullseye.  I often grow frustrated with modern movie musicals whose songs are forgotten before even walking out of the theater.  Days after seeing this film, I can clearly recall Justin Hurwitz's simple musical themes that stick with you far beyond the closing credits.   \"La La Land\" is a true musical triumph, and the genre of choice is jazz.  Much like in 2014's \"Whiplash,\" director Damien Chazelle has found a way to make jazz accessible to modern audiences.  Ryan Gosling's monologue about jazz pinpoints the experience of hearing it live and reflects the passion of true jazz fans; meanwhile the jazz-infused musical theater songs keep the thematic genre at the center of the film.  In a weak Oscar class, \"La La Land\" soars beyond the competition and is a shoe-in for Best Picture (unless the culturally relevant statements of \"Moonlight\" manage to steal it away).  While many of the technical aspects make the film shine, its heart lies in its believable characters.  Emma Stone delivers her most impassioned performance since \"Birdman\" with her phone audition and I believe that she has the Oscar in the bag.  Her singing has a soft, light quality that properly suits her character and her chemistry with Gosling drives the film from musical number to musical number.  I also appreciate that Gosling did all of his own piano playing for this film, which adds to the realism of his character.  The casting of John Legend was really clever in that it incorporated a pop culture icon who sings with excellent vocal technique.  I believe that the screenplay will win an Oscar, though I would have enjoyed a little more humor.  I can also see it winning Oscars for Director, Cinematography, Film Editing, and Score.  My main complaint about the film is its ending, which reflects Hollywood ideals over what we would expect to happen.  I'm still worked up about it, though this emotional response is a testament to its effectiveness.  \"La La Land\" is the complete package.  It is destined to win several of the technical Oscar categories and is the only film that will leave me shocked if it does not win Best Picture.  If you haven't seen this one yet, you need to.

            "content": "Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone co-star in Damien Chazelle's written and directed film, LA LA Land. Stone is Mia, a barista that is auditioning at every chance she can hoping to make it big as an actress. Gosling is Sebastian, a musician with dreams of grandeur who hopes to own his own Jazz club. If this does not sum up La and the millions that live there not much else will. The film does not have much plot beyond the blooming romance between the two leads, and their aspirations to make it big.\n\nThere is no question that musicals do not come along as frequently as they used to and amazing ones such as West Side Story and Sound of Music are even more uncommon. It is quite clear that Hollywood is still clamoring for this genre to remain afloat and do well as nearly any musical made anymore is Oscar nominated and this one is no exception.  If there was any doubt from the trailers that LA LA Land was a musical, the film does not waste a second and it instantly opens up with a musical interlude of people singing and dancing as they sit in rush hour traffic. The two leads are seen and interact rudely, but it is clear they do not know each other. We soon learn that Emma Stone is a barista that is going through auditions and she is one of the countless others that hopes to become an actress. After a few songs and moments there is a shift to Gosling's character. He is a struggling pianist that has strong love and interest in Jazz and only wants to associate with those who share this feeling. He dreams of opening his own club to prove that Jazz is not a dying art form. He stands in his own way and despite his talent he finds himself only doing gigs he believes are beneath him. After his introduction, the two randomly encounter again, without much progress. Apparently, LA is not so big after all since only during a third encounter 30 minutes into the film do we get a character name and a budding romance.\n\nA great musical uses song to embellish the feelings of characters while simultaneously drives the plot forward in an artistic manor. This film fails to do this, as most of the songs seem as if they are placed to remind you that indeed this is a musical so let's insert a song here why not. None of the songs are particularly memorable and there is not much choreography aside from assuring that the two main characters move in unison. One of best scenes of the film is when a friend convinces Goslings character that that Jazz is dying. The reason for this is that those who love it are holding onto the traditional greats (Monk, Powell, Parker) and advancement of the great music must come from letting the music evolve and not cling to the traditional sound. His agreement to let himself go and become a successful sellout was an interesting comment. \n\nAs the film goes on, it becomes more clear that what LA LA Land is trying to accomplish more so than anything else is be a microcosm of the modern LA. Text must be used to tell and remind the audience the time of year and its season because it is always Sunny in LA. The beginning of the film is like a new comer to LA, as there is the glitz, glamour, bright and vivid colors, song, dance, and plenty of history to go around. Once the charm wears off, behind it all there are simply just people with normal jobs struggling and hoping it to make it big. Through this struggle there is always doubt and moments of despair. Under this limelight, I began to enjoy the film significantly.  If, however this was indeed the film's intent, then more commentary on the people only talking with each other to better their chances for success would be warranted. Indication that even great talent or hope does not lead to success would have been more welcome than the happy go lucky traditional ending. LA LA land seduces you into believing it is a great musical and although I was entertained, it is clearly not to the extent that movie critics and Hollywood itself was. \n\n-2.22.2017",

What brought the movie down? And all this thinking made me realise something. Damien Chazelle is an artist. No ordinary artist, he's categorised into the ever-lasting genius section. The movie kept me captivated all throughout, so there was no time to check my phone. To be honest, I didn't even realise that I needed to urgently pee until after the movie. The whole choreography of the movie had me utterly speechless. Chazelle's use of one-takes (long shots) are impeccable. You see, long shots are usually boring (for example, watch Birdman, the movie that's infamously known to have no jump cuts), but in every scene there was just something interesting happening, whether it be in the background, or just the facial expressions of the extremely talented Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. I applaud both the stars on their dedication to learn such difficult parts and making the characters simply flow on screen. Gosling had to learn piano and the style of waltz while Stone's on screen appearance makes any movie worth the watch. The musical numbers were beautiful and unique, each too beautiful to forget. I'm humming the songs as I'm writing this! Hats off to Justin Hurwitz for the wondrous soundtrack. For me, however, what makes a movie is the way the story is told, and La La Land is like no other when it comes to this. If you strip the whole movie down, it's a simple boy-meets-girl love story. But once you add the lighting, music, dancing, special effects etc. you're caught up in this world of make-believe that you, oh so wish was real. It leaves you with a goofy feeling in your heart that maybe everything will be okay one day. You start singing like Mia (Emma Stone), and dancing like Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), which made me mad, of course, as I'm good at neither. And so, zooming in to me as I'm walking home, I realised that there was nothing missing from this movie. It left me mesmerised, yet mad. How can a movie be so great? It can be, and La La Land is.",

            "content": "La La Land is one of best reviewed, most lauded, and most loved movies of 2016. It has already won several awards and is very likely to win more. It received 14 Oscar nominations, tying the record set by All About Eve (1950), though All About Eve's 14 nominations was done with fewer categories, which seems slightly more impressive. La La Land is the front runner to take home the Best Picture Oscar. Let's get one thing straight: I like La La Land. I might even really like it, but I did not love it, at least not the way everyone else did.\u00a0\n\nThe plot is simple enough: Struggling jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) meets and falls for aspiring actress Mia (Emma Stone). Together they sing and dance through some of the loveliest scenes of Los Angeles on film. This is a side of L.A. not often seen movies. The center of American filmmaking is most often the setting of action and crime movies or it is meant to be a nonintrusive background. In La La Land, Los Angeles is stylized and romanticized. It is a city of purple sunsets, cool, blue nights, and hills and canyons and highways for song and dance numbers. I would not say that Los Angeles is a character because sets aren't characters, but it is at the forefront of La La Land. \n\nIt's no surprise that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have good chemistry; this is their third movie together after all. Each does a fine job in their respective roles. They sing and dance well enough, though they sing and dance like nonprofessionals that have been taught specific, not too challenging choreography. Each has a signature song: Sebastian has the melancholy \"City of Stars\" and Mia's \"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)\" serves as the film's climax. Both songs have been nominated for the Original Song Oscar.\n\n\nLa La Land takes place in a daydream world and writer-director Damien Chazelle seeks to transport the audience to this wonderful musical world. He succeeds, to a point. La La Land is meant to be a loving, enthusiastic tribute to the musicals of the 1950's and 40's. The misstep it makes is this: instead of taking inspiration from the great musicals of the past to create a new, fresh take, it simply lifts from and imitates those films instead. Action and science fiction are the genres most often criticized for being derivative, but musicals can be derivative too. There are numerous visual references to other musicals (enough for a side by side video comparison). Some are indirect: the bold, bright color pallet of costumes and sets is reminiscent of the musicals of Jacques Demy. Others are more direct: Gosling jumps up on a lamppost just like Gene Kelly in Singin' in the Rain. Unfortunately, since I've already seen most of the movies La La Land references (Jacques Demy's Umbrellas of Cherourg, Young Girls of Rochefort; Fred Astaire musicals: Shall We Dance, The Band Wagon, Funny Face; and, most of all, Singin' in the Rain, An American in Paris, and every other Gene Kelly musical), subtly and not so subtly, it comes off less as a tribute and more as a hollow imitation.\n\nThere's a lot to like in La La Land. It's a nice story about aspiring performers falling in love and trying to achieve their dreams. From the pink and purple sunsets to Stone's bright, yellow dress, La La Land is filled with bold and vibrant solid colors that cannot help but catch the eye. The songs are pleasant and enjoyable, even if you don't like jazz (and I don't). Some of the musicals numbers are very visually appealing-I'm thinking of Sebastian and Mia's dance at the observatory specifically-but others never open up to be as grand as I was expecting. The opening number plays like generic tableau of what someone that hasn't seen a musical thinks a musical is like. I suppose I just can't help but be reminded of the classic musicals with undeniably better performers and songs and wonder why I'm not just watching one of those again. I didn't get the feeling of unabashed joy and love and wonder that I get whenever I watch Truffaut's Day For Night, Gene Kelly's Singin' in the Rain, or even Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous (all about performers in the entertainment business). But still, I enjoyed this movie.",

But what made for a great opening sequence was quickly followed up with great direction around a very cliched filled script that was telegraphed the moment we saw the coffee shop scene in the first act. I didn't care about the main characters falling in love, I didn't care about the songs they sang, and I didn't care where they ended up at all. I didn't cry at the last montage sequence before the end and I just saw massive flaws of logic in character developments. This again is a film where Hollywood celebrates itself even tho no one actually cares about films these days (especially because of Netflix). This being a fantasy film about love really plays up the fantasy when they're \"filming a big movie on the Warner Bros. lot.\" The fantasy here is they're filming something in LA, where we all know they move to Vancouver or Toronto to shoot everything these days.

Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling were top notch and carried this movie through to the end. The music was so good I even created a playlist to revisit it again and again (I mean it's jazz, so good). I was in awe of the cinematography but this is much to be expected from Damien Chazelle as his previous works are all cinematography masterpieces. \r\n\nThis leads us to the story\u0085 I found it hard to put into words exactly why the story was so lacking and disjointed from how great everything else about the movie was. I have been reading both the highest praises and lowest blows given to this movie and none of them mention the story or more importantly the relationship between Emma Stone's Mia and Ryan Gosling's Sebastian. The setup is great, struggling actress meets struggling artist over and over and they seemingly fall in love. Only their career aspirations and dreams of the future pull them apart. Tragic right? Well, the tragic moments seem to be \runending and this is where the story jumps the rails. While their love seemed real there is a fatal turning point where Emma basically squashing Ryan's dream and encourages him to go against his own desires (The only motivation for this moment appears to be to move the plot along, it felt so disingenuous to the characters). When Emma is presented with Ryan's feelings she flip-flops and blames Ryan\u0085 All the while Ryan's love for Emma keeps him pushing Emma to achieve her dream to which she was all too willing to give up on. This all seems very anti-woman, it portrays them both as having weak character but it shades Emma's character as the weaker of the two. Even in the end, it hits her when she is already down. As if the audience didn't already think this movie was a tragedy it doubles down. Not only could they have the career aspirations they both sought so highly after, enough to disregard the love they had for each other, but if they just would have stuck it out it would have ended in beautiful bliss by giving them their hard earned cake and letting them eat it too. The tragedy already portrayed before the ending of the film was enough for this 'reveal' at the ending to not move me at all. I was happy to see the credits so I could go download the soundtrack and move on.",

Welcome to \"La La Land\" - the land where a superfluously Hollywood-driven, self-indulgent musical nostalgically meanders over 120+ minutes en route to its Best Picture nomination which, if it wins, I predict will be this generation's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" or \"Gigi.\"",

Both of these roles are played very well, and the stars have great chemistry.\n\nThis movie is essentially a tribute to a bygone era. It is in the style of the movie musicals of the thirties and forties, with similar music, choreography, and a similarly upbeat story. There is a clear love for the movies and music of old on display here. It is evident that the writer and director is passionate about these things, especially since his last film, Whiplash, is also about jazz.\n\nThe musical numbers are very well done, with well written dialogue and excellent choreography. There is also a very heartwarming love story to go along with these performances. The tone of the movie is very happy and colorful throughout.\n\nI am not putting as much effort into this review as many of my others, since you've probably already heard a lot about it, considering it has swept the Oscar nominations. But I'm just going to write that it is a fun, uplifting film with heart. If you want to feel good at the movie, I recommend this one.\n\nJaythemovieguy.blogspot.com",

Going into this movie I thought it would be a little cheesy but after I was blown away of how awesome this movie is. The acting especially by Ryan gosling blew me away and how he uses the character he was given and makes it iconic. Emma stone s acting was good but not as good as Ryan's, her singing was way better but her acting isn't as iconic. And I like how this movie has the main characters going through real life scenarios and how real this can be in the real world. How this movie impacts one is unbelievable and people that are going through the same thing that these characters are going through, struggles and prevailing through life's. And the moral of if you are passionate about something you should do it, it may be hard but with hard work you can do whatever your heart desires.

The musical element is inspired, and does well not to overwhelm the movie, whilst the somewhat retro filter that seems to be across each shot works well. The soundtrack is great, as is the gradual conclusion of the movie. Inevitably going to divide opinions, although deservedly winning awards, and should be looked at for what it is - a romantic tale, and a very good one at that.",

But for all y'all who don't like those things, who think that \"musicals are unrealistic because people don't just randomly start singing and dancing, then you've never been to my house\"(quote from unknown).

Emma Stone destilando energ\u00eda y vulnerabilidad y Ryan Goslin tranquilo, calmado, lleno de pasi\u00f3n.

What really pulls you into this movie are the colors, music, dance and inspiration from similar films in the 50?s.

I was never bored or wondering how much of the film was left. By the end of the film when Mia and Sebastian see each other for the last time and the movie drives through an alternate world where the two end up together and both have their dreams all while still having each other, you also feel the heartache and conflict that the characters feel.

There is something wonderful about seeing this tone and style recreated for a modern film. Cynicism and pretentiousness are completely absent from this film, and nostalgia and joy take their place. Anyway, I guess that's what cinemas are made for... ;-)",

Could a movie be a homage to this almost forgotten era of the musical yet still hold enough originality to be taken seriously on its own merit?\nThe answers to these questions is, on the whole, an emphatic yes!\nThis movie written and directed by Academy Award nominee Damien Chazelle, (of Whiplash fame), tells the story of Mia, an aspiring actress (played by Emma Stone) and Seb, a jazz musician (played by Ryan Gosling) and their struggles with their art, love and life in the City of Angels.\nThe movie is played out in \"old school\" musical style for the most part, resembling an old Gene Kelly movie, with infectious tunes and fantastic choreography added to the colourful backdrop that is L.A.\nStone and Gosling are excellent too in their respective roles with their on screen chemistry is electric and both well deserved their Oscar nominations for their roles in this film.\nOverall, for the colour, music, dance and drama on show this is highly entertaining escapism at its finest which the Academy will surety reward significantly come Oscar night!",

I especially appreciated the cinematography with the primary colour pallet and the blurry spinning/montages make you feel like you were truly in a dream.  Although this is a \"musical\" many of the numbers seemed like you were watching a set with staged singing and dancing (similar to Glee) rather than spontaneous real life singing. Epilogue and Planetarium were so perfectly orchestrated that they seemed as if someone was dreaming them perfectly, compared to Another Day of Sun or City of Stars with the more classic spontaneous songs and choreographed dances.

The story might be sub par, but the filmmaking/cinematography has got to be some of the best Hollywood has seen in this genre for a while. You notice every color on the screen at once; they are all so vibrant and go together so well, especially in the scene with Mia and her roommates getting ready for a huge party. Not only the colors, but the camera angles are superb. In many movies, you are left wishing you could see a close-up at one specific point or a different point of view during an emotional scene, but the filming and editing of La La Land captures all of the important emotion its audience needs. Overall, although lacking in its storyline, La La Land leaves its viewers in awe for reasons beyond the romance Stone and Gosling portray in the film.",

Sloppy dancing, poor continuity, heavily edited vocals, and let's not forget the stains on the plot. For starters, is everybody really going to gloss over the fact that Mia was fully prepared to cheat on her boyfriend, Greg? She'd been seeing this poor guy for a month, AND he'd invited her to dinner with his brother (a dinner that she \"forgot\" about), so he clearly was trying to get serious with her. Maybe it would've been easier to watch if the movie portrayed him as a jerk, but he was a really nice and understanding character for the ten seconds that we saw him. And what does Mia do? Bails on him the second that she hears that awful song playing over the speakers of the restaurant. Doesn't even give him an explanation, just says 'I'm sorry' and runs out smiling from ear to ear. Seriously Mia? Did you have to be a jerk about it? Don't you owe poor Greg enough to at least TELL him that you're going to go hang out with Ryan Gosling instead of him? Goodness gracious, what a dirtbag. \nNext we've got Keith. Who is he? Nobody knows until a little past the halfway mark in the film. We don't know who he is, but we sure do see him. Summer montage, as Mia and Ryan Gosling (can't even remember his character's name...it's like he wasn't even playing a character, he was just playing Ryan Gosling for 2 hours. He got a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination for literally just being himself.) were frolicking around 'falling in love' and doing cliche things like kissing on trains and walking down the street together (where were they walking to? why were on they on a train? nobody knows, because there was cliche jazz music playing the whole time, like they've got to shove in our face every six minutes that HEY THIS IS A JAZZ MUSICAL IN CASE YOU DIDNT GET IT DID YOU GET IT IT'S JAZZ I'M SO ORIGINAL GAHHH. Anyway, so during this summer montage, they show a five second clip and Mia and Ryan meeting John Legend and his fiance as they show them their engagement rings, so I'm sitting there thinking 'how does Mia and Ryan randomly know John Legend?' and then BOOM! He comes back 10 minutes later as some guy named Keith who is complete strangers to Mia, even though she JUST SAW HIM AND HIS FIANCE. And then Mr. Keith / John Legend looks at Ryan and is like 'I haven't seen you in years' EVEN THOUGH THEY JUST SAW EACH OTHER THAT SUMMER. What...even...did this film not have editors...did nobody question this...what... \nAnd let's not forget about the total Birdman move Damien Chazelle tried to pull, doing the whole \"take this scene in one take\" thing. Here's the thing though: you can't just do that whenever you want. You can't pick out random scenes throughout the movie to do in one take, and then do normal film cuts for the rest of the movie. Birdman was taken in one complete take; that's why it was phenomenal. You have to have continuity in your film shots, but clearly Damien Chazelle threw that out the window.  He should'nt have switched back and forth for the shots, he should've just stuck with one and gone with it. If he had, I would have a lot more hair on my head. \nFor some clarification, I don't hate Damien Chazelle (Whiplash is one of my favorite movies) I just don't like this movie. Maybe it's because there's so many mistakes with it that everybody's overlooking, maybe because it's overhyped, but this movie just makes me so angry. It had so much potential that got thrown in the garbage because of poor script editing, film cuts, music choices (most of their songs used the same cliche chord progressions and motifs of most amateur Broadway productions, not the good ones) and casting. If you're making a musical, you need actors who can sing and dance. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are both talented actors, and Ryan Gosling is a talented musician (when he's singing out of his throat like in Blue Valentine, not when he's singing out of his nose), but this movie would've been 10x better if it had better casting choices. I mean come on, JK Simmons was in here and he had 3 minutes of screen time. Why would you waste JK Simmons in an insignificant role when you could've literally picked anybody off the streets of LA and gotten them to do it? JK Simmons is too talented to be given such an insignificant role. \nI know I've got a ton more to write, but I don't know if there's a word limit on these sort of things...",

The film managed to get around the fact that she is such a horrible human being and that is why most people just did not see that and she basically ruined his life when you thoroughly think about it.

The actors didn't have much to work with for the characters as I said they were underdeveloped and you feel like you don't really know them by the end of the film. Also, I think there was an error on the casting as the actors seem to be just that, actors, not singers and their voices lacked power when it came to the songs. The story itself is very forgettable and boring and focuses too much on the couple when they shouldn't be the centre of the story, it isn't a love story it is a film about much more they could have been a couple or just friends and it wouldn't matter to the story; but I guess romance always attracts the audience right? \n\nI will admit though that visually it was very nice and it had great cinematography, there were some interesting camera movements and the clothes and colour palette was very nice and well chosen in my opinion. \n\nOverall I didn't like it as much, but I guess it is good to watch to know what all the fuzz is about.",

With a big visual spectacle throughout reminiscent of the theatre. \n\nWhilst the visual style holds up it's end of the bargain the story behind la la land to me felt lack lustre. I think the film writers where trying to hard to make la la land stand out with all these things crammed into it. As a result the thing that faultless is the complex story that by now is done so much it was predictable and frankly un satisfying. \n\nThe first act this movie was the best part. It had all the tropes of a classic musical involved. Music numbers stole the show and the actors gave it their all. However when the secound act came around that all took a back seat for a angsty what felt like teen drama and it just didn't work. \n\nWhat really stood out for me was the cinematography. The camera angles and tracking shots where breathtaking and seemed endless. The visual style of some of the 'dream sequences' really stole the show for me. And are the main reason this review isn't lower. \n\nTo me la la land came off as oscar bate. I can see why it would be nominated for some awards at the academy but the story in my opinion really hinders it. Cheers",

            "content": "My critic quote: La La Land is all love and music wrapped into one artistic film.\n\nWhat I loved: 1. The colors and lighting - Mia and her roommates' dresses red-blue-yellow-green combination sold me onto the movie from the start. Mia's blue dress against the red glow of the Lipton Bar when she meets Seb is such a wonderful shot. In fact, all of Mia's dresses are fantastic in their own way; I don't remember a scene without her wearing one! In the dream sequence towards the end, the white with the 2D drawings was a really unique choice to match the characters. A few moments later, the black/white contrast of Mia and Seb's outfits keeps the movie holding on to its \"classical\" roots. \n2. The piano - The music of the film is very memorable and emotional. \"City of Stars\" and the number that entrances Mia into the bar for the first time were my favorite pieces. Ryan Gosling did a really good job learning piano so quickly; the hard work really shows!\n3. Emma Stone - Her conversations, her silly dancing, her smile and laugh, and her frustration with the auditions all included in this film made it wonderful. She has a natural charm!\n4. The stars - All throughout the film, stars are everywhere--in the making, in the sky, in the observatory, on the set-- living up to the song \"City of Stars\".\n5. The conflict - Mia and Seb struggle in achieving their dreams and keeping up a healthy relationship much like everyday people do. They faced lots of failure and frustration in the journey to their dreams. LIke Seb says about jazz, \"It's about conflict and compromise\": the road to the emerald city might not be without some obstacles. In their relationship argument, I felt like I had been there before: seeing the problems, responding to the issues in the same way. Both of these topics \n6. The ending - No spoilers!\n\nWhat was iffy: 1. John Legend - Don't get me wrong, John Legend makes great music but seeing him in the film made me think it was some kind of commercial. I couldn't take it super seriously.\n2. \"Jazz revival\" - After lots of thought, I've decided that if there were to be a movie about the heart and soul of jazz (similar to the attraction Seb feels for it), the main character would most likely be black, since African-Americans blended the genre into the music we love today. But, it's good that others are inspired by the music as well.\n3. The camera swoops - The camera spinning slowly and quickly and the swooping back and forth on two different areas of the set really hurt my eyes. I had flashbacks to the Hunger Games when Katniss and Clove fight at the cornucopia-- just the camera rolling and shaking all over.\n4. Seb's name - I only realized what Ryan Gosling's character's name was once Mia shows him the design for the club. This seems to be a common theme in new movies, since I found myself struggling with names while watching Rogue One, The Crown, and Fantastic Beasts.\n5. Length - The 2h30min was a long time for me to sit comfortably in my chair. In my opinion, it could have been whittled down to 2 hours.",

It is in fact, following the same old, but perfect Hollywood formula, almost to point of sucking up to it. But if this movie is so painfully repetitive, how does Damien Chazelle manages to take our senses and feelings into such a warm and joyful ride? La La Land may be one of the most cliched movies you will ever see, but that does not take away how magical, passionate, and immersive it manages to be.\n\nThere are doubts about La La Land's contribution as a story, but there is definitely nothing to doubt about the brilliant acting of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. There is a beautiful chemistry that happens between these two main characters. Emma Stone shows us a side of her we did not know, she shows us the great actress we have always known she could be. And in those few moments, where she is able to go all out as an actress, she leaves us speechless.\n\nThe music is not just good, it is beautiful. What more can you expect from Justin Hurwitz, the mind behind the score of Whiplash? Key moments in the film are unforgettable thanks to the music score. This, along the production and costume design, set the heartwarming and magical tone of the movie, all through its devastating yet hopeful ending.\n\nThinking back on the film, it is impossible to understand how anyone can be so engrossed by a story like this, including myself. Luckily, there is so much more to a film than the story. Acting, cinematography, costume and production design, and music are just some of the main areas where Damien Chazelle manages to bring out this musical to the surface, captivating everyone's attention, and making you forget about the fact that you've already seen this Hollywood story a thousand times.",

            "content": "First of all, the movie was a spectacular experience in the theater; it's one of those films released these days that is best to experience with a captive audience. The music and choreography is also top-notch. Though it takes a while to get going, the flick's messages of fantasy versus reality and the significance of movies and music (in this case jazz) really ring true. Whereas Ryan Gosling's performance was fine and acceptable (though not too far outside his wheelhouse), I thought the real showstopper was Emma Stone, who really got to imbue her character with strength and poise through all of the ups and downs of her quest. While the pair plays off each other nicely with their sarcastic barbs volleyed to-and-fro, the romance seemed a little one-sided to me (where Mia was more in love with Sebastian than he was with her). For me, because the character she portrayed was more relatable than Gosling's, her character's story was a lot more engrossing to see than his. Unfortunately, the film's greatest weakness (and what holds it back from being an outstanding movie overall) is its failure to commit to, and in some cases contradicting, its themes. During much of the film, the idea of reaching your dreams by building something new instead of succumbing to the easy way out, but certain occurrences in the story feel like they are counteracting against this idea. In addition, the HUGE Sequence - I won't go any further into it to avoid spoiling it here - ends up undermining the the events [that wrap up the story with a bow] themselves AND their intent, in my opinion. In conclusion, this shortcoming keeps it from being one of the top movies of 2016 for me; still, I almost thoroughly enjoyed the film while I was watching it.",

And frankly, I just don't get what the hype was all about.\n\nThe story is a somewhat muddled tale of a struggling actress and a jazz musician who fall in love, though they struggle to keep things together as they chase their dreams. Now, a plain story like this can usually be dressed up in a musical with flashy singing and dancing - neither of which are present here. The songs are repetitive, as it turns out that listening to the exact same chord progression repeated for two hours can become a bit tedious; and Stone and Gosling's \"singing-in-the-shower\" warbles certainly didn't dazzle this viewer. In fact, their restrained musical performances are an embarassment to the resplendant costumes and sets that surround them.\n\nWhat's worst, however, is that its potential did shine through. There are two or three dramatic scenes between Stone and Gosling that are so well written and brilliantly acted, they genuinely show up the mediocrity of the rest. It's not a bad film, by any standards, just very painfully and shamefully average.\n\nFinally, I watch enough Strictly Come Dancing to be irked by the poor shaping of Emma Stone's hands during her final musical number with Ryan Gosling. But that's being quite picky, isn't it?",

La La Land is a modern day musical love story of two people pursuing their dreams in Hollywood. Emma Stone plays Mia Dolan, an aspiring actress attempting to fulfill her passion while working as a barista on a studio lot & making the grinding rounds of casting calls. Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling), is a struggling jazz pianist  looking to fulfill his dream to open his own old-school jazz club, only to find himself playing popular music in clubs, at dinner parties & a variety of other paying gigs. When Mia & Sebastian fall for each other, the young couple's fairy tale romance is tested by the harsher aspects of the struggles to achieve their individual goals. La La Land is written & directed by Damien Chazelle, the acclaimed filmmaker behind Whiplash (my best film of 2014.)  Chazelle has made a magical, enchanting film story with stunning costumes & set pieces & engaging characters throughout the film reminiscent of the old-time Hollywood musicals. The musical numbers were exciting & boldly whimsical with each smooth transition from one number to the next. The performances from Emma Stone & Ryan Gosling were excellent & both of them have that classic Hollywood actor style. The winner of seven Golden Globe Awards, La La Land has been nominated for 14 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director & Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress (Emma Stone), & Best Actor (Ryan Gosling. If you enjoy watching old-school musicals (1930's, 40's & 50's) then La La Land is a movie musical worth seeing.",

It's way too long and unevenful, both hours dragged on forever and no one did anything. It was vomit inducing, starting with the very first scene with people singing and leaping off cars in traffic and then ending with a scene that I can only assume is tragically sad to viewers who like unrealistic happy endings. Definitely a movie for unrealistic dreamers, mainstream moviegoers, and the hopeless romantics. This movie wants to be a classic musical/love story about people trying to make it in hollywood. Unfortunately it comes out looking more like an unrehearsed highschool play.\n\nIt could have been a good, relatable movie if only they changed everything about it, added a plot, and took out the singing and dancing. Ryan doesn't come off as a jazz musician at all and Emma, unbelievably so, couldn't pull off a role about an actress. They both can't sing and their strange dance together was cringeworthy. This was like watching people with no chemistry read a script for the first time, each scene is just more tense, stiff acting that is unbearable to watch. They both aren't graceful enough for the dance scenes. It looked mechanical and forced. Ryans charm and comedic style tries to bleed through occasionally but it's held back by the lifeless character he has to play.\n\nEven Emma seems to be holding back. The chemistry between them never happens which didn't make the ending sad like the movie intended with a ridiculous fantasy scene showing what could've been if they stayed together. The actors aren't completely to blame though, they were doing their best with what they were given. The writing is to blame. Without a plot and good writers even the best actors will look awful. The writing is the foundation of a movie and without that, you just have, well, la la land. A nauseating, pointless, plotless, terribly choreographed mess.",

The dance numbers seem to be an attempt at a homage to Astaire and  Ginger Rogers in retarded motion, but they are so badly staged and wanly choreographed that after a while they just become annoying. \n\nOne particular Gosling~Stone duet set in the L.A. Planetarium is so ridiculous --  with the two traipsing in  defiance of the Law of Gravity on thin air against a galaxy of stars --  that it is downright embarrassing.                              \n\nThe young lovers are clearly meant for. each other but their divergent career dreams and aspirations -- she as  an actress he as a Charley Parker inspired serious jazz musician -- keep them apart in the wake of arbitrary  script  manipulations that seem so phony you get the feeling the actors had to keep asking themselves, \"Hold  on a  sec --what were we supposed to be doing in that last scene?\" \n\nPathetic scripting, pathetic unmotivated dance scenes arbitrarily inserted, then ineptly executed -- pathetic  unfocused direction - no wonder Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) wear such strained expressions on their  pretty faces all the time. I actually felt sorry for Emma in some scenes suspecting that she may actually have been physically ill while going through some of her motions.\n\n I kept looking at my watch wondering if this thing was ever going to end. The running time was 128 minutes  but it felt more like  five hours. The end credits with handsome art-deco lettering\n\nwere a great relief when they  finally came up and put this picture  out if its misery. No more Damien Chazelle for me. He also directed  another piece of masochistic misery entitled\"Whiplash\". Give me\n\nMondo Cane ... \n\nBottom line: A film almost as dopey as its dumbbell La-dee-da title.  And if it cleaned up at the Golden Globes it only means that maintaining membership in the Hollywood Foreign Press Club by holding the right opinions  Is more important than having an understanding  of what the quality of film is all about. Ditto for the dopes (dupes) who at the academy have annointed this mediocrity with countless obsequious accolades and Oscar nominations.",

As with \"Arrival\" I saw this movie because of it's high rating on the Tomatometer and very positive word of mouth.  However I left the movie theater extremely disappointed.  Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are great actors.  I still say Stone should have won the Oscar for \"Birdman\".  However the two have no chemistry at all on screen.  I just did not buy them as a couple.  The movie also suffers from a painful lack of originality.  The script was loaded with old cliches and a plot we have seen before.  Ryan Gosling's character decided to open a jazz club after being inspired by Emma Stone's character.  The writers of this movie have obviously seem the 1980 cult classic \"Xanadu\".  Thoguth they love one another they ultimately don't live happily ever after but have a lasting impact their lives.  The writers have also seen \"Lost in Translation\" and the Academy Award winning classic \"An American in Paris\".  \"La La Land\" is a huge disappointment.  What's even more disappointing is the strong possibility the movie will sweep the Oscars.",

            "content": "In a world where people worship everything and value nothing, I have found that I value the many messages present within La La Land (2016). While simultaneously shining a harsh light on the hypocrisy of Hollywood and showing how our dreams and passions move us to make tough life decisions, I found myself deeply moved by the narrative presented within this film, not only as a lover of movies but as a creative artist myself. This film is for the dreamers. It's for the people who never give up in pursuing what they want out of life. It's for those who have a talent screaming to be noticed by others.\n\nAside from literally being the best musical I've seen in nearly more than a decade (Chicago (2002) is the only recent one that comes to mind), what I found most impressive about this film is that it is only the second directed by Damien Chazelle. For those who may have missed it, his previous work, Whiplash (2014), was an extreme look at the commitment a musician will take just to be a part of something bigger. With this in mind, we find that Chazelle has a passion for music that is easily grasped through his use of expert cinematography.\n\nMuch like The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967), La La Land makes me feel like the world would be a much better place if people sang and danced at the drop of a hat (or stop of a car). But even with the almost cliche \"romantic comedy\" beginning, where La La Land differs from these films is the depth that it explores the relationships between two dreamers. While we always want our life partners to succeed in their dreams, it can be difficult to find a balance between somewhat contrasting goals.\n\nA must-see film for anyone who aspires to something greater in their life, I give La La Land 5.0 stars out of 5.",

And from its opening, shot in one take, show stopping scene where a gridlocked Los Angeles traffic jam bursts into a song and dance number, this musical pulls out all the stops.\n\nSet in modern day LA but with a retro vibe, LaLaLand follows the romance between two dreamers - Mia (Emma Stone) a wide eyed wannabe, scratching a living as barista in a film studio coffee shop who dreams of being a movie star, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a grouchy jazz purist who dreams of opening his own nightclub. The films follows them through the seasons as they meet, argue, flirt, fall in love, and face a growing conflict between chasing their dreams and settling into a relationship.\n\nDirector Damien Chazelle's follow up to his Oscar winning drama Whiplash, is a stylish, romantic and inventive tribute. Stone and (the irresistible looking) Gosling have wonderful chemistry and give effortless, elegant performances with stunning sing and dance numbers. Scenes are shot in a way that feel blissfully romantic and the transition from musical numbers to narrative is seamless.\n\nThis modern take on the classic Hollywood musical is a fabulous flight of cinematic fantasy. While this award contender is a movie about the movies, which Hollywood always adore and is sure to bag a lot of them, this love letter to Los Angeles, to romance and to big dreams is undoubtedly a triumph. One of the films of the year.",

Neither Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling are talented enough musically to carry this off. I'm not even talking about their ability to sing and dance which was slim, I'm talking about their musical energy. Their bodies seemed too relaxed when they sang or danced . Musicals need that energy that fills the bodies so much that you understand why the characters need to sing. They just seemed happy to know the steps. This musical also lacked, plot, interesting dialogue and humor . I understand what an homage is and this movie missed the mark .

            "content": "I will preface that I went into this movie expecting not to like it much, but being curious enough about it due to Emma Stone, who I love, about the great reviews it was getting, and most of all my wife wanted to see it.\n\nI liked the movie much more than I thought it would. I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 5 for what I feel was audience pandering done intentionally by the writer/director in order to sell more tickets, which ultimately hurts the movie.\n\nHonestly I don't even understand how he was able to spin this into a feel good movie at all, and maybe it's really not, because when you break the plot down, it's a SAD story, and capped off by a bit of lying and dishonesty.\n\nSo, Emma Stone is great, she's beautiful, she's a great actress who can be witty, funny, convey sadness well, and amazingly is a pretty good singer. She earned the roll, and plays it well.\n\nRyan Gosling however is another story. Ryan is a decent actor, one who for sure is where he is because of his looks. The only problem is he isn't a great singer. Unlike some people on here, I won't say he CAN'T sing. He can sing well enough that 99 percent of the viewers can, or even notice.\n\nBut for a singer or musician, of which I'm both, when I saw the movie, I couldn't help but snap back out of the trance where you forget you're watching a movie and thinking, \"God he doesn't belong in a musical\".\n\nAnd there's the rub, then I realized, this isn't an accident, a miscast. If it was I'd probably give it a 4.5 stars. They already have John Legend on cast, who is a phenomenally better singer, AND whose acting skills don't seem to be much worse than Gosling anyway. \n\nBeing that movie studios are experts in acting, singing, and dancing talent this leaves you with one or two possible reasons for casting Gosling as Seb instead of Legend. That's either that the studio figured thereally was upside to using Gosling's name to attract women to the film based on his looks knowing the majority of then wouldn't notice the singing,  OR that the studio dealt that even though Legend would better be suited in the lead rolr, the biracial couple thing in combinatiom with lack of Goslings name would hurt sales.\n\nRegardless I view it as an intentional act with knowledge it was making the product worse from the get go. People can be cast thinking they can pull the acting off.\n\nIt's evident within the first few words of somebody singing whether or not they can sing. You can't miscast his voice.\n\nPlot spoilers after this point, stop reading if you haven't seen it.\n\nThis movie is painted as a love story, and they pull it off by focusing heavily on that aspect, focusing very little on the breakup brought on by Sebastian'a poor relationship choices, and show a very curious \"Dallas-esque\" dream sequence in which we are led to believe in 5 years time Mia met another man whom she never mentioned her former Jazz Pianist boyfriend to, who then dishonestly doesn't mention this relationship to her husband when they inadvertently walk in Seb's, and then she sits there and dreams of the life she wishes she had with Seb while they watch the show. \n\nMaybe they should do a sequel where she sneaks back to Seb's as her marriage fizzles and rekindles the marriage.\n\nThe plot of the movie could be summed up like this.\n\nJazz musician who should stick to playing piano instead of singing, meets cute girl with far better voice who learns to love Jazz due to him. He stupidly gives up on his dreams to play a type of music he doesn't even like because he thinks she wants him to have a steady job, finding out once he has signed a contract that she just wants him.\n\nThe twist of the knife is she ends up becoming a famous actress due only to him driving from LA to Nevada to tell her that she got a call back to his number, and could have then helped launch his club anyway.\n\nHe lost the love of his life for nothing, and she regrets it as well.",

(GRADE: A)\n\nFeaturing truly dazzling film-making and strong performances by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, La La Land is an enchanting blend of modern and retro. Taking place in present-day Los Angeles, but made in the style of classic Hollywood musicals, it's a delight. The leads are merely passable as vocalists, but strong as actors and dancers. Their undeniable chemistry, combined with the sensibilities of writer-director Damien Chazelle (who places one foot in bittersweet reality and the other in whimsical fantasy) make for an unforgettable cinematic experience. \n\nThe songs, choreography, wardrobe, production design, editing, and cinematography are top-shelf. It could use a bit tighter pacing and the ending may divide some audiences (I thought it was beautiful), but this unconventional love story is a must-see.\n\nIS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS?\n\nLa La Land is rated PG-13. It has one f-word and a few moderate profanities, along with two vulgar hand gestures. Swimsuits and dresses reveal legs, abdomens, and mild cleavage (frankly it's no more revealing than what's shown in old Gene Kelly movies if you go back and re-watch them). There's some drinking at Hollywood parties. Some couples dance sensually in the background, but it's not raunchy or explicit. A man and woman kiss and live together; we see them cuddling fully clothed in bed. There is no sexuality.\n\nANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES?\n\nBe grateful for the people who inspire you. Pursue your dreams with tenacity and integrity. The direction your life takes hinges on the decisions you make; choose wisely.

While it would be easy to dismiss this as your standard good-but-not-great, Oscar-bait-nostalgia film, La La Land is distinctly smarter and more nuanced than that. As it has to be, it is self-aware. But some self-aware films full face first into a pool of cynicism. La La Land is too smart for that. Damian Chantelle brilliantly keeps it from getting too cynical, even while it knows enough to gently question the tropes it dares to toy with. Gosling is exceptional as the lead, Stone also - though mostly 'playing Emma Stone'. JK Simmons has a sly cameo as the owner of a jazz club. Gosling doesn't quite play his tempo.\n\nLa La Land's fatal flaw is that it doesn't seem to quite know what to do to finish. I applaud the bravery of challenging the 'ride off into the sunset' finish, yet even as Emma Stone is considering her choices at the end of the film, there seems to be a shrug that everything is okay and we have all followed our dreams. La La Land's biggest problem is not its nostalgia, its pomp or its lack of realism, but its reinforcement of consumer, individualist culture. It seems to be the one thing Chantelle doesn't realise he's doing. \n\nStill - so far the best film I've seen this year, narrowly shading 'Arrival.'",

I know so many uber talented performers who could sing and dance circles around these two stars.  It's frustrating that producers don't give some of them a chance.  When movies are made of Broadway musicals they always have to cast a well-known star instead of the Broadway actor that made the show a success.  Disappointed.",

They meet each other at this party and kind of build up this relationship that they have now. I'm not going get into spoilers'.

I did not like Emma Stone, to me she was not even acting but pretty much telling us that she wants a Oscar me and I liked Gosling . He had a good performance. I loved him when he would talk about jazz to Mia (Emma Stone).  I didn't think Emma Stone's what is so terrible that it's unwatchable, but she felt like an interesting character. I extremely like when she explains film to Sebastian ( Ryan Gosling).  I also love that this film went back to the film history and used a CinemaScope, which projects on the screen a full scope of the film with tons of detail of the film.  This film does have it's fair share of problems. First off, the beginning 30 minutes are a drag to get through. I almost stopped watching the film. Also, there's a  song  in this film that felt, thrown in and it it didn't work with the whole film. As well as, in the beginning of the film there was a tracking shot of people dancing on freeway and felt you didn't need that in the film. It did nothing for driving the story forward with the two main characters. \n        The editing for this film is pretty good, but nothing special. The director of La La Land , Damien Chazelle puts his passion into this film but personally I prefer his Whiplash movie over his La La Land movie. Movies like La La land, are Oscar bait movies. These types of movies that come out at the end-of-the-year. Will usually get nominated tons of  awards. In 10 years, I  think this movie will be remembered , but not for its acting.\n\ngive La La Land 8/10",

They both got through the dance numbers but I was hoping to be wowed like with Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelley in Singing in the Rain.   Why didn't they cast real dancer/singers from a broadway musical and give them an opportunity to become stars from this movie?    The choreography was unimaginative - sorry Mandy - and dance recital-like.   Even the freeway scene could have used a more creative movement vocabulary.

Given its length there is not too much singing or dancing (good that there is not much singing, as what there is in NOT very good). So in summary it DOES NOT revive the glory days of musicals - nothing to compare with teh joy and the well-integrated plot lines, or the happy, happy endings of 7 Brides, King and I, the Great Singing in the Rain, or even West Side story, which could have been a good director/production/cut/filmography path for this film to have followed. \nI really did enjoy watching the two leads, but the film is too bitty, too time-dimension distorted and too lacking in soul and a happy ending [given its content] to be considered a great.

My main problem with musicals is: why? If a scene's not interesting enough to sustain momentum without having song and dance, then cut it! At least in animated films, they seem to find ways to weave songs in organically - and they're catchy. Here, I didn't find any of the songs very catchy or interesting - most are kind of mopey. Otherwise, it's all quite predictable - they fall in love, they chase their dreams, the end.\n\nThe ending is semi-interesting, but every time I started to get pulled into the film when there's a stretch with no singing, it suddenly appears again - always out of context - and pushes me back out. It's definitely not a bad film, I just felt like nothing really happened - sure, there's some romance and they're good actors, but there's no real story or humour to be found.",

Ah\u00ed maestr\u00eda es cuanto a la m\u00fasica que posee con la que uno simpatiza f\u00e1cilmente dando lugar a momentos de placer auditivo escuchando un estilo de m\u00fasica cl\u00e1sico pero bien hecho haci\u00e9ndolo sentir novedoso y deslumbrante para nuestra \u00e9poca y acompa\u00f1ado de las coreograf\u00edas que emplea, un dise\u00f1o de producci\u00f3n que la verdad terminan con avivar el esp\u00edritu y nos coloca en su \"mundo m\u00fasical\".\n\nLa direcci\u00f3n de Damien Chazelle es sorprendente y tanto su talento como su amor por el jazz se demuestran aqu\u00ed. Ya nos hab\u00eda dado prueba de eso en Whiplash, pero aqu\u00ed nos ofrece el una forma m\u00e1s armoniosa de situaciones para verlo. Si se le puede resaltar una cualidad que tiene este director fuera del resto, es que: Sabe como capturar una emoci\u00f3n. Esto de mano de la fotograf\u00eda que maneja la pel\u00edcula, hermosa y deslumbrante con un toque teatral que queda excelente en la pel\u00edcula con momentos en la historia que sale de contexto para hacer escenas art\u00edsticas que se vuelven \"poes\u00eda audiovisual\" en su gran esplendor. Y en su mejores momentos, cuando solo enfoca a un actor y acompa\u00f1ado de la m\u00fasica sentimos todo en \u00e9l, sus emociones, sus pensamientos, su asombro ante lo que est\u00e1n pasando... Un manejo de escena bien logrado, y varias veces. \n\nDe las actuaciones no hay nada que discutir, no ser\u00e1n de los m\u00e1s originales dada la trama pero eso no quita lo bien hechas que est\u00e1n. Ryan Gosling logra encajar en su papel, que representa a alguien apasionado por el jazz haci\u00e9ndonos deslumbrar por esta m\u00fasica y todo su mundo tanto como su personaje. Emma Stone encanta al p\u00fablico con peque\u00f1os detalles de ilusi\u00f3n y sue\u00f1os que vive y por mucho logra de los momentos m\u00e1s sentimentales de la pel\u00edcula, a veces con sola presencia o actuando con calidad art\u00edstica, tanto como Ryan Gosling.\n\nComo ya se recalco varias veces, esta pel\u00edcula VIVE de su banda sonora, un trabajo musical tan sorprendente como admirable al ofrecer canciones de jazz que afloran el esp\u00edritu de lo cl\u00e1sico. Esta sabe como emocionar a un p\u00fablico en los momentos emotivos donde esta va acorde con el sentimiento que expresa el actor y lo potencia. \n\nLa La Land cumple y con creces. Consolida a un joven director como uno de los nuevos talentos de Hollywood, ofrece una pel\u00edcula rom\u00e1ntica conmovedora, tiene una fotograf\u00eda que deslumbra y encanta. Pero sobre todo, da luz a un trabajo art\u00edstico que revive un g\u00e9nero tanto musical como cinematogr\u00e1fico y nos da una pel\u00edcula que no es simplemente \"un musical m\u00e1s\"\n\nLa La Land (2016) Calificaci\u00f3n: 9.5/10",

I was actually taken aback at how honest/down-to-earth the story was. \"Chicago\" and \"Moulin Rouge\" this ain't. The whimsical nature of traditional musicals is tossed aside in favor of a realistic, adult take on a story about struggling artists. It's only during the musical queue's where the film finds it's whimsy. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling aren't exactly powerhouses in the vocal department, but they can both sing well enough, which is all that's really required for a story like this one. However, I can honestly say that it wasn't until Emma Stone sings \"Fools who dream\" where the film actually affected me. It wasn't necessarily that I finally \"got\" the movie, it's when the movie got ME. That fire that once burned so brightly within (I was once an aspiring rock bassist) returned for a moment to remind me that all the trouble, mistakes and drama was worth it. This flick is a love letter to all the starving artists out there that wanna keep the fire ablaze despite being beaten down by rejection. The filmmaker is simply saying \"Don't fret, cuz this one's for you...\" Is this whole thing worth (a historic) 14 Oscar nods? I personally don't think so. It's profoundly moving though, and that's worth something.",

La La Land is like your prodigy son; you recognize his genius but you ask for more. You want him to exceed all expectations; shatter all preconceptions and tower above in a league of his own; because you love him. La La Land is like that; its glorious but you want it to be more glorious; romantic but you want it to be more romantic. Described by its director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, Grand Piano) as a \"modern musical\"; a modern musical is what it is. From the elaborate opening set piece which promises passion and color; to the twosome dance at the verge of the Los Angeles cityscape as promising as their dreams; Seb (Ryan Gosling) a Jazz pianist and Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress, seem to be at odds with each other; but their fate is sealed and we already know how it will end; but it's ok because we know that some dreams come true while others remain as beautiful dreams. The soundtrack in La La Land is haunting but is also alive; you can feel how the notes of each music piece are connected as if one long song evolving over the course of the film. If anything, this is what La La Land is about: evolution. How our dreams evolve, how music evolves and how musicals need to evolve from the classicals we've all come to love to something that better suits the needs of today's audiences.",

The movie may be heartbreakingly painful for some, but for some others, they'll get a sense of closure too. Dare to dream, is perhaps the best message this movie has to tell. & to Damien Chazelle, keep on daring.",

The film is adapted from a very well-written screenplay that really was made as a love letter to the old Hollywood films. This film is a musical that has great songs and really powerful music that will stick with the audience for many moments afterwards. There are some great performances in here, especially from Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Gosling gives a very straight forward performance and we always know what he wants.

For someone like me who is a little bit of all the above, I liked everything about the film except the writing and I did feel like it the film dragged on too long at the end. But as much as I wanted to hate this film going in and call out film snobs...I can't. The movie is a great effort and brings back a style of film Hollywood had long forgotten about. So for that I say, it deserves its praise. Now I'm not going to give it \"best film of the year\" nods while Hacksaw Ridge and Hell or High Water are in the running and I believe those are MUCH better films but La La Land is a fun blast from the past and if you can take anything away from it, stop being such prudes about Jazz music.",

This prompts Sebastian to explain to naive Mia all about the genre, and how it's dying by abandoning its roots. This, quite fittingly, comes from a film that stands as a rare completely original live-action musical, another genre that many would consider dead in this day and age.\n\nNot if Damien Chazelle has anything to say about it. In the same way Sebastian yearns for the jazz's days of old, Chazelle harkens back to the musicals of the 30s and 40s for this rousing jazz musical. Chazelle once again teams up with composer Justin Hurwitz, who scored Chazelle's previous two films, resulting in whimsical toe-tapping melodies that wouldn't be out of place in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Paired with the lyrics of theatre duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the soundtrack is chock full of earworm tunes that are sure to be immediately stuck in your head, ranging from more simple tunes to emotionally charged ballads. Chazelle himself shows a flair that you don't typically seem to find in directors of his age range, capturing the musical sequences with awe-inducing choreography and camerawork that truly captures the vast Cinemascope angles of old. From the vibrant prelude Another Day of Sun (captured in three unbelievable takes edited together to form one Birdman-esque shot) to the tearjerking Audition (The Fools Who Dream), there's not a single song here that isn't immediately impressive as both a composition and as a performance.\n\nIt might come to a shock for some that La La Land's lyrical soundtrack isn't all that robust, made up of just seven songs (including one performed twice, once as a solo and once as a duet). In a way, it's a bit disappointing, but it also allows for the underlying story to truly come forward and take the stage. It's interesting to think that this film actually shares a lot in common with Chazelle's Whiplash, in that they both cover the same themes of chasing dreams and the sacrifices that come with that. But whereas Whiplash was an angry, intensely passionate story, La La Land is much more romantic and calm. Chazelle has written Mia and Sebastian as two immediately empathetic characters, and the performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, and their electric chemistry, truly solidify the relationship: the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers comparison is truly valid. And it culminates in a truly impactful finale and epilogue, a kind of scene infused with passion that you just don't see anymore, and one that is sure to not leave a single dry eye in the house. As the film's tagline states, this is a film for the fools who dream, and for that, Chazelle deserves all the thanks for such a wondrous experience.",

This realization usually comes when a scene in the film reminds me of some other movie and I find myself longing to watch that film instead of the one I am desperately trying to enjoy. \n\nIn the case of La La Land, this didn't take too long.\n\nDuring the duo dance scenes between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I found myself longing to watch Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell. \n\nDuring the jazz music scenes, I found myself longing to put on some music from Miles Davis or Dave Brubeck. \n\nDamien Chazelle's souffl\u00e9-light screenplay made me long for some sort of story with substance. Let's face it; even your longest allowable tweet would carry as much storytelling weight as this script. \n\nWhen considering Chazelle's direction, I found myself longing for a musical directed by Vincent Minnelli. \n\nAnd while all this longing was going on, I was longing for a shorter film. La La Land is not a long production when compared with West Side Story or The Music Man (and let's not make any further comparisons with those great films) but, it sure as heck seemed like a long, long movie.\n\nDictionary.com defines the phrase \"la la land\" as \"a state of being out of touch with reality.\" I won't disagree with that definition. About halfway into this flick, I was beginning to drift off into Dictionary.com's interpretation.\n\nLuckily, I had some severe arthritis pain in my right big toe that kept me alert long enough to long for some relief; algesic or cinematic, and to keep me awake long enough so that I could make a valid critique of this picture. \n\nFinally, I long for the day when someone will make a musical that's even half as watchable as the last good Hollywood musical - Hairspray (which really wasn't all that long ago, was it?).",

            "content": "7/7 agli ultimi Golden Globe, Coppa Volpi per la migliore interpretazione femminile a Venezia per Emma Stone e 14 (!!) nomination agli Oscar (record all-time) sono il biglietto da visita di questo musical che porta la firma della nuova scuola hollywoodiana guidata dal genio di Damien Chazelle. La La Land \u00e8 un musical che rispetta e cita i grandi classici del genere senza rinunciare alla modernit\u00e0. Tecnicamente e musicalmente fenomenale. La trama ad un'occhiata fugace potr\u00e0 sembrare abbastanza banale e stereotipata (e non ci sarebbe niente da ridire in proposito) con i due protagonisti innamorati che cercano il loro posto nel mondo, ma \u00e8 proprio questo il fondamento di una storia che pone una, ed una sola domanda al suo pubblico: fino a che punto ci si pu\u00f2 spingere per i propri sogni? Che sia sfondare nel mondo del cinema cos\u00ec storicamente poco inclusivo o anche solo aprire un locale jazz per trasmettere un po' della propria passione, questo \u00e8 poco importante. La La Land colpisce nel segno praticamente subito grazie a dei piani sequenza cos\u00ec ben congeniali da risultare irreali, con canzoni orecchiabili e facilmente memorizzabili che ti fanno patteggiare per i due protagonisti e, perch\u00e9 no, sognare di essere al loro posto. Questa pellicola \u00e8 per sognatori, per chi vorrebbe cantare e ballare in mezzo alla strada, non curante del pensiero altrui almeno per una volta, come se si vivesse davvero all'interno di un musical. La visione di Chazelle potr\u00e0 risultare un po' buonista per i pi\u00f9 cinici ma lui non si accontenta (come anche in Whiplash) di descriverci il mondo come \u00e8, lui ci mostra come dovrebbe essere: con un amore sconfinato per il jazz, per la citt\u00e0 che ti stimola di mattina e che ti culla la notte, per la donna (o l'uomo) della tua vita, cos\u00ec vuota senza di lei/lui, sicuramente pi\u00f9 semplice ma anche meno eccitante, avvincente e delirante. La La Land \u00e8 tutto questo, \u00e8 colori (una fotografia d'autore come non si vedeva da tanti anni ci accompagna in questo viaggio per l'ignoto), \u00e8 musica (la colonna sonora di Justin Hurwitz ci fa emozionare), \u00e8 vita ricca di gioie e delusioni, di compromessi e sogni nel cassetto. La via pi\u00f9 facile potr\u00e0 anche essere mettere a tacere i propri desideri, ci spiegano i nostri protagonisti, reprimerli e sostituirli magari con qualcosa di pi\u00f9 convenzionale, di pi\u00f9 sicuro, ma se non hai mai rischiato almeno una volta nella vita allora, forse non hai mai vissuto; perch\u00e9 ci sar\u00e0 sempre chi cercher\u00e0 di farti a pezzi, chi ti dir\u00e0 che non dovevi nemmeno provarci ed \u00e8 proprio l\u00ec che La La Land ti lascia senza fiato, mostrandoti come non sia per niente facile mettersi in gioco in situazioni nuove e dicendoti, e questo vale da solo il prezzo del biglietto, che con un po' di perseveranza e, perch\u00e9 no, con la giusta persona accanto che ti prende per mano, si pu\u00f2 fare di tutto. Questa pellicola far\u00e0 la storia, ne sono certo ed \u00e8 principalmente grazie alle tre star di questo film: Damien Chazelle, Ryan Gosling ed Emma Stone. Il regista/sceneggiatore stravolge le regole del gioco usando i canoni tradizionali e si catapulta, gi\u00e0 al suo secondo film, nell'olimpo dei pi\u00f9 grandi; strizza l'occhio ai suoi predecessori ma sa come innovarsi e, alla fine della proiezione, ci bisbiglia nell'orecchio distrattamente che ancora non abbiamo visto niente di ci\u00f2 di cui lui \u00e8 realmente capace. Per quanto riguarda la premiata coppia Gosling&Stone c'\u00e8 poco da dire, una chimica difficilmente vista sul grande schermo che ci riporta alla mente le atmosfere di Casablanca; i due piccioncini infatti con i loro Sebastian e Mia si pongono come eredi spirituali dei vari Humphrey Bogart e Ingrid Bergman, ballando in simbiosi cos\u00ec bene dai tempi di Fred Astaire e Ginger Rogers dimostrandoci come l'amore sia il motore di tutto. La La Land vuole ricordarci quanto siano belli i sogni semi-dimenticati dei tempi andati, quei sogni fatti solo di facce, musica e movimento. Ha la testa tra le nuvole, e per poco pi\u00f9 di due ore, porta il pubblico lass\u00f9 con lui. Solo una parola: CAPOLAVORO.",

With their third feature together (Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad) the pair demonstrate why they may be our generation's Gene Kelly and Ginger Rogers--two actors that are paid homage to in this film.\n\nLa La Land is about a struggling actress, Mia (Stone), who is constantly being rejected at every audition she has, and a mercurial jazz pianist, Sebastian (Gosling), who dreams of opening his own jazz club. He is a talented musician but often finds himself going against his own integrity playing pop music and simple lounge standards. The two meet in a way that would make any classic cinephile proud, and over time develop a relationship, each dealing with his and her own floundering careers is the process.\n\nThe film acts as a love letter to Los Angeles. It's not necessarily a nice letter, but it's not a breakup letter either. More like a letter to an abusive partner who you keep coming back to for some inexplicable reason, only for them to spit on you and tell you you're worthless.\n\nIt pokes fun at the city, constantly saying out loud the things most of us would be tried for treason for ever thinking. But they've all been actual thoughts lingering in our minds at one point or another.\n\nIt's a quixotical view of what LA is supposed to be--or used to be. The two characters are old souls adamantly romanticizing what they view their ideal careers to be, only to realize that they view this city in an antiquated way that no longer really exists in today's world. Things such as technology and loss of nostalgia are ruining it, and they struggle to find the balance between the new and the old without wanting to compromise much.\n\nThe film, on the other hand, compromises the new and the old very well in its every moment. The songs don't feel modern, but they don't feel dated either. They're not necessarily poppy and affable at first--fitting well into the film's jazz theme.\n\nGosling and Stone are not fantastic singers, but they're not bad either, which makes their performances all the more appealing--they're one of us.\n\nMuch like a non-New Yorker can empathize with a film that pays homage (or lack thereof) to New York, one doesn't have to be from Los Angeles to get what the film is trying to say. Viewers can see where the movie comes from. LA is everywhere. We experience it in almost every movie we watch in one way or another.\n\nLa La Land isn't just for Los Angeleans. It's for dreamers and people with big visions. For people who have been rejected over and over and over again, told they're not good enough, and still, for some reason, keep going back at it. But like anything we love, it takes a lot of work. La La Land makes you believe in your dreams again.\n\nTwizard Rating: 100",

The cinematography, shot development and design are stunning. It's a great and honest look at the hardships of trying to follow (and keep) your passions in a city full of stars.

            "content": "There is so much to say about this movie musical, even without giving anything away. Just looking at my after notes, it's already loaded with comments and details telling me this is going to be a larger than normal post. (Possibly exceeding the IMDb word count of a thousand) let's see. \n\nDamien Chazelle does it again, firstly where he bashed my head in with a drumstick or two with 2014's Whiplash, which was so intense, it had me sweating in the cinema. Twice. I had to watch it again the very next day and wasn't any less sweaty the second time round. An absolute masterpiece. \n\nNow, Chazelle might be considered to be on the young side of being an accomplished director, La La Land being born during his senior year at Harvard University in 2010, along side friend and musical writer Justin Hurwitz, but with a smaller budget and compromising script demands, the idea was shelved, until, the successful Whiplash received such high acclaim, they got granted a budget 30 times larger than the previous, and freedom with their own script and screenplay. \n\nChazelle again, displays his absolutely, stunning, visual brilliance whilst tilting the hat to classic cinema and musicals like Casablanca, Funny Face and The Red Balloon. Having been to L.A. countless of times, I find it to be my less favourite of the American cities I've been to, but, Chazelle manages to add a glossy, vibrant veil over the top that's inspired me with a new appreciation for the city. I still find it incredible and slightly unbelievable, but in a good way, that he's managed to take a modern, bustling and dirty city and still make it feel retro and vintage using abstract cinematography, like creating its very own time zone altogether. He even opens using the original 20th Century Fox logo and the fade out focuses make you feel like you're watching a theatre play. \n\nThere's a long list of scenes that stay with you because of this style and of course, being a musical, Chazelle honours the classic musical methods with astonishing and exuberant long takes that makes your smile stretch from seat 1 to 20. The opening scene alone is a tremendous feat with epic cinematography and beautiful imagery. I could dissect the whole movie, recounting each joyful and pleasant scene by scene, but it's truly something that has to be marvelled at by seeing and not reading. \n\nThe story is about a turbulent romance between Seb, (Ryan Gosling), a confident, proud and passionate pianist those ambitions sits with having his very own jazz club; and Mia, (Emma Stone) a struggling, aspiring actress trying to make her way in the superficial Hollywood. The cars they drive is a sweet analogy of their characters in way, Seb driving a classic '82 Buick Riviera and Mia driving a Prius. It must be familiar ground for both, playing aspiring performing artists such as they are in real life. Apparently the auditioning scenes which are torturous, were drawn from both star's actually experiences in auditioning. \n\nThe chemistry between the two is as always, perfect. This being their third outing after Gangster Squad and Stupid Crazy Love. Gosling oozes a certain coolness but with quite the finazz of confident arrogance. Whilst Stone appears vulnerable, reserved and bashful but what's simmering is an audacious, creative and inspiring woman. It's so well balanced and enriched by both, you could be forgiven for forgetting John Legend is in the movie. \n\nChazelle and Hurwitz love of Jazz shines through just like it did with Whiplash, now I know I keep referencing Whiplash, but please note, these are two very different films, which make this all the more impressive. It's the similarities such as the music being very much a subject matter to both films. I'm no expert but I'm a lover of Jazz too, and this soundtrack itself is utterly amazing, infectious and makes the heart glow with instantly recognisable tracks like \"Someone In The Crowd\", \"City of Stars\" and \"A Lovely Night.\" Justin Hurwitz composes a mesmerising, enchanting musical that reminds me of sitting in Ronnie Scott's and has me weaving in and out of traffic whilst listening to the songs in the car. \n\nGosling and Stone perform the songs and dances excellently, displaying a gracefulness that would make any non-musical fan a lover and a dancer. The choreography is majestic throughout, especially the two scenes at Griffin Park/Observatory, the tap dancing in particular. Gosling actually learning to play the piano for his parts entirely says a lot about him as a star and as an actor, getting the emotion to come through. \n\nThe whole production is flawless and as I've said before, this zesty imagery is made up dazzling costume designs, great atmospheric sets and masterful use of lighting. The dresses Mia wears set against the plots she's on is just eye-candy and Seb's shoes! I want a pair of those shoes! \n\nHave you ever watched a film and thought it was a personally message to you, sent from the cosmos, whether it be a dig or a reminder. The conclusion certainly hit a few chords on my heartstrings, bringing a tear to my eye, it's the perfect ending to a glorious movie. It's only shame is not having enough song and dance, but it a good thing to leave wanting more, and the film already has a runtime of 128mins. \n\nAs always, I haven't read any reviews but from what I can gather from the quotable taglines they are awarding the film with, they're absolutely right, it really is what everyone is saying. A dazzling, delightful masterpiece, that's amazingly good for the soul, heartfelt and a prefect blend of modern and vintage style. [edit] Being nominated for 14 Oscars, 11 BAFTA awards and won 7 Golden Globes should speaks volumes. I was totally swept off my feet and urge everyone to watch this film, at least twice. \n\nRunning Time: 9\nThe Cast: 10\nPerformance: 9\nDirection: 10\nStory: 10\nScript: 10\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 10\nJob Description: 10\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10\n\n98% 9/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

            "content": "Let's have a frank discussion of expectations, because there are 2 big problems that might arise when you enter a theater with expectations. The first of these is if you expect more than the film can possibly deliver. Nothing makes a movie feel more like garbage than going in expecting a masterpiece and finding it underwhelming. That gap between what you anticipated and what you got makes the quality feel worse than it was in reality. This problem certainly came to play with me and La La Land. It wasn't necessarily that the critics had begun to anoint this film as the second-coming savior of the entire free world, because I already had high hopes before a single critic posted a review. It was a musical (and I love a musical,) it was directed by Damien Chazelle (who I thought crushed it with Whiplash,) and it looked like a joyous escapist love story (some of my favorite types of film.) So when I got to the theater and had trouble understanding lyrics in the opening number, found the plot bland and derivative, and didn't sense the joy in the whole proceeding it deflated me like a balloon. I was angry, and felt betrayed. Although I wasn't quite as angry as the ladies next to me in the theater who loudly proclaimed \"That was terrible!\" as soon as the credits started to roll. In reality, the look of the film is marvelous, there were a couple of songs that worked, and I sensed the passion for the subject matter in Chazelle's heart. But because I expected near perfection, this film let me down a lot.\n\nThe second problem with expectations is when you go into a theater expecting one kind of movie and there is a bait-and-switch which leaves you with a different kind of movie than you wanted. It's easy to feel frustrated as you keep watching and waiting for the type of movie you wanted to get started. That also happened with La La Land for me. Let's be clear right here and now: This movie is a relationship drama first and foremost. Anyone or anything that tries to sell you on the fact that you will be enjoying a throwback to the classic musicals of old Hollywood is selling you a false bill of goods. While there are certainly a few musical numbers, La La Land does not feel like those delightful films from the olden days. In fact there is a segment almost an entire hour long in the middle of the film where it seems like someone forgot this was a musical. The film wilts on the vine and my wife and I started wiggling in our seats with boredom. Also, it's worth noting that the singing is not very good in this film, and the dancing is possibly worse. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone do not have strong voices, and I feel almost zero emotion in most of their performances. Long gone are the days of Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, or Judy Garland. These people struggle to carry the tune, and certainly don't have any dance moves that impress. But getting back to the whole bait-and-switch thing, I just have to say (without spoiling anything) I at least hoped to leave the theater with a smile on my face, but they couldn't even deliver that in the end. To be clear, I recognize this is not a terrible film. It looks remarkable, and I might appreciate the story if I watched it again knowing what is coming. However, right now, the difference between my expectations and what I got are so dramatically different that it feels like I hated La La Land.",

Why is it so controversial? There's no doubt we have already seen that it has an extensive list of nominations and that it will certainly continue receiving awards. People wonder if it is the best movie or the most overrated film of 2016, so by analyzing it, we find in first instance that this film has an argument more than hackneyed and the subject that has being treated has been experienced too many times by dozens of directors. It is a charming musical that explains the spontaneous and inconsistently magical encounter of two people whose feelings will be threatened by the dreams they seek. In fact, that one is the key objective of this proposal: the pursuit of our dreams. For every person who has set goals, this film is wonderful while those who simply judge it by the innumerable clich\u00e9s the film has, then they'll say this has an annoying and boring effect. As the film progresses you can notice several things: on the one hand it starts with one musical after another, this is fantastic, very fun and joyful, however everything is lost because there is not a good story beyond being a \"simple tale\" with a disastrous storyline. Then we have no music and it seems that the musical is over and now a romantic drama has begun. However it is during the final stretch of the film when it improves remarkably.\nIt is not correct to say that it is overrated, because in itself, the film really transmits a strong load of harmony and wonder with the fine performances that  Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have and the good chemistry that appears between both. Nevertheless, it is based on so many musicals that we have seen like \"Singing in the Rain\" that the creators of La La Land did not even deny. The movie is not extraordinary nor leaves any kind of shocking message, and this is because it is a classic story where fame is sought with all the stumbles that the city of Los Angeles is characterized, but where white characters are used, developing a love story directed to the people of the same race. So it turns out that this becomes a musical of the style that Americans adore, serving as a symbol of what Hollywood loves to do and in which they are specialists, making the film as a compilation of the elements taken from the 50's and 60's but adapted with the new generations. Yes, La La Land is beautiful, but just that.",

Director Damien Chazelle relies on the usage of bright colors to pop during night-time scenes. It's a simplistic yet cool effect that subtlely manages to keep your attention on the screen. The film often utilizes Mia and Sebastian as focal points for shots that are both appealing and memorable. You'll see them dancing among the stars. Spotting each other in a crowded room while the rest of the world is paused. It's these small touches that move La La Land from good to great.\n\nThe film has a consistenly impactful way of evoking emotion. You feel like you're on a journey with Mia and Sebastian, rooting for them to succeed both personally and professionally. I can't recall many films that are simultaneously heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time.\n\nLa La Land is far from forgettable. I have plenty of good things to say and I haven't even touched on the music. The songs will stay in your head well after the film is over. They say music has a way of telling a story without the use of words. After seeing this film, I couldn't agree more. The music coupled with stellar acting performances from Gosling and Stone set La La Land apart from other films I saw in 2016. I give it a 94.",

Do I think Emma's performance was enough to earn her Best Actress Academy Award? No... I think there were other nominations more worthy of recognition, however in such a strong year all the actresses deserved recognition. The cinematography is TO DIE FOR and is probably some of the best I've seen in recent years, proving that La La Land is not just a postcard picture film but was also an incredibly hard film to make, as each glimpse of a Los Angeles sunset frames and fuels the story in every way that Gosling and Stone do. Musicals are dying and La La Land wants to resuscitate. The story is craftily done and is so vintage that I kept having to remind myself it is actually set in the present day, as one minute its The King and I with its purity and vintage playfulness, but then we catch a glimpse of a smartphone or a rendition of the 80's hit \"Take On Me\" . It's clever and pure.",

Do they not understand that we love story and talent and don't care if Ryan Gosling is in the movie, singing and dancing when he can clearly do neither. These two wouldn't last a qualifying round for Dancing With the Stars and yet are cast as the leads in a blockbuster musical? Simply because of their name. And the film suffers in pain for it, along with the audience. This is one of those films that Hollywood loves because everyone in town has decided they're supposed to love it. This town is great at that; agreeing with itself. And critics don't criticize; they idolize. They're as caught up in the mirror gazing as the rest of the industry. The true tragedy about this film lies in what it could have been. You want to know how to make it? First get a script-writer. But, after that, call Broadway and find some real, legitimate, mind-blowing, musical stars and go from there. I got this for free and took three sittings to make myself get through it so I could see the ending that everybody hated. The film is excruciating, aside from Emma. It's like the makers of the film ignored the story the film was trying to tell and turned it into a multi-million dollar high school musical by casting the two most popular kids in school.",

Behold the story of Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) who is a musician who dreams of reclaiming the soul of jazz and opening his own club, and Mia (Emma Stone) who is a diner clerk who dreams of becoming a successful actress, Historia may be simple and clich\u00e9, it's the kind of things we're already tired of seeing in the movies, but we've never seen it that way, you can believe, it's been many years since we've seen something with such flawless direction when la land, It starts simple, it's usually simple, but at one point it completely flushes out of the clich\u00e9, comes to life, drives, enchants and surprises, and not in the most dangerous of moments - the ending - it disappoints, its conclusion is perfect, beautiful and memorable. It is very cliche to make a movie about love, novelty is always the way to treat this love, and here we see something completely different, we have a message that goes against all the standard of hollywood, we have a moral where it says love Is not always above everything, we can give it up to pursue our dreams, but that does not mean that we will stop loving, for even renegade, impossible and depreciated, love never dies with time. Technically La Land is perfect, it would be a complete exaggeration to say that it is the best photograph of the cinema, but it was the best I saw on the cinema screen, its lighting is out of series, the way light is thrown from one side To symbolize loneliness, love, anger and fear, even to highlight the unique moment of a character or to reflect the green of hope in Emma Stone's face in the dining room, we can understand the whole movie only by Its lighting, all its counter-planes are brilliant, and all the scenes in sequences plans - they are not few - they are perfect and completely enthralling, worth a highlight for the first scene of the movie, after watching this scene, you will make a point of paying another Ticket, I'll leave here my thanks, to the cinematographer of this film, linus sandgren. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are completely out of character, given to roles and with an impressive chemistry the couple loves everyone, not only with their dances and kisses, but in their ways of looking, behaving, mania and malice, was very well deserved His nominations to Oscar, and Damien Chazelle, is already next to Denis Villeneuve, as the names of the new generation of directors, even try only 3 movies in his cinematography, Damien surprises and shocks everyone again, before with whiplash, now with La la land, his films are exciting, dark, cheerful and simply sensational. La La Land is worth it, it's a different musical from everything you've ever seen, even if you do not like the genre, please take a chance, after all competing in I3 Oscar categories, it's not for anyone.",

The worst part was that, while I thoroughly like both actors, neither Gosling or Stone had the voice or movement ability to pull off this work despite the simple dance steps and obvious dubbing over many scenes. The movie had the the feel of a first rehearsal and did not measure up to even the most obscure television musicals that have entire series to produce on lower budgets. This was a sweet movie and it was mostly bearable to sit through. Perhaps it was amateur feel and appeal that was being sought, which is fine. However, this aspect was taken a bit too far.",

LA LA LAND fulfilled in ways I hadn't expected. Shooting dance numbers head-to-toe in long takes brings energy and excitement, VS the trend in recent decades to cut-cut-cut close-up shots. Frankly, in MOULIN ROUGE and CHICAGO, I could have done the \"dancing,\" which is comprised mainly of closeups furiously edited.\nI was also impressed by the establishing of musical themes that resonate throughout.",

Yes it is a musical and no, not so much a chick flick just more of a modern musical feel with a splash of 1940's World's Fair feel to it. \n\nMia (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress trying to get into the industry of Hollywood, who runs into Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a man literally driven by Jazz Music, both are struggling to \"make it big\"  slowly at first develop a relationship which takes them on a journey to go after their dreams even if a long the way things don't go the way they want to. Yeah Original Story...... \n\nI had heard two things about this movie. ONE IT IS AMAZING and Two it's Overrated but good.  I liked it. Didn't hate it. But don't think it is AMAZING in all aspects. Story it self everyone has seen before, especially in musicals. The cast is really good, Credit to Stone and the eye candy. The songs are....well I know the tune if I hear it again. But not something that I recall straight away.\n\nBUT The cinematography and the editing of this is AMAZING! So rich in color makes it seem like it is a play on stage at times. It is like if Moulin Rouge took a breathe and slowed down and was actually good. The Dance numbers don't have any cuts and they are just continuous, will give credit where it is due BUT Broadway actors and fellow theater people do that all the time so not something I'll usually say it was amazing, but felt fresh. \n\nAgain, It is a present day Musical that feels like a musical from the 30's and 40's with the world's fair style to it. Very well done but I don't 2hrs is necessary. WAY BETTER than recent musicals for films like Mamma Mia, Moulin Rouge and even Phantom of the Opera. Just didn't find it as New and Revolutionary as critics have made it out to be.\n\nAGAIN I enjoyed it. Had my little nit picks with it but maybe that is because with musicals I tend to lean towards The Little Shop of Horror's, Sweeny Todd's, Avenue Q's or Phantoms over the Sound of Musics and King and I's\n\n3 STARS",

I honestly could not tell what it was really about from the trailers.\nThe music is so tasteful and well done that there isn't really anything I can complain about. I'm not a fan of modern musicals but I must say this was original, moving and God the ending was good.\nThere is also something to be said about their theme song, which I admittedly immediately added to my Spotify playlist.

I had dragged my musical-hating other half along, and alas this is not the film to send him leaping for joy into the aisles of Soho theatres, far from it.  Once upon a time, songs had lyrics which told a story.  Once upon a time, musicals had songs which told stories.  These stories were told clearly through clarity of diction and lyrical intelligibility.  La La Land is a cacophony of mime and piffle.  I could start with the relentlessly vacuous wide-eyed blankness of the heroine, or with the scruffy immaturity of its hero, I could begin with the criticism that neither has the slightest yearning to bring happiness to any character save their own self-pitying, self-indulgent, self-obsessed, worthless self.  But instead, I pity the actors, the pre-producers, the post-producers, the composer, sundry editors and the entire cast who had been given such scant materials with which to create a film.  The plot is thin (read: emaciated) and no matter how many tap dances, abrupt cuts, vibrant outfits or quirky sets the audience is presented with, a flatlining script is simply beyond rescue.  Put simply; I was bored.  Not once did my heart bound, not once was it touched and this was because the script was empty, bland and soulless.  Therefore, I write this as a warning; do not believe the misleading hype, lest you, like me, should be sadly disappointed.  As for next Sunday, I shall return to my bath.",

Emma Stone (Mia) & Ryan Gosling (Sebastian) are perfectly capable (albeit flawed, but nonetheless) people on their own, trying to make their way through the neverland of Hollywood, but when coupled together, are painted with very unrealistically forced chemistry that just does not work for me as the crux of this film. I found it both shallow & unbelievable how their arc unfolded while together, and by the end of the film, felt better that they actually went their separate ways.\nIf not for the message inspiring optimism to the dreamers out there, I probably would have written this off worse than I'm making it seem. But it does have that heart, and I get it. I get why this film is as loved as it is...I just don't think it's the greatest thing since the invention of the camera, is all.

It has a fresh, searing intelligence to it and is much better than his previous film 'Whiplash', which had some similar themes (male obsessions, jazz, etc).\n\nIt is a film of two halves, a bit like it's template (which it subverts) Singing In The Rain. In the first hour, its a romantic boy meets girl tale. But the second hour shifts into - which one of them will achieve their dreams? Both? Neither? And this is where it turns convention on it's head. Because in the traditional romantic tale, the boy and the girl get married and live happily ever after. No, this is 2017, and the feminist message prevails. Girl gets dream - but not with this obsessed jazzer. She gets success, husband, child - but not the guy who we saw in the first hour, but another, richer guy. Our hero, he gets success, but is left lonely masturbating his piano keys all alone. In the sexless world of romantic musicals, our hero bends over backwards for her love, and when she gets what she wants from him - she goes off to her success and he is left playing the piano. He pumps her up, sells out himself, makes her write her one man show, cooks her dinner, drives her to her successful (and for him, fatal) audition. She does zilch for him.Nothing. That's because it's all about Mia (me), geddit?\n\nWhile Ryan Gosling is a handsome, contained obsessive (almost autistic), she is a flat chested, google-eyed baby. Neither and sing well or dance but somehow that does not distract too much. Nor is there any lust in this film, only 'romance.' That is enough of an explanation for the audience. But it seems a bit inadequate for me.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I was going with the flow like most other viewers of this film. I  loved its smooth surrealism, some of its tunes, and overall flow. In particular, the final flashback flourish of an alternative ending - the only way to resolve the ending in a way that was NOT tragic (for Seb, the 'hero') - this was astonishing, bravura film making. \n\nLa La is a dead cert for Best Picture 2017 - it is too clever and in touch with the modern audience to lose out. Musicals without professional singers and dancers? You need a professional writer and director, and that's Mr. Chazz.",

La La Land takes you into the \"romantic\" Hollywood style of film. The vocal ability of the film's stars were good enough and they matched each other in the colorful and at times stylized scenes. The Director managed to keep the storyline ahead of your thinking and what I particularly liked was the musical arrangement of direction of this score... Good musical film with pleasing romantic storyline and likable characters.. You sit there, at times, with a silly grin on your face.

Lucky for us all, that wait was blessedly brief with La La Land. \n\nMany critics will repeat what was said about the release of The Artist, which similarly \"breathed new life\" into the genre of musical film. However, Chazelle's modern yet nostalgic expression of a 21st century musical is genuinely refreshing. The Los Angeles depicted onscreen is unlike any one I have seen before, and yet the story feels so very familiar. Two star-crossed lovers, both artists struggling in their own right, trying to find room in a crowded Hollywood. Through it all, the film is imbued with an irrepressible joy, from the very first set piece right up to when the credits roll.\n\nEmma Stone is the star of La La Land, with Ryan Gosling just about her match. The chemistry is palpable from the start, which only carries over to the song and dance routines throughout. For two actors of limited musical experience to pull off an achievement of this magnitude is tremendous, and their passion fills the screen.\n\nTechnically of course, the film is beautiful to look at. Chazelle made astute choices to marry the contemporary with the vintage, even down to the car Gosling's character drives and the long takes. With another superb Justin Hurwitz soundtrack, we have gotten the musical we never knew we wanted, or needed.",

I appreciate the desire to make a movie that's a throwback to the musical genre, but it's too hodgepodge. There were moments, but just a few of them. They can act, but it was obvious they were pushing their chops with singing and dancing. THAT was not tap dancing. Ryan Gosling was impressive on the piano, but I was not sold on Emma Stone. If they wanted to sell the singing, then they shouldn't have had a professional such as John Legend in the movie. His pipes proved how lackluster the other musical numbers were performed. I enjoyed the ending sequence minus the obvious American in Paris cliches. The rest of it was very original. Thank god they didn't sing in the rain!  I wanted to leave after the first 45 min, but I just had to stay and see how it played out. I felt the actors needed another couple months of dance lessons (with the exception of RG's dance with the older woman on the pier. That was lovely.) I will leave this on a good note.

It's a musical, but unlike most animated films put out by Disney, this movie is geared towards a more adult audience. That's not to say that you can't bring the whole family along. It barely earns a PG-13 rating.\n\nRyan Gosling delivers an exceptionally good performance, especially with the jazz piano he had to learn. Emma stone brings a lot of heart and soul, and really makes you feel during the lower points of the plot. And speaking of the plot, it was refreshing to see one where the focus was almost entirely character driven. This can be quite hard to pull off when you're not dealing with an ensemble cast, but Gosling and Stone did a great job. That's not to say that supporting performers like John Legend lag behind. Everyone in this film has a part to play.\n\nIf you're like me and not a musical lover, it's worth giving this one a shot. Unlike modern takes on Les Miserables, this film doesn't force you to sit through endless amounts of plot-device-songs. The musical numbers are tastefully used, especially the jazzy numbers.

Stone plays Mia, an aspiring actress working in a coffee bar on the Warner Brothers lot, and working from audition to audition with little success. The two are drawn together through a number of chance encounters and so begins a love affair including some wonderful song and dance moments.\n\nThe two have worked together before in both Gangster Squad and Crazy Silly Love and their onscreen chemistry remains and works perfectly for this film. What this film brings though is a whole new level of both of their previous work with singing, dancing and on Gosling's part, piano playing.\n\nThe initial half of the film is stuffed with musical set pieces from the opening number with cars in a traffic jam, through to 'Fred and Ginger'-esque sequences between Gosling and Stone.  There is less a standout song, rather more a standout musical melody that weaves through the film (and is the basis for the 'City of Stars' song that does feature).\n\nIt also is as much a love story towards Hollywood itself with its references and usage of previous film classics and sentiment towards LA.\n\nThere is a point in the film where Gosling is discussing Jazz with a fellow band member. The band member says that although their music is different to the classics of the past, the people that created that classics were innovators. As a result, new work has to not just repeat the old, but create the new and be bold enough to be different from the past that inspires it...\n\nThis dialogue gives us context about the structure of the film itself. The song played at one point that starts as classic jazz, but then shifts into something new but with the spirit of the past, seems to capture the principle of the entire film itself.\n\nChazelle is clearly passionate about music within film and what he has made here is not just a traditional musical, but with stronger emotion and more of a character romantic drama than I expected. I suspect how Sebastian talks about Jazz in the film Chazelle may well in part feel about musicals in real life.\n\nNot only is La La Land a love letter to the best and brightest of Hollywood and a re-emergence of the classical musical style, but it also shifts through the film and challenges the genre itself. This is the real strength of the film.\n\nFrom both the quality of the film, and the generous sentiment towards Hollywood, this film will do very well through the awards season, and that's not unfair.",

Whenever she sang the fantasy of the movie came to a crashing halt. Fortunately she does not sing for too much of the movie. It would have been a great tribute to the films of old if someone who could sing dubbed for Miss. Stone. At least she is no Pierce Brosnan in Mama Mia. Mr Gosling is no Sinatra but he is passable.  I totally enjoyed the dance sequences with Stone and Gosling. It was at that point I would get lost in the movie.",

            "content": "La La Land is a very special film as it's something we never really see anymore. It's extremely rare for a big budget and high profile Hollywood musical to be made, but now we have La La Land. This is the latest film from up and coming director Damien Chazelle who previously directed the modern masterpiece Whiplash and wrote the brilliant yet underrated 10 Cloverfield Lane. La La Land is a fantastic movie! This is the kind of film that needs to be experienced on the biggest screen possible as this really is a masterpiece. This film is amazingly directed by Chazelle, he brilliantly stages all the musical scenes but is also able to tell a very heartwarming and mature film. It's a technical masterpiece with fantastic production design, costumes and sets. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren is a marvel for the eyes and the film looks amazing. It's the kind of movie where you could take a freeze frame and hang it on your wall as it all looks so amazing. The musical set prices are brilliantly filmed with lots of excellent pans, zooms and unbroken shots. The music is also amazing. This film will undoubtedly win the Academy Award for 'Best Original Song' and deservedly so as the songs are a perfect balance of fun, crowd pleasing and beautiful. The dance choreography is brilliant, the opening number is so well done and staged. The dance scene with Gosling and Stone is also fantastically done. Speaking of which the acting is superb. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have previously worked together on Crazy Stupid Love and this film further cements what a perfect paring they are due to their fantastic chemistry. Both are excellent here and play off each other brilliantly. Emma Stone is truly excellent, she's charismatic, she's funny, she's charming, she's endearing and it's all down to the wonderful performance from Stone who will undoubtedly win an Oscar for her truly spectacular acting job here. Ryan Gosling is also brilliant, I was worried from the trailers he would just be playing a very sad character but while he is at times he's also unbelievably funny here just like his work in 2016's The Nice Guys. Gosling really gives it his all as his character is so likeable and funny and it's truly some of his best work. He has a few scenes where he plays the piano here and I wouldn't be surprised if he learnt all the numbers just like Miles Teller did for his drum solo in Whiplash. Gosling and Stone also have surprisingly brilliant singing voices which I wasn't expecting. La La Land feels really unique due to the unique look and honestly beautiful sequences that honestly make you want to watch this film again and again. The film is also a perfect mix of poignantly sad and unbelievably entertaining and fun. I don't think I've smiled at a film so much in a long time as this is a really heart warming movie. The ending however is very clever as it's so hopeful but also so sad. As for problems La La Land has very few minor ones. One was the film is a bit too long as it feels like you could cut about 10 or so minutes, also there's a boyfriend character introduced early in the film who feels quite unnecessary. There's also a bit where a character played by musician John Legend appears and a tension is somewhat introduced between him and Gosling but it never goes anywhere. However these problems are easy to forget with just how excellent this film is. La La Land is flawed and not quite as good as Whiplash but it's still amazing and one of the best movie musicals ever. A truly excellent film that should be seen by all and is proof of what talents Chazelle and everyone who worked here truly are. La La Land is a true modern masterpiece. A",

I had already seen some comments about this movie being uplifting and just plain enjoyable. So it seemed like the perfect movie to launch us into the year. And I was completely right. From the opening traffic jam dance number to the closing sweeping montage of storytelling I was lost in a beautiful world of optimism and music. I had a constant smile. Well mostly. The film is still real enough and filled with enough varied emotions that you get to feel waves of sadness alongside all the joy. But even those beautiful heart wrenching scenes just make you appreciate this film more and want to leave the cinema skipping and dancing around street lights. I have been an Emma Stone fan for a while now but I love that I have been converted into a Ryan Gosling fan as well. Their chemistry is magnetic. I absolutely loved La La Land and you might too. I know at least one person who detests musicals and would probably struggle with this movie. But if you are normal like me, and love musical theatre, then you will get a big kick out of La La Land.",

The film shines through a well balanced story, a remarkable editing which makes the film always being perfectly paced; a nostalgic cinematography: shot on film, and supersaturated colors; adding an well choreographed camera movements, and always supported by a montage that reciprocate with the tone and mood of the film. Those latter elements build up for a loose and sober directing by Damien Chazelle, who it can be noted that he's perfectly comfortable with weighing in the responsability  of the movie to the protagonist, which in this case, are perfectly casted and impeccable performed by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, who shows are fine chemistry to react with empathy throughout the film. To conclude, La la land, revitalize the musical film genre to empathize with new generations, its sobriety with telling of the story creates comfort with audiences with no familiarity of the genre; and the film has the equilibrium for both, music and film goers, who will not be disappointed. \n\nHowever, considering the film one of the frontrunners in the Award Season, La la land is quite powered up on technical categories (editing, production and costume design, cinematography, original score and song) but, on major categories the film start to languish: On acting categories, though Gosling and Stone give dazzling perfomances cannot be located on the powerhouse perfomance, there's a lack of range in the development of their characters, which their charms are based on the choreographies, music and suitable locations, lacking on emotional depth; the latter, helps on the directing side because of the momentum that the becoming of events rise on the sensation of catharsis; that's why director Damien Chazelle, plays safe with musical film genre and even more on the screenplay side, which is conveniently crafted to serve as reflection of 50's, 60's and 70's films which kept a similar mood in much of the design of the film (which is justified in a dialog in the movie), and must of all, this nostalgic and intertextuality create a poor challenging as a contender for this category.

            "content": "Reviewed 1.20.17. As a fan of the classic song & dance movies of yesteryear, I like everything the movie is trying to do. I just wish it did them better. It is indeed a charming homage, but it falls far short of actually replicating the genius of its inspirational material. \n\nI realize it isn't fair to expect modern actors to dance like Gene Kelly & Syd Charisse. They were trained as dancers, whereas modern actors simply take a crash course in the art. The days of Fred Astaire are long gone. But on the flip side, Emma Stone demonstrates how today's performers are actually better actors. And as much as Ryan Gosling seems grossly miscast, he does bring the classic Gosling charm to the role. \n\nDamien Chazelle deserves credit for taking these sort of bold chances, but he does not universally deliver the goods. The pacing slows too much at times, the dialogue has its weak moments, and the tone shifts all over. Abrupt tonal shifts fit masterfully in his wonderful movie Whiplash, but instead keep this movie off kilter throughout. And for a movie billed as a bold return to musicals, let's just say none of these tunes will be remembered as classics. \n\nThe last moment with the two leads was also a missed chance. A classic Gene Kelly wink and Audrey Hepburn smile would have been the perfect cherry. The movie can't seem to decide whether to mine the melancholy or campy angle, but is at its best with the latter. \n\nDespite these short-comings, there are enough bits and pieces here for those enamored with the genre. I can see how the uninitiated would find it pleasant enough, it's basically the light beer of musicals. And it seems that in a bad year for 'academy-type' movies, it's drink enough for most. For me, I'm gonna mix up an Old Fashioned and pull the real deal off my movie shelf.",

Now before I get into this review I would love to say this movie had me in tears, it had me laughing, it was a beautiful tribute to the olden day movies/musicals. The singing was perfect, the dancing was adorable and multiple times I wanted to join in.  Truly a masterpiece.  Now onto the review.  I won't spoil anything but a fair warning to those who want to see the movie, the ending, sadly, ruined it for me.  In this film you had 2 people who started out as enemies really but due to some coincidental circumstances get to know one another and develop into these beautiful, passionate human beings.  As you watch their relationship flourish and watch their interactions, the way they build one another up and truthfully push each other to achieve their dreams, you're captivated and inspired and see the importance of each other in their lives.  But then, as the movie synopsis says, things get in the way.  Again I don't want to give anything away but the ending left me...wanting, it left me confused, it left me angry.  It's a must see musical, don't get me wrong, but towards the end of the film I wanted to walk out.  This could have been the perfect ending.",

This was a Hollyeood version of jazz, and so contributes to the mown in the film that it is dying. Like the film it had no real heart or soul...all surface.  Maybe that was the subtle point but I doubt it. Certainly no chemistry between the stars, and the theme may have been plangent but I found it wanting. I was unmoved until maybe the scene where she auditions and sings, again clever rather than felt. I think the word I would use is manufactured, and the magic scene in the planetarium just seemed odd. I kept thinking about the innovative and wonderful Moulin Rouge and hoped for that sense of unreality and fantasy, but it never came. Sorry folks 2 stars max and utter incomprehension at the mass hype. And what about those odd Anime type eyes she has?",

            "content": "WHAT I LIKED: Damien Chazelle's 'Whiplash' made you so nervous you could burst, but the beauty of his 'La La Land' is that it manages to play with all of your emotions. I cried, I felt empathetic for the leads, I felt reflective, but most of all I felt happy; happy that this charming film exists, and just happy with myself for being a film and music-lover in general. Yes, the sheer fact great music and beautiful filmic moments can be put together so wonderfully had me catching myself looking up frequently in proud admiration of what talent can do.\nAnd actually, this is a film that gets you to look at yourself rather a lot. Mainly, and pretty incredibly, the way it explores people's views of the past whilst also in itself representing a thing of yesterday means you feel the themes extremelly directly - in other words the affect the film's own nostalgia cards have on you make you realise what Gosling's character in particular is all about.\nAs for Stone's? Well her arc is about dreams just as much as Gosling's is also, and that's clearly something Chazelle is fascinated by. But don't for a moment think this is a film where the themes come at the expense of anything else, as they work organically with the characters to form genuinely poetic and beautiful arcs for them to go on. That marriage between theme and character is one of the most crucial ingredients in this kind of film, and luckily here I felt I understood the two enchanting leads right from the start. Their chemistry is magnetic, they stand on their own, and Gosling and Stone's pairing with Chazelle's genious writing and direction brings the very best out of an allready-great story.\nTheir development is also helped by the musical elements too, and whilst this was something I was slightly concerned about going in, the arrangements work because they organically explore and further the characters, but also because they're used in the perfect moments and never overwhelm Chazelle's ever-apparent ability to deal with nervous silences. Basically though, it never feels like a cheesy excuse for a song and dance, more an ironic neccessity (though I have to say the splendour of the score and coreography means I probably wouldn't have minded if it wasn't in this instance anyway).\nIn the end though, all this development and character enrichment builds two very dream-like characters, who yet also feel so real - which is one lucky thing, as their beautiful love story is the foundation for everything else. With that, and whilst using all the things I've talked about so far, Chazelle layers on top a brilliantly nostalgic and light-hearted tone, a visual masterpiece, a technical joy and a film that all-in-all won my heart as much as it did my mind. La La Land is an incredible yet charming movie that achieves so much so well, and if you haven't seen it, you should definitely go to the theatre and support it. Honestly it's brilliant.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Whilst its enjoyable light-hearted nature made it a real joy, there were a few moments where I felt it could have taken itself a little more seriously overall.\nVERDICT: 5/5 - This encompasses so much and delivers all of it so expertly. How Damien Chazelle is allready this assured frankly stumps me... what a guy, and what a beautiful movie.",

At times we think he might take a shot at telling his story entirely through tunes. At times we think the film's musical aspect has gone completely out of the window. But, for the most part, we just sit back and smile while all the general breeziness distracts from the impenetrably formulaic romance at the film's heart.\nLa La Land takes an introspective turn in its latter reels, but until then, its no more than an escapist treat led by a skilled cast and a superb director, whose high concept permits his imagination to run wild.",

The relationship between the two protagonists was both believable and captivating, laying the foundations for an enthralling narrative without shortage of surprises. This film truly surpassed my expectations for what a musical could offer, so much so that my friend couldn't quite believe his ears when I told him I'd loved it!",

            "content": "You know how there are certain movies that give you the willies (maybe it's a minority thing).  For example, White Christmas.  I watched the movie because it's one of my mom's holiday fare favorites.  But it always bugged me.  For me it was literally white Christmas filled with extraordinarily white people, groomed to perfection.  The snow didn't make me feel any better either because all we have in Los Angeles is gray pavement.  I love old movies, but I hated that one.  Whenever I hear Bing Crosby's voice on the radio come Christmas time, I change the station.  That's because there's no room for me in that world.  That's the type of place where disgruntled America wants to go back to. \n\n \n\nLa La Land gives me the same fluttery feeling.  The story is simple.  Nothing we haven't seen before about struggling artists with expensive 1950s new-vintage attire driving Prius' and trying to attain their dreams -- only it's peppered with song and dance routines.  The movie is so in love with the past, the good ol' past where people like me can't visit.  The movie was hugging the 1950s and 1960s like my neutered dog ghost-humping my leg.  If they chose to embrace the 1940s, people like me would've been thrown in Manzanar even though I'm not Japanese.  In the '50s I would've been exploited in the fields in Central Valley, California, picking prunes and cash crops. \n\n \n\nLa La Land is pretty to look at.  I'm really not into musicals but the singing and dancing was okay.  No Astaire and Rogers there.  Emma Stone's voice was way too quiet, but what do I know, I sound like a duck in a tub.  Ryan Gosling plays the piano well and was a good student, but the music is not that sick.  I have records of jazz pianists like Art Tatum, Thelonius Monk, Dave Brubeck, and so on, and what Gosling played was pitiful in comparison for a supposed musical genius to lord over kolordz musicians.  Watch Jazz by Ken Burns and listen to what I'm talking about.\n\n \n\nSince I love Los Angeles, I enjoyed the scenery (hey what's up, Watts), but the fluttering and feeling of fear that this kind of reverie about the olden days kept me sedated and worried.  They showed the good stuff,  Griffith Park Observatory which I'm never going to visit again, million dollar homes with swimming pools, and Watts Towers.  Watts Towers, you say?  I sure didn't see wandering dogs or the bleeding-soul neighborhood like the one I know.  The towers that symbolize courage and hope for the neighborhood who are gripped with poverty and prejudice was used as a dating background. \n\n \n\nThat's what bothers me about this movie.  It's all too nice and clean.  My neighborhood is actually more colorful.  Paleta man, fruit vendors that offer lemon, salt, and chile in a plastic bag, and a lot of under-dressed Latinos and Asians that liven the neighborhood.  I didn't see my true city in the movie.  Even gentrified Grand Central Market looked too New York.  Gosling's interracial friends seemed so fake that whenever we see them, she's kissing him and he's looking static.  Tacked on. \n\n \n\nI'm worried that this damn movie might beat Moonlight for best picture of the year.  Moonlight is not a replica of anything.  It's a complete original.  Not Barbie and Ken busting it out on the backdrop of a famous Los Angeles view.  And yeah, I'll kill it and tell you the end.  They both realize their dreams.  You know why?  Because they are... \n\n \n\nDamien Chazelle, this is L.A. not New Jersey or New Hampshire.  We Angelenos are proud of our diversity.  There are folks worthy of film parts besides your windup ballerina dancer world.  To be kind, I loved Whiplash.  Best drum movie since Mickey Rooney's five-minute Andy Hardy impression of Gene Krupa.  Think Trump, man.  Make your next film about Kolordz people trying to get in the industry and getting passed on for white actors.  I really hope you don't win Best Picture, man.  You got enough Globes to feed your reveries. 2whitecinema.",

How wrong I was. La La Land is so much more than fun. It is a beautiful, heartfelt tale told in incredible fashion. It is the kind of film that makes you want to laugh, cry, and cheer, sometimes all at once.\n\nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling may me the most relatable, young actors in Hollywood today. There is this sort of unassuming everyman quality about them that causes you to fall instantly in love with their characters and become immediately invested in their fictional lives. Both bring an incredible emotional range and realism to their performances and their on-screen chemistry is perfect.\n\nLa La Land is not merely well performed. It is also beautifully and artfully shot and lit. Writer/Director Damien Chazelle's use of light to direct the viewer's attention is highly creative and more akin to something you'd expect from a live performance. The overall visual presentation is wonderfully composed and features stellar camera work.\n\nIt should be noted that La La Land is a musical. It's an unusual musical in that it contains no catchy show tunes, memorable vocal performances or showstopping dance numbers. To be clear, the music and dance in this film is good. The jazz melodies are beautiful and the singers can all sing, and choreographer Mandy Moore (no, not that Mandy Moore) has crafted some very satisfying dance sequences. However, where many musicals from the \"Golden Age\" were big on spectacle and many of our modern musicals are more concerned with social/political commentary, this musical just wants to tell you a story. It's a story of two people with big dreams and the joy, pain, hope, despair, success and failure they experience on the journey to achieving those dreams. The story is the main attraction and the other stuff is just there to help tell it.\n\nLa La Land is witty, fun, intelligent, poignant, and authentic, a breathtaking artistic achievement with loads of heart. I was made to feel so many emotions, from sadness and regret to joy and hope and walked out smiling through my tears.Anyone who leaves the theater without a tear in there eye, a spring in their step, hope in their heart, and a renewed desire to chase their own dreams is dead inside and there is no hope for them.",

The only thing that I thought was worth watching in this was the gorgeous Ryan Gosling but even so, I had to mute the screen whenever he spoke to avoid being put off during my wank.

Once you get past the tweeness of it all and the film settles down I really began to enjoy the film and the chemistry between the two leads.\n\nThe film looks gorgeous, with a rich colour pallet and I really liked the subtle nods to the films of 50's and 60's especially with regard to how the film is shot. \n\nAs with all good musical what sets it apart is the strength of it's song and dance numbers and La La Land provides some memorable moments especially a scene which is featured on the film's poster of Emma and Ryan dancing against the backdrop of Los Angeles but I think my favourite songs are City of Stars and Here's to the Hearts.\n\nLa La Land is by no means perfect as many critics would have you believe, however it is very enjoyable and in an age of so much uncertainty it's a great piece of escapism.",

The film features a great soundtrack, great cinematography and direction, but the few songs that are present feel out of place. As someone who enjoys musicals, I had high hopes for La La Land but sadly the songs felt awkwardly presented. This is possibly because the lead actors are not the most natural of singers, which is easily noticeable. If I could change the film, I would include more of the Jazz soundtrack, and lessen the songs with vocals. Overall it's still a good film and certainly worth a watch for the style alone.",

I could have lived without the dancing and the mediocre singing. I didn't feel they added anything to the story itself. Leave those scenes out and you've got a decent film. And you would have had time to explore Sebastian's sister who was an interesting character in the beginning of the movie but then quickly forgotten. Also John Legend in a supporting role was a good choice but it would have been nice to learn more about his character's history with Sebastian. Now it was just noted in a side remark.The film was full of references to the true classic films of the 50's and I can see this going down well with the members of the Academy. I hope they can resist the nostalgia.",

But I do love originality, great acting, and a new take on the same story. That's what La La Land is.\nThe movie is for both dreamers and romantics. Two people, one with a dream for acting and the other for music, meet by chance. There is foreplay, flirting, dancing, singing, and then of course love. It happens naturally and it is hard not to fall in love with these characters as they are falling in love with each other. Especially when played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, their third time around playing love interests. They live in Hollywood and they inspire each other to be best they can be and to keep chasing their dreams. But, like dreams usually are, they bring heartbreak and drama into their relationship. Real drama, not the usual Hollywood movie type, but the kind that nearly everyone watching can relate to. One of the best moments in the film is a painful dinner scene with Stone and Gosling arguing about how their relationship is going to stay intact while they both keep pursuing their dreams.\nNow their was about 20-30 minutes in the middle of the film that felt dragged out and lost my interest for awhile. But, the ending is very powerful and deep. It is one of the best endings I have seen for a romance film. Loved it so much. You'll here lots about it at awards time, so if you want in on the buzz, go see it in theaters, it is worth it.",

            "content": "So, one of the most critically acclaimed films of the last few years has hit cinemas in the UK and I don't like it... In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's pretty wank... How edgy am I right? But seriously, on paper this film should be a fully fledged 5* from me. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone reunited, it's the new film by Whiplash's director Damien Chazelle and it's a musical centred around jazz music, a blossoming love story and creative hopes and ambitions. So why, to me, does it fail at every hurdle. First off i'll talk about the positives. The production design, costume design and dance routines are certainly well crafted and pretty and we haven't seen an original musical before in quite some time on the silver screen. Obviously you have the sumptuous eye candy of both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone who are fairly decent and as it is their third time together on screen it is undeniable that they have good visual chemistry. Editing too is also creative as it was displayed in Whiplash and would expect nothing less from a picture from Chazelle. I also admire the fact that the film takes chances in story techniques regarding it's lineage and changes in perspectives which seemingly feels rare among 21st Century big budget film making. Oh! and the film has a tremendous trailers, maybe one of my favourite trailers of all time and still gives me goosebumps even though I've seen the film. \n\nHowever, laying it all on the line for you, I found the film to be one of the least engaging things i've seen and half the time I was quite frankly bored. This feeling is not from overhype or heightened expectations being let down. I went in extremely neutral and was hoping to have fun. But I just didn't and here are some of the reasons why. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone I found to be rather unlikable characters. Gosling more than Stone didn't engage with me on an emotional level and so I didn't have much investment in their plight regarding their relationship or creative endeavours. Regarding their relationship there also seemed to be the most minimal amount of effort put in, in terms of trying to develop their bond, in the form of several montages to show the passing of seasons without any actual real conversations or even visual stand out moments within the montages themselves. This gape in solid characters also didn't help the plot because there was barely any plot. That's not to say films with minimal plot are bad, but films with minimal plot HAVE TO HAVE good solid characters to keep the film afloat, otherwise you are left with a sinking ship like this. Secondly, to be a successful musical, one would assume the songs would have to be good or at least toe tap-able. Not in the case of La La Land though. What makes it worse is that the two memorable songs are featured in the trailer, so seeing the film in the hope to discover more hits leaves you dissatisfied. The constant reprise of \"City of Stars\" I also found to be rather heavy handed and made me think the creative team KNOW this is the only good song at their disposal. Lastly, the ending is quite simply insulting to the audience. I understand the juxtaposition of what Chazelle puts before us showing us two different perspectives of either follow your head or follow your heart but it is displayed with obvious bias that feels almost rude to those who might empathise with a certain path. Not to mention it undercuts the entirety of the film you've watched up until that very moment. \n\nThere are other nit-picky issues and I could go on, but those to me are the biggest faults within this apparent \"enchanting\" escapade of cinema and while I understand the complaints about the film being \"fascist\", funnily enough, that to me is the LEAST of it's problems. Now, if there's one thing people know about me is that I am a sap. A big girly sap at that. So for me to come away from this film and have this response is quite sad when I know other people really enjoy it. The film for me is the epitome of all frosting and no cake. But hey if you enjoyed it then fair fucks and if you did, please argue with me as I would like to hear someone who isn't a critic for some blog or newspaper tell me WHY this is an awards contender. So please... If you've seen it, let me know WHY I'M WRONG?? Ta thnx bbz xoxo\n\n(P.s. This film must have left the smallest impression on me because I wrote the majority of this last Friday and haven't been bothered to post it)",

She is so charming that you just can't keep your eyes off of her in every scene.\nIt's fun to hear some good jazz.  Sebastian explains, \"You can't just hear it; you have to see it.\" \nI know they must be partially or even completely manufactured, but I loved all the pretty LA sunsets. \nRyan Gosling.  Good on you.  He can do it all.  It even looks like he really played the keyboard. \nRyan and Emma Stone have great chemistry.  This is not their first movie together.\nI love the scene where they hold hands for the first time.  I remember those breath-taking moves from dates gone by.\nIt's really such a breath of fresh air. Keep those musicals coming.\nJohn Legend!\nWritten and directed by Academy Award nominee Damien Chazelle.  Nice job!\nI liked how the movie announced the seasons, reminding us how the seasons of our life come and go.\nThis film reminded me of last year's film Caf\u00e9 Society that makes you ache with love, regret, and longing.\nIs this film a love letter to Los Angeles or Hollywood or being passionate about your dreams? Or maybe all three?\nThe musical numbers easily blend into the traditional storytelling.\nThe sequence at the end was done so well.\nI didn't expect to see J.K. Simmons in a musical!\n\n\n\nThings I didn't like:\nI love Emma Stone, but I'm just wondering how much more fantastic this could have been with Anna Kendrick in the female lead role?  Maybe match her up again with Justin Timberlake like when they were together in Trolls?  Wow, can you imagine how great the soundtrack would have been?  As it is, Emma and Ryan aren't what I would call \"powerful\" singers.  If Director Chazelle was going for \"sweet and simple\", then he nailed it.\nThat string of hair that constantly droops in Sebastian's face.\nThe sound isn't always quite in sync with the lips.\nIt was funny, but also super annoying how Sebastian would honk loud and hard when he went to Mia's house and pick her up. Really?  Be a gentleman and go to the door, Bud.\nIt conjured up images of great dance numbers with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, although not nearly as good.\n\n \n\nInteresting lines:\n\"Why don't you want to do it anymore?\" - Sebastian\n\"Because I think it hurts a little too much.\" - Mia \n\nFunny lines:\n\"This idea that we're re-imagining Godilocks and the three bears from the perspective of the bears...it could be like a franchise.  There's a lot we don't know.  There could be 4 bears.  We don't know.\" - Carlo (Jason Fuchs)\n\"It's pretty strange that we keep running into each other.\" - Mia\n\"It IS strange.  Maybe it means something.\" - Sebastian\n\"I doubt it.\" - Mia\n\"Yeah, I don't think so.\" - Sebastian\n\"You're a real...um....what's the word I'm looking for?\" - Mia\n\"Knight in shining armor.\" - Sebastian\n\"Weirdo...that was the word.\" - Mia\n\n\nTips for parents: \nThis is pretty safe for all ages, but your daughters will probably enjoy it more than your sons.  It's a romantic musical after all.\n1 F-bomb; otherwise, no other profanity. \nYou see a couple living together out of wedlock.\nPlan on listening to your daughters sing these songs over and over again.\n\n\n@trinaboice",

But if that is not the case then it's almost a fact that you will love La La Land.\n\nWriter/director Damien Chazelle, hot off the acclaim of his previous film Whiplash, showcases that the precision and tenacity he displayed with that film was no fluke. La La Land is handled exceptionally from start to finish, both as an homage to musicals of the Golden Age of cinema and to modern Los Angeles, its beauty and its numerous pitfalls.\n\nRight off the bat, we're tossed into the action with a massive, jubilant opening number, that tells us we're in for a ride and to strap in. La La Land doesn't shy away from being a musical, and any skepticism I had about Chazelle's ability to balance the musical and non-musical aspects were washed away within minutes. It's the brilliant rom-com, musical hybrid we hoped we would get.\n\nStars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone show off the chemistry they've honed that have made them one of Hollywood's great on-screen couples. Singing, dancing, and acting up a storm, they prove they've earned their clout. Stone gets second billing, but she's really the star, surely on her way to a second Academy Award nomination. She commands the film with incredible range, often funny with the ability to turn on the waterworks at the drop of a dime. Gosling is as charming as ever, though not the most fleshed out character. He had motivations, he had a plot, but aside from being love struck, he lacked a ton of emotion, though that could totally be in part due to the exuberance Stone displays throughout.\n\nI could throw praise around for everyone. But even more important than Chazelle's masterful direction or Gosling and Stone's charm, is the actual music, and Justin Hurwitz deserves a trophy, a medal, a blue ribbon, every award out there because his score is spectacular. It is was carries the film into the realm of the extraordinary. It actually might be so good that it could be perceived as a detriment, and I mean that in the best way possible. It's so good it almost brings down the movie by comparison.\n\nIf this movie has any flaws, it's an over-abundance of ambition. There are a few scenes that depart the film's overall grounded tone that, while visually stunning, pulled me out of the film. I am fully aware how insane that sounds when talking about a movie where people break into impromptu song and dance, but it's an honest opinion. The story is also nothing that's going to shock or awe. It kind of falls in line with most romantic comedies.\nWhat differentiates it from most romantic comedies though it how expertly it's handled. Everything in front of and behind the camera works because it was meticulously crafted to be perfect. La La Land goes above and beyond what is expected of it, and the result is a musical everyone can fall in love with.",

They gel to such an extent, that one wonders whether this film would have made quite such an impact if the leads had been different. \nThis tale of two wannabes in LA, enduring all that Tinseltown can throw in their faces, captivates us throughout. As Mia, Stone has the weightier part to shoulder, something she does with the assurance of a seasoned actor. Whilst Gosling is so cool - so entirely likeable - that he wins us over by just rolling up his shirt sleeves and tinkering with the keys on his piano. \nThis has all the shmultz, but none of the shmutz! \nA rating seems irrelevant. If you like well-made movies with a popcorn container-full of emotion, you will love this. If not, you won't be seeing it in any case.\nIt's everything they said it is and more. Brilliant!",

When a musical is done as well as La La Land, it is hard not to like.  First, I liked the music, but I wouldn't say there was one song or number that I would want to hear repeatedly, but the quality is very high.  Next, the set pieces and backdrops are incredible.  It sure likes they did these scenes on location, and if so simply amazing.  I just was impressed by the sweeping crane shots and continuous single camera action that didn't dominate the film, but when used was extremely effective.  The opening sequence, while tacked on, is an amazing single shot.  What this movie comes down to is the relationship between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling.  These two nailed their performances, and I was was impressed with Gosling.  His piano playing I hope was real, and not sure how he could've faked it with that many tight shots of his hands.  The movie drags slightly and I wasn't crazy about the scene at the planetarium.  However, the ending for this movie is simply incredible and makes up for any flaws the film might have in my book.  This would have been a five star pick had I enjoyed the actual music more, but in this day and age of sequels and do-overs, this is such a refreshing stand alone film it is hard not to enjoy.",

            "content": "I waited 6 months to see this movie.  I love musicals, love Emma Stone, love romance.  How could I go wrong with this?  Well, first off, I really want to rate this 2 stars, but the only reason it's getting 3 from me is because there are just too many awfully depressing and boring movies getting huge praise during this awards season, and at least this film is light and airy.  La La Land may be a \"darling\" of a movie, but it's just not strong enough for a Best Picture in my opinion. It just lacked passion, true love, and real romance for me. I didn't feel it (mostly Gosling's fault).  Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are super hot and gorgeous.  Where was the passion for each other?  Heck, if Eastwood and Streep can heat up the screen in Bridges of Madison County (I know, ancient reference), then so should Stone and Gosling. I feel the writer/director (Chazelle) doesn't know (due to being young and naive maybe) how to portray that kind of romance and love that makes our hearts burst with emotion. I mean, if you watch Castaway's ending, you know what I mean by two people who've loved and lost (Hanks and Hunt).  Now that's a scene!  La La Land's ending didn't have the effect on me that it should have had (and I'm the biggest cryer, and I happened to also be PMS-ing when watching this, which would have heightened my emotions greatly). I didn't cry.  I should have.  So now let me mention also that while I understand the throwback to classic Hollywood musicals, I still wanted to see new and cool choreography.  I've seen plenty of Mandy Moore's work and I think the dance numbers were extremely \"safe.\"  Even pedestrian. I don't think Stone and Gosling even worked up a sweat (wanna see someone work up a sweat -- watch Catherine Zeta-Jones in \"Chicago\" and then tell me who kicked ass more).  I could tell that Stone could have done so much more (physically).  I really wanted to see a twist on the old and not just the old.  Yes, the sets were cool.  But the dancing and singing -- not.  Now onto the singing: both Stone and Gosling can carry a tune, but I didn't hear anything extraordinary (again, referencing Zeta-Jones in Chicago -- she sang her face off!).... Overall a disappointment for me.  I think Chazelle will go on to do greater things in Hollywood (\"Whiplash\" had a lot more passion for me!), and Stone will get her Oscar either with this movie (ugh) or a future one. She is a mega star, but I wish I saw some great stuff in this... like Viola Davis in \"Fences.\"  Sorry, but I didn't think the screenplay was strong enough to bring out those \"Oscar moments\" in the actors.  I so much wish there were quotable lines.  Wish there were scenes that just make you cry because you want these two to never stop loving each other, but there were no such scenes written or directed.  I've got more screeners to watch... let's hope I find something this award season worthy of 5 stars.",

Second, The choreography are so unison yet not too exaggerate so that brings so much energy to the audience. My favorite part is the beginning scene where the dancers are dancing in the traffic hour.Third, I have to say that picking Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as the lead role is a smart choice. Stone's acting is undoubtedly stunning as Mia Dolan, same goes to Gosling playing Sebastian. Their characters are fit together and looks funny(Remember the tap dancing scene!). On the other hand, the performance of All of Me singer, John Legend as Keith (Sebastian's friend and lead vocal of their band) is pretty good and I cannot say that Legend's appearance is not just \"an appearance\".Legend showed his skill as an actor on this movie (we know he is a very talented singer and musician). Apart from the cinematography aspects, actually the most interesting part for me is the message, when Sebastian supported Mia to stay motivated to reach her dream as an actress, which is \"If you have passion about something, just go for it and don't give up upon your dream. It is such a strong message for anybody who wants to pursue and reach their dreams, including myself. So,  I really expect in the future Hollywood will create more creative stuffs and peculiar ideas like this movie. In sum, I dare to say that La La Land is a perfect musical romantic movie that brings it's own peculiarity yet inspiring to enjoy in the end of 2016 and the early of 2017.",

Don't expect for the singers to belt a high note or expect a Step-up type of dancing and that is why I love this film, the character's imperfect singing and dancing was perfect for me because it represents their imperfect relationship but both tried to make it work and this movie works because of that.

Every musical number is filmed in single takes including its sensational opening scene where Linus Sandgren's camera swooping, swerving, weaving and flying around the performers (once of the best musical numbers ever filmed & one of the best scenes all year).\n\nThe moment it was over, the moment I wanted to see it again.\n\nLa La Land is a story about two struggling artist and dreamers, Mia an aspiring actress who serves lattes in between auditions and Sebastian a dedicated jazz musician who's trying to save the dying jazz music. Both found themselves in love, but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart.\n\nThis 31 year old dude, Damien Chazelle has masterfully crafted the usage of color, sets, costumes and music to tell an emotional story. The film uses old school techniques that were used in 1920's and 1930's to tell a contemporary story to modern audiences that doesn't feel derivative. With modern day Los Angeles as the backdrop, this film captures the beauty of the city that feels unique and magical. One of the strongest elements of the film is the orchestration, Justin Hurwitz score captures the authenticity of the story. It's playful, touching and thrilling.\n\nMia Dolan, played impeccably by Emma Stone who gives the best performance of her career. It is fun to witness how she grow in every film she's in. In this film, you won't remember her as, Stone, you'd remember her as a mature and aspiring actress. Sebastian Wilder played by (never been better) Ryan Gosling who had been practicing playing piano for months to perform several pieces in the film including the film's theme, gives an excellent performance as a struggling jazz musician aiming to save the sinking world of jazz music.\n\nLa La Land is irresistible and unforgettable piece of cinema and a wonderful gift to all movie lovers. It is brisk, spectacular and breathtakingly crafted. It is unlike any other musical movies you've seen before. La La Land is truly a musical triumph!\n\nWe don't get films like this anymore.

I would have been happy with two hours of dancing Emma Stone. On the other hand, honestly, her singing voice is weak. Talking Ryan Gosling is charming (for the most part). Dancing Ryan Gosling is OK, too. But a singing Ryan Gosling is an excruciatingly experience, which can only be described as painful. What about the music? Well, we have to make some distinctions. The non-vocal compositions are pretty good. The best singing performance is a song reserved for John Legend. When his 'band' plays on-screen, the film briefly soars as a music video. Then, there are the showtune songs, which are really not good and forgettable (one can only hope). As to the story, it is uneven. The best scene involves Emma Stone pretending to lip sync to \"I Ran\" by A Flock of Seagulls (and the best joke references said song moments later). Honestly, when the best songs with lyrics in a musical are 80s cover songs (in a pool party scene), then the showtunes component of your musical is not up to snuff. The 'conflict' brewing between the two principals two-thirds into the film is completely contrived (\"you're not following your dream\" \"No, you're not following your dream\" \"I know you're not but what am I?\"). La La Land continually hints at a charm that it fails to fully achieve, dropping it into the lower-middle tier of Hollywood musicals. So yes, La La Land is overrated. However, as a promotional film for Los Angeles tourist spots, it's quite good. Mark's Grade: C",

            "content": "\"Here's to the fools who dream\", sings an anxious Emma Stone as she auditions for her numerous role after picking herself up from a destructive Hollywood town that beats her spirits down with no remorse in the alluring film \"La La Land\". Director Damien Chazelle, has had enduring effect on the jazz films with his hypnotic  Academy Award Winning Independent film \"Whiplash\". Much like that film \"La La Land\" moves with not just breathtaking musical numbers but with as a amazing love letter to other musical films that inspired it such as Jacques Demy's \"The Umbrellas of Cherboug\" and \"The Young Girls of Rochefort\". The film however isn't like the other \"love letter films\" like Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriquez where it mimics the films that it loves then becomes its own classic. Chazelle however knows how to make his film stand out and be its own, with its colors, set pieces, its realist narrative as well as it keeps itself at  tone, its not trying to be \"meta\" or \"self-aware\". Instead the film stays confident in itself and its audience showing it's audience an original story that feels like a genuine Broadway show. The film stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as Sebastian And Mia, two L.A. artist's trying to make it in the town full of dreamers with broken dreams, one is an aspiring Jazz Musician who wants to keep the original form of jazz alive while also opening his own jazz club, while the other is an actress trying to get a role but keeps getting shut down. The film does an amazing job of keeping everything grounded in realism not being stray from showing the dark side of life in Hollywood, while it also shows this prepossessing imaginative musical numbers. Much like \"Whiplash\" this film shows the struggle of being an artist  and reconciling your dreams with the need to be human. He shows this with both characters and their drive for their passion and the floating high of what its like to be a dreamer in the modern age. Stone has been flourishing on screen since here best supporting actress role in the 2014 Academy Award Winning Best Picture \"Birdman Or The Unexpected Virtue Of Ignorance) and she doesn't shy away from it here, she has amazing chemistry with Gosling (whose character have a slight resemblance to his characters he's played in the \"TheNotebook\" as well as \"The Nice Guys\"  as if they were all from the same blood line which is perfect mix of romance and humor for this role.) the two bounce off of each other like a ball dribbling  on the basketball court. They are both humorous and love able as their sparks fly off the camera. To follow all of this up the film also has magnificent song and dance numbers, each one surpassing the other. This film is awe-aspiring, astonishing and impressive, it also is a beautiful slice of passion for jazz and thoughts of modern day music. Worth a watch 10/10.",

A musical play? forget about it.. don't get me started. Anyway, I was concerned in the first two minutes of this movie when its first large-scale choreographed number broke out \"uh oh.. here we go..\", but by the five minute mark honestly, I was completely enraptured by its splendorous genius and magic.\n\nThis is the first pretty much flawless(?) movie I can remember in recent years, from the casting to the fine line it perfectly danced (literally) between its heightened reality and pure fantasy. It was beautiful, it was funny, charming, clever and convincing. The musical numbers were the perfect length (not too long) and the songs were great. The choreography was perfectly not too over the top and over refined. It was restrained yet incredibly ambitious. it was grand but at the same time it felt very intimate and quaint at times. I was completely invested in the chemistry between Stone and Gosling. It's obvious to me why these two continue to keep working together. Really, I'm just hard pressed to find something to critique negatively about it. \n\nWhen it ended I leaned over to my girlfriend after, half choked-up I coughed out the words \"Holy shit that was good.\" (I know, I'm a romantic). Anyway, this movie is definitely now in my top 20 of all time favourite films. If this movie isn't destined to be a modern day classic than we're all just too jaded and dead inside.",

The problem I have with musicals, is that who would randomly break in to song and dance, and everybody just joins in, in perfect harmony. With this film, it does feel like you're watching an old classic romance musical, yet the songs feel like, an obscure dream of the character's. Almost how they wish they could interact with each other or how they wished they'd show their emotions through song and dance. Or another way of looking at it is, when there are happy interactions or passionate expressions from the characters, we see this metaphorical song/dance number, to reiterate how they feel.\nIt's a musical, done in a very clever and artistic way. Unlike anything I've seen before.\nI was very impressed and the story was so engaging, which probably helped. I liked it so much because I could relate with the characters. Someone that is passionate about his own art and wants to create something, to share with the world.\nI'm also not the biggest romance fan but boy, oh boy. I really got in to these two character's lives. It was a bittersweet ending, oh man. The ending! What is it, with this director? First Whiplash's ending and now this. La La Land's final scenes really pulls at your heartstrings and gives you what you want, even though it could never be in a realistic world. Which is the real difference with this film and musical's before it. This is incredibly grounded in reality, which makes it even more relatable.\nI was teetering on the edge, of giving this film 5 stars but I'd feel I'm just hyping it up. Even though, I can't actually fault the film. If you really dislike musicals, then maybe stay away. Though I think you might actually be impressed because I can't stand the likes of Grease or Into The Woods but I was really impressed and entertained with this one.",

I adore musicals - Fred and Ginger, Gene Kelly, Busby Berkeley - for me, nothing compares to the joy and escapism of masterfully delivered music, dance, cinematography and narrative, coming together in perfect harmony. When I heard there was a contemporary musical cleaning up at awards ceremonies, I couldn't wait to see it. But sadly, I felt that La La Land failed to deliver in just about all of the categories you would expect of a musical or indeed, of a basic rom-com. \nIt is no use protesting that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone aren't song-and-dance actors - if this is the case, why on earth were they cast? What they delivered was not beautiful, it was a clunky, half-hearted, uncoordinated output which, far from a homage to the golden age of the musical, was actually kind of an insult to the craft. \nOf course, that might have been forgivable if the musical numbers and narrative plot were both strong and in sync with one other but again, unfortunately, they were trite, unoriginal, dull, forgettable (I could go on and on with negative adjectives here but whatever - they were just bad, the music did not combine with the emotional story to produce an alloy of film musical. It was lazy. I was actively bored which I very rarely am in a cinema. \nThe fact that the media, the 'critics' and Hollywood generally have been singing the praises of this movie (presumably due to studio investment) demonstrates for me how deluded and corrupt the industry has become. This was not worth the price of the cinema ticket, and I'm annoyed I wasted my money based on the reviews provided. \nOh, and as one final comment (as a number of critics have noted, and with the crucial topic of diversity in mind)  if you're gonna pick a guy to 'keep jazz alive', you really ought to cast an African American in the role, no?",

Only approx.. 2 of the 12 or so songs in the show are used in the typically musical fashion. This may have made the movie more palatable for less musically-inclined audience members, but it took a bit of the charm from the experience for me.  The music itself was also underwhelming, particularly in the warble of the ever-handsome Ryan Gosling. The dancing, however, of both Stone and Gosling was beautiful and their precision and talent in execution was clear- lots of work went in to this movie, all well worth the end product. \n\tDespite this disappointment, La La Land remained charming to the utmost and I left the theater spinning, wishing only to return to that colorful and dramatic City of Stars.",

Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling once again have amazing chemistry with the romance aspect of the story, but the romance isn't the best part of this movie. The passion these two characters have for their dreams is the best part of this movie. La La Land also has an amazing soundtrack. As soon as I got home from my viewing I immediately purchased the soundtrack on vinyl, it's that good. Overall, La La Land is a modern day masterpiece with amazing music, direction, performances, and visuals. I strongly recommend this movie, by far my favorite movie of 2016.",

Alot of the cinematography in this movie was really good as well.  The intro scene on the highway, as cheesy as it was, was really well done and looked really good. Also, the scene that appears to be referenced in the movie poster to my immediate left was beautifully shot.  The single light pole on the street with the cityscape in the background is just beautiful. This movie had really good colors.  Someone obviously thought consciously about alot of the color schemes in the wardrobes. I didn't think the movie was perfect though.

Too much bland emotional drama - emotions are important, however this experiment of a \"movie\" showcases a cheesy, boring atmosphere in fantasy that is just not relevant and lacks any sort of emotional or substantive content.\n\n3. The end of the movie - yes, it's a bit surprising, however, it DOESN'T MATTER! The whole movie is based around cheesy emotional drama and the idea of time being taken back only randomly appears near the end. I believe the ending is even worse than the rest of the movie simply because they pretend that there is somewhere else to take this movie other than the feel good emotional .\n\n There is one good thing about the movie - the music is very well produced (but again, it only suits the movie for the style they achieved - which is the lame style that has no purpose other than to emotionally attach and release.",

            "content": "Hot damn, Damien Chazelle knows how to end a movie. Whiplash, the best movie of 2014, ended with one hell of a bang, a rebellious drumming extravaganza that hit an insane number of climactic character beats while also working incredibly well of sheer spectacle alone. Chazelle's latest, La La Land, similarly sticks the landing, and its final ten minutes left me an absolute wreck. In that final act, Chazelle brings together two hours of somewhat meandering story and turns what looks like a curtain call into an emotional crescendo. If you subscribe to the school of moments-make-a-movie, La La Land is probably the best picture of the year. But while the rest of the movie builds beautifully to that last hurrah, its less engaging than one might expect, with most of the musical numbers working just well enough and the plot mechanics feeling all too familiar.\n\nLa La Land opens with a big musical number, as commuters hop out of their cars in L.A. to sing a sunny ditty about their dreams to make it big, putting a smile on their professional anxiety. It's a fun sequence, if not a bit over-hyped, but after that and an opening number for Stone at a Hollywood party, La La Land turns into much less of a theatrical musical than advertised. It wouldn't be a Chazelle film without a reliance on music, but only on four or so occasions throughout does it call on its characters to sing (at least in a non-diegetic fashion; on a related note, word of the day: Diegesis). This might disappoint some of the musical theater fans out there, but it works for the film. In their first real meeting, stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone get to connect through singing in an adorable and adorably rickety meet-cute (they aren't quite Rogers and Astaire). But their second big coupley moment is entirely instrumental, and finds Chazelle at his most directorially creative. And it works perfectly for Gosling and Stone, who have an immediate chemistry that the entire film is built around. Stone in particular fleshes out a familiar character type in interesting ways, becoming the true beating heart of the film.\nLa La Land is nakedly in love with the past, and some of its more interesting moments come from mixing old-fashioned tropes with the new (such as key fob woes translating to spontaneous tap dancing). Chazelle also has occasional unromanticized streaks, letting his camera focus on the cracked sidewalks that could come from anywhere in the world (and, you know, that whole traffic jam musical number). But this is a movie where an attempt to modernize jazz is mocked (if not utterly dismissed), and Chazelle seems to take that sentiment to heart. While it modernizes some old tropes, it doesn't reinvent them, and comes up a bit short of a revolution (which is a lot to ask of any movie, but the buzz around La La Land earns the request). It takes more time in the middle than it should, and by the end, maybe believes in the dream of Hollywood a bit too much itself. While not as optimistic as its cast of commuters, this is certainly a less cynical film than Whiplash was. But, once again, I keep coming back to that final act in my head. Even if its a bit of an uneven journey, the destination is an absolute triumph.",

            "content": "Mia (Emma Stone) is a wannabe actress who works in a coffee shop on a movie studio lot in Los Angeles. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz pianist who dreams of opening his own L.A. jazz club but has to play gigs with an eighties cover band to make ends meet. After a series of wild coincidences in which they repeatedly run into each other, they start dating, fall in love, and become each other's biggest cheerleaders.\n \nThey also break into song and dance at regular intervals, because, in case you haven't heard, \"La La Land\" is a musical. Though I'm no expert, in the opinion of my untrained ears, Gosling's singing is on par with that of a sports star making a music video -- not cringe-inducing, but not the caliber of voice you'd expect to hear in a musical. He's no Fred Astaire either, which oddly helps even things out, like he's just some regular guy who happened to walk onto the movie set.\n\nFortunately, I wasn't there for the singing and dancing - in fact, I find random singing and dancing to be an awkward distraction, whether in movies or in real life. In the opening scene, traffic is backed up on a freeway on-ramp and all of these actors and actresses start get out of their cars and start singing and dancing and all I could think about was the hundreds of regular people who were probably stuck in traffic behind them. \n\nThere's another scene where Mia and Sebastian go to some planetarium after hours but somehow they're able to get inside and naturally they start dancing and I'm obsessing over whether perhaps it's an open-air planetarium or how they got in when suddenly out of nowhere they start levitating and then they're dancing in mid-air, and I then I realized ohhh, I guess anything goes because this is a musical. (Coincidentally, Google just confirmed that \"Anything Goes\" is also the name of a musical. Thought so.)\n\nBut this didn't stop me from puzzling over the fact that even if one could levitate because of magical musical gravity-defiance rules, it doesn't make sense to actually waltz in mid-air since you couldn't actually push off to twirl and stuff. I know I was probably supposed to be thinking \"oh gee, isn't this oh so magical and whimsical and romantic\" and maybe I did for about a nanosecond but the scene went on a whole lot longer than that.\n \nTo be fair, it's not just song and dance numbers that cause my mind to wander off trying to amuse itself. I'm equally mystified by the supposed entertainment value of car chases and fight scenes. \n\nThat said, the fact that this is a musical didn't bother me as much as I thought would. Most of the dialogue is spoken, not sung, and the musical interludes seem to be concentrated more in the beginning. \n\nMy favorite scenes were Mia's comically bad failed auditions. Stone was tremendous throughout the film and deserves any awards they throw her way. I also liked the last ten minutes very much - more than the entire rest of the movie. And I liked the soundtrack.\n\nI'd be lying if I said I don't see what all of the hubbub is about. \"La La Land\" is good clean entertainment, the sort of thing you can take your grandmother to. All of the dazzling on-location shots and vivid colors and swelling music belie the fact that the story itself is rather bland and the characters are thinly-sketched. \n\nThough I only saw this movie because it was the only convenient thing playing in the oddball 5pm time slot, I liked it better than I thought I would. The 2+ hours didn't fly by, but nor did they seem like an eternity. I was mildly entertained throughout. I'm glad I saw if only because it spares me having to listen to people telling me I have to see it. But I have no desire to see it again, not even for free. Not even for a small stipend. \n\nIs it deserving of all the hype? No. But it won't kill you to go with your wife or grandma or friend who is only available to see a movie at 5pm. If you're bored, you can put your time to good use by contemplating the laws of physics as they apply to dancers with truly amazing hang-times.",

Eisner declared at the 1989 opening of the then-Disney MGM Studios. \"Not a place on a map,\" he continued, \"but a state of mind that exists wherever people dream and wonder and imagine.\" He concluded his remarks by welcoming all to \"a Hollywood that never was-and always will be.\" Eisner very easily could have been describing the world created by Damien Chazelle in the new musical, La La Land. Not since Singin' in the Rain, has the magic and essence of Hollywood been so effectively captured on film.\nSimply stated, La La Land is a masterpiece; a stunning sensation for the senses, both visually and audibly. It's a whimsical tale about two ordinary people with extraordinary dreams, achievable because of the effects that a series of chance encounters they share with one another has on each of them.\nAs the film opens, audiences are transported to a musical world in which drivers, stuck for hours in one of Los Angeles' infamous traffic jams, abandon their vehicles for song and dance in the kind of ensemble performance that's all too rare in today's motion pictures. It's on this LA freeway that Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a down-on-his luck jazz purist and pianist, and Mia (Emma Stone), an ever-auditioning, aspiring actress, first meet, as Mia flips an annoyed, horn-honking Sebastian the bird while he cuts her off. After a few more false starts and a little flirtatious banter, the chemistry between the two builds to the point of becoming almost tangible.\nEventually, against a sunset sky specially crafted for lovers, Mia and Sebastian sing and dance their way into each other's hearts. Despite their initial belief that such \"A Lovely Night\" is wasted on two people who could not be more incompatible, through a tit for tat tap dance, they begin to recognize that when working together, the routine is stronger than when apart. Each recognizes the potential for greatness in the other, while doubting the potential residing within themselves.\nWhile neither Gosling nor Stone have the vocal or rhythmic talent of Astaire or Rogers, that works to their advantage. Their performances provide the audience an opportunity to see themselves in their characters; we feel as though anyone could sing and tap dance in front of the Hollywood hills at sunset and be a star. That's not to take away from either performer, however, as both were nothing short of mesmerizing. Still, there's a sort of humility that they portray that, when coupled with the simplicity of the choreography and of the lyrics, provides Gosling and Stone a special kind of charm.\nEqually as mesmerizing as the film's co-stars is Justin Hurwitz's score. In recent years, so often music seems to be nothing more than an afterthought in the filmmaking process. Not so in La La Land, where it often feels as though the film were constructed around Hurwitz's melodies. In what may be the most memorable scene of the movie, the score quite literally soars through the star-filled skies of Hollywood along with a waltzing Stone and Gosling. There's such an elegance and timeless quality to the scene; save for technology, it could very easily have been filmed during Hollywood's golden years, and deserves to go down in history as one of the most memorable scenes of any movie musical. Hurwitz is definitely a composer to watch for in the future.\nHollywood itself also takes centerstage in La La Land. The City of Los Angeles has never looked so stunning. Chazelle fills the city with bold, vibrant colors, evoking imagery of Hollywood at her prime. This is the sort of backdrop that dreams are made of; it's not at all hard to imagine Humphrey Bogart or Katharine Hepburn walking these streets. It's fitting, considering the movie as a whole serves as a reminder that Hollywood is a city built on dreams.\nTherein lies the brilliance of this picture. Just as Hollywood is a city of dreams, La La Land is a movie of dreams. In an era of cynicism, La La Land reminds us of the joy and beauty that can be found in everyday life. It reminds us of the power of friendship and love, and of the difference that one person can make in the life of another. And it does it all through beautiful imagery, song, and dance. In La La Land, every day is a dream come true, and despite the difficulties they face, Sebastian and Mia live life as though it is a dream. Perhaps here in the real-world, we should strive to live that way as well.",

They take you out of your every day mundane life and transport you to another realm, another dimension and you get lost feeling like you are in a fairy tale.  Go see it at the theatre.

Audacious, retro, funny and heartfelt, La La Land is the latest great musical for people who don't like musicals - and will slap a mile-wide smile across the most miserable of faces. Utterly magnificent and intoxicating. Chazelle's script is hopeful and sweet and clever and rich. His direction is innovative and captivating. Gosling is terrific as the coolly introspective yet disarmingly charming Sebastian. And Stone is deservedly generating Oscar buzz for her portrayal of an artist who can't quite believe she'll ever be anything other than a barista. The fact that neither Stone nor Gosling are tip-top song-and-dance artists is, in some ways, integral to their appeal. If they were Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, we might not feel as much of a kinship with them. It's a beautiful and hopeful film, coming at a time when there isn't much beauty or hope in our movies, and it's the type of picture - a sprawling, exuberant musical drama - that hasn't been seen in decades. Damien Chazelle's musical, consistently daring and occasionally sublime, does what the movies have all but forgotten how to do - sweep us up into a dream of love that's enhanced in an urgent present by the mythic power of Hollywood's past.\n\nVERDICT: \"Instant Classic\" - [Positively Acclaimed Reaction] Usually I give this rating to a movie that I believe is absolutely outstanding and has little to no flaws in it. Audiences, who haven't seen this film, must see it right now! (Films that are rated 4.5 or 5 stars)",

I'd been waiting for this movie for more than a year, may be since i heard that Emma and Ryan were doing a musical together. Mind you i'm in love with the three of them. I had read all the critics all the interviews and opinions, so may be i was apprehensive and anxious at the same time. \nWell, let me tell you something, it did surprised me far more that i could have anticipated. The music and cinematography are sublime, Chazelle directed a movie with the same tempo its central piece of music has. A dashing and exhilarating opening number that keeps up it pace till it suddenly  becomes quiet, still that has you on edge knowing that somehow it pick up again its quick pace towards the ending, that it will grow toward its heartbreaking, breathtaking finale. Its a dance of emotions and feelings, a fairy tale of dreams and reality, and i could not be more glad. \nI think Ryan is superb, but in my honest opinion, the very star of this movie is the music and Emma. She is astounding in every scene, quite particularly in her auditions. She slides through a range of emotions in mere seconds, she is a breath of fresh air in every scene, funny and quirky, and i think that with that monologue in Birdman, its the very best i've seen of her.\nI can understand why people may not like it, but i can only be thankful that i went out of the theatre with my heart so full of love for music and old classics, an movies, and stories that are not afraid to make you feel, not only laugh and sing, but also cry and hurt. I can only wait to see how will this months unfold, but i can say, that it only gets better with every time you see it",

To me, the movie is more a series of set pieces or music videos of varying quality that mostly improves as the movie progresses. Gosling and Stone are good onscreen together, and there are a few great songs in there. But if you don't lover all musicals, there are a few problems. \n\nThe opening sequence is nonsensical. The song where they meet is weak, complex, and just didn't work for me (nor those I was with during the viewing). The scene after midnight in the planetarium was uneven, illogical, and jarring. The scene of them dancing in the stars was just stupid and inconsistent with the rest of the film. \n\nHowever, the rest of it was magical. I laughed, I cried, and I was transported by the cinema. It's very difficult to write great songs and strong stories and cast great actors to pull off a movie musical. It was a goof effort. O look forward to further work from these artists.",

You feel everything they do, love every high and lament every low, but through it all the film is about that very greatest of things: Dreams. Not necessarily achieving them, but how important it is to have them in the first place, to always give us something to aim for and strive to accomplish. It may be heavy at times and not always as cheery as the critical consensus would have you believe, but it's very rare to find a film that can truly pick you up as much as this one does, and from the opening musical number to the closing credits, it's a film you won't be able to tear your eyes, ears and heart away from.",

Honestly, going into this movie I didn't know an awful lot, I certainly didn't know it would be a musical, I just thought it would be about music like Damien Chazzelle's last movie Whiplash (which I loved). So when the first scene began with the huge dance number and singing, I wasn't sure how the whole movie would pan out. But as it went on, I realised it wasn't just a bog-standard musical cringe-fest, it was incredible storytelling with a musical slid in which was fantastic. I don't usually like musicals but this one is in a league of its own and it's brilliant. DO NOT miss out on this one; Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are flawless in their singing, acting and dancing. My favourite aspect of the movie was that it didn't lose grips with reality, if you've seen the movie you should know what I mean if you were looking out for it. Things like Ryan and Emma about to kiss while sat in the movie theatre with the romantic music playing in the background but then the screen breaks which ruins the moment, in a normal musical moment they would have just kissed but as I sad before this movie is so much more than a bog-standard musical. Another moment that doesn't lose grips with reality was when Emma and Ryan did their dance number together as seen on the poster looking over LA, they are both dancing together brillaintly being all romantic again but then Emma's phone rings and the whole dance number stops and goes back to reality. Just really great direction from Damien Chazelle once again.",

La La Land is one of the most fun and entertaining movies I have seen in a long time. The acting was lovely, the music was superb, and the direction was flawless. The film manages to expertly balance the feel-good homage to Old Hollywood with the genuine moments of \"real life.\" It was an excellent piece of cinema that gave me enough warm-and-fuzzy moments to last the rest of the month, and it proved yet again that superb writer/director Chazelle is not going anywhere.",

I'm not criticizing Gosling or Stone -- I think they both made lemonade, though neither seemed particularly confident as either singer or dancer.  Each provided a journeyman's performance.  John Legend's performance was similarly competent, though I thought casting that particular musician for that part seemed a bit gratuitous.  After reading the glowing reviews and watching  as the film garnered numerous awards, I was disappointed by the actual product.  At best, it was mediocre.  My grading scale is based on ticket price.  Really good films are worth a full-price ticket, on my scale (five stars).  Awful films, by contrast, are worthy only of late-night re-run showings on local access television (zero stars).

She makes you feel her pain, joy, uncomfortableness, and love throughout the film.  Gosling is also a great actor, but what really stood out is how accomplished he is at being a jazz pianist. The music throughout the film was great and I especially loved hearing the old school jazz.  But, what I really loved more than anything, was how Damian Chazelle directed/shot this movie. The colors, the storyline, the cuts, the beautiful wide shots, and those fine detail shots that were like metaphors of their relationship were so spot on and thoughtful, that it makes this film a must see. The only snare for me was the ending.... I know there is a reality to the storyline there, but it puts a bit of downer and sadness as you walk away on what was a very uplifting film. But the ending doesn't take away from the beautiful direction and the incredible acting, so go see it and enjoy a film that stands apart from today's crowd of hollywood formula movies.

Making art, like making love, requires as an essential ingredient the willingness to be vulnerable, and it is Stone's brave vulnerability (both in her performance, and in her performances-within-the-performance) that anchors \"La La Land\"s most compelling scenes, hitting its most winning, poignant notes (figuratively--the singing from the leads is merely OK, but the rest of the film is executed with such panache that it doesn't matter; see: \"Moulin Rouge\" for another example of this).\n\nA film that's easy to root for in a genre that recalls the glories of yesteryear Hollywood, if \"La La Land\" (as seems likely) cleans up at the Oscars at the expense of a few other movies that are a little bit better, that's OK. It's an excellent picture.",

            "content": "Now three weeks have passed and I have seen 25 films at Cannes, most of them attempts at greatness, and I sit here staring at the computer screen and realizing with dread that the time has come for me to write a review justifying that vertical thumb, which is already on video and will go out to millions of TV viewers seeking guidance in their moviegoing.\n\nI do not say that I was wrong about the film. I said what I sincerely believed at the time. I believed it as one might believe in a good cup of coffee; welcome while you are drinking it, even completely absorbing, but not much discussed three weeks later. Indeed after my immersion in the films of Cannes, I can hardly bring myself to return to \"The Longest Yard\" at all, since it represents such a limited idea of what a movie can be and what movies are for.\n\nYet there are those whose entire lives as moviegoers are spent within the reassuring confines of such entertainments. In many cities and some states, there are few ways for them to get their eyes on movies that can feed their souls. They will have to be content with a movie in which Adam Sandler plays an alcoholic has-been football hero who gets drunk, drives dangerously, is thrown into jail and becomes the pawn in a football game pitting a team of fellow prisoners against a team made up of prison guards. As I sit here, so help me God, I can't remember who got the idea for this game or why. I could look it up, but it's fascinating to watch myself trying to reconstruct a movie that was not intended to be remembered as long as it takes to get to the parking lot. This is how you learn. Through experience.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI recall that for some reason the big game is broadcast live on a sports network, maybe because the Sandler character was once a football hero and went down in flames over the drunk-driving scandal, and so there is a possibility of good ratings. His mentor is a former prisoner, played by Burt Reynolds, who starred in Robert Aldrich's original \"Longest Yard\" (1974) and whose character this time is described in my notes as the Heisman Trophy Winner of 1955. Assuming my notes are correct, he was about 21 when he won the trophy and it is 2005 now, so that makes Reynolds about 71, although now that I have done the math I don't know where to go with it. Certainly he is older than Sandler and younger than God.\n\nJames Cromwell plays the warden. I have met him on industry occasions. He is a militant Screen Actors' Guild spokesman and a fiercely intelligent man who takes roles like this for the same reason I review them, because we are professionals and this is what we do. He would rather be in better movies and I would rather review them, but we have both seen a lot worse than this. There is a sense in which attacking this movie is like kicking a dog for not being better at calculus.\n\nYou think you know where I am headed. I am going to admit that I was wrong. I am going to withdraw that upturned thumb even as its ghostly video image beams out across the nation. I will compare it to the shimmering authority of a hologram of Obi-Wan Kenobi, expressing wisdom that was true enough when the hologram was recorded, but may not be helpful by the time it is seen.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut no, I am not going to do that at all. When the show was recorded I said what I believed, and for my sins I am appending three stars to the top of this review. I often practice a generic approach to film criticism, in which the starting point for a review is the question of what a movie sets out to achieve. \"The Longest Yard\" more or less achieves what most of the people attending it will expect. Most of its audiences will be satisfied enough when they leave the theater, although few will feel compelled to rent it on video to share with their friends. So, yes, it's a fair example of what it is.\n\nI would however be filled with remorse if I did not urge you to consider the underlying melancholy of this review and seek out a movie you could have an interesting conversation about. I have just come from 12 days at Cannes during which several times each day I was reminded that movies can enrich our lives, instead of just helping us get through them.\n\nIt may be that your local multiplex is not showing any films that have, or will, or would, qualify for Cannes. There is a studied unwillingness among the major distributors to rise very frequently above the lowest common denominator, except during Oscar season. But there are actually some very worthy films in national release right now. If \"Kontroll\" is playing in your town, for example, that would be an idea. Or \"Brothers,\" or \"Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist,\" or \"Layer Cake,\" or \"Unleashed.\" These are not great films, you understand, but they exist in a world that knows what greatness is, and they urge themselves toward it. If you can get to \"Crash,\" that is the movie you must see, and you should immediately drop any thought of seeing anything else instead.",

Emma Stone continues her rise to Hollywood superstardom in this film. Her eyes tell most of the story. It is easy to empathize with her character, to root for her character. A wannabe actress/barista that goes from audition to audition always losing out to girls she thinks are prettier or more talented. She meets another dreamer, Ryan Gosling's character, a wannabe jazz club owner. I expected their to be more singing between the two of them, that was a disappointment. Their chemistry seems forced at times, but their playfulness is infectious. I can see many movie goers not liking the ending but appreciating it. The acting gets an A, the singing gets a C-, the fantasy of it all gets an A+! I don't see Best Picture in its future but I do see a ton of Oscar nominations.",

The dancing was sub par compared to the spectacular performances musical theater goers are used to seeing on a regular basis. I am a fan of both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, but one can only do so much with a bad script and bad songs. I appreciate that neither are strong singers but it was going to take more than a strong voice to make the songs in this movie bearable. The story makes actors, musicians, and \"dreamers\" seem like vapid morons. La La Land was advertised as a \"love letter\" to Hollywood. Instead it was the entertainment industry masturbating on screen for two hours. Definitely the most overrated movie of 2016.

Everything else is bad, the songs sound the same when you hear the cheesy number in the first 2 minutes of the film, you have pretty much heard the soundtrack, its joyous for the most part but the ending is depressing. If I wanted that, I would watch Les Miserables. Its also far too long, it felt like a 3 hour film not a 2 hour film. The dance routines all feel samey and offer nothing new and I hated the use of the handheld camera to give the illusion of a long one shot. The only saving grace is the fact that I love both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and they do their very best. For me I knew I was going to hate it from the opening song and hate it I did.

I have to appreciate that if you don't like muscials at all then it probably won't be your thing, and if you expect a musical that is nothing but the world's best singing for 1.5 hours then it won't be your thing either, but that isn't the point of this film. The story line is brilliant (not giving spoilers) and honest, whilst the singing and dancing is not top notch I feel like this is a good thing as it adds a certain purity to it and sense of spontaneity rather than manufactured and over-rehearsed glee. Emma Stone is absolutely phenomenal and I would expect her to be in contention at the Oscars. Most of all this film just has so much heart and soul in it, and you can't help but leave feeling like you've been on an emotional rollercoaster ride with a backing track of really catchy songs.

So I was very much anticipating director Chazelle's return to the big screen with La La Land, a decided change-of-pace that is getting almost universal acclaim, and rightfully so. Where Whiplash was an intense drama about ambition and loneliness within the jazz world, La La Land is bright musical about ambition and loneliness within Hollywood. Fully embracing the constructs of old-fashioned Astaire / Rogers pictures while floating them effortlessly into the 21st century, it's a joyous song-and-dance rom-com that dances far beyond its pretenses.\nGosling and Stone are phenomenal, playing two wide-eyed dreamers looking to make something of their artistic abilities. With the lovely romantic melancholy of Once, the dreamlike song numbers of Singin' in the Rain, and the character motivations of each, the film wraps itself around our nostalgia before nudging us out of our familiar comfort. The songs are lyrically moving and ready-made for Broadway, and the sets and dances accompanying them would be considered experimental if they weren't so charmingly classic.\nIf it seems like La La Land skates by on its charisma, think again. Playing effectively with the line between romance and reality, both in relationships and in aspirations, it asks us if one is inherently better than the other, and is it truly possible to have both? In our search for purpose, must we apologize for every mistake, or can we accept them & even love them? To quote one song directly, \"Here's to the messes we make.\" That's where true love is found. That's where life is found.",

However his part in this film is strictly limited compared to his performance in Whiplash.\nThe plot basically is set in present day Los Angeles and surrounds a jazz musician Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) who through random events develops a relationship with Mia (Emma Stone) an aspiring actress.\nThey both have dreams of fulfilling careers. For Sebastian or Seb it is jazz music and opening his own jazz bar (surprisingly called Sebs), for Mia it is becoming a well known stage/film actress.\nTo achieve there dreams they have to live apart and drift apart. Mia getting married and having a child in the process.\nThe film reminded me of Fame with random acts of dancing and singing in the most inappropriate places (a LA traffic jam?). The part musical genre is just not suited to me perhaps!\nI say musical. I was confused at times what this film was trying to be. Part musical, part comedy, part love story.\nThe lead actors put in good performances but the architecture of the screenplay left me lost.

It tells a story about of Sebastian played by Ryan Gosling and Mia played by Emma Stone, Sebastian wants to be a Jazz musician and Mia wants to be famous Hollywood actress and the way they told this story was so unique and well down. This is a musical movie and I'm not a fan of musicals but this one really worked for me, the music in this had a lot of meaning to the story and it's about dreams and going after what you're passionate about and it doesn't go in a way you thought it would.\n\nOverall, I love this movie it's funny, heartwarming, smart and beautiful. I thought the writing, the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the story, the chemistry, the performance and the music was incredible. I felt that I was watching a 50's movie in the modern day. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were great together on screen. This is Emma Stone's best performance she's given since her last movie Birdman. La La Land is gonna get a lot of Oscar nominations. Go and see this movie as soon as possible I highly recommend it. This is in my top five favorite movies of 2016.",

I'll be honest and say I don't really like musicals. I do like the 1940/50s ones and this one certainly tried to capture that. The acting and such was mostly terrific but the music left me annoyed. I'm told that Ryan Gosling practiced for four whole months for his part as a struggling jazz musician and his playing shows why he is struggling. I have to wonder if he'd practice for four whole months and then try to play Chopin. The idea seems to be that Jazz is easy. Other jazz in the movie are not only good, they are damn good but when Gosling plays it is obvious you are listening to an amateur who has memorized some good player's riffs. The dialogue about jazz is right on, but Gosling should have faked it. Most of the other music is cute, but not really memorable. There are a couple of really good pieces, 'City of Stars' for one, but I kept thinking how much better they were be with better singers. All that is nit picking I guess but I just found that given all the hype this would be much better. Look I have friends who's (or is it whose?) opinions I value who disagree with me and they are as much right as I am. So don't pass this up because I didn't like it, I'm too picky about Jazz anyway. Overall a well done movie and a good experience. You can expect to see this in the awards but I have to scratch my head on that.",

Chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. \n\nHowever, it's the stories about its production and its director that make me like this film even more.\n\nThe director was a drummer and drew from experience and favorite inspiration to direct this movie.\n\nHe was persistent. He had the theme and script for this movie since 2010, but because it was about jazz which no distributors / studios liked (the same sentiment toward jazz was also used in the movie), and he wasn't famous, he folded and kept this dream within him while working on other films. Eventually when he had a big success from another movie, *Whiplash*, that's when people started to take him seriously about his idea of *La La Land*, with the theme of paying homage to people who risk it all to have a success in neck-breaking competitive environment in Hollywood, and \"*to take the old musical but ground it in real life where things don't always exactly work out*\". The bittersweet ending is what makes this movie so great, because that's real life that everybody can relate to, not some perfect love story that you *wish* it'd come true.\n\nI respect the director Damien Chazelle a lot that he didn't compromise to fulfill his dream. Initially, a studio offered to finance his film but they wanted heavy alterations. Jazz. Nah. Change to rock. Bittersweet also had to be dropped. Instead of compromising, Damien moved on until he was presented with a perfect opportunity years later. Persistence in action.\n\nI appreciate the process of recruiting and training the lead actor and actress. Ryan Gosling had no prior experience in piano, neither did Emma Stone in dancing, so both had to learn from scratch just to shoot the film. Both of them drew from the experience to act so realistically in the film too. Emma remembered when she kept getting rejected from so many auditions, and Ryan told the story of him getting interrupted with conversation about lunch while he emoted passionately -- a scene ended up in the movie which Emma acted.\n\nOverall, this is a masterpiece that has great stories both within and behind the scenes. Entertaining and inspiring. Easily 5 stars.",

Every character had the unpracticed voice of someone auditioning for a high school play. The instrumental soundtrack, though, was phenomenal. This movie makes me want to find all those jazz greats on vinyl and listen to them on repeat. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have chemistry, which is not a surprise from how many movies they've been cast for together. We get tied up in their hopes and dreams; we feel when they fail. Then that ending nearly ruined all my good feelings for the film. It's as it they thought the ending they've been building up to, that they've set the stage for, is too easy...so they throw it in the dumpster outside. We leave wondering why in the heck they even wrote and filmed an ending at all if that's what they were going to give us. \n\nMy final verdict is to see this movie. The cinematography and acting is stunning, so focus on that and let the ending fade from your memory entirely.",

In many ways, I didn't want to enjoy La La Land, bracing myself for ways to criticize this film that's received a ridiculous amount of critical acclaim. Suffice to say, I walked out of the theater with tears in my eyes and my tail between my legs. La La Land is by no means a perfect film, but it is damn near close. \n\nThe opening number of La La Land was everything I initially expected of the film--a gushy, colorful, euphoric mess. I was convinced I'd be annoyed for the remaining 2 hours, before being blindsided and proven completely wrong. In all honesty, La La Land is at its best when it isn't a playing the part of a musical--partially due to the fact that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling aren't the best singers. (Ryan should probably stick to his awesome, spooky Halloween band and low baritone.) The two are an emotional tour de force in La La Land, which was a much unexpected surprise inbetween so many whimsical musical numbers. \n\nLa La Land is the epitome of artistic expression and escapism as much as it is a cinematic embodiment of aspiration, growth, love, and heartbreak. It starkly contrasts beauty with grit, comicality with sorrow, and dreams with solemn reality. La La Land is a bittersweet beauty, and I was wrong to ever doubt it.",

So, take that in consideration when I say that I did not hate La La Land, which has become the most celebrated film of award season 2016 and has been hailed as a revival of sorts for Golden Age era musicals.  Part of the reason I was okay with La La Land may lie in the fact that there aren't as many musical numbers as there are in other musical films.  It has just enough pleasant, entertaining song and dance tunes to keep that crowd happy and just enough story and you know...acting to keep someone like me from walking out.  I would argue that Land has more in common with old school melodrama pictures than it does a musical of that same period, but that's just me.  Anyway, La La Land focuses around two 20-something hopefuls living in L.A.  Emma Stone is a barista trying to audition to become an actress, while Ryan Gosling is a pianist who wishes to revive pure old school jazz and open a club displaying it.  Stone is the MVP here, doing most of the emotional heavy lifting, and doing it effortlessly.  Gosling's character seems to be more the absurd and insufferable one at first, but as the movie progresses, he turns out to be the more practical person.  \n\nOf course, this movie is rooted in starry-eyed romance and yes, Stone and Gosling have the kind of chemistry that will get general audiences to buy tickets, when they normally might avoid this kind of fare.  It's a generally pleasant movie, but it becomes quite heartbreaking and bittersweet toward the end.  The last ten minutes proves gut wrenching as both characters view what may have been and what will never be.  I thought it was alright, which says all you need to know for this one.  Though I do think that if the media and entertainment press sincerely thinks that this movie is the best of the year and will lead to a revival of musicals, then it is they who are living in La La Land.",

            "content": "Damien Chazelle's joyous, unabashedly romantic modern musical about hopeful dreamers in Los Angeles. Ryan Gosling is a jazz pianist with ambitions of opening his own club. Emma Stone is a coffee-shop waitress and struggling actress. The movie opens with an exuberant, improbable song and dance number, \"Another Day of Sun,\" on an LA freeway where Gosling and Stone first meet. This sequence is filmed in one seemingly unbroken shot and is filled with so much gaiety that it sustains you throughout the movie. Chazelle has made an original, romantic musical comedy with the vibrant colors and lyricism that reminds you of Jacques Demy's \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.\" The dances are funny and beautiful and shot in fluid long takes. Gosling is more alive and affecting than usual. He tampers down on that Steve McQueen nonchalance. Stone is a charming, lightly self-mocking comedienne but she's never been as lovely, graceful, and touching as she is here. It goes on too long as the romance fades but there is a concluding passage that shows what might've been that is almost peerless in its poignancy. Written and directed by Chazelle.

Too bad they spent so much time on the bland story about two bland people trying to be \"pure\" and \"follow their dreams\" in the blandest possible way.  Light fun until the filmmakers start to indulge in annoying power games at the end.  A high-budget but failed attempt to bring new life to the tradition of musicals.  Highly derivative music, unexciting plot-line, and WAY to much face time with the cute stars being cute and semi-tragic without any real sense of drama and zero sexuality.  I recommend first spending time re-watching the old classics or newer musicals like Hedwig or Chicago to get a modern spin on the genre.  This is just cloying movie fodder, nothing special except for the high-budget effects and pretty face on Emma.  And you can get sick of that too when they shove the camera into it for the five-milionth time.",

            "content": "When you look around to see what kind of movies are coming out today, you're mostly going to see stupid (but crowd pleasing) action thrillers, very poorly written party comedy movies, pointless money grabbing remakes and a handful of top notch biopics and drama films. Notice how movie musical was not included. What happened to them? Not counting biopics, I believe the last movie musical was Chicago (2002). So what do we have here? We have a delightful new, original musical which recently swept the golden globes and which, if you're like me, probably need to see twice in the theaters. We already are familiar with the boy meets girl premise, and we're familiar with the great chemistry Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling share. However, Damien Chazelle reinvents the movie musical and that premise and makes it brand new. Sure, they're no Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, but think about it. When was the last time you were tapping your foot and smiling so much during a musical since Chicago? When was the last time you saw tap dancing? Dancer in the dark? (I know I said that was the worst musical and movie ever made, but since there was no music playing at that point, I mildly enjoyed that part) You will hear from some people that this movie is overrated. That is coming from people who were expecting it to be like Chicago, or even pitch perfect. Yes, it doesn't have much story. Yes, there's only two real scenes of dancing. Yes, the music and lyrics aren't Broadway quality. However, what's there is excellent. I will admit, I thought pitch perfect was just a little overrated, but believe the hype this movie is getting. Watch it and escape into a fantasy world you haven't seen since 2002. Oh yeah, and it's styled like a musical from the 30s to the 60s, so it'll provide some real nostalgia. Best movie of 2016!",

The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is amazing, they really work and you buy them as a couple. The choreography is great. Mandy Moore knows how to make the movement as light and elegant as possible, further emerging you in the story. I loved this film. It was directed beautifully. The acting was great.

Still, I am a Ryan Gosling fan- he is amazing as usual and even became quite an accomplished pianist just for the film, in keeping with his abnormally immersive acting style, and the film delivers a much-needed dose of lightness at a rather heavy time in our national history.  Plus, it's great to see the musical genre  brought into the 21st-century.",

Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a struggling jazz pianist, playing small venues.  His dream is to open his own jazz club.  The two meet, but don't hit it off.  Over time, however, things change...\n\nI generally dislike musicals and romantic dramas.  Romantic dramas tend to be incredibly formulaic, schmaltzy and unrealistic.  Musicals are irritating because instead of spoken dialogue you have someone singing words at you, and it all seems so contrived and out of place (thus is if you're lucky.  Many musicals just use music as padding).\n\nSo it is with some trepidation that I watched La La Land.  The opening few scenes didn't help my fear that this was going to be a campy West Side Story-like implausible song-and-dance fest or a Les Miserables-like constant stream of nails-on-blackboard irritation.\n\nHowever, it soon became clear that La La Land is better than that.  The answer to \"How much better?\" increases the more into the movie you get.\n\nWhat sustains the movie initially is its warmth: the wonderful, often-funny dialogue and the interaction between the two main characters.  The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is fantastic and their performances (especially Emma Stone's) alone are worth the price of admission.\n\nEven the music is okay - sporadically used, not as intrusive as it could have been and it seems to integrate into the plot well.  Moreover, rather than just serve as padding, it helps move the plot along. (This all said, I would have preferred genuine dialogue!).  \n\nAt this point the movie was still heading down a rather safe, predictable \"boy meets girl...yadda yadda...happily ever after\" route.  The stuff of easy box office dollars rather than genuine art.\n\nThen writer-director Damien Chazelle (of Whiplash fame) ups the ante, moving it from a mere romantic drama to a drama that covers a host of themes - artistic integrity, the price of fame, chasing dreams, the trade-offs between relationships and careers, missed opportunities and life's big \"what if?\" moments.  An incredibly emotional, bitter-sweet ending ties it all together perfectly. \n\nWhat appeared to be a quaint-yet-innocuous film turned into a wonderfully profound, hard-hitting work of art.",

Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are perfectly matched as down-on-their luck lovebirds Sebastian and Mia who sing and dance their way to their dreams as they slowly find out their dreams may take them in opposite directions. Your eyes, ears, brain and heart are exposed to a domino-ing burst of skin-tingling charm, retina searing color, incredibly choreographed musical numbers, thrilling directing, and a surprising amount of depth. Much like Sebastian's attitude towards jazz, rather than modernizing the musical formula to appease contemporary expectations and attention-spans, Damien Chazelle pours his passion for the revolutionary charm of the classic musicals, bringing it remarkably to the present. The result is a film with all the charisma and character of a classic musical, endowed with 21st century technology and relatability. It's a jaw-droppingly, head-swimmingly, heart-thumpingly beguiling recipe that will soften even the hardest of hearts.",

While most highly popular movies take the standard approach to a smash hit, with a predetermined pattern for box office success, La La Land has an almost Indie film vibe to it. It has the essence of a musical, yet it doesn't trap itself within these confinements. The movie pulls on our heartstrings, playing into real life issues, but maintaining its whimsical feel. For not being singers or dancers, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling manage to pull the moves and songs off with ease. The chemistry between these two add to the enjoyment of the movie, as they pull us into their wonderful and vibrant world. While the movie does end in heartbreak, it works for the movie. It contrasts with the general vibrancy of the movie and plays into real experiences of real people. Life does not always end the way we want it to or the way it should. Our choices affect us, and we have to live with those choices. At the end of the day, La La Land was an artful and fun interpretation of struggles that the average person faces. In my opinion, the movie was a success.",

            "content": "\"La La Land\" Is The Supreme Full-Length Feature Film of 2016 & The Most Sublime Musical Movie of The Last Two Centuries\n\n\"Whiplash-\"winner of three Academy Awards, one Golden Globe, three BAFTAs, among others-was the shrewd introit of a filmmaker who categorically intended to shake superfluous and commercial Hollywood, a gallant American with a transcendent and irreplaceable film intellect which has to be perpetuated, praised and enjoyed in its entirety in these recession times, he is Damien Chazelle. It was the preliminary feature film of three of the most solemn festivals in cinema, now Chazelle manufactures a modern masterpiece that is going to live on perpetually since not exclusively sketches the reviving of a relegated genre out, but runs blindingly and naturally a romantic study aesthetically stunning, tunefully stunning, narratively stunning, and functionally sublime.\n\n\"La La Land\" is titled the third film led by the director; this has stars Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling and J. K. Simmons-although with an unusual minor character-among its ranks. Several people have pigeonholed it as melodramatic thing with musical taps, nevertheless, the celluloid transcends its own confines, splitting events course within four branches (the four seasons), which accentuates nature of every chapter in the story; however, although we are witnesses visibly of a narrative segmentation, spectators will not take long to apprehend that it is distributed in three fields directed by different genres and themes, what ultimately leads us to say that they are three independent stories correlated each other.\n\nThe story relates idealistic couple's adventures who lives in the district where professional disillusions of the planet settle: Hollywood, an arbitrary fable which will split up our divergent players. She yearns to predominate intransigently in the city of dreams; nonetheless, her aspirations are crumbling and dying by the unsuccessful castings and his job as an assistant in a coffee shop into Warner Bros. (an unbearable face to her suffering). On the other hand, he's a pianist who makes shows at weddings and private bars in order to open his own pub, getting his biggest design: protecting and rekindling the jazz exhausted flame. Later, their lives are adventitiously connected after a nocturnal walk in finding their automobiles, which originates a passionate love, overtakes a series of individual troubles. Although each of them obtained whom they loved, the nature of the unexpected will be at risk and the intrinsic of their relationship will keep them to the edge of the cornice, what in Hollywood would signify a death foretold.\n\nIt's irrefutable that Chazelle does not perform a neophyte exercise about actions which unfold with sections accompanied by singing and dancing since in his directional debut \"Guy and Madeleine on a Park Bench\" in addition to run notably his first steps within the matter, also emerged victorious in emulsifying melodrama with dazzling spontaneities. The initial section focuses on setting us in context within the dominant air through choreographic assemblies exuding pure vintage, these performances are honest reminiscences from monumental MGM productions: \"Top Hat,\" \"Singin' in the Rain,\" \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,\" \"An American in Paris,\" and more were potential sources for revitalization of classic musicals. The first take, we detail a broad blue sky by CinemaScope, going down gently amongst the congested and multitudinous vehicular traffic. Each individual listens to dissimilar music styles-an analogy will disperse into progressive musicality-thereon \"Another Day of Sun\" is the attention epicenter and an ineffable and arduous choreographic display takes place along the vehicle bridge, acts recorded in false long takes as if it were I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. A frantic and exciting prelude, which adjusts the environment where our main leads are going to get along. In the second part grandiose dances ala Broadway drastically lessen and are replaced by sentimental treatment; and what we cannot forget in a film by the director are the symphonic scores which are maintained potent, nevertheless, it provides gradually more preponderance on screen to jazz. This is where the narrative arcs obtained greater strength and Stone's and Gosling's roles shine with profound and authentic performances. After it moves through the crazy musical of the first part and the plausible dramatic affair of the second section, Chazelle concludes with a final flourish with a sudden, indefatigable, agile and the cunning mechanism in the concomitant of the events which transmute narrative in films; It makes you feel as if the tragicomedy would come to an end, but indeed one twist more is coming. Finally, choreographic ensembles break out again, but this time, we have not seen them with the same dynamism and explosiveness, dances are carefully chosen to express story grief. He provided an inspirational greeting with \"Whiplash\", with \"La La Land\" consolidates himself as one of the major American filmmakers, permitting Stone's and Gosling's performances and entire components of the celluloid to receive a guaranteed nomination at the Oscars for this love letter to Hollywood cinema.",

There are several occurrences of HOPE and JOY in said MUSICAL.  Such occurrences may be an anathema to your personal world view.  This review is an attempt to defend the aforementioned motion picture MUSICAL specifically, and the above referenced occurrences, generally.  You have been warned.\n\nHell yes, I am bitter.  How could I not be, with practically everything I love being cheapened or destroyed by going digital, with America (or is it 1933 Germany) days from being governed by the most amoral kleptocracy imaginable, and with the human race basically shrugging off finding practical science-based remedies to save our only planet?  I know I am not alone.\n\nAnd so it seems appropriate, even fashionable, to be cynical.  Survey the sum output of the Hollywood juggernaut and ask yourself how many films, TV shows, and recordings are steeped in a nihilistic world view, and conversely how many are at their core hopeful.  Between dour entertainment and the-sky-is-falling social media, it makes one want to never wake up.  Yet when something different comes along - a piece of work that tries to embrace joie de vivre, people can't wait to trash it.  A few of my friends claim to have walked out of La La Land, and several more hated watching it.  It begs a question: what would they prefer instead?\n\nWriter-director Damien Chazelle has emerged with a singular gift for creating characters driven to the edge of disaster by their fervor to do good work.  In Whiplash, both Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons found profound inspiration in their characters' drive.  In La La Land, the auteur has written Emma Stone's aspiring actress Mia and Ryan Gosling's jazz pianist Sebastian with similar uncompromising passions, and in a story arc as old as the movies, they must each lose his way and almost give up on her dreams before finding, at their lowest ebb, the missing piece that leads them to artistic fulfillment. Cliche, yes, but isn't that still the dream of the adventure we call Hollywood?  Isn't that why thousands still venture to the coast from every corner, willing to subsist on PA and extra work while taking acting classes, mounting original plays, making short films, performing songs at open mics, or burning the midnight oil working on screenplays?\n\nIn a world scarred by relentless cynicism, how can one not admire the ambition and unabashed optimism to make an old-fashioned musical?  Even if it's far from perfect?  Even if some songs are just passable?  Even if the lead actors aren't the best singers or dancers?  Even if Mandy Moore's choreography is only sometimes inspired?  Even if, and this is a big one for me, Gosling's fingers aren't anywhere close to matching the sound coming out of the piano?  Ryan said he took three months of piano lessons to prepare for the role, but the directorial choice to use his hands in closeup when he clearly can't play is a head scratcher.  But still.  This movie got made!\n\nThe true star of this show is DP Linus Sandgren and his team's exceptional, fluid cinematography.  While not the most technically perfect images of the year, the sheer effort of precision required to choreograph and capture a five minute thirty second dance routine with hundreds of dancers, and dozens of camera marks to hit, in focus, in rapid succession, perfectly in sync with the music, and all without hitting anyone in the head... in a SINGLE TAKE... is mind boggling.  Several of the dance routines are single take affairs... at magic hour.  No pressure there!  Sandgren's bold color choices and complex lighting cues make the film a joy to watch.\n\nIf we can, for two hours, believe that people can fight battles with light sabers, or that Spiderman can scale buildings, why is it so hard to believe that friends can break into song to express how they feel?  It's all movie magic, all make believe, and it all requires that good old-fashioned suspension of disbelief.\n\nMia, at the end of her rope, poignantly sings her way through an acting audition in a moment of magical realism that is the crux of this picture.  It's a perfect distillation of the requisite sacrifice required to live as an artist.  It is her Somewhere Over the Rainbow moment: the universal longing for a life less ordinary.  For me, it was heartbreakingly real.\n\nHollywood friends, if your sense of hope is not hale, if your lust for the dream not vibrant, if you are unwilling to let your heart be broken with every audition, every pitch, in the hope that out there somewhere lies a big confirming payoff for your endless sacrifice, then why, seriously, are you still at it? \n\nThis movie rekindled my fire.  Here's to the ones who dream.",

This is an insult to the great musical Hollywood classics like Singing in the Rain and Swing Time which this film pay homage to. The cinematography of Los Angeles was very good.

            "content": "Wonderfully nostalgic and gloriously choreographed, La La Land presents itself as a love letter to a Hollywood golden age, a time past when musicals were written for the screen and production numbers were full of Tinseltown glamor. For a sense of reference, there is an interview that admits the movie's appreciation of That Thing You Do, and we can even see some odes to that film sprinkled in along the way (watch for an appearance by an actor in that film, and similar blue backdrop). \n\nI might think that anyone would be hard pressed to resist this film's charm and toe-tapping energy (evening considering those I know who hate musicals with a passion), but the true wonder of the film actually lies in its ability to masquerade as a rather complex and affecting human drama, a drama that uses the music to enhance it rather than simply accentuating the musical itself.\n\nIt might be easy to miss the fact that La La Land is Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's third film together (Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad), but it would certainly be near impossible to deny their ever-growing chemistry. The young actors light up the screen with their unpolished voices and humble dispositions, managing to strike an imperfect balance between the charisma of song and dance and the ongoing development of their characters. The fact that they don't have the perfect voices adds a sense of raw honesty to the picture that makes it all the more enjoyable and allows the magic of the set to feel all the more real.imgres\n\nLa La Land is definitely not your average rom-com, and director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) uses a raw and uncalculated approach to colour the movie with an irresistible charm. For example, there is a rather large portion of the film (in the middle) that is absent of any music at all, and within the musical portions he uses the power of music to layer the unconventional love story with a rather bold mix of melancholy and romance that filters between realism and the fantastical. It allows the story to move fluidly between both realms, and provides the musical numbers to feel like they have a place and purpose in the story (rather than just spontaneously breaking out into song).\n\nThe film opens with a busy (but memorable) musical number set on an L.A. freeway, and then abruptly slows down the pace as we narrow in on the intersecting stories of Mia (Stone) and Sebastian (Gosling) from their unique perspectives as a part of the Hollywood culture. The film grounds itself in the L.A. landscape from the get-go, and becomes a rather endearing portrait of its storied past, something that gives us context for the main characters. \n\nAs their stories merge, we find their relationship filled with interesting dynamics and twists and turns, and their less than conventional love story has much to teach us about the nature of relationships and what it means to give ourselves to these relationships whole-heartedly.\n\nThese two Hollywood hopefuls share a similar struggle, caught somewhere between their dream and their reality, and eventually find inspiration through the sharing of each-other's stories (with the help of the dazzling romance of the L.A. lights), a moment (or moments) that aspires them to turn their dream into reality. But it quickly becomes clear that with this relationship also comes a new unexpected struggle- the fact that their burgeoning relationship is also beginning to re-orient their dreams towards the needs of each other, something that requires them to consider a certain level of give and take along the journey. imgres-1\n\nAt its heart, the film is about the choices that we make and how choices always come with consequence, both for good and for struggle. Much the same as we find in the film Brooklyn, the nature of \"choice\" is described in La La Land as a process in which we must always be brave enough to celebrate one path while grieving another.\n\nFor example, in the case of Sebastian, he makes the choice to take a full time music gig, a choice that sacrifices both his passion for the music he actually wants to play and the relationship he desires to give himself whole-heartedly to (and that is also continuing to invest in him).\n\nWhile the film is about choice, it is also about the importance of passion. Sebastian's neglect to fuel his passion for old-school jazz directly affects the passion he has for the relationship with Mia. In a wonderfully emotional scene, Mia encourages him not give up on his passion for jazz, which in a very real sense also becomes a plea not to neglect his passion for her as well. As she so poignantly states, by learning to love him she has also learned to love jazz, but it is also by learning to appreciate his passion for jazz that she has been able to grow a passion for him as well.  \n\nWhat breathes a sense of irony into Sebastion's story is that he remains so desperate to be seen as someone who is successful, so desperate that he is willing to lose a piece of who he is. But in the process, he ends up neglecting the one person who has accepted him for exactly who he is.\nimgres-3\n\nIn this same sense, Mia makes the choice, under the encouragement of Gosling, to pursue her own dream of becoming an actor, but eventually comes up against her own struggle with self-depreciating thoughts. It is her inability to see see herself as worthwhile and confident enough to act according to her strengths that causes her to lose her sense of passion, and it is this absence of passion that ends up keeping her from being able to fight for the relationship that she values so deeply.\n\nAnd here we arrive at the rather bittersweet nature of the narrative. Instead of finding their identity in one another, and instead of finding their purpose in encouraging each other towards becoming the best versions of themselves that they can be, they end up searching for their worth outside of themselves. The tragedy of the story is that this causes them to miss opportunities to truly see themselves through each other's eyes as well (some foreshadowing we are given in the early going as Sebastian abruptly brushes past Mia instead of stopping to hear her words of encouragement). And so we gain a picture, a rather magical picture in-fact, of the characters slowly drifting apart as the story moves forward. So slowly in-fact that the surprising and unsettling finish, which we should see coming, ends up hard to predict. And yet, it is this slownesss is what allows the viewer to truly appreciate the conflicting emotions that the ending does create:\n\nIt is time which slows down when they are together. It is also the slowness of time which pushes them apart. It is a rather beautifully rendered final scene that reminds the two characters that life could have been different if they had made different choices. Life could have been different had they learned to share in their passions rather than isolate themselves at the each others expense. Life could have different if they had made use out of the slowness and learned to cherish the momentary magic of simply giving time to looking into each others eyes.  But the painful truth of time is that they can't go back and change the past, they can only choose to live differently moving forward. This is what it means for the characters, as they say, to grow up. \n\nAs both characters eventually reemerge from this slow-drifing, they find themselves right back where they started, only this time carrying the consequence of their choices and the baggage of this missed time. And this is ultimately where Mia and Sebastian can teach us something about moving forward together or apart. Relationships push and pull us between the competing forces of understanding who we are as an individual and understanding who we are becoming together. It is when we let go on one side or the other that we stand in danger of losing sight of what the relationship can be. In La La Land's most melancholy moments we are reminded that we cannot live together in isolation. In it's most romantic ideals, we are reminded that we need not feel isolated when we make the effort to learn how to live together.\n\n\"Look at the view, \" Mia says as they stand overlooking the lights of L.A..\n\n\"I've seen better,\" Sebastian responds. imgres-2\n\nThis small exchange manages to capture the heart of La La Lands mix of melancholy and romance better than any other scene in the film. The truth is relationships are messy. Life is messy. It very rarely looks the way we imagine it should when we are blinded by love. But it is when we embrace the messiness and acknowledge the struggle of the shared space these relationships create, that we also give ourselves the freedom to open our eyes and experience what lies beyond the romance of the lights as well. And there is great worth in opening our eyes to see and enter into the bigger picture of what a wholly formed love really is, and often the bigger picture ends up much more beautiful and worthwhile than we could have ever imagined from the momentary sidelines. Mia and Sebastian caught a glimpse of what this could have been for them, and it was enough to change their perspective on what was possible moving forward, offering a bit of joy amidst the grief, a bit of music in the mundane, a bit of hope in the broken, a bit of dancing in the rain.\n\nAnd having just had the privilege of celebrating 12 years with the one who won me over all those years ago, La La Land was a good reminder to me that love is an investment that is worth more than anything this world has to offer.",

Two lives with different goals and dreams, both individuals ideal and perfect for each other but conflicted by... well, goals and dreams. But does it matter? No.\n\nSuch a fantastic movie, a crazy unique style of editing and cinematography and needless to say story, it really gave a sort of Memento feel about the film which was truly mesmerizing. Building an Antagonist for this film is so hard, but it was done so well with the use of John Legend, the musical scenes didn't seem to be useless exposition more so stylistic advancements to the plot using lyrics as a way to develop characters and to divert attention from romance and rather towards the passion of the individuals proving more important.\n\nDamien Chazelle is young and just what the film industry needs; someone to flip cliche narratives around and prove that meaningful film can result from it.\n\n4.5/5 Just because the outcome of the protagonist's relationship was predictable, since I've seen Whiplash.\n\nDamien Chazelle in 2017?\nYes please.",

            "content": "\"They don't make movies like they used to\". This is a phrase that is often passed around when discussing the films of today. We are living in a world of sequels and reboots of old films that never quite scratch the itch of the genuine feel classic films give us. However, every now and then a film comes along that reminds us of what we are currently missing in Hollywood and we fall in love with it instantly. La La Land is the sheer definition of that rare film and it stands second to none with it's direction, storytelling, and performances that make this film the pedigree of what Hollywood is capable of.\n\nDirector and writer Damian Chazelle made waves in 2014 with his small indy hit Whiplash and he does it again with La La Land. Chazelle has created a modern film that feels like a classic musical but makes it so gleeful and heartwarming that you fall in love with it instantly. From the way the camera moves during the song and dance numbers to the small nuanced moments of raw emotion and even the color pallet, La La Land carries enough weight that you feel for our main characters throughout the entire film. Chazelle even has small elements of classic films to really show how this film isn't just a musical but a love letter to how musicals of the 30?s and 40?s. These inclusions give the film more weight and timeliness with the heart of the message and just proves that Chazelle is a director who will surely grow into one of Hollywood's finest.\n\nThe story here is very simple but extravagant in it's execution. The story follows an aspiring actress and a jazz pianist who become entangled with one another in the brutal world of Hollywood. This is indeed a modern musical with all of the passion and wonder of classic films. The story progresses in ways that you really don't see anymore with dance numbers that show us their struggles rather than bore us with pointless dialogue. The songs used in the film are catchy but they feel genuine and crucial to the story, giving every scene more weight. It is incredibly hard for a film to find the balance between story and song but La La Land grabs hold to it and uses these incredible lyrics and dances to convey emotion and elevates this story, and the film as a whole, into a true work of art.\n\nA film like this is nothing without its cast and La La Land has two of the best around to bring this film to life. Ryan Gosling plays the jazz pianist Sebastian and delivers another award worthy performance. His timing is impeccable and when he does something as little as staring you can feel everything his character is going through. Playing the actress Mia is Emma Stone and she is nothing short of a triumph. Her performance is so powerful and moving that you empathize with her from the minute you see her. Gosling and Stone are no strangers to each other and their chemistry shines once again. When they are together you feel like this is a powerhouse couple and you care about what happens to them because you believe they would be together. It is very rare for a film to feature performances like this and to have chemistry on top of that is nothing short of perfection.\n\nThis is normally the part of the review where I break down where the film went wrong, however I can't do that for this. Everything in this movie is so masterfully done that I can't say that this film struggled in a single area. Sure, if I were nitpicking I would say that the pacing struggled in one scene; but to do that is just petty when the rest of the film works as well as it does.\n\nOverall La La Land is an anomaly in today's cinema. It embraces the past to progress into the future and does it in such a way that you can't help but feel like you have witnessed something special. When discussing musicals films like West Side Story, The Sound of Music, and Singing in the Rain all come to mind. Now, mark my words in 10 or 20 years we will talk about La La Land in the same regard. This is an instant classic if there ever was one and we will still be singing and enjoying this film for years to come. Do yourself a favor and don't miss out on this. Films such as this don't happen but once every decade or so, be sure you witness this and see this as soon as possible.",

The dancing was rudimentary and didn't take a great deal of skill like the musicals of the mid 20th century. I appreciate the fact that people have positive opinions about this film but for the life of me, I cannot figure out why. When viewing a musical, you'd expect to have several songs fluttering around in your head but after this, not a single one stuck in my mind. And that was after two viewings. I was genuinely excited to see this film. It looked like it had everything. Two amazing leads, music that would inspire a new generation to love musicals, and a lot of jazz. Sadly, I was let down.

I didn't find any of them catchy to listen to, only passable, especially the opening song and one shortly after. Luckily the film thrives when they aren't focused on the singing and dancing. La La Land has so much style and feels like an old school throwback to what film used to be. See it.",

It's an invigorating addition to the musical film genre that brings to mind the greats like 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'My Fair Lady'. But don't let the tag \"musical\" put you off. This film stands on it's own even without the fantastic musical talents of Justin Hurwitz at the helm. Speaking of the music, director Damien Chazelle handles this film with as much care and attention as he did with his last film 'Whiplash'. Once again Damien Chazelle fines the right balance of story progression and character development along with finding the right times to interject with a musical number. This film is full of colour and the aesthetic of Hollywood has never looked better. Los Angeles is on full display in this film showing us some dazzling vistas. I honestly can't say enough about how pretty this film is. Everything just pops with vibrant visuals. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling stand toe to toe and really play off each other with pleasant results. Both are a joy to listen too but Emma Stone really steals the show with her solo performance. My only complaint is the run time. Theres scenes in this film that puzzle me as to why they stayed in. 15-20 minutes could have easily been taken off without hurting the overall film. This film was a great way to end this years amazing line up movies to come out. See this one in the cinemas!!",

If you want to really go GA GA look up one of the really excellent films.  Please see La La Land however so you can compare it to past musicals and see why La La Land doesn't hold a candle to a picture like \"Singing in the Rain\", \"Funny Girl\". or \"My Fair Lady\".not to mention \"West Side Story\". La La Land viewed in isolation may \"appear\" like a good musical film but if you are a fan of the genre  you will quickly see why some people are rejecting the glowing band wagon reviews being heaped on La La Land.

The story plays out a little like the great NEW YORK, NEW YORK, but the charming chemistry of the two stars is far better than DeNiro and Liza Minelli. The great direction and writing of Damien Chazelle (WHIPLASH) recalls the loving view of LA that Woody Allen can bring to Manhattan, with the staging of a Vincent Minelli. There's a plot device to separate the lovers that's a little clumsy--although expected, but everything else works from the smashing traffic opener to a lovely coda of what could have been.

Every film enthusiast finds this movie to be spectacular in every way. People love every single aspect that there is in La La Land. Damien Chazelle has proven himself to be a filmmaker keep an eye on; ever since his 2014 feature Whiplash that has been praised by both critics and audiences alike, and won J.K Simmons a Best Supporting Actor award at the 2015 Academy Awards. After the success of Whiplash, in 2016 Chazelle released a film called La La Land. This movie has the potential to be one of the best films of all time. It pays homage to retro musicals, and it does give off it own flavor too. However almost every bit of potential is wasted. I will give credit to Gosling and Stone who are good, but that's about it. Damien Chazelle's writing and directing is all over the place. The cinematography is probably the best aspect of this entire feature, but there are some scenes that do not mix well with the films cinematography at all. The score and the songs are trying so hard to be more than what it is. The second act feels as if you are watching a totally different movie due the direction this movie takes. The runtime also could've been cut down a little too because there are a few scenes that drag. This movie has been praised by so many around the world, and in SOME ways that make sense, but at the same time it doesn't.",

And I understand that this is not necessarily the point of musicals. They are spectacles,  kinetic journeys of movement choreographed behind and in front of the camera. With that in mind, I can tell you it was pretty, and fun and cool, and the performances were serviceable, but i cannot tell you I was moved in any significant way.",

Mia and Ryan Gosling's Sebastian flirt, sing and dance a charming number overlooking the L.A. skyline, and start to fall in love. But once Mia ditches her boring beau of one month for Sebastian, things get Casablanca earnest, fast. This is where the film starts to come apart. Chazelle embarks on a very (128 minutes runtime!) extended meditation on the sacrifices required to pursue one's dreams, with detours into jazz and fieldtrips through the city of Los Angeles that will delight lovers of the City of Angels (including, not coincidentally, members of The Academy) but leave everyone else feeling like outsiders on an inside joke. Since neither Gosling nor Stone are dancers or singers (though give them both an A for effort), the musical numbers tend to drag rather than entertain. What we are left with is a highly original, but also highly uneven film that manages to come up short of the Hollywood classics at which its lofty ambitions are aimed. In eschewing tried-and-true Hollywood formulas, La La Land manages to fall into a sort of filmic no-man's land. For Chazelle, like his Sebastian and Mia, there's a tragic cost to pursuing one's dreams.",

I'm intimidated by the daunting task that is reviewing it, because writing about this incredible film is like holding a delicate crystal bird in my hand. I could drop it at any moment, dooming its future to shattering on the floor. In this case, though, I would probably be unable to even catch the bird, and if I did manage to, I wouldn't be able to hold it for long before it wrenched out of my hands and soared away to Los Angeles.\n\nCritics, Hollywood professionals, and everyday moviegoers alike have spent the last few weeks walking out of the theatre with stars in their eyes and music in their ears. I am one of those people. As a prospective filmmaker, I was excited to see this film for many reasons, but there was a review at the end of one of the trailers which said something like, \"they don't make movies like this anymore,\" that really caught my eye. Well, whoever said that was right. I literally cannot come up with words good enough to describe this film, because La La Land has created a new alphabet. The struggling actress/musician is a classic phenomenon, but Chazelle has veered off the beaten path. Rather than giving his characters everything they want, an unrealistic yet undeniably enjoyable classic Hollywood ending, his characters learn their lessons, so that they truly grow throughout the movie. However, rather than crush his character's dreams by proving how unrealistic they are, he has let them soar, teaching a valuable lesson to even the most cynical audience members. When it was first discovered that Ryan Gosling would be singing, there was an uproar of teenage excitement. However, I can assure you that this film is to be taken very very seriously, it isn't some bubble gum chick flick. Chazelle has wiped the board on musicals, and filled it in with his own definition. Even if you don't like musicals, I dare you not to be tapping your foot and singing these songs for the next week after seeing this. Really. I loved it so much, I saw it again the very next week, and I would see it  a million more times if I could.  Watching La La Land is like drinking six espressos on a technicolor beach, and both times I have seen it have been followed by sleepless nights singing songs off the best original soundtrack in history (thank you thank you thank you Justin Hurwitz, you genius) wondering how I can get my hands on Mia's dresses, wishing I could dance, crying over the amazing ending (but no spoilers here), and picturing both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling as they collectively drop the mic on an already silent and stunned audience with their aw-worthy performances. This film is the perfect love letter to Los Angeles. This film slaps cynics across the face, and turns them into dreamers. Being a prospective filmmaker, I try to watch as many films as I possibly can, and soak in the ideas. This film cannot compare, though. It simply can't. I cannot compare my own ideas to this, but I walked out of that theater saying, \"that is why I want to make movies.\" This film pours pure genius across the globe and breaths new life into cinema. It may just have slid into the category of best love story of all time. Chazelle (I just love saying his name, don't you?) is surfing a wave of uncharted territory, and I can't wait to see what else comes from his genius. Only thirty one years old (he wrote the screenplay for La La Land when he was only twenty six), Damien Chazelle has already directed two of my favorite movies (this and Whiplash, another stunner of it's own right). Composer Justin Hurwitz has been his companion on both movies, and he is also an absolute genius. Maybe the best part of Chazelle's works is the fact that he has created these wonderful films without the bloated ego that dominates many celebrated Hollywood directors thus far, and it is oh so refreshing.I hesitate to say the words, \"perfect movie,\" for anything, because you never know what could come along and clear the board all over again, but this is absolutely as close to it as I have ever seen. This is the. best. film I have ever seen. La La Land takes the cake as far as I'm concerned, I don't need an oscar to prove it.\n\nSo, here's to the ones who dream!",

Having Jazz be the thing which is quintessentially the surrogate for old Hollywood was fantastic. The musical numbers harked back to an older era whilst still being engaging to a 21st century audience. I thought both performances were fantastic from the main 2 leads and thought their unrequited love to be both heartbreaking and beautiful. The scene where we see what could have been is again both heartbreaking and wonderful. I wish i could unsee the film so i could see it for the first time again.",

            "content": "This film was an absolute slaughter of artistic integrity. It felt as though aspects of the film were pulled from different realities, but I have so many digressions I find it hard to find a starting point, yet I will attempt. First and foremost, the plot in the first half is hardly passable, no character is remotely empathetic, and for a Hollywood film about Hollywood as a love letter to the earlier musicals of Hollywood there seem to a big set of \"of sorts\" lying around. Pastiche comes to mind, but in order to be an iconic parody of a film you first must establish what the previous films entailed. Older films we're based in reality, the musical numbers had expositional purpose... Right out of the gate, first scene, opening number, there are necessary camera pans, unenthusiastic lyrics, tedious choreography, and confusing foley mixing. No semblance of narrative structure is brought forth through the opening, no character motive, and barely even any recognizable mise-en-scene is apparent. Speaking of which (aside from the makeup which went unnoticed and therefore did its job well), the setting and costume design made me want to vomit as my stomach churned at the candy-inspired mono-colored wardrobe mixed with similarly bizarre lighting. The entire first half of the film plays out like this, all the while I thought \"Why is this not a theatrical production?\" Sadly I can't even say that it would make a decent play as the plot seems to have tripped and died on the way to the starting gate. The first fifty minutes our main leads Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) are insufferable guttersnipes with big dreams; mind you, the problem was not their ambition, but their disconnect from reality. And that indeed is the main problem with this film. All films, in some small sense, must have some sense of reality or have empathetic qualities, but this film seems to have been pulled from different dimensions. Everything previously described comes together in this onslaught of strangulation that has you gasping for structure and/or a narrative all the while continuing to press out mediocre songs. I cannot for the life of me think of why Damien Chazelle would turn such incredible potential into a hurricane of abstractions and nonsense. SPOILERS While at Griffith Observatory, after Mia interrupted a film by standing in front of the screen to find Sebastian (for some inadequately explained reason), both characters begin to dance in a Fred Astaire style number but before that happens a handkerchief flies into the air in an observation room and the characters look to camera and go into space. There is no reason for them to do this, none at all, but there it is, assumedly because the director instructed so. As much as it pains me to do this, I am entirely pinning the blame on the director. There was some incredible talent pre-, during, and post-production, yet none of their labor is apparent until the last half hour of the film. Gosling and Stone, whether together or separate, are fantastic talents; putting them in this film was miscasting at its most egregious. However, despite all the nagging, there are some positive elements to the film. The editing, despite Chazelle's possible tantrums of \"artistry\", was impressive and the last half hour of the film came together nicely in its own. The final songs were empathetic, more grounded, unfortunately not memorable, but were charismatic, and that, in my opinion, was what almost the entirely of this film lacked, charisma. Since this film had so much going on at once, there was no appeal, no allure, so much assailing on the mind left me detached and longing for a decent... everything. The \"life that could have been\" sequence at the very end was the only piece of film that I would slice away from the rest of the dross and hang on the refrigerator, a masterpiece in story-rich, enticing, compelling film-making that Chazelle so desperately attempted at from start to end. Still, this is only one man's opinion, and I whole-heartedly know that this film is the bee's knees for another, so I still recommend it just in case this is your kind of film. There is so much more to say, but I refuse to beat a dead horse thats already been rotting on the floor since minute one.",

            "content": "When you make a film as good as Whiplash, Hollywood normally lets you have lots of free reign over your next project. It just so happens that Damien Chazelle's next passion project is a love letter to 1940's Hollywood. I can't think of a single film that has captured the glory of 1940's Hollywood, since the glory days of 1940's Hollywood. From the extravagant production design with its luscious colours and wonderful locations to its great use of Jazz in its soundtrack, this film makes Los Angeles look like heaven. I was just there and I can safely say that the real Los Angeles is not as beautiful as it is shown in La La Land. As for the musical numbers, I need to discuss. First off, I generally like musicals. Grease, Hairspray, a countless number of Disney of films, I'm a little fan. However, if it is full of cheesiness, it can turn me off right away (Moulin Rouge has this effect on people). The film opens with a giant musical number without any of the main cast during a traffic jam on a LA Interstate. I have to admit, I was like, \"If this is the whole movie, I'm in for a long ride.\" Another mediocre musical number followed right afterward and I wasn't really feeling it. However, when the movie introduced Ryan Gosling and his storyline, I was onboard. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have unbelievable chemistry and so likable. I think I just might be in love with Emma Stone. Straight up. She's perfect. The next musical number was the one you see them perform on the poster of the film. That's when I was really along for the musical ride. From that point on, the music was all very good. Whether it made you wanna dance, or cry, the music was all top notch. You can really tell this film was directed by Damien Chazelle because he brings lots of his trademark editing styles and writing techniques to this film and they are all solid. So if you are a fan of classic Hollywood, musicals, jazz, have a crush on either Emma Stone or Ryan Gosling, this is a movie for you. I have a feeling that this film will sweep up lots of Oscars and I believe this will become an instant classic!",

The two meet in Los Angeles and fall in love.\n\nI went into the movie theater with unreasonably high expectations. As a musician (kind of) and lover of film, it was impossible to watch La La Land without a very critical eye. That being said, LA LA LAND IS AMAZING.\n\nAlthough the movie takes place in present day, it emulates classic cinema in every way. The absurd optimism, the bright colors, and some of the camerawork work together to take the viewer on a trip through a time machine. Justin Hurwitz, who was a classmate of Chazelle's and wrote the music for Whiplash, whipped up another knockout score full of big band jazz straight out of the 40's and 50's. The musical numbers, random as they were, are brilliantly shot. The opening sequence alone pulled me in with one continuous shot through the 3+ minute scene. From a technical standpoint, this is a nearly flawless movie.\n\nOf course, none of those things matter if the story isn't any good. However, La La Land boasts a well-written story led by two knockout performances. I'll admit that I've never been the biggest fan of either actor, but they both give what I'd say is probably their best performances to date. The chemistry between them has never been stronger (this is Gosling and Stone's third collaboration). This movie asks important questions for all aspiring artists. Is it more important to be loved or to do what you love? Is it worth it to live as a struggling artist and to keep trying?\n\nI have nothing negative to say about La La Land. This is an absolute must-see, especially for fans of old-time cinema, musicals, and cheesy feel-good stories. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a soundtrack to go purchase.\n\nFinal grade: A+\n\n-Ben",

Thorough the first half and hour of the film Mia and Sebastian characters bump into each other in a very comedic situations defining their roles and presenting them to the audience as mean to be together. \n\nChazelle pays perfect tribute to films like Singing in the Rain, American in Paris and West Side Story. On the other hand the plot in La La Land explore stories about dreams, aspirations and how we put them aside just for the purpose of make money, sacrificing the true essence of us. Mia represents the dreamers; the people are just willing to leave everything behind to fulfill your goals. Sebastian represents the traditional, the classic. He wants to preserve jazz knowing that is dying, like film which metaphorically speaking is portrayed in the movie theater \"Rialto\" when Mia and Sebastian goes to see Rebel Without a Cause and later is closed, may be out of business. \n\nLa La Land is divided in seasons, a reminder that some times are better than other, no matter how's the weather.

Okay, the movie uses classic musicals (Singin' in the Rain, An American in Paris, etc.) as its blueprint; those films are this movie's heart. However, while showing love, admiration, respect, and drawing substantial inspiration from those classics, this movie throws in some modern twists based more in reality as if to say, \"Yeah, those classics and what not -- they're great, but real life isn't a fantasy like that,\" and this film plays on this dichotomy through one of the most basic plot lines ever: a romance, but not a straightforward, simple, fairy-tale romance. This is a romance based in reality (REAL is the key word here, in case I haven't made that clear), but wait! This is a musical! Characters randomly start singing and dancing out of nowhere! That's not reality, right? Ah Ha! This is the film's genius -- it depicts reality through a window of fantasy. It balances the two and bounces back and forth between them which is new territory for a musical as far as I know. It draws from the fantasy, simple, straightforward joy of the classics while adding a modern twist that also keeps the film grounded in the real world. Also, the plot and emotions here are not simple and straightforward at all; it bounces all over the place (as things do in reality). There are happy moments, sad moments, laughing moments, crying moments, silly moments, heartwarming moments, eyebrow-raising moments, quirky idiosyncrasies, all kinds of old movie stuff to point out in backgrounds -- this movie does not stop. It is easily one of the best -- probably the flat-out best -- musicals of this millennium thus far. It is a charming, brilliant blending of the old and the new while firmly embracing both.

Every few years someone in Hollywood tries to resurrect the genre in hopes it cashes in on the nostalgia. This time it's La La Land's turn. \n\nFor reasons unexplained I enjoyed the film. Maybe it's because it wasn't wall to wall musical numbers? Maybe I was in a good mood? Maybe the director knew what he was doing? (The same guy who did Whiplash...which I still highly recommend) Maybe I've gone soft? It's a new year after all.\n\nThe movie wasn't perfect either. It's another \"Hollywood romanticizing Hollywood\" flick. Ryan Gosling is completely miscast....unless they were looking for the trifecta of a bad singer, dancer and actor. Also, the movie loses a bit of traction towards the middle act. \n\nBut here I am...recommending this film.",

Who aspires to walk into Starbucks a star and order lattes to go; you get your assistant to do it. The lack of imagination was astounding, it was an outrageous display of shallow romanticism. If La La Land was meant to be a nostalgic nod to the old Hollywood Musical it only evidenced the fact that the Hollywood musical is a dead art form and has been for a while, they should treat it like a crash victim with no health insurance do not revive. If you don't have the talent don't do it. Sadly the style of dancing the film was trying to emulate only works if you spend a gruelling 5 to 9 months working on inspired routines.; It was 128 mins of dancing with the stars. The film was as lame as that terrible song Ryan was tapping out on the piano every five minutes; what was that, it wasn't Jazz?  RedTube's 'Keys of Christmas' was far more entertaining, the sining was great, the dancing was sporty, the cast was sexy and funny. And the casting was multi-ethnic and culturally diverse.

            "content": "Dear god this was a great Christmas gift to myself.\nChazelle certainly shows us how movies are meant to be made. The story of these two individuals aspiring to make it big in LA is certainly a common theme yet the film does such a great job in keeping hold of such a theme as \"follow your dreams\" that the love story, while playing a hefty part of the film, actually serves to project the theme tenfold with a heartbreaking and beautifully shot epilogue.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that i absolutely adore Emma Stone, as she has proven to be a terrific actress with such an array of character. Ryan Gosling has also proven time and again that he is much more than a pretty face and even in the midst of a love story he can display a hilarious and heartfelt performance.\n\nHaving said this, where the film lacks is quite odd, as the film is pegged as a \"musical\", audiences will be surprised to find out that the musical elements in this film are fairly slim. With beautiful upbeat numbers within the first 30 min of the film, it soon transitions into that of a love story between these two great actors, with some numbers sprinkled about, until the ending 30 min where Stone's emotional solo as well as a tear jerking epilogue rekindle the musical aspect. Secondly, knowing Stone has a musical background and expecting Gosling to pull out a voice relative to his other many talents, both seemed to have unusual and sometimes offputting voices. Stones being very high pitched and sighy, while Gosling having difficulty hitting clear low notes as well as high.\nDespite all this, the film's story and development is so fluid and well written that I could easily look past these faults. It would be very difficult not to enjoy this film, as the characters are quite likable and their chemistry is amazing considering the past films Stone and Gosling have been together. And th CAMERA WORK!!! my god the camera work was so great. It is truly how a film should be shot, not only did the technicolor-esque feel and style make it a visually stunning experience. But when you realize how little the camera cuts and how it seems to be following characters as they move, whether behind a wall or around a corner, its this commitment to rolling that gives way for more authentic and unique performances. Even the musical numbers seem nearly all one take and its such a masterful use of the camera that i cannot sit here without stating how such a subtle commitment is just one of many reasons to love this film!",

Mia is a struggling actress trying to get picked up, while Sebastian is a traditional jazz pianist trying to start up his own club. After a few encounters, the duo hit it off and try to help each other achieve what they want most.\n\n            When I first saw the trailers for this film, I thought it looked good, but I didn't think I was going to impress me that much. But as further trailers popped up, that's when I got the indication that this was a Hollywood musical. Not a film based on a Broadway musical, nor was it a jukebox musical, or an animated film with songs in it. A fresh new Hollywood movie with songs written specifically for the silver screen. I got a friend of mine to join me for New Year's Eve, and I sat down thinking, \"Come on, Damien Chazelle. Show me what you're really capable of.\"\n\nLiterally from the first opening number, I was hooked. The songs, composed and orchestrated by Justin Hurwitz and written by Pasek and Paul, were absolutely hypnotic. They had me wrapped in this familiar spell that I was caught it when I first saw films like \"An American in Paris,\" \"Holiday Inn,\" and \"Singing in the Rain.\" Matched up with the choreography, the editing, and the cinematography, and you have easily a film that will go down in history with films. With how nostalgic it felt listening to tunes like \"Someone in the Crowd\" and \"A Lovely Night,\" it made me happy to a point where I felt myself close to crying. That shows you how damn good a film can be.\n\nI also love watching the story between Mia and Sebastian unfold. Of course, they don't like each other at first, especially when their first few encounters leave Sebastian in a relatively bad mood. But as they get to know each other better, you see these two get used to the things that one loves yet the other hates, and help each other find that spark that they need to really bring themselves to that goal, whether for the better or worse. Originally, the duo was planned to be Miles Teller and Emma Watson, but I feel like Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were a better fit. With this being the third film that they've collaborated on as a couple, the other two being \"Crazy Stupid Love\" and \"Gangster Squad,\" they really have left a place in cinema history as the modern day Hollywood couple, in the same vein as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.\n\nA true major selling point that I loved about the movie was how it takes risky moves with the clich\u00e9d love story musical, especially with its ending. Despite it being a bit down, I came out completely satisfied with it. It gave me this feeling a reassurance that I hadn't felt all year, and I was extremely happy. I think that's something a film should be applauded for, is leaving you with that true moment of satisfaction that sticks even after leaving.\n\nIf you have yet to see \"La La Land,\" what are you doing reading this for then? Go out and see this damn movie right now! It's getting major buzz at the Oscars for Best Picture, and they're right to declare that. From its acting, to its story, its choreography, and fantastic music, it's a film that deserves to be applauded for its love letter to the Old Hollywood musicals of yesterday.",

Commercials will have you believe you're going to watch West Side Story. You're not. The beginning and end are a musical, but the middle is...musical. Big difference.\n\nThe story is thoroughly charming, and the leads are as well, and together they have an obvious, explosive chemistry. \n\nThe script portrays a real world, but it also veers close to cornball at times, and also both avoids and embraces several movie cliches.\n\nOverall, it's enjoyable, but I have three quibbles: 1) What is a genius like J.K. Simmons doing in a throwaway role? 2) I'm supposed to believe an actress with luminous, expressive eyes - and overall mien - like that is actually struggling to find work where she's expected to be luminous and expressive? 3) The media is losing it's mind over this, in an ingenuine way in which they lose their mind over any film that has Hollywood revering itself (The Artist, Hail Caesar!, et al).\n\nStill: heartbreaking, bittersweet, and fun, though it leaves you scratching your head a little bit, especially with that Jacob's Ladder-esque ending (spoiler?)",

Ok, I went into it knowing it was going to be a musical (75% music), and I took my mom (who really wanted to see it as she loves musicals).  However, it was terrible.  The songs were mediocre at best, but most were not good or catchy.  The cast can dance, but the dancing is nothing new or spectacular. It's cute in rare places, but boring.  There wasn't much of a story other than a chance romance between 2 Hollywood wannabee's.  However, halfway through it, my mom turned to me, whispered in my ear, \"This movie is awful, can we go?\"  And I realized she was right.  The best parts were the movie trailers before the movie.  So we walked out 1 hour and 20 minutes into the movie.  I'd give it 0.5/5 stars because of the cinematography. But this is only the 3rd film ever that I've walked out of in all my movie going life.  (the others are Mortal Kombat 2: Annihilation, and Old Dogs).  So I can't even rate it because it was so dull.  Go watch Star Wars again, you'll have a much better time. Keep On Movie Watching.",

            "content": "December 16, 2016\n\nThe key to a good musical is striking a balance between the ostentatious fantasy and the grounded substance (and hopefully there is grounded substance). Hollywood's \"institutional\" musicals, like \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"My Fair Lady,\" are beloved not because of their song and dance numbers (although these certainly play a role in their appeal) but because they're actually about something when you take these elements away. Their longevity and indelibility derive from the films' strong messages and subtext, while the musical sequences provide the bells and whistles-they make the movies more fun and entertaining. \n\nPerhaps finding such a harmony between depth and spectacle is hard to do and explains why musicals are so rare these days compared to when they dominated Hollywood's Golden Age and remained prolific up through the 1960s. But \"La La Land\" made me believe there could be a resurgence because its quality and craftsmanship deserves comparison to the titles I mentioned above, which is saying a lot. At its heart is a bittersweet love story that feels real and pure and it's this element that writer-director Damien Chazelle keeps coming back to in order to make \"La La Land\" work as a thoughtful drama, while the music, lyrics and dance sequences give it an extra kick.\n\nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling star as Mia and Sebastian, the film's predestined couple who at first deplore each other but soon realize they may be soul mates. Mia is an aspiring actress who works at a studio cafe and lives with three roommates, who are also would-be actresses. Sebastian is a jazz pianist who'd rather promote classic jazz artists by opening up his own club than rehash the same old jingles in a mediocre restaurant where the owner doesn't allow him to be inventive. When Sebastian decides to put a spin on things, his tune catches the ears of Mia, who happens to be walking by. She goes in to compliment him, but he completely blows her off after his boss (J.K. Simmons) fires him. \n\nThis isn't Mia and Sebastian's first encounter-they initially crossed paths during a brief stint of road rage on a busy Los Angeles freeway, which follows the film's opening song and dance number, \"Another Day of Sun,\" during which the motorists mitigate the stresses of gridlock by singing and swinging their bodies. Everyone takes part except Mia and Sebastian, who are too concentrated on the next moves of their careers. They meet for a third time at a mutual friend's party, and soon thereafter the wheels of romance and destiny are set in motion, as is Mia and Sebastian's willingness to breakout into their own song and dance sequences.\n\nThe movie is called \"La La Land\" for obvious reasons. Not only do Mia and Sebastian live in Los Angeles but they literally detach themselves from reality as they look into each other's eyes, fly through the air, and sing to one another and themselves, making the entire cityscape and the Hollywood Hills, particularly Griffith Park and its observatory, their own personal, moonlit stage. \n\nThe film is wonderfully romantic, fun and captivating as it follows Mia and Sebastian's blossoming and eventually tumultuous relationship through the four seasons of a year, but perhaps what's most enduring and surprising about it is how genuine their respective experiences in the film and music industries come across. This must stem from the fact that Chazelle himself is a young artist and it's clear his screenplay draws from his own personal experiences when it comes to the pain, frustration and financial hardships Mia and Sebastian must weather in order to achieve their hopes and dreams in show business. Their hurdles never seem exaggerated, right down to Mia's auditions and her attempting to put on a one-woman show, as well as Sebastian trying to convince himself that touring with a jazz band led by his former cohort (John Legend) is something he actually wants. We sense each character's anguish, both as career people and as one half of a couple struggling to find common ground. That brings up another surprise about \"La La Land\": the outcome of Mia's, Sebastian's, and then Mia & Sebastian's, stories are never certain. How things wrap up-happy, sad or open-ended-I leave for you to discover.\n\nAnd discover you should, because \"La La Land\" is alive and magical, deep and true. It's exceptionally produced and enormously entertaining, with not one scene where the energy isn't busting. If I had to criticize it, I'd mention that Emma Stone is probably better suited for the fantasy and Gosling the drama but that neither actor is one hundred percent right for both. Stone seems confined to the make-believe cloud upon which Mia floats, while Gosling doesn't seem like he's ever able rise to it with the same enthusiasm and conviction. His singing and dancing, in particular, feel unnatural. I suppose one could argue this works in the film's favor and mirrors the characters respective natures, thus balancing things out, but when Stone tried to be dramatic or Gosling tried to perform, I was too aware of what they were doing and I ended up seeing the actors on-screen instead of their characters, which proved somewhat distracting. There's little doubt both leads will get an Oscar nomination, but to say they should win is a bit of a stretch.\n\nNevertheless, \"La La Land\" reminded me why musicals used to thrive. When they're done right, as this one is, they can be entertaining on so many levels: from their drama, comedy, and romance, to their music, songs and dancing. Of course, by taking on so much, they also run the risk of becoming overwrought and turning into an unfulfilling mess (\"Hello, Dolly!\"),  but \"La La Land\" practices moderation and finds balance. It focus first on its essential human story, which is about our inherent desire to feel special among our peers and to the person we love, and then on its music, dancing and technical presentation. The former makes it great; the latter make it greater.",

It started as a musical with dancing on the US-101 on-ramp just south of downtown Los Angeles, but it really wasn't, except in parts, which was a little odd, but I liked the characters and was not bored for a minute.\n\nNeither actor is a talented singer or dancer, but they acquitted themselves well enough in those areas and were excellent in their roles. There were fun, disappointing, and very bittersweet moments in the film, which I think the Academy will likely give the Oscar to, because Hollywood people love celebrating themselves and Hollywood/the movie industry/acting (see \"Birdman\" [a terrific film to be sure] as a case in point over the classic \"Boyhood\").\n\nThis film wasn't everything I hoped it would be, and it had some less than stellar sequences, but overall I liked it as much as anything I have seen this year because it was unique and stylish and very realistic in the end with regard to relationships and how things just go sometimes.",

            "content": "Musicals are a rare breed in cinemaland these days. Once every so often a big budget effort (Chicago, Les Mis, Into the Woods) comes along to remind us they do still exist, but even these films don't do much to entice newcomers to the genre. Now I don't know if La La Land will succeed where others have failed and prove to be the birth of a musical reconnaissance, but if any movie can achieve it, this is definitely the one. Vibrant, funny and superbly shot, this tongue-in-cheek throwback to the upbeat musicals of Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire is a toe-tapping delight from the ambitious highway-set opening number all the way to the closing what-could-have-been sequence. Following up after the phenomenal Whiplash, writer-director Damien Chazelle has definitively announced his arrival into Hollywood; the combination of flair and technical mastery in which he executes each diverse set piece is astounding. The song and dance numbers continually build on the story - a struggling actress and a budding Jazz pianist juggle life, love and their lofty dreams - whilst always bringing something fresh both visually and musically, whether it's an 80s parody dance sequence or a soulful jazz interlude. Director of photography Linus Sandgren must be given his due praise too; the camerawork is both enterprising and stylish, the frequent unbroken tracking shots adding another level of pizzazz to the proceedings. Yet for all of the wonder and awe brought by Chazelle and his crew, the film still requires a headlining duo capable of providing an emotional core that can match the song and dance fireworks. Step up Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. In their third movie opposite each other (after Crazy, Stupid, Love and Gangster Squad) the ridiculously talented acting pair not only boast a sizzling chemistry on screen, but also get to show off their dancing and singing skills that, much to the normal person's ire, are obviously brilliant. More accessible to the average moviegoer than many previous modern musicals, La La Land is a triumphant convergence of music, dance and awe-inspiring cinema.",

Lousy songs and the 2 main characters were not very good singers. Even their dancing was limited. I just can't understand what the majority of critics and general audience saw in this. But I give some credit to the jazz music. Not that bad. Why anyone would compare this movie to Whiplash is nuts. Just no comparison. Whiplash, which I loved, only did music where music was appropriate. Not like a classical musical where people sing and dance anywhere. Nostalgia for the good old days??? They can keep it. I saw with 3 others and none of them liked it. I went mainly to see why it was getting so much potential Oscar buzz and I try to see all the Oscar nominees.  It this sorry excuse for a movie wins the Oscar, I will be very sad.",

Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have chemistry as the lovers from the boy meets girl, boy loves girl, boy loses girl in the acting department but are sorely lacking in the singing and dancing department though Gosling acquits himself in piano playing.\n\nEverything you read, including comments by the director and screenwriter Damien Chazelle, has remarks about it being a salute to old Hollywood movies and to Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Judy Garland but,with no disrespect, unless this was a take-off of all mentioned, and even if Charisse's voice was dubbed, \"La La Land\" fails miserably. \n\nI have seen some talk about it saluting Jacques Demy and Michel Legrand's movies \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" and \"The young Girls of Rochefort\" which it does in some departments such as the production design by David Wasco and the costume designs by Mary Zophres. \n\nRegarding the choreography by Mandy Moore the opening is really a winner but in other scenes she is let down by Stone and Gosling who just don't have it when it comes to doing the steps she has for them. There is one scene where they are dancing in the stars, at the Griffith Observatory planetarium after watching the James Dean movie \"Rebel Without a Cause\", that is more special effects than dancing.\n\nThe music by Justin Hurwitz with lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul sort of get lost except for the jazz music which comes across strong, melodic. The love theme lyrics are still somewhat a mystery to me though it is sung and played a few times.\n\nThe climax lasting about twenty minutes, a recap of what has taken place for the first 100 minutes, jell everything together but, for me, it was too late.I think I would have been much happier and appreciated the movie, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just seeing that section.\n\nJ.K. Simmons, who was in Chazells's \"Whiplash\" and won an Oscar for his role does a brief cameo here while John Legend does an extended one, neither adding or taking away from the movie.\n\nThe bottom line is that \"La La Land\", for me, was not worth the time though I am sure I am in a very small minority. It might have helped if I hadn't seen the Broadway version of \"An American In Paris\" in Miami this past Tuesday where the leads were amazing dancers and strong singers.\n\nP.S. When will the fad of young actors wearing that 5 o'clock shadow stubble on their faces end? ARGH!!",

            "content": "What is worth more? Where does ambition measure when compared to reflection? Or...how does one know when to quit? When that ambition outweighs or cannot be met by the pure skill or natural talent possessed? La La Land is a movie about Hollywood and the Hollywood system and how it all flows in and out of making and breaking stars, but La La Land is also a movie about dreams and the ugly side of those dreams no one likes to talk about when they tell you to chase them-compromise. Compromise is what must be obtained if one is hoping to have their cake and eat it too. There is compromise in life no matter what professional or personal route one may choose to take, but when dreams are big enough to take you around the world and on extended stays in places away from home that require long or odd hours such as, say, when someone is a musician or film actor-compromises are unavoidable and typically made by the half of the relationship not actively participating in such a career. With La La Land director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) follows up his Academy Award-nominated feature debut with an out and out musical in the vein of those golden age Hollywood musicals from the forties and early fifties that personified stardom, celebrity, and a certain type of lifestyle most could only hope to obtain. This goes well with the plight of the story as we follow two young aspiring artists-the girl an actress and the guy a jazz pianist-as they navigate modern Los Angeles in hopes of achieving their dreams even if the odds seem stacked against them and despite their closest friends and family not exactly holding out hope for success to find them. The standard structure of boy meets girl combined with that of a few song and dance numbers that pay homage to those aforementioned golden days of Hollywood aren't enough for Chazelle though. The writer/director isn't simply looking to recreate images and feelings afforded him during his youth as he watched Gene Kelly dance across the screen, but more he is interested in exploring the consequences of having such aspirations; the dark side of fame that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with addiction or other harmful habit forming activities, but more with the decisions such individuals have to make without knowing the answer as to what they'll regret more twenty years down the road. Can I be the person I want with the person I want? Is it worth more to make a life as I so desire or with the one I desire? La La Land doesn't prescribe to know the answers to these heavy questions, but its musings on the subject are infectious and reaffirming in that they capture the struggle one in a handful experiencing the film will have come face to face with at some point in their past.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

Now we saw an aspiring actress give up on love to follow her dream. The difference is that the character being given up on in this film has a more of a fleshed out role. The message is the same in Chazelle films: follow your dreams at all costs because love can wait. La La Land is a stronger piece of film than Whiplash, but I would argue that Whiplash is more original. As a filmmaker, Chazelle has successfully made a revamped version of his first film; however, he is embarking into familiar territory. He needs to examine more important social issues and conclude with a message that's relevant to more than just a college audience.",

And musicals, as a genre, is on a retreat in Hollywood; as the saying goes, \"they don't make movies like this anymore.\" Frankly, I didn't think I would be watching La La Land when the trailers landed. But the Golden Globes wins inevitably caught my eyes, I decided to give it a go and boy it was an absolute delight! I am a photography enthusiast, and the cinematography here was top notch, to say at least. The story flowed, without many complications or hiccups, banking on the ensemble cast and looking gorgeous as usual. But beyond the charming visuals and a smooth storyline, it was the music that held the whole enterprise together. The original soundtrack feels full of life and grace, sprinkled with peppiness and a hint of melancholy. I seriously can't just leave them be and still listening to them every other day. The epilogue was perhaps the masterstroke, starting with an emotional could-have-been filled with joy that was struck by reality and slowly faded away to silence. Highly recommended, especially for people who claim to hate musicals.",

While the music was fun and creative, the songs were implemented at odd times - making you zone out and say to yourself \"what the hell is going on.\"\n\nHowever, on reflection, it's very catchy and actually quite fun, romantic, and pleasing. It is one of those movies that you really didn't want to like and succumb to it's cheesy musical numbers, but you inevitable fall into the trap - singing the songs a week later and reminiscing on Gosling's charm and Stone's cute awkwardness.

Dreamers in a landscape of failure find each other and push each other to find success.  In that they find love and what appears to be key to the their success with one surprise at the end.  Dreamers don't always get what they want.

            "content": "<< 3.5 Stars>>\nIt came (FINALLY!  Have been waiting for it to be released since TIFF in September).\nI saw.\nI liked.\nDid I love LOVE LOVVVE it like I thought I would?  No.  But it was cute and quirky with psychedelic cinematography, stunning set designs and a couple spectacular en masse musical dance numbers.\nA colleague shared with me a review he read which stated you will be hooked within the first 3 minutes (kinda paralleling the 'grab your attention' hook tactic utilized in Gravity with it's first 10 minutes).  And honesty, the first 3 minutes are arguably some of the best minutes - along with the biggest pop-up-book scene in La La Land - exploding into a huge, captivating dance number involving at least a hundred amateur signing dancers on a gridlocked ramp exiting off the Los Angeles' freeway.  (See the attached link to a breakdown of the opening scene http://ew.com/movies/2016/12/21/la-la-land-freeway-musical-number-damien-chazelle/).\nConsider me hooked.  I loved LOVED LOVVVVED the 4th wall breaking, stunningly choreographed (by Mandy Moore from So You Think You Can Dance acclaim), energetically composed original song dance number.  So bows and applause to you - 31 year old (WHA??) director Damien Chazelle and your crew for the massive undertaking it was that literally mesmerized my dancing shoes off.\nThere are a few other sensational, imaginative (with subtle homage winks to classic musical movies) razzle-dazzle numbers:  the jump-into-the- pool party number; Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's first semi-Singing-In-The-Rain / I-Love-Melvin re-imagined dance  number. \nLa La Land integrates throwbacks, tributes and adoration to so many things (such as the jazz music genre; 1920's thru 60's Hollywood movies; classic musicals; great actors and actresses; vintage posters and cinema memorabilia) that I stopped counting as I became too engulfed in the intrigue and intimacy of EVERYTHING that La La Land is.\nAnd there is a lot.  Including  the modernizing-yet-old-school film making influences and approaches  undertaken by Chazelle (who wrote and directed the darkly brilliant Whiplash - his Oscar winning, first-time directed film).  Including the absolutely eye-popping technicolourful set designs, costuming ,and make up (though Ryan Gosling did spend most of the movie looking greasy and grimy and ... dirty).  Including a gripping performance from a fellow ginger I love - Emma Stone - whose oscillating emotional range in the film reminded me of an ECG monitor of a patient on speed.  Including the re-teaming of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone from Crazy, Stupid Love (which I loved, no punning) who have so much onscreen chemistry that it could spark forest fires in Alaska.\nHowever, La La Land - in my own humble viewing observation - wasn't perfect.  I know I shouldn't expect perfection - obviously.  But with Whiplash being a critical favourite; with Ryan and Emma coming together again to sing and dance and kiss and be cute; with an opening number that would top any Oscar opener EVER; high hopes for La La Land were inevitable.\nEven though Ryan Gosling learned how to play the piano in thirty days, his singing chops are ... underwhelming (aka weak) at best.  Emma Stone's notes were a little more fuller, but still not ear popping.  Which I understand may have been on purpose due to: (a) Chazelle wanting a nuanced, \"real life people\" singing-in-their-showers sounding actors; and (b) hiring true singer actors would have turned the flick into Chicago, Les Miserable or Momma Mia rather than Moulin Rouge.   Casting non-signer actors though works both ways here: both good and bad.  Good because we cinema goers who cannot sing well (or *finger pointing at me* at all)  can relate to Ryan and Emma, and be absorbed into the film for - as much as we want to burst out into Grammy award winning signing - we don't have the vocal chops to do so.  On the negative flip side, since La La Land is technically mostly a musical, when both are signing it lowers the total enchantment level and impact of the scene/movie.\nPlus, I don't know if it was the theater we were in, or the quality of the sound production, or the quality of the movie itself, but the sound editing dub-ins of the signing and the piano playing was obvious, and, at times, not in-sync to the mouth and finger movement of what we saw on screen.\nLa La Land is definitely a standout for Emma Stone's (as was 2014's Birdman).  Ryan Gosling's performance was - even with mastering the piano - more one or two note.  Which is  sad, because I love him and he can be outstanding (in the aforementioned Crazy, Stupid, Love; The Big Short; Drive; Half Nelson; Lars and The Real Girl; and my fave Blue Valentine).\nAfter the blockbuster opening sequence (still can't stop praising it), the energy and exciting electricity wains; tempering and toning down into a clich\u00e9d relationshippy love story between Ryan's Sebastian and Emma's Mia.  Which is completely fine and understandable with me.  But ...  as the movie progresses, you can feel La La Land's mood and perkiness deflating; which results in the film feeling drawn out, long-in-the-tooth and lackadaisical in comparison to the prior high(er) octane musical stunners.\nAlso, I feel that Chazelle's directorial youth and greenness peeks through at times (this is only his 2nd directed and 4th major written film), with jarring, quick-cut direction/editing that harks back his style in Whiplash but feels out of place here.  The celestial fantasy dance number in the observatory is cute and whimsical -  a nod to another movie that I can't place -  but I don't feel it has the successful effect I know both Chazelle and I were hoping for (not too sure if it was the sub par special effects; the real life cable lifting logistics/handling; the range of moodiness it tried to cover; the obvious fact  dancing-doubles were used for Ryan and Emma).\nWere the above quibs enough to make the film a disappointing letdown overall?  No, definitely not.  \nWas it as mindblowing and memorable as what I was hoping it would be (especially with that AMAZING opening number)? Sadly, no.\nWas it entertaining, cute, charming, adorable, flashy, vivid, musically toe-tapping, feel good movie of 2016?  HELLS to the YESes.  Hands down.  Also worth a second viewing.",

            "content": "\"They don't make em like this anymore\" is the thing most people will say when they leave the theater as the credits roll on La La Land, and they're right. La La Land is a 1950's movie musical, made in 2016. It's an absolutely romantic experience in ever sense of the word. Romantic in it's visual scope, blazing off of the silver screen in Technicolor. Romantic in it's gushing, devastating appreciation for the art of Jazz. Romantic in the on-screen chemistry between Gosling and Stone, who make a sizzling hot couple for our times. I got a Seldon/Lockwood vibe, for sure. We've all heard the hype this film has been getting, and it's for a pretty good reason... \"They don't make em like this anymore\". Damn right, they don't. La La Land resurrects an era of filmmaking that many have thought to be long dead. It's reinvigorated a filmgoing spirit that once dominated the entire industry, and by any luck, might just dominate it once again. You can thank Damien Chazelle, who in one decade, cemented his name into film legend, and may almost certainly walk home with a shining Oscar this year.\n\nSo with all of this in perspective, did the film blow me away. Sadly, I have to report, that it just didn't give me that perfect experience that I wanted. It's a great film, without question, but the problem is.. I've seen this musical. Singing in the Rain is my favorite musical of all-time. I've had that lighter than air, skip in my step, heart singing feeling before, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing. Many people, especially millennials will be feeling this for the first time with La La Land, and that is something that I deeply respect. It's remarkable that films can still do this to people, in our jaded, desensitized, and often cruel world. Perhaps this is what people needed after enduring the unusually dark and divisive year that was 2016. A film like this needed to come along and lift our spirits up, and that's precisely what La La Land does.\n\nIt's a feel-good romp, and we get this right as the film opens, with an absolutely swinging musical number on top of a disgustingly busy LA highway. I loved, loved, loved the music. It's absolutely the film's strength above all else. I'd give it two years time before La La Land ends up becoming a hit Broadway musical that gives Hamilton a run for it's money. Oh yes, it's that good.",

As such, a wholly original musical written specifically for the big screen is a rare beast indeed, and damned if writer/director Damien Chazelle (fresh off 2014's triumphant 'Whiplash') doesn't knock his passion project out of the park. Much of the credit belongs to the undeniable chemistry of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, paired for a third time after 'Crazy, Stupid Love' and 'Gangster Squad'; as aspiring artists (she a budding actress, he an uncompromising jazz pianist) scrambling for their first big breaks in Hollywood, this winning twosome are utterly charming, gamely embracing every element - the singing, the dancing, the quippy repart\u00e9e - thrown at them. Gosling in particular is a revelation here: far removed from the blank stares that used to pass as performances in past roles, his recent comedic work has clearly helped him evolve into a more nuanced actor, resulting in his dazzling work in 'La La Land'. Refreshingly free of irony, Chazelle's confident script strikes the right balance between music and drama, never allowing the breathlessly-staged musical numbers to overwhelm what is, at its core, an unabashedly romantic tale of young love in the City of Dreams. Believe the hype: 'La La Land' is one of the brightest movie gems of 2016, a glorious throwback to Hollywood's Golden Age that feels remarkably fresh today.",

            "content": "With 2014's WHIPLASH, writer/director Damien Chazelle announced himself as a gifted filmmaker on the rise.  With LA LA LAND, he firmly establishes himself as one of the strongest young artists working in cinema, one with a authorial voice and a command of technique.  LA LA LAND is a wonderful, gloriously old-fashioned experience, and it fires on all cylinders with nary a false step taken anywhere along the way.\n\nIt's a relatively simple tale: Mia (Emma Stone) is a struggling actress looking for her big break in Hollywood.  Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a frustrated jazz pianist fighting to keep classic jazz relevant.  Mia and Sebastian's paths cross a few times, and before they know it, they're romantically linked; we follow their separate and shared struggles as they seek out their dreams, accompanied by wonderful musical numbers that jump right off the screen. \n\nThere's no way I could possibly hide this, so I had better get it out right here:  LA LA LAND is a movie that affected me in a deep, emotional way.  Setting aside the craft of the filmmaking (which I'll eventually get to), this wistful story about pursuing dreams is potent and moving, and its longing, almost bittersweet edge should resonate with anybody struggling to figure out what they're doing with their lives, or questioning if they've made the right decisions with respect to going after what their hearts really want.  As one of the lyrics of the movie's most powerful song says, \"Here's to the ones who dream,\" and the entire film itself feels like an ode to perseverance and the classically romantic ideals of being true to oneself in the face of adversity.  It's an enormously optimistic movie (though tinged with some melancholy), and one that feels almost as if writer/director Damien Chazelle is speaking individually to members of the audience and saying, \"Keep going after the things you want to achieve.  It's worth trying.\" \n\nThough there are a handful of supporting characters, the movie lives and dies on the shoulders of its two protagonists.  Luckily, Gosling and Stone are more than up to that task.  Gosling brings a wonderfully understated (almost dry) sense of humor to his role, coupled with a genuine passion for jazz which motivates him at every tun.  He also appears to do his own piano playing, which - considering the intricate nature of the music - is no small achievement.  It is Stone, though, who is the true revelation of the movie; her performance here is the best of her career thus far, a luminous, vibrant turn powered by equal parts determination to succeed and insecurity over her real worth as an aspiring actress.  Stone's been on the edge of the so-called \"A List\" for a while, now, but her work here should surely push her over the top.  It's perhaps my favorite performance of the year. \n\nI've seen some describe the movie as a \"love letter\" to Los Angeles, but I'm not sure I really agree with that.  The film is quite clear-eyed about the complexities and downsides that the city has to offer those who go there to pursue their creative endeavors.  Though the city itself is photographed in an evocative, sometimes dreamlike way, this actually serves to underline the more honest realities the narrative presents about its locale.  Chazelle's story, fundamentally, is not a fantasy, even as it includes fantastical elements.\n\nWhat the film very definitely displays is director Chazelle's range as a filmmaker.  The bluster and ferocious intensity of his previous film, WHIPLASH, are replaced here by sensitivity and exuberance, but the energy is pitched at just as high a level as it was in WHIPLASH.  This is a movie riding high on the love of cinema and music, and on the power of those two art forms when fused together.  It's unabashedly, unashamedly old-fashioned in the way it approaches its musical elements; this is a movie that is in-your-face with its big song and dance numbers.  LA LA LAND is no reinvention of the genre, no meta commentary.  It very much takes its cue from classic musicals and transplants that ethos into 2016.  The result is a spectacular entertainment of the sort we don't really get much anymore.  The songs, courtesy of composer Justin Hurwitz and lyricists Benj Pasek & Justin Paul, are often infused with jazz sensibilities that wouldn't feel too out-of-place in one of the brighter musicals of yesteryear, and the dance sequences are totally old-school in choreography, but are captured through Chazelle's dynamic (and impeccable) camerawork.  Some of the numbers appear to unfold in long, unbroken shots, something that often has a dazzling effect when you realize how long shots have played out without cuts.  \n\nActing as both a glorious homage to classic cinema and an incredibly vital, energetic modern work, LA LA LAND is simply a powerhouse.  It didn't give me exactly what I wanted or expected... it gave me more, and it's one of the very best films of 2016.  I can't wait to see it again.",

Director Damien Chazelle has made a huge step forward as a filmmaker by making a modern-day musical. Each song and dance number is staged with an eye for detail, pulling you into the story. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, who perform these numbers, are absolutely stunning to watch. Not only do they have beautiful singing voices, but they have charming chemistry together which makes you believe they are a couple. Despite it's overlong running time, \"La La Land\" offers an unforgettable cinematic experience that is unlike anything I've seen this year.

            "content": "It begins with a traffic jam, a sticky ribbon of car horns and radios on a Los Angeles freeway. As the cacophony of daily Southern California frustration picks up, edging to a boil, a tanned beauty in a sunshine dress pops out the car door and bursts into song. The score, Justin Hurwitz's \"Another Day of Sun,\" is of love sacrificed for dreams of fame and fortune; it foreshadows the tale to come. Before we know it, a serious song-and-dance number is happening amid commuters leaping atop a sea of standstill cars in one of the best movie-musical performances of the decade. \n\nIntroducing us to the strivers packed into contemporary Los Angeles, each of these seekers drives through the traffic alone, hoping, desperately, that their ten-second performance just might catch the eye of someone who can make them a star. Up for grabs are roles in Damien Chazelle's La La Land, LA's antiquated nickname from a by-gone era of impromptu dance and straightforward romance, and each would-be performer seems to outdo the last. Of course, we never see any of these talented commuters again, but, among them, we do find our leads - a Prius-driving Emma Stone as struggling actress Mia and Ryan Gosling as the frustrated piano-playing traditionalist Sebastian. They flip each other off on the freeway as Sebastian swerves past Mia, and so begins the combative romance that follows.\n\nAs fate would have it, Mia is lead to Sebastian's piano again and again as the purist prodigy plays gigs featuring Christmas tunes and 80s covers. The relentless clich\u00e9s that formulate the exasperated artist's creative hell of making ends meet keep him focused on pursuing his life-long dream of opening up a jazz club. That is, until he meets Mia. The small-town girl who put it all on the line to pursue her dream of playwriting and acting, Mia is trapped as a barista in the Warner Brother's studio lot, running from audition to abysmal audition, just praying for a call-back. Unlike Seb, Mia has lost sight of her childish dreams and would now take any role offered to her, from vampire sitcoms to OC knockoffs.\n\nIt isn't until the two find each other that her passion is re-discovered, and the tension between careerist reality and purist dreaming is moved to the forefront. The chase-your-dream dogma is, as the title suggests, fantastical in nature but also antique in the way Chazelle unpacks it. Whether the old school jazz or the 50s pin-ups, nostalgia permeates every corner of La La Land, but, as Seb so eloquently clarifies - \"Why do you say 'romantic' like it's a dirty word?\" - it's not wilted as much as gutsy, offering insight that sometimes the old ways are the best ways, that we can change with the times without compromising who we are.        \n\nIf a musical is composed of singing, acting, and dancing, then Sebastian is the musician and Mia is the actress, while their budding relationship is the dance that unfolds. We see this in the places our protagonists gain strength - Sebastian, from his music and Mia from the mirror, but, most of all, we revel in the rhythm of the dance found in almost every pivotal moment of their relationship. It is not until Mia takes off her bright blue heels to put on a more comfortable pair of tap shoes, which, low-and-behold match with Sebastian's, that the two fall hopelessly in love with each other. From Griffith Observatory, where Mia flies over the moon, to an emotional tumble into the River Seine, the depth of their relationship is explored through dance that is, at first, combative, later, synchronic, and, ultimately, heart-wrenching. Unlike many recent movie-musicals, the song and dance of La La Land, although not necessarily remarkable, adds a layer of richness that places it squarely among the best films of the year. \n\nRelatable by reminding us of our half-forgotten dreams and repressed passions, Chazelle follows Whiplash with another homerun bound to appeal to a broader audience than the critics and Academy voters who championed Whiplash. And if not, Chazelle certainly doesn't care. A facetious exchange between the leads emphasizes this point - \"It feels really nostalgic... Are people going to like it?\" Mia asks Seb before her play opens. \"Fuck 'em,\" Seb replies - her play, and Chazelle's movie, doesn't need permission. Ultimately, the only person who matters is the dreamer herself.",

But then there were two elements which made me reconsider and think that it may actually be more enjoyable than I think:\n\nNo.(1) Damian Chapelle - after Whiplash I am certain that this director is capable of basically making any movie great. No. (2) Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling - after Crazy Stupid Love, I would watch any movie with these two actors, their chemistry is beyond amazing and it is just a joy to watch them together on-screen.\n\nAnd in fact, all my expectations were met and actually even exceeded. Quite frankly, the opening of the movie reinvigorated my fear of this film being too \"musical\" - there is a highway, there are cars and all of a sudden, people start singing and dancing just like in a musical. But then the movie gives the audience also a real story - of course it is somewhat of a clichee hollywood romance but entertaining nonetheless. And from start to finish, I wasn't bored once and that was mostly due to the fabulous performances by Gosling and Stone who carry the film and the audience. Again (as in my favorite rom com Crazy Stupid Love), there screen chemistry is so good that one wonders why they are not a couple in real life (probably then their screen chemistry would be more like Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez). In the package of your typical hollywood love story, the film actually packages an interesting story about the price one may have to pay to follow their dream. That in fact also made the movie stand out from almost every other Hollywood romance - it defies the meaning of what a happy ending may actually mean and/or entail.\n\nThe other elements of the film which I really enjoyed were the comedic set pieces mostly brought to you so charmfully by Ryan Gosling - as he is this naive dreamer in the early parts of the film who has to perform with bands or gigs he totally does not stand but does it for the money are so wonderfully awkward and can probably only be transported in such a way by Ryan Gosling. And well, there is music - lots of music - but not so much to be annoying. The musical elements were sprinkled into the movie in a really beautiful way; dancing, slow-dance, tap-dance and bad ass concert keyboard performances. My assumption is that all the singing was done by the actors and if so - my hats off to both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. In addition to solid acting performances, they delivered some solid musical and dancing performances on top. And believe me, it is catchy - two days have passed and I still catch myself whistling the melody.\n\nSo if you are somebody who is dreading the idea of watching a muscial but does like some good old rom com and enjoys Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling on-screen together - I can only recommend to watch this film. It will be worth your time.\n\n++++ Find more of my reviews on http://erwinreviews.com +++++",

Written and directed by Damien Chazelle and composed by Justin Hurwitz, the duo delivers another knockout production of musical achievement. Whether you enjoy musicals or not, it's hard not to appreciate the gravitational pull of each magical number. Set against iconic landmarks of dreamy Los Angeles, the story of Sebastian and Mia unfolds in conducted succession. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the defining embodiment of old Hollywood, perfectly paired and evocative of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Where Gosling lacks in vocal strength, he makes up for in charm, while Stone is a bona-fide performer. Together they tackle the pitfalls of love, dreams and everything in between -  a cliched story of sorts if not for the score. Hurwitz's fusion of contemporary and jazz blends seamlessly with topnotch choreography and gorgeous cinematography. Whether it's the captivating melody of \"Mia & Sebastian's Theme,\" the mellow duet of \"City of Stars,\" or even the toe-tapping spectacle of \"Someone In The Crowd,\" the film is not short of memorable tunes. Chazelle directs with effortless precision -  an admirable feat for someone so young. Following the success of \"Whiplash\" and now this second feature, it's suffice to say he has a promising road ahead. While most great films invoke thought and reflection, not all can quite linger like \"La La Land.\"\n\nhttp://cinemadex.blogspot.com/2016/12/la-la-land_80.html",

It then spends its first act as a musical, but it moves away from that in the middle and then seems to remember its a musical again in the latter part of the film. \nThe music is quite repetitive and by the end I was getting sick of the similar chord progression and reused themes being played. Some of the singing was so so, although Gosling is great with the piano miming (which he did learn to play properly) and Emma Stone is great in the film. \nBut the film feels like it was supposed to be a film that played around with old fashioned musicals and would be quirky and fun, but then got hijacked by a director who wanted to complain that no one listens to jazz anymore and he then beats you over the head with jazz music performances. The message of the film appears to be stick to your true passion and work hard on what you want to do and don't do anything else, but that's lost in a sea of artistic choices that feel a bit forced and the film feels like more of a parody.",

But the best part is, in the process of following his love, he didn't leave his passion behind. And as a result, now we are getting best of both the worlds from him. In 2014, it was Whiplash and now it's La La Land.\n\nCinema Musical is an endangered art which needs the audience it deserves and this movie is the need of the time. So that you can say it's not 'The Sound of Music' or 'Singin in the Rain' the last extraordinary musical you have seen but it is this masterpiece.\n\nLa La Land is a story of two dreamers - Seb, a dedicated jazz pianist and Mia, a passionate actress, struggling their ways to make it big. Lost in the city of stars they are waiting just to start a fire. The chemistry of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is just out of the world.\n\nThere is one scene where Mia tells Seb that she hates Jazz. the scene that follows is bloody wonderful and a pure gem as it shows the passion of the character towards the craft he single-handadly wants to save.\n\nFrom the opening dance sequence called 'Another Day of Sun' till the final scene in Jazz club, there's not a single moment in the movie which is dull or lazy. Not a single moment when smile leave your lips. Yes, it may accompany some tears in the final moments of film. Shot in CinemaScope, this movie is full of charm, colour, dance, and music. The innovative use of light is class apart.\n\nMusic by Justin Hurwitz is quite obviously the backbone of the movie which complements the euphoric choreography very beautifully. Both the songs and background scores are written in gold.\n\nThe final 20 minutes sequence of the movie is one of the best movie sequences I have ever seen. Minimal words yet magical impact. These 20 minutes have the potential to be served as life lesson for future editors.\n\nThis movie is poetry in motion, this movie is an experience, this movie is a long beautiful dream, this movie is a modern classic, this movie is a masterpiece, and this movie is here to stay and remembered for lifetime.\n\nGo and experience the magic because movies like this come once in a while. Take my words; money you spend on this movie is your small investment towards the good cinema.\n\nIf only it doesn't fall prey of the Oscar genre-bias, this movie is going to sweep the ceremony.",

A lot of cool cinematography  but that doesn't make up for a lack of well written musical numbers, and a more interesting story line. I also did not like the choice of the actors for their singing. If it's classified as a musical then it needs to have stronger singers. Overall, average movie, interesting features, gorgeous views and costumes, next time focus more on the plot.",

Behind the camera, Damien Chazelle crafts one of the best modern musicals today, balancing the glorious set pieces of the films of the past with more modern, mature storytelling.  The opening number that breaks out in an LA traffic jam is a prime example, along with some sly humor about LA itself, from the the fact everyone has a Prius to, as one character puts its, \"LA is a place that worships everything up to the point they destroy it\".  It's a balance that works perfectly for the story, as the numbers never feel out place while the story doesn't follow cliches (the ending, though uplifting, is not the pat one most other films would have cheated at).

The songs are ultra-generic, but about as good as ultra-generic gets. The dialogue is super tight, the humor is really good half the time and kinda flat the other half the time. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are two super sexy and talented leads, with an okay cast around them. It's attempting to pay tribute to Old Hollywood but only incorporating half a skeleton out of the whole body that is Old Hollywood. There is no over-arching plot, and only one character arch is barely resolved. It's a story about a bunch of spoiled schmucks, but relatable enough that it doesn't come across as the most snotty thing ever. For the genre it is, the visuals are really damn solid.

However the dialogue...that dialogue.  Junior-high loves have deeper conversations than Sebastian and Mia.  The movie needed more songs to drown out their drivel.  The overall plot was also morbid, including a total downer for an ending that should have been the real outcome of their relationship.  \n\nThe only movie I've looked forward to and was disappointed more than \"La La Land\" was \"A Beautiful Mind\", and it won 4 Oscars, which is probably how many this movie will garner.  But the movie could have been so much more, if only director/writer Chazelle would have spent more time on his script and less time on the L.A. glitz.",

Their chemistry was some of the best I've seen this year, and it really made the movie. There was so much great, playful banter between the two that it made you fall in love with them as characters. Gosling and Stone really knocked it out of the park with this one. But I think the true star of the film is Damien Chazelle. As of right now, he is my personal pick for Best Director this year. Everything about this movie was excellently directed. The elaborate musical moments with tracking shots and complex dance moves were done with ease. The personal moments between Gosling and Stone were filmed to highlight the intimacy. The music montages were filmed to entertain entirely. There isn't a dull frame in this movie... \n\nYou can read our review here: http://www.themovieparadise.com/2016/12/la-la-land-review-ryan-gosling-emma-stone-damien-chazelle.html",

            "content": "Damien Chazelle loves too make films about music, even when he's only screenwriting the films, instead of directing them. There's a certain musical influence that's expressed in La La Land that no one has ever done before. Or hasn't been able to accomplish in some time. That's create a movie about the very nature of human's in their relationship to the entertainment industry. The entertainment industry has involved and changed over time. However, it's the efforts of certain people to keep the old still fresh. It's also about those same dreamers accomplishing their goal in today's society. The climate has changed and the movie shows the trend of beauty in the industry dying off. Dreamers can only go so far until their own dreams are crushed, resulting in the dreamers creating their own opportunities.\n\nMia (Emma Stone) is a down and out actress with a dream to make it to the big stage one day. However, life hits her like a bus when in the form of auditions that don't go her way. However, she is still willing to fight for what she wants in life. Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) comes into her life unexpectedly and both of them discuss their dreams of becoming who they are on the big stage. The problem is the fact that they're both entertainers with the passion but not the right break that they want. This create conflict within their own relationship with each other. They're conflict with the outside world effects their conflict with themselves. Creating a almost parallel between the industry and the people who inhabit it. The difference is that the dreamer inside them can overcome an obstacle in their way.\n\nLa La Land has done something that no movie before has down. Made me realize that musicals aren't as bad as they seem. Yes they can be annoying and yes they do have a tendency to over do it with the singing. However, La La Land is a treat to be hold. A movie comes only comes along in a lifetime that can capture certain emotions that transcend an entire moment. Like a lot of parts in the film, it short of freezes us in time when things where just much more similar; where dreams could be brought into real life. That's what's special about La La Land and what some people won't get when coming out of the film. Some people might underestimate and look past the wonders of what truly makes the film one of the best of the year.\n\nThe film isn't something to be looked at as a spectacle. Gone is the flashy dialogue, the awesome special effects, or even the realistic tone of the film. However the short of creepy aspect of the film, more along the lines of how it plays itself with the leads, doesn't hurt the film. The film might have two notorious actors in the leading role contributing to a society and industry that short of produces some wrong doings. Though this overlooked by heartbreaking and fantastic showing of human nature. The film is beautifully tragic in the most poetic version it could be. It transcends the very boundaries that are holding it show close together. Sometimes a film comes along that will shock you deeply, and even surprise you with a very emotional movie going experience. This doesn't even come close to disappointing in this aspect.\n\nWith that I\"m going to give this film a big old standing ovation and two thumbs up.\n\n9.7/10\n\nA+",

Emma Stone gives the best performance of her career, while Ryan Gosling pales in comparison. Pacing and some character development didn't work for me, but the overall feeling of the film was, like LA, magical with a side of bittersweet. I resonated deeply with the underlying conflict of love and self-actualization. It's probably going to be an Oscar contender like 2011's The Artist for its nostalgic value with critics, though I think Moonlight is the more successful film, and even Whiplash was a tighter assembly. But Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz deserve all the praise and attention for this fearless spectacle.",

It's brilliant, sweet, and fun and I am in awe of how they pulled it off.\n\nIt's expertly executed nostalgia for a time none of us actually experienced (I think that's called homage). It will convert anyone into a fan of old Hollywood and classical jazz music.\n\nThis movie knows what it is and isn't afraid to show off its style and give it some flair. It lets you know right from the start what it's all about with a big colorful musical number in the middle of LA traffic. Lots of color is on display and everyone's outfits are monochromatic for some reason. As things get more serious the colors and the musical numbers fade. This I liked because singing and dancing always felt out of place for me when characters are sad or frustrated.\n\nLa La Land is not a pretender. The references to classic Hollywood and Jazz really come across as authentic homages. A rare feat when you consider how often elements from the past are used for comic relief or satire in modern film.\n\nIn a time when block buster films have to be dumbed down for the easy translation and mass appeal, I really appreciate smaller movies that can be different and imaginative. Lala Land is not afraid of showing rather than telling and it's free to be esoteric with its references. Calling it niche night a bit too far as classic Disney films mine the same musical and film sources as La La Land.\n\nActing, as expected, was superb. Characters were great for the most part, the romance was believe and the chemistry was plain to see. Emma Stone's Mia was not always likeable and as the film ended, you wouldn't be wrong to think of her as selfish.\n\nFinally, there are rumbles of cultural appropriation and using people of color as window dressing. I mention this because I am aware of the criticism but I don't really know how I feel about it. At moments throughout the film I felt this was a little uncomfortable. At the same time it's clear that the director Damien Chazelle absolutely loves jazz and it's so prominent in all his work. \n\nIt's complicated, but Chazelle has created something special in La La Land, and I'm always more willing to overlook possibly gray areas when the content is this good.",

            "content": "Sometimes we look to the movies to provide escapism. We want to get away from our everyday life for whatever reason it may be. We can disappear into another world with relatable characters to live out some fantasy for two hours. La La Land will be that movie that sweeps you away from your troubles as you fall in love all over again with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Maybe it's just the music theater side of me that geeked out over the beginning as we see both characters stuck in the typical Los Angeles traffic. Cars are stopped for miles with no one moving anytime soon. It's right then and there where all of the passengers get out of their cars for a little song and dance routine. It's perfectly acceptable in the world of La La Land where everyone busts out at any given moment for a musical number where they can all sing and dance flawlessly. I often have these mental moments where I wish we lived in a musical.\n\nEmma Stone plays Mia, an aspiring actress and professional barista hoping for her big break. She's having the typical bad day where coffee is spilled on her; she's late for an audition, and now stuck in traffic. Been there, done that. She has an encounter with Sebastian (Gosling) on the freeway during the opening musical number but doesn't realize quite yet that she will run into him later on. He is a jazz pianist looking to play in fancier gigs but is stuck playing Christmas carols at a local restaurant. Mia happens to run into him playing there on her awful day. Before she has a chance to introduce herself, he bolts out of there after getting fired. The seasons change and more time passes before Mia runs into him again at a pool party. He's there playing keyboard for an '80s cover band. They finally strike up conversation and begin dating. The rest of La La Land follows a year in the life of these two artists who struggle to find that balance of keeping their relationship healthy while trying to keep their careers afloat.\n\nIt's very easy to get swept up in the whimsical nature of watching Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone fall in love. This is their third film together following Crazy. Stupid. Love (2011) and Gangster Squad (2013). The chemistry is infectious and they make their relationship on screen look so effortless. Mia has that spunk that Emma Stone is great at which makes for playful banter between Gosling's Sebastian who has a bigger temper than she does. The whole beginning of the film as we watch their relationship grow looks like it's set in a watercolor painting. The opening musical number \"Another Day of Sun\" is a rainbow of solid colors. It then progress into sweeping strokes of blues, purples, and oranges that accompany the glow of the moonlight and the picturesque world around them. It's as if you are transported back to the days of the old MGM musicals with Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. It's a warm juxtaposition for a story that actually takes place in the modern day where cell phones, iPads, and gluten-free pastries are the new norm.\n\nWriter and director Damien Chazelle turned to his Whiplash composer Justin Hurwitz to write new and original music. Like that film, they turn to the music to help tell this story and fit the mood and atmosphere of Mia and Sebastian's relationship. There is constant underscoring ranging from simple piano and string compositions that float along to edgy jazz riffs. There's a seamless transition between the two where you may not notice the music changing shape as their relationship begins to grow and change. The lyrical and dreamy dance numbers fade away as their relationship continues to settle into reality.\n\nLa La Land can be taken at face value as a romantic musical with the \"la la land\" signifying the silly headspace we get in when we meet someone and fall in love. The rest of our life gets put on the sideline as we sing and dance with happiness. Chazelle takes it to another level beyond that as a metaphor for what it's like to be an artist. If you've ever tried to make it as an actor in a big city whether it's L.A., N.Y., or another place, you remember those beginning days where you felt like you could conquer the world. You were prepped for an audition and you gave it your all. After years of struggle, you realize that it's extremely tough work where there are hundreds, if not thousands, of other actors there just like you. L.A. can be the city of dreams or the city of crushing realities. It can make being in relationships extremely challenging when your big break or even getting a job can distract you from the ones you love as we find with Mia and Sebastian's relationship.\n\nYou can't get more romantic than Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling which makes the romance of the film all the more palatable. Both of them play into their strengths as actors making it seem like singing, dancing, and playing the piano come second nature to them. Stone infuses Mia with the natural spunk that I love about her. There's a natural vulnerability to her while always being strong and full of life. Gosling is in pure Gosling mode, and that's not a bad thing by any means. He has a bit of an attitude but oozes that easy sex appeal, charm, and sense of humor. Between this and The Nice Guys, I think there's a comedic side to Gosling that we don't always associate with him. Joining them in smaller roles are John Legend as the lead singer of a band that hires Sebastian, Rosemarie Dewitt as Sebastian's sister, and J.K. Simmons as the jerk manager who fires him.\n\nDamien Chazelle knocks it out of the park again as he blends genres, styles, and rhythms in a way to put a literal and metaphorical spotlight on falling in love whether it's with someone else, your career, or both. It's a beautiful call back to the old musicals of the 1930s and 1940s. It's modern, yet timeless. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are the Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan or Bogie/Bacall of this generation. I loved Damien Chazelle's Whiplash and had those same feelings with La La Land.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? A pure delight that will make you smile from ear to ear.\n\nRATING: 5 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

Both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have undeniable chemistry that makes you feel all chummy inside. The cinematography is outstanding and the direction from Damien Chazelle is top notch.\n\nPeople that go into this movie with the attitude of \"I hate musicals\" should leave the cinema pleasantly surprised, as each track moulds well with what is being depicted on screen and doesnt feel forced upon the viewer. \n\nI can't rate this movie any higher and I believe not only is it the best movie of the year, but one of the best movies of the past few decades.

Los Angeles is the third central character in the film, portrayed as a city of murals, painted in primary colors, an Edward Hopper print come to life. Not since 'LA Story' has the city come to life so vividly.\n'La La Land' engages in dialogue with other movies either explicitly, such as 'Rebel Without a Cause', or implicitly, such as in 'An American in Paris'. This is the light side of Lynch's 'Mullholand Drive' which also features an aspiring actress whose excruciating auditions are shown in close up.\nRhapsodic, nostalgic, giddy, 'La La Land' was a huge risk that paid off through its execution and style. The camera gently lilts and tilts across the California landscape, elevating story through screen language. The LA sun casts a golden haze over the aspirations of its protagonists in a world where pavements are lined with broken dreams and success is just a phone call away. \nIt is Gosling and Stone who carry the film, Chazelle who exalts it into the constellation of stellar cinematic turns.

            "content": "I left the movie theater feeling very happy after seeing LA LA LAND. Director Damien Chazelle shows his great directorial prowess in this musical that is broadly about the cost of our dreams. Like Chazelle's other efforts, though, LA LA LAND is not just \"about\" a single thing. The movie is about music. It is about romance. It is about progress. Lots of interesting thematic elements get rolled up into the through-line story of two struggling artists (the ever excellent Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling) in L.A. whose frequent, incidental meetings lead them into promising relationship. \nChazelle's writing and directing obviously work together to homage early movie musicals. (The cinematography frequently reminded me of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.) Everything about the technical production of LA LA LAND is smoothly executed and nostalgic to the max, which makes the movie all the more impressive based on the fact that the sequences of the picture are so complicated. LA LA LAND must have been an uncanny directorial challenge, but it looks great anyway. In addition to extended, moving cinematographic shots, editor Tom Cross' cutting work helps to set perfect pacing for the movie and offers the audience smooth transitions from shot to shot. \nThe musical content of LA LA LAND runs through quite an emotional range and Stone and Gosling are up for the challenge of soulfully working with the music. In addition to their sing and dance performances, Stone and Gosling have believable chemistry and each bring their own unique character quirks to flesh out their already well-written characters. Each performer executes a passionate - and, sometimes heart-breaking - character arc. Both actors are, in my opinion, very worthy of awards consideration. \nWhile I am, personally, not as big a fan of mid-twentieth century musicals as some other movie-lovers may be, I could not help but not only appreciate, but enjoy Chazelle's passion for them. Beyond passion, Chazelle effectively leverages the musical form to meta-narrate about process of evolving from innocent, passionate dreamer to professional artist. LA LA LAND grapples with the choices people have to make when the make the artist's journey. The ending is unconventional - a bit unexpected. And it is incredibly satisfying.",

Granted, the film is technically brilliant and nice to look at and features fine performances, singing and dancing.

He's not relied on special effects to make La La Land current and engaging to a modern multiplex audience. He's given us a empathetic premise, a popular but under-used genre, two of the most likeable actors in Hollywood and added a flash of cinematic genius. The result is a simple love story, told through humour, song and dance which delights and surprises as if it's the first romantic screen musical ever made. Gosling and Stone shine, cast for their acting process and credibility rather than overly-projected Broadway pipes. This makes La La Land a relatable tale of aspirations and dashed hopes rather than a hackneyed sing-a-long of cliches. Of course the music is instantly catchy, of course the art direction and cinematography are kaleidoscopic, and quite possibly Chazelle has made the best film of the year.",

We follow the ups and downs of a relationship involving two people struggling to achieve their dreams in L.A.. The film itself tries to mash together fantastical and all too realistic elements, and the result is the tone is all over the place (as is the pacing). La La Land may say things we've heard many times before, but luckily the musical numbers, choreography and cinematography are all fantastic and memorable. It makes you wish the actual story was better. I'd say the first act is the best part of the film (This is where most of the songs occur). Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone also have great chemistry and are too cute on screen (Gosling himself looks dapper as hell). While La La Land may not quite live up to the hype for myself, I'll still undoubtedly find myself re-visiting it just for the musical numbers found within.",

Here's a musical that's not a full-fledged musical, but a tribute to movies, music, and dreams. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have the smoothest chemistry I've seen in a long time, and the movie oozes charm in every frame. The steady camerawork, ranging from long tracking shots to intricate close-ups, is a marvel to behold. Not everyone will like this movie, merely because there is singing involved; but you need to put that aside and allow yourself to be swept away by this movie, because it has the potential to sweep away anyone who's had aspirations to be truly great at what they do and to do what they love. \n\tThe beauty of film is that you learn important life lessons that you carry with you in your personal life.

Paired together for the third time, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have a lovely chemistry. Indeed, everything in the movie is in harmony. It is visually gorgeous and its intimate songs add to the romance of its escapism.

As soon as the opening number was in full-swing, my detest for musicals was affirmed. Musicals are so incredibly unnatural and cancerously happy that it takes stunning choreography and an extremely talented dancer like Gene Kelly to pull it off. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone aren't that great of dancers (or singers in Stone's case), which obviously shouldn't be the case since these numbers are made for the sole purpose of being whimsical and effortless. The movie also takes very long breaks from the numbers to be a straight-up drama. I'd say that makes it inconsistent but I shouldn't complain because the talking parts are the best scenes. When Ryan Gosling talks passionately about jazz or he and Emma Stone argue with weight, their acting shines and my interest is peaked. But then the musical aspect has to go and ruin any momentum. That's mostly because Gosling and Stone don't have the best of chemistry, despite this being their third pairing. Their characters seem adamantly uninterested in each other and then, all of a sudden, they're in love. There's a decent message here but all of the musical numbers (and I mean the dancing/singing ones)  have nothing to do with the ultimate goals of the characters and seem very useless. If they were cut from the movie, it'd be an appropriate length and I wouldn't be cringing in my seat. That being said, this movie is very well-directed and the cinematography is on-point. The actors are honestly very good. They just don't work that well together and their choreography isn't remotely spectacular like the Gene Kelly days. Damien Chazelle can sure write an ending to his movies. However, he's only directed love letters to music (jazz especially) so I really hope he's not a one-trick director and he can branch out from here. Jazz is great and all but musicals just aren't my thing. (2.5/5).",

Damien Chazzel (Whiplash) would have probably been a jazz musician without piquant, instead he followed his dream and today he delivers a movie that is \"The best thing that has happened to cinemas this year\". \n\nSuch heart and tenderness is seldom seen or felt in a movie and La La Land opens up the seventh heaven of pure bliss and it inevitably takes you on a journey brimming with emotions. You would be helpless but feel in awe and admire the kind of pure cinematic brilliance with warm storytelling that would stay close to your heart.\n\nThe movie is set in contemporary LA, we are made privy to a huge pile up on a freeway but an unassuming girl, goes about her way grooving to 'Another Day of Sun'. Here starts off the magic which doesn't end until you endeavour to blast the reminiscence of the flavour that the movie has left you with. \n\nIt is at this point our love birds come across each other but in a bitter manner with Sebastian getting the finger from Mia. Sebastian is a staunch traditional jazz religionist and plays music for a living but has a dream for a jazz band and then there is our dreamy eyed Mia, a wannabe actress trying her luck at Hollywood but with no triumph. These unassuming and unlikely characters, blend with each other, pushing each other for glory, thrive to conquer their dream. Like every other couple, they have their highs and lows and yet they stick to each other and what conspires of their love at the end is tragic. \n \nDamien has a gusto for storytelling. It is ingenious of the director, narrating love in the form of seasons. It's winter and our love birds are having a hard time coping with their lives to meet ends, come spring, it's the season of love transpiring into a crazy and yet emits the warmth of each others company and come fall, everything is falling apart. When there is shortage of words to express, music flows in a lovely manner, clutching the audience in its sweetness. \n\nThe movie has a nostalgic touch with the movie being presented in CinemaScope, which in the times of technical advancement, is least used and Damien does it with elan. The movie is conjured with long shots that can be termed iconic and shots of dim lights, symbolising ones inner emotions. His love for Jazz and his concern for its dying aura is seen throughout the movie, doing his bit to escalate it's magic. The music in particular by Justin Hurwitz, would lighten up a heart filled with melancholy and it reverberates without a flicker. \n\nEmma Stone is the highlight of the movie, carrying off Mia with panache. She's just lovely and is ably supported by Ryan Gosling as Sebastian, underplaying but his character will stay in one's heart for the respect he has to his love, though his love is pushed into oblivion. Surpassingly, Emma Stone sings her lines in the movie and no one could have done better. \n\nIn fact, trying to praise this movie in any manner would be a futile effort because, words cannot describe La La Land because it's an experience to be lived, emotions to be gone through and it will leave you with moist eyes and a smile. They don't make such movies nowadays and here's to the fools who deserve great cinema. \n\nJust go watch this magic weaved by Damien Chazzel. By the way, don't let that 'A' certification hinder you from entering the theatres, a movie for all ages, presented in the most dignified manner. This is what cinema should be.",

            "content": "There are two things that can really win me over in a movie; great music and a great ending.  La La Land has both, and then some.\n\nComing off of Whiplash, one of the best films of 2014, the pressure was on Damien Chazelle to come up with something to top what he did previously.  Not only did he co-write 13 Cloverfield Lane earlier this year, but he finally got to direct his passion project, La La Land.  In fact, the very plot of the film echoes Chazelle's relentless devotion to getting this film made all these years.  And for the most part, the result is magical.  Surely, there's nothing like it you will see this year.  \n\nLike many classic musicals of the 40's and 50's, La La Land's narrative tends to wander into dreamy and surreal territories, but it's at its best when it is simply telling the story of two ambitious artists in Los Angeles, one a jazz musician and the other an aspiring actress.  I think Chazelle's vision would have been fine with other actors, but there's no question that a ton of credit has to go to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.  Their chemistry bolsters this story, and really, is why I cared so much about these characters.  Both of them will be nominated and both of them deserve to be.  Their relationship through triumphs and struggles, may be the best romance of the year.\n\nLa La Land is one of those movies that doesn't really hit you until the car ride home, or even a few days after.  Sometimes the wandering plot and the inconsistent presence of musical numbers is frustrating, but it all leads to one satisfying ending.  So much so that I significantly upped my score because of how hard the ending hit me.  It isn't predictable or easy, in fact, because the ending wasn't what I originally hoped, made me enjoy it even more.  The final few shots gave me a whole movie's worth of emotion, and it made it worth it in the end.\n\nThis is clearly a tribute to the musicals of the golden age of Hollywood and also a constant reminder at the brilliance of Jazz music, but I found the touching romance and struggle of these two artists to be the most rewarding aspect to La La Land.  The beautiful score and equally subtle and swashbuckling songs contribute to one epic theater experience.  I'm still processing how I feel about the film as a whole, but I'm certainly pleased that I saw it.\n\n+Stone & Gosling chemistry\n\n+Music\n\n+Unpredictable\n\n+Satisfying ending\n\n-Middle act wanders\n\n9.0/10",

            "content": "I witnessed La La Land a few hours ago and already it feels as if it was nothing but a nostalgic, airy dream, and I mean that as a compliment. So in awe of Old-Hollywood musicals and romances La La Land is a film for those that think they don't make them like they used to. It's passionate, real and beautifully melancholic. The soundtrack dazzles with energetic original music including a dazzling opening number on a highway, in which dozens of frustrated drivers exit their vehicles and break out into song and dance while singing about their hopes and fears, and a brilliant ballad sung by Emma Stone and a final Epilogue that is awe and Kleenex inducing. The two leads radiate chemistry and the film feels like a modern classic. If there are any true issues it is mostly in the lack of songs in the middle of the film when it focuses more on the relationship. The film sometimes forgets its showstopping roots and instead is more classic boy meets girl story. In the end though, the Technicolor dreamscape that is La La Land sears itself into your heart and its love for movies and music is evident in the way it conveys the hopes and joys of struggling artists who find hope in their dreams. The film will undoubtedly strike a chord with many striving actors and musicians who feel their passion for what they love is driving them to pursue tough dreams. It's a very real message that left me a bit uneasy being in much of the same shoes Mia is in. It hit almost too close to home but its bracing honesty in the creativity and audition process of artists is an aspect of show business that is necessary to portray. Through the highs and lows of its romantic envisioning of an LA fueled romance, La La Land epitomizes everything right with film today and manages to be breathtakingly bittersweet, modern but classic at the same time. Utterly lovely. Rating: 92",

The auteur picked two pitch-perfect leads in the form of Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone whose irresistible chemistry and penchant for the song-and-dance material is fully on display here. Both injecting new life into an petrified genre (the musical) and giving us something to think about, 'La La Land' isn't afraid to plumb new depths and ask hard questions about the nature of artistry and how working artists commit to their crafts everyday as if its life or death. Both stars perfectly transmit their existential crises and when their lips lock in breathless romance, the audience simply has no choice but to go along for the ride. Here's looking forward to Chazelle's third feature. If anything, he'll build yet another world where we won't want to leave.",

It's a love letter to people with passion, to people with dreams,  and it encourages you to never give up.  I'll be listening to the soundtrack every day til I get to see it again.  The music is both catchy and elegant.  And wow, this movie is FUNNY.  I laughed a lot.  The cinematography is beautiful.

            "content": "Only two years ago, writer/director Damien Chazelle delivered his breakthrough drama Whiplash to universal acclaim. For his third feature, titled La La Land, Chazelle reaches into Hollywood's musical yesteryear to retro-frame a musical romance drama into a contemporary setting. Starring Ryan Gosling (fresh off a similarly humorous turn in the underrated The Nice Guys) and Emma Stone (still building on the success of her Oscar-nominated performance in 2014's Birdman), La La Land tells the story of two young artists with major ambitions who by a mix of chance and fate bump into each other in a series of mishaps that evolves into affection.\n\nSebastian (Gosling) is a down-on-his-luck, jazz-purist pianist who hopes to rejuvenate the dying relevance of jazz while paying strict homage to its musical purity in a nightclub he hopes to one day own. Socially acerbic yet dryly humorous, Sebastian is caught between his own ascendant talent, and his limiting tendency to burn down bridges with his un-workman-like attitude. Meanwhile, Mia (Stone) is an aspiring actress working on the Hollywood lot as she throws herself into the deluge of acting auditions that yields less than positive result. They yield a smoldering indifference that crushes the spirit Mia needs to achieve success. These two cross paths in rather unpleasant circumstances that would normally prevent any future bond, but as they continue to interact, a bond forms nonetheless. In that bond, a greater understanding of each other's artistic interests and talents brings them together as they pursue careers in their respective fields.\n \nThrough the film's protagonists, who have the only true sizable roles in the film, themes of ambition and love teeter on a scale throughout. As the film ventures through the rigors of artistic career-building, the sizable disappointments that mount through the journey color the character's journeys and test the boundaries of their romance. Ryan Gosling, while very understated in his performance, conveys his vulnerabilities through the slightest facial expressions and gestures, which were no doubt practiced in his two collaborations with Nicolas Winding Refn (2011's Drive and 2013's Only God Forgives). Underneath his sneer and silence, Gosling emits a loveable quality that is certainly pegged down a few notches from his \"lovable doofus\" role of Holland March in The Nice Guys but still visible.\n\nEmma Stone's more home-sy, real-world performance inspires great empathy for her character's struggles, and major disappointments all of which feel heartfelt rather than planned for some late act resurgence. Instead, Stone embodies a full-fledged character who she infuses with heart that makes the entire film work. Although there is a supporting cast that include musician John Legend and Finn Wittrock, the supporting cast rarely have much to offer beyond the high-concept musical production that involves them, which may explain the film's notable lack of a Best Cast nomination by the Screen Actors Guild. Nevertheless, the film works well enough on the weight of its two leads. Musically, the film fuses its musical compositions, lyrics and score with the performances, characters and themes of the film perfectly, becoming more exemplary of what original songs are meant to do in cinema opposed to the gimmicky end-credits soundtrack compilations that make good promotional trinkets (do you hear me Suicide Squad: The Album?)\n\nAs an overall production, Damien Chazelle comes more into his own as a filmmaker as he weaves together a smaller-budget production that seems like the kind of massive Hollywood musical production that was far more prevalent in the 1950s and1960s. Highly reminiscent of the kind of Oscar-winning films of the past (before the brooding social indies took over), La La Land uniquely harkens to history while planting its feet firmly in the present in a manner The Artist couldn't. Tom Cross' editing truly eclipses his Oscar-winning work for Whiplash given the almost circular transitions, stops, revisited motifs and artistic setups. The bold yet almost simple production design is well utilized by its dancing, and singing cast while Linus Sandgren's cinematography beautifully illuminates color mixed in with celluloid classicism almost in the vein of Paul Thomas Anderson's second phase works (such as Punch Drunk Love, There Will Be Blood, The Master and Inherent Vice).\n \nAs a late-year release, La La Land is a welcome send-off allowing for positive yet not cheaply-sold optimism in the face of a year of uncertainty, death, depression, division, anger, outrage and confusion. By the roll of its ends credit, there is a feeling that a magnus opus has been delivered and it's one that's not a motion-capture of 2016, but one that will live far beyond its time much like the final cymbal crash in Damien Chazelle's first masterpiece Whiplash.",

Mia (Emma Stone), on the other hand, is an aspiring actress stuck in the big city of Los Angeles trying to make it big but is on the edge of quitting. Both characters face endless roadblocks on their way to greatness and it is tragic to see these characters struggle to realize their dreams. Mia, in particular, is brought down to such a low level that it is truly heartbreaking in that may never be able to fulfill her dreams. The story, overall, is about persistence and devotion to one's craft and how that can be very rewarding. I could not write a review without mentioning the fact that this film is a musical. To be honest, I am not really a fan of musicals, however, this movie is gorgeous and the music is beautiful. The songs are never forced and add a lot to the film, in fact, I could have done with a few more because they were so amazing. The acting (and singing/dancing) is performed masterfully by the film's leads. It should also be mentioned that this film depicts the city of Los Angeles beautifully, the colors burst from the screen as do the moving sets on the Warner Brother's lot.

So you might want to take my comments here with that in mind. LA LA LAND was better than I expected. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are very good as the romantic couple. The music is enjoyable, especially the piano jazz played by Gosling.  The plot is pretty basic and seems primarily aiming to reference old style musicals but wrapped in a modern context. The performances of the two stars are compelling and worth seeing the movie for - and the chemistry between them is great. If you really love musicals, you will probably love this.",

            "content": "La La Land reminds me a lot of American Beauty. I know that might seem weird but hear me out. Like American Beauty I am almost certain that La La Land will win the Academy Award for Best Picture even in a year where there are several better films. It will win because it is glib and shallow but fakes having depth by tapping into something in the zeitgeist, a fear of change, longing for nostalgia and a return to a simpler time. Trump's election only cements it. People are living in the perfect moment to embrace a movie like La La Land, but that doesn't mean its really all that good. \n\nLet me blunt. As a musical La La Land just plain sucks. The choreography is high school drama level. The Coen Brothers did better in Hail Caesar and that wasn't even a musical. Not only are none of the songs memorable but Damien Chazelle doesn't even seem to get the simplest concept of what makes musicals work, that songs should at the very least express the feelings of the characters in a way that only songs can, and the best musicals tend to use them to advance the plot as well. The only time the movie's musical numbers really work is when the film is intentionally aping other movies, whether that be Astaire and Rogers or the far superior musicals of the great Vincent Minnelli. \n\nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone do what they can, and she is especially great in a lot of it. The movie's first half is basically the couple meeting cute and getting together and I found most of this pleasant. However, then the movie decides to resolve their mutual attraction by eliciting a startling series of clich\u00e9s that leads to an especially stupid and unearned ripoff of the romantic climax of Billy Wilder's The Apartment (not a musical I should note) and then a shallow montage that is supposed to be a stand in for anything approaching character development. \n\nIn the second half the film did almost win me back. Chazelle starts to explore the themes that he so deftly explored in his previous film, the excellent Whiplash, and the film becomes more than candy- coated romance. He has a dream of being a jazz musician and owning a club, while she wants to be a Hollywood actress. Their attraction to each other is seemingly based on the fact that they both feel a level of passion for something that others don't and therefore can relate to each other. However, the movie also explores if they can have both their dreams and each other. \n\nThe big problem with the movie to me is that Chazelle is positively dew-eyed about his love for jazz. We hear Gosling talk about jazz constantly throughout the movie and it is seen as some noble artistic pursuit that he should never sacrifice by selling out. When he does take a gig in order to make money for their relationship the entire thing seems very contrived and ridiculous because it is this money making gig itself that keeps them apart, and later in the movie his characters is portrayed as practically a martyr. \n\nHer dream, on the other hand, it is unclear how Chazelle feels. Every actor or writer we see in the movie is more or less portrayed as a fame chasing loser. If being a jazz musician is not selling out then being a Hollywood actor is selling out on a nearly cosmic level based on the world this movie exists in. Yet, Chazelle wants to have it both ways because it is because of Gosling that Stone ends up with the chance to live her dream. He literally tells her what to do and then toward the end of the movie takes all the choices away from her. \n\nIt is tempting to label this movie as sexist because of this, but I think it is more thoughtless. It is ironic that people praise this movie for being about the love of movies because like Whiplash what it is really in love with is jazz. The deeper and darker themes are introduced but never followed through on. Take the film's ending for example. Chazelle sets something up that could have been as devastatingly bittersweet as the ending of The Umbrellas of the Cherbourg, but he just can't help himself. Instead he has to beat us over the head with another fantasy montage. This film is a rather average romantic comedy that merely flirts with depth, but maybe its the distraction the world needs right now. \n Moonlight has won more critics awards. Its the best film I have seen this year and it would be a revelation if it won the Best Picture Oscar because it is about a kid growing up poor, black and gay. Choosing either Kenneth Lonergan's exquisite tragicomedy , Manchester by the Sea or Jeff Nichols's simple and narratively subversive film Loving would both be better choices but Moonlight and Manchester By The Sea are both achingly sad, while Loving intentionally avoids all the Oscar baiting dramatic moments that any other director would have put in.",

I suppose if you don't mind your films having at least THREE absurd coincidences, then you'll be fine with this.

We are supposed to believe that they pull over for dinner right in front of the jazz club like that? Such stupidity took me right out of the film for last time. I was then. I now hope Manchester By the Sea wins the Oscar, but I know it won't, because this is exactly the kind of nonsensical mediocrity that won Crash an Oscar. 2016 is going down in history as the worst year for films. There simply weren't enough good ones. Hell or High Water was excellent, as was Loving and Arrival. This writer/director can take his lazy coincidences and shove them. \n\nI really wanted to like this. But after the third coincidence, I lost patience. I remember the same bizarre crap in Whiplash. How this guy is getting his films made is a mystery to me. Go ahead people, love this film and rave about it like it's the best film ever made. Like the character in the film, I hold to my beliefs and refuse to bend to the incorrect mass opinion. \n\nAnd how can you have a film about true jazz while singing these awful uninspired songs? It just didn't work because of that. But since most people are not real musicians, they will be fooled, and it won't bother them. Another phony pretentious film about music by this Chazelle guy. It only worked occasionally, but that's not good enough. I thought Moonlight was the most overrated film of the year. Wrong. THIS is now the winner of that accolade.",

La La Land tells the story of two people struggling to make it big in Hollywood or in the films case \"The City of Stars\" one is a struggling pianist and the other is a struggling actress. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are two very talented actors and they do a exceptional job in this film and to see these two actors take on such different characters than the ones we are used to seeing was great. Another great thing about Gosling and Stone is they actually have amazing on screen chemistry together which is always great. Damien Chazelle is on his way to becoming one of Hollywoods finest directors for those of you that don't know Chazelle made Whiplash (2014) which though was different in many ways was another music based film and was phenomenal as well, I am looking forward to seeing what Chazelle makes in the future. La La Land has everything you want in a movie its got terrific performances, excellent music, beautiful scenery, and a great story. For all you jazz and/or musicals fans out their I highly recommend La La Land for you. Now for everyone reading this and watched/heard about what happened at the Oscars with the best picture category I have not seen Moonlight (2016) so I cannot say which one really deserved best picture however I am sure that Moonlight was a good film as well.",

As someone who does not live in Los Angeles, but have visited the city of starts enough times to call it a second home, the references to what the city offers may be lost on audience members who are not as familiar with Los Angeles.  But La La Land is more than an homage to old Hollywood and Los Angeles.  It is a film about falling in love and the feeling you get the first time you fall in love and how much it is like a musical.  I believe we all have felt the kind of love that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling portray in the film, and to be able to capture that feeling of floating in air and put it on screen is something magical.",

Because of the state of the independent film scene (and this is one of those mid-way movies like Pulp Fiction, where it has its toes in indie and mainstream Hollywood, the latter if nothing else via its stars and setting), movies like La La Land come backed with the kind of hype that usually would be reserved for, say, a Star Wars movie. It also has to do too with the director's previous, Whiplash, being a ride that gives Emotional Rollercoaster its cliched status, since it was the announcement of a director (from my generation/exact age group) swinging for the fences. And La La Land, with its major reviews and festival runs, seemed like another one. And it is, ultimately, a great movie. Could it have been better? Hmm.\n\nSometimes, furthermore, coming right off from seeing as movie and dumping thoughts and feelings out like a raccoon spilling a garbage can at night and scattering the contents is not always \"correct\" as one might say. It may take another viewing, or a few days, to get more of what I felt about it. But I can say that this is a movie about musicals and musical about movies, and usually these cross and twist like it's a dance out in outer space. Chazelle is also bringing a story that is so familiar - artists in music and performance, close enough as the same thing, who meet, have a little push-and-pull at first (they first meet by the usual serendipity of LA traffic jam) - that it could be criticized as a rehash. Hell, we just had a movie come out a month ago/around this same time, Nocturnal Animals, that, if you look closely, isn't too far off (though the endings are VERY different, which I'll get to what is so gobsmackingly JOYFUL about this movie).\n\nGosling and Stone first were paired five years ago in Crazy Stupid Love, and I'm sure Chazelle knew this and bet on it being stronger this time around. Though as a nitpick (and it should be mentioned) Gosling can't sing anything exceptional, Stone can and they know how to dance and bond and kiss and bring the romance out in full force. La La Land would be a beautiful exercise in technicalities, of pulling off all of the care-free MOVIE ideas that Chazelle has (seriously, he's about as geeky in his homage as Tarantino - notice the Ingrid Bergman wall-sized poster in Mia's place and other parts, or the whole use of the WB lot), but what makes it a triumph is that the actors work well together and separately. More than well, they find the truth in the cliches that come with artists-trying-to-make-it and sell it as well as Chazelle's script can get them to.\n\nWhich, perhaps, is the one thing that keeps me from saying 'OMG THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE' (which, again, hype) - it takes you so immediately into musical terrain with its opening number in LA traffic that it's jarring to then go back into the 'real' world, more or less. Songs of course happen, but it's a balancing act, and all the while Chazelle's story points for these two is so familiar as far as the 'What Happens When You Follow Your Dreams in Artistic/Corporate America' thing that it goes into what could almost be dangerous terrain - not embracing and finding a truth in cliche, but just being conventional (i.e. how Gosling becomes a piano player in a group John Legend's got, and this takes him away from his actual 'dream' of a jazz club, and then Stone's Mia's dream of being an actress, etc etc so forth and so on).\n\n... And then the final 15 minutes or so happens, where we flash ahead five years to what's happened with these two people who, at one point, went to the same planetarium as in Rebel Without a Cause and dance and go into the stratosphere of the galaxy (I'm reminded of the French New Wave, a lot, by the way, in how much Chazelle embraces post-modern self-consciousness; if Breathless was his Whiplash, is this his, uh, A Woman is a Woman?) And the two of them have changed, more or less, and Gosling plays a song that transports into the 'what if' and it's... I don't have words for it. It's what the movies are about. It's a magical, wonderful 15 minutes that reminded me why I can stand being around people whispering (like I don't hear you, old bastards) and munching popcorn and can be transported into a completely made-up, empathetic landscape.\n\nMy first instinct is to go for the typical critical bulls*** of saying 'this is \"better\" than this' (that is Whiplash vs La La Land), but it doesn't matter. That last fifteen minutes, and many other scenes and Stone's performance and the dancing and the whole color palette and the cinematography (oh man, I don't care if you're verging from homage into rip-off of PT Anderson, it's so delicious for my eyes to look at), confirms that Chazelle is the real deal, a filmmaker with something to say about the human experience, about what it means to chase that unfortunate dragon known as the \"dream\" of artists and musicians and actors and so on, and at the same time can bring it forward with... soul. It takes a little time, but my instinct is to call this a soulful Hollywood movie first, beautiful homage second.",

From the very first scene, it's hard not to get swept up in the music and feel of this movie. The story isn't that special but the dances and cinematography take La La Land to a whole new level.",

            "content": "Musical Theater buffs, children, and all parents and adults can enjoy this masterpiece, directed by Damien Chazelle. It tells the story of an actress named Mia, who is struggling with romance and finding a job. She finds a pianist named Sebastien who plays Piano, and is struggling with a steady gig and money. After Sebastien (Ryan Gosling) ignores her in the restaurant he was playing in, they start to run in to each other a lot more. They start to realize that they could be together, and they get engaged. Sebastien teaches her about jazz, and they both help each other to become successful, until of course, the tragedy, which you have to see the movie for. I really like how this movie spends a lot of time in the \"musical theater\" phase, such as the opening scene where they used one shot to film a super- spectacular dancing scene. There are also stunning visuals that includes the dancing, such as the part where they fly into space and dance. The singing, music, and PIANO PLAYING is beautiful, especially the original songs such as \"City of Stars\" written by Justin Hurwitz. I also really admire the story, it is very sweet and age appropriate for everyone. There are some very sad parts in the movie, but most of it leaves you to think, \"what would have happened next?\" You may be wondering if I love it so much, why isn't it an 100%? Well, as a film critic, I would say that it changes tones very quickly, like from sad to intense, or happy to chaotic. But I do highly recommend this film to EVERYONE! It is one of the best movies of the year, and deserves some Oscars. Rated PG-13. Ages 7 and up.",

Soon, drivers poke their heads out the windows, begin to sing, and within minutes are dancing on the hoods of their cars - a magical moment made more pointed by the fact that everyone looks and is dressed like regular people we'd expect to see downtown.  OK, then!  We're in for something special!\n\nOr not.  La La Land is billed as a musical, and does have its leads sing a few songs, but director Damien Chazelle seems to have been given only enough budget to stage that one production number.  The rest of the movie turns out to be a fairly pedestrian romance.  It's a year in the life of two struggling artists.  Ryan Gosling is a jazz musician, repressed, playing Christmas music as restaurant muzak, Emma Stone is an actress, making a living as a barista on the Warners lot.  In time, each has to come to terms with the degree they want to take chances or compromise.\n\nWhen I read the story description, it sounded curiously like Scorsese's \"New York New York\", but I knew this was not going to be THAT depressing.  As much as I disliked NY-NY for its abusive relationship, that story had some scope as it covered wild swings in the lives of its characters.  La La Land is microscopic.  It has two key plot points, and tries to stretch that into a full length movie.  Only in the very end, when it enters a brief new magical reality - and a deeper emotional one, did the movie briefly pick up.",

Set in sunny LA, in contrast to the rainy New York City of many of its predecessors, this production follows the recent unfortunate trend of employing big-name actors with not great singing and dancing chops (presumably because big-name actors with those kind of chops are scarce these days), and attempts, somewhat successfully, to compensate for those arguably essential but missing talents with cleverly framed visuals and plot twists. Not to mention the superb acting: Emma Stone shines, to me at least, somewhat reminiscent of a young Judy Garland, though with infinitely more complex facial expression. Forgetting about  the Golden Age comparison, I enjoyed La La Land a lot; I laughed and cried, and it made me both proud and sad to be a Southern Californian.",

A throw-back film in every sense of the term, La La Land reaches back to forgone movie musicals, and Chazelle makes it as retro as possible. He lets the film be carried by the songs and dance choreography, which are all often satisfying, but he also wisely gives us a universal love story too. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have strong chemistry together, even if neither of them of them have refined singing abilities. While the storyline can delve a bit into cliched rom-com territory in the mid-section, it bounces back strongly for the third act, giving viewers an epilogue that's both unexpected and bitter-sweet, and ultimately fully satisfying.

The partially obscured black and white \"CinemaScope\" logo morphing to a unobstructed full color logo gave only a hint of the amazing film to follow. The opening scene with the camera panning numerous cars and drivers stuck on a LA Freeway on ramp, with each driver listening to a different radio station, all of a sudden transforming to a big-time dance number with people using both the cars and lane dividers as props was genius and sets the tone that this film will be a musical and will be different in the ways it integrates the musical dance sequences with the acting.\n\nWe are then introduced to Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) through sequences of the work they do and the things they are interested in. She is an aspiring actress who supports herself as a barista in a coffee house located on the Warner Brothers movie lot. He's a jazz pianist in small club, wishes to own his own jazz club playing traditional jazz improvisation.\n\nThey meet after he honks at her in the opening traffic jam, after she walks into the club he's playing in (just after he gets fired), and again when he walks into her place of work. By the time they walk through the Warner Bros lot, the audience has a strong sense of their path and them as a couple you care about.\n\nDuring the film, we are treated to a wonderful, hopeful story that segued into well-conceived dance, song, and piano scenes by Mia and Sebastian. There are two things that struck me about these scenes:  1) The dance sequences were shot full bodied and all-encompassing instead of a series of composed edits and cuts showing feet, facial expressions, and a whirl of colors and bodies. This is how musical dance sequences were shot early on by the very best (Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly) of this genre. And 2); They did their own work. They did their own singing, dancing, and for Gosling, piano playing. They were strong, real and imperfectly perfect, just like all of us.\n\nIn my book, this just why these talented two are top box office draws and are two of our best. However, a lot of the credit for this amazing film belongs to the clear direction and vision of director Damien Chazelle who showed us his abilities in \"Whiplash\", another outstanding film. Lastly, I loved the old time ending by using \"The End\" at the close of the film, it perfectly bookended the opening,\n\nGosling is absolutely riveting and sublime. His extraordinary talent is so obvious in every scene he's in. He is a excellent pianist, his suave smooth dance movements are a joy to watch and his acting is top notch. He may be nominated for an award for this turn. Stone is wonderful and clearly made for this part. Her hopeful joy, moments of moving sadness and the ability to move from a dramatic scene into a dance scene were exceptional. J. K. Simmons as Bill, in his very brief scenes, was very good. John Legend as Keith, a musical group leader, was strong and a joy to see. Chazelle wrote and directed this film. Because I was emotionally moved throughout the film, I can say he was very successful in delivering his vision.

Don't know why these two are front-runners for Best Actor and Best Actress at this moment. The script *attempts* to be subtle, but for the sake of Oscar voters, it has to spoon-feed. The choreography is basic. HOWEVER, despite all the issues that the film presents, I would have thought of myself as small-minded if I magnify them over the sincere tribute (albeit a bit misunderstood) that the filmmaker is showing.",

Is it the songs all original written by Writer-Director Damien Chazelle? The great performances by Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone? Or the gorgeous cinematography? Tough to tell, but let's gush over all of them.\n\nThe film grabs you by the balls from the opening scene, a song titled \"Another Day of Sun\" (The film's second best song) as everyone stuck in crappy LA traffic gets out of their cars and starts dancing on the freeway. It's energetic, joyous, and so fun to watch. From there we meet a struggling actress (Emma Stone) and a struggling jazz musician (Ryan Gosling) as the struggle to survive in a city famous for making dreams... or breaking them into a million tiny pieces.\n\nThis the Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling show. They both give good performances, both acting and singing wise. However, Stone's singing is a tad better than Gosling's. Still, that's not to say Gosling's bad. It's just Emma Stone gets the film's best song all to herself and she nails it.\n\nThis a beautiful film to watch. The colors just explode, especially in the scenes where Gosling and Stone are dancing. The Griffith Observatory is a real highlight for this.\n\nHowever, the film has one tiny flaw. There's a scene where Gosling and Stone have their big climactic fight and something about it just doesn't quite gel. It feels a bit like conflict for the sake of conflict with nothing in the film really supporting the accusations Stone makes of Gosling. It's not a major problem, but it is the one negative to an otherwise amazing movie.\n\nThe songs rock. The singing rocks. It's gorgeous to look at. It's the best film of the year.

We can only pray that pishycaca does not enter the English lexicon.  \nIn consideration that the big Hollywood musicals came of age as an answer to the depression and World War II, 2016 certainly appears primed to usher in a new era of escapist entertainment where we are drawn, en masse to theatres to forget the troubles of our country and our world.  And while writer/director Damien Chazelle most exquisitely proves he has the chops (\"Whiplash\") to create effective and compelling mood pieces around the struggle for artistic accomplishment AND artistic freedom, sacrificing character and story to that end doesn't always make for great entertainment.  While the musical set pieces offer compelling visuals and a toe-tapping score, they do little to further the story, which is wafer thin at best.  Often clashing between Hollywood homage and modern storytelling, Chazelle seems to offer up his endearing leads as ciphers of struggling artistes, while wasting Oscar-bait actors like JK Simmons (who won an Oscar for \"Whiplash\"), Rosemary DeWitt and even John Legend as one-note character bots written only to serve the our heros.\n\nAnd although Ryan Gosling seems both too young (the aforementioned pishycaca) and too young for the part, both he and Emma Stone do the best they can when presented with a good set of ideas without the narrative and emotional glue to hold it together.  As Stone says to Gosling half way through the film \"it's too nostalgic\" his response is apt  \"well fuck em\".  Indeed.",

That's a none-too-veiled metaphor for what writer/director Damien Chazelle has tried to do for Hollywood musicals with this film -- make them relatable for new audiences. It mostly works, but -- like people who either do or don't appreciate jazz -- I think folks who generally appreciate dancing and musicals will enjoy it a lot more. The skill and craft involved in putting on this entire production is evident from its opening moments. The film's emotional hook comes later on, centered around Emma Stone's character, and a performance of its best song -- really, the only great song. For all the nostalgia and aesthetically fabulous production, the whole thing rests on the charm, easy chemistry and performances of its two stars -- all solid, for the most part. Bottom line, I enjoyed 'La La Land' more for what it tried to do than what it actually did.",

            "content": "A PARISIAN IN AMERICA - My Review of LA LA LAND (4 Stars)\n\nHaving written and produced a musical feature film myself, I know and appreciate the enormous undertaking they can be and how every moment becomes a question of tone and intention.  Sheldon Larry, the director of LEAVE IT ON THE FLOOR, always paid careful attention to the musicality of the camera work and we both agreed that we love musicals that don't apologize for being musicals.  We wanted our characters to break out in song at every possible point and give the audience access to the magic in their heads.  With rare exceptions, CABARET and CHICAGO being two of them, I'm not a huge fan of performance-based musicals.  I'll take a cast singing and dancing on a sidewalk over a stage any day.  \n\nWriter/director Damien Chazelle (WHIPLASH) clearly gets that, and then some.  The magic in his lovely yet problematic LA LA LAND begins right away with a cropped CINEMASCOPE title card that needs to expand full screen in order to announce to the audience that THIS is a widescreen musical.  From there, we're plunked onto a Los Angeles freeway onramp in a tracking shot of cars highly reminiscent of Jean Luc Godard's WEEKEND. We notice little pops of color and the disparate rhythms coming out of the various stereo systems.  Then the sounds all come together and everyone gets out of their cars to sing \"Another Day Of Sun\", a jazzy, staccato song and dance number that swoops and glides around in what's meant to look like one long steadicam shot.  It's a standalone piece of art that will easily go down as one of the classics of the genre.  Cinematographer Linus Sandgren (AMERICAN HUSTLE) creates lovely negative space in many scenes, allowing this film to breathe.  He's also helped immeasurably by Production Designer David Wasco (PULP FICTION), who has a knack for the French New Wave look.  \n\nIt's on this ramp where our protagonists, Mia (Emma Stone) and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) meet not-so-cute.  Mia, an aspiring actor who works as a movie studio barista, and Sebastian, a struggling jazz pianist, perfectly embody the dreamers who fill up almost every block of this city.  As Mia and Sebastian keep bumping into each other, their travails instantly mark them as kindred spirits.  Of course, their starving artist storylines eventually intersect, and no big spoiler here, they fall in love.  Anyone who has ever watched a movie romance will likely guess the ensuing story beats.  \n\nChazelle, who clearly lives and breathes film, wears his movie references on his sleeve.   LA LA LAND clearly owes a debt to the old MGM musicals such as SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, but it especially pays homage to Jacques Demy's 1964 French musical, THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG.  Go ahead.  Watch it online right now and then continue reading.  I'll wait.  Unlike that great Catherine Deneuve film, however, LA LA LAND isn't a sung-through musical.  In fact, it's a little thin on numbers and many of the songs end up sounding the same.  There's a stretch in the 2nd act where I thought he forgot to insert anywhere from 1-3 numbers.  Instead, we're treated to lots of instrumentals, stage performances (cue pet peeve red flag here) and the usual love story complications.  \n\nNone of this is to say it's bad.  LA LA LAND is often great, even masterful.  It has a literal floating-on-air quality, and Stone and Gosling have enormous appeal and chemistry to spare.  While neither of them are belters, they create a wonderful intimacy and in Gosling's case, a knack for a Gene Kelly-like flair for movement.  Choreographer Mandy Moore, a staple from SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE, makes sure he punctuates every turn with just the right hand flip or extension.  He's a natural.  Stone has a very thin voice, but it's all the better to pierce your heart during her eleventh hour number, \"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)\".  Nothing in the film is staged as simply as this song, yet it remains my favorite for cutting to the heart of the movie's themes.  \nDespite a tone of pure joy, reminiscent of that Oscar-winning juggernaut THE ARTIST, this film does have its flaws.  In addition to the aforementioned dearth of numbers in its second act and a somewhat sameness to the music as a whole, I found the John Legend subplot to be fairly ineffective.  Legend plays Keith, a fellow musician and apparent rival of Sebastian's.  His character is set up as an asshole, yet I didn't really see anything in the script or in Legend's blas\u00e9 performance to suggest that.  It seems like a lot of screen time to show how far afield of his dreams Sebastian has drifted.  I also didn't quite understand why Mia leaves a boyfriend (AMERICAN HORROR STORY's Finn Wittrock) in the lurch after referring to him as \"sweet\".  It would have been very easy to give Mia a good reason to dump someone so unceremoniously.  I mean, I was dumped earlier this year via Skype, which sucked, but Mia just gets up and leaves without so much as a word to him.  Mia SUCKS!\n\nA bigger point I want to make about the film is that there are times where it feels more like an homage than a truly concentrated love story.  Yes, the old school musicals featured paper thin archetypes as well, and Gosling and Stone DO give gorgeously detailed performances worthy of every accolade.  Still, there seemed to be a bit of a disconnect in some of the sequences, particularly the early and highly kinetic \"Somewhere In The Crowd\".  Set at a Hollywood cocktail party, Mia and her roommates (barely established) climb the social ladder hoping to get discovered.  The camera bobs, weaves and twirls around to give us the vibe of the affair, but it fails to truly draw us into Mia.  When confronted with the choice of spinning a camera around a swimming pool or moving in close on an actor's face to see how she feels about the environment, I would choose the latter.  Chazelle sometimes chooses the dazzling effect over the character beats.  \n\nStill, all is forgiven by the end where, channeling AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, he produces a dazzling, unforgettable sequence about fate and choices.  Sure, I would have followed this up with a Mia/Sebastian duet, because, well, it's a musical...but Chazelle has delivered a film to celebrate, even if I was just a little bit let down.",

I'm telling you now DON'T.  This film is a surprising achievement that celebrates music, romance, and ambition. If you dislike or even hate musicals, this movie might change your mind. \n  In this film, where the world is inhabited by people who break out in song during traffic jams, we get two souls who fall for each other. Mia Dolan (Emma Stone) and Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling.)  We see them fall for each other and embrace the beginning of their blossoming romance. Not just their love we witness but we see how they struggle with their ambitions and dreams. \n  This is Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's third film together after \"Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011)\", and \"Gangster Squad (2013).\"  They had time to grow together and create great chemistry. This movie is shows how comfortable they are with each other and how exciting they both can be. Gosling's character is a pianist who has an obvious love for jazz,  while Stone's character is a simple barista who dreams of being an actress. They both start at the bottom and we see them grow together. They have many hilarious, fun, and sometimes even sad moments. They are a match made in movie heaven and are amazing in every scene. \n  The director is Damien Chazelle, who brought us the very intense movie \"Whiplash (2014).\" He clearly has a love for music and wants to express it in every way that he can. The direction is phenomenally executed. He uses lengthy scenes that transition into dreamlike sequences leaving us (and by us I mean me) in awe. The cinematography also changes up from time to time and keeps each scene fresh and exciting. The dance choreography is perfectly executed and brings every sense of the word \"fun\" to the screen. Then we have Justin Hurwitz 's music which he clearly put a lot of heart and dedication into. The songs are very memorable, in fact, I was humming one of the songs on the way out of the theater. It's not just all singing either, we also get some great instrumental music as well as Jazz that help add on to this movie's brilliance.  \n  Another thing that I really enjoyed about this film was its message of dreams and the struggles to get there. We observe two lovers who try hard to make their dreams come true. Even when thing's get difficult and sacrifices need to be made. Never settle and never give up on a life you imagine. It's very good at mixing the art of music with the ambitions it's trying to convey. \n  So as I said before, if you don't like musical's this movie might change your mind. There is powerful performances, great direction, hilarious moments, gorgeous visuals, excellent dancing, and catchy songs all leading to a bittersweet ending. It's got the heart of classy 1960' musical while still being a fresh and original film. I highly recommend this, its great fun and breathes new life into a dying genre.",

            "content": "Cinema has been in quite the reflective state in recent times. On a large commercial scale, J.J. Abrams intentionally made 2015s Star Wars: The Force Awakens to channel and homage the films of the late 70s and early 80s, Quentin Tarantino had done a similar venture to create the epic nature and scope of Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s with his masterclass The Hateful Eight of the same year and going a little further back Michel Hazanavicius recreated a silent picture of the 20s with 2011s impressive The Artist. Similar to those landmark treats, Damien Chazelle's excellent 2016 musical opus La La Land is a magical time capsule that transports us to the Golden Age of Hollywood moviemaking while completely modernizing it all at the same time. Written by Chazelle and with music by Justin Hurwitz (who will win an Oscar), the pair have completely interwoven original elements so well that it will become difficult to think of a time when the track \"City of Stars\" didn't exist. Told visually through excellent cinematography (which Linus Sandgren should win an Oscar for), amazing choreography, great costumes (which is Oscar material) amazing editing (Tim Cross, who won an Oscar with Chazelle's 2014 Whiplash, looks to win another), La La Land is a treat on a superficial level but hidden behind all those bells and whistles is a simple story. The plot is very minimalist-about how a striving actress (played by the bright eyed Emma Stone) and a striving jazz musician (played by the cool Ryan Gosling) find romance in the City of Angels-but there is no fault in the minimalist approach because the focus that Chazelle brings in really fleshing out the entirety of the film is exceptional and he achieves in arguably the most difficult aspect of these types of pictures by truly making us care for the two leads. With homages ranging from Frank Capra's 1934 chemistry-laden It Happened One Night to Vincente Minnelli's extravagant 1951 An American in Paris to Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen's witty 1952 Singin' in the Rain all the way to the colorful and melodramatic Jacques Demy 1964 classic The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (this one shares the most similarity), Chazelle has created a film that is aware of its predecessors and lovingly acknowledges them, while doing the unthinkable and achieves to tap dance toe to toe with them. This film has the Technicolor wattage to shine brightest in 2016 and backs it up with grounded humor, fine performances and dramatic handling of the material that never feels heavy handed. La La Land is an experience that embraces the romance of the past, embraces the love of the movies and embraces the power of achieving your dreams-cementing it as a modern classic.",

            "content": "To start with, let me state my bias. 2014 was a great year for film. In particular, there was one film that stood out to me far above the rest: Whiplash. That year, though, Birdman was chosen by the Academy as the best picture of the year, and understandably so. However, Whiplash should have won every award it was nominated for. I cannot heap any more praise than I already have upon it and it really put Damien Chazelle on the map in a tremendous way. Earlier this year he wrote 10 Cloverfield Lane, which is again, one of my favorites for the year. Now with La La Land, he's three for three.\n     La La Land starts out with a beautifully shot and choreographed, over the top musical number clearly reminiscent of the heyday of the Hollywood musical. What put this scene apart from other musicals, though, was his technique and attention to color. They're small things that are used so effectively that the audience might not even pick up on what is happening and the work and attention to detail that is put into the opening. Like Birdman, it's done as a tracking shot, being shot and cut as to appear as one continuous, fluid motion of camera. The use of this camera technique is repeated a few times throughout, so the opening is a fantastic way to introduce the audience to Chazelle's cinematic aptitude. The second aspect of the opening number is the attention to color. Every member of the chorus has their own color, vibrantly differentiating one from another, yet they never seem unrealistic or out of place. It brings to mind Zhang Yimou's 2002 epic \"Hero\", which is criminally underrated. In \"Hero\", Yimou uses color not for ascetic, but for character, each scene and situation identifying itself not just by the events and narrative structure, but also their individual beauty. Chazelle does something similar with color in that the costumes chosen for each individual character aren't there just to have pretty clothes illuminating the wearer, but to paint the characters themselves. All of this is done in just the first ten minutes or so, and it doesn't let up.\n     In Birdman, Alejandro Gonzales Innaritu brought Emma Stone's best out of her, and she received the honor of being nominated for Best Supporting Actor for her hard work. This year, though, she's going all the way to the top and will take the golden statue for Best Actress, guaranteed. She reaches a peak near the climax that is reminiscent of Anne Hathaway's Fantine in \"Les Miserables\", where the entire focus is on her, nothing else, and she conveys such crushing emotion that those who are unmoved by her performance are clearly heartless people. In contrast to Les Miserables, though, Chazelle uses this particular scene far more effectively than Tom Hooper. My largest complaint of Les Miserables, whether the film or the stage production, is that while there are some great high points throughout, the emotional peak is fairly early on at Fantine's \"I Dreamed a Dream\". La La Land, though, doesn't have this problem. It's paced and structured so masterfully that the action and emotion climbs from scene to scene, act to act, so it keeps hitting a new high point over and over again until, in the classic narrative fashion, until the climax comes to a head and everything crashes down in a beautiful conclusion.\n     When it comes to what he's written and directed, Damien Chazelle is two for two and well on his way to being one of the top writers and directors of this generation. Moving into awards season, this is what La La Land is going to win for Best: Picture, Director, Actress, Original Screenplay, Original Score, Original Song (either for \"City of Stars (Reprise)\" or \"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)\"), Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design, and Film Editing, with possible nominations also for Best Actor and Makeup and Hairstyling. Basically, it's going to sweep this year's Academy Awards.\n4.5/5\nP.S.\nI want to give this one a 5/5, but that's a rating I never give and hold at a very high regard, so I'm going to watch it at least once more in the theater to see if it still holds up and can push it into that realm.",

It's got bold colors, great music, Hollywood stars in with that classic charm, great cinematography...it is exactly what you want in a throwback Hollywood musical fused with a little bit of modern sensibilities.  Chazelle is definitely one of the finest young directors in Hollywood today.  This is classic escapism with good songs and romance.",

It is a musical movie and has a lot of songs and singing so if you don't like this kind of movie, dont watch it. The first 1/3 is choppy and clunky but the rest is very good.

            "content": "We are currently in an era of reinterpreting and rebooting old content, there hasn't been much freshness in films for a long time. Films has been around long enough to have explored so many stories and techniques, and film audiences have seen more films than ever that it's hard to come up with something that can leave an impression that lingers for days after watching. Having seen and loved Whiplash, I was really looking forward to Damien Chazelle's next film. The fact that it would be a musical with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone just made me super impatient to watch it. Oh I also love jazz so that just made it pretty much perfect. Expectations were sky high from this team and boy did they meet them. I'm happy to say, I was far from disappointed. Here director Chazelle has made an irresistible musical comedy-drama that serves up a real delight for the eyes and ears. If you haven't heard of this film yet (where have you been?), I'm sure you will do in the coming months. From the films incredibly choreographed opening scene, the film becomes an eye catching, toe-tapping and most importantly of all joyous film going experience and the film transforms a story that at its core is rather generic into something else entirely, that will very likely place this one into the top echelon of cinematic musicals, as well as a classic of our time. Tonally, this film was very different from Whiplash, (one was an intense and dark psychological thriller whereas this was a brilliant, comedic, and emotional romance) but Chazelle's style can still be seen in this film. This film not only leaves a lingering impression, but it also gives you a feeling that you're watching something that will be talked about for a long time. Sure, the film does take notes from the past, however, rather than rehashing another predictable, well-known story, it tells a honest story, which, when combined with the near-obsolete genre of jazz musical, has a lovely effect and is so fresh from what you seem today that it seems strangely, new. This is also attributed to the beautiful use of color and visuals, smooth, old-style camera-work, unexpected plot/editing, and just the right amount of special effects to make it special. The story follows a jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and a waitress Mia (Emma Stone), who aims to break into the showbiz in the City of Angels, without ever compromising its realistic spin. While, Mia is an aspiring actress who keeps struggling from one audition to the next, her daytime job is working at a coffee shop in a studio lot where she can be near her dream, Sebastian is a dedicated jazz musician struggling to make ends meet, dreaming of someday running his own jazz club. Mia and Sebastian meet and fall for each other, but they live in a city known for crushing hopes and breaking hearts. Together they continue to explore the joy and pain of pursuing their dreams. The most impressive thing about the film, for me, is just how daringly it dances between the old-fashioned \"Singing' In The Rain\" style of musical, and a bolder, modern style. The song numbers are great  and are an undoubted homage to classic musicals - a thoughtful mixture of old school dance numbers you'd expect from a musical in the 50s, and emotionally-wrenching ballads that hit you where it hurts; there is one particular sequence toward the end of the film which is a real gut-punch. Here, Damien Chazelle has found a way to reignite the general love for Los Angeles the way \"Rebel Without a Cause\" did decades ago, in fact, much of the film is more or less of an homage to that James Dean classic. The colors, the look, the design, the tone, even though it's set in present day, the characters could've easily been transported from a golden age era. Fully embracing the widescreen splendor, the film's winning opening gambit is a slithering singing- and-dancing sequence on the chockablock freeway choreographed in one dashing long shot. Then the film pans out its narration of an ever-typical girl-meet-boy story (in this case, it is the girl who makes the first move), divided by seasons with a winter-to-winter rotation, initially, the story bifurcates in two different forks until the two finally hit the ground running, interposed with scintillating music numbers which can hypnotically melt your heart and dazzle your mind. Chazelle adroitly centers on two protagonists through and through like in those vintage romantic flicks where you can see haloes around them, anyone, anything else in their world has all duly faded into the dark background whenever their eyes meet, their hands touch, and they kiss. Neither life nor love goes smoothly for this pair of stubborn dreamers, but they sure do try hard at both. Mia continues working as a barista on the Warner Bros. studio lot and going to frustrating audition after frustrating audition. Eventually, she decides that her best way forward is to write, finance and produce a one-woman show which, fittingly, focuses on her experiences of leaving her hometown in Nevada and moving to L.A. to pursue her dreams. After dropping the humorously humiliating job where Mia sees him at their third encounter, Sebastian continues to hold fast to his dream of opening his own jazz club, but doesn't really do much about it. He reluctantly takes a job on keys in a music group run by an old acquaintance (John Legend), but doesn't enjoy it because they don't play his style of pure jazz. Sebastian's unhappiness turns to resentment and ends up being directed toward Mia, just as her show is about to open. The eventual resolution of their love story and their individual pursuit of their dreams feels right for a film which celebrates dreamers, but shows what happens when life doesn't go as we've planned. The lead characters may be struggling in certain fields but it is their dreams they are chasing at the end of the day. Something we all have done or are in the process of doing. This makes you quickly feel like you know these people and what they're going through. Throw in some comedy, love, drama and magical soundtracks as well as sequences and you have yourself a masterpiece. Alongside DOP Linus Sandgren (whose work here may well lead to a hefty individual awards haul this season), and genuinely the whole team behind this production, Chazelle has crafted up that rare film beast, a unique tapestry of brilliance that practically bounces along frame to frame and is matched majestically by its two leads, who in turn give us a duo of characters we are unlikely to forget anytime soon. What also helps is a beautiful score and extremely well written songs. I found myself humming \"City of Stars\" all night long, already saving the soundtrack on every music platform I could. The music and dance numbers are a perfect blend of Gene Kelly musicals and more contemporary stuff like Chicago. The production design helps with this with bright, vivid colors abound from the walls of a passing building to Emma Stone's dress. However, the film does have one flaw - the absence of conflict. Conflict is necessary in any film and with romantic films, the conflict is usually somewhere out of left field and is usually the low point. This film, despite everything else, is no different. The problem is, why we are made aware of what may have caused the major rift, but there is no exact detail. Did they grow apart, did their careers just consume so much of their time they broke up and decided to become friends? Friends which kept aware of what the other was doing but didn't have much communication, this isn't answered. We are just teased with a possible way the film could end which for some maybe unrealistic. Tasked with not only reigniting the chemistry they shared in the likable 2011 romantic comedy Crazy Stupid Love and the 2013 Gangster Squad but pulling off the unenviable task of singing and dancing their way into the filmgoers hearts, Emma Stone as the big dreaming wannabe actress Mia and Ryan Gosling as jazz loving hard-done-by musician Sebastian make for a lovable on screen duo whose relationship together is all at once alluring, believable and at times heartbreaking. Ryan Gosling and especially Emma Stone were absolutely astounding. Both of the stars were able to authentically portray such a vast range of emotion as well as deliver great musical performances. The chemistry between the two actors was great. Gosling and Stone were able to believably play off of one another and it made for an entertaining and emotionally engaging relationship to watch unfold. In smaller roles, John Legend & J.K. Simmons are likable.  On the whole, 'La La Land' is amazing, alluring, magnificent, and emotional making for an unforgettable cinematic experience.",

Both are eccentric.\nRyan Gosling is Seb, a jazz pianist whose purist leanings and ambition to open his own club are hampered by an indifferent world, particularly the chicken-in-a-basket crowd who patronise the supper club where he's the resident entertainment.\nEmma Stone is Mia, a silver screen-obsessed wannabe actress and writer who constantly skips off shifts as a barista on the Warner Bros studio lot to attend auditions which usually end in disappointment.\nThey first meet in a traffic jam on a sun-kissed, present day Los Angeles freeway...but the focus here is a sensational one-shot dance routine where the traffic-jammed commuters jump out of their vehicles and do the show right there.\nA few tentative steps later they re-connect at a Hollywood party (he's playing jazz synthesizer in an appalling covers band) and the sparks begin to fly, particularly after a one-take entrancing set-piece above the glinting lights of downtown LA. It could be 1950 if we didn't know better.\nTheir sunny romance quickly goes into overdrive...but there are stress points. He joins a successful but punishingly hard-touring band while she struggles to reverse her thwarted ambitions as a playwright and Actress. Their lofty Old Hollywood ambitions threaten to come between them.\nDespite the song and dance focus of the film, its heartwarming success is ultimately down to the constantly sparking chemistry between Stone and Gosling. They are also surprisingly gifted dancers and singers and their heart-on-the-sleeve vulnerability lends real authenticity to their faltering romance.\nEmma Stone plays a convincingly strong single women whose underlying vulnerabilities come out at times only to be pushed back down by her dream of life. Her Oscar-nominated work in \"Birdman\" was striking, yet she has never been better and deserves the many awards she is receiving for her performance in this film.\nNominated previously for an Oscar (for \"Half Nelson\"), Ryan Gosling Seb is a charming, eccentric guy who finds romance with jazz and his musical dreams at odds with his romance with Mia. He's a very well-written character played to perfection by Gosling. Without these performances and the chemistry between Gosling and Stone \"La La Land\" would have fallen flat. While surrounded by a cast which includes J.K. Simmons and John Legend the film doesn't give its supporting characters back stories nor plots...the film belongs to Gosling and Stone alone.\nThe authenticity of the \"old style musical\" is brought to vivid life by beautifully designed costumes and production design filmed in authentic Cinemascope. It's a treat to the eyes and ears.\nBoth the score and songs are presented in unmitigated, true original glory. And the choreography is immaculate.\nThe sweet romance peppered by bittersweet honesty is undoubtedly one of the best of 2016, if not the very best.\nSweet-natured in a time of often cynicism, this buoyantly uplifting fable sets the soul soaring and the heart beating.\nDance to its tune.",

The movie couldn't decide if it were an homage to the great Hollywood musicals of the 50's or a parody of the French New Wave. The production designer didn't know what decade to reference so the film clumsily smithed together a pastiche of styles from the 40's through the present, which didn't make sense. The write/director vacillated between presenting a light hearted romantic musical where \"they all live happily ever after\" or if the film were a serious drama - so he turned it into neither. Beginning with an overly ambitious opening dance scene on a congested LA freeway, which looked blown out and poorly shot you will be disappointed. My advice is to wait until it comes to cable so when you get bored you can get yourself a snack and not miss much.",

From the big opening until the song \"Audition\" every dance number exudes joy and will make you want to join in with the people up on the screen.  With \"Audition\", Emma Stone, as Mia, brings the movie into different territory and breaks your heart.  This movie is so much fun, but also enters deeper territory which left me with a profound sense of sadness and melancholy that I have yet to shake, although I saw it 2 days ago.  I am sure my failure to chase the dream was one reason I was so moved by it.  However, I was also moved by the reality that chasing the dream means compromise and conflict and, although this is a movie, it maintains that sense of reality.  It does not ignore the What Ifs that accompany real life.  Emma Stone, as aspiring actress Mia, gives an incredible performance.  She defines the lyrics from the song \"With One Look\" from Sunset Boulevard (not including the bits alluding to the aged out actress).  Stone need not even say a word, with just a look she can break your heart, she can make you smile, she owns the screen - as unassuming and sweet as she is, she is magical.  Ryan Gosling, as aspiring jazz musician/club owner, Seb, can be a little harder to love sometimes, not because of Gosling, but b/c the character is more complex.  Difficult at times, very stubborn, yet then so darn charming.  \n\nThe dance number featured on the poster between Stone and Gosling is so much fun.  Great style and made me wish I was up there dancing with them.  \n\nThe costume design is excellent.  Along with the choreography and music, the costumes have a timelessness to them.  La La Land is set in the present day, but its style is classic. \n\nThe song \"Audition\" is just stunning.  Everything about that scene is heartbreaking and perfect.  Although Stone is no belter, her voice is perfect for this piece.  Everything in this movie is so natural, Stone's singing voice is lovely and fits her character perfectly.  The singing and dancing seem to flow organically out of the plot.  There are many, many aspects of this film that are just superior, in particular Emma Stone, the direction, the costuming, and the song \"Audition\".  I hope members of the Academy take note.  \"Here's to the ones who dream; Foolish, as they may seem; Here's to the hearts that break; Here's to the mess we make.\"",

            "content": "La La Land is a terrific movie--one that stuck with me overnight and had me thinking the next morning. Like Damien Chazelle's last movie, the criminally underseen Whiplash, La La Land evokes strong emotions.\n\nIn some respects, this is an old-fashioned movie musical set in a vaguely contemporary LA (with some hints at Hollywood's glamorous past), but whereas the relationships in old musicals often served the music, in this case, the relationship feels wholly authentic, and the music serves it. This is a romance, but a real one that struggles between complex people with different lives and goals.\n\nLa La Land reminded me in many ways of the movie Once in the way it weaves together music with a truly honest human relationship. It's like a Disney movie that brings two people together through song and dance but then continues to follow them as they figure out what their relationship means and if it can fit into their lives.\n\nThe energy between Stone and Gosling, so obvious in Crazy, Stupid, Love, is put to terrific use in La La Land. Stone didn't even need to say a word--you could just feel every emotion, both joyous and sad, through those eyes. And Gosling plays a man at battle with himself over his passion and his poverty with intensity. As a former part-time jazz musician myself, his character's inner struggles felt real. \n\nLastly, I just have to comment on how lovely the movie is. Somehow Chazelle manages to make the movie seem utterly realistic on the streets of Los Angeles while at the same time giving it a healthy dollop of theatrical fantasy. Much of the film is shot in spectacularly complex tracking shots in real LA locations (including one song-and-dance number that involved a hundred dancers on a closed section of the 105-110 interchange), giving it a handheld and raw feel but also pulling the viewer into the scene.\n\nI hate to oversell movies, but this was clearly the best film I've seen this year (but I haven't seen all the great films yet, including Nocturnal Animals and Moonlight.) Chazelle has a way of making performing music an intense part of his stories--Whiplash's breathtaking drum solo climax plays out the relationship of two adversaries and La La Land's climax has lovers' hopes, wishes, and regrets played out on the piano (and on Stone's and Gosling's faces). The director is only 31 years old, and I can't wait to see what he does next.",

I really love the way Damien chazelle did the shots in the movie he was able to show the classic musical style in this movie so well!\n\n\nNow that brings me to my next thing I LOVED in this movie and that is Damien Chazelle, he did it again! After his great movie titled \"Whiplash\" he comes back with yet another classic film! He directed this movie so well, all the shots were absolutely perfect, I can't wait to see what he does next! \n\n\nI can't say enough about this movie it is so amazing, if you even slightly like movies you need to see this film!! The performances are so good and the movie really tugs at your heartstrings, and makes you really feel for the characters!

Similar to great Broadway plays, Old Hollywood classics, and legends of Jazz, La La Land presents a fantastic ideal that simultaneously connects to the audience as they experience it, an ideal that lingers. If you catch yourself whistling Mia & Sebastian's Theme after you see the movie I'm right. \n\nThe movie reminds me of the power of film, unlike narrative, song, dance, or other arts alone, there's a special something that can only be expressed when cinema elements come together, an experience different from the sum of its parts. \n\nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone both encapsulate, almost stoically, the roles of the aspiring jazz musician and actress. But the chemistry between them, that we have seen before, breathes refreshing life to a familiar love story. Their chemistry's theatrical dynamic delivers a fantasy you might not believe in, but would want to, like a lie that tells the truth more honestly than reality. Their fantasy leads to the realization of both of their dreams, a bittersweet success that reaffirms time and space, to be the most painful and truest evils to love. \n\nThe denouement scene where the entire story is rewritten with regret explosively concludes where the opening musical number begins, and Damien Chazelle should receive another standing ovation for his direction of a story that revolves around the axis of music, resulting in a profound thematic expression.",

As a lover of musicals, I was very pleasantly surprised 1 minute into the movie when I found out it was also a musical! The music was great, the story was lovely and the camera angles and transitions were both fun and original. \n\nI don't think my review can do the movie justice because the number of golden globe awards it's winning (as I'm writing this), and the review by Chris Hartwell (in The Hart Beat) speaks for itself.\n\nThe reason for the missing star is because the dancing and singing of the two main actors was good but not exactly \"broadway\" level. Their chemistry, however, more than compensated where they lacked in theatrical skills.",

His direction is impeccable, especially in the opening scene. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are excellent in their roles. They have perfect chemistry together. I see Oscar nominations in their future. The film's musical numbers are amazing. This is coming from someone who usually isn't the biggest fan of musicals. The story is very dreamlike, but it manages to still be realistic. The drama is very compelling. Technically, the film is beautifully filmed. There are certain shots that are just excellent. Overall, this film deserves all of the Oscar buzz it is getting. It is original and refreshing. It is one of the best films of the year.",

The mix of music and excellent story telling is put together in a package I could never have imagined to be so marvelous. The camera movement for this movie felt pretty natural and captured the right angles every time. The transition of focus using lighting was almost impeccable. Both Emma and Ryan do an excellent job bringing their character to life (Emma, I feel, does outshine Ryan a bit). Now to the music: As many other people keep complaining about, Emma and Ryan do not have the best voices. BUT WHO CARES. The music is still sounds great, keeps furthering the emotion associated with this film, and helps support the structure of the story. The story was compelling and full of emotion which keeps you intrigued and always wanting more. The movie is a rollercoaster ride of emotions and beauty. Any imperfections or negative aspects are pretty much impossible to notice when put next to the overall greatness of this movie. I have nothing but praise for this film, definitely a must watch.",

La La Land is undoubtedly a love letter to classic Hollywood in its approach and gusto, but not once loses sight of modern sensibilities, aptly morphing the sweet and the sour, the passion and the heartbreak. It's perhaps in its rigorous balance that the film shines, and yet it's never as powerful as when it gives in to chaos, for that's when we are truly immersed in the city of stars. Inspiring and soul crushing in equal measure, this musical showcases two essential truths. One, there is still room in cinema to sell dreams, just like Hollywood used to; two, Chazelle's directorial vision showcases a premature mastery of the craft. The musical numbers are exquisitely executed and blend in the narrative without the often awkward transitions so common in the genre. Not only that but there's a sense of control, a tight grip Chazelle holds over the narrative, jumping from the upbeat celebration of life to the intense reality of broken dreams without missing a beat. In many ways, he brings to the film the passion he sells, which much like jazz is a fierce competition for a grand emotion. And La La Land has it. It has it all.",

I have to say I was uncomfortable from the beginning scenes. This is supposed to be an homage to musicals and Los Angeles itself. The longer I watched the more I saw it as not so original as there were ripoffs of many old musicals. There were pieces of An American in Paris, Singing in the Rain, Funny Face and more. I have nothing bad to say about the acting as I think both stars did the best they could with what they had to work with. They are not singers or dancers but with choreography that was so very boring they really didn't have to try very hard. The movie was beautifully shot with many iconic locations.

            "content": "\"La La Land\" and The Magic Of Unrequited Love \nLove, as most people would agree, is an emotion spurred by fortuity, driven by desire and strengthened by longing. However, there are only two ways the journey of love can end. Either at a crossroads which leads two people down an unknown path together or propels them on different journeys altogether. Blessed are those that find the former for there's a side to love that tugs at your soul if you go down the latter. It doesn't leave you, follows you like an iota of your shadow and often drives you towards the realization of your better self. This last facet is what many a cinematic journeys have tried to explore over years. \"La La Land\" tries to do the same. It however succeeds on levels where others have faltered. \nMia and Sebastian's meetings in the land of dreams, Los Angeles are owed completely to serendipity. They're chasing their dreams; she constantly auditioning for acting roles and he being a pianist, pining to own a jazz club of his own; trapped by both their circumstances or by sheer deficiency of luck, in equal measure. \nHowever when fate intervenes, they get together and set down the path of discovering themselves through the eyes of the other. \nThat the movie is a musical, works tremendously in its favour as the melodious interludes enhance the narrative. The journey that the lead pair undertakes together is buoyed by the music which is the essence of their relationship. The accompanying visuals elevate the proceedings to a surreal level. Damien Chazelle, the director who broke out in a big way with his stupendous feature \"Whiplash\", dedicated the movie to old-school Hollywood fare and the relationship of Mia and Sebastian is steeped in old-world charm reminiscent of yore. The twist, in the modern setting of the story, works wonderfully when you accept that whatever is happening could only possibly happen in cinema. There is no conscious effort to project believability. This is where the heart of the movie lies. \nEmma Stone won the prize for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival, where the film premiered, and this is, by far her best work deserving of all the laurels and accolades. Ryan Gosling gives the understated performance of the year as he respectfully surrenders to the powerhouse that is Stone. The pair that first featured in \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\" has an effortless chemistry that is the driving force of the feature. \nThe movie does not have a perfect ending. It recaps the moments of Mia and Sebastian's lives together through a perfect kaleidoscope of images. It is sad but they have contented smiles for the delineation of their dreams and hopes for each other is fulfilled. It might break your heart, but when you think about it once you have left the cinema, you know through your ache that there could not be a better end to the story. \nRating: 5/5",

            "content": "I understand that the year 2016 has been, charitably put, unkind to many people and why we all could use a little escapism around this time of year. Writer/director Damien Chazelle made a big Oscar splash with 2014's Whiplash to make his passion project, a sincere musical that recreates the style of classic Hollywood. La La Land is a stylistic throwback that has enchanted critics and seems destined to compete for some of the biggest awards this season. Just imagine how much better it would be if it was great.\n\nChazelle and company certainly knows how to make an impression. The opening number transforms an L.A. traffic jam into a full-blown song-and-dance explosion, with commuters exiting their cars and coalescing into a teaming mass of jubilation on the freeway. It's a moment that is sincere and full of energy and promise. The brightly colored commuters come together in long unbroken with a widescreen camera that dives and dips and leaves plenty of space for the audience to appreciate the dancing. This is a movie that wants you to see all of the rainbow-colored performers while they strut their stuff. It's here that we're introduced to Mia (Emma Stone), a part-time barista and struggling wannabe actress, and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), a jazz musician who dreams of opening his own club at a historical site. These two dreamers resist each other but of course destiny has another plan. A highlight is a flirty sequence set atop a Hollywood Hillside overlooking the purplish dawn. Mia and Sebastian sing how beautiful this scenic view would be if only they were with someone they loved, playfully antagonizing the other into a dancer's rivalry. The dancing is mischievous and fun and performed in wide angles to soak in the movements. It's easy to get caught up in Chazelle's early swell, a transporting experience that extols the virtues of classical musicals by the likes of Vincent Minnelli, Gene Kelly, and especially Jacques Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. Chazelle fills out his frame like a painter. There's an infectious love for Old Hollywood that tries to alchemize its influences into something new and old, and for a good while Chazelle is able to maintain this fizzy, effervescent experience and remind you of the soothing joys of a good movie musical told with finesse and brio.\n\nThen after about forty-five minutes the fizz gets a little staler and that's when I felt the gnawing emptiness underneath all the Old Hollywood homage. It reminded me of 2011's Best Picture winner, The Artist, as a movie that is more affectionate imitation than genuine substance. As I wrote in my review for The Artist: \"The entire affair has such a slight feel to it; the movie is a confection, a sweet treat that melts away instantly after viewing. If you strip away all the old Hollywood nostalgia, there is very little substance here.\" It's all mimicry of the highest order but Chazelle hasn't put enough authentic feeling into his imitation. There's a fealty to the sources of his inspiration that Chazelle is replicating, and his screen pops with coded visual reminders (look, it's Gosling leaning off a street lamp), but it fetishizes the inspirations rather than building from them. Quentin Tarantino is transparent about his outr\u00e9 influences but he doesn't forget to tell an engaging story too. It's in the movie's dispiriting second half that it becomes all too clear just how little substance there is to our lovers as well as the industry satire. This is miles away from Singin' in the Rain, folks (my favorite film musical, for the record) and more the same old broadsides about the industry: they're shallow, they're inconsiderate, they swallow up the dreamers, they \"celebrate everything and value nothing,\" as Sebastian put it. It's not like the movie is telling you anything you haven't heard before, and that's fine but it limits any impact. It also seems to exist in a universe where minorities are mere background players to prop up the dazzling lives of the beautiful white leads. Imagine the enjoyment if some of that snappy industry satire was reserved for its less progressive casting practices. Can you imagine this kind of movie starring Tessa Thompson (Creed)?\n\nAffection can only go so far because eventually the gravity of your characters, their relationship, their goals and dreams and relatability will need to kick in, and it doesn't. I think this is because the first forty-five minutes are the typical rom-com story of the boy getting the girl. It's the portion where the movie weaves its old Hollywood spell and courts us too, and it's fun. And like bad relationships, once it has you La La Land feels like it has to do less work. Chazelle has to manufacture a series of pity problems (more below) to push his lovers apart and question whether these two star-crossed kids might make it after all. If the beginning half is the swirling romance that reverently celebrates old Hollywood, the second half is the attempt to \"ground\" the film in a sense of realism. It feels too late tonally to switch gears and it undercuts the first half. It might sound contradictory but if La La Land was just going to be a trifle then I wish it went all-in rather than half-heartedly trying an \"edge\" of harsh reality to mix the sour with the sweet. Just because the movie sets up the dreams of its characters, puts them together, and says not so fast doesn't mean that Chazelle has properly set up this nascent melancholy.\n\nMia and Sebastian are not particularly strong characters. The unified star power of the lead actors is enough to disguise this fact for a majority of the movie and maybe for some the entirety. They don't have anything of import to say beyond their dreams and their jobs that are presently in the way of achieving said dreams. I couldn't tell you anything else about these characters. For Mia and Sebastian, the world is divided into those who are pure and those who are impure, and the dichotomy will rankle anyone who has interacted with more than their share of hipster. Sebastian is a music snob who wants to impress upon the world the importance of jazz even as it shrugs indifferently. Nobody gets it, man. He'll fight the good fight no matter what because Sebastian's fight is Chazelle's: taking outdated material and importing value to a new generation. The characters serve the plot and exist to entwine and then be dutifully pulled apart. It's hard to invest in the characters when they won't show who they are and why they should be together. Maybe that's the point ultimately, a rich meta commentary on how attenuated the central courtships in movies themselves are, or the fleeting relationship between film and audience, or maybe I'm just hoofing as hard as the leads to insert more meaning here.\n\nThe second half paddles into what my friend Ben Bailey affectionately termed White People Problems: The Musical. I won't fully concur but the conflicts are too forced and the characters become whiney. Sebastian rejoins a pop band where he doesn't feel 100 percent creatively fulfilled because he isn't performing \"true jazz.\" The band is also popular and this causes friction because he has \"sold out\" on his dream, as if toiling during for any period of time is giving up. I guess you must be single-minded or it doesn't count. Their combined egos won't allow for different variations of success. La La Land pretends to endorse the dreamers but does it really? The only dreamers who seem to count are Mia and Sebastian. What happened to Mia's lively group of roommates and friends from the beginning party? What about the nebbish screenwriter the movie mocks for an easy laugh? There are no significant supporting characters in this movie; the universe belongs to Mia and Sebastian. They're not as insufferable as the characters from Rent but it's definitely a detriment. Look at the characters in Fame, a group of hungry teenagers who came from all walks of life and circumstances to try and achieve their titular dream of stardom.\n\nThe limitations of its doe-eyed leads present some issues. Stone (Birdman) is smashing in the movie but part of that is because, aside from some song-and-dance choreography, the movie asks very little of her other than to be cute, a trait Stone has in natural abundance. There are two standout scenes for the actress. The first is an audition where pretends to be a mistress getting the \"sorry, I can't do this\" phone call from the man she thought had loved her. The sheer variety of emotions that Stone is so able to quickly convey on her face, in her tremulous eyes, and posture are remarkable. Of course the problem is that she's too objectively good to keep getting blithely rejected by cold-hearted casting agents. The second is a musical showcase where Stone belts out a story about how her aunt inspired her to be a thespian. Stone is effortlessly captivating but she deserves better than to be foil to a grumbly Gosling. I feel that Gosling is one of those actors who can be amazingly talented when plugged into the right role and with the right director (see: Half Nelson, The Believer, The Big Short). He has an easygoing charm that all-too easily morphs into smarm without the right guidance or motivation on his part. Sebastian feels like a scowling grump who wants to bludgeon the world with his point of view. It feels more like he's in it for submission. Gosling's performance left me wanting someone else to play his part. They were so strong on screen in Crazy, Stupid, Love but that sizzling chemistry of old is gone here. They feel inert together, amplified by Gosling's antiseptic performance. They're both rather limited singers, very thin of voice, and that does hurt a musical. The songs by composer Justin Hurwitz and lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul are exceptionally milquetoast. They're all slight renditions on the same blandly pleasant tune. They evaporated from my memory by the time the end credits started rolling. Moana has nothing to fear come Oscar time from these at-best competent compositions.\n\nIf imitation is the highest form of flattery, then Chazelle's anodyne musical is brimming with appreciation and adoration for the world of classic Hollywood, and that alone will be effectively transporting for many film critics and select audiences bred on a diet of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. La La Land is an airy confection but one that dissipates all too easily after viewing thanks to the limited characters, the limited singing, the limited dancing, the limited songs, and the lack of overall substance independent from imitation. It has its lovely moments and Stone is an ing\u00e9nue worth loving, though not as much her slim character, a dreamer who dreams the dreams of a dreamer. The breezy and bubbly first half doesn't really mesh with the second half. I think it's telling that Mia and Sebastian's \"love theme\" is a sad plaintive piano trinkle. As the characters get more sullen and sour, the fizzy fun fades away and it starts to feel like a New Year's Eve hangover that left you addled and warm but only in a vaguely ephemeral sense. If it leaves you toe tapping and giddy, I'm glad. I'm already mentally prepared for it to practically sweep the Oscars, as they do love celebrating their own importance. La La Land is a movie musical that is stuck looking backward that it loses its own footing.\n\nNate's Grade: B-",

But don't be scared away, the music sets the mood and fits the movie. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have perfect chemistry, both trying to make it in Hollywood. John Legend's music and acting hit the mark.It's set in modern day L.A., look close you might see me on the freeway. \"LA LA LAND\" gets my vote for the BEST PICTURE of the year .You walk out happy with a smile in your stomach...not from the buttered popcorn. There's no blood, guts and gore. There's no car chases, bombs or aliens. Maybe one or two F-Bombs. Other than that, it's just an old-fashion love story with a happy ending. How refreshing!

            "content": "I went to go see an advanced screening with my fianc\u00e9 and were amazed by the first musical number. It was well paced, creative and the edits were masked fairly well to create a feeling of a one-shot take.\n\n\nThat feeling of wonder and amazement died out around 10 minutes later.\n\n\nThe film focuses on two characters, Mia, an up-and-coming actress, and Sebastian, a pianist whom I only found out his name when the credits rolled. The bulk of this \"musical\" is dedicated to bland, generic mumblecore-esc small talk between the two characters. After about 30 minutes, you want to scream \"WE GET IT, THEY'RE IN LOVE! GIVE US SOMETHING ELSE!\" Because the central conflict, rather the only conflict in this drudge of a film, comes what felt like the hour mark.\n\n\nHowever good actors Stone and Gosling might be, this movie is all about them. In fact, the movie says \"why care about other people\" and pushes nearly every other character aside, instead of having them boost up the main characters and make them three-dimensional characters.\n\n\n\"Wow, Male Protagonist's sister seems really interesting and has a great personality that compliments him.\" Shouldn't be followed by \"I sure hope she shows up again...\" because after a few scenes, if that, you will never see them again. Mia's roommates? 3 scenes I think. Ryan's sister? Again, one scene. Mia's boss? Three scenes. You might as well not even have them in this film. If this was a short film, it would've made sense, but this movie is 2 hours and 8 minutes.\n\n\nOk, there's this one scene where the two protagonists are talking about Jazz, and Ryan talks about how Jazz is about conflict and how it's dying (which is crap, by the way) and the first thing I thought was \"Oh good, conflict. I would love to see that right about now.\" And that's the main thing. Spoilers, the conflict is he works too much so hey break up, but he believes in her so they reconcile. La-de-freakin-da. \n\n\nHe wants to open a Jazz club, but can't hold a job, she wants to be an actress but no one will hire her. Those are character motivations, but the film does nothing with them.\n\n\nThen she gets mad at him for getting a stable job in a band, but it's bad because he has to travel all the time and doesn't really enjoy it. It's called a job. It's how you pay rent. It's how you can put money aside for your dream of owning a club, because no one is just going to give it to you.\n\n\nHeck, she finds this out in the next freaking scene but shrugs it off like nothing. What a hypocrite, and this is who the movie wants us to root for.\n\n\nEven the big \"climax\" for Mia falls flat. She finally gets her chance to be taken seriously for an audition and her telling a story turns into a song and all I could think is \"Dancer in the Dark did this better\" because when they used it, there was no backing music, it was from Selma's heart and gut. It was raw. The same setup for this scene was boring at best and migraine-inducing at worst.\n\n\nI feel like the saddest thing is that this could've been an interesting story. Mia doesn't like Jazz, but that's the love of Ryan's life. Don't give her a musical number until the end and make the movie about her own perspective that music should be more like, I don't know, pop or something. Use the story as a device to grow the character and the theme of music to mirror the character's growth. When she finally comes around to understanding Ryan and Jazz, that's when she nails the audition, etc, etc.\n\n\nThere are so many plot holes as well. Why does she keep tap shoes in her purse instead of sneakers, which would be more comfortable for walking (for that matter, why does she keep the same kind of tap shoes Ryan Gosling wears). You could shrug it off as \"it's a dream/fantasy sequence\" but, no. She gets in the car with them. She drives home with them. What part of a fantasy is having a guy hand you the shoes you changed out of as you leave? Also, if this is set in modern day, why wouldn't they have exchanged numbers when they made plans? Things come up and sometimes plans change. A simple \"I forgot about this dinner with my bf and his brother\" solves the situation. Later on, they do use cellphones, depending on your interpretation of how to use a phone.\n\n\nI could go on and rant about the weird, inconsistently dilated pupils, some of the effect shots had errors, such as poor rotoscoping, unsynched lip sync, and so on. It's just baffling that this film wasn't straight-to-VHS, because it feels like a rushed film made for a quick cash-grab.\n\n\nAt the end of this film, there is a fantasy sequence of how everything should've gone, and as aesthetically pleasing as it is, it's a slap in the face. That's what you wanted the film to be, and now you're basically just rewatching the entire film again in a better-paced fashion.\n\n\nAnd I get it, film should surprise you and try to be non-conventional and experimental, but this film is just way too bland to accomplish it.\n\n\nThe best way I can describe my frustration is he final two shot of the film. In this shot, Emma Stone shoes more emotion then the entirety of the film combined. There is so much said in one look that the previous 2 hours, 7 minutes couldn't say with words. Maybe that was the point? Even if it was, you just wasted 2 hours getting to it. Good job, you're amazing, go pat yourself on the back.\n\n\nIt's really hard to put an entire film on two actor's shoulders to carry for the entire movie. Even some of my favorite actors have fallen under similar weight, but, at the end of the day, even in those films, there is a method to the madness. There is meaning, you grow as a person through the trials you face. You overcome diversity and obstacles to become a better person and that's why we love movies. That's why musicals are great, they almost satirize that by pushing everything to their extremes until those emotions, those feelings are almost a parody, but, because of the suspension of disbelief, we accept them. They aren't documentaries, they're dramatizations and a bad musical doesn't understand any of that.\n\n\nYou look at something like All That Jazz (1978) where the thesis is that musical numbers should come during some logical extreme or fit the situation. That film actively points out that a musical number for the sake of having one is boring (during the Gideon and Jagger dance number, just look at Joe's reaction to it). Whether you believe in that or not, every motion in the choreography had a purpose. The worst thing in a musical number is for your viewer to go \"and they're going to spin now. Called it.\" It's hackney, contrived, and dull.\n\n\nI wanted to call this film \"fun and mindless\" I really did, but it's more like torture to get through than a good date movie. Save yourself some time and fast forward after the first three musical numbers until the end.",

In the film you are guided through a modern LA following a struggling pianist Sebastian and an endlessly dedicated actress Mia, and their journey to find success in their respective dream careers. Full of constantly swinging emotions you will experience moments of happiness, sadness, and pure excitement that will take you on a rollercoaster with plenty of surprises. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are electrifying in every scene they feature and have chemistry bleeding off the screen that will have you loving both of their characters. Damien Chazelle directs this film and if you don't know who he his then you most definitely will know. He previously directed Whiplash (2015), one of the best movies of that year and shares many of the same qualities that makes this film so majestic. \n\nThe way you are introduced to these two main characters (Sebastian and Mia) and the way you gradually learn more and more about them is handled in such an amazing manner that you quickly fall in love with them and feel as though you know both of them. Watching them interact throughout the film and go back and forth whether it was through musical numbers or just one on one dialogue scenes was so engaging and entertaining because you really care for both of them and they just have a chemistry together that you cannot look away from. The performances by Gosling and Stone are most definitely two of the best you will see this year, but Emma Stone in particular puts on a show so compelling and so emotionally powerful that if anyone manages to take the Academy Award for Best Actress from her come February i will be more than shocked. The dedication and emotion they convey through their performances adds so much to the film and compliments every other department very well. There is also a good amount of humour injected in small doses constantly throughout the film and that helped to lighten the tone when transitioning from moments that may not be so upbeat. \n\nAs i mentioned previously, Damien Chazelle is the mastermind behind La La Land and his huge passion for music is represented vividly. The way he implements it into the film is executed with near perfection in every scene. It features as a technique used to establish a sense of tone, to evoke certain emotions and emotional transitions, and even extremely cleverly as a storytelling technique where many scenes rely on the music and visuals alone to tell the story. There are even moments where the overall tone of the film manages to shift multiple times through a single song so elegantly it was just beautiful. One cannot talk about this film without highlighting the downright flawless cinematography that only elevates your enjoyment of the film. Every shot is so intricately detailed and planned out that half the time i found myself getting lost in the stunning scenery that continued to wow me right to the very end. And it isn't just the complexity of scenes that draws your gaze, simple shots such as one involving black silhouettes gliding over a starry night sky backdrop were unbelievably beautiful. This movie i would say is worth seeing simply to admire the cinematography work and visual style on show. \n\nThere isn't a single negative i have been able to pick out where i thought the film needed some fixing. The pacing ebbs and flows with the tones and emotions playing out in the film which is just an amazing way to emulate how certain characters are feeling at various points of the film. Genius filmmaking. I will say though that yes there is romance, there is drama, and there is humour here for you to enjoy, but this is first an foremost a Musical at its core. If you don't like musicals you will be painfully and eagerly awaiting the credits, but if you are a fan of the musical genre then holy shit, you cannot miss this film once it comes to theatres. \n\n9.7/10",

            "content": "\"That's LA, they worship everything and value nothing.\"\n\nAs a millennial in love with the past, there is a certain relatable feel to the way Ryan Gosling's character, Sebastian, describes LA's ever evolving sense of self. The city's need to move forward to newer, brighter, bigger, pictures often folds its own history into a suitcase and kicks it underneath a bed of memories, not to be seen ever again. Once in a while a weary soul, searching for something truly special, unearths these dusty and gray memories; they shine them up like new and rediscover the rich golden history of film, long thought gone. Director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) brings the genre of the Hollywood musical back to roaring life with the colorful, bittersweet romance of La La Land. \n\nThe story opens on a crowded highway in standstill traffic during a sunny, winter day in LA. As the honking of cars and blaring of radio tunes begins to silence, a song blossoms up as the music begins to kick in; an overture commences with a big musical number (actually filmed on a busy LA highway), setting the tone for the rest of the film. From here, we meet two young aspiring artist, Mia and Sebastian, destined to meet each other in short time. Mia is a struggling actress dreaming of making it big in Hollywood, giving her talents an audience yet constantly getting rejected and interrupted during auditions. Sebastian is a jazz musician living a past forgotten by many and yearns to open up his own jazz bar, bringing back the music he so desperately loves. The two meet during chance encounters and fall in love, pushing each other to achieve their own dreams. Along the way, those same dreams threaten to tear them apart as reality slowly creeps in causing Mia and Sebastian to rethink their dreams and their relationship.\n\nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling play the roles of Mia and Sebastian, respectively, cementing their unmatched chemistry on film. Their character's love and devotion to each others passion drives them and the story to unprecedented heights; you could even say the film works solely off their magnetic connection and ability to relate to audiences. John Legend makes an appearance as an old colleague of Sebastian named Keith, beckoning Sebastian to move forward with his music and leave the jazz world of decades past behind him. J.K. Simmons also has a small, funny cameo, channeling his best Terence Fletcher from Chazelle's 2014 hit, Whiplash. Chazelle works his magic off camera as director and writer, giving us a beautiful and melancholy story, surrounded by clear LA skies, technicolor hues, and a brimming optimism sorely missing from movies nowadays. The songs and score are composed and orchestrated by Justin Hurwitz, infusing jazz melodies that give weight to the film, an old soul wrapped in covers of the present day. The six original songs excite, uplift, and catch audiences attention with vibrancy and a dash of bittersweet sadness, adding a light touch with emotional depth as the story unfolds.\n\nIn capable hands with talented artist, La La Land makes viewers fall in love with musicals and reinvigorates a faded genre of Hollywood with a story about the pursuit of one's dreams and the chances we take to make them come true. Chazelle creates musical movie magic at its purest, most enchanting, and most heartbreaking, making hearts dance and swell with joy all the way through. The film may not be for everyone, admittedly, but it comes with a moving message for the dreamer in all of us, telling us to purse our dreams and take chances in life, which could open the door for something wonderful. Music and film unite to mimic our truest moments in life, which are often accompanied by a tune spinning in our heads. Whether it's dancing on top of cars, diving into pools in three piece suits, or dancing away in a sea of stars, the power of music and machine bring life to a piece Hollywood magic the industry has been missing. Made with love, precision, and brilliant composition, Chazelle's La La Land is easily one of the best, if not the best, film of 2016.",

            "content": "Bravo director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash [2014]) another fantastic film. A musical, drama and comedy La La Land is simply amazing. Borrowing and paying homage to films from the 40's and 50's, but set during the present day we follow two dreamers Mia (Emma Stone) a struggling actress that works as a barista on the WB Lot and Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a jazz musician that is scared of change, but has big plans for himself one day. The two have a few chance meetings and eventually fall in love. Eventually, Sebastian takes a job in a band which gives him a steady job, but drives him further away from his dream and also Mia. They both have to realize what they really want eventually. The cinematography is fantastic, the songs are fantastic, the chemistry between Gosling and Stone is great (there's a reason this is the third time they've starred in a movie together). Gosling is literally trapped in the past...driving an old car, dressing like a lost actor from the 50's and its Mia that opens his eyes and he vice versa to unlocking her own abilities and believing in herself. I will say this is probably the best film i've seen all year. As a film buff its got some great scenes and especially the last 15 minutes might be some of the most heartbreaking stuff I've seen in awhile. This a great film and I hope you all give it a look...it's technically a musical, but it works so well and I guarantee if you've ever been in a serious relationship this movie will relate to some level to ya. Get out and see it!",

Damien knows how to hook the audience in with a unpredictable hook. Just when we think the movie is over is is not. The audience is thinking to themselves it really is not over? Many of today's movies do not have the wow factor, or the element of unpredictable. This one does. The whole cast and crew do a great job of capturing the golden years of Hollywood in a very 21st century style of storytelling. More then anything the movie tells political correctness to get lost. Damien shows the audience it is okay for a man to be man and woman to be a woman. Men are suppose to lead and be the provider and protector for the woman. Women want to know how their man can make them feel safe and protected. All of the musical numbers are just amazing. My favorite song from the movie is Dreamers. Emma Stone does a great job of really capturing the essence of this song. Just like Vegas, LA is a city that will eat one up. It is full of promise and at the same time many hardships for those who call it home. The entertainment industry is a very tough and competitive business. Just because one has talent does mean they will automatically make it in Tinseltown. It take sacrifice and work to have our dreams come true. In the end all of us want to find love and live a a successful and wonderful life. We have love, money, and the Lord in our own lives. This movie is a five out five stars. It really is that good.",

This movie, as indicated by many, is a tribute to classic movie musicals. Key word: TRIBUTE. It's not as perfectly sung and danced as the classics because it's not trying to be the classics, but it still has a lot of heart about it that is reminiscent of them. It has a slightly imperfect edge that makes the characters seem more accessible.  The musical numbers are integrated seamlessly into the story, and the songs themselves are either very joyous or very cerebral. All are great though. Top-notch performances by both Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, and am ending that will make you think for days. I think this is as close to perfect as you can get in a movie, and a perfect homage to classic movie musicals while still feeling fresh and modern. Well done, Damien Chazelle.",

I think this is interesting how this film starts off with a musical number that does not have either of the main character in the opening. Kind of reminds me Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom opening song or the old films that have musical numbers. I think this film is interesting how this film takes it from Emma Stones perspective at the beginning of the film after the opening then 17 minutes in flips to see Ryan Gosling's character's perspective. I thought was unexpected twist. I like the way the camera pans and zooms in or uses reflections in this film. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in my opinion were not the best singers for the job. I think that this film could have been better done with better singing and musically talented people rather than going for better known actors. However I think that their weakness showed to help tell the story since they were both struggling. I will say that this film had a lot of positives when it came to aspects to things such as choreography, lighting, sets, writing, writing the songs. I think it is interesting how J.K. Simmons is in this film for such a brief moment in this film. I liked the diversity in this film as far as mixing styles and showing modern with past styles in music and looks of old with new. I like the mix of Jazz, hip hop, classical, 1930's-1950's, like music, 1980's song like Take on Me, old fashion musical numbers, with other styles. I think what stands out too is how silence is used in this film after using music to bring these dramatic moments. I also think is interesting is when sound effects drive a scene like a fire alarm or car horns. I was not a fan of the photo shoot scene. I think that it could have been better done. I think the biting of the lip looks dumb. I like the ending showing the possible result that could have happened",

            "content": "The joyful musical genre has been in the Hollywood cemetery for too long now, but even rarer now is a musical with entirely original music in an entirely original story, which director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash) achieves with expert choreography. While he may give Southern California a bit too overly glamorous of a view with no dark edge, he still recaptures the same zest of West Side Story while cranking the spectacle up a notch. It's always a challenge for any serious director to stage a film where everyone breaks out into song without it oozing Disney Channel cheese, but Damien Chazelle has done it!\n\nWithin Chazelle's cinematic recreation of Southern California, he fastens our seatbelts through the bumpy relationship between two artists over the course of four long seasons, starting at the heat of Christmas. One is a ruby-red aspiring actress who cannot land an audition, and thus must serve coffee under a careless manager to make ends meet. The other is a Fred Astaire-Dooley Wilson mash-up whose fast fingers command jazz on the piano, no matter what his boss wants him to play. After they first meet over road rage at rush hour, these distracted minds find that destiny has forced them together with coincidental run-ins day after day. Everything after that is as pure and classic as dancing under a full moon.\n\nOnce we learn about what these two have in common, boy is it the beginning of a beautiful friendship! He wants to revive Jazz as a modern art form, but she cannot stand listening to it, and this subject alone stems all the other conflicts that these two share over the course of a year. It is a pleasure to see the ups and downs of their romance, even if the other people in their lives are treated by the screenwriter as if they don't even matter.\n\nYet it's not the supporting cast who helps us to understand their relationship, but the numbers that project their thoughts onto the moment. On their first formal meeting, she hears his piano playing as lit by a single spotlight, as if she's glancing into his own little world. On second formal meeting, they tap dance in front of a skyline at twilight. On the first date, they are swept off their feet-literally, to a dance against the stars in a planetarium. On the tenth date, they sing an Oscar-worthy duet. As time goes by, the dream of making it to the top of the world in Paris quickly diminishes. Her tears swell up along with the audiences'; I'll even admit I choked up as well, and I'm a man.",

You will most likely be able to sort yourself into either camp from the opening scene. The movie opens in L.A traffic on a hot Californian winters day when someone suddenly feels the joy from the good weather and begins to sing, before long every person from every car is singing along to an undoubtedly catchy bright song. If this doesn't sound like your type of movie its probably best to quit now, if your anything like me then you\u0092ll be completely in for the ride. As the movie progresses the tone does shift to a darker more realistic movie about , the values of dreams and passion but the entire movie does have an dazzling bright, and whimsical feel. This is the type of movie that really shouldn't work but through great direction, performances, music and a tough of Hollywood magic it does. Damien Chazelle does an amazing job directing. its clear he has so much love and passion for not just this movie but the genre in general. It walks the perfect line of call backs to classic Hollywood and a modern musical. Emma Stone shines in this giving a perfect mix of innocence and hopefulness and realism and heartbreak. She is also has an absolutely amazing singing voice. Acting against her is Ryan Gosling. Ryan brings this amazing classic Hollywood charm to role in a both idealized and grounded role. The screenplay is wonderful. It has an amazing mix of humour, heart and story. The most surprising thing about the movie was it\u0092s humour. Especially in the first half of the movie the tone is surprisingly high and funny. The second half gets noticeably darker and more grounded but the transition feels natural. It follows the characters as they start out optimistic and in love but as tome goes on they're forced to face the facts about the cost of following passion. The love story between Mia and Sebastian (Stone and Gosling) is wonderfully sweet yet convincing. They're natural chemistry mixed with great screenplay lead to one of the greatest movie couples in recent cinematic memory. The musical gives the entire movie a whimsical feeling but each song sets an distinct mood for each scene. Gosling and Stone\u0092s voices are able to hit a range of different styled and melodies. The cinematography is beautiful. I gives L.A a very timeless yet still current feeling to it. it had great flow and very few jump cuts which is very impressive during elaborate dance sequences. Over all La La Land is a charming beautiful love story 9/10.",

Immediately clear is that it is among 2016's great films.\n\tThe movie, made all the more charismatic as a result of its inspired casting, stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a pair of struggling Hollywood amateurs brought together by circumstances more cinematically quaint than Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron's first meeting in \"An American in Paris\" (1951).  He, a traditionalist pianist named Sebastian, fantasizes about bringing jazz back to the masses and opening a club Morris Levy'd be proud of.  She, an aspiring actress named Mia, currently works at a coffeeshop on the fringes of a production studio but yearns to be the Ingrid Bergman of the new millennium.  After two abrupt encounters that find Sebastian in the grips of frustration, the twosome eventually finds common ground at a party characterized by the rubbing of elbows of big wigs and upstarts.\t\n\tFor its next two hours does \"La La Land\" follow their romance with a dedication that rings as hopelessly tender, supplely theatrical, and delicately bittersweet.  Like Judy Garland and James Mason's relationship in \"A Star Is Born\" (1954) - though octaves less stormy - the film is unmoving in its conclusion that the hard-to-reach finish line that is professional success isn't much a personal life's wingman.  To struggle together isn't always synonymous with staying together, and yet there's a gorgeous stir in that sentiment that gives \"La La Land\" the weight necessary to corroborate that it's lyrical, not just romantic zing.  Its characters grow together, perfect themselves together - they're so much more than the frequently stock characters of the musical.\n\t\"La La Land\" is, of course, likely to appeal to the old souls that find a strange manner of tranquility when in the presence of Louis B. Mayer's star factory and all its prim products.  Quickly clear to us is that Sebastian and Mia are the sort that have to fight for years to become hot commodities, but only later, in the film's climactic scene (which, in addition to being one of the best movie moments of the decade, finds an auditioning Mia singing of the melancholies that come along with being a hopeless dreamer), are we reminded of all the individuals that lusted after seeing their name in lights but didn't ever find out what it was like to get their big break.\n\tAnd that fantasist cum fatalist attitude is what gets Chazelle far.  Though he's devout in his homages to the musical's most triumphant eras (with the opening credits preceded by the CinemaScope logo, with the photography reminiscent of the warmth of 1961's \"West Side Story,\" and with the final few moments throwing in glimpses of dreamworlds of 1953's \"The Band Wagon's\" quality), never does he lose sight of the woes that plague an idealist in a world that doesn't much care if you make it or if you don't.  When not ensnared with the technical mastery of its musical sequences - the flamboyant \"Someone's In the Crowd\" is the 2016 equivalent of \"Singin' in the Rain's\" iconic \"Good Morning\" routine, and the gravity toying, star bound slow dance (set in the all-important planetarium of 1955's \"Rebel Without a Cause\") is an unforgettable sight - ample time is committed to digging claws into the characters' neuroses.  \n\tThe succession of audition scenes on the part of Stone is enough to argue for the conviction that she's among the best actresses of her generation, but better yet are the sequences that challenge the latter and Gosling's easygoing rapport.  It's reliably endearing to watch them make small talk, but \"La La Land\" is at its most magnificent when they're at odds with what they want professionally and what they want personally, the world working against them as their respective dreams clash with the dreams of the other.  \n\tStone is Oscar worthy as a woman at war with the painful cravings to become America's next sweetheart and the increasing plummets in self-confidence due to her seemingly incessant journey of bad auditions.  Gosling is her perfect match - the Astaire to her Rogers - as the musical zealot that'd rather die with his ambitions deep in his belly than give up on them.  Together do they blend seamlessly, bringing a type of cinematic romance that goes far beyond working off chemistry that works for a screen test.  Here, they develop a relationship of three-dimensional impact, so much so that even when their courtship is faced with potential ruin do we still find ourselves rooting for their success as a pair.\n\tThey're the kind of persona driven stars we need in our disenchanted times, and Chazelle, hot off 2014's fast and furious \"Whiplash,\" is a talent in full command of his artistic breadth.  He's an auteur able to connect his heart to the lens with the clarity of a young Scorsese, turning relative inexperience to youthful acuity that reeks of frenetic energy and a remarkably personal style.  \"La La Land's\" superlative conjoining of the old and the new, complemented by the joys of fantastical musical tropes, establishes it as a modern classic.  That a modern classic can take on the form of the cinema's most dated genre is the biggest indicator of the way its zeal overtakes you.",

            "content": "In real life, most people don't randomly break out in song and dance, but the escapism of the big screen has been bringing Movie Fans musical feature films since the very first days of the sound motion picture. Only the second film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture was a musical (1929's \"The Broadway Melody\"). Oversaturation in the marketplace and changing audience tastes led to the production of fewer musicals, but they never went away. Some of the best-loved musicals in film history (e.g. \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" and \"Singin' in the Rain\") came out in the 10-year span 1944-1953. But the ensuing decades each produced very popular musicals: \"West Side Story\", \"The Sound of Music\" and \"Oliver!\" (all Best Picture Oscar winners from the 1960s), \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\", \"Grease\" and \"All That Jazz\" (1970s), \"Victor/Victoria\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\" and \"The Little Mermaid\" (1980s), \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"The Lion King\" and \"Evita\" (1990s) and, in the early 2000s, \"Moulin Rouge!\", \"Frozen\", \"Dreamgirls\" and \"Chicago\", which became the first musical in 34 years to win Best Picture.\n\n2016's \"La La Land\" (PG-13, 2:08) is the purest original (non-adapted) live action musical in many years, and has both the pedigree and the quality to duplicate the accomplishment of 2002's \"Chicago\". \"La La Land\" was written and directed by Damien Chazelle, who was the writer-director of 2014's \"Whiplash\", which earned him Oscar nods for his script and his film. This one is filled with original songs which are composed and orchestrated by Chazelle's previous collaborator, Justin Hurwitz, with lyrics by the award-winning musical theater team known as Pasek and Paul. Musician John Legend has a major role in the film and its stars, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, are both past Oscar nominees who earlier appeared together in two other movies - 2011's \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\" and 2013's \"Gangster Squad\". And, yes, they both sing and dance while telling this particular musical's story of romance, dreams and hope. It takes place in the present but feels like a throwback - like the most entertaining musicals of yesteryear. \n\nThe film's title has a dual meaning: (1) referring to people who live their lives in a seemingly unrealistic dream world and (2) the city of Los Angeles itself, where most of the action takes place. In fact, the film opens with a song-and-dance number with commuters stuck on a typically grid-locked L.A. highway. At the very end of that scene, aspiring actress Mia Dolan (Stone) has a random, brief and unpleasant encounter with struggling jazz keyboardist, Sebastian Wilder (Gosling), who acts like a real... pianist. The two run into each other again in Sebastian's jazz club, immediately after he's fired by the club owner (J.K. Simmons) for insisting on playing his own music. Sebastian is no more polite this time. The two finally \"meet cute\" and before long, Mia has left her roommates behind and moved in with Sebastian.\n\nNeither life nor love go smoothly for this pair of stubborn dreamers, but they sure do try hard at both. Mia continues working as a barista on the Warner Bros. studio lot and going to frustrating audition after frustrating audition. Eventually, she decides that her best way forward is to write, finance and produce a one-woman show which, fittingly, focuses on her experiences of leaving her hometown in Nevada and moving to La La Land to pursue her dreams. After dropping the humorously humiliating job where Mia sees him at their third encounter, Sebastian continues to hold fast to his dream of opening his own jazz club, but doesn't really do much about it. He reluctantly takes a job on keys in a music group run by an old acquaintance (Legend), but doesn't enjoy it because they don't play his style of pure jazz. Sebastian's unhappiness turns to resentment and ends up being directed toward Mia, just as her show is about to open. The eventual resolution of their love story and their individual pursuit of their dreams feels right for a movie which celebrates dreamers, but shows what happens when life doesn't go as we've planned.\n\n\"La La Land\" is a wonderful movie, but not, as some reviewers would lead you to believe, flawless. After three contentious encounters, the two main characters just suddenly fall in love, a development that isn't very well earned by the script or the acting. Otherwise, the performances are excellent (especially Stone's) and the script is funny, poignant and grounded... except for that whole thing about characters suddenly breaking into song. But when they do, those songs are both fun and touching. The dancing, however, seems to lack some of the energy and joy that you find in the older Hollywood musicals that inspired this film. Having said all that, I have to put these relatively minor criticisms into perspective: This is a very entertaining and affecting movie. You'll likely be emotionally invested in these characters, smile a lot - and leave the theater wanting the soundtrack. For someone who wants more variety and positivity in today's films, this one is a gift. \"A-\"",

Glowing reviews since the film's debut at the festival circuit only elevated expectations even more and so it is with some trepitation that I venture into this film. However from the moment the film opens with a tone-setting retro chic musical number set on a traffic jammed LA highway that will melt the hardest of hearts and bring a smile to the grumpiest of faces, I know that I have been worrying needlessly. La La Land is a faithful, uncynical, assured and effective take on the musical genre. Keeping the story simple  - boy (a Jazz pianist with big dreams) meets girl (an aspiring actress), fall in love, obstacles arise - set to some of the catchiest tunes you'll hear this or any year, the only word that comes to mind is: Magical. Chazelle's direction is slick and effortless; the pacing is perfect. Shooting it as if we still live in the Golden age of Hollywood in the 50s, the only thing that betrays this timelessness is the existence of mobile phones, the musical numbers are staged with meticulous precision and beautifully composed takes (no MTV style cuts here) that allow the actors to shine and shine they do. I could criticize Stone & Gosling's first duet sounds a little shaky but by the time City of Lights and Audition, two songs for which we might as well give them the Oscars for Best Song now; they are just heartbreakingly good. With two solid gold performances from the leads and impressive visuals that's a feast for the eyes, had the film followed it with a traditionally crowd pleasing ending, this would easily be a 4 star movie. But just when I settle in for this inevitability, he pulls out one final inspired move, with a melancholic and bittersweet ending that provides suprising depth and insight, gaining at least an extra 1/2 star and leaving me breathless and grinning like a lovesick fool as I skip out of the cinema. Following in the steps of An American in Paris, Singing in the Rain and The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, this has 'Classic' written all over it and proves that you can still make movies like they used to. All you need is talent, conviction and whole lot of passion.",

Just last year, we saw the long-awaited return of Star Wars, and no matter what you thought of that movie (I loved it), it was a notable event in history. I didn't think expectations could exceed that, but after Damien Chazelle's incredible breakout Whiplash (my pick for movie of the decade so far), and a ton of critical acclaim for this follow-up, my expectations reached an all-time high.\nI had no doubt this movie would be great, and I suspected it would be the year's best, or at least my favorite. My suspicions were proven true.\n\nDespite a near-perfect opening, I personally wasn't completely into it until maybe 10 minutes in. I feel like this is a normal adjusting period for musicals. After that, as I said earlier, damn.\n\nI'm worried I'll overuse positive adjectives to describe the music, performances, cinematography, etc. I'll just say they were all so exemplary it seems a disservice not to discuss each aspect on end, but I will resist that urge.\n\nTo be fair, the plot to this movie is simple, largely old-fashioned, and if one were to try to describe it negatively, unoriginal. But it's executed so flawlessly (or near it) that I have no complaints. Plus it's an homage to classic musicals, so there's that. There are themes and even some small scenes that reminded me of Whiplash, but again, it worked. And John Legend's parts were just fine, but not as exemplary as the rest of the movie. That's only if I have to find a problem. I honestly love this movie so much, I have to stop writing this now or I may just ramble on forever. It's legitimately one of the greatest theater experiences of my life. Please don't miss out on this.\n\nLa La Land: 9.8/10",

            "content": "The new picture by the creator of \"Whiplash\" consists of few different films. You can find a bodacious musical in a spirit of Hollywood's Golden Age as well as an intimate story about love of two dreamers. An anthem in honour of the titular city and an ironic portrayal of the show business. A fairy tale about pursuing one's dreams and a bitter-sweet story about accepting what is irreversible. Suspended between tradition and modernity, pageantry of classic spectacles and independent cinema's intimacy, \"La La Land\" seems to be Oscar gold.\n\nDamien Chazelle opens the film with a cannon fire. It is a perfect describtion of the virtuoso traffic sequence on a highway, directed in one shot, featuring hundreds of extras. A young woman unexpectedly intones a song about \"another day of sun\" and in that moment the crowd, absorbed in drivers' malaise, sings and dances like the cast of \"Singin' in  the Rain\". Only main characters, Mia and Sebastian, are not in the mood for fun. She works in a coffe shop and ineffectively auditions for roles. He is an unemployed pianist, dreaming of his own jazz club. Although their first meeting does not herald the love till death do them part, the romance sems inevitable. Leading actors are Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, who have had chances to fall head over heels in love with each other in \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\" and \"Gangster Squad\". However, in those two films love theme is a subplot. In \"La La Land\" it' is its heart. \n\nSebastian walks in Mia's life in the right moment. The girl begins to accept the thought of being one of many, trying to impress bored casting directors. Jazzman inspires her and so she takes heart from his words. At the same time, he starts to be in two minds, whether his musical doctrine and arbitrary judgements are signs of immaturity. Their happy end at the horizon may only be a mirage. Chazelle wonders, if a couple of \nsuccess-seeking artists has a chance to build a harmonous relationship. Can the feeling triumph over ambition and ego? Is everything a guise, play or a fantasy in the city called Dream Factory? Many filmmakers have searched for the answers, i.a. Bob Fosse in \"All That Jazz\" and Martin Scorsese in \"New York, New York\". Though, \"La La Land\" is not as drastic - mockery is softened by melancholy and pesymistic conclusions hidden under subtle humour. Ultimately, Chazelle's film is a love letter rather than a reproach on Hollywood.\n\nAs for visual wonders, \"La La Land\" is a masterpiece. All camera pirouettes, rich colours, polished choreography and elegant costumes amaze. Musicals connoisseurs can easily notice inspiration by american canon (\"A Star is Born\", \"Funny Face\") and also european (\"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\"). However, Chazelle is not the epigone, idly focused on the past. He changes the genre conventions in inteligent way: regurally combines classic musical's traits with modern film trends. A great overview of director's artistic strategy is the scene shot in the style of the 50s, where the romantic t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between characters is broken by the cellphone ring.\n\nAt one occasion, Sebastian's friend expresses that jazz is losing the listeners, because of traditionalists who are reluctant to adjusting their music to realities of the 21st century. Those words refer to musicals which, apart from occasional reanimations, seem to be gone. The \n31-year-old director has ambition to reform the genre as well as become its legend. It is hard not to root for him. Chazelle has directed only three films, the second is considered a classic and the third is about to be one. If his talent continues to develop at such pace, it's horrific to imagine what his next picture will be, when he stands behind the camera.",

            "content": "In today's day and age, musicals have surely become a thing of the past. From Rock of Ages to Mamma Mia, this genre has been on the decline for years. Back in the days of Sound of Music or even Grease, people were flocking to the cinemas to see the latest foot-tappers. With the exception of a few recent films like Les Miserables (which wasn't globally loved) or the Oscar-winning Chicago, musicals just haven't had the flare like they used to, until La La Land was unleashed for the world to see this year. I will not be surprised if this film sweeps every awards show it is nominated at, because it truly is a must-see. La La Land is without a doubt, one of the best films you will see this year and here are a few reasons why that is.\n\nI am not a massive fan of this genre, but I won't ignore the greats. Singin' in the Rain is one of my favourite films of all time and this is right up there in terms of quality musicals. Look, this is a story you have seen a million times, but not exactly told quite this way. As a barista/struggling actress (Emma Stone) works to accomplish her dream, she continuously bumps into a struggling pianist (Ryan Gosling) from time to time, making it seem like fate. Exploring their feelings for each other and learning to love each others passions, this is a beautifully crafted picture that is both a love letter to Hollywood and an exploitation of it. Time progresses rapidly throughout this film and the time in between each transition seems flawless, as do the musical numbers that explain each scene in depth. This film is a true marvel and what filmmakers should always strive to achieve.  \n\nWhiplash was one of the greatest films of 2014, due to its passion and simplicity into the life of a passionate drummer. Director Damien Chazelle knows exactly how to put music on screen. He clearly has found a niche in the type of films he will be exploring in the future and I am completely on board. Whether a drummer is being showcased on screen, a pianist playing their heart out, or a big musical number is being performed, there is something special about the way that Chazelle directs his films. The music in his films may be displayed perfectly, but nothing about this film is more perfectly executed than the style (cinematography to be exact. \n\nFrom the opening sequence to the subtle transitions, there is not a single moment that felt off to me during my viewing of La La Land. When this film began with a seemingly continuous take, I was already hooked. From then on, this film was finding new ways to impress me in more ways than one. Whether it was subtle callbacks to moments from Singin' in the Rain or making a film fan like me drool at the site of an imitated shot from Rebel Without a Cause, this was classic Hollywood filmmaking at its finest. The visual effects in certain sequences only added to the film and the fact that almost every high-end extravagant-looking sequences was done practically, just goes to show that this film needs even more recognition than it's already receiving. \n\nThe 2000s have given us musicals in Moulin Rouge!, Chicago, Dreamgirls, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Hairspray, and Les Miserables. There are many I left out there, but you get the point. I have seen most of the aforementioned pictures and I can say with the utmost confidence that La La Land is the best musical since 2000. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone share impeccable chemistry, but audiences should not be surprised by this. They both give award-level performances, the music is stellar and memorable, it makes you feel amazing, the direction is off the charts, and the imagery is something that you would find in a classic Hollywood picture from the 50s. There are a few instances where I felt the film would go into cliches, but there is a reason that everything is shown on screen. I loved every minute of La La Land and it's one of the best films of 2016.",

It's absolutely electrifying. There's a big musical number before the movie even really starts and at that moment I knew we had a special film on our hands. \n\nEmma Stone is coming for that Oscar. Her and Ryan Gosling were dynamite as a pair. We all need to be very thankful that Ryan Gosling got this role and not Miles Teller. Teller would not have worked for this role at all. Gosling and Stone were SO perfect.\n\nNot only is the film a joy to listen to but it's also a thing of beauty to look at. It's visuals looked like they came right out of a dream. This film has so much engery and charisma; I couldn't help but to smile during the entire movie. La La Land is 2 hours of cinematic bliss to the highest degree\n\nThe bad thing about me seeing it so early is the fact I'm not going to be able to see it again until December. I need and want to see it again right now. I'm going to have to resort to watching the trailer on repeat just to get my fix in. \n\n\nP.S. I may never stop whistling City of Stars.\n\nP.S.S. I cannot wait to own this movie on Blu-Ray and watch it on a weekly basis.",

It totally revives the movie musical in the most magical way possible\"\nMovie Review: La La Land\nDate Viewed: January 2 2017\nWritten and Directed By Damien Chazelle (Whiplash)\nStarring: Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, John Legend, Rosemarie DeWitt, Finn Wittrock, Sonoya Mizuno, Callie Hernandez, Jessica Rothe, Tom Everett Scott, Meagan Fay and J.K. Simmons.\n\nDamien Chazelle's \"La La Land\" is a mind-blowing spectacular. It totally revives the movie musical in the most magical way possible. The writing is pitch-perfect and the performances are top-notch. Even though \"La La Land\" takes place in the modern present, it still has the charm, passion and feel from those classic MGM musicals from the 1950s and early 60s like \"Guys and Dolls\" and \"West Side Story\".\n\n\"La La Land\" tells the story of an aspiring actress and struggling jazz musician who meet up and try to find their place in the world. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have amazing chemistry together, the songs are terrific and this picture has a heart that's tough to crack. It's one of the best movies of 2016.\n\nThe movie greatly begins with an opening musical number on a crowded highway in Los Angeles where all the drivers get out of their cars and sing \"Another Day of Sun\". After that delightful scene, we jump to an aspiring actress named Mia (Stone) as tries out auditions for possible roles. She later hangs out with her roommates at a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills but she decides to go to a gig at a restaurant where she meets a struggling jazz musician named Sebastian (Gosling) who Mia earlier encountered during a moment of road rage. Sebastian later gets fired by the restaurant's owner (J.K. Simmons) for not playing the songs on the setlist and for his disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him for his beautiful song but Sebastian furiously brushes her off.\n\nSeveral months later, Mia and Sebastian meet up again at a party where he plays for a pop cover band. After the gig and teasing Sebastian a little, the two of them walk together to find their cars and they talk about their passions for their two different arts. Sebastian dreams about becoming a famous jazz musician and opening up a jazz club for himself and Mia dreams about becoming an actress and hitting it big in Hollywood.\n\nMia's passion for acting is in there but apparently that's not enough as she fails more auditions but she decides to take Sebastian's suggestion and that is writing a personal single-actress play. As Sebastian begins to perform jazz more regularly, his relationship with Mia grows more romantic and they move in together.\n\nSoon, Sebastian meets up with an old high school classmate, Keith (John Legend) and he wants him to be the keyboardist in his jazz band. Sebastian is dismayed by the group's pop-oriented style but he still joins the band anyway as their keyboardist and this news disturbs Mia as she and Sebastian argue over their careers and their relationships. The ending maybe hard for some viewers to swallow and is much different from most musical movies but \"La La Land\" is an old-fashioned musical that works on it's own merits and it earns it's five stars.\n\nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone previously worked together and had a romantic relationship in the 2011 comedy \"Crazy, Stupid, Love\" but it was a different kind of movie, their relationship in this movie fires on all cylinders and their performances shine as brightly as the bright lights of Los Angeles. Writer and director Damien Chazelle (who previously helmed the hardcore musical drama \"Whiplash\") could've turned \"La La Land\" into another musical extravaganza with sheer lunacy and annoying supporting characters but not this time, he turns \"La La Land\" into an enchanting musical with hard-headed bite, delightful songs, great performances and a real sense of place.\n\nSome people have said that the movie musical is dead. They should talk to movie critics and the Academy voters and explain why because \"La La Land\" is one of the best musicals I have seen.",

            "content": "Oh, La La Land, how the hype has been real. We all know how incredible Whiplash, writer/director Damien Chazelle's last effort, was so it makes sense that so many people, including myself, were excited about this, and... it's good. It's not amazing; it's not great; it's not really good. It has pacing and script issues and the story and themes are very derivative. The nostalgia goes overboard at times, but it still works more often than not. Emma Stone is fantastic, though, and the music is great. It's fun, cute, and with terrific cinematography. It isn't worthy of the hype, but succeeds in its own right. Mia (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actor that works as a barista while Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a pianist who wants to open up his own jazz club. The two cross paths a few times and form a relationship, which eventually is tested by their attempting to follow their respective dreams. Oh, and there's a good amount of singing because this is a musical. The music is great and--speaking as a person that doesn't like musicals and usually finds them to be hard to get behind--mixed with the choreography makes for something easier to swallow. It does seem as if Chazelle's reach exceeds his grasp one or two times, namely with musical numbers made to look like single takes but with pretty obvious filmmaking and editing tricks. Nonetheless, the beautiful look to the movie and Stone's range make it possible to forgive this to an extent. The softness to the aesthetic in the nighttime scenes mixed with the bold color palettes on display at time demonstrate Chazelle's eye to create a mood with a shot. However, it's largely Chazelle's ability to capture the joy and humor that fits with this material and the Old Hollywood glamor that it pays tribute to. Still, in my opinion, La La Land isn't close to the perfection that others have painted it to be. As mentioned earlier, Chazelle's script relies too heavy on nostalgia in leu of creating its own uniqueness and there are pacing issues and unsatisfying character portrayals due to his script. The movie seems to peak before the halfway point, leading the following 20 minutes or so to feel like a slog. I checked the time and thought to myself, \"Wait, there's over another hour of this?\" The energy takes a hit afterwards. Similarly, John Legend's character is ditched and has not much of a resolution once he isn't in the forefront. And although I've praised the music and most of the musical numbers, the opening sequence has some pretty questionable lip syncing and I instead sat there thinking, \"Oh, that's fake.\" My criticisms with La La Land may sound like I didn't like it, but I did. It's a good movie; it isn't great and it has obvious flaws. The successes that the filmmakers display here are generally wide and therefore don't give a lot to comment on, while the errors are smaller, but there are more to speak of. Some scenes feel like magic and a lot are cute, and the movie as a whole has a fair amount going for it. I'm glad that I saw it, but I won't see it again. 7.7/10, good, B, above average, etc.",

The film hold your attention until the credits roll, and then some. I can't say I've ever had a movie give me such a roller coaster of emotions, its beautiful and funny while being heartbreaking and  frustrating. \n\nThe characters have been well thought out and are completely solid; the acting is on point and they are entire believable. Damien Chazelle continues his obvious love for jazz in this film and it works perfectly. The music is infectious, the story is enthralling,and the sets are over-the-top glamorous. I VERY highly recommend that everyone see this movie! Bring the family or go on a date night, either way it will surely captivate you!",

Gosling and Stone showcase their chemistry yet again in this spectacularly shot, beautifully composed, and brilliantly choreographed feature worthy of every Academy Award it won. Damien Chazelle writes a candid, heartwarming story perfectly fitting for a retro musical rooted in the past despite its contemporary setting. Everything from the costumes to the performances takes you back to a time when life was much simpler and joyful and that is a unique quality that no longer transcends through modern movies. Of all the things to love about La La Land it's the ending that leaves you in tears and sniffing as \"The End\" appears before the credits roll, but the fond memory of how incredibly enjoyable the experience was will surely put a smile on your face.",

Almost every year, most good if not great Oscar-worthy films have been, for the most part, dramas overrun with moodiness and gravitas. So when you hear about a completely original musical set in present-day based on elements of classics from decades prior, it's easy to be skeptical. But what makes this film stand out isn't just its musicality, but the honesty in its intentions. No, it doesn't have a stereotypical Hollywood ending where everything turns out as you think it will, but in a way, that almost makes it that much more grounded and thought-provoking. This film's artistic backdrops, long takes, buttery-smooth editing, and jazzy tone all work seamlessly with the story - making this, by far, the most upbeat prospective Best Picture nominee of the year. Yet what this movie also does well is call into question how meaningful our success is, and whether or not it's worth the sacrifices made along the way to achieve our dreams.",

            "content": "When it comes to my anticipated movies, this one, believe it or not, is actually my most anticipated movie of 2016! YEAH, I actually anticipated this film even more than Rogue One! Another interesting thing to note is that this is the first that a musical is my most anticipated film of the year! Seriously, ever since I saw the teaser for this film and read about what it was about, I was hooked. I knew I couldn't miss out. But another thing that made me anticipated for this is the fact that this film came from director Damien Chazelle, who previously directed one of my favorite films of the 2014, \"Whiplash\". That alone, sealed the deal and made me say, \"Yep! I am soooo seeing this!\" So now that my most anticipated film has hit the big screen, will it make me want to follow my own dreams and live in LA, or will this just make me wish I were deaf from the start? Let's find out by taking a look at \"La La Land\".\n\nTHE STORY\nSo the movie follows these two people who are trying to pursue their dreams despite the fact that they live in Los Angeles, where dreams are known for getting crushed. They cross paths for the first time, they end up falling in love, and we get to see their story as a team, while also incorporating musical numbers along the way. On one hand, you make think this story has been done numerous times, but believe it or not, the story is actually, ORIGINAL! For the first time in so long, we have an actual story that is original in a movie! And also, it's execution is PERFECT! You can really tell that Chazelle really went deep into making the story original and very engaging from beginning to end. Rather it be Mia and Sebastian's story, Sebastian himself trying to pursue his jazz career in an era where Jazz is dying, or Mia trying to be an actress but her auditions always get screwed. Another thing that helps the stories execution is definitely the musical numbers, from the moment that this film opens with it's big fun song to the ending with a more serious song, the musical numbers even out the time we get to have a story told and the fun we have while hearing these songs. (I'll get more into the songs a little bit later.) For the first time in over a few decades, we've got a movie with an original story that is beautiful and very well executed!\n\nTHE VISUALS\nWith an original story that is perfectly executed, you can also expect the visuals to look perfect. And the visuals in this movie definitely exceed my expectations. They really mix the idea of an older Los Angeles and modern day Los Angeles perfectly to the point where you think you're in a whole new world. And it really does look beautiful. Another amazing aspect of the visuals is easily the use of the camera. The camera operators don't constantly cut away from one shot to another giving the audience members like me a headache and a hard time trying to focus on what's going on. Instead, the camera movements are smooth, the follow the action and the amount of pans and 360's used in the film really make it easier for the film to watch, especially when there's a musical number going on. Also, another little thing I like is how certain parts of the film pay homage to the classic movies of the early to mid 1900s, like the copyright label at the bottom of the screen when the title card appears. But the true highlights in the visuals are the lighting and especially some of the other special effects. The lighting in the film really suits the style of the film well and also helps make the musical numbers really engaging, especially during the musical numbers as well. Like how the lights would go out and focus on whoever was singing or if there was a performance going on, or the sunset during Sebastian singing on the dock, the list goes on. But there was one part of the film where the visuals really looked top notch, and that was the scene with the observatory. I won't say much about it since I don't want to spoil anything, but I'll just say once you see the movie, then you'll know what I mean. Not only is the story perfectly executed, but the visuals are perfectly done as well!\n\nTHE CHARACTERS\nThere aren't very many characters to talk about in this movie, so I'm only going to talk about the ones we focus on in the film. But just because there aren't many characters, doesn't take away any perfection that this movie has. For the few characters we have in this movie, they really are perfect. First up, we have Sebastian, he is a dedicated jazz musician who's plan is to open up his own jazz club where no one can tell him what to play and when to play it. But joins a band with an old friend for a while which interferes with his relationship with Mia. At first glance, you may think he's a total douchebag just by looking at him at the start, but when you see what he has to go through, you really feel for him and it shows that he's doing everything he can to try and succeed, even if he's getting screwed over by those around him. Which really makes you want him to succeed. Then we have our other main character Mia, she's an aspiring actress who starts off as a coffee shop barista but wants to live big in LA and star in a big Hollywood movie, which is really difficult for her considering that every audition she goes to, something always goes wrong and the people just blow her off like a bug on a piece of clothing. You can really feel the struggles that Mia is going through and it shows that despite giving up at times, she wants to succeed in life. As for the other characters like Mia's roommates, Sebastian's bandmates, and the others, they don't really have that much screentime, but you can really tell that they have a purpose in this film and it really helps push the story of our two main characters forward. Just when you thought that there would be flaws with the characters, here they as perfect as can be.\n\nTHE SONGS\nAnd now it's time for what I have been dying to talk about throughout this review, the musical numbers. There are a total of 5 original songs in this movie, and each of them are very well executed and as I said before, they really push the story forward with its execution and help the visuals look better than ever. From the very beginning with \"Another Day Of Sun\" to the introduction of Mia's life with \"Someone in the Crowd\" sung by her roommates, to the moment when Sebastian and Mia first meet with \"A lovely Night\", and when Mia has a big audition of her life, with \"The Fools Who Dream\" which actually has a very interesting backstory to it. But the one song that stands out in the film is easily what I would consider the theme of this movie, \"City Of Stars\". \"City Of Stars\" perfectly sums up the movie's theme of trying to pursue your dreams with a melodic and very well executed beat and tone that helps fit the scene that happening in the movie. The songs in this movie are not only well executed, but they're very well written as well. Seriously, you can really tell that the songwriters have lots of talent and were at their full potential with these songs! Which really helps make these songs very infectiously catchy and make you want to get up and dance along with the people on screen. When it comes to musicals, it usually takes a lot for the songs to be perfect, with Damien Chazelle and his crew, that was not a problem under any circumstances.\n\nI'll be honest with you guys, when I went into this film, I had very high expectations. But, when I got out, not only did they meet my expectations, But they beyond exceeded them! La La Land is not only one of the best films of 2016, but it is also, without a doubt, one of the best movies of all time! The story is very well executed and engaging, the visuals are beyond perfection, the characters are very loveable and have great chemistry, and the songs are infectiously catchy and make the movie fun to watch! I definitely recommend that you check this film out immediately, if you haven't seen it yet, then what the hell is wrong with you? Go see this movie any chance you get! It's very rare that a musical would be this high up in the ranks of my favorite films of the year, and all it took was Damien Chazelle and his crew, Ryan Gosling, and Emma Stone to make that all possible. This is a film that will be remembered for many generations and I know for a fact this will immediately be in my Blu-Ray collection when it comes out! No doubt about it that it gets the RoboSparta Seal Of Approval, but it took me a lot of thinking about it's rating. I almost would never do this for any movie at all, like ever. But for a movie of this calibur, I think it's time to make a milestone here.\n\nSTORY: 10/10\nVISUALS: 10/10\nCHARACTERS: 10/10\nSONGS: 10/10\n\nFINAL SCORE: 10/10 - \"PERFECT!!!!!!\"",

But after watching this gem of a film, I'm now willing to say that musicals may not be so bad.\n\nLa La Land, is, in my opinion, probably going to be the best film of 2016, and will go down as one of the all time best in the musical genre, and one of the films in this decade. What a movie. From the start, it brings you a long a beautiful musical journey. Captivating you with brilliant cinematography and wonderful story telling. To think that this is director Damien Chazelle's second major picture after Whiplash. Whiplash was a great film, but La La Land blows it away. \n\nA mix of old school movie magic mixed in with new school thoughts and vibes, this musical does wonders in every department. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone bring electricity to each and every scene, whether it be the songs they sing and dance to, or the acting side of their overall performance. The camera work does wonders, bringing a classic view to modern day L.A., and also bringing out the colours and visuals that are around us. Music by Justin Hurtwitz does wonders, with the smashing flow of the jazz scene mixed in with the usual bombastic musical scores you would find in a musical.\n\nWe live in a world where there is sadly, usually, bad news than good. This film, with it's 2 hours or so of run time, bring a sense of joy and happiness that makes you forget about all the negativity that the world has to offer. This is what film making is all about! We need more films like this, and once it releases to a wider audience, I'm sure you will all love it as well!\n\nHere's to the crazy ones, and the fools who dream.\n\n(I've been humming the tunes since watching the film, and honestly, never realized how nice Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's singing voices are!)",

Tears, great choreography, and some extremely humable score makes La La Land a sure fire front runner for multiple Oscar nominations most notably for music, cinematography, art direction which also was superb and for leading actress Emma Stone whose character suits her to a tee.

Everything I found smug and irritating about Hail, Caesar! earlier this year, comes off so much more authentic and earnest and ridiculously charming in this movie. Gosling and Stone are pitch fucking perfect together onscreen, like a classic pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers or some shit like that. It really is that good. I loved the director's previous effort Whiplash, but this is so much more fun and beautifully realized. The long shots and surreal backgrounds make it feel like it was adapted from a famous Broadway musical, and it probably will be turned into one after this sweeps the award season. It will make you fall in love with movies and movie-making all over again and inspire people to go after their dreams. The ending is bittersweet and a little too neat in regards to how everything turns out, but I love this movie and it will probably be in my top 10 for the year and is definitely the deserved frontrunner for Best Picture of the year.

            "content": "Since its first seconds, Damien Chazelle transports us into his colourful and unashamedly nostalgic Los Angeles. Seducing us with his intricate portrayal of the balance between the mundane and the magic that compose this city, we are engaged through the lenses of his two passions: classic cinema and jazz.\n\nThe references, visual queues and homages to the likes of Jacques Demy, Gene Kelly, Chaplin, Fred and Ginger, etc. are constant and abound, but they never overstay their welcome thanks to the film wearing its heart on its sleeve and being so sincere and open about where it draws inspiration from (an argument could be make about it being basically an adaptation of Les Parapluies de Cherbourg).\n\nThe execution is, for the most part, showy and ostentatious, but it is in line with the homage to the big studio excesses of Hollywood's golden era and the concept of Los Angeles as this cultural behemoth. The frenetic array of joy feels totally earned, but Chazelle still finds moments to ground the film and contain it for his narrative purposes. This works perfectly for the eventual disenchantment of Mia and Sebastian's relationship, but not as much when the subplot with John Legend and a jazz rock band kicks in and deviates the film from its essence: the highs and lows of this romance between two people striving for their dreams.\n\nEmma Stone and Ryan Gosling work well as this characters, bringing nuances and making their romantic foray feel palpable, from its quirky comedic beginnings to its inherently melancholic progression. Stone does clearly overshadows her partner by seeming more engaged and real than Gosling`s jazz snob caricature, tho.\n\nIn the musical aspect, it is really outstanding. The main melodies and motifs draw again from the sentimental sensibilities of Michel Legrand, and even if lacking in comparison, composer Justin Hurwitz does manage to stand on his own here.\n\nYes, it is cliched, over the top, and for moments self-indulgent (that revisiting at the end is beautiful to look at, but its impact pails in comparison to the subtlety of the Demy epilogue Chazelle clearly tries to emulate), but all the same, La La Land embraces this and goes for it, managing to be an effectively endearing experience that is bolstered by its pure charm.",

It was so magical, visually stunning, and the songs will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. And, despite La La Land being a musical, when people weren't singing and dancing it still had the feeling of a regular movie, which made the story itself captivating. \nI don't think Emma Stone has ever given a better performance than this. She was good in Birdman, sure, but she soared in La La Land. One scene in particular that sticks out to me is \"The Audition\", during which she was able to sing a beautiful solo while the camera circled around her; all in one take. On the contrary, my only criticism is that Ryan Gosling wasn't doing much acting while he was singing and dancing. He is a very gifted singer, and a lovely dancer, but his face remained a little deadpan during musical numbers. \nBut the whole movie is damn near perfect. It was interesting story-wise, the music was fantastic, it made me happy, sad, and made me dance in my seat. \nBut what really makes this movie, to me, is the ending sequence. That was what made La La Land \"perfect\". It tied everything together so beautifully, but also left some room for the viewer to do their own thinking, and it even made me, who has cried during only one other movie ever, shed a tear. \nLa La Land is surely going to make cinematic history. It's new and exciting, and it's an experience you surely won't want to miss it.",

So if you think the Goose is a dud or Emma looks like Pepe the frog meme or \"Whiplash\" is pretentious, we are going to disagree. Well, she does kind of look like Pepe, but that's not the point. As a person who has had to cringe their way through many a musical, I did not cringe once during \"La La Land\". Maybe that's because it is only partly a musical. There are quite a few musical sequences, and they are immaculately choreographed. The color design and cinematography in general are just gorgeous. There have been a few \"ode to old Hollywood\" films out this year like \"Hail, Caesar!\", and \"Allied\", but this film seems to be more nonchalant when going about it. It is also about jazz but to a much lesser degree than \"Whiplash\". As Goose and Stone's chemistry go, there are few actors that are as charismatic as these two, and there is never a crack in their characters. They play their roles as if they were Sebastian and Mia, probably because they lived a very similar life to them at one time. The movie might be old Hollywood more because it is a simple love story that never gets too gory with the details, but its modern sensibilities help to shed the melodrama. Instead we are presented with a realistic relationship in a fantastic setting, where sometimes things don't quite work out like we imagined, and it's not anyone's fault in particular. Finally, there is a lot of buzz about this going into awards season. I won't say it isn't justified because there aren't that many modern filmmakers that are as audacious as Chazelle in the scope of what he has accomplished. But for a musical, the music doesn't seem to be the top priority, for better or worse.",

Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) come together to create a wonderful production, but a lesser known yet ever present cast member is the city itself.

Some might argue that the city is a backdrop to the songs and dancing of Sebastian and Mia, but the city itself takes center stage with the vibrancy of a leading man. It lends its beauty to be danced upon by Sebastian and Mia without relinquishing its hold as being the center of attention.\n\nrest of review: taziostake.com",

            "content": "\"La La Land\" is a film full of dreams and aspirations filled with a lovable romance, amazing performances, and a heartfelt story. \n\nWritten and directed by Academy Award (R) nominee Damien Chazelle, LA LA LAND tells the story of Mia [Emma Stone], an aspiring actress, and Sebastian [Ryan Gosling], a dedicated jazz musician, who are struggling to make ends meet in a city known for crushing hopes and breaking hearts. Set in modern day Los Angeles, this original musical about everyday life explores the joy and pain of pursuing your dreams.\n\nMan it's official. Damien Chazelle has potentially created the two top films of their respective years in \"Whiplash\" (2014) and now, \"La La Land\" (2016). With \"Whiplash\" being my favorite movie of all time, I was more than excited to see what Chazelle had for us next. Turns out, he produced one of my favorite films of 2016, and easily my favorite musical of all time.\n\nRyan Gosling plays a jazz pianist who's looking to salvage what's left of jazz and make a career for himself. He plays the character of Sebastian, who's kind of a bitter guy all around. In fact in the first few times we meet him, he's kind of an asshole. But despite what he's gone through and the troubles he's faced, he's a passionate human for jazz and he truly believes in what he's doing. I think the most inspiring thing in life is to see passion and feel passionate about something. Seeing just how passionate someone is about something is one of the most uplifting and inspiring things to experience, and you can absolutely see the joy and dedication his character has to jazz. It's the truth, jazz is a dying art and as a drummer/pianist myself, it really is hard to see. But Gosling puts on an amazing performance and Chazelle continues to show us people who are truly passionate about what they do.\n\nEmma Stone is an aspiring, yet struggling actress who's trying to make a name for herself. As she trudges through countless auditions with the same result each time, it feels like she's in an dream with no happy ending. Emma Stone plays the character of Mia, who faces the difficult challenges and brutal life of Hollywood. Her character goes through so many rough patches and the fact that it's so real makes it sad to see. But Emma Stone was wonderful in this film and the energy and personality she brought to her character was irreplaceable. \n\nThe chemistry between these two was electric. I loved seeing this power couple on screen with the way they talk to each other, interact, dance, sing, and their conflict with one another. They mesh so well and this movie is a romance movie under the cover, and they truly make it feel genuine. In fact, the romance aspect of the film was my favorite part! Together, they make their love seem so real and natural, while it's simultaneously heartbreaking at the same time. This is the romance movie of the year.\n\nNormally, musicals put numbers in the most awkward stages or it's executed really cheesy, but the score of this movie was fantastic. I loved the score and the soundtrack and I was tapping and dancing to the rhythms throughout. The music was beautiful and so appropriate for the moments. The choreography for the dance was more than impressive, with many one takes and fun segments to watch. The singing felt very real which is a major positive. Gosling and Stone aren't the PERFECT singers in the world, but they are really good. Whenever their characters sing, they don't sound all auto-tuned and what not, but it sounds like their genuine voices. I liked that they weren't always perfectly on pitch, even if they were damn close. The music in this film was amazing and I can't wait to get the full album. \n\nChazelle has now created this reputation for these musically based films involving passion and dreams. Although completely different from \"Whiplash\", both films involve characters trying to follow their dreams and their dedication to their craft. I loved the story and the screenplay of this film, with dreams being the main message of the film. This story is so complex yet relatable and it's one of my favorites of the year. The dialogue was so interesting and attention grabbing, as Chazelle really knows how to craft conflict and dialogue.\n\nThis film is also just so fun, yet so heartbreaking. I truly came out of this with the biggest smile on my face. In a time that's been rough and confusing, this is one of those relatable, funny, and inspiring films that I needed to see. I guarantee you'll feel a little something in your heart by the time this film concludes. \n \nIn the end, I absolutely loved \"La La Land\". It's one of my favorite films of 2016, and easily my favorite musical of all time. I can't wait to see what else Chazelle puts out for us in the future, and I hope I see another Gosling/Stone duo in the near future.",

            "content": "After watching this film at the Chicago International Film Festival, my original plan was to wait until closer to the film's actual release date to give my thoughts on it. However, after sitting with it for two days, with the images and sounds still sweeping through my mind, I cannot help myself. I will be as vague as possible, because I do not want to ruin the experience of seeing it for the first time, but I have to talk about it.\n\nLa La Land, as it has been advertised, pays homage to classic movie musicals. Not only does it visually allude to films such as Singin' in the Rain and The Band Wagon, but it also preserves the upbeat, wondrous tone of those classics. There is something wonderful about seeing this  tone and style recreated for a modern film. Cynicism and pretentiousness are completely absent from this film, and nostalgia and joy take their place. \n\nBut calling La La Land a terrific recreation of the classic movie musical is selling it short. Like director Damien Chazelle's previous work, La La Land has much more going on narratively than the movie may lead people to believe. On the surface, this is a love story about two artists trying to make their ways in Los Angeles. However, this framework is deceptively simple. \n\nLa La Land forces us to think about the realities of personal relationships and artistic endeavors. It explores the excitement of our dreams, the hardships of pursuing these dreams, and forces the audience to question the importance of both. Fortunately, Chazelle never looks down on the audience with these ideas. They are not presented in a heavy handed manner, and he never forces you to think a certain way.\n\nOn top of its thematic richness, La La Land has one of the best understandings of film as a storytelling medium that I have seen in recent years. On the surface, it is the most technically astounding. The cinematography is stunning, and the soundtrack is beautiful. Even better is that both the visuals and soundtrack are never used in a way that is shallow or uninteresting. La La Land has an understanding of how to tell a story visually. It understands the power of sequencing, the power images can have on the emotional impact of a story, and the way in which these images simultaneously indulge our fantasies and remind us of our humanity. \n\nIn other words, for me, it embodies everything that I love about movies.\n\nThere are instances that everyone can recall in a cinema where we have felt what I like to call \"movie magic.\" These are evoked by the films that completely absorb us into its world, and movies that have a lasting, personal impact on us far beyond the theater. They are the films that we hold as the pinnacle of what makes watching movies so great.\n\nLa La Land is one of those movies. \n\nDuring its 128 minute running time, the only times I wanted to look away from the screen was to turn to the people around me and check and see the faces of those around me to see if they were experiencing the same kind of magic that I was. I can affirm that everyone I saw in my theater was. \n\nLa La Land is a masterpiece. It is not only the best movie of 2016 so far, but also possibly one of the best of the decade. It's spectacular, stunning, moving, and absolutely magical.",

Shot in CinemaScope, and yet it's still an intimate masterpiece with vibrant Colour pallet inspired by Jacques Demy's musical films. Although it's set in a bygone era of Hollywood musical film, La La Land never feels dated thanks to Composer Justin Hurwitz talented song writing, making his characters never come-off as Westend stars, instead the smooth musical transition feels grounded as they are real people.",

The story is a little lacking in spots.

With modern day Los Angeles as the backdrop, this musical about everyday life explores what is more important: a once-in-a-lifetime love or the spotlight.\n\nBack in 2014, there was a film called \"Whiplash\" that blew everyone away, including me. It was my 2nd favorite movie of that year and I had my eye out for the director next project. Wasn't very long until Damien Chazelle next film in was in post-production and was already a serious Oscar contender. I think \"La La Land\" and \"Silence\" was my most anticipated movies of 2016/17. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.\n\n\"La La Land\" is one of the best musicals I've seen since \"Sweeney Todd\" and \"Singing in the Rain\". It's a movie that lifts your spirit up and leaves you smiling though out. Even with today's generation of loud politics, four years of Trump, celebrities dying, and endless amount of pointless controversy. But then comes a musical about two people who are dreamers, that deal with inn conflict and show how dreams can lead to success. By making the impossible possible while living in a place where dreams come to die.\n\nRyan Gosling and Emma Stone were both dynamite in this movie. The relationship was sweet and relatable that I actually cared for what was going on. Even with the singing and dancing use as a tool that the characters express their happiness, sadness or disappointment was terrific. This is the best I've seen from Stone and Gosling. Both of them sparkle in this musical.\n\nDamien Chazelle, what can I say about this guy. Chazelle as a film making is both amazing and inspirational. He's on a roll recently and if he's next two movies are brilliant, then he is the best living director today. In \"La La Land\", he follows a similar theme in his previous movie \"Whiplash\" about fighting for a dream and jazz, but this movie goes for more a light tone than a dark one. For the dramatic elements of the movie, I really like how he lets it go on for awhile as an emotional effect. He also got an eye for spectacle, because LA never looked so beautiful and fairy tale-like. What else is there to say, but Chazelle nailed it.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, but the last shot of this movie was so beautiful and yet sad at the same time. Chazelle sure knows how to end his movies and that's with a powerful punch.\n\nMy only complaint I have with the movie is that a few scenes could've been trimmed a bit, as it dragged for me. And while the homages to old musicals were fitting, but some was a bit down your throat. I wouldn't say repetitive (because it's not), but more of a \"alright, I get it\" kind of complaint. That's really it for flaws.\n\nOverall rating: \"La La Land\" is simply wonderful. It's a firework of joy and excitement that it's really hard not to fall in love with it. I'm already looking forward to \"First Man\".",

The movie's many musical numbers are amazingly choreographed and performed and they enhance the story instead of detracting from it. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling act with finesse and palpable, real emotion, as Chazelle slowly brings us into their world and lets us in on their dreams. Their chemistry is infectious and there is lot of attention put in the dialog between them, in order to create a believable relationship. This is a musical of uncommon depth, that delves into to deep emotional territory. La La Land is a pure delight for anyone that loves music, movies, romance or dancing.

As for performances, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are superbly endearing and their chemistry is dynamite. Despite all the romance and music though, this was not at all cliche, which is huge praise. Damien Chazelle's passion for this film is seeping through every shot. The cinematography is gorgeous. I can't believe what I saw tonight. I spent the whole film looking for a flaw but I just couldn't find one. I saw one critic say \"I haven't seen anyone leave this movie in a bad mood\" and I must agree, the sense of euphoria when you leave this film is riveting.

            "content": "La La Land is directed and written by Damien Chazelle, and it stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in a romantic musical film about a struggling girl name Mia (Emma Stone) that wants to be an actress, but has to deal with bunch of auditions that doesn't take notice of her, and has job issues that take her out of it, which Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is going through a bit of a similar issue when trying to make a career out of making jazz music. This is one of the most anticipated films of 2016 as this is from the same director that did Whiplash which was the best film of 2014 for me, and it's a musical film, which we don't get this often nowadays, and the recent film that I've seen and know that's close to this year, is Stage Fright 3 years ago, which was poorly reviewed by both critics and audience, and it's not well known as it barely made any money. While I still didn't watch it, seeing the movie get a lot of recognitions made me really happy as the director is becoming more well known for his films, and that Emma Stone got her first Oscar, which good for her on that. I wanted this to be the last film from the 2016 Academy Award Best Picture movie route because I want to see this the most, and it'll build up from the films I wasn't that excited over, to this which I was definitely looking forward to. So was it worth it? Well, seeing from the star rating, you already know the answer to that as La La Land is one of the best films of 2016. Emma Stone is absolutely fantastic in this as you can tell that she's been doing this for years, and she keeps being disappointed about the auditions as she does a good job also in the auditions, but the casting people just doesn't care and is just looking for someone with a more attractive look, and it makes you really root for that character to make her wish come true. The same can be said for Ryan Gosling as he's just as terrific as Emma Stone, and that kind of role can easily backfire as he's a bit of a jerk, but it wasn't a problem for Gosling as he's very likable here and has some hilarious moments, and you can tell that the way he talks about jazz in a deep way, he's very passionate about the genre, but not in a very snobbish or egotistical way because he genuinely believes that jazz is dying, which I can see from his perspective as you don't hear jazz songs nowadays, and the recent jazz that I heard, was surprisingly from Damien Chazelle's previous film Whiplash. The chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling is great that you totally believe that they're in love with each other and care for one another. The singing from the actors is very well done as while they're not broadway singing material there, it still fits their characters as Emma Stone's voice is a bit light-hearted and friendly, while Ryan Gosling has a bit of a soft raspy voice, and they are having with what they're singing about. The dance scenes are entertaining to watch, and I find it impressive that there are some moves that last for a long time, but the actors are making it seem effortless. The score by Justin Hurwitz is really catchy to listen to with some great songs that are from Pasek and Paul. The story is well done that you want to see how the plot unfolds for the characters as you want to see them succeed in what they want. The first part is very reminiscent of old musical movies, which the first scene with the traffic and the first song is definitely one of those moments. When it goes to the second half, it starts to maybe be close to a drama play with a little bit of music to it, which I was surprised by it, and was appreciative of it as they fit together in the film. The shots are really cool to look at, the writing is well-written, and while Whiplash has one of the best endings to a film that I've seen, this one has an ending that is a very bittersweet moment that has the right kind of sentimental to the main characters that is perfect with some great coloring and costumes.

            "content": "La La Land is a 2016 American musical romantic comedy film written and directed by Damien Chazelle. \nThis musical is really and modern take on the old-fashioned story of boy meets girl. But with a twist. It is quirky and different in so many ways, yet it has a retro feel and sound. I really enjoyed so many moments in this film. Stone is outstanding in her performance, yet I thought Gosling was often subdued and wooden, and I wonder if he was the correct choice here. The musical score is outstanding and the song 'City of Stars' is an absolute gem. But I thought there were a few too many jazz elements in the film, and also some slow patches in the third quarter. Tighter editing (and a shorter overall movie) would have eliminated this. Still it is enjoyable and the final 10 minutes are extraordinary when you realise what is happening. And the final scene, well, it will leave you sitting in your seat with either a smile or a tear on your face as you soak up the end credits. Upgraded from 7 to 8 on second viewing.

Keep in mind, this is a musical, so your mileage may vary due to that, but for me it was one of the best of the year.",

La La Land is in the mold of those Techinicolor musicals of the 50s. There are many stylistic touches that this has in common with those Gene Kelly toe-tappers and older Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers ones. Look at the scene represented by the poster (and the poster itself). There is a streetlamp right there and the choreography given to Gosling and Stone has very similar shapes and poses to traditional Hollywood musicals. Also within a month before having the opportunity to see La La Land we had watched Jacques Demy's French New Wave musical The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. The romantic plot where the young lovers don't actually spend most of the movie together and it ends with a melancholy tone seems to be borrowed straight from this other Techinicolor musical with less of the trappings of the Hollywood dream. At its simplest this is a combination of those two classics. There is a bunch of great music on this soundtrack that makes you feel a whole range of emotions. It draws you in with feelings of being alive in Another Day of Sun. It breaks your heart a little with Audition (The Fools Who Dream). Most of the music is written to convey romance. And the recurring theme song City of Stars is the perfect blend of romantic yearning and sadness.",
