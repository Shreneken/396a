    "summary": "It's Christmas 1183, and King Henry II (Peter O'Toole) is planning to announce his successor to the throne. The jockeying for the crown, though, is complex. Henry has three sons and wants his boy Prince John (Nigel Terry) to take over. Henry's wife, Queen Eleanor (Katharine Hepburn), has other ideas. She believes their son Prince Richard (Anthony Hopkins) should be king. As the family and various schemers gather for the holiday, each tries to make the indecisive king choose their option.",

            "content": "It is almost impossible to tell the story of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine badly. It is almost impossible to believe the people portrayed in \"Lion in Winter\" actually existed. But the truth was actually more melodramatic and implausible portrayed. As most of the other comments mention, the film's near greatness if largely due to the interaction of Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn. But Henry's sons must be mentioned. Anthony Hopkins shines in his film debut playing Richard I as more than 2-dimensional English idol portrayed in countless other films. Nigel Terry plays John I in way never presented before, and knowing John's history it is easy to believe he was that mistrustful, insecure, churlish and attempting to be scheming but not quite smart enough to carry it off! Timothy Dalton as Phillip II of France is fun to watch- now cagey, now slightly wicked, now callow and occasionally creepy. However, what most reviews don't mention is how bonkers and dysfunctional this whole family was. This was one of the most powerful family in British history and ruled one of the greatest empires of Europe. Though the entire movie is based on a fictional Christmas gathering near the end of Henry I's life. But in the loud (nearly violent) arguments, witty banter & scheming  is nearly the entire history of the dawn of the bloody Plantagenets. My only quibble with the film is showing Henry II and his family (rulers of England, some of Wales and Ireland, and half of France) living Monty Pythonesque squalor. Just one look at the modern renovation of Dover Castle to meticulously recreate it's appearance during the reign of Henry II reveals how grand and affluently they lived. Peter O'Toole's earlier portrayal of Henry II in \"Becket\" is a more authentic window to royal life in the late 12th century.",

A movie where u can't stand any of the characters, who make their own lives dreadful and partake in drama and misery for fun. The characters constantly are manipulating each other and lying. Not much happens at all by the end of this film, except exhausting u with their many schemes/plots that never take off. Ugh what a bore.",

            "content": "This feels like a spiritual successor to A Man for All Seasons (1966) in that it's a long, ponderous, boring British period drama in which great actors give wretched performances. I really disliked this film if you can't already tell as I found it to be absolutely tedious and it didn't even satisfy the requirements of a traditional costume drama because it's themes are not weighty or meaningful and the whole thing is a soap opera episode dressed up as prestige cinema. I can see why this film was director Anthony Harvey's only real hit because he doesn't manage to make the film feel like it's not a filmed play and draws the worst out of his talented cast. If you want to see a great period drama watch The Bostonians (1984), it's an underrated gem.\n\nThe imprisoned Eleanor of Aquitane, Katharine Hepburn, is allowed out of her cell on Christmas day to visit her philandering husband King Henry II, Peter O'Toole, as they try to decide which of their sons will become King. Henry favors the lovable but unintelligent John, Nigel Terry, while Eleanor sides with the manipulative and secretly homosexual Richard, Anthony Hopkins, which causes a lot of conflict as the announcement is yet to be made. Complicating things further is the fact that Eleanor and Henry still have feelings for each other even as he wants to annul their marriage to marry his young mistress Alais, Jane Merrow. Richard's lover King Philip II of France, Timothy Dalton, attempts to manipulate the situation and the brothers all eventually turn against their father but the film has a melancholy ending that suggests better times are ahead.\n\nThe biggest sin that the film commits is thinking that it is actually saying something. All of the verbose, flowery language that the actors spout as though it's the most important thing in the world serves as a sort of smokescreen to just how empty the film really is. The most exciting parts of the film came when Richard's homosexuality was revealed and his secret lover turned against him and when John almost killed his son but these are all plotlines handled with more grace and sensitivity in real soap operas like The Bold and the Beautiful. I didn't feel the passion and often felt like we spent heaps of time with situations that were fun for a few minutes but when dragged out just seemed ridiculous. If you want some trashy fun this isn't the film that will give it to you because it stretches out the camp for too long to be truly entertaining.\n\nThe performances are also shameful as Hepburn, O'Toole and Hopkins all disappoint me with performances reminiscent of Robert Shaw in A Man for All Seasons. In short, they are all pretty awful. In each scene they seem to be competing against one another to see who can chomp on the scenery more aggressively, this is not pleasant to watch. Hepburn is wonderful in The Philadelphia Story (1940), O'Toole is at his best in Venus (2006) and Hopkins is at his repressed British best in The Remains of the Day (1993). I would suggest you watch all of the films before you venture to watch this film that allows them all to indulge their worst habits as actors with Hepburn's irritating accent only becoming stronger as the film progresses and O'Toole relying too much on his eyes.\n\nI find it laughable that this film received a Best Picture nomination in 1968 over 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and it's representative of all that was wrong with the Academy's tastes. They value the names attached to the film more than the quality of the film itself and it's sad to see people who have done much better work in other films be rewarded for this tripe. If I were Barbra Streisand I would be offended that somebody had equated her spirited, entertaining performance in Funny Girl (1968) to Hepburn's awfulness in this shameful picture. People deserve better from historical period dramas and it's a shame that this film is one of the most famous examples of the genre when it's such a poor representation of what can be brilliant when done right.",

            "content": "The Lion in Winter is a movie about a dysfunctional royal family getting together for the holidays so they can argue for more than two hours about who will become king when Henry II dies. It has a star-studded cast and they get to do a lot of big acting with loud screaming speeches. There are a couple of scenes where anger isn\u2019t the primary emotion being experienced by everyone, so if you don\u2019t blink you might actually get to see some range from the actors. But almost the entire movie is bickering, and always centered on the same topic. Occasionally a new wrinkle will get thrown in, about a past relationship or some planned betrayal, but it never changes the primary thrust of the film. It is astounding how they can waste this much time arguing in circles, and constantly repeating the same thoughts and ideas. Just to reinforce how little happens in this movie and the fact that it has zero forward momentum in the plot, the end of the film shows a farewell as everyone goes back to the exact same positions they had at the start. There has been no change whatsoever, and every single thing that was threatened is never followed through. I don\u2019t need to watch a cavalcade of unpleasant people squabbling for that long, frankly it would almost be more pleasant to get in an argument myself. (At least then I\u2019d be invested in the topic that is being debated.) The Lion in Winter had potential as a period piece with an amazing cast, but it squandered its potential because it is almost a non-film that gives the illusion that things are happening and yet manages to do nothing. It\u2019s the stationary bike of movies, if you like the exercise of watching actors shout then you might enjoy it, but if you want to go anywhere it\u2019s best to watch something else.

I can see where Kubrick might have gotten inspiration for his zoom in's and zoom out's that he used in Barry Lyndon even though these are two completely different time periods.\n\nThe landscape shots are beautiful. I can see some blue and red reference with the jousting scene. And it's kind of uneasy to see how Geoffrey finds pleasure in killing people. The family dynamics in this movie are so uncommon. But then again, this is medieval movie and we are talking about kings and queens. \n\nKatherine Hepburn plays such a great part in this movie. I find her witty and clever dialogue very charming but ruthless at the same time. It's such an interesting movie because each character is vindictive or cruel or conniving, but you sort of care about what happens to them. At least I do. And how everyone is plotting against whomever for their own benefit.\n\nThis movie has some of the most phenomenal acting I've ever seen. Especially the dialogue between Eleanor and Henry. You can see they absolutely despise each other but it's with love. It's a very odd relationship which makes for an intriguing watch. Katherine Hepburn's speech about the origins of war really got to me. She states that it's people like them, \"the elites\" or \"the people in charge\", are the ones responsible for war, violence, and the many deaths of people. \n\nThe way some of the scenes in this movie unfold, you would swear that there just begging to be put into a theater play. There are so many good lines in this movie, it's ridiculous. A lot of great one-liners as well. What a twisted and unhealthy relationship between the family especially Henry and Eleanor.\n\nOverall, fantastic movie with some of the best dialogue I've ever heard in a movie. Tension so stout, you could cut it with a knife. Some of the best acting as well with a story line not even Shakespeare could dream of. Deception and guilt lies around every corner. This is a movie I will be revisiting again.",

Directed by Anthony Harvey with Goldman as the screenwriter, headlined by O'Toole and Hepburn, well, contrary to my expectation, it comes out as a rather enervating and mind-numbing non-starter. \n\nkeep reading my review on my blog: http://wp.me/p1eXom-1Zd",

However, what should be a relatively simple exercise is turned into an overly complex exercise in Machiavellian manipulation, lies and deceit.  Nothing is simple, and just when you think an issue is resolved, it unravels.\n\nInitially all this politics is intriguing, but it wears thin fairly quickly.  It soon resembles intrigue and politics for the sake of it, and serves only to pad the movie.\n\nThe ending is also quite lacklustre and anticlimactic after all the twists that went before.\n\nPowerful performance by Peter O'Toole in the lead role.  Too powerful, in that almost all his dialogue is shouted.  It gets quite irritating, quite quickly.  In fact his whole performance seemed a touch too over-the-top.\n\nSolid effort by Katharine Hepburn as Eleanor of Aquitaine.  The performance got her a Best Actress Oscar. \n\nInteresting also to see Anthony Hopkins in an early-career role: this was his second big-screen movie.\n\nEven more fresh-faced was Timothy Dalton as King Philip II of France.

            "content": "\"In the winter, the mighty winter, the lion sleeps around!\" Forget adultery, because there's also sibling rivalry, political unrest, family dysfunction, and other such junk to make this just about as stereotypical as a politically-charged drama set during 12th-century England can get. Naturally, it scored the Golden Globe for Best Drama, because from the mid to late '60s, the Globes were really getting into films like these, though not quite as much as Peter O'Toole. Shoot, I don't know if O'Toole was so much into politically-charged dramas set during 12th-century England, as much as he was just interested in Henry II, because, seriously, this is his second time playing the cat, and this film isn't even an official sequel to \"Becket\". He should have run through all of the Henrys and worked his way to Henry VIII, so that he could get a couple wives who were better-looking than Katharine Hepburn. No, Hepburn didn't look too shabby, but she was a little more masculine than O'Toole's character in this film, although I might just be thinking of the \"Becket\" Henry II who kept wining about missing his boyfriend... who was not played by Katharine Hepburn. Well, there is still plenty of saucy drama going on here, and it makes for quite the good movie, whose familiarity doesn't exactly end with O'Toole's role.\r\n\r\nBy nature of being a dialogue-driven period epic, this film is unique, but even then, you got plenty of this formula in \"A Man For All Seasons\" and \"Becket\", alone, and even though this film handles the formula better than, at the very least, the former, its familiarity as a should-be refreshing political and family drama makes it really difficult to ignore the other familiar aspects of this sort of subject matter. Still, it would be nice to grow more accustomed to the characters focused on in this film, at least enough to embrace them better, because even though the rich characterization and acting are there, they back morally problematic roles which compliment somewhat weighty histrionics as they do edgy themes. Set in a romantic time and a notoriously scandalous kingdom, and first interpreted in a stage drama, this subject matter is defined by its melodrama, but it's sometimes hard to embrace it, even in the context of this film, and whether that be because the characters are so questionable, or simple because the histrionics are occasionally too extreme, the film treks an almost contrived path, and a touch too steadily. The dialogue is sharp, and I don't know how much of it I would be willing to expend, but considering that it is the driving force of this 134-minute-long pseudo-epic, the final product gets to be a bit repetitious, and is ultimately way too blasted long, occasionally to where even the inspired momentum finds difficulty in securing dramatic momentum. The film is fairly entertaining in its flair, and certainly compelling in its sophistication, but it is a slowly paced affair that is sometimes too slow, resulting in bland, if not dull spots which challenge your attention in a narrative that, even in concept, proves to be a bit of a challenge to your investment. What might threaten this film as much as anything is its natural shortcomings as a non-epic of a political and family drama which is revolved around dialogue over action, and around characters who are intentionally problematic, but problematic nonetheless, limiting bite in concept which is further softened by elements of convention, melodrama and dragging. The final product is pretty flawed, and could have succumb to underwhelmingness, but what it does right it does so well that it very decidedly rewards, as a bitingly clever and dramatically juicy affair which immerses, with the help of solid art direction.\r\n\r\nAn intimate period melodrama, this film relies about as much on its setting as it does on its dialogue, thus, Peter Murton and the uncredited Lee Poll are meticulous in their crafting a recreation of the royal environment of 12th century England which is handsome and immersive in its distinctiveness, with a convincingness that is the first step towards selling this story. The subject matter's minimalism and melodramatics go a little too intensely stressed by draggy and, in other ways, somewhat overblown storytelling, and on top of all of that, most of the roles intimately focused upon are a little too flawed to be fully embraced, but as a study on the political and personal affairs of a dysfunction royal family, this story is very intriguing in its subtle layers and sophistication. Adapting his own play, screenwriter James Goldman does a lot of justice to the layering and intelligence, keeping color going, in spite of an overt reliance on chit-chat, with outstanding dialogue whose humor biting, and whose expository depth manages to do a plenty rich and organic job of fleshing out dynamic layers and rich characters, the backs of which might serve as a vehicle for dramatic resonance, should inspired direction be on board. Anthony Harvey, as director, delivers on some subdued dry spells, but manages to utilize tight scene structuring, combined with snappy writing, to establish adequate entertainment value, while plays on anything from John Barry's powerful, but underused score work, to deafening sobriety pierce with dramatic tension. At the very least, the sophistication of Harvey's storytelling is so respectable that one has be endeared towards the director's improvable, but tasteful efforts, which compel consistently in their engrossing you into the lives of richly drawn and even more richly portrayed characters. Most everyone has his or her time to shine, but not one shines quite like the leads, with Katharine Hepburn being intriguing and sometimes moving in her proper, yet humanly vulnerable portrayal of an intellectual and disrespected queen seeking some form of liberation from oppression, while Peter O'Toole once again nails Henry II's intensity as an ambitious king of great pride and great folly, whose gradual thickening shall emphasize his mortality. These and plenty of other major characters are a little sleazy, and it's hard to get invested in roles like that, especially when only so much acting material is offered, but if nuanced characterization doesn't make the leads enthralling, then their strong portrayals do, carrying an intimate drama whose aesthetic grace and sophisticated storytelling secure the reward value of this subtle, but striking affair.\r\n\r\nOnce winter has passed, the resonance of the film is a little chilled by conventions, questionable characters, melodramatics, often bland dragging, and, of course, natural shortcomings to a minimalist, yet promising story, whose value is complimented enough by immersive art direction, sharp writing, sophisticated direction and nuanced performances - especially from Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn - for Anthony Harvey's \"The Lion in Winter\" to stand as a subtly, but surely rewarding and intimate study on the personal affairs and conflicts of 12th-century English royals.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "The Lion in Winter attracted me solely on the basis of Peter O'Toole's acting talents, and essentially that is what kept me entertained all the way through.\n\nThe Lion in Winter had a Shakespearian feel to it, yet it transcended many of the usual story issues by having a fine touch of charming humour to go with it as it unveils its story about King Henry II and his challenges in life. It's like Shakespeare, but it has 3 elements that elevate it above Shakespearian cinema. One is that it has humour which is more obvious without having to research it for hours on end to find one joke, and yet the humour is subtle and effective. Another is that it's written in a comprehendible language with a strong script. And thirdly is that it doesn't completely suck. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I hate Shakespeare. But I didn't hate The Lion in Winter as it took the good elements of Shakespearian cinema and left the bad, save from a lot of talking and a rather slow pace.\nThe production design in The Lion in Winter is spot on as it makes the plot thoroughly convincing of the story's timeframe and setting, as do the costumes.\nAnd the cinematography is just excellent as it constantly manages to keep everything in perspective without too much movement or editing. Plus the locations The Lion in Winter is shot on prove beneficial.\nThe Lion in Winter receives thoroughly strong direction from Anthony Harvey, and under it the cast all manage to succeed and make an impact.\n\nPeter O'Toole is incredibly ferociously strong in The Lion in Winter and it's undoubtably one of his greatest performances. The power in his performance is laden with the kind of strength that Shakespearian actors could only dream about, because Peter O'Toole is so fierce and so powerful without going over the top that his intimidation as an actor has honestly never been stronger than it is in The Lion in Winter. His performance is so dominating that it's ridiculous that he wouldn't win the Academy Award for Best Actor, just as it is ridiculous that he was nominated for 8 in his lifetime without ever winning. Nevertheless he gives the greatest performance of the film and makes The Lion in Winter an unforgettable experience.\nI'd say that Katharine Hepburn gives one of her finest performances, but considering that practically every performance of hers is one of her best, it's safe to say that her performance in The Lion in Winter is terrific. She uses her same talented charisma as an actress and skill for confident line delivery that she always uses to charm audiences into giving her four Academy Awards, with The Lion in Winter being the third of them. Her chemistry with Peter O'Toole was also exceptional, since there was a real marital spirit to what they were conveying, and her character development as she gradually made more of an impact standing up to King Henry II as the story went on.\n\nAnthony Hopkins also gives one of the best supporting performances from early on in his career. He shows off the same dramatic passion and character dedication that would later win him an Academy Award and earn him such a respectful reputation. His charisma is strong and his talent at creating chemistry with other actors is rich. Anthony Hopkins is great to see working under Peter O'Toole as they are two of cinema's most celebrated male actors, and seeing them in the same film is quite the experience.\nTimothy Dalton supplies some strong talents from earlier on in his film career as well, and John Castle and Nigel Terry also did a fine job.\n\nSo The Lion in Winter is an incredibly well acted and visually strong story which has most of the good Shakespearian cinematic elements and few of the bad ones.",

He's an imposing force of nature here. At least Katharine Hepburn wasn't robbed, earning her 3rd Oscar (and 2nd in a row!). Watching the 2 of them banter back and forth is an absolute delight. The scorn and vile remarks that drip from each tongue just spit acid and hate, yet you see how there's something there that keeps them from truly destroying each other. Also shocking is just how funny some of the dialogue is here, especially from a film that's nearly 45yrs old. Add to that Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton in their first major screen roles, and you've got a spectacular cast who are all on fine form. What shocks me most about this, is that John Castle, as middle son Geoffrey didn't end up a bigger star. His scheming and sly behaviour and demeanor are just a blast to watch. You think you had a bad Christmas with the family recently? Ask Henry II how his was. Essential for anyone who says they are a film buff, or who actually likes great acting.",

Henry is fifty and all three want to inherit his throne, they all including his creepy wife devour each other on Christmas. I couldn't help thinking of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" while viewing this film, it can be considered a lesser, unintentional response to Mike Nichols' work. With the exception of one dialogue, this is one of the most unpredictable films I've seen; it's a war of words, a family drama set in a kingdom. Peter O'Toole shines most brightly; the scene where he is with King Philip II of France to discuss matters is not only the best of the movie, but showcases O'Toole's monstrous acting prowess to its peak and further. I don't think I really understood the point and intentions of its characters, the plot consists of a twist after a twist; it was really hard for me to distinguish humor from seriousness, so I think it's flawed. Maybe it's a better film than I am giving credit for, but then I am reminded of specific scenes where dramatic dialogues feel empty, sometimes I am put off by it, it seems like a frail exercise in who can say the most cleverly insulting sentence to another. I can't put this film all together in my head, and maybe this was the intention, I did enjoy it very much. It's an actor's delight.",

Anthony Hopkins' role as the young Richard the Lion-Hearted brings the jealousy and rage of the throne to this film. Also, the performances of John Castle and Nigel Terry are very good. The role played by Castle, Geoffrey, is witty and almost sarcastic in many ways. Terry's role as John is very good portrayal of the historical John I of England being whiny and insecure.

The argument ruins their relationships even more with each other, considering Henry wants his son John (Terry) to replace him, and his snake tongued wife Eleanor (Hepburn) wants their son Richard the Lionhearted to be King. \"The Lion in Winter\" is one of the best but forgotten films of the 1960's, and brings out some of the best performances in the tremendous cast-- ever. Directed by Anthony Harvey (who could never live up to the film afterwards), the movie takes a turn as one of the grandest and most stunning dysfunctional family movies of all time. Set in the 1300's, the film ends up being excellent both in set and costume design, and is just as good in the audio and video departments. But with those things aside, they don't even compare a little bit to the performances. This is one of the few films I've seen where every single leading actor could have received an Oscar. Hepburn tied with Barbara Streisand for \"Funny Girl\" at the ceremony later that year, and O'Toole was only nominated for what should have been a winning performance. Hopkins is great as well is his feature film debut, and the other sons played by Terry and Castle are just as powerful, and each of the cast members deliver the lines from the biting script perfectly. \"The Lion in Winter\" is one of those films that just makes you wonder why it's just not well-known. This is one of the finest movies ever made that just also might be the best performance by Katharine Hepburn in her entire career. Highly recommended.",

There were a few moments when, looking at Hepburn's world-weary, tear-stained face, I thought that it was bemoaning the ravages of age, and indeed, this is the best that I can come up with, but I can't understand how this theme interacts with the political plot.\nOverall, like the Stewart/Close version, Lion in Winter is fun to watch, and even though I hate Hepburn normally, I found her performance compelling here.",

Almost every turning point in this beautiful film is filled with seething anger and emotion, brimmed to the full with charades, schemes, ambition and wit that I simply have not up to now found in any other film. But it's not an eternal dispute; Henry also has the last say with his wife, played by Katherine Hepburn, as she is sailing back to \"jail\" - \"Do you think it's possible?\" (the \"it\" being a hope of never dying). In the end, The Lion In Winter patches up the epic struggle of ambition that constitutes the main elements within the plot, to a fragile peace and reconciliation. The best part of this film is that even though none of what happens in it has any historical basis, we FEEL that it would have happened anyway. This is of course in part due to James Goldman's play and script, but all the parts of this adaptation - O'Toole and Hepburn's performances (among others), John Barry's delightful music, Douglas Slocombe's breathtaking cinematography (especially true in the scene of Eleanor's arrival), and the very clever dialogue - are very harmoniously tuned under Anthony Harvey's direction. The Lion In Winter is a historical film unlike any other I've watched, and for anyone who watches it, the tempests, the clashes, and the debates will leave them no doubt that this is a uniquely enjoyable film. It's a must-watch for any epic/historical film fan.",

There's no swashbuckling here just scheming and haggling out short-lived truces. With wife vs. husband, brother vs. brother, mother vs. son and father vs son, the royals take pleasure in bringing up each others' personal failures whenever they're all gathered in a room - which is often. Henry II's affair with a younger woman, Richard I's affair with the King of France, past betrayals and the issue of who's going to marry who, who's going to be king and who's getting which parcel of land color this particular family's troubles but they manage to kiss and make up like all families do. Every line has a purpose and is infused with such wit and glamour, you follow ever word just not to miss anything. Hepburn and O'Toole outdo themselves and the actors who play their three sons aren't bad either. It is no wonder Hepburn won an Oscar for her role. I also appreciate how the film handled Richard being gay; too many people don't like to admit one of England's greatest kings was gay. All in all a stunning film that will stay with me for a long time.",

            "content": "A trenchant, incisive look into how the British royal family REALLY kept its power, The Lion in Winter lays bare all the foibles, flaws, infighting and fickle fidelity of the family of Henry II.  Peter O'Toole is unbelievable in his raw performance as the tired, hurt, tempestuous and arrogant King.  His performance is the other side of the coin to the treatment he gave the king in Becket.  Now that he's the star of the show, he tackles his role with even greater gusto than he showed four years earlier.  But he has to match wits with the great Katharine Hepburn who showcases the most varied range of emotions as Henry's distant, imprisoned wife.  Practically every line she spouts is full of mordant, acerbic wit; she gets most of the best lines in the film.  The back-and-forth between herself and her husband is the highlight of the movie, and their confrontations are filled with intelligence and emotional charge.  Their rows are laced with genuine hurt and antipathy, in a manner akin to Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.  The movie also boasts impressive incipient performances from Timothy Dalton and Anthony Hopkins, both of whom match the intensity and impetuousness required of their callow characters.  The whole of the cast is perfectly realized, and the momentousness of the situation -- how best to steer England while serving their own selfish needs -- is given a particular slant based on each character.  John Barry's sinister, dolorous music does well in matching the film's tone and raising the emotional stakes even more.  The script is crackling with wit and intelligence, and it is blessedly realized by the smart performances who give this film the pulse and pressure it needs.  The story is marvelously constructed with give-and-take, backstabbing, and plotting galore.  It's a morbid bit of fun and an Anglophile's dream.  Just don't ask me how much of it actually happened.",

            "content": "The Lion In Winter takes place in 1183 during the reign of Henry II (grandson of William The Conqueror), King of England.  The film focuses on the political intrigue and emotional backstabbing between Henry, his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine and their three sons, Richard, Geoffrey, and John.  To say dysfunctional family is an understatement.\r\n\r\nThe factual back story goes like this: 30 years earlier, Henry solidified and increased his father's holdings, to become a true king of England (including Scotland, Wales and Ireland).  He then conquered key territories in France, which forced King Louis to have his marriage to Eleanor annulled so that Henry could then marry her and control her rich lands, the Aquitaine.  Henry and Eleanor produced four sons, and it was assumed that while the oldest (another Henry) would become king, Henry's empire would be split between all four sons (Richard getting the Aquitaine from his mother, John getting Brittany, etc.).\r\nThis didn't sit well with any of the siblings, and in 1170 Richard (upon advice from his mother Eleanor) led a revolt against his father.  When the insurrection was quelled, Richard retreated to France where he became friends with the young regent in waiting, Philippe, while Eleanor was imprisoned for her treasons against Henry.\r\n\r\nAll would have been well except the heir (Henry the Younger) died shortly before the film takes place, leaving Henry with a Hobson's choice between Richard who had already betrayed him, Geoffrey, a heartless manipulator but a coward in battle (something that just wasn't \"kingly\" in the early middle ages), and John, a weak willed bumbler who was, by default, Henry's favorite.\r\n\r\nSo, with this important back-story out of the way, let's move on to the film, produced in 1968 and nominated for an Oscar (but losing to the musical Oliver!).  The film may seem a bit dated now, especially as some of the editing could have been better, but it excelled in its use of camera perspective and realism.  Before this film, movies about knights and castles were very homogenized, the castles all sparkly clean and majestic.  Here, director Anthony Harvey attempts to give a truer representation of the era; the castle a dank pile of stone with little adornment, while the courtyard was filled with chickens and dogs running rampant.  \r\n\r\nSimilarly, there is a battle scene in the early part of the film that is shot at medium distance and basically portrays the chaos of battle.  It comes off a bit stilted especially by today's standards, but again, the attempt at realism is apparent; as is a much later fight scene between two mailed knights, clumsy in their movements due to the weight of all the metal they were wearing.\r\n\r\nThe script attempts the Herculean task of giving a history lesson while at the same time telling a compelling story of its own.  The script succeeds in spades, even while falling (perhaps intentionally) into an almost Shakespearian tone, including soliloquies and a scene involving eavesdropping behind wall hangings.\r\n\r\nThat this all succeeds is directly the result of some of the finest acting to hit the big screen.  Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole sizzle and command your attention in every scene.  Kate won the Oscar for her portrayal of Eleanor (in Oscar's only tie, along with Streisand for Funny Girl) and is truly a marvel, easily moving from acerbic to genteel and back again - portraying a truly complex woman for the ages.  \r\n\r\nO'Toole was nominated as well, and in a continuing trend of Oscar disconnect, did not win, losing to Cliff Robertson (who admittedly was wonderful in Charly). O'Toole is full of energy and bluster, but still manages to convey that he is portraying a man of 50 (which is quite advanced for 1183).  He bellows and schemes, at one point uttering the lovely line that Mel Brooks riffed on in History of The World: \"it's good to be the king\".\r\nAfter bellowing at young Philippe of France (a deep and wonderfully nuanced performance by a young Timothy Dalton (yep, James Bond), O'Toole schools the boy in statesmanship by saying \"boy, when I bellow, you're supposed to bellow back\".\r\n\r\nThere are a million other noteworthy lines, as when, tired of bickering, O'Toole asks Hepburn to grant him a little rest, to which she replies \"I would be happy to grant you eternal rest, my liege\".\r\n\r\nFinally there are some wonderful scenes between Hepburn and her favored son Richard (say hello to Anthony Hopkins, who manages to hold his own opposite Kate), full of plotting and conniving, and hinting at something deeper than a typical mother/son relationship.  The film also dares to openly discuss a gay relationship between two of the characters, instead of using innuendo.\r\n\r\nThere are of course some scenes that fail, either for being overly melodramatic, or due to the theatrical nature that the film was couched in, but regardless, there is plenty of meat on these bones, and, if nothing more than a testament to the incredible talents of Hepburn and O'Toole, this film withstands the test of time.",

It isn't a factual account of what went on during that time, it's pure fiction but boy is it a joy to watch. The amazingly talented actors give some of their best performances on screen. By the way this cast I am referring to included both Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn in Oscar nominated and winning roles, respectively, plus it was also the screen debut for both Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton. Dalton is quite and Anthony Hopkins was robbed of an Oscar nomination as he gives one of the best performances in a debut as Richard the Lion-Hearted. But it is O'Toole and Hepburn and all the insults they constantly throw at each other that make this a great cinematic experience. I really wanna give it a full 5 stars, maybe another viewing in the future will increase the rating. Highly recommended viewing. 9/10",

His three sons however each have their pros and cons but none of them is strictly speaking a favor for the throne. Throw into the mix the devious Queen, played by K.Hepburn, and the mix is set. \n\nThe whole movie can be descibed as a giant big melodramatic web of schemes and backstabbings where each main character plays a never ending power game for the English throne. This generates an entertaining athmosphere of deception and plotting where each character can no longer tell who is cincere and who is not. The game has gone on for so long that none of the characters can stop it even if they wanted to. \n\nBeing more of a theaterical act, the movie naturally rests heavily on the shoulders of the actors who certainly do not dissapoint. Each actor portrays their characters in a very convincing and lively manner. The crown of acting is taken by P.O'Toole without any questions who pulls a magnificent role as the paranoid king. The other actors are close on the kings heels so to speak, the young A.Hopkins already shows his skill as one of the princes and other main actors give better than average performances. \n\nThe movie could have been a tad shorter, the back and forth scheming grows somewhat tiring towards the end. Clearly the movie is not for everyone, but if one enjoys a good theaterical act and do not mind the somewhat over the top acting the Lion in Winter surely will not disappoint.",

King Henry II's three sons each covet being next-to-the-throne (even the pimply/whiney youngest John) - while the four other key players - Henry, the Queen, visiting King Philip of France and Henry's mistress Alais - each have their own schemes for succession. \n\nAccordingly, the plot's drenched in deceit, double-crossing, betrayal and insincere words. Unfortunately, each player changes his/her mind regarding his/her own plan about every 30 seconds, to the point where the entire plotline becomes totally unbelievable. \n\nThe top-billed deliveries here by Peter O'Toole (as Henry) and Katherine Hepburn (as his Oscar-winning Queen) are the strongest facet of the film. One might suspect that the better-known, Shakespearian theater-bred Anthony Hopkins (as Richard the Lionhearted, the eldest son) and Timothy Dalton (as Philip), here in their screen debuts, drive the supporting performances. But it's actually Royal Academy-trained Jane Merrow, as ingenue-like yet subtly clever and conniving Alais, who's far more interesting to watch. \n\nNo history lesson here; this is actually fictional work wrapped around historical figures and draws ever-so loosely on factual events. \n\nDialogue is sometimes satisfyingly sharp, but more often seems merely pretentious. \n\nPanavision/EastmanColor. The costuming, cinematography and color are all adequate, but there's zero resto work here, so expect spackle consistent with age. \n\nRECOMMENDATION: See the other three films first, before spending any time with this one.",

More than two hours of just talking begins to feel like a bit much, particularly when the story starts to tread water a bit.  And after all the buildup, the climax feels disappointing to me.  Still, all that doesn't erase the fact that the actors are all in fine form here, and they are given some fantastic and wicked dialogue to spew.  The strength of the love-hate relationship between the audience and both Henry and Eleanor actually almost leads me to agree with those closing lines: \"I hope we never die.\"  ... Almost.",

A very strong performance by Katherine Hepburn, not the best performance of the year, that belongs Barbara Streisand, hands down. Not a tie, as was presented at the Oscars.",

He is attended by his wife Eleanor (Katherine Hepburn) of Aquitaine (released from her imprisonment for the holidays) and his sons; Richard (Anthony Hopkins) the future King Richard the Lionheart, Geoffrey and John (Nigel Terry) later King but best known to most as Prince John as well as Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mistress Alais and King Phillip II (Timothy Dalton) of France. While attempting to maintain a veneer of family and friends the various characters constantly scheme and plot both with and against one another jockeying for favor and position.\r\n\r\nWhile the film has exceptional production values the principal enjoyment comes from the performances and the writing. All of the principles engage in numerous discusions with one another that are layered with both meaning and subtext.\r\n\r\nWhile the protagonists are actual historical figures, the film covers a fictional gathering. The internecine struggles amongst the family are well documented and the discussions and confrontations depicted here may have happened elsewhere and at different times have been distilled here for story telling purposes.\r\n\r\nThe film was directed Anthony Harvey for whom this would be his career high point as a director, though he also had considerable success as an editor on some very good films. The wonderful score by John Barry would win him one of his 5 Oscars.\r\n\r\nThe film would win three Academy Awards for Best Actress \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Katherine Hepburn, Best Screenplay and Best Score. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Peter O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Toole and Best Costume Design.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hepburn was 25 years O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Toole\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior and its somewhat apparent if you look for it, they are both so effective in their performances that its a non issue.",

It is truly sad to know that Peter O'Toole did not get the Oscar for his performance as Henry II - he dominates a film filled with strong acting. It is fun to see Katherine Hepburn acting naughty. A young Anthony Hopkins and future 007 Timothy Dalton are excellent in supporting roles. Anthony Harvey directs with great gusto. A fantastic film that kept me interested.",

In a movie featuring knights, princes and kings clad in chainmail and armed with broadswords, there is nearly no action.

They throw no barbs without clever calculation.  \r\n\r\nIt's stunning the infighting that monopolizes a family with so much might.  They are the most powerful people in their realm, and without temporal affairs to worry them, their days are ruled by plotting and scheming.\r\n\r\nThis film made me wonder if a similar dynamic exists within the families  of modern day royalty, the Kennedys, Bushes, or the sitting British monarchy.\r\n\r\nFantastic film.  9/10.",
