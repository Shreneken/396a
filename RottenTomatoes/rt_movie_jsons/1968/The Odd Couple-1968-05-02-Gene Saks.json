            "content": "This is a fairly amusing comedy film from the 1960s. It is perhaps a bit un PC or stereotyped these days, in that it covers the risk of suicide from a guy who's marriage has just broken down but the awkward comedy did appeal to me never the less. The humour is pretty juvenile in nature but I didn't mind that too much. There's plenty of fast paced dialogue and some fairly memorable moments. The men are somewhat curmudgeonly and the ladies (well, some of them) somewhat 'dolly bird'-ish but I enjoyed the film and thought it was entertaining never the less. I wouldn't like to make fun of someone who was recently divorced but the comedy does come from other plot details - mainly the fact the 2 men have to share the same flat/apartment. The situations they find themselves in and how they defend their actions made me chuckle quite a bit. This isn't what I'd call a great film but its certainly good enough to be worth a watch - it has a bit of a farce type feel to it and I wasn't surprised its based on a play (by Neil Simon), as I did think it came across as a film that would be easy to stage as a play or theatrical production.\n\nAs I say, yes, I'd recommend this film.",

            "content": "\"YOU ASKED FOR IT. YOU'RE A WONDERFUL GUY, OSCAR.\"\n\nOne of the most well-known and successful comedies of the partnership between Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, The Odd Couple isn't as fast-paced as modern examples of the genre tend to be (and slower than the screwballs that preceded it) and requires a bit of adjusting as a result, but is suprisingly wholesome and entertaining for a buddy film that uses a collapsing marriage and a suicide attempt as its starting bell. The balance between Lemmon's jittery high-strung energy and Matthau's heavily accented sluggishness is still a winner, pairing well with their husband/wife roleplaying that you can manage would have been more endearing as a comedy of manners in the conservative '60s. The ending is pretty anticlimactic all things considered, but this is still a solid film despite showing some of its age. And at $1.50/hour, Lemmon's deep-cleaning services are a bargain. \n\nAs a side note, this might be the earliest film I can recall with an end-credits gag, intentionally mixing up and 'correcting' the actresses of the identical twin sisters that take in Felix in his hour of need. (3.5/5)",

However, beyond a few smile-inducing exchanges and a couple of clever sight gags, I just simply didn't find this to be all that funny. This isn't to say that the material at hand is chock-full of swings and misses or offensive subject matter or anything. I guess what I'm saying is, no one told me that this was more of a dramedy than a straight-up, straight-laced comedy. Indeed, Lemmon and Matthau are fun to watch together, with their onscreen chemistry comprising the key factor of enjoyment for me. There's just not really that much else here for my comedic tastes. Killer theme song, though.",

            "content": "Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are comedy legends. While the concept of The Odd Couple was solid on its own, I\u2019m still not convinced it would have been as much of a cultural phenomenon (even to the point of inspiring TV spin-offs and a movie sequel) if not for the talent of the two lead actors. These guys elevate the material to greatness because they have a perfect handle on the characters, and have great chemistry with one another. Matthau in particular was born to play the irascible slob who can\u2019t put up with a lovelorn neat freak. Somehow he makes being aggravated hilarious, and normally I\u2019d be annoyed by a likable guy dealing with constant frustration (it\u2019s one of my least favorite plot devices in film.) The other actors in the film are also delightful, particularly Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the ditzy girls next door. One of the problems I have with The Odd Couple (and this isn\u2019t a flaw in the film, just a personal issue) is that the plot is lackluster and needed more going on. But I\u2019m convinced it only felt that way to me because I saw many episodes of both the original TV series and the recent remake. Having all that familiarity with these characters before made this film feel like an extended episode of the show, instead of something wholly original. I know this isn\u2019t the movie\u2019s fault, since it came out before all of that other stuff, but when the movie was ending I couldn\u2019t believe that was all we got for a story (a lot of things I already knew and not much resolution.) I still enjoyed the way the plot was presented, and the confrontations between Oscar and Felix are great in this version, I think I was just expecting something more. Along with the cast, the dialogue makes The Odd Couple shine. It was obvious early in the film that this script was witty and smart. It doesn\u2019t settle for a bunch of slapstick or crude jokes, instead it has people delivering lines that are actually written funny. I sometimes wonder if they should have made Oscar a bit more of an obnoxious slob, though. For most of the movie it seems like Felix is always in the wrong. He\u2019s the one overreacting, he\u2019s the one who can\u2019t stop nagging, he\u2019s the one who obsesses over every little detail, so it feels natural to assume he\u2019s the antagonist. I think the dynamic of the film would be a bit stronger if both guys were annoying, so they are both right and wrong at the same time. That being said, I forgave a lot with The Odd Couple because it made me laugh several times, plus Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are nearly perfect in every single scene.

I seem to remember reading that Billy Wilder was approach to write and direct the film adaptation of the Neil Simon play, and I am convinced that film would have been a classic. Instead, this story that answers the question, can two divorced men share an apartment without driving each other crazy? Wilder apparently did not take part in this film over the studio not wanting to pay his salary, but his touch of madcap comedy and sentimentality is what this film really needed. Neil Simon adapted his own play for the screen, but the film does still feel stagey and the film seemed oddly paced. Despite it's faults, Matthau and Lemmon shine and do make this film something of a minor classic.",

            "content": "Starring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. If you don't know the story, then you're culturally illiterate. But this is the definitive film version of Neil Simon's story of two mismatched New Yorkers who share an apartment. Lemmon and Matthau, who were friends in real life, are simply one of the great screen comedy teams and their byplay is delightful to see. This was the second of ten films they made together between 1966's \"The Fortune Cookie\" and 1998's ill-fated \"The Odd Couple II\". Directed by Gene Saks, who does a good job opening up the confined apartment of the stage production.",

The story is an interesting one be chase of how different the two are from each other and how they slowly get more frustrated. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau play good opposites of each other and I thought they really pulled off good performances. There wasn't any way that I could get mad at the characters when they fought because they are simply just different people and that's understandable. The side characters were fun like the poker group and the pigeon twins even though they were a bit annoying at times. Their fights were pretty funny and enjoyable but as the movie got towards the end it got kinda bitter. I thought maybe that it was the falling action after their main argument. It never really did get any chipper than the first 3/4s of the movie. The ending was kinda bittersweet the way they joked with each other but I just wanted a bit of a happier ending. The Odd Couple was a funny dramedy. Lemmon and Matthau were great and had good chemistry. The ending was a bit of a disappointment but I liked the first half a lot. B",
