I didn't love the ambiguous ending but i was captivated & entertained the rest of the film.\u00a0\u2028\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f",

It is incredibly drawling, though the look and story for its time is beyond impressive.

            "content": "Although it raises far more questions than it bothers to answer, Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is a visual and technical marvel from beginning to end. Anything I could say about this movie has most likely already been said. Although one thing I wanted to mention was that 2001 is 149 minutes long and yet 88 minutes of the thing are dialogue-free, which in itself is both pretty ballsy and utterly magnificent in letting visuals tell a story, a story with plenty of holes but many opportunities for answers.\n\nEqual amounts optimistic as it is harrowing, 2001 is pure brilliance that blurs that line between science fiction and scientific reality; an unforgettable endeavour into the realms of space, humanity and beyond. Putting it bluntly, 2001 is genre-defining for a reason.",
