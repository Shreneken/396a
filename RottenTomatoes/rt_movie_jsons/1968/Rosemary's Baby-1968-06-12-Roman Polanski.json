    "summary": "A young wife comes to believe that her offspring is not of this world. Waifish Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move to a New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and odd neighbors Roman and Minnie Castavet (Sidney Blackmer, Ruth Gordon). When Rosemary becomes pregnant she becomes increasingly isolated, and the diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth.",

The fake bats in Dracula and The House on Haunted Hill are more terrifying. Belongs in the same category as Citizen Kane: overpraised movies because at one point they were revolutionary. However, at least Kane was entertaining on the first watch unlike this Baby tripe.",

            "content": "Altho' many have said the movie is dated, I will still say that \"Rosemarys Baby\" is THE classic when it comes to old school \"Devil\" horror. \nNewer horror films heavily use jumpscare & gross-out to get the viewer, but \"RB\" depends upon that slow-burn build up of paranoia, a growing pit-of-your-belly sense of 'something isn't right'... truly \"horror\" rather than the \"terror\" of trying to throw a sudden scare that terrifys you out of your socks for that 3-second adrenaline rush! \nIf you have the desire to read up on the films backstage stories, there are several, including one that relates that many of the actors in one scene felt *very* uncomfortable saying the line, \"Hail Satan!\" and wouldn't do it. \nOverall, the acting was superb. Special Kudos to Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon, Farrow for the complete terror & paranoia, Gordon for the oh-so-sweet Little Old Lady who was really the Satanic Priestess in Disguise! \nDon't let the lack of special effects fool you, don't let the slow burn put off rather than wanting the sudden frights and gross make-up effects. Truly, \"Rosemarys Baby\" is THE classic \"Devil\" film! \n\nAnd the ending? In its own way, probably the most powerful part of the film ðŸ˜‰",

Mia farrow talks like she is British for some reason even though it takes place in the US and watching these old movies, I think it's just how people talked at that time. Not a fan. In the end I'm not a fan. The idea that her husband joined a cult. She should've went in a taxi to her parents or something but she was caught so easily. She could've got away, I bet it was easier back then compared to now, you know cell phones. Anyway I can't believe this movie sucks, very disappointing.",

There are so many movies from this era that I absolutely adore. Rosemary's Baby is just...bad. \n\nMia Farrow does a fabulous job with what she was given, and I will never discredit her acting in this. Unfortunately the main character is written as unlikable and idiotic, the rest of the cast is phoning it in, Polanski has no subtlety or shame throwing in an assault without actually addressing it (though with his past, that's very on brand for him), and the \"twist\" at the end is barely a twist at all. Does Rosemary think it's surprising? Sure. But if anyone else was surprised that the baby was the antichrist even when this first came out, clearly they were not actually watching the movie. \n\nNot that I blame them, they probably made the right choice.",

There are secret doors and crazy drugs and sects but it is all underplayed so that it is not scary, creepy or has suspense. For shame! Even The Omen (1976) executes the idea better.

It features a story of a woman and her husband who get pregnant but are threatened by diabolical forces. Mia Farrow stars as the titular character as a young beautiful and ingenious woman. Along with John Cassevetes they portrayed a beautiful couple with incredible chemistry that shows how much they love each other. Ruth Gordon does an academy award winning performance as a nosy eccentric old lady that becomes involved in the couples life changing their lives forever. But is Polanski's incredible directing with extreme close ups, a sense of claustrophobia and paranoia, catholic symbolism, and suspense building that makes this movie such a work of art. A few weaknesses are the very slow set up that takes too long and the ending which is unconventional. However, I cannot deny its greatness.",

However, no amount of technical prowess brought by writer/director Roman Polanski and company can overcome the film's lack of suspense and emotional impact. This very well-appointed B movie takes itself just a little too seriously to adequately embrace the highly exploitive and silly premise on which it is based. In order to merit its current inclusion amongst the greatest horror movies of all time, Rosemary's Baby would need to actually be scary-which it's not. The idea of the story certainly has the potential to be frightening: being betrayed, gaslit, raped by Lucifer, then used as a satanic cult's surrogate. Yet without any of the truly shocking moments or overwhelming sense of dread contained in similarly acclaimed icons like The Exorcist, Alien, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or The Shining, all audiences are left with is a malevolent and expertly crafted melodrama.",

            "content": "Richard Sylbert, the production designer on \"Rosemary's Baby\", called it \"the greatest horror film without any horror in it.\" Mia Farrow plays Rosemary Woodhouse, a hip young NYC wife to actor Guy Woodhouse, played by the talented John Cassavetes. When she becomes pregnant, Rosemary starts to suspect a conspiracy that her nosy old neighbors, Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, are the leaders of a coven of modern day witches seeking to do harm to her unborn child. Is she right? Is losing her mind? The brilliance of \"Rosemary's Baby\" is that it convincingly plays both sides of that coin, the same way Henry James did with \"Turn of the Screw\" or Robert Wise in his film \"The Haunting\", right up until the very end. Writer/director Roman Polanski crafts a disturbingly paranoid film that is reminiscent of his earlier film \"Repulsion\" and a later film of his in which Polanski himself starred, \"The Tenant.\" All three of these film are stories form an interesting trilogy of isolation and madness in modern metropolitan apartments. I've always thought the Coen Brothers' \"Barton Fink\" was something of a homage to these Polanski films. Interestingly, Fink won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, the same year Polanski was the head of the jury that awarded them the prize. Polanski brings a strong visual style and atmosphere to the film that is at once very slick and contemporary, but also hints at classic gothic horror. While he delivers a few showy sequences, such a memorable surreal dream sequence early in the film, the more subtle touches he brings to the film are make it such a unique classic. For example, one moment early in the film when Rosemary and Guy tour their future apartment (led by the always great Elisha Cook Jr.), Rosemary notices there's a door being a large dresser. The camera almost imperceptibly pans upward as Rosemary and Guy stand on tip toes to peek over the dresser, which causes the audience to seemingly discover this hidden door with the characters. Another great moment isn't a visual one, but a moment sucks the audience in none-the-less, is when Rosemary thinks she hears something happening in the next apartment and turns off the air conditioning, which the viewer never even noticed among the many other city noises, but this subtle sound design moment is another example of Polanski using cinematic techniques to draw the audience into the story and into these characters heads. This becomes even more intense when we're drawn into these characters beginning to lose their minds. Featuring an unsettling lullaby themed score by Krzysztof Komeda, lush and hypnotic photography by William A. Fraker that is at once bright and modern and also darkly gothic, and a stellar cast that also includes Maurice Evans as Rosemary's father figure friend Hutch, Ralph Bellamy as her obstetrician Dr. Sapirstein, Charles Grodin as Dr. Hill, and you even have D'Urville Martin, the director and co-star of \"Dolomite\", as an elevator operator. And look fast for producer William Castle in a cameo as a man on the phone and in another scene, and listen for an unbilled Tony Curtis as the voice on the other end of a phone call for the unseen but significant character Donald Baumgart. For those who aren't familiar with producer William Castle, he was famous for making schlocky horror films like \"The House on Haunted Hill\" or \"The Tingler\" and featured gimmicks such as selling life insurance policies in the theater lobby in case audience members died of fright or another where he put joy buzzers under theater seats to terrify the audience. Castle's brand of horror movies were the antithesis of the smart horror film that \"Rosemary's Baby\" represents. Castle mortgaged his home in order to buy the rights to Ira Levin's novel in hopes of finally directing a quality film, but studio head Robert Evans (\"Love Story\" \"The Godfather\" \"Chinatown\") insisted on hiring Polanski to direct the film. Overall, this is a perfect horror film that taps modern world insolation and paranoia in a way that makes old world horrors seem plausible. FUN FACT! \"Rosemary's Baby\" is reportedly one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films and \"The Shining\" star Jack Nicholson was suggested to Roman Polanski by producer Robert Evans, but Polanski felt that \"for all his talent, his slightly sinister appearance ruled him out\". That insight was Stephen King's major criticism of the Kubrick adaptation of \"The Shining\", that no one's dad looks like Jack Nicholson and that he was clearly off-kilter and crazy from the start of the film.",

            "content": "A haunting depiction of a woman powerless against her tormentors.\n\nRosemary's Baby (1968) is an iconic, influential, and unnerving horror film brilliantly directed by infamous child rapist Roman Polanski. Rosemary's Baby takes you on a psychological Satanic journey into a dark drama about the fear of motherhood like no other. I can only compare it to films Polanski's Rosemary's Baby has profoundly influenced such as The Omen, Suspiria, The Shining, Sophie's Choice, The Babadook, The Witch, or Hereditary. Polanski ensures you are lulled into his horror story with dreamy direction and alluring 1960's mod fashion. From the hypnotizing opening theme with Mia Farrow humming the melody to the numerous dream sequences, Rosemary's Baby forces you to witness a woman's agony with no agency of her own. \n\nMia Farrow's lead actress performance as Rosemary Woodhouse is a powerful display of fear, suspicion, curiosity, eagerness, innocence, devastation, dread, anxiety, disappointment, desperation, compassion, and paranoia. Farrow captures all these emotional states with ease in a natural performance that is deeply empathetic, sympathetic, and endearing. She's so lovely and sweet that her innocent naive personality make for a more poignant victim. She soft voice, pale skin, short blonde hair, tiny figure, and gentle nature elevate Farrow's dramatic performance into the stuff of legends. She delivers an absolute frightened in Rosemary's Baby.\n\nJohn Cassavetes is tremendously entertaining as Guy Woodhouse. His charming, loving husband persona falls away into an overbearing, controlling, and gaslighting spouse into something much darker. His subtle acting starts out so warm and likable into a fearsome antagonist. Ruth Gordon's nosey neighbor Minnie Castevet is so infuriatingly stubborn, disquietingly intrusive, yet hilariously abrasive that you cannot help but be impressed by Gordon's acting. Sidney Blackmer is all charm and understatement with his threats as Roman Castevet. Ralph Bellamy is insistent and provocative as Dr. Sapirstein.\n\nI liked Maurice Evans as the helpful and kindly Hutch. Charles Grodin is deceptively nurturing as the important Dr. Hill. It's neat seeing Grodin in a serious horror film as I normally associate him with comedies. They both play their supporting characters with a serious attitude that accents the foreboding nature of Rosemary's Baby. Polanski's script constantly gifts you with ominous signs and foreboding setups that deliver clever payoffs by the end. His astute writing is elevated by several outstanding acting performances from his talented cast.\n\nI should mention that Rosemary's Baby features some of the most engaging, intriguing, and inventive editing ever. Sam O'Steen and Bob Wyman's editing choices are fascinating. The clever jump cuts as characters just start to interact with objects make for striking transitions between scenes. Meanwhile, their smooth and seamless montages for Rosemary's dream sequences are the most frightening scenes in Rosemary's Baby. They take at least 5 scenes and perfectly splice them together to convey Rosemary's past and present in a haze of salient images. Once you figure out what these dream sequences mean, you realize what geniuses O'Steen, Wyman, and Polanski are for such careful filmmaking. \n\nOverall, Rosemary's Baby will pound you with a sense of dread and helplessness as you are chilled by a haunting horror tale. The Satanic rituals and infant finale are the stuff of nightmares. Rosemary's Baby is genuinely scary, so be forewarned.",

The neighbors, are cut and dry like sandpaper. It's dull and boring.

Yet in the next shot she is right beside them and doesn't do a thing.\n\nI do like classic horror films. I do a lot. But if you were to put this next to PSYCHO and you can compare them, I would laugh. PSYCHO made it frightening by showering in a motel. Rosemary's Baby tries to pressure you into seeing a crib to be horrifying with Satanism as a backdrop to the main story. I'll say it again. Do not watch this movie.

Babymaking is a beautiful and wonderful process that bonds two people together, and even if she hadn't been raped by the cult, how could her husband take that away from her by just doing it while she's asleep when they are trying to get her pregnant. What a sleazy and despicable way to look at sex. I can understand Rosemary's sentiment at the end of the film of loving her baby despite his Satan rape origins because a mother's love transcends any origin or physical attributes their baby may have, but the film seemed to have little point to it other than that all babies deserve love. It also has been said that the point of the film is the repression of women through pregnancy but I think of that as a load of crock. She was repressed because she had an a-hole husband and a coven that was at every door she tried to open, not just because she is a woman. If your network is limited and abusers are holding all the strings to your life you betcha it is difficult to get out, be you male or female. I guess that's another takeaway from the film, that it is difficult to escape an abusive relationship/support network. The scenes in this film were great because unlike conventional horrors there was little suspense through any part of the film, just a gnawing intuition that things weren't quite right or as they should be. By the end of the film it felt like it dragged a lot and I was a little disappointed by the ending, but it's not a bad movie and the cinematography is fantastic.",

            "content": "Depois de uma sÃ©rie de projetos no estrangeiro, entre os quais destaco o filme Repulsion(1965), o realizador e argumentista polaco Roman Polanski marca a sua primeira produÃ§Ã£o americana com o filme de terror psicolÃ³gico Rosemary's Baby. Adaptado fielmente do romance de terror do autor Ira Levin, o filme catapultou o realizador para o sucesso comercial, conquistando uma reputaÃ§Ã£o na industria cinematogrÃ¡fica que viria a confirmar com o tÃ­tulo Chinatown (1974) e mais tarde com The Pianist (2002).\n\nA histÃ³ria comeÃ§a com o casal Rosemary e Guy Woodhouse (Mia Farrow e John Cassavetes) a chegar ao seu novo apartamento em Manhattan. Os relatos do que se passou naquele apartamento comeÃ§am a inquietar Rosemary, que cedo comeÃ§a a experienciar coisas estranhas e desagradÃ¡veis. Guy fica encantado com os bizarros e metediÃ§os vizinhos, Roman e Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer e Ruth Gordon). Mas Ã© a gravidez de Rosemary que lhes chama realmente a atenÃ§Ã£o. Minnie comeÃ§a a cuidar da futura mÃ£e e dÃ¡-lhe uma bebida estranha para ajudar na gravidez. Rosemary, cada vez mais debilitada, entra em paranoia pela seguranÃ§a do seu feto.\n\nApesar da narrativa no seu nÃºcleo contar uma histÃ³ria de terror, Rosemary's Baby demarca-se pelos elementos dramÃ¡ticos que se articulam com nuances de humor negro. O enredo envolve uma multiplicidade de temÃ¡ticas: a submissÃ£o feminina, o poder patriarca, a influÃªncia da educaÃ§Ã£o conservadora cristÃ£ no subconsciente, a ambiÃ§Ã£o desmedida e o medo de perder o controlo da prÃ³pria vida. Polanski dramatiza todas estas vertentes, mas o que as torna sinistramente envolventes Ã© o facto do filme estar fundamentado na realidade. Por outras palavras, esta peÃ§a de ficÃ§Ã£o podia perfeitamente acontecer.\n\nA auxiliar a autenticidade da obra estÃ£o as tremendas prestaÃ§Ãµes dos atores em geral. Destaco desde jÃ¡ o papel de Minnie, que rendeu o Ã“scar de melhor atriz secundÃ¡ria a Ruth Gordon em 1969. A sua interpretaÃ§Ã£o caricata fez parecer que era incapaz de magoar uma mosca. Cassavetes, que interpreta um ator egocÃªntrico, tambÃ©m Ã© digno de nota, mas o filme pertence a Mia Farrow. No papel de Rosemary, a atriz representa um exemplo exÃ­mio de casting, especialmente no gÃ©nero do terror, ao vender a sua transformaÃ§Ã£o de boneca cintilante para uma dÃ©bil vÃ­tima. O filme evoluÃ­ com a personagem e, ainda que seja algo previsÃ­vel, Ã© um prazer acompanhar a sua jornada.\n\nNum plano mais tÃ©cnico, a direÃ§Ã£o de fotografia de William A. Fraker envolve imagens um pouco distorcidas e sequÃªncias longas que dÃ£o espaÃ§o aos atores para brilhar. AlÃ©m da qualidade no trabalho de cÃ¢mara, tambÃ©m o compositor Krzysztof Komeda utiliza a mÃºsica para evocar emoÃ§Ãµes cirÃºrgicas. O filme sofre, contudo, de alguma falta de ritmo, podendo ser retirados facilmente 10 a 15 minutos de modo a otimizar a experiÃªncia, que jÃ¡ Ã© de altÃ­ssima qualidade.\n\nDepois da surpresa do realizador George A. Romero com o filme Night of the Living Dead em 1968, nada fazia prever mais um clÃ¡ssico do gÃ©nero nesse mesmo ano. Atualmente, em 2018, o filme comemora 50 anos desde a sua estreia, e continuarÃ¡ certamente a ser analisado e admirado pelos fÃ£s da sÃ©tima arte. Rosemary's Baby Ã© o esquema mais macabro que Polanski conseguiu engendrar.\n\n9/10",

These are aspects I appreciate in any film, so I have to be up front about it and give this film some credit for succeeding on a technical level. Now that IÂ’ve softened the blow, IÂ’ll just say that I despised every other aspect of this film. It opens as one of the most boring movies IÂ’ve ever watched. While I knew what was coming and that there was some serious stuff behind the scenes, we donÂ’t see any of that so it is basically just a couple moving into a new apartment and making friends with the neighbors. Aside from a suicide which seems to impact no one for more than 30 seconds of screen time, the first act is tediously bland to the point where I was tempted to just fast-forward through everything.\n\nThen, in one of the most drastic tone shifts in film history, we get the joy of watching this ordinary nice woman being drugged, and then raped by a beast in some kind of drug-haze. This scene was enough to make me turn off the movie for awhile and question if it was worth watching any further. After some debate I soldiered on because this is a classic that a film fan should see in its entirety, right? Well, I was welcomed back into the film by a return to form as I watched another hour of boredom. Undoubtedly I was supposed to have chills or something because everything that is happening to her is so ominous, but it all seemed pretty mundane to me. Not only that. but it was ridiculously repetitive, because Rosemary just kept going back and forth between fear and trust. ItÂ’s not until the third act that finally we see light shed on some things.\n\nNow that things are being revealed, IÂ’m supposed to be caught up in RosemaryÂ’s panic and be wowed by all the pieces falling into place. But I already new the broad strokes of what was happening before I started the film so I just sat there annoyed that it took her so long to catch up with me. Now you can say that this film might have worked if it wasnÂ’t spoiled for me, but I canÂ’t imagine that is the case. It doesnÂ’t change how boring things are and how annoyingly repetitive most of it seems. IÂ’m not particularly a fan of horror anyways, and the horror films I like have tension that builds throughout. RosemaryÂ’s Baby never built tension for me, it just seemed to appear in bursts and then go away, and then IÂ’d spend long periods of time thinking Â“Get on with it!!Â” There wasnÂ’t much of anything that I found to enjoy in this entire film. It was a thoroughly frustrating experience to watch right up until the final frame. So, it might be a classic that some people find enthralling, but I thoroughly hated it.",

Oh yes, horror thrillers do not come much classier than this. 1968 and yet impressively still feels fresh when watching it for the first time today. It's one of those classic films that I think every film buff or cinephile or average movie fan should watch and I'm sure it's a popular choice when studying the medium of film. The story revolves around a young woman called Rosemary who moves into a new apartment with her husband. She wishes to conceive a baby, but when her obsessive neighbours become involved things start to take a turn into the realm of surrealism. A prime example of this, would be her \"dream\". She dreamt that she was being raped by Satan and that her neighbours and husband were watching as if it was a ritual. But of course we all know what actually happened (I shan't spoil it). It's a plot of mystery and intrigue. Roman Polanski's intelligent direction and screenplay was quite unique. We all knew what happened to Rosemary and we all knew what the end result was going to be, but we as the audience were interested in how Rosemary unravels the plot herself. This could've been a mystery with several twists and turns, but it's more than that. This was all focussed on her. Mia Farrow was excellent and easily held her own against the rest of the supporting cast. She exhumed innocence, fragility and transformed herself. I was impressed. Ruth Gordon won the Best Supporting actress award, I thought she was good but nothing outstanding. Although, she got that New York accent down to a tee! loved how we never saw what Rosemary's baby looked like, the imagery that is conjured up relies on the audience's imagination and I found that to be powerful. There were a few plot conveniences and I found the pacing to be inconsistent. A scene that oozed intrigue was then followed by a slower scene that seemed to negate everything that was before it. However, this is a solid classic horror film that, I'm sure, will never be forgotten.",

            "content": "Even from the beginning of the movie, there's this feeling of uneasiness that you can't quite put your finger on. You can especially feel this with the husband, played by John Cassavettes. He seems unsettled and uneasy, as if he knows something bad is going to happen soon, almost like a feeling of guilt coming from him. The way Polanski and the DP angled some of the shots helps give off this feeling, as well as the clever use of lighting projected on the actors faces.\n\nMia Farrow looks so pretty, real cute. She's almost like this beautiful innocent little flower that's going to be thrown down into this spiraling hell of a nightmare. So ominous those almost evil hellish chants they heard that one night coming from the neighbors apartment. And why does the old lady wear her makeup as if she was a clown? It's ridiculous looking. But in all honesty Ruth Gordon is so funny, she's such a character. Such a colorful and full of life personality. Bro, that whole scene with the brick layers and the nun and the little school children inside her apartment was so fucking trippy! WTF?! That was so fucking brilliantly done! Those dream sequences were so trippy and masterfully done. \n\nThe Castavets' apartment looks pretty ominous. Was Rosemary's Catholic upbringing tainted in a way? All these weird disorienting vignettes where she's on a boat in a dock and she's naked but then suddenly is wearing a bikini. Is she dreaming? Like wtf is going on? It definitely is the fucking late 60's with those trippy visuals. So fucking weird and fucked up how she was drugged with that mousse desert that Mrs. Castavet made so that the devil could have his way with her. And so twisted how they're using Rosemary as a surrogate to bring in the new spawn of Satan. So crazy how these weird old fucks are all in on it, making sure Rosemary delivers the baby, they're almost controlling her life and what she can and can't do. Well that's a fucking cult for ya. \n\nSo crazy to see Mia Farrow's transformation during her pregnancy scenes. She looks pale as a ghost and lost maybe 10 pounds. And that haircut ain't helping either lol. She looks super ill and fragile. Poor thing. So striking and scary how white her face is in some scenes. She looks like a corpse.\n\nIt's interesting watching the movie for a second time already knowing what's going to happen. It makes more sense why Guy (Cassavettes) acts the way he does, especially seeing his reaction when Rosemary tells him that she feels the baby moving and places his hand on her stomach. Not only is the baby not his, but he's also helping to bring in Satan's child. And he's putting her through all this so that he can move up in the acting business. Wow, the black crib was so ominous and creepy looking, fit for a little satan baby lol. \n\nBrilliant commentary on religion, pregnancy, cults and climbing up the ladder. Filled with paranoia and disorienting visuals that makes scenes seem eerie. Extremely smartly written and adapted from the book. Ominous and horrifying, spooky. It's like experiencing a waking nightmare. Darkly and surprisingly comical. And that hauntingly beautiful theme song that fits the mood of the movie perfectly. This is by far one of my favorite horror movies of all time. Truly twisted but such an amazing fucking movie and so masterfully and beautifully done.",

Despite these gripes of mine though the writing is still damn good, all the characters feel like real people, and an incredible amount of talent clearly went into making the film. It's just a shame that it's just merely good as it could've been great.\n\n8-/10",

It's very good and I loved it, but I didn't quite love it because of the horror elements. The horror actually comes off a bit tongue-in-cheek and campy at times. At least, the supernatural horror elements. The stuff with Mia Farrow being manipulated and controlled by those around her is definitely horrifying, but that doesn't quite help it reach the levels of one of the best horror movies ever. This movie is all about the strange performances and Mia Farrow's downplayed performance and vulnerable character. The ending is one of the best in the genre, even though it isn't quite satisfying for the audience. It doesn't quite reach Night of the Living Dead for a downer ending, but it's definitely not the happy ending (or maybe it is, depending on how you look at it). The only real complaint I have for this movie is that it's not a top ten (or even top twenty) horror movie. Top 50 for sure, but I always felt there were better representations of the genre. Still, that minor complaint out of the way, it's still an absolute classic movie.",

            "content": "A friend of mine described the style of the film as borderline comedic. Could I believe it, that Rosemary's Baby, one of the most famous Satanic horror films, is tongue-in-cheek? I can't say that I disagree, having seen the movie now. I felt internally blocked from laughing, since my expectations were too focused on the horror. Some of these scenes are sitcom-worthy. Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse (John Cassavetes and Mia Farrow) are moving into an apartment of a mysterious background. Guy is an actor looking for whatever gig he can get, while Rosemary is a lively housewife looking to raise a baby with him. Their relationship begins as flat-out adorable, in their sexual antics and the way that they mock awkward social interactions with landlords and neighbors. The most notorious neighbors in the complex are the elderly Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon). They nose around in Rosemary and Guy's apartment, and frequently invite themselves to whatever the two are doing. I shouldn't disrespect Roman. It's really Ruth Gordon as Minnie who annoys the living hell out of the audience and Rosemary -- no double entendre intended. Rosemary eventually gets pregnant, and during the pregnancy process, Guy grows colder and more distant.  The Castevets and their fellow old farts grow more overbearing, more so since Rosemary's doctor suggested that the Castevets supply a special medicinal drink for her. Complications in her pregnancy worry her old friends, but do not worry her new neighbors, the doctor, or even Guy. Sorry, are you wondering where the horror is?\n\nThe first forty minutes of the film feature practically no horror, as if there is nothing to worry about. For most movies, I would dismiss that as boring exposition. After a while, some of the interactions drag, and for that, I'll have to remove half-a-star for imperfection. Rosemary's Baby isn't only about telling a story though. It wants the audience to see the world from Rosemary's perspective, with the sole exception of a dream sequence around the forty minute mark. That dream sequence tells us all that we need to throw our sympathy towards Rosemary for the hour-and-a-half that is left. So for the first forty minutes, strange occurrences and coincidences are peculiar, but nothing more. After the dream, we are as paranoid and unnerved as Rosemary soon becomes. More unnerving is how the meat of the horror only surfaces in that dream. Past that, it's all about picking up context clues and allowing them to crawl under your skin. Subtlety does not always make for good cinema. Director Roman Polanski does what he wants though -- really, no double entendre intended. By revealing the horror early in the film, we, the audience, won't be wondering whether or not Rosemary is a conspicuous nutcase. We know what is real, in the realm of the story, and we long for the survival of apartment-bound Rosemary. Mia Farrow is mighty devoted to surviving, when threatened. You can see her trust in someone leave her whole body at a heartbeat. A-plus for her. The most disturbing moment may be the very end. We root for Rosemary, despite knowing from the dream that her goal in mothering her baby is unattainable. Upon finding out why she can't achieve this, she mothers the baby anyway. Rarely is an action both defiant and submissive. Brilliant acting, directing, and writing, all around.",

It's not horror in the way we see it today - there's not a single jump scare, or any gore - but there are lots of dark themes and trippy dream sequences filled with hellish dark romanticism. The director and cinematography are slow and subtle, allowing events to unfold as if they are every day life, and we never feel like we're being manipulated even though we certainly are. It's the kind of film that makes you think you're on top of things, before building up to another surprise that's really been right there in front of you to decipher the whole time. The best part about Rosemary's Baby is that we never leave Rosemary, and aren't given any clues that she herself isn't given to figure out just what the hell is going on. It's a tense, eerie mystery/thriller that's constantly surprising without being in-your-face and screaming \"ha-ha! did you see that?!\" Easily one of the top 5 horror films I've ever seen, though it's really a film that transcends genre.",

What fuels this movie to great success is the wonderful cast, insane story, pure thrills, and its memorable twist. The story follows a newlywed couple that is moving into the city to find a closer apartment for Guy's work. In their apartment they meet with their neighbors, Roman and Minnie who act a bit strange and when Rosemary is impregnated things get crazy. Mainly what makes this movie so intense and sinister is the performance by Mia Farrow. Anytime throughout the film you can look at Rosemary and see pure emotion put into her facial features and body movements. She was fantastic! The supporting cast was really great too! The neighbors, guy, the two doctors... They all gave memorable performances. What I love about this movie is that there's always this lurking sense of darkness in every scene. Even in the beginning when they are getting a tour of the apartment there's a huge amount eeriness that swept over me. I always felt suspense when it existed and there was never a time where I thought something was stupid or didn't work. This movie can potentially give someone serious chills too, anyone who is pregnant probably shouldn't watch this at the moment. It's not all just scary scary, there's real life scares in here too like getting pregnant. Rosemary didn't feel totally normal all the time and felt significant pain which can be disturbing to a lot of viewers. This story also plays tricks on my mind, what I thought was all imagination really wasn't and that was really clever. It convinced me that you can be clever in a way where it makes you think something's going a certain way and then the writers are like \"nah you were right from the beginning\" and that's really neat! Everything about this film screams horror to me, the setting, the tone, the acting, the music, even the way the film is shot. It's perfect setup for a great film. While I really enjoyed Rosemary's Baby there was just a bit much of an underlying heartless tone that kinda threw me off for a few minutes in the last scene. Otherwise, this film is a total classic that has a fantastic lead performance and a really cool story. A-",

            "content": "Said to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, Rosemary's Baby sounded like both a classic and another great chance to look into Roman Polanski's work.\n\nRosemary's Baby has the subject matter to appeal to a wide range of viewers. The source of the horror in the story comes from the protagonist's fears, both as a vulnerable woman and a pregnant mother which means that it works as both a legitimate and touching drama as well as being a horror film with a gradually burning atmosphere. The horror in the film may be a little subtle for viewers of modern day, but those who have an appreciation for classical horror films are likely to love the film. I enjoyed it quite a lot, although I found it didn't have as much horror as I was expecting. It felt to me more like a drama with horror themes which gradually developed as the story progressed. But considering that was one of the standards for horror films of the time, and as a psychological horror film it did play out well on a human level. Rosemary's Baby is a film which is all about characters and atmosphere, and under the firm direction of Roman Polanski, it all does well.\nOn a very meagre budget of $3.2 million, Roman Polanski is able to take Rosemary's Baby to its maximum potential. He emphasises the human nature of the film by focusing mainly on the psychological distress that the titular Rosemary Woodhouse goes through, and he does it within the limited context of a single apartment building for the most of the film. This gives Rosemary's Baby a sense of claustrophobia as the protagonist becomes trapped in the confines of her building surrounded by people she cannot trust and embroiled in her own fears. The atmosphere and subtext of the film is great because predicting what comes next is challenging, and things always feel genuinely creepy. Roman Polanski's ability to establish an atmosphere in Rosemary's Baby is really great, and while it may not have the same effect today that it did back then and countless other imitations of Rosemary's Baby will leave it predictable, it still remains an effective film which is stylish, haunting and entertaining if a little slow and more about the drama of the main character than genuine horror.\nThe musical score in Rosemary's Baby is just excellent. It plays instantly as the film begins and the title credits roll which immediately sets the atmosphere for the film, and does not return until the final note of the film. It allows the horror and drama in Rosemary's Baby to all develop on its own\nAnd the cast of Rosemary's Baby help to put the atmosphere on the human level.\nMia Farrow's leading performance in Rosemary's Baby is just excellent. In definitely the finest dramatic performance of her career, Mia Farrow is easily able to put strong dramatic spirit into the role of Rosemary Woodhouse. Her performance is one which is sympathetic and deep because she fuels it with stress without ever going melodramatic. She makes herself easily likable within a brief period of screen time, and just gets better as the story develops. She makes a sweet presence as Rosemary Woodhouse which leaves audiences easily sympathising for her, and that feeling continues because as she experiences the physical pain of pregnancy and the psychological torture of her paranoia at the world around her. Her emotional involvement in the role is just amazing because she is spot on in expressing the physical distress of the role and her line delivery is so full of internal torture that is seems all too legitimate. Mia Farrow is incredibly dedicated in her role which is so powerful that it is unforgettable. It is surprising that Mia Farrow didn't get nominated for an Academy Award, especially considering that Ruth Gordon was the winner of the Best Supporting Actress award in a performance which didn't come close to being as good as Mia Farrow.\nI didn't feel as if Ruth Gordon was deserving of an Academy Award win because her performance blended in with the same nature as essentially all the other actors around her aside from Mia Farrow, but her role was certainly well played. She took the part on with easy dedication to the character and a sense of inner quirks which are hinted at on the surface level without being so obvious. Her supporting effort is good because she has interactions with Mia Farrow which contribute to her character well and establish the source of some of her paranoia, assisting the development of the story in the long run.\nJohn Cassavetes also delivers a powerful effort.\tHis supporting role is a strong one because he is able to create a sympathetic character at some times and then just as easily manipulate it into a somewhat antagonistic one during others. He is unpredictable and dead on with the drama. While his wife Rosemary puts up with her own suffering, what Guy deals with is all his own self-indulgent issues which means that John Cassavetes brings his own level of drama to the film in a manner which is almost a subplot. He does it well and is able to interact with Mia Farrow with a chemistry which is unpredictably dramatic. John Cassavetes is able to command the screen at some moments in Rosemary's Baby, even though his screen time is minimal enough so that the focus remains on Mia Farrow.\nSidney Blackmer also does a nice job because he is confident, sophisticated and always subtly suggesting that he has something to hide. \n\nSo although Rosemary's Baby is more of a drama film with minor psychological thriller that build in at a slow pace with a horror effect which is less effective now than it was in 1968, it still remains a well crafted and original horror film with strong directorial work by Roman Polanski and an Academy Award worthy performance from Mia Farrow.",

That's why it's such a delight to sit down with a film that, rather than go for the cheap scares, takes its time to show you something unsettling.  The very idea of Rosemary's Baby makes my skin crawl, so I can't even begin to imagine how women may feel about the idea.\n\nFor those not in the know, the story focuses on (you guessed it) Rosemary and her husband Guy.  They move into a new apartment, get friendly with the neighbors and then . . . things begin to get weird.  After a really bizarre dream involving rape, Rosemary finds herself pregnant.  After this, her neighbors seem to intrude into her every waking moment.  Anyone outside the circle of folks that live within the building seem to drop off like flies.  Fearing for her baby, Rosemary tries to distance herself from these new \"friends\" and eventually suspects them to be involved in some sort of witchcraft.\n\nDirector Roman Polanski goes for the slow burn here and it absolutely works.  The first half hour or so I'd wager to say isn't the most interesting, as it just focuses on the life and times of Rosemary and her husband.  Rosemary is seemingly a bit stilted at first, but after the dream sequence hits and Rosemary's paranoia grows, the audience will only identify with her more.  From a technical standpoint, long shots really allow the tension to build.  One such infamous shot in a phone booth was done all in one take, and masterfully done at that.\n\nIt can be a little infuriating to see how controlled Rosemary is, but given her personality established in the beginning of the film and the times . . . it's not quite in her character to just hop in a taxi and run away.  Of course, when she does try to escape the hellish pit she's fallen into, it's too late.  \n\nPeople these days want to talk about fucked up endings.  Oldboy, for instance.  What a fucked up ending!  Okay, Oldboy DOES have a fucked up ending, but Rosemary's Baby is the originator of fucked up endings in my book.  The whole finale after the baby is born is tense and creates a wonderful sense of dread.  When you think about what actually is and isn't shown, it's amazing the film pulls off what it does.\n\nIt's easy to shove an image in the viewer's face in tandem with a loud noise and call that \"a scare.\"  This is what most horror movies tend to pass off as horror.  Sure, they can be well done and fun when done right, but Rosemary's Baby is the antithesis of that.  It plants an evil seed inside of you and allows it grow and flourish.  The effect of which is that even when the end credits have finished rolling, that macabre feeling is stuck with you.",

Even the mildest, supposedly cheesy horror movie can disturb me  So when reviewing what is generally considered one of the foremost masterpieces of horror, I can't give it a real rating (so I'll give it the most neutral rating I can) nor could I tell you how scary it is, because fear and apprehension come so easily to me. I only saw it as a means to offer moral support to a friend who was watching is as part of Exposure and Response Prevention therapy.  Why am I reviewing it?  I didn't enjoy it in any way, but I did find it fascinating, and I think it has real historical value. It is apparently a great success as a movie about demonic impregnation, but to me what it accomplishes is quite different.  It is a visceral exploration of the collective psychology of many middle/upper middle class women at the time, which would power the second wave of Feminism which was about to hit.  For to me, this is not ultimately a movie about satanism and demons, but it is about Possession:  about being trapped, constrained and controlled, of being a pawn in a scheme of external forces, through one's own reproductive system.  It expresses so well what women of the bourgeoisie were enduring, some at as much a breaking point as Mia Farrow's character.  They were still yet to be more than a piece of a social scheme, often outside of the knowledge of what that even was, with no agency, not even any value beyond how their reproduction could facilitate these schemes.  Combine this with rape and a demon baby and one could see how comically pro-choice this movie could be seen as and no, it doesn't change my pro-life views.  Yet perhaps more cogently than any other artifact of the time, Rosemary's Baby illustrates how desperately trapped upper-middle-class women of the time needed to tear free from a web of lies",

The elderly neighbours become very friendly and eventually tension starts to  ratchet up as the pregnancy progresses. Will an amazingly fluid style Polanski, in his first American film, masterfully and carefully pulls out the stops which leads to a very satisfactory conclusion. The film was produced by horror film maestro William Castle. A solid cast adds gravitas to the proceedings, Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon are well cast and a surprisingly affecting performance by Mia Farrow showing the right balance of maternal instincts and vulnerability along with Cassavetes easily influenced husband. Made prior to The Exorcist and The Omen this film opened up the genre at least 5 years prior to their production. Polanski's pregnant wife Sharon Tate was brutally murdered by the Manson gang the year after this was released and 30 or so years earlier Polanski had narrowly escaped imprisonment in the Nazi concentration camps although family members were not so lucky. The paranoia generated in this film, and his other masterpieces The Tenant and Chinatown certainly appear to come from a place deep in his psyche.

            "content": "Rosemary's Baby wasn't the film that introduced me to the works of Roman Polanski but rather it was Chinatown. So I came into this with very high hopes and thinking it may even top the previous film I have watched, due to the hype and the intriguing subject matter. After watching it twice already, I can clearly say that Rosemary's Baby isn't perfect but it has a lot to offer that proves that it cannot be missed.\n\nRosemary's Baby was based off the novel by Ira Levin and was adapted to the screen by Roman Polanski. I haven't read the novel so I cannot say whether or not the film drives away from the source material but what Polanski has given us here is quite interesting with only minor trips that prevent this from being a perfect film. Rosemary's Baby tackles a very eerie but intriguing subject matter. It explores the idea of a conspiracy based on a cult, and that this cult is against Rosemary and her unborn child. The film mainly follows through Rosemary's experience during her pregnancy and as she gets closer to the end, she also gets closer to the truth. As much as I enjoyed seeing this concept being explored, it was dragged down by the lack of incentive to keep us emotionally engaged throughout, instead all that was bottled up during the second half of the film once the tension started to build. This made the first half felt a little stretched out and at times feeling unnecessary. The dialogue on the other hand, for the most part, is present to serve the plot or at least fill in some backstory to help us understand these characters. Again, it would be interesting if Polanski just added a little incentive here and there. Polanski cleverly avoids giving any confirmation of our suspicions until the last few minutes of the film as throughout the film we follow Rosemary alone, along with her paranoia and stress, and never gives us any moment of peace from it. As the film's plot doesn't fully explain itself until the very end, in second viewing, I was able to see certain characters differently like Guy Woodhouse, as the reasons for his decisions could have been connected to his failing career. This makes us curious on what exactly was discussed in his conversations with the Castevet. Like Guy Woodhouse, I was also able to see a different light on the neighbors as their ability to manipulate us and have us believe on their motives and intentions, just to be surprised later on. Polanski was able to subtly project these shades of characters in his writing, which allows this film to be rewatchable in order for us to get a clearer view of these characters.\n\nRosemary's Baby is Roman Polanski's fifth film. Polanski has already secured his last four films with a fan base that think highly of his previous films. But I think this film is his start in merging the indie style from his previous films with the mainstream style of filmmaking. It seems with this film, the studios truly had faith in his work and let him create the film that he wanted to create. The film's first act functions as a way in easing us into the surrealism and the tone of the film, with dialogue casually bringing up topics of witches and religion, and slowing down the film in order to build tension while allowing characters to flesh themselves out. I think if Polanski maintained the pacing and intensity of the second-third act, then this film would have felt too rushed and prevents us from caring for the characters. Polanski creates his first hour of the film to feel like a play, with characters just talking to one another in a confined space and allowing the actors to completely use their surroundings in order to gain a natural performance. The last hour of the film is where things start to pick up and the horrors of the situation emerge and have us feel stressed for Rosemary. I much prefer the this half of the film in comparison to the first half, as this is where Polanski truly shines by showing his ability in getting a reaction from us, having us also feeling the thoughts and emotions that is currently running through Rosemary. Though I thought highly in Polanski's efforts in creating the first half of the film, regardless I felt that it was quite slow and lacked a bit of a visual or mental incentive to keep us completely invested. It becomes much more enjoyable in subsequent viewings when we already know what happens to Rosemary and understand what every character's motives were. I think the highlight of the film is the film's climax and the scenes that lead towards it, as the sound of a ticking clock having us feel more tense, and that the end will act as an explosion of our minds, which in a way was. The climax, at first, was frightening and I made me wonder why one would do such a thing; but on subsequent viewing, it became more of a dark hilarious experience.\n\nThe cinematography of the film was handled by William A. Fraker, who later on in his career will be nominated awards for his work but for Rosemary's Baby it was under-appreciated. Which I found understandable because this film did truly feel take an amateurish style of photography, with shots only showing what it needs to show you in order to move film along. This isn't necessarily a horrible thing as Fraker was also limited on it's scope as the film truly never goes anywhere but these small confined spaces, with most being in their apartment. Fraker for the most part has his camera constantly moving, it is not so obvious as it only really moves because the actors are moving or are doing some action and the audience needs to see it in order for us to gain something from it. The cinematography allows the scenes to play out, like I said before in order to feel the film like a play, and the camera pulls in and out casually during a scene. This makes the audience feel almost like a ghost that is being manipulated by Polanski. Like I said previously, Fraker and Polanski creates shots that allows the actors to play out an entire scene, not relying so much on cutting back and forth during dialogue in order to create that theater atmosphere. As we get closer to the end, Polanski and Fraker allows us to get closer and closer to Rosemary emotionally supported with tighter close ups and using the camera as a shadow following her wherever she goes.\n\nKrzysztof Komeda is the film's composer and what he has created is hauntingly beautiful. Komeda's score rarely is in display as the film uses silence to create tension at the start and allows the dialogue more to be in display and not have us be too distracted from the actors. The composer's score usually just shows up at moments of high intensity during the first half, and in much more prominent fashion in the second half as the latter is driving us with the tension and suspicion that the first half lacked. The lullaby chant at the beginning of the film is one of the most frightening things I have heard as it has this undertone of evil under it, but if it is just heard as the lullaby alone without the instrumental or Fraker's photography it would just sound like a mother singing to her child with no dark undertone. Sadly Komeda's career was short-lived and he could have been a long time collaborator with Polanski in the future. I wish that the film did contain more of his score as it was truly well crafted but I guess it would have interfered with Polanski's vision.\n\nThe film's actors truly have to work their asses off for this film, as it demands so much from them, Rosemary in particular. Mia Farrow as Rosemary Woodhouse was so great as she portrays this character who is suffering such elevated stress and who feels alone and lonely during her pregnancy even when there are people around her. Farrow makes us feel like we're the only one who is there for her. John Cassavetes was great as Guy Woodhouse. Cassavetes was able to play a man who doesn't come off at all as unlikable, even if certain events and motives may seem to fracture his character. Even at the end of the film, we still feel some sort of sympathy for the man, but this feeling may just be coming from me. Ruth Gordon has impressed me on a little film called Harold and Maude, and I think for Rosemary's Baby she is playing a less complex and interesting character, Minnie Castevet. Her win for supporting actress for this film may be deserving, but she definitely deserved more from her portrayal as Maude. Nevertheless, Gordon doesn't disappoint here with her character rambling on and on, never seeming to give Rosemary or Guy a window of opportunity to even react. Though probably faithful to the novel, I felt that her character needed a bit more for me to truly enjoy watching the character. Sidney Blackmer as Roman Castevet was much more of a joy to watch as he portrays the character so insidiously that you can't help but wanting to warn Rosemary.\n\nRosemary's Baby may not be a perfect film in my eyes but it gets so many things right that I can't help but go back to this when I feel like watching a film that can terrify me and keep me engaged with the technical aspects of the film. The acting is, for the most part, a joy to watch and the film contains patient and subtle cinematography. Polanski has made something wonderful that should at least be given a try even if the subject matter may be too dark for some.",

Right from when they start to socialize, they meet a nice young lady who lives with an old couple, Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman (Sidney Blackmer) Castevet, who seem overly nice for their type. One night, Minnie makes the couple a dessert that puts Rosemary to sleep, where she dreams of an inhuman being raping her around her acquaintances. She wakes up with questions, but everything seems to fade away. One day, as she has wished, Rosemary has become pregnant, seemingly by her husband. However, the baby causes her daily pain and everyone from the neighbors to the doctors that try to help seem to make it worse. She starts to get paranoid and reads certain books on the medicines they've given her and stumbles upon a strange connection to the Castavets with witchcraft. It's a brilliant plot executed very greatly. \n\nACTING:The performances in this film were very great and on-point with their character types. Mia Farrow does a brilliant job of performing the nice then paranoid Rosemary Woodhouse. The emotions she cast in her part were convincing and extremely believable. Everyone else did a great job, but she shined out the most. The other performances worth mentioning would be John Cassavetes as Guy Woodhouse, Ruth Gordon as Minnie Castevet, Sidney Blackmer as Roman Castevet, Maurice Evans as Hutch, and Ralph Bellamy as Dr. Sapirstein. \n\nSCORE:The score in this film was really good. The main theme of the film was very spooky and haunting yet light and relaxing at the same time. I really enjoyed it. \n\nOTHER CONTENT:This film was very good at dragging you into the story and keeping you right up to emotion with Rosemary. When she felt paranoid, you did too. When she was horrified, you were too. Polanski makes this film so that these connections can be felt. This film was also extremely well shot. Each frame, from the \"dream\" scene to the first night in the house and even to the ending climax was shot with such precision and visionary direction that it came of as a very artful form. The only problem I had was that it took a really long time for suspense to build so that it really boiled on the story for a while, or didn't get anywhere too fast. It covered all aspects of the story and Rosemary's trouble quite accurately though. I also didn't like the ending in terms that we didn't get to see the final outcome of Rosemary's child. I'm sure that made audiences everywhere mad at the time. \n\nOVERALL,an awesome Satanic horror with a brilliant plot, very great acting, haunting score, emotional connections, and very well shot moments, but the suspense was really slow to build and it felt a little overlong.",

He effectively constructs a sense of building paranoia and fear in Rosemary, creating an almost claustrophobic environment around her, from which she is powerless to escape.

            "content": "Rosemary's Baby wasn't the film that introduced me to the works of Roman Polanski but rather it was Chinatown. So I came into this with very high hopes and thinking it may even top the previous film I have watched, due to the hype and the intriguing subject matter. After watching it twice already, I can clearly say that Rosemary's Baby isn't perfect but it has a lot to offer that proves that it cannot be missed.\n\nRosemary's Baby was based off the novel by Ira Levin and was adapted to the screen by Roman Polanski. I haven't read the novel so I cannot say whether or not the film drives away from the source material but what Polanski has given us here is quite interesting with only minor trips that prevent this from being a perfect film. Rosemary's Baby tackles a very eerie but intriguing subject matter. It explores the idea of a conspiracy based on a cult, and that this cult is against Rosemary and her unborn child. The film mainly follows through Rosemary's experience during her pregnancy and as she gets closer to the end, she also gets closer to the truth. As much as I enjoyed seeing this concept being explored, it was dragged down by the lack of incentive to keep us emotionally engaged throughout, instead all that was bottled up for the second half of the film once the tension started to build. This made the first half felt a little stretched out and at times feeling unnecessary. The dialogue on the other hand, for the most part, is present to serve the plot or at least fill in some backstory to help us understand these characters. Again, it would be interesting if Polanski just added a little incentive here and there. Polanski cleverly avoids giving any confirmation of our suspicions until the last few minutes of the film as throughout the film we follow Rosemary alone, along with her paranoia and stress, and never gives us any moment of peace from it. As the film's plot doesn't fully explain itself until the very end, in second viewing, I was able to see certain characters differently like Guy Woodhouse, as the reasons for his decisions could have been connected to his failing career. This makes us curious on what exactly was discussed in his conversations with the Castevet. Like Guy Woodhouse, I was also able to see a different light on the neighbors as their ability to manipulate us and have us believe on their motives and intentions, just to be surprised later on. Polanski was able to subtly project these shades of characters in his writing, which allows this film to be rewatchable in order for us to get a clearer view of these characters.\n\nRosemary's Baby is Roman Polanski's fifth film. Polanski has already secured his last four films with a fan base that think highly of his previous films. But I think this film is his start in merging the indie style from his previous films with the mainstream style of filmmaking. It seems with this film, the studios truly had faith in his work and let him create the film that he wanted to create. The film's first act functions as a way in easing us into the surrealism and the tone of the film, with dialogue casually bringing up topics of witches and religion, and slowing down the film in order to build tension while allowing characters to flesh themselves out. I think if Polanski maintained the pacing and intensity of the second-third act, then this film would have felt too rushed and prevents us from caring for the characters. Polanski creates his first hour of the film to feel like a play, with characters just talking to one another in a confined space and allowing the actors to completely use their surroundings in order to gain a natural performance. The last hour of the film is where things start to pick up and the horrors of the situation emerge and have us feel stressed for Rosemary. I much prefer the this half of the film in comparison to the first half, as this is where Polanski truly shines by showing his ability in getting a reaction from us, having us also feeling the thoughts and emotions that is currently running through Rosemary. Though I thought highly in Polanski's efforts in creating the first half of the film, regardless I felt that it was quite slow and lacked a bit of a visual or mental incentive to keep us completely invested. It becomes much more enjoyable in subsequent viewings when we already know what happens to Rosemary and understand what every character's motives were. I think the highlight of the film is the film's climax and the scenes that lead towards it, as the sound of a ticking clock having us feel more tense, and that the end will act as an explosion of our minds, which in a way was. The climax, at first, was frightening and I made me wonder why one would do such a thing; but on subsequent viewing, it became more of a dark hilarious experience.\n\nThe cinematography of the film was handled by William A. Fraker, who later on in his career will be nominated awards for his work but for Rosemary's Baby it was under-appreciated. Which I found understandable because this film did truly feel take an amateurish style of photography, with shots only showing what it needs to show you in order to move film along. This isn't necessarily a horrible thing as Fraker was also limited on it's scope as the film truly never goes anywhere but these small confined spaces, with most being in their apartment. Fraker for the most part has his camera constantly moving, it is not so obvious as it only really moves because the actors are moving or are doing some action and the audience needs to see it in order for us to gain something from it. The cinematography allows the scenes to play out, like I said before in order to feel the film like a play, and the camera pulls in and out casually during a scene. This makes the audience feel almost like a ghost that is being manipulated by Polanski. Like I said previously, Fraker and Polanski creates shots that allows the actors to play out an entire scene, not relying so much on cutting back and forth during dialogue in order to create that theater atmosphere. As we get closer to the end, Polanski and Fraker allows us to get closer and closer to Rosemary emotionally supported with tighter close ups and using the camera as a shadow following her wherever she goes.\n\nKrzysztof Komeda is the film's composer and what he has created is hauntingly beautiful. Komeda's score rarely is in display as the film uses silence to create tension at the start and allows the dialogue more to be in display and not have us be too distracted from the actors. The composer's score usually just shows up at moments of high intensity during the first half, and in much more prominent fashion in the second half as the latter is driving us with the tension and suspicion that the first half lacked. The lullaby chant at the beginning of the film is one of the most frightening things I have heard as it has this undertone of evil under it, but if it is just heard as the lullaby alone without the instrumental or Fraker's photography it would just sound like a mother singing to her child with no dark undertone. Sadly Komeda's career was short-lived and he could have been a long time collaborator with Polanski in the future. I wish that the film did contain more of his score as it was truly well crafted but I guess it would have interfered with Polanski's vision.\n\nThe film's actors truly have to work their asses off for this film, as it demands so much from them, Rosemary in particular. Mia Farrow as Rosemary Woodhouse was so great as she portrays this character who is suffering such elevated stress and who feels alone and lonely during her pregnancy even when there are people around her. Farrow makes us feel like we're the only one who is there for her. John Cassavetes was great as Guy Woodhouse. Cassavetes was able to play a man who doesn't come off at all as unlikable, even if certain events and motives may seem to fracture his character. Even at the end of the film, we still feel some sort of sympathy for the man, but this feeling may just be coming from me. Ruth Gordon has impressed me on a little film called Harold and Maude, and I think for Rosemary's Baby she is playing a less complex and interesting character, Minnie Castevet. Her win for supporting actress for this film may be deserving, but she definitely deserved more from her portrayal as Maude. Nevertheless, Gordon doesn't disappoint here with her character rambling on and on, never seeming to give Rosemary or Guy a window of opportunity to even react. Though probably faithful to the novel, I felt that her character needed a bit more for me to truly enjoy watching the character. Sidney Blackmer as Roman Castevet was much more of a joy to watch as he portrays the character so insidiously that you can't help but wanting to warn Rosemary.\n\nRosemary's Baby may not be a perfect film in my eyes but it gets so many things right that I can't help but go back to this when I feel like watching a film that can terrify me and keep me engaged with the technical aspects of the film. The acting is, for the most part, a joy to watch and the film contains patient and subtle cinematography. Polanski has made something wonderful that should at least be given a try even if the subject matter may be too dark for some.",

It is very slow for a contemporary film, but the growing sense of dread and claustrophobia means it still packs a bit of a punch. Having read the Ira Levin novel, I knew a bit too much going in, but I can imagine that uninitiated audiences in t 1968 must have been quite disturbing. Heck, I'm pretty disturbed. Once you get past Mia Farrow's breathlessness, which is kind of annoying for the first twenty minutes, her descent into paranoia is all to believable, as her final break with reality at the end of the film is as well.

            "content": "Rosemary's Baby is my favorite horror film of all time. Its got it all: a genius director, marvelous actors, a haunting tale, spooky neighbors, dastardly witches, and, of course, Satan. The film revolves around a young woman named Rosemary Woodhouse. Rosemary and her husband are expecting a child. But Rosemary doesn't look so good. Rosemary is starting to believe that she has been impregnated by evil itself, and everyone she knows might be in on it. As a thriller it works on a level Hitchcock only hinted at. Its a film that surpasses masterpiece and classic, and rests snug atop the terrain of legend.\n\nIt was once a venial sin to watch this film, condemned by the Catholic Church and the Legion Of Decency, now you can own it in glorious High-Definition, with a genial satisfaction only Criterion could bestow.\n\nThis film only gets creepier and creepier with time. There are several different ways to watch this film. And this film, in turn, tries to tell us many several different things. As film scholar David J. Skal points out in his fantastic book 'The Monster Show':\n\n\"Whether Levin's strategy was conscious or not, the plot of Rosemary's Baby was a brilliant metaphorical distillation of the widespread ambivalence and anxiety over sex and reproduction, concerns overshadowed by the garish glare of the swinging sixties. On a simplistic level, both Rosemary and the reader share lingering doubts about the chemical-occult tinkering of their reproductive systems. Rosemary drinks the stinking tannis-root cocktail that her neighbor provides while the reader(likely) swallows the magic candy of birth-control pills. Neither has a deep understanding of the effects of either substance on their bodies and their lives; they rely trustingly on patriarchal authority. Rosemary Woodhouse is led repeatedly to believe she is making her own carefully considered reproductive choices, but the decisions are all being made for her. No matter what assurances are offered, no matter what charms and preparations she uses or ingests, she is not really safe. One of the many indelible images in the film version of Rosemary's Baby is the pregnant but wasted-looking Mia Farrow dashing out against the light into midtown traffic, an apt metaphor for child-bearing under socio-technological seige.\"\n\nRoman Polanski is my favorite living Director. He is without a doubt the most cathartic of any, living or dead, and damn near the most personal. To think that just one year after making Rosemary's Baby, tragedy would strike his home, wife, and child, is far too horrifying a concept to accept as reality. Polanski fought back with films like Macbeth and Chinatown, both are nothing short of cinematic exorcisms; Polanski fighting off his demons. His films are usually deeply personal, and Rosemary's Baby is no exception.\n\nAnother one of my personal heroes had a hand in the creation of Rosemary's Baby.\n\nJohn Cassavetes gives an outrageously good performance as Rosemary's husband, Guy Woodhouse. The performance Cassavetes lays down gets better and better, and more and more complex the more you watch the film. Mia Farrow is the obvious force to be reckoned with here, but Cassavetes' performance is quickly overshadowing her's for me. Its a performance of subtlety and nuance. Each look, motion, action, pause, and word takes on different meanings after repeated viewings. Sadly, Cassavetes and Polanski hated each other. Polanski has gone on record discrediting Cassavetes' abilities as not only an actor, but as a filmmaker. And Cassavetes can be quoted as saying, \"You can't dispute the fact he's an artist, but yet you have to say Rosemary's Baby is not art\". The two nearly came to blows, and by the end of production had grown loathsome of each other. But you could've fooled me. It seems as if everyone involved with this film were in tune with each other, in perfect sync.\n\nWhat Mia Farrow does in this film is indescribable. You'll be hard-pressed to find a more empathetic portrayal of a damsel in distress. I felt all of her fears, and shared more than just basic emotions. Mia Farrow had the ability to communicate feelings effortlessly on film, a very rare and unique gift that Polanski skillfully manipulates and fine-tunes. Not only a great performance but an iconic one. \"What have you done to its eyes\" will stay with me forever.\n\nIt is a truly mystifying picture. Its impossible to not feel Rosemary's paranoia, or even question her sanity, or your logic. Atmospheric and isolated at the same time, this film will play with your sensibilities. If you have not seen it, I highly recommend this one. This is a film that should not be missed by anyone. It is just that good.\n\nAnd this Blu-Ray Edition is stellar. The picture is very good, and what we've come to expect from Criterion: Quality Above All Else. The colors are very impressive. When compared to the previous DVD release, the picture is a Godsend. The sound is even better. Krzyzstof Komeda's score has never sounded better. Its as if this was my very first time actually hearing it. It was a wonderful experience.\n\nThe supplements, in my honest opinion, could have included a little bit more red meat. The disc includes an Interview with Author Ira Levin from 1997, a feature length documentary about the composer of the picture, and the best stuff collected by Criterion: the new interviews with Roman Polanski, Robert Evans, and Mia Farrow herself, I can see myself watching these many times over. But, not to gripe with a next to perfect release of my favorite film, it could have easily included a commentary track. Or the Vintage Behind The Scenes Feature available on the previous DVD release. I guess Criterion just didn't feel like going all out with this one, which is sad for me, I just can't get enough of this one.\n\nRegardless of how I feel about the bonus features, the movie LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Thank you Criterion a million times over! If you're a fan of the film, DO NOT HESITATE. Its worth the upgrade, its worth the cost, and you'll love the product!",

            "content": "If I had to pick a horror flick that perfectly captures that disturbing feeling of paranoia, then 'Rosemary's Baby' would be a perfect example. It's the type of paranoia of which things are not really what they seem or if you're just thinking way in over your head by creating this make-believe scenario.\n\nWhat I love about this film is that it perfectly captures this despondent atmosphere as the story progresses with the subtle nuances of the music, but to me, I think it mostly boils down to Mia Farrow's performance of Rosemary Woodhouse. She consistently conveys that paranoid feeling and you can feel her emotions when she is dealing with surroundings that are progressively provoking her suspicions, based on her perceptions.\n\nAnd that is basically where the 'horror' of the movie comes from which is the mood and it takes alot of work just to use that as the only source of causing a feeling of dread in the viewer. It perfectly falls in line with the New Hollywood genre in that it relies on subtle nuances instead of huge melodrama, surprisingly creating something that is far more effective than your average blockbuster affair. There's only some disturbing imagery, but as Rosemary grows more weary of the other characters, you can feel that same dread as well. Other than that, there are no special effects, cheap high volume scares, or fast paced horror, just outstanding performances, especially from Ruth Gordon.\n\nRosenary's Baby is a work of art in that it shines in creating horror that is bare and minimal, yet surprisingly still being able to retain a strong, brooding atmosphere that pulls you in and never lets you go until the end of the movie. 5/5",

Story, acting, directing...all around. I wish I would have watched it years ago!",

Satanic terrors aside, it really tells the tale of a woman alienated from her friends, husband and even her newborn. It's devastatingly depressing not because of its downbeat and off-kilter conclusion, but due to the total separation of Mother and Child.\n\nThe film is moody and disturbing but not horrific. The characters are unforgettable and the acting is superb. However, it also plays campy and ends on a rather silly note. The \"Hail Satan!\" cheers are as giggle-inducing now as they were chilling to theater goers in the late '60s.",

For one, I dislike the main theme's use of ethereal singing (which only appears during the opening and closing credits). It was a fad during the late Sixties/early Seventies--Ennio Morricone, Lalo Schifrin, Michael Small and Jerry Goldsmith all did it. I think it got old really fast, but Im sure most people don't/should't care. Also, I don't like witchcraft or cults. *KINDA/SORTA SPOILER* I would have preferred one of two endings: either it turns out it was all in her head, or she actually kills the baby. I don't know how the book ends, and maybe that ambiguous ending is what makes it so great. In my mind, nothing will top the ending to Polanski's own CHINATOWN.",
