            "content": "This is a very interesting visual journey. The practical effects seen in the memory scenes probably make this worth watching alone. The story is quite interesting. There's nothing that dates this movie in an outright way, however I feel it's starting to be dated just by the overall visual style of the time. Early 2000s indy films just look a certain type of way, and in my opinion thats starting to date some movies. While it didn't seem too striking at the time, Jim Carrey basically dressing like a very early emo kid/hipster sticks out a little too much from the rest of the character styles. I would say it's pretty damn good, but it just teters on the brink of being great. Definitely worth a watch if you've never seen it though. 7.75/10",

            "content": "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the end result of combining sci-fi and romance into a wholly original and superbly acted script. Joel (played with an every-man nuance by Jim Carrey in a way not seen since his turn on The Truman Show) breaks up with his girlfriend, Clementine (played by Kate Winslet with an artistic, indie girl charm) and decides to undergo an experimental procedure in which she is erased from his memories so that the post-breakup healing can commence without those pesky doubts and regrets that so often accompany the end of a relationship. The process itself is the bulk of the film and viewers are treated into glimpses of Joel's mind as Clementine is systematically deleted. It isn't until Joel is under and the procedure has began that he realizes that even though his breakup was difficult he was shaped by it, and losing all of those experiences (the good and the bad) would erase a part of himself. What results is Joel's attempts to hang on to what is important by fighting through the feelings that attach themselves to each piece of their relationship and fighting the efforts of those hired to purge these memories (Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo) while inside of the procedure. It's a beautiful film whose subject matter is complex enough to be engaging while being relatable enough to be sympathetic to either outcome. It's a modern classic detailing the entirety of a relationship in a completely original and captivating way that makes viewers consider their own experiences as the credits roll. A masterpiece of filmmaking.",

What if you could medically erase the memories of any one person that you'd like to forget?  Would you and what would it take to see it through?  Well acted by everyone with Ruffalo and Dunst memorable in support.  Carrey and Winslet are reliably good as the leads in an unusual and creative (Oscar winning) original screenplay.  Certainly a must-see.",

A bit muddly but understandable enough...bit of sci-fi license and an open mind needed. Very believable acting. Got very drawn in to it. Amusing, entertaining, thought provoking and heart lifting.",

A beautiful blend of romance, drama, thriller, and sci-fi that truly had me feeling for the main character. Without spoiling anything or bringing up what can be seen in a trailer for the film, I will say that this is the kind of movie that really works your mind and makes you think a bit, but not in an unrewarding manner. Don't watch it with people who like to talk or cause distractions. I've watched it several times and I prefer watching it alone. It sounds weird when you have to watch a movie under certain conditions to maximize your enjoyment, but this one is worth it. There's a reason the scores are so high on this one. Check it out!",
