The ending was good but it wasn't something big and shocking that you couldn't believe what was happening, infact\u00a0the beginning of the movie was far better than the ending. What I would definitely would have wanted to see is a sequel where they all stuck on that island with\u00a0zombies, it could have been called\u00a0Island of the Dead. \n\nThe\u00a0story\u00a0wasn't epic at all but mostly about the\u00a0characters, but one thing that is very disappointing is\u00a0as if they forgot the location is just as important as the characters, they were in the mall but they didn't use it to there advantage, the\u00a0original movie, which I only watched once and even though I don't remember much about it but one thing I do remember was how much they used re location to be part of the\u00a0story\u00a0aswell but this movie didn't do that aswell, did weel see them in the\u00a0grocery store? Taking\u00a0clothing?\u00a0Electronic\u00a0store? Looking for\u00a0weapons? How long did we have to watch them watch a guy on the roof that leads to absolutely nothing? Might as well have had a pot plant there because it wouldn't have made a difference. I'm sorry the movie was consistent in its\u00a0story\u00a0but it was just a very mediocre film as a whole.",

Just hit me with a stick or something, I'll crumple like an old paper bag. I'm an intro zombie, not final boss material. \n\nLooking visually saturated in the way that only mid-2000s movies do, Zack Snyder transitions into the role of director with a remake of the classic George Romero zombie flick, hitting many of the same story beats while giving it way more of an action flavor. As a result, there is much less of an emphasis on the cutting social themes that the latter imbued his original work with, but Snyder still largely succeeds with some interesting subplots, great practical effects, and character dynamics (including, *gasp*, actual character development for individuals like Michael Kelly's CJ, who goes from totalitarian despot to supportive ally). It's got tonal inconsistencies thanks to some components of the original that were adapted wholesale alongside James Gunn's tendency towards jokes and action excess, but as a piece of entertainment Dawn of the Dead helped to reignite interest in wha had been a pretty lagging zombie genre. \n\nMakes you wonder where so much went wrong with Snyder's soft sequel Army of the Dead more than 15 years later.

Snyder is known for many things in his film adventures, his soundtrack offerings always bring about a great laugh.

I'm not saying it is better than the original but it comes very close. The gore is excellent and feels very real as they are real. The more action sequences have a lot of visual effects but they work for action with detracting from the excitement. The human elements are so well done. There are plenty of hairs-standing-on-end moments but also exciting and shocking scenes. There is very little time to relax and no room for boredom. Highly recommended so long as you go into this open minded.",

Then again, it is a James Gunn script. I may have never seen the original Dawn of the Dead movie but this Snyder/Gunn collaboration is still a worthy debut for the former...and, if I'm being honest and in spite of giving the same number of stars, a better zombie film than his own original zombie film.

Whereas in GOTG audiences were treated to humanity from the most alien, in Dawn, it's humanity at it's most base and worse.\n And Snyder master of slo-mo really shows his green here. I didn't need to see a cigarette get stamped out in slow motion. And if this is an ultra violent R-Rated flick, why weren't audiences treated to the zombie babies' head being blown off?\n This is a movie that claims maturity, but cowers in childlike terror , just like each of the characters featured in the film.\n And the force feeded romance towards the end of the film, was a silly use of a trope that could have been cut for more gore, which I'm sure all the audiences came to see.\n Honestly, the best thing this film had going for it other than the camera shots at the beginning car ride scene was the tension behind having a pregnant woman attempt to survive a zombie apocalypse , and the \"Aliens\" like hi-jinks that could possibly ensue.\n The opportunity was lost and wasted though, just like Mekhi Phipher's character in the film, all over poor decisions.\n I get this is both Gunn & Snyder on the rookie tip, but Tarantino dropped \"...Dogs\" out the gate , there is no excuses.\n In no way does this film with it's stupid elevator scene, poor plot devices, and kamikaze events as penance for bad decisions make me want to revisit the original.\n Yes this film inspired alot of COD:Black Ops zombie runs, but other than that it's a boon to a genre that honestly, I've never been a big fan of. Then again, I've always been more Zombieland than Walking Dead.\n-\nAudiomack.com/cvrthebard",

Dawn of the Dead is truly a typical model for Zombie movies due to a relentless script which is replete with thrill and upcoming events. The movie undoubtedly has a kind of clich\u00e9 script and poor character development in sacrifice for a more entertaining scenes of action and killings. However, the movie is uniquely exquisite when it comes to give out message and lesson. It is not pompous and heroic like other movies but so tranqil and real instead. Some of the scenerios in the movie are somewhat pleasantly surprising accompanied with obsessively horrific images.

            "content": "A remake of the much loved and revered masterpiece Dawn of the Dead was always going to be sneered at by fans and film scholars alike when the project was announced.\n\nI actually saw the film on it's release when I was visiting Glasgow and was expecting to roll my eyes constantly whilst saying \u2018Psst!' under my breath a few hundred times (but not too loudly\u2026) during the film's running time. I was pleasantly surprised though. Whilst it was no worthy competition for Romero's original film in terms of it's coveted place in horror history, it was far from mediocre. In fact, it was really rather good!\n\nThe opening scenes show central character Ana finish a long shift as a nurse at her local hospital and return home. The next day a little girl from her neighbourhood comes into her house and shows that all it not well. She has changed into a zombie and fatally attacks her partner, ripping out a chunk of his neck with her teeth. Very quickly, he then springs back to life and also in a zombiefied state like the girl who attacked him.\n\nAna gets to her car and we then see that the very fabric of society has broken down almost completely. People are either dead and running around as zombies and trying to kill others, or they are still human but have either gone completely crazy (witness Ana's neighbour armed with a gun) or are in \u2018survival of the fittest' mode with no regard for anyone else around them (someone attempts to hijack Ana's car by trying to jump into it).\n\nAfter running off the road, Ana crosses paths with cop Kenneth who, with other characters (one of them pregnant!), goes to the neighbouring mall for refuge.\n\nThe mall is where the majority of the rest of the movie takes place just like the original. There's even a nod to the first film with a sign for a shop called Gaylen Ross. The theme of a crisis bringing out the best and worst in a person's character is explored well here with the security guards who are already in the shopping centre having marked it as their territory and only letting the new arrivals take refuge if they surrender their weapons and adhere to their rules and laws. This is very Lord of the Flies.\n\nThe next day even more characters are interjected into the narrative by way of a delivery truck and we now have our cast in place for the rest of the film. And this is one of the major strengths for the remake and that is that the characters are so brilliantly sketched and well rounded. There is a fantastic diversity and range within the characters with some changing by the time of the film's conclusion so that our expectations are constantly being challenged and contradicted with seemingly vile people redeeming themselves and vice versa.\n\nThe film also perceptively displays human relationships at work. On first arrival most of the characters rub along pretty well. But being in a confined space together soon causes divisions and differences to develop and flare up. The film soon becomes something akin to events in a season of Big Brother but with, obviously, more at stake.\n\nAs well as great characterisation we also get great make up and effects. The special effects for the film were actually by the company owned by Heather Langenkamp aka Nancy Thompson from the Nightmare on Elm Street films! She should be very proud with the results as they are fabulous.\n\nScott Reiniger, Ken Foree and Tom Savini from the original all get cameos well as the Gaylen Ross reference/homage.\n\nThe zombies in this film move a lot faster than their blue-skinned counterparts from the original which massively divided fans with Romero himself saying that he didn't like this aspect. I personally think it doesn't really bother me as it's something new just like the film itself. There's also a new rule regarding the dead turning into zombies with there being a set time of a few seconds before the dead arise again. I thought this was also an interesting new aspect of this remake/reimagining.\n\nThere is also some great humour in the movie also. Witness the \u2018Celebrity Squares' game that Kenneth plays with his gun shop buddy who is trapped on the roof of his business nearby. This also blossoms into a great moment of camaraderie and dare I say bromance between the two characters. Again, this echoes the same kind of relationship that Scott and Peter had in the original. I thought that it was great that this was reproduced in the remake.\n\nI have to say though that on watching this film again for this review after seeing it on it's original release brought diminishing returns this time around. It was almost like when you know what to expect with this remake half of the fun has gone.\n\nThis remake will never come close to the original film. But on first viewing it was interesting, innovative and had some artistic merit. It's also a great rollercoaster ride that didn't make me roll my eyes once.",

The intro of the film is one of the strongest in the genre of zombie films. That being said, Dawn of the Dead plods about in its second act, and tries to have edgy takes on the genre which even upon its release felt campy and overdone. Seriously, pregnant zombie babies? We don't need that. The film still maintains its unique panache, especially with its musical interludes. But the film definitely never was too strong to begin with, and relied more on its grimdark and nearly dark-comedy aesthetic to carry it. Fortunately, that is still the workhorse of the film to this day.",

I'm basically just pointing out why we can't have nice things, people argue about it.\n\nThis has a great cast: Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley and Jake Weber in particular.  The production value was definitely present, and not just in renting a mall to trash, or even just the zombie practical effects.\n\nThe large scale scenes look amazing, and the details on the various infections are fascinating to watch.  And sure, there is lots of quality gunfire (foley is good) and shooting zombies for people you are just in it for the action.  While it's actually got some good (if dark at times) humor to it, it's not \"Warm Bodies\".\n\nOf course the presence of zombies / apocalyptic situation / lack of central authority gives us great philosophical opportunity to discuss what life means and see how people behave, but this leans more towards survival strategy aspects.\n\nIf anything, I think that is where the \"flaw\" is in this movie: (most of) the characters are relatively competent so it detours some from typical movie formula relying on the characters to make mistakes to progress the story, but more of there is just a hopeless unending storm of bad things happening to them, it's honestly a little refreshing.\n\nThis is probably one of my favorite zombie movies, and I don't even like running zombies.",

Other than these things, it makes enough sense, explores the \"why's\" of zombies, and has a logical progression overall. Some of the people are just Stupid-stupid, like this bus scene with this balding guy, and other bad and stupid scenes like this that leaves a bad image, But it makes a lot of sense and is actually a solid progression A-B. Some characters do a great job, like the cop and the lead female protagonist, and her origins are legit. These are Fast zombies, so they are Fast. You don't have much time to think when fighting fast zombies, and they think it through pretty well except for the main mall security guard toward the end. How it all ends up is great also, and makes a lot of sense. Overall, I'd say it is a post-modern \"cyberpunk\" version of zombies that tried to be \"hip and cool,\" and mostly it actually did this.

Instead of building tension this rushes from one exploding head to the next until it culminates in a string of highly repetitive propane tank explosions (interspersed with more exploding heads). The gore in Romero's original punctuated the horror whereas here it's the meat of the matter. Some points are telegraphed well in advance (OMG, a pregnant woman--think we'll see a zombie baby?) while other potentially suspenseful sequences seem entirely omitted, as when six survivors in a truck outside are transported to safety inside in the literal blink of an eye jump cut. Senseless action, illogical choices (even for a horror movie), and a bloated cast of characters with little to zero individual identity. Weirdly, the best part of this movie is the opening pre-credits sequence, then inexplicably the resolution is presented in spasms during the closing credits. The whole thing feels rushed. This movie might actually make you dumber by lowering your standards. Stick with the original. ",

            "content": "Surprisingly good remake of the George A. Romeo zombie apocalypse classic. It's tricky doing a remake of a beloved cult classic, so when I originally went to the theater to watch this film, I went in expecting to hate it, especially since the film was written by the same guy who wrote the terrible live-action Scooby Doo movie, along with some first-time director I'd never heard of and who'd only done music videos and commercials. However, right from the opening moments of the film, with a quiet suburban neighborhood quickly descending into a fight for survival from zombie hoards to when the opening credits roll to Johnny Cash singing \"When the Man Comes\" around, I was hooked! Little did I know that writer James Gunn would go on to write other terrifically smart and subversive mainstream genre films like \"Slither,\" \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" as well as the little seen low budget films like \"Super\" and \"The Belko Experiment\" and that director Zach Snyder would go on to tackle (more successfully than you'd expect) other sacred cows such as \"The Watchmen\" and \"Man of Steel.\" Compared to Romero's original, this remake is minus the political subtext Romero infused into all of his zombie films, but it does manage to capture the original film's balance of comedy and horror. Both films are for the most part straight faced horror films, punctuated with moments of levity and black humor. The remake delved less into the audience fantasy aspect of getting to have the run of a shopping mall (similar to \"Night of the Comet\"), but the humor Gunn placed into his script was arguably much more witty when compared to Romero's more pie-in-the-face style of slapstick comedy. The remake also boasts a strong cast that includes Sarah Polley (a nurse), Ving Rhames (a cop), Mekhi Phifer (an expectant father), Jake Weber (a nice guy), Ty Burrell (a rich jerk), and Michael Kelly (a mall cop). Another charm of the film for fans of the original is that while it does deviate from the original in many ways (running zombie instead of slow zombies, changing most of the characters and scenarios, and keeping really only the basic concept of people holding up in a mall during a zombie apocalypse), the filmmakers included many Easter eggs and nods to the original films, including a truck crashing into a diner (a nod to a story shared by Ben in the original film) or the mall being named after the lead actress in the original film, or cameo appearances by the three stars of the original film (Scott H. Reiniger, Tom Savini, and Ken Foree), and many others. Overall, the world did not need or ask for a \"Dawn of the Dead\" remake, but Gunn and Synder managed defy my fanboy reservations and won me over to their new vision of Romero's horror classic. Well worth watching for fans of contemporary zombie films as well as for fans of the old school original film. ",

It picks up again in the final 20 minutes for a bang up finale.\n\nGood cast, decent zombie makeup, and an actual budget, puts DOD head and shoulders above the rest.\n\nDawn came out just days ahead of Simon Pegg's love letter to George Romero, Shaun Of The Dead.

            "content": "I'm not a horror movie expert, in fact I kind of despise them, but I would like to suggest that there is one key element you need in a horror film to make it work well. You have to get the audience to connect with and care about the characters, and I think this is even more vital in an end-of-the-world type of movie like Dawn of the Dead because the characters become representative of all humanity. So my big struggle with this movie is that I didn't like any of the characters. For one thing they didn't seem to have much depth to their stories, most of them were just stereotypes. They tried to have these moments where they shared some of the past, but it was too little too late. It didn't help that, after establishing a small handful of characters, they felt the need to continuously inject more people just so they could have more bodies to add to the body count. If anything these added characters just became a distraction from the original group that I wanted to get to know better. This mall of people were possibly the last human beings on Earth, and I just wanted them all to die. It was a mindless zombie movie and I was rooting for the zombies...never a good sign.\n\nThe plot of Dawn of the Dead is virtually non-existent. Some people hole up in a mall trying to avoid the zombie apocalypse. That's the whole story. Amazingly despite some walls made of nothing more than glass and thousands of zombies crowding around the mall, they seem to be remarkably fortified in the mall. In fact they actually have to create plot reasons for the characters to venture out of the mall or to bring zombies in. The other annoyance I found in the Dawn of the Dead was how inconsistent the rules of zombie transformation seemed to be. It's like the duration of time from bite to death wildly shifted depending on the requirements of the plot. And that's just one example of how every beat of this movie felt like it was written solely for the convenience of moving the plot along. For example, it didn't make sense for Michael and Ana to suddenly start making out, but they needed those characters to be in love so it would add some poignancy to the end of the movie. Oh and speaking of the end, if I cared one ounce for these people I would have been simply livid with the credits scene. What is the purpose of tacking on an everybody-dies ending? I found almost nothing to like in this movie. I can't give it the lowest possible rating because at least the story was somewhat coherent and I didn't feel the need to shut off the TV halfway through, but I will gladly never watch this again and might even avoid other films that feature these actors since they were so terrible in this movie.",

Though I still prefer the satirical angle on consumerism Romero utilized in his 70's original (and for that reason alone it would make a great double bill with 'Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom', at least from Pier Paolo Pasolini's philosophical context), this is head and shoulders (shot, of course, so it doesn't come back as a zombie) above other remakes of this era.

            "content": "I never saw the original Dawn of the Dead, but it was said to he one of the way better remakes of a popular film from the past, so it sounded worthy of a shot.\n\nDawn of the Dead doesn't mess around. Director Zack Snyder knows what it requires and jumps right into it by kicking the story off into immediate horror with plenty of blood, gore and drama. It kicks off into the thrills immediately and doesn't go into depth about its story.  The thing is that Dawn of the Dead doesn't attempt to reinvent the zombie genre, it makes the effort to simply update it. And while it features many of the same flaws that usual zombie films have such as a fairly slow pace and certain predictable elements, Dawn of the Dead succeeds at paying tribute to the original George A. Romero film while also succeeding on its own terms as a zombie feature of its own right and success. \nPacked with plenty of excellent blood and gore, Zack Snyder ensures that Dawn of the Dead is an excellently visually appealing film. It is thoroughly colourful as well as being shot with stylish horror-defining cinematography and a lot of timely editing, as well as some intense sound effects and an atmospheric musical score. Essentially, Dawn of the Dead does everything necessary to succeed as a strong horror film, and very few remakes ever succeed at that due to betraying their source material. Dawn of the Dead simply follows the basic zombie source material of the original film and manages to work some entertainment into its story while updating certain aspects so that it appeals to the contemporary crowd. And while it has some of the same basic issues that come with a Zombie film with a simple story such as the fact that it doesn't really attempt to break new ground and is fairly predictable at times, it still works as sufficient horror entertainment. And from a dramatic standpoint, Dawn of the Dead is a success as well due to how it emphasises certain character elements to give the film a sense of humanity as well as a large scale zombie horror feeling. The dramatisation of Frank's death scene was done excellently. It really capitalises on the essence of the horror situation while not degrading the dramatic mood of the situation through overuse of gore visuals. Dawn of the Dead remembers to capitalise on the dramatic elements of its story and the character drama instead of putting sole focus on the blood and gore which is what too many films these days do. So Zack Snyder ensures that the focus in Dawn of the Dead is on thrills, drama and blood all together while letting the other elements unfold naturally, and this shows promise for him as a film director.\nThe script in Dawn of the Dead follows a very B-movie style which seems intentionally cliche, and I gives a slight humourous edge to the film. Dawn of the Dead has the feel of a serious zombie horror film with a touch of dark comedy, and I found I was able to take everything seriously while admiring some of the B-movie qualities of the film for a little comedic fun amidst all the horror thrills.\nAnd well enough, the cast of Dawn of the Dead do their part.\nSarah Polley makes a fairly effective lead by conveying a sense of dramatic realism as she faces all the weird situations that come with a Zombie apocalypse. While she doesn't get too involved in the story after the intro and isn't perfectly consistent with the effect of her line delivery, she does manage to deliver a performance good enough to pass.\nBut nobody in the film can hold a candle to Ving Rhames.  Ving Rhames is the perfect casting choice for Dawn of the Dead. Because he is a serious badass without being a very commercial actor, he is an ideal lead because he has the credibility of a hero without having a name for the filmmakers to flaunt around as a massive superstar. But he has the appeal of being the badass Marsellus Wallas from Pulp Fiction and many other roles to his fans. So he is a great cast member, and his ferocity and intimidating stature give him the awesome look of a hero. He is the best cast member in Dawn of the Dead and has more than enough intimidation as an appeal, and his skilful performance of his lines have a B-movie feel and a genuine sense of heroism both at the same time. Ving Rhames is a flawless casting decision for Dawn of the Dead.\nKevin Zegers manages to give an effective supporting effort as well where he puts a lot of realism into his performance and lets himself develop naturally over the course of the film.\nFrankly, every cast member gives a necessary effort to succeed, even though most of them are little known actors. But considering the later international success of Ty Burrell for his role as Phil Dunphy in the hilarious comedy series Modern Family, it is great to see him acting early on in a role that is earlier on above many other cast members. His character has the same sort of neuroticism as Phil Dunphy, but his arrogance makes him a convincing addition to the cast as a real asshole.\n\nSo Dawn of the Dead is a thoroughly convincing; thrilling zombie movie which has plenty of thrills and appeal from a visual perspective and is acted well too, so it works as both a strong horror film of its own right and a better remake than half the available remakes available today.",

The film starts in a hospital that is being swamped by very strange cases of people being bitten. Nurse Ana (The Dynamic) Sarah Polley is exhausted at the end of her shift and just wants to get home. There is a brief scene with her loving husband, and she is off to sleep. She awakes to the the young girl next door in her bedroom, and looking very peculiar. When the child attacks her husband, the situation goes from bad to worse case scenario. This is confirmed when the media reports the dead, now living, are on a rampage. She flees her household, and finds the streets, and society in chaos. She runs into Kenneth (Ving Rhames) a Cop who is bloodied and has already fought his way out of some tight pinches. They along with some other survivors, decided to try and seek refuge in a closed mall. There they meet other survivors as they try and turn the Macy's like atmosphere into the Alamo, trying to ward off the always hungry zombies. The characters are pretty stock, the African American, the Security Officer, the slut. The two that stand out are the kind, smart, pragmatic Michael (Well Played by Jake Weber), and the ultra sleazy, rich playa type play by Modern Family's Ty  Burrell. He is so good at being snake like, that you are happy when let's just say he \"transforms.\" I realize that this is a remake, but since I never saw the original, I don't feel necessary to comment on the difference. If you can get the DVD, even better, since the bonus includes fantastic fake news broadcasts. I am confident you will enjoy this.",

I love the cast, and because of the setting you are forced to stick with them and you begin to dig for the good characters and then hope the assholes get butchered spectacularly, and they do, although it's always movie nature to kill of a few of the nice guys just to annoy you! The cast are outstanding, Ving Rhames is badass as usual and Sarah Polley is a fine lead as her character attempts to keep the others grounded, and Ty Burrell is a dirty and mean bastard which is a complete change from his sweet guy Phil in Modern Family.

I may be alone in this but the fast zombies who find it far easier to chase you down and rip your insides out are far scarier than a slow moving zombie who you could easily outrun in the real, sensible world. Throw on top of that a good soundtrack and a bit of preaching about the state of humanity in the face of a crisis and you have overall a very slick, smart film.

            "content": "This amped-up remake of the Romero classic adds more excitement, a more intricate story, and a bit more added scare to the overall zombie subgenre. However, the movie remake also comes with a few deeply recognizable flaws. \n\nPLOT:The Earth has officially been taken over by a zombie breakout and is rapidly getting worse. The last two remaining that we focus on the most are Ana (Sarah Polley) and Kenneth (VIng Rhames). To flee and find shelter from the undead, the two take shelter in an abandoned shopping mall, where they meet a mean group of security, including stubborn CJ (Michael Kelly) and several other survivors. After the outbreak starts getting worse, the group decides the best thing to do would be to sail to another island in hope of a safe zone. It's a good plot executed very well. \n\nACTING:The acting in this movie is alright. Some performances are pretty good and others really suck. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames were pretty okay as the main characters, Ana and Kenneth. Most of the other characters were just okay. The shiners would be Mekhi Phifer as Andre and Ty Burrell as Steve. The rest would be in the middle of okay and forgettable. \n\nSCORE:The score in here is pretty well done, with some good horror score and a few well-placed songs, such as Johnny Cash's \"The Man Comes Around\" and Richard Cheese's cover of \"Down With the Sickness\". I enjoyed it altogether. \n\nEFFECTS:The effects in this movie are kind of cheesy, but they also get the job of being scary done. The effects assist with the scares being effective altogether. Compared to the original, these effects are more charged and violent. Both are good nevertheless. \n\nOTHER CONTENT:This fueled remake of the classic is actually almost as good as it is or even better. The energy in this movie is way more charged and in-your-face as compared to the older one, which is a bit more subtly creepy. The constant action goes together with the creepiness in this one and kind of draws it all in together. However, some of the directions this movie decides to go in seem a bit cheesy and overdone. I believe for zombie films, there is a fine line between good substance and overdone cheese. This movie crossed back and forth over that line several times, but still worked it all out together in a way. One thing I also didn't like is that the characters in this seem more forgettable and less complex than they did in the first one. I couldn't really place as many people as I could before. \n\nOVERALL,a good zombie movie with a very well done plot, okay acting, well-placed score, cheesy yet scary effects, more action, and a few more independent scares, but there are forgettable characters and a few overdone sequences.",

The first 15 minutes of this movie are terrifying, but it slowly loses its steam for a small portion of the movie, then it gets back on track.  Another thing too were the TV broadcasts from the movie, which still haunt me to this day, with he whole, \"When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth\" speach.  The rest of the movie wasn't necessarily scary, but the mounting suspense was great.  The ending was sorta BS, but the credits left me shaking.

With that said, I thought the story was good, but not without its plotholes. It starts out okay, but a little cliched. But the film's pace really takes a nitro boost after 10-15 minutes. We have this one girl, whose name I can't remember, finding his boyfriend, and all around her, to have fallen victim to some strange undead plague. She flees, and comes across a few other people. They find the only safe place in town: the mall. Here, they do whatever they can to survive. They seal themselves completely from the outside. However, some security guards are also hiding, and they apparently don't like to share the place ith the others. \nMost of the characters present start out promising. We have something of each kind, all giving more contrasts to the story and how events turn out. There is some character development, but not much. Most characters are by the end carboards or cliched, with a few exceptions. Therefore, I cared less and less as the film went by if they were gonna make it or not. \n\nThe story is very good. Now, I am not a sucker for movies like thses, mostly because they usually suck hard. But this one brought some surprisingy emotional moments to the screen. However, as time goes by and they kill time in the mall, it gets pretty silly at times.\n\nAs for the pacing, I felt this was a nonstop, often surprisingly intense film. I am not sure if it was meant to be a scary film, but I was never once scared. at all. SO I enjoyed it more as an action film. But I really liekd how they didn't just shove as many undeads as possible into almost every shot in the film, but took it's time to tell a decent story. It certainly was entertainng, and worth wathcing a few more times.\n\nHowever, this ultimately feels like an extended spin-off episode of The Walking Dead, only more silly",

Despite being a remake, the movie never follows the exact same blueprint storyline of the original, and the effectiveness in there deserved praises. The movie is directed by Zack Snyder and stars Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Jake Weber. The film is both a financial and critical success.\r\n\r\n'I miscalculated!' is possibly the right phrase to define myself upon watching this good film, and yes it is true that I am startled. In the world of horror remakes, the film outshines. Very rare for a horror remake to be at least just good but this Snyder's film is fast paced, tight and gripping, and the storyline flows like a clean, clear fluid. I'm not trying to disrespect the original version of the movie but the remake here is much scarier and the zombies are much more frightening. Snyder's direction for the film is a bit different than Romero's but it is still effective, and the film too contains some fine performances from the leads.\r\n\r\nSome of the disappointments could be due from some of the characters being undeveloped or from the plot being simple or empty-headed. The idea for a comparison between the original and remake of Dawn of the Dead will always be there or everlasting, but who cares, this film is good.\r\n\r\n[2/4]",

They show you just about everything when it comes to the destruction of the zombies. It is not for the weak of heart. \r\n\r\nThe special effects, and make-up effects are incredible. I have a feeling that when it first came out, it made a good chunk of the audience squirm in their theater seats. They spent a lot of money on the special effects and make-up, and that's a good thing for a movie of this kind. \r\n\r\nYou can pretty much tell who will make it to the closing credits at the end of the movie because those people have the most development. Some have very little development, and are killed early on, while others make it to about three-quarters of the way through. \r\n\r\nAnother thing that this movie does well is the action. When the zombies attack, there is no time for the characters they are after or the audience to breathe. A good chunk of the movie takes place in the shopping mall, with the zombies trying to break in to get to the main cast, so there isn't action every five minutes. \r\n\r\nThe development of the main cast was pretty good. It wasn't perfect, but you understood each character's motives as the movie went on. \r\n\r\nOne of the things I didn't like was the \"Andy\" (Bruce Bohne) character. He spent most of the movie on the roof of a building near the shopping mall, and communicated with the main cast through a magic marker board. If you ask me, this character was not needed, as he did nothing for the movie. \r\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, it's all modern music with instrumental pieces used to enhance the scare factor, sometimes in a really good way. \r\n\r\nIf you have a weak stomach, don't see this movie. And do not let young kids see this one. The violence factor is extreme and the imagery is even more graphic.",

Zack Snyder gives DAWN OF THE DEAD a terrifying new update in his 2004 remake, changing the game of zombie cinema forever.\n\nIn an effort to make his villains even more frightening, Snyder allows the creatures to take off at top-speeds after our heroes. Now, we not only have to worry about the overwhelming numbers of the undead, but outrunning them as well! While this has become the source of much controversy with fans, it isn't as illogical as many make it out to be. The infection is only a day old when our movie begins, so the bodies of the deceased have had no chance to degenerate. If fueled by an insatiable bloodlust, it would only seem reasonable that these killing machines would attack with a primitive rage.\n\nOur new set of heroes quickly garner our support, with Ving Rhames playing the tough policeman Kenneth, Sarah Polley as the sharp and resourceful Ana, and Jake Weber trying to hold things together as Michael. Each of the side characters are just as enjoyable as well, and help to create a dichotomy in personal politics that drives the internal conflict. The human element is great, but where the new DAWN OF THE DEAD succeeds most is in the scares. Synder creates many unexpected and exhilarating moments of adrenaline-pumping excitement, pitting his characters against insurmountable odds in the fight to survive. The zombies are like rabid dogs, bursting through doors and ripping their victims to shreds. It is a very horrifying experience, but one that also delivers on suspense as well as gore.\n\nRegardless of one's feelings when it comes to the proper speed of a zombie, DAWN OF THE DEAD proves to be one of the strongest remakes in Horror to come out of the 2000's. It draws from Romero's basic premise, but creates something unique entirely that fans are sure to appreciate, but moreover, it is as scary as it is purely entertaining.",

            "content": "This film revisits the zombie-horror genre by making zombies far more menacing, dangerous and agile. The movie takes place most of the time inside a shopping Mall where a number of survivors find refuge. Contrary to the original 'Dawn of the Dead, 1978' the survivors are more numerous since after a while new people arrive to take shelter. Communication with a lone survivor across the street through signals also makes the film less claustrophobic and the monotony of fear is occasionally interrupted by a number of funny moments.\n\nThe film has a strong post-apocalyptic feel in it since we get the impression that the zombie condition is not supernatural (or at least not totally unexplained) but may have to do with an epidemic spread from some unknown to us virus agent. It is no coincidence that the main protagonist (Sarah Polley) works as a nurse in a hospital and witnesses first-hand some curious symptoms. In some respects the film has some similarities with the beginning of Stephen King's 'The Stand' where survivors also have to avoid the initial epidemic onslaught and the 'Omega Man' based on the excellent novel 'I am Legend' of Richard Matheson. In contrast to these two latter books made-into films the present film depicts events occurring in a far shorter time frame: a few days.\n\nI thought the movie was quite good and added a number of new elements to the zombie filmography, paying homage to the original Romero's films but covering also new ground. It is clearly superior to a lot of zombie films of the past 30 years including the recent TV series 'The walking dead, 2010'. There was a lot of tension and realism, and the survivors were not just there to provide cheap scares; they were three-dimensional characters discussing the situation, contemplating their plans and trying to grasp the severity of what was happening. A good effort from Zack Snyder who later went on to direct '300' and the 'Watchmen'.",

Romero, Dawn of the Dead, Snyder completely abandons Romero's vision of satire and goes completely for the horror element of the original. Is this remake that loses the smart social commentary still able to deliver a fresh story? Hell yeah, it does! Dawn of the Dead is horrific in every way, with creepy zombies and great moments of suspense. The only real issue I have with the zombies in this film is how the zombies move. I'm okay with zombies that run, but I don't think that they need to book it to be scary. What makes zombies scary, in my opinion, is their numbers. Get enough of them to come after you, fast or slow, and you're screwed. Other than the zombies, our survivors make great performances as well. While there's nothing really Oscar-worthy in this film, Dawn of the Dead is a great horror movie to be seen. I wouldn't really compare this to the original because they're both completely different films. Just go with what you're about to watch, and you're in for a really good time!",

            "content": "An absolutely incredible reinvisioning of the greatest zombie horror film of all time. The forefront of the film has it's parallels to the 1978 Romero original without duplicating George's screenplay, such as the sense of consumerism and isolation. This film pushes the boundaries of \"horror\" films, it keeps the fun of the concept of the zombie genre while keeping a sense of seriousness. It's not campy or cheesy. The characters aren't at all clich\u00e9d or stupid, they are very real world and in depth people with great development and feeling. Yes it's gory and violent but it still steers clear of corny zombie clich\u00e9s. Ving Rhames delivers one of his few spectacular performances since Pulp Fiction, and a pre-300 Zack Snyder established himself as a phenomenal director with this truly wonderful film!",

But Zack Snyder was directing and he made some pretty good movies, so I decided to give it a try. I didn't  catch it in theaters but I got the unrated director's cut on dvd. Let me say, this is the best remake I think I've seen.... ever. I was so pleased with this movie but I wasn't as good as the original, that's not saying much though because it almost was better. So, meet Sarah, a hard working nurse, she's got a good life, good husband, nice house, life is good. Then everything changes and she's thrown into a zombie apocalypse. She flees her once peaceful neighborhood and soon finds other survivors, they take refuge inside a mall with survivors flooding in. So, life goes back to as normal as it can be, everyone makes friends and then things go sour. They soon have to fight the infected and try to make it somewhere safer. This movie is loaded with blood, zombie killing, babes, good story and acting. Thank you, Zack Snyder for a good movie and not dragging Dawn of the Dead through the mud like other remakes. So for this movie, I'm giving it a 5/5.",
