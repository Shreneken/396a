    "summary": "Years after his squad was ambushed during the Gulf War, Major Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) finds himself having terrible nightmares. He begins to doubt that his fellow squad-mate Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber), now a vice-presidential candidate, is the hero he remembers him being. As Marco's doubts deepen, Shaw's political power grows, and, when Marco finds a mysterious implant embedded in his back, the memory of what really happened begins to return.",

            "content": "This is a somewhat sinister film, with a relatively decent performance by Denzel Washington, although it didn't feel engrossing enough to fully grab my attention and I feel it missed something of substance but its hard to say quite what. The story is a sobering one - I can imagine people who may have been, shall we say tampered with, being regarded as paranoid but this isn't quite 'Men in Black' level, special effects wise or otherwise. The themes are obviously quite serious and not at all comedic really, especially in this day and age of unstable politics, I suppose. Indeed it has an element of the classic novel 1984 about it, I suppose. \n\nI felt there was perhaps an element of over acting at times, while at other times almost the opposite applied, in that there wasn't perhaps as much emotion expressed as I expected and not just down to the brainwashing aspect of the plot. However, I certainly wouldn't say the film is unwatchable - it features a decent cast with Meryl Streep, Jon Voight and Denzel Washington but I certainly wouldn't say its a particularly good film. It had/has potential and its ok but not great, so overall I wouldn't especially recommend it, no, although its certainly a thought provoking film.",

There is a tension all the way through (a trait of truly great thrillers) that never loses its riveting power. Taut, tense, and terrific",

            "content": "My 2022 goal to see all Meryl Streep movies continues.  My most recent flick is The Manchurian Candidate.  This is a 2004 remake of the 1962 film based on the novel of the same name.\nThe story revolves around a group of Gulf War veterans who are unaware that they were subjected to experimentation and brainwashing during their time in service.  The purpose of this experimentation is to turn them into unknowing sleeper agents for forces bent on political and global domination. \nMajor Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) is becoming cognizant of what happened to him and is working to discover the full extend of what he was subjected to\u2026 and why.   One of his former service mates is Congressman Raymond Prentiss Shaw (Liev Schreiber).  Raymond is the son of Senator Eleonor Prentiss Shaw (Meryl Streep), a ruthlessly ambitious politician who is working to ensure her son becomes the next candidate for Vice President of the United States.\nThe acting is extremely good all the way around, but Schreiber stands out as the smarmy child of privilege who's private and public personas are so at odds with each other.  I give credit to director Jonathan Demme for altering and updating enough of the story to make it interesting to those who might have seen the classic original.  This film keeps you guessing despite its iconic and well-known plot. \nThis is a solid film and one well worth seeing if good suspense is something you enjoy.  But if pressed to choose between this version or the original, the original wins hands down.",

Nevertheless, money and power are those peoples' gods and they were the gods of the people in the film too. A few questions seemed to go unanswered though: was Raymond Shaw supposed to be a democrat? And his mother was a republican? They tried hard not to give any of that away, although the diagram of the polling of the states seemed to indicate my guess was correct. Also, why was Capt. Marco so quick to shoot down Huey's with what looked to be special forces assaulters in them? Nevertheless, no real complaints.

The opening is action packed and gets our attention, but after that for the first half of the movie it is a little slow, and confusing.  It's understandable, as out main character is also confuse and looking for answers, but we don't really know what's going on, and have many question.  Luckly as the movie moves on all these are answered, and it becomes quite interesting.   It's complex, and is more psychological than anything else, which is an interesting change from what we usually see.  I find my self wondering how much of this is actually possible, as the brainwashing and probes put in their bodies, seem a little too futuristic.  The movie is well done however, with some great preformances by the actors, good cinematography and good script.  However I find there to be too many twists that aren't for the better, friends of characters who turn out to be special agents, other clich\u00c3 (C)s, and a confusing first half, which all brings down my rating, which could be at 8/10 instead, but dosen't quite reach it. The ending was good, however I saw it coming before it happened, but then was caught off guard.  I was pleased to see some change from most movie endings, until it brought our main character back to life after we thought he was dead.  OF COURSE this had to happen, it wonder how long it will take before directors stop pulling the same crappy move.   Anyway the movie was pretty good, but has all the clich\u00c3 (C)s and already overused events of other movies involving governments, agents, and brainwashing.   Could have been better, but still a decent film.",

The original was a political thriller, but it was also a sophisticated satire deriding political ideologues. Demme's version doesn't have the fortitude to be funny or political, least of all entertaining. It's quite telling that no political party is represented here. Liev Schreiber has the appropriate stoicism without the mystery of the Lawrence Harvey role; Denzel Washington is limited in the Frank Sinatra role; Meryl Streep plays the Angela Lansbury part as an obvious, transparently sinister villain; Kimberly Elise is terrible in the Janet Leigh role. Demme opts for a more hopeful ending that is a major miscalculation. Slickly directed by Demme without the distorted visuals from the John Frankenheimer version. It's despairing to watch an original talent like Demme wasted on material better suited for a hack. Daniel Pyne and Dean Georgaris adapted the Richard Condon novel.

It was well reviewed, and it was suspenseful as hell, and certainly well acted, but it's similarity to the source material is something akin to Hawkeye's \"Bourne Legacy\" to original Ludlum novel.\n\n[PARAGRAPH INDENT] I'm not a purist. I'm really not. In fact, I think it's somewhat pretentious when people scoff at well made cinema because in the books the character had red hair or some such. I understand perfectly that (and this book is an excellent example) certain shorthands must be made. But in this case it didn't work.\n\n[PARAGRAPH INDENT] Without giving spoilers, there's a reason why the novel was great. There's a theme in there that sheds a light on the society of the time (1950s). There's a motive that stands out other than just raw, naked power and money cloaked in a lot of newscast voiceovers. Johnny Iselin is what makes the book, and he's completely cut from the film. Moreover, the politics are so bland in the film as to render the entire conspiracy moot. The politics were strong in the book. Here, you've got Raymond and Jon Voight's characters positions being virtually identical, which makes you wonder what the point of a coup d'etat is. And it completely cuts out the communist connection for this backdrop of the War on Terror and some corporate conspiracy, and renders \"Manchuria\" nothing more than a brand name.\n\n[PARAGRAPH INDENT] It is a decent movie, and I do like Denzel Washington, and I think Liev Schrieber is great here, but it's probably best watched without having read the novel.",

Here he portrays an emotionally and spiritually wounded career Army officer with just the right note of humanity, confusion, and terror. He reacts and navigates through a (frighteningly) plausible scenario where the wheels have come off his world. The leaders and structure he had grown up trusting and serving have revealed themselves to be the real evil, the enemy we should all fear. Meryl Streep, another great actor, was spookily terrifying as 'Mother', the devil incarnate.The movie entertained, enthralled, and thrilled me at every turn. Further, the object lesson and cautionary tale it delivers makes this required viewing for everyone in the UK, the US, and the world. It is not a strict roman a clef, but it also wasn't hard to see many of our current leaders' actions and behaviors mirrored in the villainous plots\"The Manchurian Candidate\" is good on its own. , it is well directed, and its subject has been made timely.However, I do have a problem with the film. My problem is with the title. I believe the only reason it is titled \"The Manchurian Candidate\" was to benefit from the aura and popularity of the original 1962 film. In the new film it is a different war, a different era, a different manipulative international force, a different method of control, and more than one assassin. The way they managed to include the name \"Manchurian\" in this movie was a real stretch. I think it would have been far better and more honest to title it \"The Corporate Candidate,\" or some name that fit this particular film.",

It's sort of a political thriller sprinkled with just enough creepiness and mystery to make it consistently interesting. Meryl Streep gives a fantastic performance as Liev Schreiber's sinister, conspiring mother and the primary antagonist of the movie. Schreiber is also great as a young senator and Gulf War veteran who is mind-controlled as part of a far-reaching political conspiracy. The story becomes a little muddled in the ending, but everything leading up to it is thrilling and very enjoyable. It's imperfect, but Jonathan Demme's The Manchurian Candidate has a lot to offer in terms of excitement and entertainment, and that's more than enough to make it a worthwhile movie to watch.",

A solid political thriller with powerful performances, and a lot of style. \r\n\r\nThe Story: Raymond Shaw single handedly saves his army unit in the gulf war, and becomes a vice presidential nominee years later. A fellow soldier, Ben Marco, begins to dream of the incident that got Raymond his war hero status, tension builds as Bens dreams become more realistic than his memories. The clock is ticking as he desperately tries to find the answers to all the questions that have surfaced from his recurring nightmares...Okay, I hope that was a decent synopsis. I had a hell of a time trying to figure out just how to word the story for this film for some reason...So, I apologize if it wasn't good enough for you...And if it's not good enough, than that's more of a personal problem for you than me.... Below looks like a big empty space, but it's actually another version of my synopsis. It includes a spoiler though, so if you don't want to read it, just scroll keep scrolling down.\r\n\r\n******************************SPOILER**************\r\n**************SPOILER******************************\r\n***********************SPOILER*********************\r\n*********SPOILER***********************************\r\n*************************SPOILER*******************\r\n************************************SPOILER********\r\nA military unit is kidnapped and brainwashed during the Gulf War. They're hypnotized and conditioned into thinking that one man, Raymond Shaw, single handedly saved them during an attack on the unit. Years pass and Shaw has followed in his fathers and more importantly his mothers footsteps and turned into a respected politician, and becomes a nominee for vice-president. When other soldiers of his unit begin to dream about the incedent, a massive political conspiracy unfolds....Was that one any better? Well, between the two of them you should be able to make some sense of things... \r\n\r\n***************************************************\r\n***************************************************\r\n***************************************************\r\n***************************************************\r\n***************************************************\r\n\r\nThe Cast: Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber...These two have more power than you can possibly believe. And that's important in a film all about power. Denzel Washington delivers one of his best performances here, playing naive, intelligent, and a little bit crazy all at the same time. If you weren't a fan before than prepare to be a fan after you see this because he's that good here. Liev Schreiber is perhapse one of the most underated actors ever. He's been in a ton of movies, but ya know what? I haven't seen more than 3 of them. And I really wish I'd seen more because he's amazing. Giving an Oscar calibur performance as Raymond Shaw. He plays childlike and athoratative at the same time. Demanding power but being controlled at the same time is something a lot of actors only wish they could do successfully. These two bring this film to life like no other. You won't be dissapointed by either one, I guarantee it. \r\n\r\nOne to Five Scale: 4 \r\n\r\nIt's undeniably stylish, with a lot of bright light and contrasting colors, this film simply looks amazing. It's a solid political thriller, with powerfull performances. There's a few things that seem a little confusing to me even after multiple views, a couple of characters that play integral parts don't have much backstory and it shows, mainly Bens german friend...Maybe I just missed something but it lost me a couple of times. A definite must-see for any fan of Washington or Schreiber. \r\n\r\nTyler",

If it wasn't for the cast, the film definitely wouldn't have the same effect, as the cast here are well chosen in their respective roles and are perfect in the parts they play. This is a good thriller, but is nothing really excellent. The film does have an entertaining story, which is engaging, however it lacks something really special to make this film memorable. The performances, like I stated is what really makes this film worth seeing, and above all makes the film interesting for the viewer. The Manchurian Candidate is better than what most people may think, and is a good remake for what it is, but of course it does not beat the original. Director Jonathan Demme delivers a good thriller with this remake even though it's not perfect, the film does deliver and entertaining two hours. I think that the film is underrated and was quite good considering that this is a remake. The cast like I said were great, and is one of the key aspects as to why the film works. There are things that could have been improved upon, but for the most part, this remake of the classic Manchurian Candidate is good enough entertainment for anyone looking for a good thriller.

The movie follows a major in the US Army as he tries to piece together the events of a pivotal night in Kuwait in '91. Viewers get to see some of what happens in an opening scene: a group of soldiers is ambushed at night, and then... Denzel describes the heroics of Schreiber's character, now a congressman and a recipient of the Medal of Honor for single-handedly fighting off the enemy and guiding the team through hostile terrain. But did that really happen? As Denzel investigates, Meryl Streep chews the scenery as a super-tough senator aiming to place her son (Schreiber's war hero character, what a concidence!) as the candidate for vice president in the elections. It's really gripping stuff, and the film has choice themes for nerds like me: the fallibility of memory, corruption and science, power and humanity, and let's not forget nepotism and the Oedipus Complex. Yuck.\r\n\r\nBut the real reason you should watch the remake of The Manchurian Candidate is to play a drinking game called, \"Is Liev Schreiber Constipated?\" The game works like this: every time he cracks a smile--\r\n\r\n--take 1 sip if his character is clearly undergoing emotional turmoil;\r\n--take 2 sips if his character is clearly in physical pain;\r\n--take 3 sips if his character is clearly trying to be charming;\r\n--take a swig if his character is clearly constipated;\r\n--chug if you can't tell the difference.\r\n\r\nYou'll be drunk and a better conversationalist in no time!",

The extras in the background, the tv analysts and news correspondents, the music that was played during the victory speeches, tv ads,,,, it was all just too damn corny to me and that was probably Jonathan Demme's direct intent. To show US political candidates as puppets on a string, smiling for the cameras, and in the pockets and control of the corporate dollar. \n\nThe cool thing about this movie, other than a crazy, bi-polar Denzel Washington, AAANNNND, other than Jon Voight getting dumped and drowned in the water, is the concept. The idea that a corporation could have that much power and influence to brainwash, assassinate, and control our political leaders. They've already kind of done that and they already kind of do! \n\nStill: The original Manchurian Candidate spooked the hell out of me, years ago. I remember watching that movie thinking how could a black and white film keep me on the edge of my seat like this!?! in 2004, Denzel is the black Frank Sinatra, but the remake is not on the same shelf as the original. There really aren't many that are. A worthy attempt nonetheless, and definitely entertaining enough to be worth the watch.",

            "content": "An Attempted Update That Falls Flat  \r\n\r\nThe thing is, this movie starts with an unnecessary cover of a classic song and launches into an unnecessary remake of a classic movie.  It changes most of what made the original so powerful by trying to tap into modern fears instead, only I don't think it quite gets what we fear right.  The kind of paranoid crazies who talk of various modern politicians as Manchurian Candidates--I suspect they haven't actually watched either movie--think the corporations already control the government anyway.  The idea that you need mind control devices instead of fat sacks of cash money is laughable to those people.  Though some of them think they're all reptilian shapeshifting aliens anyway.  (I wish I were making that up.)  The main reason the original worked was the Cold War.  And, you know, character development, which is the other thing this movie tossed overboard.  Because if we have Denzel Washington, we don't need character development, and Liev Schreiber and Meryl Streep are always kind of creepy anyway.\r\n\r\nAs with the original, we start with Captain Bennet Marco, who this time is Denzel Washington.  Over ten years earlier, he was part of the famous Lost Patrol in Kuwait.  He was knocked unconscious at the beginning of the action, and the lives of all but two of his men were saved by Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Schreiber), given the Medal of Honor for his bravery and so forth.  And now, Shaw is a congressman from New York and Marco is having bad dreams.  Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright), who was also in that patrol, tells Shaw that he is having the dreams as well and then dies, I didn't quite catch how.  This inspires Marco to dig deeper into what is happening with Shaw, whose mother (Streep) engineers for him to become the Vice Presidential nominee.  Only, as with the original, Shaw has been engineered to run the country a certain way and for the benefit of shadowy people working behind the scenes.  The difference being what people and for what purpose.  And this time, Marco doesn't have the benefit of the US military on his side, and he and Shaw are the only two men of the Lost Patrol left alive.\r\n\r\nIt's all a little too confused this time.  The rest of the men are dead because they'd take focus away from the main characters, I think, and no one seems to have considered the idea of maybe testing the Secret Mind Control Program in a less public way first.  And we know it's their first test, because they don't know that it doesn't work perfectly.  They don't know that it will leak through in dreams.  But the scientist who is head of the project (Simon McBurney) worked in South Africa previously, and apparently no one knew he was doing this level of unsavoury work.  No word of it leaked to anyone, apparently.  I suppose it was easier to take the men while on combat missions in Kuwait, but I'd also say that the deaths of the two men murdered during the brainwashing procedure make less sense.  The brainwashing as a whole comes across as pretty erratic--I assume the implants in the shoulders were decoys for the ones in the brains, but there are parts of that which don't make sense, either.\r\n\r\nPossibly the aspect of the story which is most telling about the differences forty-plus years will make is that Bennett Marco goes from being well-connected, supported by the military, to being an outcast who's told to take his drugs.  (I note that they call him bipolar at one point, while his behaviour would be more symptomatic of schizophrenia.)  The woman (Kimberly Elise) goes from being a mystery figure to being an FBI agent.  And Marco must fight against her at first, too.  Those who know The Truth (TM) are thought crazy and must fight to get anyone to listen to them.  No evidence which would convince anyone is brought forward, but we know Our Hero is right, because he is Our Hero and can't simply be crazy.  Even though, if we looked at it from the outside and didn't know he was Denzel Washington, he really would look schizophrenic.  They have converted one character, who was intelligent and resourceful in the original, into a raving lunatic who is unable to present anything coherent, merely ravings.  Another is personable but ultimately appears crazy as well.  But he must be right, because he stands up to The Man.\r\n\r\nI did not, I must admit, go into this movie expecting to like it much.  This is not just because I don't like Meryl Streep, though of course I don't.  I quite like Liev Schreiber, for all he is persistently creepy even when I'm not sure he's supposed to be, and that balances out my dislike of her.  But when I saw the original last week, I was blown away.  I really think it was a masterpiece.  There was, I thought, no need to remake the thing.  I'll admit it could have been used to cast a new light on how the world has changed, but I didn't expect that would actually happen.  And, indeed, it did try and fail.  I think the problem is that Cold War paranoia was actually at least a little more rational.  Oh, I said and maintain that Communism was a Red Herring in the original.  However, I think it was at least a fear the average person had, and I think it was an obvious and rational fear to a certain extent.  Whereas this?  Conspiracy theories and no more or better.",

Maybe something totally awesome happened at the end that would have changed my opinion of the film, but I doubt it. \n\nFrom what I did see, this version of The Manchurian Candidate seems like a weak remake of the original, which I also watched recently (all the way through, I might add). A few major plot points have been altered:\n--This film takes place in the present day, and Shaw and his platoon fought in the first Iraq War, not the Korean War.\n--In the original, Shaw's stepfather was vying for the Vice Presidential nomination in the party running against Presidential nominee Tom Jordan. In the remake, Shaw himself runs for Vice President on the same ticket as Jordan.\n--In the original, plain, old-fashioned brainwashing was used to get Shaw to do what the bad guys wanted. In the remake, nanotechnology (i.e. a chip implanted in the brain) was used. And from what I saw, they left the solitaire trigger completely out of it. No solitaire in The Manchurian Candidate?! Blasphemy.\n\nThese changes could have, theoretically, made for an interesting update. But something about the film seemed to be trying too hard. The acting is also subpar. In the original, Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury disappeared into their roles as tormented ex-army man and evil, calculating stage mother. Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep's portrayals of the same characters scream \"acting!\" They never once become anything other than Denzel and Meryl. Liev Schrieber is decent, if boring, as Shaw.\n\nIn conclusion, the remake is no match for the original Marchurian Candidate, which had an air of atmospheric dread to it. The remake, to me, had very little atmosphere at all.",

Honestly - and I hate to say this, because I pretty much loathe anything political involving Meryl Streep (Evening) - this is the better film.  Sure, having Liev Schreiber (Salt) try to fill Laurence Harvey's big shoes was tough, but Denzel Washington (The Book of Eli) fills Frank Sinatra's quite well - regardless of any affirmative action at work.  However, even though I'm pretty sure Streep has her own Communist tendencies, she doesn't own the role of Shaw's estrogenically tyrannical mother the way Angela Lansbury did.  Plus, the filmmakers tried to re-imagine her as a corporate hack rather than a Commie.  Don't get me wrong, she channels Hillary Clinton quite well, but not to the diabolical level of Lansbury in the original.  Still, it's not as blasphemous - that is, anti-McCarthy - as the original, and thereby a bit more enjoyable.  It still has some political commentary, but it's more of a thriller than a preachy political movie.",

Leaving comparisons with the original or the book aside, The Manchurian Candidate stands alone as an entertaining tale of  political subterfuge and post-war paranoia. Washington plays Ben Marco, an Iraqi war veteran piecing together fragments of his lost memory - against the backdrop of an election campaign. The election features a distinguished member of his old company (Schreiber) running for office with his controlling mother (Streep) obsessed with her son's rise to power. Despite his honorable veteran status - Marco suffers post-war syndrome to the point where his career involves giving pro-army talks to youth groups. At one of these well-rehearsed meetings he encounters a former soldier from his command - making strange, seemingly paranoid claims at odds with reality. Slowly, Marco realises that a life defining moment from his memory - may not be his memory at all - casting serious doubts on the character and poilitical aspirations of Schreiber.\n\nThe cast are mostly great (with a good supporting role from John Voight - getting a chance to recreate 'Delieverance' for a scene - thankfully not involving squealing pigs or Ned Beatty) and the pacing is solid. The story doesn't stray too far into the fantastic to lose the audience (although one meeting scene between Schreiber & Washington goes probably goes too far), and the story builds to a thrilling climax. Washington enshews Marco with a good balance of honor, desperation and fragility. Schreiber's ill-at-ease core beneath the political sheen is well realised if a little under-written, while Streep is very good as his obsessive mother. \n\nThere are a couple of loose ends which aren't tied up, perhaps deliberately so to leave the audience uneasy, but given how the plot plays out - they leave some questions unanswered. There are some other characters who appear too briefly in the movie and perhaps not enough mileage wrung from the potential paranoia. We don't get to see too enough of the figures behind the conspiracy - or those who stand to gain from it, so it's difficult to feel any sense of triumph or defeat when the story ends, or see how profoundly the outcome affects these shadowy figures.\n\nThat being said If the Manchurian Candidate is standing, I'll vote yes.",

This is not a two hour plus movie but that's not her fault. I know-I know. I'm always complaining about that. It's like that father who goes to his kid's basketball game yelling \"THREE SECONDS!\" on like every possetion. Really, though, do we need to watch Denzel eat his noodles? Cut the Rosie character. Cut the Joseline character. Cut. Cut. Cut. We've already got Meryl Streep. We can't pin any of those decisions on her. Her son \"Raymond\" on the other hand...only a mother can screw a guy up like that. There's a difference between a man who forgets where he placed his keys and a man who forgets what his keys are for. The trick is to know which one you're dealing with.\r\n\r\nThe movie isn't about the Meryl Streep character but I made it so. Despite what she says, I don't think it's about her being a \"True Believer.\" I think it's much simpler than that. I think it's about power. She tasted a little of it and she wants more. How much more? She wants it all. \"Eleanor Prentiss\" is an example of an evil person not knowing she's evil. Arguably, that's wickedness in it's worst form (e.g. Hitler). Overall, the Manchurian Candidate tries to take on too much. Hand in the cookie jar. We expect to see a film about mind control but all that gets lost in the politics. A fancy mess. Thumb down.   \r\n\r\n\"Somebody got into our heads with big steel-toe boots, cable cutters, and a chainsaw and they went to town. neurons got exposed and circuits got rewired.

Tweaked a little bit from the original in terms of ending and what's going on, but does a good job trading Cold War paranoia for War on Terror era similar setting.  Well done by director Demme.

In the original, the focus was on Raymond, and the decision to reverse this changes the feel and gives the remake a new take on the story, but it has the added difficulty of being a much harder plot device to handle.  The remake beats the original in one major way though: Denzel's casting choice.  He is superb as usual.  However, Streep is a pale imitation of Lansbury, both less ruthless and dumber to boot.  And perhaps the biggest flaw, Liev Schreiber simply doesn't have enough to work with; he feels constrained in every scene he's in, and the love plot with the senator's daughter might as well not be there (though it was sorely underdeveloped in the original as well).  He was at the center of the original, being both unwitting, innocent, conflicted, and sympathetic.  Here, you barely get any of that, which is a shame because it pushes through every so often.  Finally, the political bent is tougher to incorporate than in the original; that one focused on McCarthyism while here it's big business, government, and the Middle East all rolled into one.  I'm actually impressed at how multilayered the whole thing ends up being, yet pissed because it feels rushed and rough around the edges.

The Manchurian Candidate is a maddeningly intense science-fiction/political genre mash thats brutally disturbing, completely unflinching and incredibly gripping throughout.  Widely acclaimed Director Jonathan Demme (The Silence Of The Lambs) is back in charge, and he delivers yet another spectacularly bizarre psycholgical thriller.  This guy knows how to mess with your head, and does so in his own kind of strangely trademarked way.  The Manchurian Candidate grabs you from the beginning and really takes ahold of you for 2 hours of fantastically trippy, utterly bizarre, downright volatile, searingly gripping and purely entertaining madness that will leave you completely brain-washed.  It's a one-two punch of wickedly riveting concepts and surrealistic implausibilties, it's a cerebral roller coaster ride to the land of government conspiracies, science fiction brain-washing, Desert Storm and high government.  Sound strange?  It is folks!  But it's a damn good watch, guaranteed to entertain, but not recommended for the faint of heart.\n        Jonathan Demme and company put together an all-star cast for this one.  Denzel Washington lights up the screen in an absolutely brilliant performance.  Liev Schreiber dishes out his best role.  Meryl Streep shows why she is one of the elite actresses of our time.

One glimpse of black and white, and funky old clothes, and most teenyboppers under the age of thirty are out the door. Since they would only sit through a first run update, it's truly fine that they have one. The wonder is, the update stands up to the original.\nIt even solves some of the problems of the first. Gone are the vaguely foreign looking actors standing in for Russians and Chinese agents. Gone are the poorly choreographed ju-jitsu moves.\nAnd the new film retains the strengths of the original. Every performance is fine. Liev Schrieber is worthy of Laurence Harvey's original gut kicking performance. Washington's craft is more than a match for Sinatra's unevenly inspired work. Streep's scenery chewing is frankly, perfect, because unfortunately, really disgusting people actually do exist, and the real ones are impervious to the critique that their behavior is over-the-top. Streep's Senator may be over-the-top, but the only thing that distinguishes her from the real thing is - surprise - she's only acting.\nMake no mistake, both these films are paranoid thrillers, and the overly literal would say of either, \"preposterous\". But then, the overly literal don't usually get much out of anything that isn't underlined in Business Week with a magic marker. \nThe film's style is less dialog laden, it runs more on mood.

This 2004 version, helmed by 'Silence of the Lambs' director Jonathan Demme and starring Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, and Meryl Streep, replaces the Korean War with the 1991 Gulf War and the communist Chinese with a corporate conglomerate called Manchurian Global.

            "content": "I have never seen the original version of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" by John Frankenheimer. I found out the setting was different (original was made in 1962), and the villain. This version seemed more real and possible, but still very sinister. Instead of Red Chinese Villains from the original, director Jonathan Demme uses corporate villains. \r\n\r\nI will not write this review as a comparison with the original for two reasons. The first obviously because I haven't seen the orignal. Second because I found out that even though the premise is the same, it was still quite different and many critics found it irrelevant. \r\n\r\nThe premise is that Sen. Elanor Shaw has sold out her soul to the Manchurian Global Corp. Being a very influential mother and figure, she pushes her son Raymond Shaw (Liev Schreiber) into the vice president candidacy. With a chip implanted to his skull, Raymond is controlled like a puppet by the Manchurian. The point is to make him the \"first privately owned and operated vice president of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAll goes well, until two men try to make sense of their nightmares. These are Ben Marco (Denzel Washington) and Al Melvin (Jeffrey Wright). They are the two men who served in the Gulf War and are part of the team that was saved by Sgt. Shaw, who was awarded the Medal of Honor - thus starting his political career. The question that is asked is did Shaw really save their lives and deserve the Medal of Honor? This question really does keep us intrigued by the movie and is a real hook.\r\n\r\nBen Marco goes out to find out more about his nightmares. He finds out that all of his team use identical words to describe what happened in the war - as if they were told to say it. Shaw admits to Marco for remembering that the events happened, but not remembering that he actually did it. He has a hint that they were all brainwashed by the Manchurian to believe Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor. \r\n\r\nThe lead-up to the ending is tense and very well told. Demme already tells the audience that the soldiers were brainwashed by the Manchurian from early in the film. We know what they are trying to accomplish. But another figure rises to take control and the ending is very unexpected. \r\n\r\nThere has been numerous comparisons between Meryl Streep's interpretation of Mrs. Shaw and Sen. Hilary Clinton. I saw a slight similarity, but she has cited a few other political figures. Washington does an electrifying job as Marco, seeming disturbed, but not quite that - just confused and eager. Liev Schreiber does a good job as well, but Streep and Washington just chewed the screen.\r\n\r\nWe also wonder a lot of things relating to what happens on screen. Like when a woman named Rosie (Kimberly Elise) shows love interest to a obviously troubled Marco, why is she persistent on keeping in touch with him, and later accommodates him? There is also a great level of realistic conspiracy that you can relate directly to reality. It is brave of Demme to apply this to the movie; and ultimately succeed. Because of \"The Manchurian Candidate\", we have a lot to worry about the national security anywhere, and our own. \r\n\r\n3 out of 4 stars",

            "content": "Inevitably dragged to the chopping block for being (gasp!) a remake of a deservedly classic thriller, Jonathan Demme's take on The Manchurian Candidate is a great film in its own right. Just as bizarre in a contemporary context as its predecessor was 50 years ago, Demme is not afraid to take risks with this film. His protagonist is a mumbling, slurred mess, played with a surprising clarity by Denzel Washington. Washington effectively conveys that the mystery always seems to be at the tip of his fingers, its answer lurking in his brain, and that makes the movie's increased focus on him really pay off. Meryl Streep is reliably dynamic as the reimagined Ms. Shaw/Iselin, though I do think she pales a little bit next to Angela Lansbury's interpretation. Where Streep is an immediate elemental force to all who meet her, talking and walking like a regular news pundit, Lansbury gave her character a creeping insidiousness that made her all the more evil. The one person who I didn't really care for is Liev Schreiber. I cannot buy him as a political power player, even with Streep pulling the strings; he looks too weaselly and hard-faced to kindle any sort of public affection. I think there was a little bit of shadiness going on in the casting of this movie (note also that his brother got an admittedly small part), and even though he is technically sufficient, there are so many other actors who could have done this part better.\n\nTo be honest, I really only remember the fundamental's of the original's plot. This film is unwaveringly faithful to those roots while unabashedly modernizing much of the in-between; I feel that many of the people who dislike this remake don't hate it because of the technique or content, but simply out of sacred-cow closed-mindedness. This film makes a good case for the argument that, ultimately, a remake is still its own movie, no matter how closely it follows or how much it deviates from the one that came before it. Perhaps this was only greenlighted to make money - stranger things have happened in Hollywood - but Demme clearly cared about the product he was making here. It is uncynical and creative and generally exciting to watch, even if you already know the outcome. Definitely recommended, as long as you keep a fair perspective on things.",

Denzel Washinton plays Major Bennet Marco - a soldier who is experiencing severe psychological effects after returning from the Gulf War in Kuwait in 1991. Millitary officials in the US dismiss it as Gulf War syndrome but Marco is not convinced. Marco uncovers a sinister plot that involves illegal and top secret millitary research,  corrupt senators and a multi-million dollar corporation: Manchurian Global supplying funds to the research. The movie explores themes of corruption and absolute power and what people will do to obtain absolute power. Directd by Jonathan Demme who gave us 'The silence of the lambs' and 'Philadelphia'. This movie is  a spine chilling and disturbing political thriller with solid performances by Liev Schreiber, Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington.",

I hate when you watch a movie and half way through the movie your like oh i know how this movie will end and in the end bam it ended that way. \r\n\r\nI thought much of the camera work was great, lots of the settings backgrounds is great. Many parts of the film are great. \r\n\r\nbut now i go to why i wouldn't suggest this to my friends, and this isn't really a film making reason, its more of a directors intent reason. \r\n\r\nIts pretty easy to see what the director is trying to show us about the government in this movie, the government as a whole is pretty much run by a corporation, the biggest political benefactor. \r\n\r\nNow understand that in the setting of this movie the so called machurian's candiate isn't in the white house. So its the Shaw's job to get the Manchurian Candidate in the white house. But even without the control the corporation is still very much in control in government epically the military where they brainwash soldiers. \r\n\r\nIf you couldn't tell what the intent is just watch the special features kinda clear. \r\n\r\nThe writer says that they can't use the communist trying to control the world so we have to use something else, then the director mentions about the corporate take over theory, multi national corporations trying to profit from war. \r\n\r\nso i think the directors intent is to show us that corporations trying to take over the world, well atleast profit from war that our gorvernment participates in. And we should do our best to bring them down. \r\n\r\nif our bothered by stuff like this and just think its crazy you probably won't like this movie. If you can ignore it and just forget about it then you will enjoy it. But the directors intent is to important to the movie and i hatted his intent thats why i give it a low rating but the movie is done pretty well, why its a 50",

This film plays on your emotion' s and your thoughts  sort of like  someone sticking a  wire into your ear and poking your brain over and over again. It's like a monkey you've got on your back that you just can't shake.  It's  diabolical as  it is malicious  and it moves along like a evil little spider  across the screen.  Trying to draw you in and take you to a realm  of chaos, paranoia, madness and depravity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDenzel Washington turns in a fine performance as Major Ben Marco and Liev Schreiber does  just as well If not better as Raymond Prentiss Shaw, Meryl Streep is a little lacking in the  conviction  and emotion  department  and her performance was sort of annoying as the overly patriotic  and narcissistic mother of Ray Shaw. Jon Voight does  relatively well in the few scenes  he's in, but it's nothing oscar worthy or  amazing, but he is good none the less.  All in all the cast holds up very well  and  makes this a very watchable and exceedingly good movie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The Manchurian Candidate is  something of a revelation in  movies, It's like your conscious warning you that not everything in life is what it seems.   And that people, people you trust with your life or people you know can be manipulated into  mind puppets  and use for a corrupt and evil system.  The moral undertones of this movie were astounding  and eye opening, It brings to light whether or not who can be trusted? Or for that matter if where you are right now is even safe? It's a very good  political thriller that moves along at a relatively good pace , it's story flows off the screen and  embeds itself into your mind  like a  micro processor  that keeps feeding you  your worst nightmares over and over and over again until it drives you mad. The Manchurian Candidate is that film, and though it is not the original  it does live up to it's reputation well. And on some levels even surpasses it. All in all The Manchurian Candidate is one  wild and  thought provoking ride you don't want to miss.",

It's a compelling tale of post traumatic stress syndrome mixed with Government conspiracy, to the point at which you don't know what's real and what isn't and that's what makes it so tense. Very good acting as well, particularly from the likes of Denzel Washington and Liev Schrieber who, from this performance, remain as two of my favourite actors. Meryl Steep also had a good performance as the slightly scary, power hungry mother who pushes her son and goes to great lengths to get him where she wants him to be. I definitely recommend this film even if you're not into political thrillers. It's worth a watch if you want to be entertained but also if you're into psychology it's quite interesting in that field.",

This film plays on your emotion' s and your thoughts  sort of like  someone sticking a  wire into your ear and poking your brain over and over again. It's like a monkey you've got on your back that you just can't shake.  It's  diabolical as  it is malicious  and it moves along like a evil little spider  across the screen.  Trying to draw you in and take you to a realm  of chaos, paranoia, madness and depravity.\n\n\n\nDenzel Washington turns in a fine performance as Major Ben Marco and Liev Schreiber does  just as well If not better as Raymond Prentiss Shaw, Meryl Streep is a little lacking in the  conviction  and emotion  department  and her performance was sort of annoying as the overly patriotic  and narcissistic mother of Ray Shaw. Jon Voight does  relatively well in the few scenes  he's in, but it's nothing oscar worthy or  amazing, but he is good none the less.  All in all the cast holds up very well  and  makes this a very watchable and exceedingly good movie.\n\n\n\n The Manchurian Candidate is  something of a revelation in  movies, It's like your conscious warning you that not everything in life is what it seems.   And that people, people you trust with your life or people you know can be manipulated into  mind puppets  and use for a corrupt and evil system.  The moral undertones of this movie were astounding  and eye opening, It brings to light whether or not who can be trusted? Or for that matter if where you are right now is even safe? It's a very good  political thriller that moves along at a relatively good pace , it's story flows off the screen and  embeds itself into your mind  like a  micro processor  that keeps feeding you  your worst nightmares over and over and over again until it drives you mad. The Manchurian Candidate is that film, and though it is not the original  it does live up to it's reputation well. And on some levels even surpasses it. All in all The Manchurian Candidate is one  wild and  thought provoking ride you don't want to miss.",

His innate humanism, his interest in whomever he films, comes through every time Denzel Washington's anxious face fills the frame in The Manchurian Candidate. This film only works if the viewer feels Marco's anxiety, paranoia, and frustration. Washington communicates these things with the smallest of facial tics and the subtlest shifts in his eyes. Demme's camera captures every moment of a nuanced, controlled performance that keeps the audience with the film, even when it goes into situations where it becomes harder and harder to suspend disbelief. Liev Schreiber matches Washington's minimalist intensity, and he also benefits from Demme's sympathetic, observant camera. Fine turns from Meryl Streep, Kimberly Elise, and the woefully underappreciated Jeffrey Wright all offer up engaging performances that gain from Demme's fearless love of faces. Those familiar with the original film version of Richard Condon's book may be surprised by some of the changes in this version. Demme and his screenwriters have more or less eliminated the black humor of the original, and they have altered some of the film's major plotlines. These changes all work within this film and help allow it to stand up against any comparison with the original. Anybody familiar with Demme's politics will know what he has to say on the subject of the war on terror, but anybody familiar with Demme's films should also be confident that the politics never once compromise or overwhelm the story. The Manchurian Candidate is a well-made, intelligent summer popcorn film anchored by the compelling face of Denzel Washington.",

Scheiber is very versatile and subtlely villianous in this film like he was in Wolverine but minus the savagry of Victor Creed.  Meryl Streep, a Hilary Clinton clone, scorches the sreen again and of course Denzel brings the Paranioa that should have been the result for Deja Vu but what was lacking in that film is made up in this a thousand fold.  Very entertaining, a little predictable at times, but worth the watching.",
