    "summary": "College student Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) is afflicted with headaches so painful that he frequently blacks out. While unconscious, Evan is able to travel back in time to difficult moments in his childhood. He can also alter the past for friends, like Kayleigh (Amy Smart), who was molested by her father (Eric Stoltz). But changing the past can drastically alter the present, and Evan finds himself in nightmarish alternate realities, including one where he's locked away in prison.",

This one has a more intriguing premise, even if it is a little overly ambitious and never quite reaches its potential. It's still watchable and entertaining though it can be a bit melodramatic, exploitive and misogynistic at times. Kutcher isn't a great leading actor but I thought he did pretty well here,  believably portraying a character caught in an increasingly weird and paradoxical world that never quite matches up to his hopes. Not a bad film at all though it never reaches greatness it's solid and has rewatch value. A dependable early 2000's stalwart with some really good thriller/sci-fi elements that are fun to watch. You could do worse than this movie, much worse. \nMY RATING SCALE :  7 out of 10 points.",

Até hoje ainda não vi um filme com conteúdo parecido. O filme é incrível. Desde que assiti ele, já devo ter visto mais 10 X. Um filme inteligente, com um conteúdo muito rico e reflexivo, sobre a vida, educação, amizades, traumas, a importância da saúde familiar e de como decisões podem alterar a nossa vida. Uma interpretação dos atores muito boa, que para mim merecia um #oscar Aston descobre que tem o poder de voltar ao tempo e toda vez que ele tenta consertar algo que ocorreu, as coisas complicam e nunca saem perfeitas como ele deseja. E o filme relata de como traumas podem afetar na vida de uma pessoa ou pessoas. E como descisões certas dão outro rumo a nossa vida. Um filme frentico que você entra no mundo dele. Parabéns aos idealizadores. Tiveram mais outros 2 filmes, mas não tiveram a mesma magia, mesma arte.\nRoteiro: Maravilhoso\nVale apena assistir? Com certeza, mesmo sendo um filme de 2004.\nNota: 9,5",

Things don't turn out well, as the time traveler learns that any actions he takes to rectify past mistakes only winds up destroying the future for both him, and everyone else he loves. Gradually, he realizes the awful truth about himself. The truth that many of the best of us suspect about ourselves from time to time, and so many more of us desperately need to understand: life would be better for everyone if we could go back to where our mothers were going in to labor, and strangle ourselves in her womb. The Butterfly Effect is a thrilling, inventive, and yes, even dark and disturbing romantic science fiction film that managed to do the almost impossible for me: it made me care about the fate of Ashton Kutcher. If I said I loved this movie, that would be an understatement as close to a lie as an understatement can be. The Butterfly Effect is hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. If for whatever reason you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely see it. NOW.",

Maybe a bit rushed towards the end but a sad conclusion with Kutcher and Amy Smart (his long term love interest) passing in the street as strangers having corrected his Butterfly Effect issues.",

Unfortunately, since the story is constantly jumping between time periods, it becomes tiresome and frequently difficult to follow. The idea behind the Butterfly Effect is that small changes can have major consequences, but many of the changes made to the past are major in themselves. I certainly wouldn't count first degree murder to be anything less than major. The acting from the supporting cast is hit and miss, and the version I watched, the Director's Cut, has a much different ending to the theatrical version. The DC version is a bit of a downer, but it complements the dark tone the film establishes and maintains throughout its runtime. Not a film I'd watch again, but it does have an interesting premise and a few memorable moments that made it worth the single viewing.",

I watched this movie for the first time when i was about 7 or 8 and it scared the crap out of me but left an impact because my young mind was to confused to understand anything that was going on. I've revisited this movie many times since then now that I am older, and always makes wonder about life and whose life I am directly and indirectly affecting, would everyone be better off without me? Such a profound thought. This movie is one of my favorite movies and everyone who has watched it that grew up in my generation and is my age now(20) loves it. I think we all are just familiar with Ashton, and now know he can play more serious roles which wasn't the case of initial critics thoughts in 2004 because they still thought of him as the funny kid from the seventies show and went in the theater with a negative outlook. Great Plot, Great acting the girl played by Amy smart gives an amazing performance as well.",

The Butterfly Effect is noted by audiences as showing that Ashton Kutcher can act despite his poor reputation on anything that isn't That '70s Show or Dude, Where's My Car? Butterfly Effect is convoluted but it knows it's convoluted. We're just as confused about these alternate realities as Event Reborn is. Yes, that's what his name actually is. Evan Treborn = Event Reborn. What would I do without you, TV Tropes? Besides having a life? The premise provides a unique take on time-travel. It has some implausibility sure but wouldn't you be alarmed if a 7-year-old who's been acting innocent suddenly began cursing and playing the precocious kid despite lack of establishment that he was precocious? It all results in a bittersweet ending that teaches us about letting go of the things we want the most. The Butterfly Effect is not as bad as the critics let on. Especially since the direct-to-DVD sequels are not only in-name-only but also half-assed rehashes of the first film from what I heard with only one or two things shoehorned in to remove doubts that it's a sequel.",

            "content": "The Butterfly Effect stars Ashton Kutcher as a man, Evan, who has had a very troubled past and some of the memories he can't even remember because he blacks out and then forgets what happened while he was blacked out. He writes everything he does in journals and he's found out that reading the journal entries can take him back to the moment of his blackout and he can change what he did to alter the future. The concept of this movie is really great! I find it to be a very intriguing and exciting idea, but the execution wasn't the best. Where this movie suffers the most is its beginning and ending. The first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie are very jarring. We see him experience every single blackout he had and it gets very annoying after the 2nd one. All the characters, when they're kids, are also annoying. Some of the scenes concerning Tommy were just hilarious because he was such a sadistic bastard that it's hard to imagine any kid doing what he did. The acting also isn't the best. The kid actors are very unbelievable in their roles. Thankfuly, the movie does improve once Evan gets older and starts to figure things out. That's when the \"time travel\" plot kicks in and things get going. I really enjoyed the middle part of the movie. Seeing various realities and versions of these characters was very fun and interesting. It made me think of the decisions I made and how different things could've been if I'd have done something else. I was always impressed with the thought of changing your future; how even the smallest choice can affect your life. When the movie deals with those problems, it's fantastic! Also have to give my praise to Amy Smart who plays a lot of different versions of her character; she was great in the movie. What I also found interesting is that in every reality there was something Evan wanted to change to make life better for his friends, but when he finds a reality that has all his friends in good state and he's the one who's messed up, he still wants to change it. I also found that to be very relatable. I often found myself thinking what I could've done, or not done, to help someone, but then I got rid of that thought because of what could've happened to me. Kind of hard to explain, but I'm sure you get the point. Ashton Kutcher is okay in this role. I would've prefered a more serious actor in the role, but he didn't ruin the movie or anything like it, I'm just so used to seeing him in comedic roles that this was a really weird turn. He does a solid job. Now, the ending(s). I watched the Director's Cut first and I predicted the ending quite early, so I was quite disappointed when the ending hit. It just wasn't very impactful for me. I watched the other three endings after finishing the movie and, in my opinion, the best ending is the \"Open ending\". It's a lot different from the DC one, but I found it a lot more satisfying. I know the DC ending makes a bit more sense considering the things said in the movie, but you can just see it coming from the beginning. All in all, The Butterfly Effect is a good movie which suffers from some very nonsensical plot points, mediocre child actors, but is very interesting to watch nevertheless. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I recommend watching the Theatrical Cut of this movie if you plan on watching the movie.",

And the alternate, directors cut ending were SPOILER kutcher travels back into his mums womb and strangles himself with the umbilical cord, is just moronic, END SPOILER. If that sounds like a bad review, it's definitely not, in fact this is a fascinating film, and one of the most unique, original time travel stories of recent times. It's also haunting, really grim and often outright disturbing (pedophilia, dog burning, brutal prison shankings) Plus it has the rare sight of ashton kutcher toning down his utter douchery and giving a decent performance for once, he's actually quite affecting in this. This is a strong, diffrent film, dark and often enthralling if you can get past some of the more stupid stuff, like kutcher crushing a granola bar with his rubber gimp hand.",

One should not have hard feelings and fear if you managed to comprehend the everlasting truth.

            "content": "\"The Butterfly Effect\" is a paradox in itself because it's a science fiction film that will in no way satisfy fans of science fiction and will instead appeal to casual movie viewers. If you can manage to be engaged by the plot and not think about what you're watching too much you might miss the glaring problems and inconsistencies in the story but even then, that's a challenge. Ashton Kutcher plays Evan Treborn. As a young child, Evan experiences frequent blackouts. These memory lapses appear to be triggered by intense periods of trauma or stress and when even hypnosis fails to unearth what happened during a particularly intense event, Evan is encouraged by his therapist to keep a daily journal. As an adult, Evan discovers that when he reads his journals he can temporarily transfer his adult consciousness into his past self and is even able to alter the events that occur. These trips back in time correspond with the blackouts and Evan sees a great opportunity to prevent or fix some of the traumatic events that plagued his childhood sweetheart, her brother and some of his friends. As he takes multiple trips back in time, he realizes that even the smallest change in the past can alter reality in unpredictable ways.\n\nThis is a pretty interesting premise. Who hasn't wanted to travel back in time and prevent or enable certain events in their past? Combine this desire with the fact that Evan's childhood is filled with events that are genuinely disturbing and damaging to the people around him and you've got the opportunity to have some real drama and thrills. You sympathize with the character because when you see the potential here, you also want these events to be erased from history. There are also some clever twists in the story, with some changes benefiting Evan, others putting him in a position that's far worse than the one he started in. In some cases, journal entries are destroyed or never even exist so there's a genuine thriller element to the film as well. Evan always has good intentions but because of the unpredictable nature of the timeline, you can never predict what is going to happen in the long run.\n\nThere is a giant flaw with the film however; the fact that under closer inspection it just doesn't really make any sense. It feels like the overall outline of the film was written down first and then the scenes of time travel were inserted in so that they would reach a specific end instead of reaching a logical one. Every time Evan travels back in time, the rules seem to change. Sometimes, when he travels back in time it plays out exactly as it did in the original reality; ok that's all right because maybe the changes he made (if any) were inconsequential. If a trip back in time can in fact have no impact on the future one might wonder why the film is titled \"The Butterfly Effect\" but logically, that makes sense so moving on. Sometimes, the changes to reality are very small, such as a scar appearing on Evan's body. In these instances, there are great inconsistencies. At a point in the film, Evan has to convince a friend that he is able to travel back in time. To do this, he travels back, mutilates himself and when he returns to his future body, the scars appear. If you are a fan of time-travel stories, that sequence will immediately jump at you as making no sense. If Evan travelled back in time and altered his body this way, then he always had those scars. Theoretically though, this method of alternating reality could work so once you wrap your head around it, you'll be ok with it. After all, this story is all about a character's consciousness that stays the same even as the people and events around him change. HOWEVER this logic is contradicted in the next trip back in time. After proving to his friend that he can travel to the past, Evan alters his life and awakens in a reality and body that is completely different from the one in the previous scene. Why did one trip back change nothing up until the point where he was talking to his friend while another changed everything except for Evan's memories? There are many time travel stories where the past is altered and you have to mentally pause the film and think to yourself that time travel basically defies logic in itself but at least in a tight story the laws of time travel are consistent, meaning you can just accept what happens and move on. In here, that just isn't the case.\n\nAnother problem with the film is the main character Evan. It is established early in the film that he's an intelligent, if not brilliant young man at the top of his class. In fact he's so smart that his peers resent him. Why is it then that the man is constantly baffled when he alters the past? Every time he arrives in a new reality, he is always confused and acts like he doesn't understand what happened.  Some of this could be attributed to the fact that essentially Evan has travelled to a different dimension where an event in the past altered reality but there's an element in the film that contradicts this. You see, whenever Evan wakes up in this new life, he sees flashes of the events that lead up to it. There is also a scene where they flat-out explain that when he wakes up his brain suddenly amasses a massive amount of memories, indicating that he now knows everything he should know about this world in addition to his previous encounters. Why is he so surprised when people act differently then? Why can't he blend in? If he's so smart, why is he always in such a hurry to get back to his journals and alter the past? Doesn't he realize that when it comes to time travel he literally has all the time in the world to go back and fix everything that went wrong? \n\nThe plot holes and leaps in logic are quite numerous in \"The Butterfly Effect\" and that's the reason why the movie won't really appeal to fans of science fiction. If you're watching it with friends (as I did) you'll find yourself constantly pausing the movie to discuss what just happened and ask the other people watching if a) what happened works with the loosely established internal logic of the story b) said logic makes any sense or c) if any intelligent human being would act as Evan or the other people in the film would. The good ideas and genuine drama of the film get swept up in the inconsistencies and the momentum that the story is building towards completely falls apart because you'll constantly get pulled out of the story by the lack of logic. If you're not a fan of science fiction (or I guess if you're incredibly forgiving) you probably won't give a second thought to the movie and you'll just accept that what's going on makes sense. If you're that kind of viewer then by all means watch \"The Butterfly Effect\" and you'll be totally immersed in the interesting plot. You'll genuinely have a good time and you'll enjoy watching the hero try and fix the world while experiencing all of these different alternate versions of the characters present in the story.\n\nThe film is available in a theatrical version and a Directors cut, both of which share the same problems. The major difference is in the ending and neither hit quite the right note. The theatrical cut works logically but doesn't feel like it belongs with the overall grim tone of the film. The Director's cut fits more with the mood of the story but the actions taken by Evan here are extremely illogical. There's a good movie somewhere in the script for \"The Butterfly Effect\" but this should have been run through a fine-toothed comb before shooting began. Maybe then the problems would have been less numerous and the film bearable for fans of time travel but as is, it's a mess. Despite an intriguing story, good performances and some good drama there's just too much wrong for \"The Butterfly Effect\" to earn a real recommendation.

Ashton Kutcher gives a good performance and I am a Kutcher supporter, and Logan lerman gave an excellent performance as the young Ashton.

But for one reason or another, this just didnâ(TM)t happen, leaving me to watch this on TV a couple of years later.\n\nI was left disappointed. This was mainly because the film was very gritty, at times dower and not what I or many would have expected from a film in this genre. But with repeat viewings and finally watching this version, the Directorâ(TM)s Cut, with a more downbeat and tragic conclusion, I realised that I was wrong.\n\nYes, this film does not tick the correct boxes for a film of this time, but that is because it is not playing it safe. It is doing what any great groundbreaking films should do and that is to find the truth of the story and tell it, show it and help the audience engage and feel it, in an uncompromising way.\n\n*** SPOILERS ***\n\nThe film deals with troubled childhoods of four kids, two of whom grow up to become Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart. (Not literally, of course!) Kutcherâ(TM)s lead, has the ability to travel back to his own past for brief moments by reading his childhood journals or in some cases, watching home movies or looking at photos.\n\nHis intention upon discovering this gift, is to repair some of the damage that these events have cause to the group, who have sustained several traumas and left them in various states of disfunctionality as adults. But, as the metaphor relating to Chaos Theory states, âDoes the flap of a butterflyâ(TM)s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?â Philip Merilees:\n\nWe witness several distinct changes in then present as a result of his tampering and this often results in more pain, in one way or another.\n\nThis is a gripping film, with a true sense of itself, philosophy and needs of the narrative to justify its own dower conclusions, and ultimately, Kutcherâ(TM)s final decisions.\n\nThe sound design, cinematography general direction are outstanding here, with power use of all the key elements to give us a naturalistic feel, not dis-similar from something that Steven Spielberg might produce.\n\nThe Theatrical Cut was good, but this version is superior, with a new and more appropriate ending more in keeping the with the general tone of the film, this should be a true Sci-Fi classic, in the same league as the likes of âPlanet Of The Apesâ, âThe Day The Earth Caught Fireâ and in to a lesser extent, this being a more widely accepted addition, âDonnie Darkoâ.\n\nHighly recommended.",

The character and his concerning blackouts are fairly dramatic, and the overall tone of the movie surprisingly heavy. I liked how it is darkly ironic and makes you realize the weight of even small decisions and events in the overall outcome of your life. The story is insightful and reminds us that no one has a perfect life; there will always be tragedies, trials and imperfections. Ashton Kutcher does an adequate job but comedy is a genre he much better suited for. He does not sink the ship but there could have been better choices for the lead role. The kids in the movie do a better job and carry the load of most of the hard hitting scenes. I feel like more could have been done with the last part of them movie, many of the alternate realities are too extreme and none of them are crafted as well as they could be. The big concept was strong but the plot was just a little heavy handed and clumsy. It is a shame I felt like this average movie could have been more.",

After heading off to college, he begins to have the blackouts again. Evan soon realizes he has the ability to alter reality through time-travel. \n\nDirectors / writers Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber created quite a thought-provoking and suspenseful movie here. It makes you think about your actions in life and the sort of repercussions they have on those around us. It's a disturbing reminder that the things we say and do really affect people. \n\nThis was Ashton Kutcher's first real dramatic leading role and he handled it well. It can be hard to push the image of an actor's character out of your mind if it gets stuck in there. I think Kutcher's biggest obstacle was getting audiences to see him as anyone but Michael Kelso from \"That 70s Show\" at the time. He succeeded in my opinion. \n\nhttp://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

            "content": "Definately not a feel good film, but rather dark and tragic in every sense of the word. The film itself is an emotionally provacative piece of work that had me feeling sad and depressed. Nonetheless I think that this makes it a very powerful film to evoke such strong feelings while watching it. It is, for lack of a better term, very human. On a different note there were also many complexities to do with chaos theory underlying the raw emotional turmoil that the characters endure such as time travel, alternate universes and such, but rather than rely on these interesting ideas and theories to carry the movie, it is instead simply used as a background setting for an incredible story. I loved it for what it is, but not something you see to be entertained. Ashton Krutcher and Amy Smart do a remarkable job portraying the same characters in different settings. It reminded me of BACK TO THE FUTURE but in a extremly dark way.",
