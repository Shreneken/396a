    "summary": "Mathilde (Audrey Tautou) is told that her fianc\u00e9 (Gaspard Ulliel) has been killed in World War I. She refuses to believe this, however, and begins trying to find out what actually happened on the battlefield the night he was supposedly killed, enlisting the help of a private investigator. During her search, she stumbles across evidence of the inhumane and morally bankrupt system used by the French to deal with deserters, and hears from other men who were sentenced to extreme punishment.",

Visually stunning and inventive throughout, A Very Long Engagement is deeply touching as a romance and graphically harrowing as a war film.  However, it is so filled with both narrative and visual detail that it can become exhausting, much like trying to take in all of the scenery while on a high-speed train \u2013 you know where you've been and where you're going, but you can't help but get the feeling that you've missed a lot of things along the way.",

            "content": "I didn't expect to like this film, but that was because I was making a lot of assumptions when I read the brief description and caught snippets of \"French period war film\" and thought I'd be chained to a by-the-numbers romantic melodrama filled with bittersweet longing, yada yada. Color me surprised when A Very Long Engagement turned out to be something entirely different - think Paths of Glory, but French and thoroughly mixed with both a simple, touching romance and an actual investigational mystery. Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life shockingly brutal and realistic depictions of World War I trench warfare that still look great decades later, but pulls off a truly amazing trick by interweaving them with a peacetime detective story that oozes with the same levels of infectious warmth and adventure that Am\u00e9lie received such acclaim for. Told with an ensemble cast featuring a who's who of French acting talent of the time, what could have easily been a confusing mess of names connected by strings on a corkboard ends up becoming a tapestry of stories that each feel real and empathetic without needing excessive runtime dedicated to them independently. A total surprise and a wholehearted endorsement for anyone looking for something original with a taste for both the saddening and the fantastical. (4/5)",

However, it does highlight the horrors of World War 1. It literally takes you in the trenches. The cinematography is magnificent. Even though, I couldn't quite keep up with the plot, I was routing for the heroine and hoping that she was right. I admired her dedication to finding her fiancee. Even after 2 and a half hours, I wouldn't mind a sequel. I think the rebuilding of their relationship would prove more interesting than her hunt to find him.",

Maybe it's the sheer number and variety of plot twists, but I kept thinking that scene after scene would be the final one, only to realise there was more to come. It's a mish-mash of styles, with striking war sequences set against whimsy in ways that don't always work.\n\nNot without flaws, as Mark Kermode might say, but worth your time.",
