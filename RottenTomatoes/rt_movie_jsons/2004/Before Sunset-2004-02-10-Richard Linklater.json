    "summary": "A sequel to \"Before Sunrise,\" this film starts nine years later as Jesse (Ethan Hawke) travels across Europe giving readings from a book he wrote about the night he spent in Vienna with Celine (Julie Delpy). After his reading in Paris, Celine finds him, and they spend part of the day together before Jesse has to again leave for a flight. They are both in relationships now, and Jesse has a son, but as their strong feelings for each other start to return, both confess a longing for more.",

            "content": "A story of \"what could've been?\" It's been nine years in both Jesse's (Ethan Hawke) and Celine's (Julie Delpy) last encounter in Before Sunrise and the release of the film. Both characters, now in their early 30s, are at completely different times in their life from their meet-cute on the train headed into Vienna. Jesse is at the famous English-language bookstore in Paris, Shakespeare and Company, giving an interview and signing for his debut novel \u2014 how much is fact or fiction becomes a constant during the pair's short walkabout in the City of Light. Nine years earlier, Jesse and Celine promised to meet six months later in Vienna at the train station without trading phone numbers, addresses, or any other forms of identification. She didn't appear because of her grandmother's death; he claims he didn't either, but soon breaks that he did and her absence crushed him. The plot is much the same as the first film. However, even with the Parisian backdrop, some of that magic is missing. It's a paltry 80-mins, shorter than both Sunrise and the third installment, Before Midnight, and it shows. If it wasn't for the car ride scene and the ending, this would've been more of a chore. Neither character is completely satisfied with their situations in life, but both are with someone else \u2014 Jesse has a wife and son while Celine lives with a boyfriend. The discussions about their tryst and Jesse's horniness for the Frenchwoman don't come off as charming like they did in 1994. This is a tough one, because if you didn't know a third installment was imminent, I would've found the ending disappointing. There was no guarantee of Sunset, and given the length of time between Sunset and Midnight (another 9 years), I don't think a viewer in 2004 knew that Sunset was a placeholder, which is exactly how it plays. That being said, I watched this in 2023 and therefore the cute ending makes me want to start Midnight forthwith and see what comes of this serendipitous couple. *10/10 for \"Che,\" the cat.",

Its basically one long conversation with lots of small talk but yet the dialogue is quite good, some of it poignant and possibly relatable - I found it an insightful and cheery watch overall. It was nice to see the characters again and it was somehow re-assuring that the two main characters were able to re-start their conversation, as if they hadn't spent many years apart. It has a natural feel, it doesn't seem forced or bland or boring and indeed I reckon Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have a good on screen chemistry. This is the sort of film that could become a bit tedious and slow paced, in terms of the basic plot but I enjoyed it, with the random subjects covered (hypothetical situations discussed and so on) and the decent performances.\n\nFor once, I enjoyed that this isn't a fast paced film, as it were. Its an enjoyable watch and I'd happily recommend it.",

This movie now (the second) captures two people who are now ready to make their love happen. In that, it is more beautiful. It also feels very genuinely because they are indeed ten years older, as the movie was shot ten (or around that) years after the first movie. It feels more dynamic and less stale. Different scenes, more characters.",

Expectations have risen and the pair have independently become jaded as the instant connection that the two felt has caused the long-term compromises that each have made to feel as if they have sacrificed one of their most tangible attempts at happiness. The dialogue reflects their evolving relationship - somewhat reluctant to probe the possibilities of a reignited affair, but intermittently flirtatious, often hopeful, intermittently despondent, and surprsingly revealing given how little time they have actually spent in each other's company (their relationship having been predominantly built off of expectation and imagination rather than actual contact). The rar sequel, particularly in the romance genre, that doesn't exploit its predecessor, but actively builds off of it. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "Richard Linklater's \"Before Sunset\" is a warm, funny and poignant romantic masterpiece that explores modern-day relationships with profound insight. With his tenth feature, writer/director Richard Linklater crafted an unforgettable romantic drama that holds up today as a classic of the genre. Using gorgeous cinematography, Linklater draws viewers into the lives of a passionate couple reuniting in Paris. From intimate close-ups to stunning establishing shots, the cinematography keeps viewers immersed in the film's beautiful setting. As usual, Linklater's screenplays elevate his movies to another level. His greatest strength as a screenwriter is his ability to use realistic dialogue to keep viewers absorbed in a romantic relationship. In terms of acting, the two leads are at the top of their game. Ethan Hawke delivers one of the best performances of his career as Jesse. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the affection, maturity and self-reflections of a man that has changed over time. Julie Delpy continues to excel in the role of C\u00e9line. Not only is she incredibly attractive, but her expressions convey more emotions than one would expect. Although \"Before Sunset\" is undeniably unforgettable, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it suffers from an abrupt ending. The film concludes on a slightly anti-climactic note that leaves viewers with questions. Nevertheless, fans of Richard Linklater will definitely enjoy \"Before Sunset\" and so will movie-goers seeking romantic entertainment. At a time when romantic dramas are rarely ever realistic in Hollywood, it's a stirring reminder of the power of dialogue-driven love stories.",

            "content": "To me this is one of the greatest movie sequels of all time and is it matches and in some ways surpasses it's predecessor as we see a love develop over time. The perfection of Before Sunrise (1995) is beautiful as we watch two young people fall in love after impulsively getting of the train for a day in Vienna but here we see two older, jaded people who still may have a chance at romance. Linklater brings his directing skill to the film, the pacing is again fantastic, while the screenplay, a collaboration between Linklater, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, reflects the stresses and responsibilities of people who are nine years older than the young lovers from the first film and yet it is still achingly romantic. Most people don't age as well as Hawke and Delpy but their faces are more lined than they were in the first film and oddly they have both become extremely gaunt but still it reflects change and much like Boyhood he is able to show how time never stops moving but some things remain the same.\n\nThe film is set nine years later in Paris where Celine, Julie Delpy, lives and Jesse, Ethan Hawke, is promoting a book, This Time, which is largely based on his experiences with Celine as seen in Before Sunrise. Celine did not go to the decided on meeting place six months after their departure in Vienna but Jesse did and when they meet up again old wounds are revisited. Similar to the structure of the first film the two wander around Paris for a day and discuss love and how their lives have changed in the past nine years. Jesse is now married with a child but the connection between them remains strong and the final shot implies that they will stay together.\n\nThe thing I was most worried about going into the film was the fact that we were being asked to root for a married man with a child to have an affair however the film is able to write Jesse as a sympathetic character and I wanted them to be together so badly throughout the film. The treatment of his marriage is sensitive as we understand that he never quite gave up on Celine and feels as though he's \"Running a nursery with the person I used to love.\" Hawke's own marriage broke down close to the time of this film's production and he married his children's nanny shortly afterwards so his own personal experiences may have affected the writing of the character and it shows because his problems sound genuine. The two are as adorable together as ever and yet they do have a complex and difficult relationship while their reasons for not being together feel realistic.\n\nCeline has now become the \u00e2~hardened cynic' that Jesse was in the first film and Delpy's perennially furrowed brow convinces us that she has a lot of reservations in beginning a relationship with a married man. The dialogue she delivers also feels realistic as she rightly responds with outrage when Jesse suggests that they try to start their relationship back up from where they left it when so much has changed. Her admission of vividly remembering the sexual experiences that were implied in the first film is also touching as it is clear that she still desperately loves Jesse and fondly remembers that night and her pain in being separated from him is hard to express. Some of Delpy's wooden line delivery grated on me but nobody else could embody the role the way she does.\n\nThe final scene in the film brought me to tears as Jesse enters Celine's apartment and she plays a song for him that is a thinly veiled serenade then dances to Nina Simone and tells him \"Baby, you are going to miss that train\" and he responds \"I know\" with tears in his eyes. This tells us that they are going to stay together against all odds and it was a euphoric moment knowing that they were finally going to stay together. The song she plays feels very personal and it was a lovely moment when she drops his name into it and we get a reaction shot from Hawke. The whole scene was romantic and perfect and I never wanted it to end.\n\nThis is a worthy follow up to Before Sunrise and is realistic, intelligent and emotionally moving. I loved it despite my initial reservations and I fell even more in love with Jesse and Celine.",

All of that exists in Before Sunset as well, so I was relatively bored again, and I did roll my eyes a number of times at the artificial lines. Yet this was by far the best of the trilogy. Perhaps a tiny bit of this opinion is based in the fact that it is the shortest movie of the three, so it doesn\u2019t wear out its welcome as much. However, more importantly, Before Sunset has something going on beyond what they are saying. In the other films I felt no subtlety or underlying emotion, they wore everything on their sleeves. Here they have thoughts that they want to express but they are afraid. There\u2019s something unspoken that is driving them. There are even a few blessed moments of silence when we are allowed to sense the connection without them babbling about it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I still don\u2019t care for Before Sunset much more than the other films, but at least I can see there is something here that a better script and more interesting story could have developed into a good movie.

Delpy and Hawke come back to their roles as slightly more developed actors, and are capable of working through the even-longer dialogue scenes (one of them must have been a good seven minute single-shot!) while still maintaining our attention as the tension between them builds.\n\nOne of the best moments in the entire movie is captured in the accompanying screenshot: the small moment of impossible tenderness between these two characters-in-crisis could easily be missed, but is so perfectly human that it's an indelible moment in my memory. How could Linklater have written the blocking between these characters that well?\n\nThis movie, as much as Before Sunrise, is a move about and containing just two people; everyone else is background noise. That's challenging for one film, and is in no way reduced for a second.

Linklater had hinted at this in the first of the series, Before Sunrise, but in Before Sunset, every minute is even more precious because it is perhaps all the time Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have to spend with each other. Before Sunrise was not missing much, but imagine if you had only watched the movie when it came out, then, nine years later without warning, a sequel comes out. It would be easy to idealize the happenings of the first movie, just so the second one seemed extra magical. And what's even more outstanding is how well, in fact much better, Before Sunset stands on its own. That's because the chemistry is not beholden to what happened nine years ago. It's still there, after all this time. It's more mature, too. They have real responsibilities now, and the consequences of their actions are much higher. With that, they find an easier time to laugh about the circumstances of the world and have more hope, though they certainly were not lacking those skills in their younger selves. Hawke and Delpy are also more self-aware here. And, perhaps most importantly, the two never once directly propose the idea of getting back together, or even sharing some physically romantic gesture. They only express such feelings through stories, dreams, songs. There's tension in what is unresolved, but is relieved by the calm in what has been resolved. This dichotomy means Before Sunset ultimately comes out as even better than Before Sunrise. I'm looking forward to the next (and perhaps final?) movie.",

Though completely optimistic and good hearted, it lost me at that overall elevation of love, finding the true love at such a random encounter on one day. However, I have to say that after watching Before Sunset, my thoughts on Before Sunrise elevated. One that may say that would most likely say it if the sequel were an inferior movie, but Before Sunset is absolutely not. Before Sunset builds off the events occurring nine years ago in Before Sunrise, but builds in a way that is so perfectly works. Before Sunset is not an unnecessary sequel, especially when it excels its predecessor, and is the best way to make a sequel to a romance movie.\n\nIn Before Sunrise, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) had a heightened view of love, life, and the future. Like I said before, it was very optimistic, most notably in its ending. Instead of travelling down the same road that Sunrise took, Before Sunset shows our two leads both having different ideals, problems, and outlooks on life than before. And rightfully so, their mindsets should have changed in the nine years of not seeing each other. While both flustered and excited by how they get to meet again, both Jesse and Celine are bitter and show the struggle they've had after that one great night in 1994. Jesse, though sounds successful when written down in a short biography, is a shell of the man who idealized love, which also goes for Celine, who achieved her dream, but faltered on romance.\n\nYou sit and watch in awe as these two walk and talk and sit and talk, and you begin to ask \"why can't these two just be together\"? And Before Sunset doesn't hold any of its punches back, it clearly explains the problems with you thinking that, all the while giving such a subtle romantic connection between the two leads. You an feel the chemistry, the sparks flying, but no grandeur romantic acts come in sight for either. It's perfect, realistic, and a more mature movie than Before Sunrise.\n\nI did not expect to love Before Sunset as much as I did, especially after only liking Before Sunrise (which I gave a 4 out of 5). The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is incredible, downplaying the romance and love for one another, but still showing their affection for one another. It's not as long as Before Sunrise, but still manages to hit all the points it needed to hit, along with an ending that perfectly wraps it all up by leaving you both satisfied and craving for more.",

Jesse (an even better Ethan Hawke) is on a tour for his book, inspired by the one night he spent with Celine (once again a great Julie Delpy), and then Jesse notices Celine at one of his signings in Paris. Now that they are reunited, they walk around Paris before Jesse has to catch a flight, once again talking about their lives, and everything that had both changed and stayed the same. \n     One thing that this movie has that Before Sunrise did not, was an extremely short run time. At only 81 minutes, this film goes by quick, but it leaves an impression for sure. Once again with brilliant acting, directing, and writing, this movie is just as good as its predecessor. In fact it may be even better. The writing is now even better with Hawke and Delpy assisting with the script and writing massive amounts of their own dialogue. The acting is now more matured and you can see that their characters have grown as people, making them even more real than the writing does. And the directing is still beautiful with gorgeous long takes with an inventive style to them. Truly a master class in film making. And with no spoilers here, I will say that the ending is so beautiful, and it reveals so much about both characters and it makes you as a viewer appreciate everything leading up to it so much more. By far a better ending than the first film making it a much more powerful and memorable ending.\n     Overall this movie is just as good if not better than the last. everything is still perfect and the ending left me with the biggest smile on my face. Absolute perfection!!!\n\n10/10",

Extremely long takes and minimal camera movement ground the film and allows the actors' conversations to feel genuine. The script is another masterclass in enthralling, diverse dialogue and is packed with deeply meaningful parables and reflections on the enigmatic, but ultimately flawed, human condition.

Hawke has written a book about their night together in the first film, and at a book signing in Paris, he meets Delpy again.  This is a very good sequel.  It has all of the virtues of the first film, but it also deepens them by dealing with characters who are older and have new situations to confront.

            "content": "Most appealing about the \"Before ...\" films is that their romance is consuming without being in your face about it.  In them, we are witnesses to the relationship between the greatest cinematic couple of the 1990s, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and C\u00e9line (Julie Delpy), but we aren't moved by their love because they can't keep their hands off each other, because physical passion is sexier than anything us average folks could muster.  We're are, instead, moved by watching them speak to each other, divulging their laments on life, love, their fears, their pleasures.  Affection hovers in their eyes, but their relation is as cerebral as it is physically magnetic.  We could listen to them converse for days, their musings wise yet sweeping when in the presence of the other.\n\t\"Before Sunset\" is an improvement from its predecessor, the wonderful \"Before Sunrise\" (1995), the characters being older and less optimistic than they once were, the content establishing itself as more involving, and with a screenplay written by the leading actors themselves and thereby strengthening the likable realism of the film.  More is at stake, a sense of yearning for fulfillment being much more urgent.  The fleeting nature of \"Before Sunrise\" is nowhere to be found, a special, temporary night being replaced by a now-or-never afternoon in which self-reflection is integral.  And we like Jesse and C\u00e9line more now, fond of how they've matured in the crossroads of being a thirty-something.\n\tBecause much has changed in the nine years since they saw each other last: Jesse is unhappily married and has a young son, and C\u00e9line has dedicated her professional life to a sizable amount of activism.  Them coming across each other by too-good-to-be-true chance perhaps isn't so strange: Jesse has become a hugely successful author in the last decade or so, his latest best-seller being a semi-autobiographical tale about his fateful night with C\u00e9line.  He's on a press tour, his last stop Paris.  C\u00e9line catches him just as he's leaving what she bills her \"favorite bookstore.\" And so begins hours of chatter, both small and big, both witty and confessional.\n\tThose familiar with \"Before Sunrise\" might recall an ending that promised that the central twosome would meet again in Vienna after six months, exchanging no contact information solely because trust seemed like enough.  But in \"Before Sunset,\" it is revealed that, while Jesse came as promised, C\u00e9line did not, due to familial tragedy.  This change of fate acts as the center of the film - what would have happened had the couple met again half-a-year later? they (and we) ask themselves (and ourselves) over and over again.  And so the movie is a second chance, and a lyrical one at that.\n\tWe are embroiled in this relationship, and, differing from most film characters, we love Jesse and C\u00e9line.  We want them to be together in a way never felt in most romantic films, as we feel like we know them, have spent time with them, unlike most where a few cute incidents and dramatic make-out sessions are enough to enforce true love.  Jesse and C\u00e9line are the rare exception because their affection seems genuine; it's like watching people watch in love, and we take for granted what an enthralling experience that can be in the movies.  \n\tMost impressive is the repartee between Hawke, Delpy, and director Richard Linklater, who work together so fluidly that completing the sentence of the other wouldn't be out of the question.  Hawke and Delpy have effervescent electricity running in-between them, and their dialogue, co-written with Linklater, suggests improvisation when the truth is totally otherwise.  What they do here is enormously difficult - how can a sequel be a cohesive continuation, and how can a film whose success is solely based on conversation act as a feature? - but it looks effortless.\n\tSo where \"Before Sunrise\" was a poignant indie exercise, \"Before Sunset\" draws on what made it great and transforms itself into a poignant indie masterpiece.  I cannot think of a modern romance film that has affected me so immensely - it's one of the best ever made, without all that Hugh and Julia bullshit that I sometimes like.  Imagine that.",

Does the romance between Jesse & Celine is a story worthy of a sequel? Is this as unique as \"Sunrise\"? \nNine years after the events of \"Before Sunrise\", Jesse has become a bestselling novelist thanks to a book based on the events of that night with Celine. On his promotional world tour, he ends up meeting Celine again in France. \nWhile I understood why \"Before Sunrise\" achieved its cult status and I praised most of the techniques used to tell that story, I found it underwhelming to my taste thus I wasn't exactly anxious to see Jesse & Celine again, but surprisingly this sequel managed to surpass my expectations (which admittedly weren't that high to begin with). \"Before Sunset\" takes all that made its predecessor as beloved as it is: The acting is even better, Linklater\u00b4s directing is more personal and even more showoffy due to some long takes, even gorgeous settings, the characters are more developed, the pacing takes advantage of every single minute of this short running time, the comedy is still somewhat funny, the interactions are as relatable as last time (or even more, or at least for me), the minimal soundtrack works when it is used, and the romance is taken to new directions but it still is believable. But the best thing of this sequel is the script. Thanks to Hawk and Delpy, the dialog is no longer the pretentious hippie Linklater\u00b4s trademark, it is natural, adequate to the age of these characters, emotional when it's appropriate, and overall more engaging.\n\"Before Sunset\" is one of those sequels that are undeniably better than the original. It has all the elements that made the first one as unique and enjoyable but mixed with a more mature script and even powerful emotional moments.",

This is starting to feel a lot like Boyhood now, considering it's the same director I wasn't that suprised, but this is much better executed. The ending leaves some things unanswered, but I hope we get a great ending in the third movie, Before Midnight. All in all, a great sequel that is really worth checking out because of how real and natural it feels, and the fact that the movie is literally as long as their time they spent together in this movie is really fascinating!

To simulate a nine year advancement in time, anyone else would slather the leads with aging makeup, crank out a ham-fisted pastiche of a screenplay, and release the sequel in a year, two tops. Linklater literally waited nine years to film Before Sunset, tweaking and perfecting the screenplay and releasing five films in the meantime. And, especially in the context of Before Sunrise, the result is epically fitting. Jesse and Celine meet up again in Paris, briefly, getting another chance to talk about love nine years after the events depicted in the first film. Sure, it doesn't offer much in terms of narrative drive, and it's all talk and not much else, but Sunset us an out-and-out joy to watch, a subtle, atmospheric slice of life, perfectly capturing the naivety, the delight, and the mystery that is part of being in love.

I had problems with most of the dialogue that was, more or less, philosophical clap-trap, and even though this film still has a little of that, there's much more worth talking about this time around. I also like the sequel more because it's the logical step in the process of these two people coming back together, and the fact that it's a lean 81 minutes makes it even better. There isn't much time for waxing poetic, and that made it better for me. It actually felt much more real and relatable, and gave me more of a reason to care about these two characters. I also like that there was some conflict introduced, of which there was none in the previous film. I'm sure this isn't a popular opinion, but it's a much better film by comparison, simply for the fact these two characters feel like real people now, as opposed to aimless 20-somethings.",

It is set in the beautiful Paris and the chemistry is great btw the two.

A few times I did question the lead male on his character but overall the film did a good job of making u feel empathy for him. Then when u finally think there will be a resolution at the end of the film, it just ends abruptly. I really hate when movies do that bc I feel like its a cop out n in this films case felt like a lot of foreplay with no sex at the end.

This definitely did not feel like a forced sequel, it fit and made sense. I love the fact that the experiences Jesse and Celine shared in the first film have clearly effected them here. The movie opens at a book signing where Jesse is in Paris discussing his just finished novel about his time a decade ago with Celine. This was a perfect move by Richard Linklater. A difference from the first film is that this one takes place in real time. The movie's duration is one hour and twenty minutes and shows these characters together almost in a never-ending scene for the entire time. This was an extremely interesting and different from any other film I've ever seen. Where this film falls is how it does not feel like a complete movie or one that can stand on its own. Without seeing the first film, this one would not be very enjoyable and ends on such a frustrating cliffhanger it just does not feel complete without the next installment. In my opinion, every movie in a franchise should be its own and feel complete while helping the franchise as a whole. This film seems like it was put there just to help the franchise, not to be its own movie. This is still a great film with a wonderful script, astounding direction and two excellently developed and loved characters, I just simply wish it could stand better on its own.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nFor nine years, people were left with questions on the fate of Celina and Jesse's relationship; Linklater comes back to give us the answers with Before Sunset. The first film could have simply ended there and its effect on audiences later on would, at least in my opinion, would become far more effective, leaving viewers constantly in a state of thought and imagination; so the presence of Before Sunset did dampen the profound effect of the first film, but on its own, it brings enough progression of their now complicated relationship, maintaining the same engagement that was found before, constantly wondering how it would all turn out; though the release of Before Midnight makes the outcome of this film fairly obvious.\n\nLinklater comes back as screenwriter, along with both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy as co-screenwriters. It is still features that iconic rambling conversation that drove the first film, but this time, since history and characterisation have been established for these characters before the film, the film's romance isn't much on the forefront and instead revealing itself during the latter aspects of the film. The film's first half deals more with the individual personalities of its characters, how different they are from one another, showing how much these characters have grown and developed maturity over the years; seeing life in a slightly different light. It was wonderful to see these characters grow, to see that they are not confined by the limited time that was only given to them in the previous film; here we get to see more of them as human beings rather than timeless icons and symbols.\n\nIt was the spontaneity and unpredictability of love and romance that caught me off guard and deeply affected me from the first film; Before Sunset has that heavy element in its arsenal, it simply doesn't fire as explosive as it does in the first film; Before Sunrise was eventful, little moments occurring throughout their date that would raise larger questions of not just their relationships but of themselves. The film does the same here but it lingers on a particular moments or topic for far too long, feeling a bit exhausted in almost every transition.\n\nIt is that sense of nostalgia and reflection that lingers throughout their story, on how one's life has led a certain way because of a particular circumstance, the feelings of regret and guilt over a single decision; the big IF is constantly in the minds of its characters, and even their time together here would be their last yet again, at least this time they would do it right.\n\nThe performances in this film are familiar but also different, as these characters have grown and so did the actors; letting their expanded wisdom and ability to act affect the way they shape their roles. Hawke still has that cool and romantic attitude in his performance, but a sense of maturity and growth if found in the way he conveys his ideas towards it; a sense of logic is more present in the way he reacts to things, but without losing that spontaneous quality about him. Delpy has also changed, showing a more opinionated and firm take on the character, but ensuring the foundations of the character that we found in the previous film is still present. There was a scene by Delpy during the end where she plays a song for Jesse, that scene was one of the most beautiful moments to be ever graced in cinema; it felt so tender and heartfelt, without relying on clich\u00e9d long stares within one another's eyes or a one-liner that would manipulatively make our hearts melt; it was simply beautiful.\n\nBefore Sunset may not be a better film than its predecessor, but it is still a great film; featuring that iconic walk and talk style that drove the first film, and a return of the characters that we have once adored and cherished, learning more about them and their opinions of the world that we currently live in.",

            "content": "9 years after the truly enchanting Before Sunrise came out, Richard Linklater returned with Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke to create a sequel, featuring the same two characters almost a decade later. So how could the same combination work together to produce something thematically similar yet new enough to warrant what is basically a sequel? Simple: the theme is life and love, and then you evolve exactly in the way that life and love does.\n\nThis time the story continues in Paris, and what the makes story worth watching is that Jesse and Celine are different people now. A lot has happened in nine years and is it all gradually unfolds Before Sunset proves itself to be quite a different viewing experience to its predecessor, Before Sunrise. In some ways, it is even better.\n\nBefore Sunset is not afraid to get more hefty than the first film. For all it's realistic dialogue, Before Sunrise can be accused of being overly idealistic. It really is a perfect night in Vienna. Before Sunset drops this. The characters of Jesse and Celine are older, debatably wiser and definitely more cynical. The first half of the film is withdrawn, as the characters would be having not seen each other for 9 years. The interaction naturally unfolds, and unlike Before Sunrise, there are tonal shifts this time as things get slightly more tense.\n\nThere are structural differences too. Before Sunrise was also a highlight reel of the best moments in Vienna, whereas Before Sunset is arguably entirely presented in real time. Before Sunrise was a whole night together, but this time Jesse is pressed for time and they only have a couple of hours. In these ways Before Sunset is very much in the same vein, but also a purely different film.\n\nHawke and Delpy are perfect again. It makes you wonder how of of the character and dialogue is drawn from real experience. Everything spoken fits with the people we know from the first film. The takes are really long this time, up to 10 minutes of fluent conversation whilst walking through the streets of Paris. The film makes you realise that it's about so much more than love, and this retrospectively changes my interpretation of the first film as well. Love is an integral part of life, and so a departure from that idea can be merely seen as an exploration of the greater picture rather than turning one's back on the first film.\n\nNo one knows this world better than the actors and director (who cowrite the script), so who are we to question whether they can keep up the realism of the series - its defining trait. Before Sunset proves that they can, with beautiful results.\n\nCoda: A different and maybe improved version of Before Sunrise, Before Sunset deserves to sit next to its accomplished brother. In some ways they even serve to complete each other.\n\nRead more at rabsi1.weebly.com/film/",

Nine years after the events of \"Before Sunrise\", Celine and Jesse meet again, this time spending a day in Paris. It's so interesting seeing the paths of these characters cross once again. As with the first film, it's a very simple presentation. You're literally just watching them interact with one another for an hour and half. That's the beauty of it though. Again, the dialogue is incredible and feels so real. The chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is still fantastic, really the best I've ever seen. This second installment is simply perfect.",

The concept of the sequel being after nine years and the actors having aged nine years in real life is so cool, also it being one continues shot of interaction between the two leads is so original(the time elapsed in the story is the run time of the film). Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are more likable as they are older, the script is more mature and kind of perfect (well they spends years fine tuning it). There is not even a single dull moment in the movie. One of the best Romantic movies I have seen with an amazing ending.",

            "content": "Nine years after the romantic one night stand viewers were part in, in Linklater's Masterpiece \"Before Sunrise\", this sequel tries to establish a second encounter between this two not-anymore strangers. I was pretty skeptical from the beginning feeling that \"Before Sunrise\" is an amazing standalone film. Well, \"Before Sunset\" is very good, but never quite reaches the heights of the first one.\n\"Before Sunset\" changes focus. What first was a love story, is now a more playful, raunchy re-encounter between two people who had some kind of past. The jokes are meaner, and the wittiness unfortunately decreases, but the film also improves on the laughs and also the drama involved in not seeing someone, in getting married, etc. Once again, Linklater proves to be master at showing what time does to people, in this case, to people who were in love. I also enjoyed how everything in this sequel seems to bring back to that special night in Viena the viewers had. The tounge-to-cheek script along with the always alluring Paris makes for intricate, fun and utterly enjoyable viewing.\nEverything in \"Sunset\", however, feels more set up than in \"Sunrise\". In the original film, the meeting of this two strangers was very much random, so is their day at Viena. In here, the encounter seems to be much more planned, and even the places they visit seem to be synthetically set up. The film relies on the chemistry of the protagonist and the dialogue they are having for you to not see the backgrounds, but that sort of freelance feeling made the original so great. And knowing now this turned out to be a trilogy, makes the ending of this middle chapter much more meaningful, although honestly, it can't escape its middle chapter feel. However, this is superior to many romantic comedies out there, and also has that Woody Allen-esque feel that makes it particularly delicious to bite into. \"Before Sunset\" is a sweet treat that is only kept restrained by the shadow of its superior predecessor.",

            "content": "Picking up from the unanswered questions of Before Sunrise, Before Sunset finds Jesse and Celine at older, more mature roles. I loved Before Sunrise for its enduring dialogues and everything left unsaid between Celine and Jesse. But I think Before Sunset is more beautiful, reinforcing everything about Before Sunrise in a beautiful, more melancholic way. Though most of the movie is characterized by cynicism as compared to the dreamy optimism of Before Sunrise, the ending seems more hopeful.\n\nBefore Sunrise and Before Sunset are beautiful reminders of why we love, how hard we try to find love and how frenzied we are in its pursuit, but how, once we find it, we're ar peace with the person. Both movies are about that inner peace you find when you know you're with that one person you can love like no other. Before Sunset endures longer than Before Sunrise, because melancholia has a way of connecting people more than wistfulness.",
