            "content": "The storyline was well-crafted and engaging, and the characters were dynamic and likable. The animation was superb, and the action scenes were thrilling and kept me on the edge of my seat.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of the movie was its humor. The dialogue was clever and witty, and the comedic timing was spot on. It was enjoyable to see the family dynamic of the Parrs, also known as the Incredibles, and how they balanced their superpowers with their daily lives.\n\nThe voice acting was also fantastic, with notable performances from Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible and Holly Hunter as Elastigirl. The rest of the cast, including Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone and Jason Lee as the villainous Syndrome, also did a great job bringing their characters to life.",

It pulls off having hilarious writing at times while still also being able to be serious. Definitely a must watch for anyone, fan of superhero films or not.",

            "content": "The story of the Incredibles focuses mostly on Bob and Helen Parr, former superheroes that are trying to adapt to a post-superhero life. The reason for this plays on the often real world consequences of Good Samaritans being attacked by a lawsuit-happy culture, an interesting and relatable theme. When Bob's identity of being a former superhero is discovered by a mysterious benefactor offering him a job, the tone shifts from the monotonous everyday life to a sort of spy thriller, a very unexpected, but welcome take for the superhero story. Bob's quote, \"They keep creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity\", is an excellent example of the film's theme of the risk of holding the exceptional back. This all culminates in an explosive ending battle, though the resolution afterward drags a little. The setup and payoff is very well done, never feeling cheap or dumb. The plot stays grounded and believable. Rules of superpowers are established and adhered to. The overall tone and themes are mature with onscreen death occurring, but it's all handled tastefully for younger audiences. Coincidences rarely occur, but when they do, it's done in a way that doesn't feel like the scene could've only worked if it played out that particular way. Even nitpicking, it was hard to find much to complain about, the writing is simply air tight.\n\nCharacters are solid for the most part. So much of the everyday lives of Bob and Helen are realistically relatable, making it easy to latch onto them and their struggles. I feel the children could've used a little more attention to their arcs, though. And concerning the antagonist, Syndrome, it seemed odd to set up a sympathetic backstory for the villain and not capitalize on it in the long run. Though his quote, \"And when everyone is super; no one will be\", is consistent with theme of elevating mediocrity. This is all backed up by generally strong voice acting by the cast.\n\nFor a movie from 2004, the animation still holds up. The level of detail is amazing, down to the individual wrinkles and excellent facial expressions.\n\nThe run time is an astounding 2 hours, which is pretty rare for a animated movie. Generally, it doesn't drag, but there are points I questioned if anything would be lost with a bit of trimming. The post final battle is where the biggest sin lies in pacing. While I do like it when stories show a bit of aftermath, this seems to just go on slightly too long.\n\nThe soundtrack is easily up there as one of the more iconic ones, with a sort of spy or noir type tune playing, often not as bombastic as we are accustom to hearing in superhero movies. Sound design itself is solid with guns and explosions feeling like they have weight behind them.\n\nRepeated viewings are also worthwhile with a lot of foreshadowing and easter eggs littered through the movie. Plus, it's just plain entertaining.\n\nThe Incredibles is best summarized as exceptional, with evident care and attention to detail during its production. There are niggling points to be had, but they are so minor, most probably won't take notice. In an age where finding a remarkable superhero flic can prove to be difficult, this older animated take on the genre still feels fresh and unique to this day.",

I don't think it is Pixar's best, that's Toy Story, but it's certainly not the weakest, that's Cars though that was a worthy film as well. The animation is spot on, and just adds to the inventive feel of the film, and is helped enormously by an innovative plot that is the source of the film's originality. The story is very fast-paced, if perhaps a little slow to begin with, and the script is filled with humour to satisfy even the fussiest child. The characters are very well-done, thanks to the excellent voice cast, standouts are Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, and My Name is Earl's Jason Lee is a big surprise as the villain Syndrome. Brad Bird's Edna was a hoot too. The film however, does have two flaws, it is overlong and sometimes drags consequently, and it is a little too violent at times, the last half-hour especially. Overall, an excellent family film, not perfect, but anybody who's seen some of the Disney direct to video sequels, save one or two exceptions will agree that the Incredibles does a much better job at entertaining than they did. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",

However, besides it being a superhero movie, it's a great character drama about Bob Parr and his midlife crisis. So basically, it's about a guy going through a midlife crisis, but he's a superhero with a family full of superheros. Doesn't that just sound amazing? Cast: excellent. I mean come on, you got Samuel L Jackson in this movie, I don't need to explain it anymore. And this movie might have the best Pixar villain ever in Syndrome. It's technically a twist villain, but done in the best way possible. Honestly, nothing to complain about here. Is there no big emotional moment, no. But this movie doesn't really need that\u2026.at all. It's a must watch. Go to Disney+ and watch arguably the best animated movie ever made!",

But the one Pixar movie that completely stands out for me is the one made on the superheroes. I have watched The Incredibles about like, twenty times as far as I can remember (almost always in Hindi), I think I have lost count. And yet it interests me the same way as it did the first time. It's clearly because of all the hard work that went into making this movie.\n\nThe first time I had heard about The Incredibles, it was when it had a Happy Meal toy ad. I used to hate Violet and like Dash because of how that ad used to show her as someone who bosses him around. The reason why it did so was because it reminded me so much of my family, minus Jack Jack. The father, the mother, the elder sister and the younger brother. The entire theme of this movie is that this is supposed to be a family of superheroes. They are also people just like us, living their life in peace and quiet. It is also visible since they easily blended in with the normal people the moment they got outlawed. This clearly showed that the way we always treat them to be either gods or demons, they are more than just that.\n\nAnother great aspect about this movie is the animation. It is the reason why I liked to watch this movie over and over again. Now of course all American animated movies have great animations, but this is something completely different. It looks and feels more like a videogame. As a kid I used to often play with my Wii remote when Bob broke into Syndrome's lab, pretending it's a game and I'm controlling him. The textures, the way Omnibot moves around, the fight scenes, everything gives a very videogame-like feel to it, something similar to the PS4 Spider-Man or Batman Arkham.\n\nAnd finally what makes this movie so great is the story and the character development. What made the Parrs so likeable? Because each of those characters are lousy, incompetant and just overall bored of their lives in the beginning of the movie. They have everything they need to make their lives fun, but they have no right to use them. So finally when they slowly get to use those powers, they are getting more excited about it and quickly adapt to the situations. In the aftermath of their fight they have made their lives better because now they are a lot more positive about their future.\n\nThe Incredibles, in my opinion, is a timeless classic. Everyone should definitely see this once in their life. It's one of the movies that absolutely defines what Disney-Pixar is. I'm really glad this movie got all the fame it deserved, and probably a lot more is to come in the future (games, cameos, spinoffs, even more sequels) since I just can't have enough of this.",

Bird's script takes super powered beings and forces them to integrate into everyday society resulting in realistic family dynamics and funny gags about especially gifted people attempting to live a normal life.\n\nBird's direction is very tender, clearly coming from a place of love, respect, and reverence for the wonderment superheroes bring to children and adults alike as he parodies Superman, Mister Fantastic, The Flash, and The Invisible Woman for The Incredibles. The slick 3D animation looks so alive and expressive. Mr. Incredible is weary and vulnerable, Elastigirl is sincere and worried, Violet is shy and uncertain of herself, and Dash is frustrated and bears an inner rage so he lashes out. Bird creatively directs The Incredibles as a fast paced, old school heroic adventure. Brad Bird knows how to direct a heartfelt film from The Iron Giant and Ratatouille to The Incredibles.\n\nPatrick Lin, Janet Lucroy, and Andrew Jimenez' cinematography is striking with lava walls, watery ocean paths, dim caves, and lush forests shot in magnificent panning wide shots. Their intimate close-ups work wonders on revealing character emotions and feelings in a natural way. Lou Romano's production design feels like he's drawing from anything from Superman to The Rocketeer and Dr. No. Rey Bohol's minimalist set decorations look like a neat futuristic world that's similar enough to feel cozy at home. The Incredibles is so thoughtfully made, it's a miracle it feels so organic and sincere.\n\nMichael Giacchino's score is a cool tribute to old Hollywood and classic superhero themes. His classical and jazz blend feels like he harkens back to another era entirely bringing The Incredibles' modern themes into the eternal hall of great heroes.\n\nStephen Schaffer's editing is so crafty in how he slickly cuts from sequence to sequence. He makes The Incredibles 115 minutes pass by like a sweet, quiet afternoon.\n\nI love Craig T. Nelson boisterous and earnest vocal performance as Mr. Incredible. He adds a paternal warmth and sincerity to The Incredibles. Holly Hunter is so realistic and down to Earth as Elastigirl. She plays the role as more than a reluctant heroine but a devoted wife and mother. Her marital conversations and spousal fights with Mr. Incredible are very realistic and feel like parents actually arguing.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the classic icy hero Frozone. Jason Lee is great as the vindictive fanboy Syndrome. He's a great cautionary tale of being kind, but friendly to your fans. While he also represents the foolish arrogance of a man with delusions of grandeur and no concept of living in reality. Spencer Fox is fun as a confident and excitable Dash. Wallace Shawn's cameo as Mr. Incredible's ruthless and heartless insurance boss is so perfect it's unreal. Sarah Vowell is dreamy as the shy emo girl Violet, who still feels relatable no matter how many times I watch The Incredibles.\n\nElizabeth Pena, may she forever rest in paradise, is perfectly cast as the sultry assistant to Syndrome enigmatically entitled Mirage. Eeyore himself, Bud Luckey voices the elderly lawyer Rick very aptly. \n\nI have to mention the best voice casting is actually director Brad Bird himself as the eccentric superhero fashion designer Edna Mode. She's clearly a fun combination of Anna Wintour, Coco Chanel, and Karl Lagerfeld.\n\nI cannot recommend Brad Bird's The Incredibles enough! Your entire family will love it!",

The Incredibles won two Academy Awards for Best Animations & Best Sound Editing.\n\nThe story was charming, focused, and well structured; you really felt like things were on the line every step of the way. Bird did a great job writing a witty and super fun script, while also creating these enjoyable characters, with great voice overs! In this rare occasion with three directors of photography, in Janet Lucroy, Patrick Lin, & Andrew Jimenez, everything seemed flawless, with great animated detail.\n\nThe music & score by Michael Giacchino, was very up beat, entertaining, and enjoyable, that fit perfect with every scene. Other than My Brother The Pig, this was Giacchino first real big test, and he passed with flying colors.\n\nOverall, this was a very charming, family film, that packs a lot of weight, while setting up great for the sequel.",

There were no musical numbers and it was nearly two hours long.

It has been acclaimed in the years since by critics as one of the best films of the 2000s but I did not want to view the film from a snobby perspective as I often do and wanted to see it as I had when I was a child without comparing it to other films or considering whether it is \u2018important' enough to be considered a great film. When judged purely on whether or not it entertains the film is a stellar achievement.\n\nWhat I was struck by was that the film is actually a great exploration of the impact that a mid life crisis can have on a family and how adults returning to what they love can make them better spouses and parents. There is the fairly adult scene in which Susan discovers a long blonde hair on one of her husband's shirts and I realized that the implication is that he has had an affair. Fortunately the film does not dwell on this particular detail and smartly decides to show that more than cheating he is wronging his wife by neglecting her emotional needs. The disconnect between husband and wife is shown to have a negative influence on their children as even Violet, who I closely identified with as a young woman, is disturbed by the lack of closeness in her parent's marriage. Marital struggles are something that every couple goes through but with the added pressure of raising children it is difficult to prioritize the needs of your partner and of yourself. This is a film that gets that and while not everybody will fall in love again while being a superhero this role could serve as an analogy for any hobby or passion that a disgruntled spouse might have. There are times when every person needs to relax and focus on what often means most to them, their family, and this is a film that portrays this with an impressive subtlety.",

However, once the film becomes more serious it kinda loses its edge for me. When it's less so though, it's good. The animation is very nice, even if the humans look a tad iffy especially with their expressions.\n\nAnother part I don't love is the villain, Syndrome. I feel like he's a bit tame, I never once felt fear/angst from the guy at all. A much more devilish, deceptive bad guy would've been far better. I didn't even realise it's Jason Lee who voices him either, it oddly doesn't sound like Lee to me.\n\nTalking of mishearing the voice cast, am I the only one who thought it was Jodie Foster voicing Elastigirl? Violet kinda sounds like Aubrey Plaza too. I think I may need my ears tested... Elsewhere, it's cool to hear (correctly, this time) Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is certainly a film worth watching 100%. I just would've loved a greater threat to the protagonists. Lastly, the end scenes, though amusing, feel like a collective of end credit jokes rolled into one. That's a minor complaint, mind.",

The mother just trying to keep the family together and have everyone live a normal life to stay out of trouble. And the evil villain who seeks nothing more than to obsessively stay in control at the expense of others. At the end of the day, the family that is there for each other's backs makes the real triumph, though Mr Incredible may not realize his family's importance as first, which is what makes us relate to this film and follow it across its tense, action-packed sequences. The film still though manages to be filled with smart comedy (I LOVED Edna). However, though all of these make the film super entertaining, I did feel at times that the film's message didn't quite punch as great as it could have on its timely messages, at times reverting too much to its action sequences just to keep its audience hooked. This of course is a personal opinion, which doesn't mask the FACT that this film is definitely worth a watch,",

The film stars Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible and Holly Hunter as Elastigirl.\n\nThe voice acting is really believable and works with the characters really well. I also liked Brad Bird as Edna \"E\" Mode I felt that he gave a charming, but comedic portrayal.\n\nThe characters are some of the best and most memorable characters that Pixar has ever made. The family dynamic in my opinion works really well sadly they don't build on it as much as I wanted.\n\nThe film surprisingly has some very good cinematography especially for an animated film. \n\nThe animation like most Pixar films is great and some of the best I've ever seen. I especially like the look of the human characters compared to the oldet models from Pixar.\n\nThe setting I personally very much like with a world in which supers aren't aloud to save the day.\n\nThe style of the film like most Brad Bird films is really good from the character design to the colour scheme.\n\nThe film also has lots of action compered to the rest of the Pixar films. The action is done very well, but most of the time the action doesn't have consequences. \n\nThe dialogue like most Pixar films is good and steady with some quotable lines.\n\nThe film also has a very good score that fits with the film really nicely.\n\nThe story follows Bob A.K.A Mr. Incredible a man who has given up his superhero ways after a new law comes in to place. At this point he's bored with his life and wants to go back to his glory days. Until one day he gets a secret message.\n\nThe film also has some very good comedy that has me laughing out loud.\n\nThe film at points also has some very good atmosphere especially toward the beginning with Mr. Incredible.  \n\nThe film is so enjoyable that I can watch it again and again and never get tired of it.\n\nThe film does have a couple problems, but most of them are just nit picks that barley take away.\n\nOver all I give it a 9/10 - second best Pixar film as of right now",

            "content": "Strengths: This movie is a case of Pixar doing what they do best. They crafted a story around something interesting and nailed all the little things to make it special and unique. I appreciated how this is a kids movie but with adult themes. The whole reason the superheroes must go into hiding began because someone didn\u00e2(TM)t want to be saved from his attempted suicide. That\u00e2(TM)s dark. I think it worked very well. Brad Bird did a wonderful job with the set pieces, giving this more action than most live action superhero movies. The writing is sharp and the characters are all well developed, even if a little stereotypical at points. Most of the voice cast is good. Craig T. Nelson (Bon Parr/Mr. Incredible), Holly Hunter (Helen Parr/Elastigirl), Samuel L. Jackson (Lucius Best/Frozone), Sarah Vowell (Violet Parr), and Jason Lee (Buddy Pine/Syndrome) stand out. We get a good villain and a well put together score. The animation also ranks right near the top in terms of the high quality work Pixar has done.\n\nWeaknesses: There are a few small things that bug me. When Violet helps her family escape from being Syndrome\u00e2(TM)s captives, it feels way too easy and unearned. It should have meant more. There are moments, here or there, where a bit more time and care could\u00e2(TM)ve been given. I also wish the second battle would have been against something different than just a better version of the robot Mr. Incredible beat alone earlier in the film.  \n\nOverall: One of the better animated films ever made. It has heart, is funny, features likable characters, and is imaginative. There\u00e2(TM)s not much more you can ask for.",

After re-watching it (again) recently I seem to have noticed that the film is just a complete masterpiece. The story of the film is compelling and captivating, and the storyline is a very unique and interesting idea that perhaps done something new with superhero movies, with the new idea of having superheroes banned, this has created a very extraordinary plot with new elements. Because of the condition in superhero work, the work of the protagonist had to be undisclosed to the public which also created the conflict of familial issues, such as the miscommunication between him and his family. Because of this the film wasn't only a superhero movie, it was a touching, family film where the characters eventually reach a consensus and become a functional family to defeat the villain. Each of the characters have story arcs and character growth which was very satisfying to watch as they all reached a unifying idea and perspective of the world from the experience, this was made especially well from the story telling method and how we are able to see multiple events happening at the same time from different character's perspective. However, in the very end the family comes together and completes their story arc. \n\n\tAs for the villain of the film, Syndrome posed as a very intimidating and spine-chilling villain, he was relatable and understandable. His character origins were blended into the film very well and the twist villain that Syndrome was the boy Bob met so long ago was unexpected and surprising. When we see the villain we understand his actions and almost persuades the audience to his side, which was a great job from the writers and Lee. Overall, the film has ben very entertaining, albeit disguised as a superhero movie, the context behind their actions about the familial conflicts and compelling moral made the movie have depth.",

            "content": "The Incredibles 1: The Incredibly Fantastic Precursor to Incredibles 2 \nWhat was prolific about the year 2004? To start with, the Kardashians had not yet hit the entertainment scene, Batman was simply Batman not Ninja Batman and had probably not met Scooby Dooby Doo yet. It is also the same year that the \"Incredibles\" superhero family hit the silver screens. The family is composed of four members; a couple and their two school going children and a yet-to-be awoken toddler.  What is most interesting about the film is how the director who also happens to have been the writer blends the concept of family with tights wearing personalities. \nThe film begins with an introductory scene of a younger Mr. Incredible playing the beloved though careless hero, combating evil. As far as accidents go, for one person saved there are a couple of individuals who end up hurt. He is just one unlucky individual. His heroic exploits result in numerous court appearances with him as the defendant. In one instance, he saves a man from committing suicide, only for the suicidal individual to sue for injuries sustained during the rescue mission. In another he stops a train that had derailed only for all the passengers to suffer and sue for various \"serious\" injuries incurred during the stop.  The sad occurrences in the form of accidents and the like result in an acrimonious relationship between him and the people; and crooks looking for a payout take advantage of such to launch suits against Mr. Incredible and other superheroes. \nIn the end all superheroes are forced to stop their heroics and settle for normal lives. Fifteen years an all grown Mr. Incredible is married to a heroine, Elastigirl (elastic powers). They assume the names Bob Parr and Helen Traux as they fit their normal lives. He takes up a job as a \"fair\" insurance adjuster who is always in his boss' crosshairs for not pushing the clients enough. In despair he cries, \"They keep finding new ways to celebrate mediocrity. Their children are true scions of the supernatural bloods. Dylan, their son has super speed but cannot use it in school because he would not be 'normal'. Their daughter Violet is able to shrink, turn invisible and channel bubbles of force fields. It is in the fifteenth year that Mr. Incredible starts playing hero in secret with his old-time hero friend ice-blasting Frozone. Their hidden antics are revealed when they take up a challenge to save an island from robots, a ruse planned by his former charge, Buddy Pine known as Syndrome. After Mr. Incredible is captured it is left to his family to come to the rescue.\nHelen a micromanager of sorts decides to go save her husband, with the kids out of the picture. She gets a plane to the island, but with a shocker awaiting her. The kids got wind of her plane and stowed on the plane. Syndrome also gets wind of the plane's arrival and sends robot to destroy it which they do successfully. This episode marks the first family team effort. Violet uses her force-field bubbles to protect her family from the impact of the destroyed plane. Dylan uses his super-speed to get the family to the island unnoticed. Meanwhile, Syndrome loses control of his main robot, omnidroid which he leaves to fight the family. Through wit, The Incredibles manage to beat the omnidroid through making it tear itself apart.  Syndrome, having lost his powers attempts to kidnap Jack-Jack, the Parr's toddler in order to raise him as his own charge/sidekick. The plan fails miserably after Jack-jack transforms into lead, fire then a monster, managing to destroy Syndrome's escape ship, which leads to his death too. \nPixar animation Studios has made its mark in computer generated animation movies techniques. The Toy Story series are proof enough of this. In the area of visual effects, Pixar performed extremely well in the creation of the Incredibles. The visual effects add up to the fun of the character personas. If it's not the explosions then it's the slips and the warped No apparent mistakes as one would expect of a most pre-2008 animation movies. In creating this film they manage to set the whole story on a whole different sector in terms of color, liveliness and natural integration.\n Brad Bird deserves an applause for the film. It would be hard to tell in which area he deserves more applause for between the writing and the directing. The voice artists also do a good job considering that most of them were relatively unknown and new to the major film voice acting scene. The three most renowned voices are those of Craig Nelson for Mr. incredible, Holly Hunter for Elastigirl, and Samuel Jackson for Frozone.\nWatching the movie, I found Frozone to be the most impressive even though he plays a small role in the whole plot. Considering the voice behind Frozone, the character is quite funny too, trying to be domineering without being domineering. As sum total the movie is worth every minute of its screen play. With its sequel already showing, there is no doubt that with the same stance, it is likely to perform well at the box office.  Not watched the original Incredibles? Get it before watching the sequel and do not ask how they came into being. We don't know either.",

            "content": "Quick Review: There's been a lot of filmmakers that I haven't been able to over the years catch a lot of their main filmography with, and director Brad Bird for whatever reason has been one of those people despite the many critically acclaimed and widely pop cultured animated films he's made. Which means despite his Mission Impossible film (which I thought was incredibly solid and entertaining throughout) and Tomorrowland (which left a bitter taste in my mouth thanks to David Lindelofs involvement, who i don't personally like at al and who also forced Brad Bird to not do Star Wars which he was close to doing, despite solid direction and interesting world building and story ideas) his other acclaimed animated feats have flown over my radar; but with the sequel release to todays review just hitting theaters I figured it was finally time to sit down and watch The Incredibles to see how i'd feel about it. And I can happily say after watching it that it went beyond what was i expecting; that being an incredibly enjoyable and almost amazing film with a lot of surprising engaging and uniqueness to its world building and twist on the superhero storyline. And i'm happy to say besides just some bare nitpicks such as with its animation not holding up as much, the ending and especially some resolutions to the characters arcs feeling a little cliche and predictable, and the only one major complaint wishing the film could be more longer and slower paced to fully explore its genuinely interesting themes and develop some of the even more interesting main heroes character arcs, I would say these don't do merely enough to hurt the films otherwise very heavy and outstanding positives coming from a very talented VA cast who add a lot of likability and enjoyability to their characters, a very jazzy and energetic score by my favourite composer Michael Giacchino who really brings out a lot of style and some memorable as hell leitmotif and melodies, a shockingly well structured and engaging story that manages to be unique and interestingly bleak and depressing but still engaging and fun for anyone to watch on, some really fun side characters that help give a lot of the humour and world building some nice fun escapism, the main characters all feeling really well written and given lots of great moments to shine on their own and surprisingly very sympathetic character arcs, well balanced script and tone that helps keep the story being affective despite mixing a lot of tones very well, and of course lastly the absolutely wonderful dark but fun world building that I think without accompanying this story would've felt very almost by the numbers.\n\nSo overall i'm happy to say that for Brad Birds first film for Pixar, and continuation after what i'm sure must of felt pressure from everyone to live up to the emotional heights of The Iron Giant, was definitely nothing short of something genuinely unique and honestly really well put together; In a lot of ways being one of those Pixar films next to Wall-E, Finding Nemo, Up, and you can argue a lot of other of their originals that really use a lot of creativity and dark world building with fun or emotionally engaging stories to be timeless classics. Definitely recommend seeing it if you haven't, and for me now that Brad Bird has shown me he really can animate super well here's hoping his other features (including the sequel to this) can hopefully show me a lot more of what he's capable of. \n\nScore: 8.5 / 10",

With incredibly beautiful computer animation for the standards of the time, the incredible was the longest computer-generated animation until its release, plus a good rhythm, and a magnificent soundtrack that brings us to a mix of Batman and Superman, a soundtrack that screams \"THIS IS A SUPER-HEROI MOVIE\". We have a great construction of characters, characters that are broken several times, that reflect, give up and try, involved in family dramas and search for self-knowledge, the film talks about the nature of man to seek a meaning to his life. It's a very good movie, with dialogues, script, characters and technically high level.",

The time of the movie is retro-futuristic, in a suburban life.\nBob Parr and his wife, Helen Parr are the world's greatest famous superheroes in Metroville. But fifteen years later, they have been forced to adopt civilian identities and retreat to that suburb where they have no choice but to retire as superheroes to live a \"normal life\", with their three children Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack. They were secretly born with super powers. Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top secret assignment. He soon discovers that it will take a super family effort to rescue the world from the total destruction, caused by Syndrome.\nThe plot seems very gripping, unpredictable and full of action.\nThe special effects are achieved and inventive thanks to a lot of imagination on the part of the directors. \nThe billing of this film is really colored, gripping, and incredible.\nThis film is really full of energy, action but also funny and moving. The characters are very endearing and colorful.\nThe script is full of twists and suspense. The dialogues are funny and powerful. The script doesn't look the easy way out.\nGenerally, I find this film very entertaining. I recommend this film to anyone who loves action and superheroes. A good entertainment to whole the family.",

            "content": "When I've heard that Disney's Pixar's The Incredibles is coming out I was watching a teaser trailer where Bob Parr is putting his superhero suit on, he can't put his belt on because he's fat. That's the only teaser trailer I've seen in the past years. When it came out it was massive. The critics loved it and audience loved it like my friends and myself. This is the only Pixar film that could ever get an PG rating because of it's violence and most kids enjoyed it for it's humor, load of fun and fast paced action. When I watched The Incredibles I almost felt that this movie is almost seem so adult. Why do I say that? Well, for a movie that made kids understand the action and violence for it's wittiness and heart, this movie will understand the prejudice of making the action scenes so fast paced to make the animation look so funny for younger audience to laugh to have some comedy to it. This does what Pixar was supposed to do. Most of my friends enjoyed it, including Joe Morris, Wasim Bullock and Nathan Tolson. Of course we've been quoting some lines from it. The only scene where my friends remember is the scene where Bob Parr is in Gilbert Huph's office. He was voiced by Wallace Shawn the same guy who voiced Rex from the Toy Story troligy.\n\nThe dialogue where these two says in this scene:\n\nSit down, Bob.\nI'm not happy, Bob. Not happy. Ask me why.\nOkay. Why?\nWhy what? Be specific, Bob.\nWhy are you unhappy?\nYour customers make me unhappy.\nWhy? Have you gotten complaints?\nComplaints I can handle. What I can't handle is your customers' inexplicable knowledge of Insuricare's inner workings. They're experts! Experts, Bob! Exploiting every loophole! Dodging every obstacle! They're penetrating the bureaucracy!\nDid I do something illegal?\nNo.\nAre you saying we shouldn't help our customers?\nThe law requires that I answer no.\nWe're supposed to help people!\nWe're supposed to help *our* people! Starting with our stockholders, Bob! Who's helping them out, Huh?\nYou know, Bob... a company...\nIs like an enormous clock.\n...Is like an enormous cl... Yes, precisely. It only works if all the little cogs mesh together. A clock must be clean, well lubricated, and wound tight. The best clocks have jewel movements cogs that fit that cooperate by design. I'm being metaphorical, Bob. Do you know what I mean by cooperative cogs? Bob? Bob? Look at me when I'm talking to you, Parr!\nThat man out there, he needs help!\nDo not change the subject, Bob! We're discussing your attitude!\n*He* is getting *mugged*!\nWell let's hope we don't cover him!\nI'll be right back.\nStop right now, or you're fired!\nClose the door.\nGet over here now.\nI'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.\nHe got away.\nGood thing, too. You were this close to losing your jo...\nUh-oh.\n\nNow that's the only scene that my friends ever loved! There are many of the scenes me and my friends been quoting but that's only about it. The only thing this movie has is it's wonderfully written story that really does fit for the company that really makes superhero films that **wasn't** Marvel but Disney made this movie a well-made animated action adventure kids film that really make adults enjoy for it's witty humor. The cast is also make the characters look more likable. There's Craig T. Nelson as Bob Parr aka. Mr Incredible, Holly Hunter as Helen Parr aka. Elastigirl, yours truly Samuel L. Jackson as Lucius Best aka. Frozone and then there's Jason Lee as Buddy aka. Syndrome, the evil superhero villain who kills superhero's. He also named Incrediboy as he was a kid. There's a videogame based on the film which is released the same time in 2004. Kinda enjoyed it. The Incredibles is one of the best animated Pixar films ever made. Most of my friends enjoyed it and I do, too. There are so many films that are going to be made by a company who makes best and greatest animated films ever to be put on screen and that is Pixar. This is one of my favourite if not the favourite Pixar film of all time. It really **is** one of my favourite films of all time along with Toy Story and Toy Story 2. It proves all Disney fans that every minute the enjoyment comes out, it really does come out. It proves that animation can be mature for most Disney and Pixar fans and the Incredibles have alot of beautiful animation, great characters, mature humor and fast paced action scenes and a wonderfully well written story. This is definitely the most fast paced movie that had everything so fast paced! This movie is just awesome! Now, don't forget, there's a sequel coming out which is in 2018 is a long awaited sequel that is going to charm up the fans of the first Incredibles and superhero flicks and bring the enjoyment to life. This movie will ever be remembered by fans, my friends and all the people around. I've seen the teaser trailer of The Incredibles 2 on Facebook is will be released next year in the year 2018.\nStay Tuned.",

            "content": "The Incredibles is the pinnacle of superhero animation. Not to mention this is my favourite Pixar animation, this is also my favourite superhero film. A genre that is ridiculously exhausted now, The Incredibles took superheroes and made them relatable, human...and damn likeable. They are just like us, with families and a desire to do good in the world. Sure they have powers that neither me, you or the pet cat have, but it was refreshing to watch the day-to-day lives of a super heroic family. The family we follow is the Parr family, in particular the focus is on Mr Incredible. Washed up, old and trying to earn a living, he desires to be the famed superhero that he once was. Where to begin with this? Outstanding animation, perfect voice casting, memorable characters, inventive plot and one of the most quotable scripts of all time. There is no way anyone can hate on this film, no way. Every character is superb, from the charming Parr family to the villainous Syndrome (who by the way, is your biggest fan...). But the champion is the one, the only...Edna Mode. Every scene with her, is comedic genius. Where her spinoff film? I would pay top dollar to see that! The script is phenomenally quotable and plagued with famous scenes. \"Where's my super suit!?\", \"No capes!!\", \"Go home buddy, I work alone.\" and a personal favourite \"Coincidence? I think NOT!\". Consistently funny, witty and charming, you don't get scripts like these in every family film. The plot was engrossing with no pointless scenes, the pacing was rapid and builds up to the final battle sequence. The superpowers were creative, heck even the baby has some damn awesome superpowers. A baby!? When was the last time you saw that in a film? Oh and Samuel L Jackson was perfect voice casting for Frozone, without a doubt. In my opinion, drum roll please, Pixar haven't exceeded with an animation since The Incredibles. This being one of my favourite films of all time, this is a super duper ridiculously easy perfect rating. Where's my sequel? I need it now.",

            "content": "We've seen a family of superheroes before; a group of people with extraordinary abilities teaming up to take on a common threat. But what if the family of superheroes were an actual family? Enter 2004's \"The Incredibles\", an animated action movie that does a great job at capturing the heroics of said family. But that doesn't mean that there are problems with the film; we'll get to them later. Yet, the movie is handled very well in its execution of its subject matter. \"The Incredibles\" is an interesting depiction at superheroes that has a good premise and execution, yet it still falls short on the heroics.\n\nThe story involves a family of superheroes: the Parr's. Each of them have a heroic ability attached to them, i.e super strength, flexibility, etc. The head of the household, Bob, is a superhero under the name Mr. Incredible. Unfortunately, the government has put a ban on superheroes, as they see their \"heroics\" as an excuse to witness collateral damage to the city being done. In turn, the heroes must give up what they do- serving the public- and lead normal lives. Bob then gets a secret mission to regain his popularity, as well as bringing his self-esteem back. But what Bob uncovers, might not be super at all, and the villain's plan just might involve not only himself, but his family, too.\n\n\"The Incredibles\" is a good movie on a number of things. First off, the art style used for the basis on the animation provided here, is really good. This comes from writer and director Brad Bird, who based the movie's style as a mix up between 1950's and 1960's design. The latter is taken into more account here. All of the characters and background designs look like something from an artistic comic book, and it definitely works to the film's advantage here. All the animators at Pixar really put in a lot of effort into making this movie look and sound good Plus, going back to the 1960s, the music by Michael Giacchino invokes a feeling of James Bond, as well as the spy genre itself. On top of this, the acting in this movie is great; from Craig T. Nelson as Mr. Incredible, to even Jason Lee as the villainous Syndrome, everyone delivers a great performance with every character provided in the movie. Plus, the action is executed very well, and have interesting payoffs, most notably, the 100 yard dash, where the son, Dash, is running at super fast speed. Overall, \"The Incredibles\" handles its production smoothly and efficiently, so that everyone can understand and grasp at what's going on.\n\nWith that said, there are some major problems with the film. For starters, the movie goes on for way too long. The pacing is, for lack of a better word, incredibly slow, and there is a lot of build up that one has to wait in order to finally pay off. Another downgrade to the film is while the family aspect isn't too bad, the main focus is mostly put on Bob/Mr. Incredible. While this isn't to bad, as it shows both the father and husband aspect, the majority of the family doesn't really come into play until the last third of the movie. This all comes back to the problem with the pacing; at almost two hours, the entire production could have been cut by some amount.\n\nSo, is \"The Incredibles\" a perfect movie? No. There are a vast majority of problems concerning the pacing and the focus from Mr. Incredible. Does the movie work as a superhero flick? Yes, yes it does. There are a lot of good ideas and concepts being presented surrounding the topic of superheroes and family. And, for the most part, it works. In conclusion, \"The Incredibles\" treats the superhero genre very well, and it could have been perfect, had it gotten more focus on the family. But, we'll just have to wait for...",

Don't get me wrong he is a good villain but not the all time best villain I'd put him as my number 8 of my top 10 favourite villains.\nAnyways apart from syndrome being a kinda weak villain the rest of the movie is so good  like all the stuff I've said in this review earlier.\nWith all that said The Incredibles is a great super hero movie that makes it a original super hero movie like Big Hero 6 is and other super hero films not base off a comic book.

It's great that early in their career, Pixar strayed from regurgitating the same movie again and again (What if bugs had feelings? What if toys had feelings? What if cars had feelings?) and made a movie about PEOPLE, something (as right now, at least) I don't believe they're replicated, (unless you count Brave, which I haven't seen) and made a story about humans interacting and an all-around great superhero movie. If this movie was life action, which could've worked, although I must digress that the cartoonish character designs of say, Edna or Syndrome definitely made the film very enjoyable. Bob Parr is such a relatable character having a mid-life crisis, wants to be happy, but wants his wife and kids to have a life and support them and loves them while he longs for the glory days of Mr. Incredible... like how can someone not be intrigued by that? Yeah, maybe somethings in retrospect don't make sense (What the hell is Kronos??? Or did I miss something), but it's a very mature step for Pixar, and I really wish they made more movies like this instead of following up this movie with Cars....

            "content": "The Incredibles is a Disney-Pixar animation starring a voice cast which includes Craig T. Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Holly Hunter. After lawsuits bring disapproval of superhero presence, Mr. Incredible and his wife, Elastigirl, are forced to hang up their costumes in favor of ordinary lives. Years later, a familiar face begins killing off heroes one by one, and it's up to The Incredibles to stop him.\n\nThis is another solid and entertaining movie in Pixar's filmography. Brad Bird successfully pulls off the triple-threat of film-making, being credited as writer, director, and voice actor in his movie (his voice work as Edna steals the show). The soundtrack is as fun as it should be for this kind of movie - Michael Giacchino delivers big-time in this regard. The last 40 minutes of this movie really stands out, which is where my negatives start. After a solid opening cinematic showing the days of superhero glory, the movie drops off. While it's entertaining to see superpowered individuals struggle with mundane activities, it gets old after a couple scenes. The bulk of this movie is very void of action - there are even long sequences void of dialogue, which is tricky for a kid's movie. Since there really isn't much to the plot here, I feel like the run length could have been cut down by about 20 minutes to keep the momentum going into the final act, but multiple stealth scenes really drag this movie down. It's all worth sitting through to get to the excitement, though. Watching the kids embrace and develop their powers is thrilling.\n\nOverall, The Incredibles is a good movie. Despite many slow patches, there is entertainment value for the whole family, and the message about embracing your individuality resonates with its audience. Give this one a watch!\n\nFinal grade: B",

            "content": "\"The Incredibles\" was certainly an incredible way to start out the new year, and this film boasts the perfect blend of comedy and action, while solidifying itself as one of the best superhero movies to date. \n\nI was given this movie for Christmas, and it was probably one of the best movies I received that day. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I expected it to be, and it's definitely a movie that I will proudly display in my collection. \n\nSo we follow the story of a family of superheros who are well beyond their glory days of crime-fighting, and now, they are trying to find their place in society. What I really love about this movie is the amount of depth that it had. Not only will kids love this movie, but adults will relate so much to it. Our main protagonist, Mr. Incredible, has long been forgotten, and is now stuck working for an insurance company. What I really loved about his job was how it really brought out his personality, and it showed a lot about how much his past life has affected him. Even though he is stuck behind a desk, working in a cubicle, his caring personality and his desire to help others is shown in a couple of situations, and it really makes you relate to him even more. He doesn't neccesarily miss the good ole' days because it made him feel important, but also because he was able to help and care for others. Elastigirl was also a great character, as she was the one who was trying to help everyone fit in, but in the end, they were all destined to be superheros. Dash and Violet also gave plenty of depth and anchor to the story, as they were a humanizing and relatable element, and their growth throughout the movie as a family is awe-inspiring. I really love this movie because we get to watch these characters grow overtime, and the family dynamic makes this movie a whole lot better.\n\nConsidering this movie came out about 12 years ago, I can cut it a little bit of slack for its animations. The animations weren't always crisp and precise looking, and the background often looked TV worthy. But overall, this movie looks really good. I really like the textures on certain objects and the movement of the characters, and I can't wait to see what the new Incredible movie will bring us visually. A lot of credit should be given to the animators and the director for putting together a great story visually, and through writing, and the voice actors in this film were also fantastic. They were all able to bring the characters to life, and this film will strive throughout the decades.\n\nBrad Bird manages to deliver a perfect blend of comedy, action, and depth to his story here. There were plenty of moments where I was laughing, but there was never any toilet humor. It was all smart, realistic, and relatable humor because it's perfect for the situation. The action was always extremely entertaining, and I loved seeing this family fight together on screen. It was a sight to see, and hopefully in the next movie, we can see these characters going back into their prime so they can kick some ass. The depth to the story was surprisingly eccentric, and I loved every bit of it. We can relate to the situation ourselves in many ways, and the story was amazing. Even though \"Iron Man 3\" ripped it off, I still like this movie better.\n\nIn the end, this movie surely does live up to its name, and I loved every second of it. It was the perfect superhero movie, it had the perfect animation, and the perfect way to start out my new year.",

Yes the retro style, the brilliant script and the incredible score from Michael Giacchino - as well as some of the most amusing characters Pixar have ever dealt - amount to one of the most flat-out fun and comedic experiences I've ever had at the movies. Of course though, none of that would be the case without the baseline stuff to invest you in the first place, and there The Incredibles excels with a high-stakes story with some genuinely meaning?ful ideas that tie-in really nicely, and a whole roster of characters that not only bring the fun and personality, but also a genuine heart to the whole thing.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: The third act does loose some of the intelligence in pursuit of a more action-packed (if awesome) affair.\nVERDICT: Less simple than many Pixar ventures; The Incredibles truly lives up to its name as it takes the properly smart and whity route to success.",

But the villain is just a big clich\u00e9. There's no real understating behind him, no feeling either. He's just another evil-jealous villain. There're also bad and classic stereotypes throughout the movie, a real concern in my opinion, since Disney is a global phenomenon today. The Incredibles are also not that entertaining as what I expected to see, can't really pinpoint why but there are just so many superhero-movies nowadays so the old ones feels just old I guess. There are on the other hand many funny moments that both kids and grown-ups can enjoy and many of them are indeed highly rememberable. \n\n7.5/10",

Also, just movies in general. I think this is better than The Dark Knight, Edge Of Tomorrow, Gravity, and many others. \n\nIf it wasn't for Monsters Inc and a couple others, this would easily be my favorite movie of all time.

This movie also shows the how the character's acted like a real family, the son was like a class clown who spent time in the principals office, the daughter had relationship issues, the mother was a stay at home mom who takes care of the baby, and the father worked in a simple cubical. This movie was packed full of comedy, action, adventure, and mister all with make for an outstanding film.",

Reflecting back on the olden days.... So enough of this nostalgia bullshit, motherfuckers. ON TO THE REVIEW!\n\n The Incredibles is about a family WHO HAS TO FIGHT EVIL! OMG! HOW FUCKING SCARY!!!! Disney/Pixar movies are chilched and The Unincredibbles just shows that. It is filled with boring messages, boring humor, and lame action (aprrantley Pixar are to big a bunch of pussies to make PG-13). \n\n\nThe way this thing is executed just screams \"generic\" all over it. The plot is \"trust your family\" thing and nothing else. The humor is lame-ass slapstick. There is nothing new in this thing. Seriously. \n\nAnd... THAT'S IT!\n\n\n\n\nNow you may be wondering why my review is so short, and that is due to one fact: I am not writing LONG reviews for movies I don't care about as they waste my time.",

For my potential kids, if they really liked superheroes, I would most likely try to play The Incredibles for their entertainment. The Incredibles is a team and family of superheroes, in case you didn't get that. Mr. Incredible (Craig T Nelson) has super strength and super pecs, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) is a rubbery milf, Violet is an emo kid that can literally hide from the world and create a neat force field shield, Dash is a little brat that can travel at warp speed, and the baby is a baby... as far as you are concerned. In the glory days for Mr. Incredible, he had a reliable ally named Frozone (Samuel L Jackson), a dominatrix/boss named Edna (Brad Bird, also the director), and an annoying fan-turned-supervillain named Syndrome (Jason Lee). The plot is your old run-of-the-mill story about the villain trying to take over the world, and the heroes are there to stop that villain. Besides the fact that the superheroes are a family, this is not really a parody or clever take. It's just another superhero movie, like a family-friendly version of The Avengers. Syndrome does have a sympathetic cause for his rule. He wants everybody to feel super, by selling \"super\" powers to everybody. Syndrome looks for corporate dominance, more so than totalitarian dominance. For an animated family movie, this may seem a little strong. Too violent though? Nah. The action is about as violent as a Looney Tunes or Tom & Jerry cartoon, and it's a joyride to watch. The death of one character is rather gruesome, but for the squeamish, it's tolerable.\n\nI am surprised by the abundance of jokes aimed more towards adults than children. For the first half of the movie, topics like infidelity, divorce, unemployment, and lawsuits are some key points in plot development, and I don't know how many kids would be able to comprehend all that happens. Kids might be able to tune out all of that heavy material and admire the great action packed on screen. The animation is quite a spectacle. The colours in the first half of the movie, when Mr. Incredible is forced to work for some insurance company, are grey and dull, but when help is needed, brightness and contrast are everywhere! I may be able to catch this in other movies, but it was very apparent in The Incredibles. I would only recommend this to kids or adults who already like superheroes, but as I have stressed, the action of The Incredibles is fun enough on its own to merit the film as a good introduction to superheroes.",

That question could certainly start some spirited debates among the loyal fan base that's for sure. I also think there would be a great deal of support for The Incredibles. Certainly, one of the best films Pixar has ever made.\n\nNot satisfied with being a fresh new take on the superhero genre, The Incredibles is also a really well written family drama centered around Bob Parr a.k.a Mr Incredible (Craig T. Nelson.) Forced out of the superhero business, and trying to raise a family. Bob misses the glory days, and secretly performs hero work on the side. Much to the chagrin of his wife Helen (Holly Hunter), and the government handlers charged with keeping his family's powers and secret identities hidden from the public. Chasing the glory days though also causes trouble at home, and endangers his entire family.\n\nThis however, is a family of superheroes! So be warned evildoers! Mrs Parr a.k.a Elastigirl can stretch and contort herself into any shape she pleases. The Parr's youngest, Dash, runs so fast he can literally skip across water! Their daughter Violet can become invisible, and generate extremely powerful force shields. We should also mention baby Jack Jack! Whose abilities, while only briefly explored in this story, seem pretty varied, powerful and extremely dangerous to anyone who wants to harm this family!\n\nThe Incredibles is incredi... Sorry. Amazing! Superb! Fantastic! Top quality Pixar animation combined with great voice work, a super solid story, fun characters and assured direction from Brad Bird. If this isn't your absolute favorite Pixar movie, it's likely in your top 3.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you've enjoyed other Pixar films I have no doubt you'll enjoy this too. Even if you're not into the superhero thing. The Incredibles is classy entertainment for the entire family.\n\nBest Format:\n\nVisually this is superb, so a HD showing at home is a must. You'll also want to listen to Michael Giacchino's excellent score over a decent sound system.\n\nBest moment for me:\n\nI really enjoyed Dash's, er, dash, across the island. This is when he first discovers he can run across water. That giggle he lets out as he makes this discovery is priceless. Edna 'E' Mode, hero fashion designer, voiced by none other than Brad Bird himself, is also a highlight\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\n-> http://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

            "content": "I remember seeing THE INCREDIBLES for the first time in theaters, and I was only five (almost six) years old when it came out. Soon after, I became obsessed with it. I couldn't stop myself from watching it over and over again. Sure, I couldn't understand the story or all of the jokes. But I didn't care, the action and the animation looked so cool! Everyone I knew loved this movie. Whenever we wanted to talk about movies, we'd always think of THE INCREDIBLES.\n\nAs I got older, I started to understand a lot more of the jokes and found myself really getting into the story. And every time I watch it now, I could get something new out of it, and I absolutely love films that are like that. Because of that, it makes THE INCREDIBLES probably my favorite superhero film of all time and easily one of my favorite Pixar films. What I love most about this film is not the action or the animation, it's how much we can relate to the story and characters. Sure, we can't relate to the fact that they have superhuman powers. But it's the routines they go through and their personalities that we can relate to. Bob Parr is stuck working for an insurance company and his job is really leaving a bad impact on his life since his past life had affected him so much, which points out he's going through a midlife crisis. But it brings out his caring personality as he does what he can do to help people. Helen Parr (Elastigirl) does what she can do to make everyone in the family fit in, which leads to occasional arguments between her and Bob, something that any married couple can understand.\n\nTheir children, Dash and Violet, also have plenty of personality that any kid can relate to. Dash is very competitive and often gets into trouble, and Violet is introverted and easily gets irritated. But what I really love about these characters is that we get to watch them gradually become more mature and become a better person by the end. Dash learns to control himself when it comes to competition, and Violet becomes socially interactive. I relate to Violet the most, which makes her my favorite character in the film.\n\nAll of the other characters are also very enjoyable. Edna Mode is a lot of fun just for her extreme passion for designing superhero outfits. Frozone is... well, he's Samuel L. Jackson, he's always entertaining. Syndrome probably goes down as the best Pixar villain. You completely understand his motivations for disliking supers. He once was a superhero fanatic, always following Mr. Incredible around and constantly being rejected. This led him to realize he can't count on anyone, especially supers. He was also witty, intelligent, and well spoken when proving that his intentions are justified.\n\nThis was the first Pixar to focus on human characters. Beforehand, Pixar always seemed to have problems animating people, the facial expressions and movements haven't always looked right. Here, the people look fantastic, the movements are very flowing and the expressions show a lot of emotion. That has a lot to do with the awesome-looking character designs, they look a lot more like cartoons. They didn't have to worry about making them look like actual people, so they had more time to animate all the movements and expressions to make them feel more real. And the action scenes are so much fun to watch and brilliantly animated. They have all of these creative locations and setups to make them not only entertaining, but interesting. It's all the more fun when they add in Michael Giacchino's fantastic and very underrated score. It's very spy themed, kind of like what you'd here in a James Bond movie, which would fit with the film's tone.\n\nThe only small nitpick I would say about the film is maybe they could've focused a little more with the rest of the family. It's probably because I love these characters so much that I kind of wanted the entire film to be centered on them. But it's still well worth it when we finally seen them in action in the end. I'm hoping we get a lot more of them together in the upcoming sequel, which I'm SO excited for!\n\nI don't know what else to say about this film, it's just incredible! (Yeah, go ahead and cringe at that pun) I've watched it a million times before and I'll watch it a million times again, I will never get tired of it. Applause to you, Brad Bird, keep up the good work.\n\nGrade: A+",

First of all, i'm going to say by the start i was expecting something different from this movie, judging by the trailers and hype by many other people. I was expecting something greater. In what way? For me, it would have been better if the whole film was about the family already as the Incredibles instead of the origin story. Plus, is not the Incredibles until the third act...then why is the family name the whole title again? Plus, the villain; it's very praised by critics, but me personally is not so different from other super-hero villains...i would say generic, but even i think that gets way too far from what i really think. I think it's my fault for expecting way too much comedy from a film that actually wanted something serious. For what it is, it still has that cool creativity that Pixar always has and it's huge family entertaining. I didn't love it, but surely i'm glad i saw it. If you love it, then go ahead and love it, leave me with my misery.\r\n\r\nSo THIS is where Iron Man 3 got the origin of the villain!",

I must say all the voice actors match up with the characters perfectly, and I love the whole super hero world they live in and the story that goes with it.

The Incredibles is yet another phenomenal Pixar film that both children and adults can appreciate, kids will love the action packed super heroics and adults can appreciate the very mature plot. The plot yet is another phenomenally well crafted story from the fine people at Pixar, simple enough for a child to enjoy, but strung together with plenty of dark and mature nuances only adults, in most cases, will understand. The fact that the majority of the plot centers around the idea of superheroes being sued for property damage is a hysterical commentary on the ridiculous amounts of lawsuits that were going on at the time of the films release and are still going on today, but on a grander scale the story is a metaphor for getting older. The transition all people go through from being young and still believing yourself to be invincible and that anything was possible and then becoming an adult and the reality sinks in that you're no different than anyone else and will have to find your way in the world just like everybody else on this planet and the urge to feel that sense of self importance and near invincibility you had when you were young again.\n\nAs is the norm with Pixar films the voice casting is impeccable. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter deliver fantastic performances as the adult leads, Bob Parr a.k.a. Mr. Incredible and Helen Parr a.k.a. Elastigirl. Sarah Vowell and Spencer Fox do a great job as the super kids, Dash and Violet Parr. Mr. Earl J. Hickey himself, Jason Lee, does a phenomenal job as Buddy Pine, a.k.a. Incrediboy, a.k.a. the criminal mastermind, Syndrome. Major props to Mr. Lee, by the way, for creating such a complex villain and, don't get me wrong Jason Lee is one of my favorite comedic actors, but I had no idea he could pull off such a layered performance, the movie just wouldn't be the same without the rejected side kick turned vengeful super villain he created and for that he deserves some recognition. Samuel L. Jackson takes quite a departure from his usual bad mofo repertoire of characters to bring a fun, light hearted and memorable supporting superhero performance as Lucius Best a.k.a. Frozone. Even Elizabeth Pena as Mirage and, surprisingly, Brad Bird as Edna Mode deliver memorable supporting performances.\n\nThis is definitely one of my all time favorite animated films from my childhood, up there with Toy Story and Tarzan. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to call this film the Dark Knight of kids' superhero movies, both in caliber and in the fact that it is really dark at times. It's a light hearted film overall, but between the disgraced and vengeful side kick story, to the multitude of murders and deaths that occur throughout the film, they're things that would fly over most kids' heads, but looking at it now it sends shivers down my spine. Anyways, I'm rambling, I couldn't praise the Incredibles enough, from its execution to simply the amount of joy it brought to me from when I was a kid to whenever I catch it on TV nowadays. It's a spectacularly well crafted, executed and acted film that both kids and adults can enjoy that left me wanting a sequel (hint, hint, Pixar) and, for that, it's a 5 out of 5.

            "content": "\"Hey. We're superheroes. What could happen?\"\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the trailers for The Incredibles, as a kid, I didn't know what to think. I knew it was made by Pixar, the studio who wowed me since the beginning with films like Toy Story and Finding Nemo, and the idea of a superhero family sounded cool to me. But I was also not a huge fan of cartoon superheroes, cause I feel that these shows are super cheesy and dumbs down the concept of superheroes. But when I finally got to see the film, I was wowed. Not only was it my favorite Pixar film upon first viewing, but now, as a film critic on RT, I still feel like The Incredibles is the greatest Pixar film of all-time. Better than Toy Story. Better than Nemo. Better than WALL-E. Better than Up. And better than Cars.\r\n\r\nThe Incredibles revolves on the world dominated by superheroes, led by the super strong Mr. Incredible and the stretchy Elastigirl. Everything goes well until many heroes are sued for stupid reasons and the supers are forced by the government to go into hiding. 15 years later, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, now married as Bob and Helen Parr, have a family with super abilities, and while Helen loves the idea of settling down, Bob is depressed and longs to return to the glory days, even going as far as sneaking out at night with buddy Frozone doing heroic acts. Bob then gets his chance when he's called by a mysterious force to stop a mad machine gone beserk, unaware that Syndrome, a longtime fan of Mr. Incredible turned cold by rejection, unleashes a threat as part of his revenge. It's up to Bob, Helen, and his family to defeat Syndrome and save the world from his threat.\r\n\r\nAs I said earlier, The Incredibles is my favorite Pixar film. Why is it my favorite? Well, it's incredible, incredible in any form of the word and is deserving of the title. The animation is incredible. Pixar is the best studio when it comes to CG animation, and The Incredibles is no different. While the human characters look no different than a cartoon creation, it's the best look on humans in any Pixar film, much improved than Pixar's debut with Toy Story. More impressive than the human expressions are the looks of the places shown in the film. The villainous island looks beautiful, the city looks like a strong recreation of New York, and the water looks like real water. I can honestly say that Pixar's strongest animation is this film. \r\n\r\nAnother incredible thing in the film is the characters. There's Mr. Incredible, or Bob, the super strong guy. I loved the character's desire to return to hero work and the change in character throughout the film. The wife, Helen, or Elastigirl, is tough and her superpower of stretching out is brilliant. One thing I might add is how funny their characters change throughout the film. In the beginning, Bob wants to settle down and Helen wants to stay super. But when they retire, it's the exact opposite. I find that funny. Now, on with the kids. There's Violet, the teen who wants to act like a normal kid, and it's hard considering she can turn invisible and create force fields. Actually, I'd think that'd be cool to have that ability, I don't know why. I loved her personality and raw emotions in several scenes. Then there's Dash, a young boy with the ability to run at fast speeds. Dash is a cool kid, something that I would love if I had his ability. One sequence that wows me every time is when he starts running on water. Yeah, that's cool. And then there's Jack-Jack, the baby. His powers are unknown, but a twist at the end shows otherwise and it's very funny, without giving any spoilers.\r\n\r\nFrozone is a cool hero, brilliantly voiced by Samuel L. Jackson. He has the ability to freeze people. For someone like Samuel L. Jackson, that's pretty awesome. The villain, Syndrome, is pretty menacing, and his motives are pretty evil without being 100% stupid. Last character I have to mention is Edna Mode, the designer of the supersuits, voiced amazingly by director Brad Bird. She's very funny and steals every scene.\r\n\r\nAnother thing incredible about the film is the action sequences. No, this is not a G-rated film. But despite the PG-rating (a first for Pixar), the action is still pretty strong, though not super violent that would scar a kid for life. The finale is awesome, the Dash running on water in a brilliant chase scene is thrilling (and my favorite sequence in the movie), and the family in action is a cool thing. For once, we have a family film that's actually not dumbed down for young kids. Everyone can watch this and would still be wowed.\r\n\r\nLast thing to mention is the incredible score by Michael Giacchino. It's his best score ever (yeah, better than both Star Trek scores combined). The jazzy theme song is awesome, the buildup to intense scenes is amazing, and I love that the score acts like you're watching a James Bond movie, particularly the Sean Connery ones. It's awesome.\r\n\r\nIt's always debatable over which Pixar movie is the best. Some say Toy Story. Some say WALL-E. Some say Monsters Inc. Some say Finding Nemo. And some say up. But as for me, my favorite Pixar film is The Incredibles, a film filled with stunning CG animation, great character personalities (and voice roles , so strong that you don't care who voices them), Michael Giacchino's best score, and aweswome action sequences. Definitely a film that any age can watch without some sensitive soul screaming \"TOO INNAPROPRIATE!\" This is family film at its best, right here.\r\n\r\nOne thing to add real quick: WHY HAVEN'T THEY MADE A SEQUEL TO THIS ALREADY?\r\n\r\n\"THAT WAS TOTALLY WICKED!\"",

The film is so much more complex than what it seems on the surface, it is a superhero tale, that is also a sleek spy thriller, wrapped in a satire of the normalcy of suburban life. The screenplay is just masterfully written by writer/director Brad Bird, he uses the superhero element only to entice kids and to convey his main theme, which is that being super or unique in this day and age is just having the ability to be selfless. Bird portrays our society as selfish, greedy assholes who isolate themselves from the rest of the world, and are unable to conjure any altruistic sentiments. But besides the thematic elements, the dialogue is also very witty, as in all Pixar films, has very sharp comedy, and genuine drama. The animation though, may not be the best Pixar has ever put out there, but it remains loyal to its cartoony nature, and the action sequences and scenes on the island are all very stunning. The Incredibles is definitely up there with Wall-E and Up as the greatest Pixar films ever, and also, is one of the greatest animated films of all time. It has an outstanding story that will entertain children and adults, visuals that are mesmerizing, and a script that is so complex and insightful that many adults will not understand it fully.",

The only problem I really have with the Incredibles is that Pixar hasn't done a sequel to it yet. They did a sequel for Cars, which was a questionable idea in the first place, and they have another questionable idea in the form of the movie Planes coming out in sight of the next year or so. This makes me concerned for Pixar and hope that they might return to the Incredibles to give a sequel a try, because the ending was a superb set up for one for the next generation.",

            "content": "It is no secret that Pixar animation studios has churned out some of the finest animated features of the past decade, some of which are of such quality that a strong case can be made that they are comparable to the greatest of the Disney films. Following the almost ludicrous success of Finding Nemo, the studio adopted an entirely new direction for the next project and the result was The Incredibles. In my personal history of watching movies, this one has gone through unusual developments. When I watched it in theaters, I enjoyed it but did not feel that it made an indelible impression (probably because I was so fixated on the trailer for Revenge of the Sith). As the years went on I gave it repeated viewings, finding more and more to appreciate each time. Now, I regard it as the strongest film in Pixar's roster. \n\nAdmittedly, in its own line this is one of the more difficult films to grow attached to, probably because it is noticeably more intelligent than the majority of the others. While I enjoyed such outings as Finding Nemo and A Bug's Life, it is undeniable that they lack the sophistication seen in the greatest of the Pixar films. Finding Nemo, for all its visual strength and vocal talent, boasts a very standard storyline, as is the case with the latter. The Incredibles, though, is bolstered by an involving narrative and sharp script that touch upon a whole smorgasbord of social topics, giving it a satirical edge that is not present in any of its contemporaries. There is a very subtle sense of humor at work here, such as when Mr. Incredible and Frozone discuss one of the most laughably common mistakes that super-villains commit, and when Syndrome later makes that same mistake. Mid-life crisis, fear of competitiveness, the dangers of hero worship and marital strain are all part of this tale, and there are more than enough jabs taken at superhero conventions to satisfy those familiar with the material. \n\nThe strongest aspect of The Incredibles lies in its characters. Mr. Incredible, also known as Bob Parr, I find to be one of the more complex creations of the studio. From some of his more silent and anonymous acts of heroism we can tell that he has a sincere desire to help people. However, there are also strong indicators that his actions are partially driven by a pining for the \"glory days\". At once, what we get is a hero who has his fair share of faults, not the least of which is his neglect of his family, the members of which also have distinct and well-defined personalities. Speaking of which, the scenes where we see the whole family together are easily amongst the best in the film and an excellent representation of the thematic strength present, also providing many of the needed moments of humor; there is even an amusing sequence where the two parents are arguing over which route to take to get to a certain part of the city despite the fact that there is a giant robot on the loose. It is quite intriguing watching them because there is a sense of familiarity to it all; one would be hard pressed to find a kid with access to a television that did not identify with this stuff. In fact, that is another thing I believe elevates The Incredibles above the other Pixar productions. It is doubtful that many kids care for the art behind making food or the inflated effects of consumerism, but it is difficult to not care for what is going on here, and beyond that it is easy to root for the key players because the overall goal is a good one: we want to see them overcome their differences and become more united. \n\nAs is the case with all of the pertinent films, the visuals are of the finest quality. As befits the genre, there are many actions sequences contained, but they are all well executed and kinetic, with plenty of moments where we get to see the heroes use their powers in interesting ways. There are various locations to keep the film feeling dynamic, including a delightfully old-fashioned city scape, a secret island with a volcano, Syndrome's headquarters and the home of Edna Mode. Something notable is the stark difference in tone between the scenes of typical middle-class life and the sequences of heroic derring-do, a technique that was used, albeit less effectively, in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride. The former ranges from calm to drab (particularly in the workplace) while the latter are colorful and energetic. It is an effective contrast that helps us understand why Bob misses the old days so much. \n\nIf there is any weakness to be found it is probably that the climax feels a little overdrawn, which can be partially attributed to the simplistic design of Syndrome's robot. Even so, it is still a well-thought action sequence that benefits from many shots where we get a good idea of how huge the robot is compared to the heroes. This is crucial to any movie with a giant character and commonly seen in the greatest of the Godzilla movies. \nThere is a persistent misconception that animated films are ultimately only for kids. This manner of thinking has thankfully been reduced to one degree or another, but not sufficiently. In truth, when they are made with quality and intelligence, like the pertinent one and many others in its own line, I believe they have a capacity to be just as timeless as any great classic. This is because they can be appreciated on different levels as we age. Kids no doubt enjoy the more energetic sequences and colorful personalities, but as the years roll by more is found that is of value. That is the reward and appeal of a great animated film and something that such films as Chinatown, Goodfellas and Apocalypse Now, for all their greatness, cannot fully achieve.",

The kind hearted can be pushed too hard, the family relationships are similar to what a real family is, and the struggles and benefits of having superpowers are visible. At the same time only side characters show anything interesting. The Robot is simple in design yet is quite threatening, and Edna \"E\" Mode is an enjoyable nut, she even scares one of the Superheroes with a newspaper despite being 3 feet tall.\nThe action shows both stealth or high paced fighting, each showing unpredictability. The mooks are not entirely useless or retarded (a fair fight is 1 super vs 2 or armed 3 mooks), there are tense moments, the heroes are shown to be very vulnerable at times, and the main villains are merciless- doing their best to overwhelm the heroes with speed and brutality. \nThe film does however lack color. While background designs are unique and the movie is creating a comicbook/real world tone or theme, the fact remains that all the buildings, inside and out, are white and gray. There are also moments that drag on or feel unnecessary, especially when the family argues with each other.\nHowever some other environments are great. The office is shitty and small, which sucks for a big guy. E's mansion is beautiful, both in her livingroom and her lab. I love the lava wall and just how empty the secret rooms are.\nAnother great thing this film does is analyze superheroes 'realistically'. Syndrome's weapons are not normal guns, instead they are designed to paralyze and stun because Superheroes are hard to kill with most other weapons. The heroes aren't as OP as Superman or Spiderman yet still uses their abilities in very clever and smart ways. A forcefield ball with a fast guy inside turns you into a juggernaut traveling at 200mph! Also the only training equipment that someone as strong as Hulk or Thing would use would be trains.\nOverall this film knows what it is and takes itself seriously while keeping its entertainment. It mixes action, comedy and even drama together quite well and is, in this critic's mind, one of the best Pixar films (which is saying a lot).",

Not only is the basic premise lifted straight from \"Watchmen,\" but many of the attempts to undercut and point out the inherent absurdity in superhero stories-- such as the dangerous effects of capes as a darkly comic Chechov's gun-- end up clashing with the decidedly retro approach to the material. But why doesn't Edna bother to point out the stupidity of domino masks that do nothing to hide the characters identities? Even Mr. Incredible's overly harsh treatment of Buddy-- that inadvertently pushes him into a life of crime--is never acknowledged. The good guy is the good guy because he's good, and the bad guy deserves to die because he's bad. The film has this kind of selective cynicism that comes off as wildly hypocritical.\n\nPerhaps worst of all is the disturbingly gleeful manner with which people are killed (by everyone, including the two kids). It's sad that a film generally meant for children stands out so harshly within a genre whose greatest characters--Batman, Superman, Spider-Man-- are known for fighting to preserve human life at all costs. The movie is undoubtedly fun and well-made, but too morally murky for my taste.",

            "content": "\"Mister Inredible\" (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) is a man with unique gifts which he uses to help his fellow man -- even if he is late for his own wedding to \"Hellen,\" (voiced by Holly Hunter) whom the world knows as \"Elastigirl\". In fact, both were late for their own wedding because they both went after the same criminal. \r\n\r\nSoon after the wedding, the superheroes were forced by the government to live their lives in their secret identities and not help those in need after a rash of lawsuits were filed against the superheroes. However, the government created a relocation program not unlike the witness relocation program for the superheroes. Years later, the two are now living a \"normal\" life raising their three children -- two of which have their own powers. \r\n\r\n\"Bob\" now works as an insurance man, and hates it. \"Helen\" now is a stay-at-home mother who raises their children. But \"Bob\" wanted more, so he and long-time friend \"Lucius\" (Samuel L. Jackson) would go out and do heroic acts as masked men. But that wasn't enough, and he took an offer to put the superhero outfit back on, and it paid well. But he refused to tell his wife, so she became suspicious of his actions. However, it turns out that he has gotten in serious trouble, and she has to come to her husband's aid -- again. \r\n\r\nPixar seriously improved the animation in this movie. At times I thought I was watching those stop-motion animated TV specials around the Christmas season when I was a kid instead of a computer animated movie. In fact, the lead villain in the movie has a striking resemblance to the lead villain in one of the classic \"Rudolf, the Red-Nose Reindeer\" stop-action animated television special. \r\n\r\nA lot of the situations depicted in this movie is not for children. It's pretty violent in a lot of scenes and has at least one situation that is pretty adult that children wouldn't understand. I might suggest that parents should watch this movie before allowing their youngest children view this movie. \r\n\r\nThe performances of the cast members were fantastic in this movie. There was a little problem with character development on the supporting cast. One supporting cast member helped with the development of the title characters, but another one only appeared when he was needed as backup for most of the time he was on screen. Another problem is that they seemed to have bunched together the action scenes and the slower scenes that were used to develop the characters. \r\n\r\nSadly, there were too few laughs in this film. Most of the laughs were thanks to physical comedy. The few jokes worked well and will get you laughing, but you won't bust a gut. There were many missed spots that could have had a joke inserted. \r\n\r\n\"The Incredibles\" is an enjoyable movie that has a lot of fun moments, and the best animation presented by Pixar at the time. The performances by all those who provided voices is great and make the characters enjoyable. This movie would be a very good rental for a family movie night.",

From the get-go, this movie really took off for me; I immediately felt for the characters, their situation, and the problems they faced. Keeping true to Disney/Pixar fashion, there are a lot of innuendos that children won't get, but adults will laugh at, which is great because the film works on so many different levels. This is the most under appreciated film in the Pixar filmography, and it deserves much more praise than it presently has. It is one of the greatest if not the greatest movies that Pixar has ever put out, and it will stand as my favourite pixar film with Monsters Inc. tied for first as well. Excellent movie, and a 10/10 for me!",
