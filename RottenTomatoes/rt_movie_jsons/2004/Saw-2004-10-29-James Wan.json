As the two men realize they've been trapped by a sadistic serial killer nicknamed \"Jigsaw\" and must complete his perverse puzzle to live, flashbacks relate the fates of his previous victims. Meanwhile, Dr. Gordon's wife (Monica Potter) and young daughter (Makenzie Vega) are forced to watch his torture via closed-circuit video.",

Saw is such a great thrill ride with twisted contraptions that will make you squirm. It has such a simple yet great premise and intriguing villan. This movie does alot with such a small budget and is more psychological than the sequels that came after. There isn't much gore in this especially in the theatrical version.

The movie definitely has flaws such as the editing being a bit ridiculous & unintentionally funny at times, reusing some of the same clips a lot, and characters also making some pretty dumb decisions. But all of it pays off with the ending which I would still consider to be one of the best twists in any horror movie. I've seen this movie at least five times now and I swear it gets better each time I watch it, especially after seeing the sequels, which none of them ever really managed to match the quality of the first Saw movie. Despite all of its flaws, it is an awesome movie. Definitely a must-see in my opinion.",

Color me surprised when the plot actually spends more time outside of the torture chamber than within, becoming a procedural investigative thriller via flashback, more akin to Se7en than splatter horror mainstays. The traps and 'games' are just the right level, interesting while staying mostly grounded and realistic, while the storytelling is executed in a way that slowly brings the tension to a crescendo while keeping the interest in the mystery high (a necessity when Wan was working with a low budget like this). It may not be really believable, with each added twist becoming one more element that the antagonist had to have taken into account between ironing his giant cloak and sharpening his spring-loaded hidden blade, but it compensates through its core premise - making the audience think about what choices they would make in the same situations. \n\nNo idea why he was supposed to be a clown puppet, or riding a tricycle, but it is what it is.

It's a lean, minimalist, sometimes excruciating chamber piece, more a psychological thriller than a gory horror film. But make no mistake about it, there will be blood. And the title alone hints that eventually a hack saw will play into this. What makes this one the best in the bloated franchise is it's sleek, compact structure. No endless subplots fleshing out Jigsaw's grand master plan, tying characters and plot arcs from previous films in a convoluted web of understanding. It works the best because it can stand alone. Stylistically, it's a gritty and grimy film--low-lighting, claustrophobic sets (the bathroom in particular is constricting), hand-held photography. The acting is pretty decent. Tobin Bell as the iconic Jigsaw has an eerily reptilian presence. Danny Glover can play obsessive well. Cary Elwes brings something that is almost always absent from a horror movie--pathos. Leigh Whannell is the only weak link, going a bit overboard at times and clearly not an experienced actor. Director/co-writer James Wan does an efficient job of hiding the plot holes and keeping the twists and red herrings mysterious until they start piling on in the finale. But that final reveal is a doozy. It isn't very deep, and Jigsaw's pious morality is kind of muddled (do these people REALLY deserve these fates?), but for a horror film it's well above-average.",

            "content": "Finally saw all the 'Saw' films prior to seeing 'Jigsaw' (as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible this year, during a quieter and less intensive period). Heard a lot about the films, good and bad, but wanted to see them for myself to know what to expect.\n\nThe films as an overall series are a very mixed bag. The first 'Saw' is very problematic but is one of the better films of the 'Saw' series. It is very easy to see why people will dislike it, and no it is not because of the full throttle horror-like elements that are not for the faint hearted. Some of the story is ridiculous with large lapses in logic, Danny Glover's character's actions will have one screaming in frustration at the television screen. Some of the script is tight, other parts are half-baked and silly and Elwes' character's back-story had some taut tension but that it had some melodramatic parts with frustrating character behaviour.\n\nSome of the acting is not good. Cary Elwes seems to be thinking like he's acting in a very over-heated melodrama that would have been out of date even in the period when they were in fashion. Danny Glover's performance is also a mess, with a mix of over-compensating and not looking interested. Even for the film's mood, some of the editing is chaotic.\n\nHowever, for a film that didn't have a high budget 'Saw' visually doesn't look too bad on the whole, effective even. There is a real sense of unsettling claustrophobia induced in the lighting, setting and photography. Music has its eeriness.\n\nNot everybody fares badly in the acting. Michael Emerson has an unnerving presence and Monica Potter and Leigh Whannell also do a decent job. Then there is Tobin Bell, not easy to forget him after this film. James Wan does more than competently in the director's chair, even with the inexperience.\n\nDespite its ridiculousness, the story is also edge-of-your-seat and highly atmospheric. There is genuine dread, some truly imaginative traps and kills and much of it throughout is disturbing and creepy. 'Saw' is notable in particular not just for the traps/kills but also for its bold twists, the character of Jigsaw (the modus operandi, impulse and justification setting him apart from most characters of his type) and an unforgettably shocking ending.\n\nOverall, very problematic but effective. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

I thought all the twists were great and didn't come completely out of left field and the soundtrack is one of the bests in a horror movie. However, I will say that some of the dialogue sounds weird. I'm not sure if it's because of the line delivery or the way audio was recorded but it sounds like it's been dubbed over and can be very distracting at certain points. Also the small budget can sometimes break the immersion too, particularly in the car park scenes in the flashbacks. Still a really enjoyable movie and a must watch for horror fans!",

            "content": "For James Wan's feature film debut, Saw is more clever and thought-out than you might expect and shows that James Wan has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. This movie lacks clarity, explanation and context when it starts, but as you continue to watch it, everything becomes more and more clear and creative. Considering the premise of the movie, that component of ambiguity and confusion works really well and actually makes the movie a bit realistic. In other words, this is a film that forces you to watch it so you understand what's happening. This movie is kind of a mix of genres: abduction, horror and escape room all in one, making it intriguing piece of work especially for a feature film debut. Saw makes nice use of flashbacks to give us the clarity and explanation that viewers will be looking for from the moment the movie starts, and manages to give us slightly more than we bargained for by giving us a backstory that has some interesting twists and turns and a very unique antagonist. The film also has nice transitions between past and present and in the end makes it all culminate in a great way that causes the ending to have a twist that caught me off guard and makes the film end on a cliffhanger. The cinematography is also well above average for a feature debut and gives the movie a nice and impressive touch to it. All that said, the acting isn't too great and hurts the quality of some scenes and makes some moments feel a bit awkward and sloppy. The chemistry between the two main characters doesn't work out too well and they feel out of place with each other even once we get context for both of them. There are times where the acting just doesn't feel genuine or the actors feel like they're overacting or underacting. Also, even with all the explanation and backstory we get, there are still things that could've been explored and developed a lot better, especially the antagonist who we don't know that much about, and there's a lot of ambiguity as the credits roll. I left this film still curious and confused about a lot of stuff that I would've loved to understand. Overall, though, while I can understand why so many people love this movie and think it's one of James Wan's best products, Saw isn't a perfect film and has its flaws.",

It is a good movie and the concept is incredibly original and brutal, as well as interestingly philosophical. This film focuses more on the psychological aspects of the traps and is surprisingly nowhere near as gory as what's to come. The bathroom trap is escape room like and very intriguing and the reverse bear trap is an iconic horror scene that perfectly encapsulates the franchise at its best. Overall, a solid and original start to a franchise that has way worse, but also slightly better entries",

I love the concept of \"teaching life lessons\", because it is actually true and effective. I also love the concept of each \"game\". He is a saddistic killer, yes, but he is also brilliant. the torture that his victims suffer, both physically and mentally, is unbearable. But, yet again, they get chosen for a reason. The movie itself has some impressive plot twists. I think the acting was average and the special effects were quite good. Some people complain that it is too gory, but then I ask... Isn't that the whole point? I mean, we are dealing with a brutal yet brilliant killer... In my opinion, the gore was very well-distributed. It isn't extremely gory, it has it's right dose that serves it's purpose: to prove a point and to feel (somehow) the situation in which the victim is.

            "content": "\"I want to play a game\" is now one of the most iconic movie quotes in cinema history now. This first movie was so creative and different that it was able to get 8 sequels from it's premise. EIGHT! I mean that's pretty impressive and what's even more impressive is another movie based on this is on its way to cinemas as well! So that makes 10 films in this franchise all spawned from this movie. I mean that is impressive. The other eight that have been released haven't been much to write home about except maybe the first sequel. Don't get me wrong they all have their moments particularly at the end where they cleverly interlink all the films together and really blow your mind. But you have to sit through some absolute dross to get to that moment. The original though is not like anything we had seen before at the time. \n\nThe intricacy and brutality of the games set up would give us chills that first time around. They were genuinely clever and not just their for cheap gore or 3D moments. Saw 1 is still one of the most important films in the horror franchise and it always will be. So many movies tried to copy the way it was done and it ushered in a whole new era of modern horror films. It set the trend. Having a big star like Danny Glover attached did help as well but it was the psychological aspects of the film rather than the brutality of it that we lapped up. The first film set the bar for that and sadly along the way that got forgotten. So that's why some people may find this surprising to make this list. It's not for the sequels it spawned but the creativeness and originality of the first movie. \n\nThe main reason this film makes this list and will always stick in my mind is the ending though. My god is the ending to this film good. It is one you NEVER ever see coming the first time you watch and it genuinely blows your mind when it happens. Shock endings literally make some films and this ending just blows most out of the water. The surprise twist, the theme music and the iconic line of \"Game over\" just cannot be matched. If you've never seen this film then you're missing out on one of the most brilliant and creative endings in cinema history. Each sequel tries to replicate this and in some movies it's a nice surprise but not one of those twist endings hold a candle to this one. \n\nSaw the original movie will always be one of the greatest horror movies ever made. The fact Hollywood has tried over and over again to replicate it and there's still a market for people watching these films means Jigsaw and his games aren't going anywhere anytime soon. It does remain to be seen though whether any new film will live up to the lofty heights set by this psychological classic! \n\nCheck out my site LifeLowdown.com for more Film & TV news!",

It certainly matches Seven\u2019s level of gruesome imagery, but doesn\u2019t have the wisdom to leave a lot of the deaths to our imagination. Instead we get flashbacks within flashbacks so we can watch the gore firsthand with gross-out effects, which surprisingly makes it all seem less gory than anything my brain would have invented if it was allowed to fill in the gaps. They even tried to shove in a dramatic twist at the end so they could \u201cblow your mind\u201d like Seven did. The problem with this twist is that it\u2019s stupid, and does literally nothing to change what had happened up to that point. There were plenty of dumb moments in Saw, though, beyond just the final scene. This movie is riddled with errors that stick out like a sore thumb, even to someone who is barely paying attention. More than once I questioned the nonsensical actions of the characters (and therefore the crummy work done by the screenwriters.) If I were willing to go into spoilers I\u2019d dig deeper on this, but as an example: there\u2019s a character who suggests an idea early in the film that works and yet somehow completely forgets to re-use his own idea at the end. Getting all that negativity out of the way, when I take away any comparison to other films (no matter how similar) and judge Saw on its own merits, there are some redeeming qualities. I think they do a decent job of creating tense moments in the film. Surprisingly, it was what happened outside the bathroom that I found most thrilling. Danny Glover can still play a passionate police officer, and I liked his obsessive need to catch Jigsaw. While the police work in general came across as ridiculous compared to how it happens in the real world, for the sake of a movie I\u2019m good at ignoring that stuff. I appreciated some of the interaction in the bathroom between the two men. The fact that they were both trying to work together, but also harbored some animosity towards one another was a nice dynamic. It also worked well as a stumbling block to keep them from moving forward in figuring out what to do next, so it\u2019s believable that they would take a long time to make any real decisions. There\u2019s definite potential in Saw, and i was pleased to see it wasn\u2019t quite as loaded with \u201ctorture porn\u201d as I was originally led to believe. Sadly, it didn\u2019t live up to that potential, and made enough clumsy choices in the writing and directing to make it a sub-standard thriller.",

It's no cinematic masterpiece, but it's just good fun.    I'm a huge fan of horror and thrillers alike; this movie was pretty dang awesome.",

While most of the film relies more on psychological tension and terror, there's plenty of gut-churning, visceral violence, especially during the final 15 minutes. That's the time period when James Wan's otherwise compelling feature goes a little too far over the top, veering out of its David Fincher-inspired darkness into the realm of self-parody. There's lots of blood, plenty of hysteria, and perhaps one twist too many. On the strength of a grippingly original concept and 90 strong minutes of building action, Saw gets a recommendation, but only if you like this kind of thing. Saw bucks the horror trend towards formula storytelling and proves that enough qualities in the \"plus column\" can overcome a weak ending.",

The movie definitely has gross moments, but I feel it's focused on the mystery and thriller element more than anything else. The movie is well known for being pretty low budget and it's impressive how the filmmakers were able to tell an interesting story with minimal sets and actors. The movie does have some pretty cheesy dialogue at times and obviously shows some outrageous scenarios, but I will say it's entertaining. The thrilling moments are efficiently handled and the twists and turns are genuinely surprising.

            "content": "What I Saw Cut Deep\n\nAfter I watched the movie Saw, directed by James Wan, I told all my friends to stay clear of it. It really takes a certain audience to appreciate this movie. The typical horror/thriller movie normally includes demons, ghosts, and other fantasy type creature, but I was surprised to find that Saw was different from all other thrillers I've seen. It has a realistic aspect that allows you to connect on a deeper level with the characters. There is mystery, thrill, gore, and fear that penetrates the viewers throughout the whole film. But, the really kicker is that the fear, thrill, and gore haunts the audience for days after they watch Saw.\n\nCary Elwes (Lawrence) and Leigh Whannell (Adam) find themselves waking up chained to the pipes in a rundown, putrid bathroom. Neither of them knowing how or why they got there, they communicate to each other on the last things they remember. There is a way out for Elwes, however it is to kill Whannell before the clock reaches 6. Each of them eventually finds trust in each other and look for different methods to escaping. They even try to fake Whannell's death. As we watch these two characters battle their way out of death, we also are educated with the background of the mass murderer, Jigsaw, and the various works he completed in the past. Each victim he chooses has to figure out the puzzle to escape, and goes through horrific and gruesome measures to get free. Just as the rest of these murders, Lawrence and Adam drive themselves so crazy that they find themselves going through desperate measures to escape. This gruesome battle explodes in the faces of the viewers as the movie comes to an end, leaving them with a lingering sense of disgust and awe.\n\nSeeing Cary Elwes in a horror movie with Leigh Whannell was an interesting mix. Whannell has experience in the thriller movies, as we see him in movies such as Insidious, Dead Silence, and the remainder of Saw and Insidious sequels. Elwes, on the other hand, plays characters in a variety of genres: Romantic, Comedy, Action, and even the few Horror films. Most of us know him from his classic performance in The Princess Bride, where he is notoriously known for his catch phrase, \"As you wish\". Throughout the film, I found myself waiting for Lawrence (Elwes) to give into the demands of murder and simply say, \"As you wish\". It was unusual seeing Elwes play a coward and a victim rather than the hero of the film like he has played in countless films before. It was simply an intriguing twist in his typical role and overall, the roles of the characters were played successfully.\n\nWhile the actors did well in their performance, the plot of the film was difficult to wrap your head around. It became a mysterious plot line where the audience was constantly trying to figure out how to escape the chains of death, while also striving to understand the motive behind such cruel and unusual punishment. The killer had no personal ties to the main characters, but still wanted to see them suffer in some way. The murderer found interesting, yet gruesome punishments for each of the victims, that left me cringing in my seat at I watched each act unfold. Each puzzling murder made me sick because the film has so many realistic qualities that resemble real people, and real scenarios in our world that stems from mental instability. Jigsaw could be just another one of the murderers out there in the real world. This movie could be real, which brings so much more fear to the scenario than a typical horror movie.\n\nOverall, Saw had some great qualities in filmmaking. There were good actors and a mysterious plot that made your head spin. I was torn two ways watching this film. There was an interesting quality of trying to figure out the killer's mind and motive for murder. The film itself was slow going, and there weren't as many jump scares as I expected. If I were to rate this movie solely based on how it scared me throughout the movie like a typical thriller, it would get a low score. However, the aftermath of the film had a different outcome. Something about the realistic qualities in the plot and horrific thoughts and actions that the characters portray creates this lingering feeling or fear for days after the film is over. The film did a tremendous job on leaving an impression on its viewers-- whether good, bad, or simply undecided-- long after the film was over. Saw cuts deep into the viewer's minds, and leaves a lasting impression after the rolling credits that lurks in the shadows of day to day life.",

The film isn't one of the scarier horror flicks around, yet it's creepy enough to make some people uncomfortable. The premise is clever and watching the mystery unfold is gripping. One thing that didn't wow me was the cast. Cary Elwes (Lawrence Gordon) is downright over the top at points, but everyone else is serviceable, but unspectacular. The storytelling and direction are top notch, keeping you enthralled the entire time. The use of flashbacks to fill in the information gaps are well done and never detrimental to the story. I can't leave a review on this without mentioning the twist ending. It's arguably the best in horror history. I've seen the movie several times and it always gives me goosebumps. The success of Saw spawned a huge franchise, but none of the later films could even touch the high quality of this one.",

I wouldn't say that this is a straight horror movie but it is disturbing. I thought the acting in this movie was pretty good. Not the best but it was still ok. One thing I liked the most about this movie was the twist ending. It was pretty good even though it presents a huge plot hole. Saw may have some plot holes but it's still a pretty good movie. B+",

            "content": "This film has a very interesting premise. Rather than simply being a\nserial killer, the villain instead forces people to play in his game,\nwhere they can choose whether or not they'll actually survive. This\npotential to survive depends on the victim's problem solving skills and\nthe willingness to sacrifice in the face of usually great pain. These\nscenes where the sacrifice occurs often times can be morbid and cringe\nworthy, but the unfolding plot more than makes up for this. The main\ncharacters, Adam and Lawrence, are acted very well and Jigsaw's\npresence is felt very ominously and powerfully when he has speaking\nlines. Seeing the characters' backgrounds develop as the movie\nprogresses highlights the film's overall message starkly, namely how\ntoo many people don't appreciate what they have and also take life for\ngranted. Also, while they are the prettiest things to look at, the sets\nare very well dressed and definitely give off the feel of both\nabandoned buildings and the darker places of society. The producers\nalso did a very good job with creating this film and the gore in\nparticular looks quite realistic. Overall, I found the plot\nentertaining despite the gory parts, which I chose not to pay too much\nattention to.\n\nRead this and other reviews on my blog at: https://ajourneywithjake.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "When it comes to the horror genre, James Wan is the director you have to look out for. James Wan, director of stellar horror movies like \"The Conjuring\" series and \"Insidious,\" focuses more on the atmosphere than the cheap scares. As you progress through his filmography, you see Mr. Wan progress as a director. However, if you looked at Mr. Wan now you would not have realized that he began his career with the \"Saw\" series, a gory series that follows the Jigsaw killer who tests his victims on how much they would do to save their lives.\n\nThe first film in the franchise, \"Saw,\" is the least gory of them all and has the most story. The film begins with a man submerged in a bathtub who awakes to find himself trapped in an old abandoned bathroom. Adam (Leigh Whannell), after realizing his leg is chained up to a pipe, meets Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), who is in the same position on the opposite side of the room. Between them is a dead man, who has a revolver in one hand and a tape player in the other. Upon finding tapes in each of their pockets, Adam and Dr. Gordon realize they are being held hostage by the Jigsaw killer and will only be set free is one kills the other.\n\nThe film has an interesting premise at first, which later becomes idiotic. While Jigsaw is a psychopath, he does not kill his \"victims.\" Instead, he chooses people who believe their lives are not worth living and tests them to see how far they would go in order to save themselves. While the bathroom is the only torture scenario of the film, the other side of \"Saw\" follows Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover), who finds past victims of Jigsaw's violent traps and tries to piece together who the killer is.\n\n\"Saw\" also has its fair share of plot twists throughout the 103 minute run time. While some of them may seem dimwitted, the ending actually catches the viewer by surprise leaving the film in a cliffhanger for the other six films in the franchise.\n\nThe plot twists will soon become this franchise's downfall. Instead of trying to be smart, the filmmakers cheat the audience in the later films leaving the viewers with a cliffhanger that would not be answered until the following Halloween season. This is the reason why \"Saw\" is the best film out of the seven. Instead on focusing on the torture scenarios themselves (which later installments would promote with more gore and torture pron), \"Saw\" focuses on the story (even if it is idiotic) and the creepy atmosphere along with some solid scares. If anything, \"Saw\" should be watched for fans of James Wan's work. When you compare this film to his modern work, you will slowly see a transition from gore, scares, and creepy atmosphere to everything but the gore.\n\nGrade: C",

            "content": "The quality of this series seriously declined as time went on, but this first film really does stand apart as being smarter and not simply a torture porn gore-fest. Similar to \"The Cube,\" this film has a can't resist premise of two men (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) waking up in a dank disgusting basement, chained to the wall, with a dead body between them, and no idea how they got there or how to get out. This film, unlike the others, unfolds much more like a mystery, as the two men flashback to the events leading up to their imprisonment, while at the same time a team of police detectives (Danny Glover and Ken Leung) are hot on the trail of the madman who put them there. Even without the elaborate head-smashing traps and terrible choices, this would have been an exciting thriller. In some ways, the sensationalistic traps and terrible choices detract from the film, although I think it was those elements that really hooked audiences (that was the focus the the film's marketing at the time), but this entire film could have worked fine without that. However, the sequels seemed to almost exclusively focus on those extreme elements and the mystery and thriller elements took a backseat, which is why the subsequent films are nowhere as good as the first. This first film also stands out because it has a stronger cast than any of the sequels, which also includes Dina Meyer, Michael Emerson, Shawnee Smith, Monica Potter, and Tobin Bell as Jigsaw. Although this film is clearly going to be repellent for most audiences, it's undeniably compelling if you are a horror fan and can stomach the many stomach churning moments in the film. Overall, this film isn't a classic, but it is something of a cultural touchstone for when torture porn had it's short lived and ignominious run (\"Hostel\" is still the best American film of this disreputable genre).",

But for this film, it's an enjoyable crime thriller. Carey Elwes was great in this film as the doctor stuck in a dank bathroom with no escape. Danny Glover was great as the main detective trying to figure out the Jigsaw Mystery. And of course, Tobin Bell was great as the Mastermind. This film actually isn't as graphic as the others.

Directed by now legendary director James Wan and supported by a very talented cast including Carey Elwes and Danny Glover, Saw has you biting your nails and on the edge of your seat for just under 2 hours as you try to piece this mystery together. \n\nThis idea started off as a short film clocking in at only 10 minutes that was written and directed by Leigh Whannell and James Wan. Once it was picked up to be turned into a feature length film they put their talents to good use and ended up with a film made off an insanely low budget, filmed and edited in only a couple of weeks, and turned a simple and concise plot into a slowly unraveling and compelling mystery. Every minute of this film is just as intense, thrilling, horrifying, and engaging as the last and it keeps up this level of intensity right up until the final credits begin. The fact that the majority of this scene takes place within the confined space of a single bathroom gives the film a very claustrophobic effect and you feel like you are just as trapped as the characters in the film. The way the trap scenes are filmed and represented with the sped up shaking camera and loud music gets across the chaos and emotions those characters would be feeling perfectly. \n\nThe film constantly tests you by questioning what you think you know through flashbacks and proving you wrong time and time again as piece by piece the puzzle is revealed. This is where the psychological element of the film is in full effect as the film uses striking cinematography in combination with the performances to emulate fear, panic, and a real sense of urgency that eats at you the longer the film goes on. There is nothing pleasant about the story of this film or the content within as the use of blood and gore is there to further add to the discomfort you feel whilst witnessing many of the horrifying events that take place. Many people would label this film as 'torture porn' and an overly unnecessary and excessive display of blood, gore and violence. Most if not all of these people are looking at the franchise as a whole, in which they would be right. But when you consider the very gritty nature of this movie on its own and separated from the rest of the franchise it has a lot more meaning than just blood for the sake of blood. \n\nThe performances in this movie from Carey Elwes and Leigh Whannell as Lawrence and Adam, the two men who find themselves chained to a pipe, were fantastic and you really buy into these characters and believe that their actions in this situation are very logical. It's easy to point out the stupidity of characters whilst kicking back on your nice warm couch, but i'm pretty sure if you were in that scenario you would not be as calm and ready minded. The desperation in their performances all adds to the building of tension you feel with every passing second. Even the performances from the supporting characters were great despite how small some may have been. Danny Glover, Dina Meyer, Michael Emerson, and even Shawnee Smith completely sold me on their characters and did a great job at making all of the scenes outside this room just as thrilling as those inside. \n\nAs i mentioned earlier, this film managed to spawn 6 sequels unfortunately without the directing talents of James Wan. These films especially from 4 onwards go for a more blood and gore (torture porn) focus as oppose to a very intelligent Psychological Thriller focus. The presence of these films has most definitely tainted the importance of this first film and the thrilling mystery that unfolds throughout the film. But the best part is that this first film doesn't rely on the sequels in order to be understood. Do they add further story to the film? Yes, but nothing is stopping you from witnessing this masterpiece and stopping there as this film gives you enough closure to where you don't have to continue through to the last 3D instalment. \n\nSo in the end, if you are a fan of the horror genre, love Psychological Thrillers and aren't turned off by a little gore, Saw is most definitely a film that needs to be checked out. If you have managed to avoid spoilers from the film regarding the reveals that take place then that is extremely impressive as i'd say it is very impossible at this point. But if you have done so successfully then i guess there is an added layer to this film for you to thoroughly enjoy. So as my third favourite film of all time there is no doubt this film deserves the greatest score achievable.\n\n10/10",

Now that I both date a horror film aficionado and my 13-year-old son himself is one as well, I have decided to check out the contemporarily well-received original (I may decide now to see the entire series, and in order, but really who's to say?). Instantly, such trusted, bankable actors as Cary Elwes and Danny Glover give it credibility, just as Bette Davis and Joan Crawford gave such films as 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' way back in days gone by.

There were some twists at the end I also really enjoyed, but that last half squandered tons of good will I did not expect to have going in.\n\nSome minor spoilers to follow:\n\nFirst and foremost, the use of time. In the flashbacks to all the other games, there is a definite timeline where the victim has to push themselves to get out of their predicament with fatal consequences awaiting at the last second. If someone could explain to me why they were given eight hours to sit around and do nothing the entire time, please, let me know. I was okay with it until we had a flashback to the wife and daughter kidnapping which Elwes wasn't at all around for, then coming back after two hours had gone by. Two hours between finding the photograph and deciding to try looking around again and turning off the lights. \n\nSecond, the acting. Cary Elwes had two modes: growly Castiel/Karl-Urban know-it-all and family-man-Zoolander/Tyler Breeze. It was extremely distracting. Like, Hans Gruber as an American in Die Hard oddity.\n\nThird, everything that happens towards the end... just everything that happens.  Just dumb, dumb, dumb. Since Benry and Miles were major roles, making a comparison to Lost's final season and things just happening seems apt without citing specific comparisons.\n\nUgh, I was actually enjoying it for a while.

This movie has become a classic that was ruined with a swarm of sequels. This movie is beautifully directed except for all the weird jump cuts they use, but I understand that their budget was built on twine and they didn't have the money for better effects. It's just kind of annoying sometimes. Most of the movie is like How I Met Your Mother, meaning it's told majorly through flashbacks, which is fine. It's just something you might want to know going in. The movie is very fun to try and piece everything together, because the ending has like 6 or 7 twists, and they aren't as obvious as you may think. The traps, which the Saw franchise is mostly known for, are intense and gross, but there aren't very many in this one. This one is focused on story, not gore. The bathroom where most  of the film is shot looks nice but doesn't feel as claustrophobic as you may think. Anything with Gordon's family is really intense, and sometimes just messed up. The acting, except for Leigh Whannell's, is pretty good. Leigh Whannell's acting isn't very good because he isn't an actor, he's a screenwriter, but once again, they didn't have the budget for more professional actors. In the end, Saw is a great gorno with intense and disturbing moments and imagery, clever twists, great cinematography, a pretty good soundtrack, some weird editing and Whannell's acting is cringe worthy at times, but it was all due to budget constraints, not them being lazy. Saw is a movie I'll never forget and I'll definitely watch it again and again. If you have a strong stomach, want a movie with a lot of twists and turns, or just want to see what all the hype is about and can get past some uncomfortable acting, than Saw just may be the movie for you!",

I do tend to be drawn more to movies that have really realistic and intelligent dialogue and groundbreaking cinematography.  Sometimes I feel the more realistic, the better.  But I also know when I am being thoroughly entertained.  Is SAW an epic piece of writing and acting that it deserves an Oscar ? No, lets not be silly.  But for pure entertainment value of a horror movie, is it a good movie ? Yes.  Sure the 74 sequels that came out after the original SAW pretty much made the franchise a joke in the movie industry.  Each sequel got more silly and downright stupid, but to me that does not take away from the original in this horror franchise. I personally think that good horror movies are really few and far between.  Maybe 2-3 good ones come out every decade or so, if that.  These days its just gore and shock value with stupid plots and predictable twist endings that surprise no one at all and water down a somewhat loved genre by a few.  Listen, hardcore horror fans are going to be horror fans regardless of what the genre puts out.  But for the casual horror fan like myself who enjoys the old classics like Halloween, The Shining, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Exorcist, its always a treat when a horror movie that I really enjoy comes out.  I actually remember an acquaintance of mine telling me about this movie when it first came out in theatres. He wouldn't tell me what it was about, he just said I should go and see it, so I did.  A buddy and I went to check it out at the local theatre and when I say we were literally the only two people in this theatre, that was it, just us 2.  I really have never been so enthralled by a horror movie before.   It kept me guessing and had me frightened and disturbed at the same time.  Yes, it is gory and hard to stomach sometimes, but I think the overall story and concept of the original SAW was much better than the actual violence in the movie.  Of course, most people by now know the story and the twist ending.  But at the time, this twisted plotline was on par with \"The Sixth Sense\"  I found it very thrilling and innovative.  The sequels are pretty much awful and there's really no reason to watch past part 3.",

I think at it's center, the idea of Saw and this scenario has so much potential, but how it was executed (sorry for the pun) delivers to just barely satisfy and not exceed expectation.

As the two slowly figure out the game they're apart of, a detective obsessed with finding out who the person responsible is attempts to close in on his suspected killer.\n\nUntil yesterday, I had never seen the original Saw film in it's entirety. Sure, I had seen some of the traps and I had actually seen a lot of the movie through clips and such. But, this was the first time I had sat down and watched the film. How does it hold up, especially nearly eleven years after it's release? Well, let's see.\n\nThe acting is really great. Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell both do great jobs at portraying people from completely different backgrounds but who are both left, stuck in a situation they can relate to. Tobin Bell, even in his very limited role in this film, is still bone-chilling as the diabolical Jigsaw (or, his real name, John Kramer), and delivers a performance that many should remember for years to come. Danny Glover is fantastic as Detective Tapp, a figure with a dark past, who is obsesssed with finding out Jigsaw's identity. Monica Potter also does a great job as Elwes's wife. I won't explain her role in the story because I suppose it's a spoiler, but she does great in the role.\n\nThe music, from Charlie Clouser, is just brilliant. It has that sort of dark, rough edge to it that you would expect in a film like this. The unofficial theme song to the film, entitled \"Hello Zepp,\" is probably one of the best themes to a horror movie, ever, especially when you think about the climatic ending that accompanies the song. In my opinion, the music to the film really elevated it above a standard horror movie.\n\nI really enjoyed the script and the story. It really deserved it's R rating, with all the \"fucks,\" \"shits,\" and such in the film. The story was pretty tight, even if there were a few small plot holes that I noticed, but it's probably because I'm such a good person at noticing things like that. The script was great, giving us dialogue you would reasonably expect in a time like this.\n\nThe cinematography and direction was spot on. James Wan, or perhaps the editor, liked to use a lot of shots that lingered or would like pan over to a spot and fade into another scene or location. That gimmick worked very well in some scenes (one I can remember the best is when the camera pans down and into the bathroom from the ceiling).\n\nThe only thing I really didn't like about the film was a bit of the gore. I'm okay with gore and blood in films, but the film took it to extremes a bit. Perhaps that's why people didn't like the film, because there's so much of it in there. Now that I think about it, it doesn't really bother me, but still.\n\nOverall, Saw is a fantastic horror film. The acting, music, script, story and cinematography are all completely on point. While I do have a few issues with some elements of the story and a bit of the shots with gore, Saw is a film that any horror buff needs to check out.\n\nGrade: A-",

There is a moment where a killer ties a little girl up and slowly points a gun to her. She's crying and screaming for her mom. The scene is never-ending.\n\nI mean, just.......I don't know. Saw is too brutal a movie for me to recommend and the plot gets too far-fetched near the end. Also, Cary Elwes is pretty horrendous here.",

            "content": "For his debut, full length, mainstream film, James Wan's 'Saw' film is quite the film; and who knew it would explode the way it did, it's iconic in many ways and is excellently written. Right from the first shot this film is intriguing and interesting; it has an excellent, thick atmosphere, where we feel like the characters do by the end of it, smart cinematography to reflect the character's moods as well as the signature green colour, excellent editing, great makeup on our characters to show the progression of time, and a very good soundtrack. It was an excellent and nice touch at the end when it looks like the theme music is coming out of the player and it was used subtlety at the end like in the short, I kept waiting the whole film to hear it and there it finally was, used to its full effect! And the iconic puppet was made entirely from scratch! But the quality on those videos gets progressively worse over time. \n\nI'm honestly quite surprised at how well the story is written, I knew of Jigsaw and why and what he did before I saw the film, but I'm surprised at how well thought out it is and I really like his character quite a lot. A lot is told through backstory and it is very interesting and well written, it didn't feel like needless exposition at all. Some might say it is needlessly complex but I appreciate it. I'm also surprised at the lack of gore, it is certainly in there but its use isn't over the top and it is good to see that the whole series remains like this. The script is also good as it is written in a way for what you would be thinking in that exact same scene, it also reveals many things that might seem quite odd at first, like when Adam throws the bag into the bath, although it isn't like Lawrence would have seen the bag, but most likely to take his mind off of it. It also has many moments where you figure out what a character is thinking the moment they think of it and has you react the same way they do. Who knew something so iconic such as the reverse bear-trap came from something that was under 10 minutes long, its genius. The only part that seemed a little off was the fact that the cop walked into the wire, you'd have thought a cop would have seen it. Honestly, unless I'm missing something, I'm not sure why that person was punished, sure, he was chasing the other person and that might have just been a trap to stop someone following him but that death in particular seems to go against his code, while the other one fits, as is revealed later in the plot. True, if you do look closely at everything that happened, you can find faults with it, but given the world it has set up, it isn't anything distracting and I only thought about it after the film had finished. Besides that, everyone else has already mentioned them, although, good job nobody shot the gun or else the whole series could have been finished right there and then.\n\nHowever, I would not go into that razor wire crime scene, or any of those crime scenes, no matter my job, you would have also thought that the person in that trap would try to be a little bit more careful. And Amanda should have looked for the key quicker instead of messing around trying to get rid of the lock because that wasn't going to happen. I noticed her arms right away but the way the camera zooms down to show us her arms and the table was great, but I am not sure if the detective would ask if that was the reason why she was chosen, it seems unlikely. I did wonder if, in the final scene, if he still had the key, if he would have been allowed to actually leave, and even if he did, Adam would more than likely try to attack that person in there. I didn't understand how he was breathing in the water though, maybe that is why he woke up so abruptly, however, as we see in a later film, he wasn't put directly into the water but he slid down over time. You might question why he was even in water but as we see later on, the person who did it was crazy, or they felt like it was a mistake they had to address, as that part in particular received ciriticism. But it made me laugh that they were still talking given the fact that he got shot at the end; also the fact that Adam wasn't more afraid of Lawrence seeing as how he was tasked with doing something to him, not saying as not to spoil it. But given the fact that Lawrence wasn't in the water and Adam was might answer that question. He should have pretended to die in a much less awkward pose as it would be hard to keep your leg up in the air all that time. They could have used the toilet lid to get the phone at the end, although, it was used in an awesome way, but he didn't even get the phone that he did something to himself to get but the phone did seem to disappear at the end.\n\nThe cast was well chosen and they all played their roles perfectly, I felt bad for David Tapp quite a bit though, he was always getting shot or cut or something. Actually, I think one of the ways he got cut was an inspiration for 'Assassin's Creed', especially with what the other person was wearing. I can't say I predicted the ending, but I know who plays Jigsaw but the other person that is used in the film did end in a nice twist and he certainly was odd as well. I also think he was reminded of the 6pm time limit, as it looked like he had forgotten, but I doubt it. Tobin Bell was certainly an excellent choice and he sticks true to form by picking well written characters, I like that he isn't just a crazy guy and, like the rest of the film, is very well written and we learn more about him in the sequels. I think it gives it a certain mystique that he was only in the film for a very small amount of time, though. The way we are introduced to Lawrence was odd, given his reaction to it all, it gave the impression that he had been there longer and it seemed odd how he didn't talk sooner.  As well as the fact that he had been left alone and not made wet, sure there wasn't a bath by him but why all the hate on Adam? But we see a character do something smart with their foot that Lawrence should have done, but he wasn't exactly thinking straight at that point.\n\nThe final scene of this film coupled with the final shot of this film is just awesome; you could not get rid of my smile if you tried. Everything set up in that final scene was absolute perfection. For such a short film, the filmmakers set up such a vivid and realized world but there really did not need to be any sequels to this as it would have been an inventive story wrapped up nicely in one film, with a sinister end where it fades to black and all we hear are screams. But that of course was never going to happen because this was made for a small amount and it absolutely blew up. What else I like about ending is that leaves it open to a possible sequel but could work just as it is; the sequels feel like they were planned out all along, though. They all feel like they were connected when the filmmakers were writing the second film as the story starts to get bigger when that film happens but when this was made, they only had plans for this one film, which makes sense. I think it could work as TV show as well, because that is what later sequels feel like, not because they're bad but because of the whole detective scrutiny, overall feel because of how much we learn about Jigsaw and just the fact that the story has so much going on, they wouldn't be able to get away with the gore but that's another thing. Wan says  he didn't intend for this series to go the route it did, but honestly I don't think the series went as over the top as it could have had in the hands of less talented people but it made me laugh that it was produced by 'Twisted Pictures' because of course. \n\nA sequel was greenlit soon after this had premiered and it isn't exactly hard to see why, it is still hard to believe it came out in 2004, given how popular this film is, dare I say legacy, you would have thought it would have come out long before it did. I would have thought that at least this first film would have gotten better reviews than it did as I think they are being too negative with their consensus for no good reason and this film isn't anything like 'Se7en' because this film is actually good. I know this film had its 10 year anniversary in 2014 as was re-released but Rotten Tomatoes really need to fix this error with a lot of films; it came out in 2004, not 2014, as it says it did as of this review. Whannell and Wan are excellent writers who have done excellent work and this is a fantastic example of it; it is a lot different than one might expect, from what they have heard. But please watch this series from the start; don't think you can just watch a random sequel because it is on TV one night and that it won't matter just because it is a horror sequel, trust me, it will matter.",

The movie is full of twists and turns, and the ending blew my mind the first time I watched it! Already knowing what's going to happen, may ruin the movie a bit, but it's still a ride nevertheless. The soundtrack is great. It fully captures the claustrophobic and the creepy setting. The first movie is the one with the least gore and blood, but it's still very unsettling and disturbing at times.

The cinematography is bad, skipping around, and in the situation the guys are in, I don't think they would be telling stories about how try got there and trying to figure that part out, when they only have so much time until they die. We have a total of four sets we ever really see, which are just dark dirty rooms, which combined with the skill of the actors shows that the budget isn't the highest.  We don't see all the gore that we see in the coming sequels here thank god, it's mostly off screen as well.  The ending is the best part, the chase was bad however, but just the last scene with the music, Jigsaw getting off the ground showing he was there all along, and shutting the door while the guy screams is great.  At the same time he says \"Game over\" which is the second of his two famous and creepy quotes, the other being \"Hello Amanda.  I want to play a game.\"  Overall it wouldn't be so bad if the acting and script weren't so bad, but we learn a lot about our killer, and he is developed very well, the other guys not so much.

To start off there's way to much unnecessary gore in this movie. The bloodied guy in the middle of the room really didn't need to be there, he played a factor in the final act but he didn't need to be there. How that one woman had to slice open that guy to get the key to her death device was really stupid and disturbing. This film could've been just as effective without all the gore it had. Everything could've just been offscreen and seen the terror on their faces. The positives in this horror film is that the acting was pretty good with the exception of two people. The one African American dude and Zep. When they were fighting it was some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The other standout in this film is that the setups are clever but really just an excuse for gore. The machines again could've been offscreen and still make for a really intense scene. The whole plot line was all over the place in terms of the character backgrounds and the backstory on Jigsaw. Saw had cool moments for sure but ultimately this whole movie was just an excuse for gore to show off. D+",

            "content": "There is a process, a very important and not to be underestimated process in which any film must be made, the story must be to some degree engaging, have characters that we can either get behind or force us to test our morals and find solace in an antagonist, the script must be of some standard and you actors have to be cast appropriately for the roles. This is a humble rule of film, if you have these fundimentals, essentially your film, to some degree will not falter. Now when it comes to making a horror movie, these ideas are essential in order to create a word that truly engages us so much we are scared and immersed completely in the world, sadly very few people understand this, not only movie makers but movie goers and the results usually come out like Saw! You guys all remember Saw right? You know that franchise that was notorious for defining the genre \"Torture Porn\", milked its franchise with countless installments and oddly enough got a massive commercial following. See what Saw done, was essentially steer film goers in a new direction, instead of being forced to be scared, the creators of this film decided that in order to make you squirm was to just show you brutal and horrifying acts of violence in order to make you feel scared. The problem is that violence, when over used, becomes something of a desensitisation after prolonged exposure. Meaning that any act of violence can be over looked and ultimately yawned upon as the audience feel no shock by its inclusion after a while. Thus leading to movie goers darting to a cinema every halloween to ultimately see what atrocious violence they could witness and for it to be called a horror movie, without really giving 2 shits about the actual content of the film. Now as i mentioned earlier, there is a process or set of rules that must be followed in order to ensure your films success, to varying degrees, Saw succeeds in only on of those mentioned rules, The story is, to of a certain standard, engaging. To sum it up, 2 \"Random men\", Adam and Doctor Lawrence wake up in a disused toilet, chained by their feet to piping, they have no idea why or what is going on, to make matters worse, there happens to be a dead man in the middle of the room and we soon find ourselves engaged in a game of deception between the 2 in order to survive. Here that sounds not bad, your right, it does sound not bad, lets continue, on further inspection it actually turns out that there is a serial killer who wishes to test peoples faith in life, who has named himself Jigsaw, who appears to have put him there and is also responsible for a whole host of other sadistic games in where the victims must follow out torturous proceedures in order to survive, luckily for someone a crack team police duo are on the prowl and are getting closer to Jigsaw, or are they? Dun Dun Duuuuuun! so plenty to work with, some of it not exactly needed but hey better to have lots to work with and whittle it down rather than have to little and be forced to beef it up by eh filler. So how does Saw manage to tear its own foot off? Well firstly, there is a large list here so please prepare yourself, the script is a fucking abomination. I literally am not kidding. Ever watched a film where people just saw either the most obvious of things in order to move the plot along or where peoples motivations are just commentary as they do them? Well Saw isnt subtle about anything ladies and gentlemen, Saw literally walks you through every single, minute detail in dialogue just in case your poor brain cant rely on its own power or your ability to look at a visual and get what is happening. Which is kind of bizarre because James Wan is directing this and his visuals are actually pretty straight on the mark. So you will have characters either voicing everything they are doing or voicing exactly what you are saying as you watch the film. If they had cut even half the dialogue out of this film it would be dramatically better. Next thing, the film cuts like the editor had just discovered the cut tool for the first time, decided to get wired on coffee and just snap everything to shit. The film cuts so much your eyes are fuckin assaulted by monotonous actions in order to make them feel desperate, when probably just showing us the desperation of the monotony through the actors face would have worked... Oh wait, thats right, you went and completely miscast your movie! Shit, thats why the editor is trying to spice things up. Cary Elwes, who i think is outstanding, is horrifically miscast as the \"good\" Doctor, who when he is one note is bearable but when it comes down to the distress is just not able to cut it, without you pissing yourself with laughter. His latter scenes are so cringe worthy as he jumps between desperate man and 5 year old, you have zero sympathy for the guy, you couldnt care less if his family die and thats a bad thing, i should care, i really should but i dont, I dont care if he makes it out, I dont care if his fellow prisoner Adam lives as he is even more annoying and cry babyish. Neither of our protagonists we are drawn to like or believe, or even relate with. Leaving us with Danny Glover as the detective, who should be sacked because the his character is written as such a guff cop that i have no idea how he got a job in the first place. Tobin Bell gives the best performance of the entire piece and when you see the film, you'll know that doesnt mean much what so ever. There are zero scares, Zero! Nothing is frightening at all, the must yuck inducing moment is when Adam stuffs his hand down a toilet full of shit, something we would most likely rather be doing that watching this movie. The film also has god awful pacing issues, you cannot connect with any one story going on as its all mixed so shockingly together that by the time you have started to invest in one story it cuts away and takes you back to another and leaving you on it for ages. This film would actually be decent if it cut a lot of needless plot and sequel baiting out, hired the right actors for the job and got a script that was more visual that dialogue heavy. Silence would have been golden in this film. What can i give the film credit for? It has some inventive torturous devices, the sets all look really good, the camera work at times is of a certain standard and the music is pretty creepy, if only really used sparingly. But thats it, everything else is just off. In a film where so much could have went right, it just sets up a money making machine for idiots. No excuse me as I go and torture myself while watching the rest of the franchise.",

            "content": "Originally conceived as a nine and a half minute short film, the low budget, quasi-exploitation feature Saw is currently being celebrated with a 10th Anniversary theatrical re-release in theatres, and is one of the key sources of cinematic influence within the culture of the contemporary horror film genre from the past decade. Alongside such notable disseminators of high-decibel terror as Darren Lynn Bousman, Eli Roth, and Tom Six, Australian director James Wan is one of the most successful, commercial filmmakers among a band of compatriots intent on taking the horror film to its most extreme and depraved depths. Through the substitution of psychological terror for cheap, bloody thrills, memorable in terms of sheer sensory explicitness, and frightening in their unrelenting use of vulgar brutality, Wan and Company have made a name for themselves by placating an audience that seems to revel in distressingly shocking and unsettling cinematic imagery. And yet, despite the viscerally compelling nature of these films, collectively they are more often than not macabre to the point of banality, paying homage to all of the various horror genre tropes and tableaux to the point of cinematic regression and stagnancy, unaware and tactless in their hyper-aesthetic send up to the form. Possibly one of the most cited and well known aspects of the original Saw film is its central antagonist's predilection for elaborate torture, dismemberment, and death, played out as a series of puzzles in which his victims are forced to capitulate and play, else die in a brutal blood bath, each demise more sick and twisted than the last. In the original film, one of the victims is found impaled amid a nest of barbed wires, another narrowly escapes having her jaw ripped open by a bear trap, and the film's central protagonist is forced to desperately search for a saw with which to perform self-amputation, sans anesthesia and tourniquet.\n\nThe lurid nature of the Jigsaw Killer's homicidal actions in the original Saw gave rise and license to a slew of sequels predicated on delivering more of the same, each subsequent installment in the franchise bloated with grisly extremist violence. In response, the larger commercialization of the contemporary horror genre has become more explicit in its depictions of violence than ever before, showing the sort of on screen gore that classic horror staples from decades past only ever implied, or used sparingly if graphically depicted at all. Where John Carpenter's 1978 slasher-genre, original Halloween rarely depicts outright murder, with Michael Myers seen largely in shadow, amid intricately composed shots and meticulously edited sequences, the kind of gore and carnage that plagues the Rob Zombie directed re-make is comparatively excessive, marking Carpenter's film as a classic and Zombie's a disposable cheap trick, the first truly scary and the second merely nauseating. The larger proliferation of Zombie-level macabre, graphic violence has its roots in James Wan's directorial debut, which has a decided preoccupation with the exploitative nature of its setting, giving way to the audience's attraction towards the film's psychopathic murderer, the perverted orchestrator of shock, awe, and gore. Jigsaw is the main draw of much of the Saw franchise's continuing appeal and cultural relevance, and one of the main reasons why horror has become so synonymous with extended sequences of bondage and torture, bordering on the pornographic nature of the snuff film, and paving the way for a contemporary fetish for voyeuristic violence, divorcing the horror genre from terror, and marrying it to sadism.\n\nAnd yet, on closer inspection, Saw isn't about sadism at all. At its very core, from a structural stand point, Wan's film is about two people trapped in a room together, forced to come to terms with life itself and how they see themselves in relation to the larger world, bringing up questions on the meaning of exsistence and morality. Yes, the film's central protagonists are engaged in a sadistic exercise in contemporary horror genre violence and sadism that is potentially damaging to the reputation of the horror film, but a larger existentialist dialogue is submerged beneath the surface level gore. While Wan's style as an auteur is decidedly over laden with senselessly nihilistic overtones, his intentions are good, and when the film focuses on its characters' internal extrapolations it truly shines, reaching towards larger dramatic ambition and intellectually nuanced scares. While the film never truly finds its rhythm, oscillating between scenes of dramatic tension between its two central protagonists, and sequences of luridly revolting, shock-based theatrics, Saw is singular in its approach towards its subjects, offering an avenue into its bondage-based scares that is tasteful, coming off as being both respectful of and primarily interested in its victims, even if they don't always get away in the end.\n\nAnd yet, for all of Wan's understated cleverness and underlying dramatic ingenuity, Saw is still remembered for the moral perversions of the Jigsaw Killer, and the creative ways in which he chooses to kill his victims. While Wan never directed or wrote any of the subsequent films in the franchise, his mark on the contemporary horror genre as a whole can be traced to this particular series of films, ushering in an era of nihilism and detachment within the horror genre that still permeates the popular culture. American director Darren Lynn Bousman, who took over the Saw franchise starting with the second installment, took up creative reins to a series that has since become centered around a brand of cinematic violence that is depraved, debauched, and immoral in the treatment of its victims, the villain turned into the main attraction and perversely sympathetic hero. In addition to Bousman, directors such as Eli Roth and Tom Six have ensconced themselves within a horror genre culture of recreational homicide, producing such blockbusters as Hostel, wherein American tourists are tortured to death at a grisly European locale, and The Human Centipede, a sick and twisted Frankenstein tale, both proof of an ever growing taste for desensitizing violence and an intellectually dulled horror palate. While this strain of barbarism as spectacle is nothing new in terms of the history of the horror film, with the most notable example from the past being Tobe Hooper's 1974 splatterfest The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it's important to note that Hooper's backwoods nightmare never feels exploitative thanks to its minimal set design, unsettling musical score, and effectively misleading editing, its outright depictions of violence implied, the viewer prodded into projecting the levels of sadisitic depravity that Bousman, Roth, and Six shoot outright, confining their films to the realm of documentary, overly fascinated with violence itself, as opposed to what that violence might mean or incite in the viewer, initially revolting but not consistently terrifying.\n\nWhile the contemporary horror genre may be more unsettling than ever before, the original Saw film itself is not the source of this preoccupation with depravity. Rather, it is its poorly conceived atmosphere and perversely compelling violence that has helped to propagate sadism in the modern horror film, convincing many directors that their audiences truly crave sick and twisted horror movie villains and monsters, visceral debauchery the social currency of cultural relevancy and cinematic ingenuity. It's ironic then that much of what makes James Wan's debut feature film so interesting is its focus on the victims, the film less of an exploitation or bondage feature than an existentialist play, a poor man's No Exit, hell found within the souls of Jigsaw's victims, rather than within Jigsaw himself. Fortunately, Wan has found some less problematic success with his more recent cinematic fare, both in 2010's haunted house romp Insidious and 2013's surprisingly effective demonic possession feature The Conjuring, turning away from the obvious scares of the Saw franchise in order to explore some of the classic horror tropes and conceits that make his more recent outings so memorable and, may it be said, terrifying. And yet, James Wan is no modern master of horror, as of yet lacking the ability to tell a scary story that doesn't rely entirely on what has come before, his films owing a lot to the form and the genre without elevating either to art. Nevertheless, he is possibly the greatest horror director of his generation, and Saw is a cultural landmark, and one of the most important horror films of the past ten years, even if its legacy is indebted to sadism, an unfortunate side effect that continues to bleed into the modern horror film to this day.",

You can get away with gaps in logic in certain genres when the audience is able to suspend disbelief, but when you're dealing with puzzles, the audience is engaged in trying to solve them, which reveals those leaps in logic all too easily. This is the biggest reason that Saw fails. It's not because, as some argue, it features too much violence and gore. There certainly is A LOT of violence and gore on display here, but unlike the glut of Saws to follow, the original isn't JUST gore for gore's sake. There is a story here; the premise is intriguing enough, and, if you can stomach it, there is actual entertainment to be found amid the grisly violence. The problem is that the way said story is told is downright stupid. And that's the last thing you want your psychological thriller to be.",

This movie is eerie, tense, and scary. The acting, aside from Tobin Bell, is pretty terrible. That being said, that never seemed to bother me, as the directing, writing, and cinematography overpowered the acting. There are scenes of this movie that actually creep me out to this day, namely the Reverse Bear Trap scene. What I love about this movie is that all the \"torture\" is offscreen, so that adds to the scariness (something the sequels forgot about). The ending is one of my favorite movie endings of all time. The movie is problematic and has terrible acting, but the writing, directing, cinematography, scary tone, cleverness, and fantastic ending overpower those flaws. 8.5/10",

People hate this movie because of that very reason and I get it, its not for everyone, but I like my horror with tons of blood and guts and seeing this on the big screen had me smiling for a month.  Plus, the first one was nothing compared to what the other 6 SAW movies brought to the table as far as gore went.\n#3 - No stupid dumb ass teenagers, every single victim on this film are adults, doctors, detectives, cops, this doesn't take place in * name your generic boring high school *\n#4 - The method the SAW movies take out their victims to this day is probably my favorite thing horror related, the traps and devices used are varied and some are flat out inventive and unique, and some of them I have wished on people I absolute detest.\n#5 - It introduced Jigsaw, my new favorite horror icon, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface, Pinhead, Freddy Kruger all made perfect sense and fit the template of horror for their time \" there is a reason why their reboots have all flopped\" , Jigsaw was perfect for 2004 as he was not a serial killer himself but instead placed the victims in situations where he would give them a chance to survive if they played the game, that to me was amazing and it more than warranted a place for him next to those great horror icons.\n\nI am one of those weird people who actually agree with Jigsaw and I consider him the hero of the movie, so many people ungrateful to be alive, how about making them be grateful by putting them in a situation where their moral compass and self survival instincts kick in...brilliant....wethere it works or not that's a whole other conversation lol.\n\nThe movie is set to make you think you know who Jigsaw is and by the time you think its over....the big reveal happens and it is to this day one of my favorite moments watching a horror movie.\n\nI got the SAW blu-ray boxet for under 20 bucks...all 7 movies on slightly better quality than dvd so I am doing a Sawathon for my 31 for 31 so the next 6 updates will be SAW related and I understand if I lose the rest of the friends I have on this thing because of that lmao.\n\nFINAL WORDS FOR SAW\nBest Trap: Reverse Bear Trap - its Iconic.\nBest Death: Detective Stephen getting blasted by multiple shotguns\nMoment the movie made me go WTF am I watching ?:  Cary Elwes acting towards the end of the movie......its a total derrailment of epic proportions.",

The acting is mostly great, Cary Elwes is having a hard time going with either an American accent, or British accent, and it's distracting and a bit funny in an unintentional way. The writing is great, and it's nice to hear the jigsaw killer talk that way even though I felt like there should've been more of it. There is another problem which is when the time doesn't go the way that it was. But for what it is, Saw is original despite they took some from Seven. It has some nice edits in this which is something I barely see in a film like this, and it has done well with it and does't use too much of it. It's twisted in a good way, it's got a sweet soundtrack, and it's not trying to be a torture porn film like the sequels are trying to be. I would've been shocked at the twist ending, which it is a great twist, if I wasn't spoiled by it. Who knew Saw would turn into a series with seven movies?",

Seriously, I mean there's always someone bleeding profusely at some point of this film! Yet another reason fans of the genre will be enamored with Saw.\n\n Besides surpassing the average genre fare, Saw is intelligent. Unlike the usual slasher or gory pic, Saw's story is, for the most part, logically sound, although I put \"logically\" very lightly. Obviously, it's not every day you wake up in a dirty abandoned bathroom chained to a pipe! For what the film was, it made relative sense. At least, it made more sense than most of the other horror flicks I've seen. The story was engaging, and very compelling. There were a few gaps in logic and minor plot holes, but that's pretty standard for any horror movie. The real logical person in that situation would either find a way out in the first 5 minutes or give up and find a way to kill themselves. But a 5 minute movie where the main character dies in the first 5 minutes wouldn't sell at the box office, would it? So the filmmakers have to suspend logic in some places to move the story along, something most critics don't understand. That doesn't make the movie bad, because believe me, if the mentioned critic saw the \"5-minute Saw\" I talked about before, he/she wouldn't complain about the real film at all.\n\n Moreover, Saw actually had pretty decent acting. The characters were well-rounded, and this movie was a good kick-starter for the career of Leigh Whannell. Cary Elwes, who I've seen in Twister, Princess Bride, and Robin Hood: Men In Tights, turned his usual goofy character into a serious, dramatic role as Doctor Lawrence Gordon. Desperateness loomed in his eyes the whole film, as he had no idea what was to happen to his wife and child being held captive by an unknown man he thinks is \"The Jigsaw Killer\". Danny Glover, who almost always dies in a movie, (It seems he's almost surpassed Leonardo DiCaprio in movie deaths!) takes on a detective role as Detective Tapp, obsessed with finding the Jigsaw Killer after Jigsaw kills Tapp's partner, played by Ken Leung.\n\n This film was a good watch, especially if you like horror films, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth. But that was the point!",

In this psychologically exhausting and exhilarating terror exercise, we follow two men who wake up chained in a disgusting bathroom as the new victims of the serial killer Jigsaw, who specialises in mental and sadistic torture. Claustrophobia is the key to the success of this film. Screenwriters Whannell and Wan are truly creative with their one setting of the filthy bathroom where most of the action takes place. Futhermore, the intensity is enhanced by the pace that only suffers from the occasional use of flashback that spoils the rhythm a little bit. Still, there is no denying that Saw briefly pumped a little life into a genre full of clich\u00e9 and structured storylines and it was the beginning of dark new horror saga.",

It's a distracting approach, but thankfully it's used sparsely. Other than that, 'Saw' is actually quite an effective horror film that delivers some well-executed thrills.

The plot is deliberately thin and a majority of the movie is based around the two characters that are locked together and it is through their recent activities that you learn about the people around them.  The characters are incredibly well visualised and special mentions have to go to Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell, as they work so well together in the lead roles.  The story movies along incredibly well, and you can really feel the desperation growing in all the characters as things progress, right up to the climax that left a lot of the movie's audiences reeling in their seats.  The gore is actually quite minimal, but when it does happen it is handled excellently, and the way the movie is shot the bloodred hues really stand out against the washed-out backgrounds.  The production values are very high especially when you take into consideration that it had a relatively low budget, and the fusion of fast editing, visual style, and music score all seem to go naturally hand in hand.  This is one of those movies where you look back and actually think you have seen more than is actually shown on screen, and it proves that even the simplest story, when handled correctly can pack a huge punch.  Saw is a true classic of modern horror and it went on not only to spawn 6 sequels, but to also become the inspiration for a lot other movies that followed it.",

Consider for instance Richard Roeper calling it \"a glorified snuff film.\" Surely we didn't watch the same movie. Saw is fairly ridiculous, to be sure, but its makers are not out to write literature. Is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre not sadistic? Or any horror movie for that matter that features a psychotic killer? Or Goodfellas, a great film that is positively dripping with nihilism and evil, a movie that made me feel icky after watching it. As for blood, there is more of the red stuff in Scream, and there are few deaths here. American audiences love a good villain, which is what the Jigsaw killer is; how is he much different than Hannibal Lecter in the Silence of the Lambs, a critical favorite? Surely there is no grand statement in Jonathan Demme's movie; it's just an intense thrill ride made with great style and is well made. Saw is not well made or made with great style. Still it was a fun movie, and I liked the twists. Some critics have said the twists were an insult to one's intelligence... how? They were corny in a fun way. This is a popcorn movie, not the Republic of Plato. I didn't see the twists coming. Perhaps I'm a moron? But the message is clear: if you enjoyed Saw in any way, you ARE an idiot, equivalent to one of Shakespeare's groundlings. But again, horror wouldn't be the special thing it is without the constant moralizing of critics.",

There has always been a mixed hype towards the franchise but this one film is the single reason I love the Horror genre to the extent I do and why I am such a movie buff. Now \"Saw\" is NOT a perfect film in any sense. No movie is perfect (It just doesn't exist). Despite those who push \"Saw\" to the side simply because they can't handle the grisly material, I don't believe dissing a film's violent content is viable ammo given it is rated \"R\" for STRONG grisly violence. Aside from the hate this movie has garnered through the years, let me start with what I love so much about this film. \"Saw\" MADE horror for our generation. Some argue that \"Paranormal Activity\" solidified the genre for our time, but \"Saw\" came first and is much more complex. Using extremely clever camera work and script writing talent, James Wan is my favorite Director whom also made other Horror gems such as \"The Conjuring\" and \"Insidious\". I will admit that the sequels didn't have the same power that the original did, but what sequels really match up to there proceeders or even exceed them? It's almost unrealistic. The story surrounding \"Saw\" is so sophisticated and is clearly well-worked out to a point that watching all of the films in sequential order is similar to connecting the pieces of a puzzle where it all makes sense in the end. Is \"Saw\" scary? I wouldn't say it's \"scary\" in the sense most people think but the idea and concept is oddly realistic. The grisly violence is not necessarily made only for shock value but has a great depth in symbolism that some viewers just don't catch on. The cherry on top is without a doubt the amazing twist ending. I won't give it away for those who haven't seen it but \"Saw\" is much bigger, better, and more intelligent then so many people give it credit for. \"Saw\" IS our generation of Horror and will always be the reason I love movies so much.",

            "content": "If there's one film that despite my best efforts people refuse to see it's Saw. Saw is wildly thought of as being at least a bloody movie, if not a 90 minute gore-fest. And with fair reason, after its release Saw was accused of being sadistic and is many times cited as the start of the \"torture porn\" trend of 2000s. Well this is partially true. While Saw was responsible for opening the door to films like Hostel, it is very much not sadistic or \"torture porn\". People and studios liked what they saw (no pun intended) when Saw came out, and much of the positive fan reaction was towards the genius of the death puzzles, not to mention the controversy over the rather brutal titular amputation. Other studios ran with this and turned it more into torture-centric style, focusing on brutality and disgust rather then actual horror. See there's one major difference between Saw and its \"contemporaries\" that a good chunk of the critics fail to see. Saw has a fucking plot. In fact, Saw is very plot-centric, pushing it dangerously close to the thriller category. After all the screenwriter studied Seven for inspiration when it came to the actual investigation parts of this movie, but luckily it's not and has sufficient scares to carry the sometimes hefty storytelling.\nCary Elwes stars as the captured Doctor Gordon and while he definitely has presence on screen, he can be a little wooden and his accent slips a lot. His companion in the room is a far weaker actor, but he's not bad. The acting of the side characters is adequate, but could have used the hand of a stronger director. The finest acting moments come when the characters are just screaming for their lives, a chilling reminder of the stakes of Jigsaws games.\n\tThe costumes and sets in Saw are all gritty and dirty. The traps all have an industrial, twisted steampunk vibe to them which was so popular that Lionsgate changed its logo to reflect it. The room that the two are in feels gross, just in how it looks and how the actors interact with it. Saw is made rather uniquely, with a lot of digital filters and such added to make it feel dark and dirty. It feels very different then any other horror movie pre-2000s and the films that came out at the time. Of course after Saw this kind of tone became more popular, even if Saw wasn't directly responsible for this trend. \nThere are plenty of fast edits and time lapses that all add to the chaos on screen and it's frankly something I haven't seen very often. This is the very early work of James Wan, who just released The Conjuring and these two movies couldn't be more night and day, but there are still some similarities. The unique camera angles and the slow silence surrounding the horror in particular are things that you can pick up on, but there's a noticeably higher level of skill in The Conjuring that shows he's grown as a director.\n \tThe effects in this movie are quite good, when they're seen. The traps are really where they shine, but other then that it's mostly just blood. Saw has a reputation of being super gory, and to be fair it has gory concepts, but they're barely shown on screen. Wan adapts the technique that Toby Hooper used for Texas Chainsaw Massacre and leaves most things to your imagination. Funny how both of those are considered the goriest mainstream films ever made. The gory reputation that Saw has is unfairly given to it by its sequels, which admittedly do amp up the effects. However, Saw is better and more timid then its follow-ups and it can be seen on its own, as long as you don't let the \"gore\" deter you.\n\tThe writing for Saw... well it's hard to call it a mess. It's fast and loose with time and I typically like that, but in this film it seems to be utilized more as a way to confuse the audience until the last minute. It's not terrible, because at the end everything makes sense, but during that interim it can get annoying. It's mostly made up for with the fantastic twist ending that does leave your jaw on the floor and also highlights how this film was tailored to make that twist work. Not that you'll need much thinking to see that, since the movie quickly edits together plenty of footage from over the course of the movie and throws it in your face, so much so that it actually gets annoying.\n A good deal of taste comes in to judging how effective that journey is since it's very much not perfect. If you like dark and horrific movies then you'll forgive the films clumsiness, but if you're not a fan, then these misgivings are only going to grind against you more. That may seem like stating the obvious, but when 50% of critics praise the film and 50% hate it, then it becomes pretty clear that personal taste dramatically impacts your perspective of Saw more then your average movie.\nSaw is a thrill ride through the elaborate plan of a killer, whose unique nature really makes this film stand out as one of the greats of the horror genre. One does not need to see the body tearing traps of the sequels to see this convoluted, but well planned thriller/horror flick with an ending that I consider one of the best I've seen in horror or in film in general. If you can get past the dark concepts and the brutal traps, you might find yourself just as engrossed in the mystery as the detectives and as terrified as the victims.",

This film is not only the leads up to their mysterious appearance of the chamber, but it also gives full detail of what the killer does and why he loves doing it. The performances were pretty generic in terms of horror, but the pacing in this film was really well done.

James Wan ended the film with the way that it should have been ended, with the cliffhanger that distressed us. The whole point of the film is to make you feel uncomfortable and how much more comfortable would you feel if you didn't know what happened after that. If they had stopped after just this film, people would still be talking about how they wish they knew what happened to jigsaw and all of his contestants in his game. After seeing the second film I could already tell that James Wan did not direct it . I did not feel distressed after watching it, I felt almost relieved which is the feeling that I did not want to have at all after watching a gruesome movie like that. This film, if it had just ended it would be considered to be one of the greatest horror flicks of all time. But what's the reputation that came after its sequels people believe that the first one was just as bad when really it wasn't.",

While I still believe that the concept was unbelievably ridiculous, I was still surprised at the directions the plot went. There were a lot of twists and dramatic scenes. \nBut what surprised me the most was actually the characters. I saw this movie expecting the characters to be completely 1-dimensional flat uninteresting dull role odels that just kinda had to be there for the torture scenes to happen. However, not only were they 3-dimensional (for the most part), they were also pretty damn relatable. There was a lot of psychologic philosophy in this film too. \nSo, to recap briefly: Great characters, good story, lots of nice unexpected twists, a lot of gory violence, but still a ridiculously silly concept. 4/5 stars",

            "content": "\"Most people are so ungrateful to be alive.\" - Jigsaw Killer\n\nSaw is a gory, and really disturbing psychological thriller that actually teaches an important life lesson.  It teaches you to appreciate your life.  What the Jigsaw killer does is he goes around kidnapping people who he thinks doesn't appreciate their lives, or whom he thinks is wasting their life.  So he puts them physical and or psycholigical torture.  His traps he refers to as \"games,\" and when the person wakes up there is either a tape or a video their telling them \"I would like to play a game.\"  He then tells them what he wants them to do and how to survive.  His traps are escapable, because he wants you to survive so you can come out of it with a greater appreciation for life.  He has picked people for his games who have tried suicide, and who have been junkies.  That is the concept of the film.  The first film inspired six others, which weren't as good.  The third one was just as good, but that was the only one.  The film is interesting, but a twisted one.\n\nAmanda (Shawnee Smith) was the only one to ever survive one of his games.  She woke up in a chair with a metal trap around her face.  It is known as the reverse bear trap.  Instead of closing like a bear trap it opens.  Once she sets the timer off she has one minute to get the key for it or it will open and rip her mouth open, and kill her.  The video she watched had a really freaky puppet with a spooky voice that told her all of this.  The puppet told her that the key is in the stomach of her dead cellmate.  She was the junky he tested.  When she found the body he opened his eyes and she realized he was still alive and she had to cut him open.  They don't show his stomach being cut open because they didn't have the budget to make it look great.  The film doesn't make anything way too graphic in my opinion because of a really low budget, which is good because it leaves it to your imagination.  She did win and the puppet came out on a tricycle and told her \"Congratulations you are still alive.  Most people are so ungrateful to be alive, but not you. Not anymore.\"  In the third film they tell you what happened with her after that.  That is the story of the one girl who lived.  But that is not a spoiler of the end; it is a flashback of an investigation that Doctor Gordon was a part of.\n\nDoctor Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell) wake up in a disgusting disused bathroom with their ankles chained to pipes, and they have no idea where they are and how they got there.  The also don't know each other.  The whole film is about them trying to figure out why they are there, and how they got there.  There is a cop named David Tapp (Danny Glover) spying on Doctor Gordon's house.  They both find tapes in their pockets, and they are both given a different set of instructions.  Adam must escape the bathroom by six o'clock or he will be left there to rot.  Doctor Gordon must kill Adam before six o'clock or else his family will die.  It is set up so that only one of them can live, and even if they do their jobs they probably won't live.  The film goes back into their lives, the life of the cop, and flashbacks of the investigations of the Jigsaw murders.\n\nWhat makes this good is that it is more of an intellectual horror film.  Some people just say it is stupid and gory but those people don't pay attention to the plot at all.  It is a very thought provoakitive film, that is suspenseful, and scary at certain times.  That is why I like this film.  I showed it to my Dad, and he didn't think he would like it and he thought it was really good, and he usually hates gory stuff.  Well I know my Dad well enough to be able to tell what he will like, so I knew he would like this.\n\nThe guy who plays Adam, his name is Leigh Wannell and he wrote the screenplay for this film, and he came up with the whole idea by himself.  He and James Wan were right out of film school and looking to do a film together.  Whannell came up with an idea that two guys would wake up in a room and not know where they are.  The idea was made so the film would be cheap and easy to make.  The idea of the Jigsaw killer came from when Whannell was working a terrible summer job and getting headaches from it.  He went to go see a doctor and started to worry and think, \"What if they tell me I have a tumor, and I don't have that much more time to live?\"  Then he realized that he should make a killer that is in that condition.  He got the title when he was writing a lot of words down and then he wrote down \"Saw\" in a red ink and he thought it looked so scary because it looked like blood.  It kind of shows how certain things happen for a reason.  He then wrote a screenplay, which had a few flaws but was still really good.  Then James Wan made the film in only 18 days.  That is how this film was created.  When it came out it was so big that they decided to make more.  He would write the screenplays for the next two and produce the others.  The mastermind behind the series was the dumbest character in the movie.  The films dropped off once he stopped writing them.  The 2nd one was a huge drop off from this one, but I think he figured out what was wrong with it, and he wrote a screenplay for the third one, which was better then this one.  Whannell in my opinion has a twisted mind, but a creative one.\n\nDon't read this unless you have seen it and don't want to see the rest of the films\n-----Spoilers-----\n\nAfter Doctor Gordon crawled out of the bathroom he found a steam pipe, which he used to cauterize his wound.  They show that in Saw 7.  He ended up becoming one of Jigsaws accomplices, and helped him with every game that involved surgery.  You have to watch 6 more movies after this just to know weather or not he survived.  The series is amazing the way they are all tied together, and they are tricky so you do have to watch them all.  It is like an addicting TV show.  It explains things about everybody's lives in different films, and explains things that went unexplained in one film in another.  A trilogy that only had a few good ones, but is incredibly well done.  The greatest horror series for sure.",

No one, it seems, did not expect such a success - the picture has managed to pay off a hundredfold in worldwide box office! Deserved? Yes!\r\n\r\nOf course, the idea of this film is not new. In the nineties, for example, was \"Cube\" and many others movies. But the creators of \"Saw\" were able to shoot such a thriller that make your hair stand on end, and run over the skin crawl. There is almost no blood, meat, and other abominations, but there is a scary atmosphere, strongly pressing on the psyche.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, for such a cool movie were produced annually continue, each time getting worse and worse. A masterpiece the first part I'm willing to reconsider many times with great interest, watching the rapidly developing story and an unexpected ending.",
