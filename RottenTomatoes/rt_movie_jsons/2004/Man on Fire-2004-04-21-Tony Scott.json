Just as Creasy begins to develop a fondness for the young girl, a bloodthirsty gunman (Jesús Ochoa) kidnaps her. Now, Creasy must pick off a succession of corrupt cops and criminals to reach his ultimate object of vengeance.",

Although there are some emotional scenes, the emphasis of Denzel's character as an assassin is already clear and doesn't need to be constantly shown with excessive violence.

He's got a rock solid leading man in Oscar-winner Denzel Washington, and a most expressive child actor in young Dakota Fanning. The script doesn't add up to much and shortchanges the morality of the tale. Scott's visual style is downright experimental--quick zooms, hand-cranked cameras, whip-lash camera pans, rapid cutting--but his cleverest visual touch was how he handles the subtitles. They enliven the Spanish-speaking scenes (and some English ones too) as they nearly pop off the screen and are used for dramatic effect. The violence and torture verges on sadomasochistic in the third act. But Scott gets a lot of mileage out of his leading man and young lady, and gets a dirty job done",

But on the other hand as I got older and I saw the reviews that mixed and positive and different websites. On Rotten Tomatoes it had a 39% from the critics and 89% from the audience and then on IMDB it had a 7.7/10 and I was gutted, so I thought \"You know what, screw it, I'm gonna see it.\" So I popped it in and watched it and you know what, I'm really impressed by it. I am one of those people who really loved it. No wonder why critics hated on this one, it is impressive. A former CIA SAD/SOG officer, John Creasy played by Denzel Washington, meets his old friend, Paul Rayburn played by Christopher Walken, who runs a security firm in Mexico. He convinces him to take a bodyguard position to protect Samuel Ramos' daughter, Pita played by Dakota Fanning. Creasy is struggling with alcoholism, burnout, and guilt over his actions with the CIA, He teaches Pita to become a professional swimmer, not to flinch at the gunshot. Waiting outside Pita's piano lesson, He realises that she is about to be abducted, killing those including police officers who try to kidnap her but wounded from his injuries. He's thinking that he is a suspect but AFI agent Miguel Manzano stated to him that two officers he killed are corrupted. So now it's up to John Creasy to find those who kidnapped Pita for ransom. You know, the film does have some cuteness in the first act because of Dakota Fanning. I mean, yeah she is a kid and all, she really does give her performance a unique taste. I can't believe there would be a scene where Denzel tell Datoka to burp while in piano lesson. The cinematography is really great even if it look like Mexico. The action doesn't kick in until about fifty minutes later. The first half is just some kid family friendly stuff and the second half is where the revenge action takes it's place. What can I say this movie that hasn't been said? All I can say is that it's an underrated unique action film, that is if you were looking at Netflix you will see that it is mostly liked by many who have seen it. I think it is one of the memorable films I've seen, if not the most memorable. Yes siree!",

As an adaptation of the source material, author AJ Quinnell would choose this easily. It is easy to see why that is the case, there are more lines in this version lifted from the source material and more of the spirit is there, apparently Quinnell intensely disliked the 1987 film going as far to saying that he couldn't recognise any of what he wrote in there. On its own terms, it is not an easy pick. Both films are uneven but both films are also very worthwhile (yes, will admit to liking the 1987 film despite it not being a great film), they have a numerous amount of strengths but both have quite a few faults.\n\nTalking about this 2004 film, it's uneven with some things that stop it from being as on fire as its lead performances. As said above though there is a lot to like and enough to make it more than watchable. Visually, 'Man on Fire' has its moments. The locations are both stunning and gritty and there is evidence of a slick atmospheric stylishness and director Tony Scott providing a few inventive touches. The film is hampered quite severely however by Scott excessively going overboard on the visual style, too much of it is more gimmicky and self-indulgent than it is clever and imaginative which is a real shame.\n\n'Man on Fire' has a haunting and cool music score that really adds to the film and drives the action well. The script has wit and tension.\n\nStorytelling, like with the production values, is more problematic. It is very successful in the first half, the central chemistry between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning is truly heartfelt and beautifully written. Really liked that the care and trust were realistically gradual and not evident straight away. In the more action-oriented and thriller-like second half, the action is well-choreographed and suitably uncompromising, it's fun and suspenseful and it makes more consistent sense than the 1987 film.\n\nIt is let down sadly by the pace being drawn out in places while the ending is more logical, more exciting and more emotional in the 1987 film, it's a bit of an illogical fizzler here. The film is sadly rather too overlong too by about twenty minutes, this could have been cleared up by tightening the pace in the second half.\n\nDenzel Washington excels in the lead role as does a charming and beyond her years mature Dakota Fanning. Their chemistry is one of the highlights of 'Man on Fire'. The supporting cast is more uneven, with a fun if underused turn from Christopher Walken and a strong Radha Mitchell but Mickey Rourke especially is wasted in a role little more than a throwaway. The villains too could have been more threatening. Scott's direction succeeds in the action and direction of the actors but is really messy visually.\n\nOverall, worthwhile but not the on fire film it could and should have been. 6/10 Bethany Cox",

The directing keeps the plot barrelling towards the cliff.  How this got so many negative reviews is hard to fathom.   I rate this as one of the two or three finest performances from Washington.

I'd have been more than content to watch this charmingly heartwarming, albeit somewhat cliche, unlikely buddy story but also appreciated the abrupt tonal shift to a revenge fueled action suspense film ala John Wick.\n\nThe story was well crafted and allowed for the exploration into more dimensions of some of these characters than I typically expect from an action movie.

            "content": "First thing to note about Man on Fire : this is not an action film, even if it markets itself as one! It's a thriller for sure, but there's barely any action, honestly. But apart from that disappointing element, this is a good enough genre entry. I found it interesting how the film takes its time to develop the chemistry between the character of Denzel Washington and the character of the young Dakota Fanning. Both of their performances are strong, and their relationship is actually quite touching, for this type of movie. It's got themes of guilt and love. It's also good at showing us the reality of the violent kidnappings that really go on in Mexico. But unfortunately, it spirals downwards during the gritty, bloody second half, as I was expecting a ton of gonzo shootouts, like in Washington's later action pic The Equalizer (2014). But no, it's just a tedious cat-and-mouse game. And the ending sucked ass a bit too. Overall, this isn't a terrible film, but it's just alright. I would recommend it to die hard fans of the genre!",

This fantasy must have some audience traction cause they just keep making them. This one stands out thanks to cool shaky cam editing tricks and a swell performance by engaging young Dakota Fanning as John Wick's puppy, the rationale for the rampaging to surely come.

When she's kidnapped by the hands of Mexican extortionists in the countries capital, Creasey uses his personal affinity with the \"Art of death\" to enact revenge on those involved, break apart the kidnapping ring and reveal the government corruption that helps to conceal it.

Instead it becomes a truly intense, riveting, emotionally-harrowing film not just about revenge, but a man battling his own personal demons and his bond with the little girl, Pita. It's a gripping film that will thrill you, but it will also give you unexpected moments of heart and emotion.

The reviews ay things along the lines of, \"well, the first half was fine, but the second half too violent\"... Really ? Not to give away the story, but Creasy does what Creasy has been trained to do and do well. Extra props for Christopher Walken eccentric but concerned ex- merc, and Radha Mitchell as a pampered wife and mother who shows some spine when in crisis. Dakota Fanning is nine(?) , and she is great... very naturally and adorable but also not too cutesy and her scenes with Washington are really, believable (Denzel obviously has kids of his own).

            "content": "Another decade-old movie here. This one's from 2004. I remember seeing it before, when it was new. I liked it then. Let's see how I like it now.\n\nThis movie takes its time. With a running time of about two and a half hours, the first half is dedicated solely to set up the who, where and why of the story. Even though the first few minutes of the film already give away the obvious plot, the movie manages to keep a certain level of suppressed suspense throughout half its running time. John Creasy (Denzel Washington) reluctantly takes a bodyguard job in Mexico City. He's a former special ops agent, now an alcoholic, who is at the brink of taking his own life. To his surprise, this new job gives him something to live for: Lupita Ramos (Dakota Fanning), the young girl he's hired to protect. Of course, she eventually gets kidnapped, but not after she's touched his heart.\n\nDenzel Washington is one of the greatest actors of our time. And while Man on Fire is not the best of his career, he certainly hasn't received the praise he deserves. Most unfavourable reviews of this film state that all the visual beauty and impeccable production of this movie only serve one purpose: the gory and violent second half of this film.\n\nI disagree. Not only do the visual beauty and impeccable production serve the story as a whole, I will postulate that the second half of this movie isn't half as bad as it's made out to be. Yes, Creasy clips some fingers. Yes, Creasy obliterates an entire hand with a shotgun. Yes, Creasy even kills a man with a MacGuyver-style explosive in his rectum. Sounds violent, doesn't it? Now that would be a problem for me if those actions were solely for entertainment purposes or for Mr. Creasy's personal satisfaction. But they aren't. He very clearly strategizes to connect the dots that will lead him to the man responsible for Pita's kidnapping.\n\nOf course you can condemn the violence just for the acts in themselves. But what you'd be doing at the same time is reveal how naive you are about the world we live in. If sitting these criminals down with a soda or a cup of coffee was sufficient to get some credible information out of them, I'm sure Creasy would have done it. If waiting for Mexico's judicial system was sufficient, he'd done that too. But Creasy is not as naive as these movie critics. He doesn't commit violent acts because \"bloody=good\" in the movie theater or because he enjoys separating fingers from hands. He merely adapts himself to his environment and starts speaking the languague of the degenerates he's dealing with.\n\nIn doing so, he manages in no-time what the combined do-gooders police officers and truth-hunting journalists never managed in decades: get to the people who are responsible.\n\nIt seems like the audience is split on the subject, which is fine in itself. It's just unfortunate that I get to read attempts by 'critics' like movie-mom Nell Minow from 'Common Sense Media', who will get full credit for the following quoted review:\n\n\"Parents need to know that this movie has extreme and graphic violence, including torture and attempted and actual suicide (portrayed as honorable). Children are in peril. A character has a drinking problem. Characters use strong language. The movie's strengths include strong inter-racial friendships and respect for spiritual values.\"\n\nWhat? Since when do parents not know that when they see 'Rating: R' on movie that they will get at least some if not all of the above? 'R' has been the new 'NC-17' for quite a while now. The tagline of the quoted review is \"Extremely violent; not for kids.\" Well Duh. What did you expect, go check the R-rated isle on Netflix and see if you can find something that is actually very much suitable for kids. In her defense, Minow's description of the movie is spot-on. But then 'Sex' gets a 3/5 warning for this film and 'Drinking, drugs & smoking' gets 0/5? Did we really see the same thing?\n\nLong story short: most critics are either so lost that they forgot that 'R' means there is some clearly adult-only material here; or they are showing signs of extreme naiveté about their world view and how to deal with organized crime sydicates.\n\nPros: good production value, good acting, etc.\nCons: If you believe that violence does not and should not exist in this world, go see something else.\nVerdict: Go see",

As much as I love Tarantino's script in True Romance, I still consider Man on Fire to be Tony Scott's best film. I'm also a fan of Denzel Washington's work so their collaboration together in this film is probably the main reason why I enjoy it so much. This was their first film together, but they went on to make three more action films after this one which I enjoyed to a lesser degree. Scott's last film, Unstoppable was a pleasant surprise, but they never matched the quality of Man on Fire. I'm probably alone in this claim, considering it wasn't received well by the critics. There are two other performances here that I really enjoyed. Christopher Walken playing Paul Rayburn, one of Creasy's (Denzel Washington) closest friend and Dakota Fanning as Lupita, the girl that Creasy is hired to protect. Fanning gave one of the cutest child performances I've seen and you couldn't help but feel  enraged during the scene in which she was kidnapped. That believable performance and the strong chemistry she had built with Washington is one of the main reasons why the familiar revenge tale manages to work so well and engage its audience emotionally. These are the roles in which Denzel seems to excel at, and he recently proved it once again in The Equalizer. Man on Fire is over the top in its portrayal of violence and it's very stylish, but I was always entertained. Well I think I've written enough about this film so I'll be off to Blue Bayou now! \n\n\"Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting.\"\n\n\"Last wish?

The sacrificial lamb suits Denzel in this tale down to his \"winkled\" character's name and even more creased psyche/soul -- the sort of salvation one finds when they find a means to propitiation. The script is perfect, the shots gritty and nimble, the flowing and localized subtitles blazing new ground for foreign-situated flicks. Always innovating, the Scotts make Hollywood a new city full of new colors and new atmospheres, freeing us from the homogenized we are so clearly bored with as ticket sales plummet for every movie that refuses to free itself.

The relationship between Denzel and Fanning is very well put together, but the film doesn't do enough to explain Denzel's personal problems, and certainly doesn't do enough to resolve them.  I really don't buy that ending.

However, Marc Anthony is so bad as her father, he shouldn't be in this movie with Denzel. Christopher Walken is great too, but is in it for a few minutes. My biggest complaints of this movie are its predictability (a thorn in all hostage/kidnapping movies since they all follow the same plot points) and Tony Scott's psychotic way of shooting everything. This film does not need flashing white shots, pulsating colors, over the top shaky cam, and the way Tony has to rotate the camera around everything. This film would have been so much better with a different director who knows how to let the actors do their job instead of getting in the way and distracting the viewer.",

The story is set in Mexico during the time this movie was released because that was when the country had a high kidnapping rate whereas in the original, the film was set in Italy for the exact same reason so director Tony Scott argued that if he had to set this movie in Italy like the original movie or the book this film was based off, this film would be a period piece so he made this film a basic reboot.
