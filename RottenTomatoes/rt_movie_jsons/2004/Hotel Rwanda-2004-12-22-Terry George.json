    "summary": "Hutu Paul Rusesabagina manages the H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines and lives a happy life with his Tutsi wife and their three children, but when Hutu military forces initiate a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Tutsi minority, Paul is compelled to allow refugees to take shelter in his hotel. As the U.N. pulls out, Paul must struggle alone to protect the Tutsi refugees in the face of the escalating violence later known as the Rwandan genocide.",

            "content": "\"Hotel Rwanda is a powerful and moving film that tells the story of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The film is an important reminder of the atrocities that took place in Rwanda and highlights the bravery of ordinary people who stood up against violence and hate. Don Cheadle delivers a powerhouse performance as Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who risked his own life to shelter refugees from the conflict. The film is emotionally charged and brings to light the important issue of humanity and the responsibility to act in the face of injustice. Hotel Rwanda is a must-watch film that will leave a lasting impression and inspire you to stand up for what is right.\"",

            "content": "Despite the controversy surrounding the man behind the myth, friendly reminder that Paul Rusesabagina was sentenced to 25 years in prison by Rwanda in 2018, and the UN maintains that he was kidnapped, tortured, and subsequently convicted in an unfair trial. As of today, he is still a prisoner.\n\nOne of the most heartbreaking and brutal civil conflicts in modern times, a narrative of manufactured hatred that boiled over into genocide while the rest of the world looked in the other direction. While Cheadle certainly displays his leading man chops here and the film itself is well-intentioned (bringing American studio money to a major nonfiction event), Hotel Rwanda suffers from being sanitized for mass consumption, sacrificing authentic brutality to avoid turning stomachs so tickets could sell. Rusesabagina feels to be too saintly of a character in this depiction, and the film keeps insisting on drawing him into difficult decisions before offering a lifeline at the last moment that avoids moral complexity or even showing any explicit violence; in a butchering that resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths, to smooth over these details dulls their impact and the lessons that can be taken from the horror.\n\nExamples of media inciting violence are shown here that Americans seemed so sure in 2004 they would be immune to, which are now making inroads into the mainstream and creating their own culture wars. (3/5)",

Him driving through a dense fog and hitting a rough patch in the road only to find that the bumpiness is because bodies litter the street. Him charging through the hotel looking for his family and then dreadfully realizing that he needs to go to the roof because he told his family to jump if the Hutu soldiers came.\n\nIt's a well-made film that tells an emotionally resonant story with historical accuracy.

There is some debate as to whether Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle) was a hero or a profiteer, but this is irrelevant in the larger scheme of things.  Hotel Rwanda is a powerful film about mankind's inhumanity to his fellow man and an indictment of the majority of the rest of the world who turned their collective back on the atrocities being committed.  Cheadle gives a strong performance, as does Sophie Okonedo in an Oscar-nominated role as Paul's wife. While not as graphic as one might suspect, the movie remains a powerful indictment of those who failed to act.",

            "content": "This film recounts the fateful tragedy surrounding the Rwandan genocide in 1994, when the rivalry between the two major ethnic groups, Hutu and Tutsi, escalated into a bloodbath resulting in around one million deaths. The hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina, who took in thousands of potential victims in his hotel and thus saved many lives, became a celebrated hero.\n\nRusesabagina is embodied by Don Cheadle. Initially a successful manager with a homogeneous family life, he is constantly tested by the constant threat of Hutu soldiers against his loved ones. Being Hutu himself, he is never really affected by this threat. Cheadle's fragile performance permanently gets under your skin. His character has to deal with betrayal, impossible choices and sacrifices throughout the film. Cheadle's close acting also means you always buy into his suffering. Sophie Okonedo gives an even more emotional performance as Paul's wife Tatiana. She is constantly intent on protecting her children by any means necessary and suggests this form of fear in a very subtle way. Her chemistry with Cheadle is very authentic and makes this unconditional love for each other very clear. Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte, who plays a commander, don't appear very often but shine in their few scenes with thought-provoking dialogue.\n\nHotel Rwanda brings viewers closer to a subject that has received too little attention and care in world history. This is done in a very extreme way, because some of the images are very hard to watch during the two-hour running time. Therefore, this is not a film that you necessarily have to see several times. It is nevertheless an absolute must-see, as the harsh reality is communicated here to the point. Even tribes from the same country can cause huge damage. The greatest danger does not always come from an external enemy. Hotel Rwanda is brutal, very real and rounded off by its human performances to make a very meaningful historical drama.",

I think people often judge this movie the wrong way. I believe it is not trying to serve as a documental, so judge it as it is: a movie. If you want a completely accurate depiction of the Rwandan genocide, go watch a documental or read a full report about it. However, I look at this movie as a story that is based and/or inspired from certain events that actually happened in real life. Sure, it uses the same characters (for example, Paul Rusesabagina really exists in real life) but it doesn't necessarily needs to be completely accurate becasue it's a movie. It was great for me. It has moments that make the tension rise a lot, it makes you feel worried at times, and makes you cheer at others. In general, this is a must-see for me.",

Again, we follow a particular individual, Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle), as a way of gaining entrance and insight into what otherwise might be a horrific but depersonalised tragedy, full of statistics about how many died but lacking a hand to hold onto.  To show us the Rwandan conflict between Hutus and Tutsis, director Terry George follows Ruesabagina, the manager of a Belgian hotel in the capital Kigali who takes in Tutsi and other refugees, offering them asylum in the hotel (as armed forces and youth gangs hover outside).  Ruesabagina is Hutu himself but his wife is Tutsi, making him a \u00e2traitor\u00e2? in the eyes of the Hutu coup leaders.  He is a wheeler-dealer of sorts, always keeping the power elite happy with gifts and favours \u00e2\" but he finds that they are no longer there for him when war breaks out.  Nor are the Westerners who soon flee the country and fail to send aid.  Nick Nolte\u00e2(TM)s UN colonel does his best in an impossible situation but it is Rusesabagina\u00e2(TM)s quick thinking that keeps (some) people alive.  Cheadle is good in the central role, as is Sophie Okonedo who plays his wife (and a number of other actors in Rwandan parts are also convincing, whether they be corrupt generals, warlords, or hotel workers).  In the end, however, the enormity of the crisis, its woeful tragic effects on innocent people, tends to dwarf the story of Paul and his (Herculean) efforts to save people.  As a(nother) history lesson about what can happen when the world isn\u00e2(TM)t watching (or caring), this is an important document.  And as a demonstration of moral courage in the face of evil, let\u00e2(TM)s hope we could all be so brave.",

While I don\u2019t read up on events like this, I am always fascinated to learn about them in film (even if some of the facts can be slightly distorted in order to make a good script.) Hotel Rwanda is a devastating film because it takes you right into the heart of the Rwandan genocide, and makes you come to grips with the underlying evil that can sprout up in humans. There were a number of scenes that made me sick to my stomach, and I had to keep reminding myself that the reality was probably even worse because they have to sanitize things to some degree in order to show them in a PG-13 film. Don Cheadle gives a great performance as a man who feels caught in the middle of all this tension in his nation. I felt like I was faced with these same moral dilemmas along with him, and his devotion to his family and the people of his nation was admirable. I also thought Sophie Okonedo was excellent as his wife, and she had a lot of tough emotional scenes to perform. Most of the other sympathetic characters were well-acted, and I was surprised how powerful the handful of scenes with Nick Nolte felt. My one complaint with the cast was how little we saw Joaquin Phoenix. His character seemed to have an arc that happens almost completely off-screen, and yet he could have brought something interesting to the film if he was in there more. Hotel Rwanda is not the kind of movie where I would say I enjoyed watching it. It contains a lot of dark stuff, and it\u2019s hard to take when you know we\u2019re just getting a taste of the actual horror that occurred. However, it is the kind of movie I can say I\u2019m glad I watched. Not only was it informative, it also did a good job of honoring a man who did what was right against frightening opposition. This isn\u2019t a seamless biopic, because you can sense some of the creative liberties that the writers took to give it a proper dramatic narrative, but there was enough authenticity in the feelings and emotions to make up for any tweaks that were made. This is the kind of movie we all should watch just to remind ourselves how disgusting hate can be, and the stupidity of some men\u2019s reasons for hating one another.",

When I finished watching this movie, I prayed so hard for all these people involved. I prayed for their peace and happiness, I prayed for their health and wellness, I prayed for their finances and fears. I wish with all my heart I could of helped but I was only 9. I wish the people in that country could see my comment and hear my heart felt prays for them. Im so sorry for what people, and the children had to see and go through. I'm so sorry we didn't help more then we did, I'm sorry we turned our backs on you, I'm sorry for all the family you lost. It's just absolutely awful. If I as one person could of changed that and made it go away I would have. I wish I could of. We sit around here complaining about everything that we don't like or doesn't go our way and look at what they were going  Through! Shame on us! Like the actor said \"Jesus Christ, I am so ashamed!\" ME TOO! Everyone should watch this movie, feel what they felt, maybe we can change the world. Until then, I will continue to pray, pray hard!

A magnificent story that stands out for the incredible character and humanism of its main cast before what could be the worst nightmare anyone could live.\nA truly inspiring film from which to learn, albeit a little to be more aware of the events that today shake so many countries in the international community and those are conflicts that still do not end and from which we choose to ignore. Terry George efface the typical cliches of the war and focuses on few characters and their work. Without great effects, it is possible to consolidate a film that studies the psychological character of humans and their racial and ideological conceptions that on a collective plane result in unimaginable facts. The way in which Cheadle protected his family, in addition to the hundreds of children and elders he guarded at the Hotel Mille Collines is an act that no one could do; He risked his life at all times.\n\n\"The world ignored Rwanda when we really needed it. Unfortunately, even now the world is still ignoring us\" - real Paul Rusesabagina. 93/100",

A man who saved lives really by playing the enemy's game and being willing to bargain and even compromise his dignity to save lives.  It's not something you see very often on film.

At times, they thoroughly believe in that tattoo; but in others, they gaze at it with a tinge of regret.  I'm sure America has felt that potent remorse when reflecting on the Holocaust or the Cambodian genocide.  But as one character in \"Hotel Rwanda\" puts it, the majority of our nation hears of the crimes, says \"that's awful,\" turns right around, and finishes their dinner.  I'm guilty of it, you're guilty of it; we're all guilty of it.  There is no one to blame in particular - an ordinary person can't simply drop everything and become a humanitarian - but in \"Hotel Rwanda,\" the that's awful mentality is transformed from a mere numbers game to a stinging reality.\n          In 1994, millions of Rwandan citizens were killed in a response to the snapping of the racial tension between the two predominant ethnicities, the Hutu and the Tutsi.  When Tutsi rebels assassinated the country's dictator, Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana, the slowly growing mentality that the Tutsi, who migrated to Rwanda early in its foundation, were not natural-born citizens and therefore a threat to the country finally hit its climax.  In response, Hutu soldiers began exterminating Tutsi civilians without even batting an eye.  \n\tBut amidst any atrocity there is always a hero; in the Rwandan genocide's case, that hero was Paul Rusesabagina, the manager of the Hotel Des Milles Collines.  By allowing scores of would-be victims to stay in the fluctuating rooms and hallways with no charge, he saved nearly 1,300 people.  The film presents him not with the rugged exuberance of a John Wayne type, but rather with a man who feels the need to do the right thing and has the means to do so.\n\tWe are only given glimpses into the barbarities that took place in the varying neighborhoods and regions, but \"Hotel Rwanda\" succeeds in the fact that it's not a lecture or an in-your-face history lesson.  It's by turns enlightening, grim and affecting.  Because Rusesabagina is Hutu and his wife is Tutsi (therefore his kids are in grave danger as well), there is an added franticness that makes every second more precious than the last.\n\tRusesbagina is portrayed by Don Cheadle, his wife by Sophie Okonedo, with Nick Nolte playing a conflicted French Canadian colonel who is forced to make tough decisions in an environment where there isn't any time to make tough decisions.  Cheadle's performance is so poignant because he is willing to risk everything he has in order to save others, despite the fact that he may die in the process.  To go from fledging hotel manager to a saint within a matter of hours isn't a smooth task, but he accents Rusesbagina's integrity with a devout spirit.  What should he do, send every Tutsi out into the street to die? As Rusesbagina's wife, Okonedo is the emotional core of the film, fearing endlessly for her kids and her valiant husband.  Okonedo lays every sense she has down on the table; we feel what she feels.\n\t\"Hotel Rwanda\" is a terrifically acted and tremendously vigorous account of a monstrous part of our history.  Even though the majority of countries looked away, the film places us at an uncomfortable distance to the heinous event, making us rethink that entire not-my-country-not-my-problem philosophy.",

The story is about the Hutu genocide of the Tutsi population seen through the eyes of Paul Rusesabagina, hotel manager of hotel Milles Collines, which for a short period of time became a refugee camp for Tutsi refugees. Paul himself is Hutu, but his wife is Tutsi and he is, therefore, forced to use all his connections and saved up favors to save his family and friends from an attempt to exterminate the entire Tutsi population.\r\n\r\nThis independent film quite vividly brings to life one of the biggest tragedies of the 90s and even educates about the origin of the hate in Rwanda that dates back to the Belgian colonisation. A very emotional film about one of the saddest chapters of history and the fact that it happened less than 20 years ago is terrifying to say the least. The film has a lot of characters to care about and very convincing performances from Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, Fana Mokoena and Hakeem Kae-Kazim, especially impressive is Don Cheadle who rises to deliver his best performance so far.",

Don Cheadle was the perfect choice for the film's hero, Paul Rusesabagina.  His accent is incredibly convincing and his acting captures the intense emotion that this character must endure as he saves thousands.  The other big names do not really get a chance to shine but add a lot of character to the film, from Nick Nolte's frustration with the U.N. to Jean Reno's sense of duty to these helpless victims and Joaquin Phoenix's compassion as he witnesses the slaughter of countless Rwandans.  These characters do not stand out but their polarizing emotions engage the sympathy of the audience.  Regardless of the acting, cinematography, and violence, the script is what creates the potent sensation of anguish that creates a connection between the characters onscreen and the people sitting in the audience.  It develops the perfect equation of getting to know the characters, interpolating historic fact with fiction, and showing the right amount of violence that is bearable to watch but difficult to stomach.  \"Hotel Rwanda\" may not be on my list of favorites but it is simply a great film.",

One of the film's remarkable feats is its ability to shock its audience and create tension by hinting at horrible acts of slaughter instead of showing them in your face. The lack of graphic reenactments of violence in Hotel Rwanda allows its stellar cast to deliver some of the most (realistic) moving performances in modern cinema. Don Cheadle in particular carries the bulk of the acting in this film, but you never doubt the guy for a second, and that's not to underplay the performances of the rest of the cast. Shifting gears a bit, the 1994 Rwandan genocide event is notable for its (almost ironic) absence of the United States and the other Western powers. \"rwanda's not worth a single vote to them,\" a statement from the film, is a blatant attack on America's (and the rest of the world's) silence on the matter. And now, 20 years later [4/28/14], there remains a lot of 'no-talk' on a number of important issues that face us--not as a country, but as living organisms on this planet that we share with non-human organisms--why? How is it possible that beings, capable of incredible feats of engineering, art, music, critical thought, etc, are blind (or simply choose to look past) to problems/dilemmas/etc that Need to addressed? It's easy to say that we will never forget about the holocaust ....but then what happened in Rwanda? Is there anything else happening at this very moment that needs to be stopped? I don't have any answers, but there's thing I know for sure--for the most part--not a single damn one of us has learned from \"acts of genocide\"....",

As the tribal differences fracture society and the country rips itself apart, Paul takes in refugees from the massacre and shelters them in the hotel while desperately trying to keep the rebel soldiers out. It is a harrowing story about the brutality of some, the attitude of the west and the bravery of one man in standing up for what is right and just. Cheadle is outstanding in the lead as is Sophie Okonedo as his wife Tatiana, both performances gaining Oscar nominations. I was also really impressed with Nick Nolte as Colonel Oliver, the UN soldier who has the task of trying to protect the hotel despite the apathy of world politicians to the situation.

Pretty intense movie when they get to the river road, but the story gets tied up a beat neater and happier than i imagine it did for many of the famiilies, perhaps a bit more heartbreak would have been more realistic, but i can understand not wanting to alienate the audience too much by offending them doubly for their ignorance of the situation.",

The script is well-written and, while its emotionally powerful, it feels fairly real and honest.\n\nIts a failry typical film considering its intense topic though- it feels true to its story but it also seems to tow the line to an extent, not an Oscar-machine by any account but still maybe a little too conventional for its own good. \n\nIts hard to criticise a film for being too much like a film though- its easy to do with something as unique as this but I'm not sure that that is fair- what we've got here is a great movie with plenty of great elements and some outstanding scenes- more than your fair share for any film and its certainly full of heart.\n\nIts too moulded though to be as great as it should be- it makes compromises for its audience with the main one being the typical hero-story mould that this film takes.

This terrifying story is one of powerful conception and is apparent when the violence escalades to mass proportions with executions taking out on the daily. This is where Paul Rusesabagina character is put into action as he helps shelter over a thousand Tutsi from the rebel Hutus.  \n\nDon Cheadle stars as Paul Rusesabagina and gives a performance accolade worthy; his performance truly shows the emotions embodying his character in this time of freighting circumstances. The supporting cast also gives top-notch performances all around. I enjoyed watching the movie thoroughly and felt as if the actors really gave great performances. \n\nThe direction is notable with a couple missteps in a few areas in particular the choice to make it a PG-13 rated movie. The story is impactful in nature but it could have been flushed out greatly with an R rating to not only hear about what was happening but also actually see it. That's one of the factors that made Steven Spielberg's Shindlers List's so impactful.

The first time I saw this movie, it was during a geography lesson, and just loved it from that moment.\nThe way Terry George portrays the true massacre is impressive, while tense. Rwanda is very well created and the story too, throughout the film raises several philosophical questions that leave you thinking for a long time. The massacre of Hutus against Tutsis recreated this very well and very real.\nDon Cheadle is superb, simply embodies his character and delivers this true hero was Paul Rusesabagina; Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic, her character is the most credible and he is unrecognizable.\nThe movie made ??me hate myself, and soo many people that the film petrays, that actually exist till this days. Tensing and exciting moments, the film is very real and so inspiring, with an ending that I could not ask for better.",

The DP's overlighting suggests that the scenery was created on a backlot, despite the fact it was filmed on location. The film's completely devoid of visual style or dramatic energy. I couldn't believe how visually insipid this movie was--it looked like a \"B\" movie from the 80s, absolutely uninspired. The camera shows no imagination or life, it simply sits there. Terry George challenges nothing. He uses words to paint a picture that could have been much more effective if the camera were let loose more. George puts more importance on the words of the script rather than showing them. If he were writing an op-end piece for a newspaper, that'd be dandy. But this is film and the medium has certain demands, the main one being it's visual.\n\nThe movie is polite and inoffensive to the point where it is offensive. The acting is good... the script works when it's not overtly preaching, and the story naturally unfolds. There's also a severe lack of tension and the drama doesn't feel as weighty as it should be, given the subject matter. Except for a few scenes in the beginning, the characters didn't feel like they were in much peril. For a film about this subject matter, I expected to be on the edge of my seat throughout. But it is watchable.",

And this film was depressing, the scene that stands out is the bus driving away. With the pastors yelling \"We can't leave the children\". The music and scenery surrounding that moment resulted in deep sadness, the highpoint of the film. The scenery and technicality of the movie was consistent, and Don Cheadle for the most part brought an energized performance. I believe the films greatest weakness was the editing by Naomi Geraghty who also edited for the 2011 film Limitless. I feel like plenty of the scenes dragged and the timing was off. The thrills in this film were practically not there, due to the fact that it keeps repeating itself. It overkilled on the thrills, by doing the same thing over and over again. Overall though it's a fair drama, with its share of shocking scenes. I suggest this for fans of the genre.",

I owned this film on DVD for years and didn't watch it. Not because I didn't want to. Because I knew it would be a hard movie to watch. I was right. But this is a movie everyone should see. It is a historical film about the bravery of a man and those around him in the face of impossible circumstances. However, what it is also about the value of human life. Not just the mindless slaughter of war and genocide, but also the value of human life to those looking on from outside. The problems of the world seem too big sometimes and we have a way of getting desensitized and shutting down. We've come to be used to seeing horrific images in our news reports. They do inspire sympathy, but sympathy does not fix the problem. Occasionally some of us get together and try to donate money or supplies to difficult areas of the world. It can make a difference in the short term, but not the long term. Some devote their lives to the cause of trying to fix these problems. We all lionize those who put themselves into the thick of it when they don't have to and try to make a difference, but they are too few and far between. Most don't truly believe the ways we currently try to fix these problems are that effective at all. Maybe one day we as people will stop drawing lines between each other. Maybe one day we will focus more on what brings us together than what separates us. Maybe one day people like me will feel like more than just someone with no money or resources, trying to take care of their own family, who doesn't really believe he can do anything of value for those in need thousands of miles away. I am a hypocrite. I too feel detached. I focus on what is right near me because its all I feel I can really effect and I feel the strongest responsibility to my family. I wish it were different in certain ways. I wish the powers and resources of the people of our planet were used to care for those in need of help and to stop violence, rather than moving around lines on a map. I wish we were evolved enough to find a better way to solve problems than murdering each other. I, like many, wish for many things I hope to see but don't know if I ever will. That's what this film left me with, above all else. A stark reminder of the inherent problems with how we humans see each other. How we shut our eyes to atrocities and how we need to stop.",
