The movie owns the silliness of the plot.  Where other profoundly silly plots take themselves way to seriously to be, this knows what it is and it has fun with it.  Not sure why some of the \"babies\" were dubbed.  The Bastidas twins who plays Rosita in the movie was 5 years at the time of the movie was made and her mouth was not altered by CGI, because the CGI was pretty weak.  So why couldn't she do her own talking?  Sure it's dumb but it's not suppose to be anything but dumb fun for kids.  Let the kids have some dumb fun.",

Tra that the stork.\nThe fairies?\nNo, my parents told me that ...\nWhat?\nNo. Yuck.\nYeah, I figured it was not.\nI can not believe my parents did not tell this.\nIf they knew where babies come from, they would not have one.\nLike the hot dogs, by the way.\nUpa!\nAnd how come I do not remember this place?\nYes, you remembered.\nWhen normal babies take away the pacifier ...\nBebCorp forget.\nAnd how is it that you're not normal?\nSome of us, the best ...\nwe selected for ...\nFor the greatest honor.\nBeing senior management.\nHere, Templeton, all the action.\nNaptime in Sector G.\nDoes this place is for babies operated?\nYes.\nMy dad says: \"Those who can, do things\".\n\"Those who do not supervise\".\nYour dad is a hippie.\nWhat happens when they grow up?\nWe do not grow.\nWe drink a top-secret formula that makes us be babies forever.\nTo work!

We can enter PerriCorp!\nAnd find out what the new puppy!\nIt's no use.\nYou are punishment.\nYour parents do not take us anywhere.\nYou're right. They believe that hate us.\n\"Hate\" is a strong word.\nCorrect, but strong.\nWe must convince them that we are truly brothers.\nClear.\nWe ...\nDetestamos?\nNo.\nWe please!\nNo. Let us ...\nWhat what what...\nWhat what what...\nWho, who, who ...\nNo.\nForget this.

Every actor in this movie is terrible. Even Jon Voight embarrasses himself here. Every \"joke\" falls completely flat and the entire \"plot\" was just as stupid as the last one. It's tedious watching this all the way through despite it only being little over 90 minutes. Baby superheroes... would you believe this has two direct-to-DVD sequels?

And although it isn't a masterpiece of awesomely awful film like THE ROOM is, I can honestly answer \"yes\". Just don't consider watching it alone and sober. The effects are terrible (and strangely disturbing in parts), the plot jumps all over the place while making very little sense, the dialogue is as bad as you'd expect, and most importantly Jon Voight gives one of the most bizarrely over-the-top performances ever. But I had a wonderful time laughing AT the film. The only genuinely positive thing I could say is that there were 1 or 2 moments that I thought maybe the laughs were intended by the film-makers, but they were few and far between. My suggestion? Get your mates, get some drinks, and have a Superbabies Drinking Game Night. Just drink whenever the character, Kahuna, is mentioned by name (it's a lot!).",

What can even be said about it, other than it has a couple of ideas in it which could have been, under very, VERY different circumstances, used in an interesting way? Jon Voight further proves that he should give up his Oscar (he puts on a completely fake German accent, and generally goes through the motions, which are humiliating ones), while the rest of the cast prove they should never get work again. Whoopi Goldberg makes a cameo--whether it's more embarrassing than her being in THEODORE REX or not would require me to see that film, and that's not bloody likely. The special effects are appallingly crude; the babies' lips, while digitally manipulated, still don't remotely sync up with the dialogue, but the dialogue is terrible anyway, so it's no great loss. Gregory Poppen's script is rambling and incoherent, and Bob Clark's (director of the aforementioned \"A Christmas Story\") direction is anonymous and spiritless. The child actors seem hardly to have been aware they were in a film at all, which is just as well; Skyler Shaye and Justin Chatwin play a teen couple, who are so dull as to have nothing worth saying about them. Deren Abram's production design fails by giving the Kahuna (the \"hero\") a secret lair which appears completely uncongenial to habitation, especially for children; it's a combination of THE NEVER-ENDING STORY and WILLY WONKA, but without charm or imagination. A spark of interest is raised when it is shown that the Kahuna pets and companions are almost all holograms; the loneliness of this situation could have been profitably used in a better film. But this is not that film, it is a dull, incoherent, crass, and intellectually offensive one. It's scarcely worth watching even for bad-movie lovers.",

DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT YOU ARE FAILING MISERABLY AT WHAT YOU DO???!!!!! watching this movie might make you think of a question to ask me. why would i watch this? why would i subject myself to pain and torture? because i am a movie critic and it is my job to warn you of how entirely detestable, abhorrent, heinous, and ungodly these kinds of movies are. i had to look up synonyms for bad things to describe my feelings. never watch this, please.",

Somehow my 4-year-old son obtained a VHS copy of this movie. Perhaps it was at a garage sale or something (if I find out it was a gift from one of my relatives they are getting a stern lecture!). Last night he really wanted to watch it with me before he went to bed. I remembered it being on RT's list of the worst reviewed movies of all time, so at least I knew what I was getting into. I've watched some stinkers in my day, and I can say with some certainty that Baby Geniuses 2 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. These talking babies are just damn creepy; its kind of like a luvs commercial on crack. Throughout the movie this leader baby pulls off wire-fu stunts, fighting bad dudes like a pint-sized Neo. Everything about this movie was lame. Jon Voight and Scott Baio (Charles In Charge) are going to burn in hell for this offense.

            "content": "In the beginning, it all just seemed like some beautiful, horrible dream...\n \nIt was nearly two years ago now that I first heard of the film that would become [i]Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2[/i].  You see, Access Hollywood was on right before Survivor (and still probably is, though I've mostly given up on Survivor since it started sucking so royally) and I'd gotten into the habit of watching it so my blood could get good and angried.  \"THAT'S NOT FRIGGING NEWS,\" I'd scream at Pat O'Brien, deaf to my pleading to stop, \"YOU SHOULD ALL BE SHOT AND KILLED!\"\n \nBut it was Access Hollywood that first brought me into the world of [i]Superbabies[/i].  They did a behind-the-scenes report on it, and interviewed star Scott Baio.  The next morning, I had to convince myself that it wasn't a dream.  Nobody would believe me that such a film could possibly exist.  \"Yeah, it's a sequel to [i]Baby Geniuses[/i], but this time the babies are superheroes, and Scott Baio's in it!\"  \n \nJust look at that last sentence.  It's crazy talk.  I'm amazed I wasn't locked up.\n \nThen, a good deal of time later, ads for Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 started appearing on billboards and on the sides of buses.  This was no dream.  This was real.  And it was coming to theaters no less, not dumped to video inconspicuously where nobody would notice a desperate Oscar-winning actor (Jon Voight), a one-time next-big-thing (Vanessa Angel) and TV's \"Chachie\" cavorting with infants made to look like they have superpowers thanks to bad CGI.  \n \nHow could such a thing be?  How could such a cinematic monster possibly exist, much less be foisted upon hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting moviegoers?\n \nTwo words: David Paul.\n \nThese two words may not mean anything to you, nor should they.  But David Paul is the producer of [i]Superbabies[/i].  He's also the producer of the original [i]Baby Geniuses[/i], Anthony Michael Hall's directorial debut[i] Hail Caesar[/i], the Paul Rodriguez vehicle [i]A Million to Juan[/i], and his own ego projects, including the intolerable [i]Slapstick of Another Kind[/i] (Jerry Lewis does sci-fi!) and the even more intolerable[i] Eternity[/i] (Jon Voight does... er, eternity!).  He got his \"start\" (after producing [i]Falling in Love Again[/i]) at 17 directing [i]Slapstick[/i], a film financed by his family.\n \nIn other words, David Paul comes from a very, very rich family that can afford to make horrible, horrible movies that nobody would ever, ever want to see and have them get released.  \n \nIn fact, he'd make a much better super-villain than Jon Voight in [i]Superbabies[/i], an incompetent German intent on taking over the world (probably) using hidden signals in an idiotic kid's TV program hosted by a poorly-made-up toad that he plans to introduce by showing it in the middle of a park, sponsored by a tiny day care center, run by Baio and Angel.  All of this is just plan nonsensical and stupid, and I haven't even mentioned the damn Superbabies yet.\n \nSee, Voight's brother is a kid named Kahuna, who took some secret formula designed by their father and now doesn't age (he's actually in his 70's, thought he looks 8) and has super powers, a secret chamber and lots of gadgets that do things that don't make a damn bit of sense.\n \nYes, Kahuna.  I don't know why either.  I guess kids today love references to surf movies of the '60s.\n \nSo the toddler son of Baio and Angel, along with three other kids at the day care that don't seem to have parents, teams up with Kahuna, who, thanks to his weird science gizmos, manages to give them superpowers.  There's Captain Courage, who is strong, Miss Cupid, who causes men to turn gay, Bouncing Boy, who makes DC Comics sue the filmmakers, and Brain Boy, who has the amazing ability to stand around and let other people kick bad guys in the crotch.\n \nWhile the talking babies aren't as horrifyingly creepy as that of the first film (and nowhere near the nightmare-inducing blasphemy-against-all-that-is-right that was the dancing baby of \"Ally McBeal\"), there's still no effort to make the kids look like they're even coming close the emotions expressed in their dialogue.  The \"gags\" basically consist of babies saying catch-phrases (only with the word \"diaper\" in there somewhere), though it's to the filmmaker's credit that there aren't that many poop and fart jokes.\n \nOf course, when that filmmaker is Bob Clark, the once-respected man behind [i]A Christmas Story, Black Christmas, Murder by Decree[/i] and [i]Deathdream[/i]... ugh.\n \nJust, ugh, Bob.  Ugh.  Still, I know you need a check.\n \nTo their credit, Baio and Angel only embarass themselves during the opening scene when they're forced to spew some awful expository dialogue.  They leave that up to Voight, who forces out a performance that makes his role in [i]Anaconda[/i] look restrained.  The kids... well, none of the kids will probably ever be seen again.  I mean, have you seen Jonathan Lipnicki lately?  What the hell is up with [i]him[/i]?\n \nSorry, getting distracted.  Watching [i]Superbabies[/i] has caused my brain to melt.  Needless to say, unless you're under 9 (in I.Q. points, not age) or an undiscriminating pedophile, there's no reason ever to expose yourself to this.  I knew about it, and that should have been enough for me, but noooooooo, I had to go prove that I could handle it.  \n \nI am [i]such[/i] an idiot.",
