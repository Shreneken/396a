            "content": "Am so disappointed with all of you tomato people. I think you don't even know anything about movies. This movie is so excellent and deserves to have a 96% ratting on RT let alone if the CGI had  better special effects supervisors this movie should score 100%. You rate the Wakanda Forever thing at 84%, a movie so horrible i couldn't even finish watching and then down play such beautifully well done pieces. Halle Berry a super hero girl is so brilliant in this movie that today she can play better than any super hero character you guys make lots of noise about. The power of Sharon Stone here makes this movie so fresh it seems like it was made yesterday. I can and am guessing even some of you guys can rewatch this 8% rated movie anytime and still enjoy it. Yes true the CGI was lucking abit but hey remember this was 2004, we are in 2023 incase you forgot. The stunts Berry pulls off here we cant even see in new movies today. The story was so natural, slow and well confined within the setting of a normal friendly neighborhood, not the multiverse fantasy crap of Marvel. This was just part 1 of the Cat Woman movie series and I believe director Pitof was going to pull off another epic cat woman part 2 movie just as James Cameron did in perfecting Terminator2 from what we saw in Terminator1. But the rush into criticizing this great movie may have caused the creators and actors of Cat Woman to get discouraged from giving us a better masterpiece in part2. My thought is that the Matrix 1999 movie special effects directors should have been put on this movie set, then we could have gotten ourselves an undisputed superhero movie. Apologies to Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and director Pitof for such outrageous, malicious and immature criticisms from undiscerning critics. Cat Woman 2004 is such a great movie at 96% Tomatometer.",

I was actually amazed while watching this movie at how bad it was. The writing, the story, the visual effects, and the tone are all a big mess. I will say this is one of those bad movies that is actually so bad it's really funny, so there's potential to watch it with friends and have a good time. However, on a technical level, it is a complete disaster in every way. Overall, it is an awful movie that is great for a bad movie night, but not really for anything else and anyone who is searching for one of the worst movies ever made should definitely check it out.",

Who cares if the science in the movie doesn't make sense? It's very fun. Catwoman is on a sexy power trip and Patience is along for the ride",

I really liked this movie they should of put a lot of effort in writing this movie i would still love to see it. NO WHERE NEAR MICHELLE PHIFFER......but its an amazing out side of DC universe movie it just had to be written better....though i would admit that the whole.... you were a cat in your former life new age hippy shit was lame LOL they could of found a better way",

It plays like a very poorly written and executed rough draft of a script.\n\tCatwoman is about a woman named Patience Phillips. Patience ends up coming between a line of hero and villain when she becomes Catwoman. She develops catlike characteristics after she's resurrected by a cat after she's drowned\n\t   Catwoman has actors who are good, nice looking actors Halle Berry and Benjamin Bratt and other relatively good-looking actors in it. One of the very alluring aspects of Catwoman is when we see what looks like a picture of Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. This makes us wonder if somehow Catwoman is set in the same universe as the film Batman Returns where Michelle Pfeiffer played Catwoman in. \n\tThere are so many flaws in Catwoman that it plays like a rough draft of a screenplay. The cop in the picture Tom Lone's last name has symbolism to it because he's a loner or vigilante. He's a policeman who doesn't like to have a partner and he likes to work alone. I however can't see analogy in the protagonist Patience Phillips name she seems to be more eager than patient. When she sees a cat on a roof, she's very eager to rescue it and doesn't really think about the consequences of saving it or how she could save it.\nI also would have liked if it really showed Tom Lone as a loner by not having him work with any other cops' period. The romantic relationship between Patience and Tom isn't very convincing. It comes across as if they should have a romantic relationship just because he saved her and, not because they have genuinely deep feelings for each other. Tom and Patience don't seem to really respect each other by deciding that they should have coffee together on a day when they both must go to work instead of deciding to have coffee together when they have time off from work. I would have liked it better if Lone had an authentically passionate relationship with both Patience Phillips and Catwoman. \n\tCatwoman plays like the 2002 version of Spiderman about a man who develops spider like characteristics after he's bitten by a radioactive spider, and Catwoman in Catwoman even climbs up walls like Spiderman. It also has some essentials of Basic Instinct. Tom wakes up with a scratch on his back after him and Patience make love a similar thing happens in Basic Instinct with the male lead having scratches on his back. Tom leaves Patience a letter after they make love and Catherine leaves Nick a note after they make love.\n\tCatwoman comes across as if it's a rough draft that borrowed or stole off everything else to be made.",

This movie isn't as bad as everybody says, it's just that audiences prefer more generic superhero movies with fart jokes and a happy ending, that why the MCU is so popular, but I appreciate the risk this movie takes, I mean nobody can tell me that changing Catwoman's costume to a stripper outfit was a safe choice. This movie was just as good as (or bad) as \"Jennifer's Body\" the only reason that, that movie didn't get as much hate is because \"Jennifer's Body\" isn't a comic movie like this one and fans are extra sensitive when it comes to this stuff. Something that this movie does amazingly well is make you feel empowered and sexy and a big reason for that is Klaus Badelt who did the music for this film.

Halle Berry being forced to rub catnip on her face... it just cracks me the hell up every time I see it. How can it not ? A actual human with a (questionable)brain actually wrote that in a script.

            "content": "You know how audiences dismiss DC's Extended Universe movies? Well, these kids have never seen arguably the most miraculously terrible and disappointing waste of opportunity that is Catwoman, an origin story which was supposed to be for the DC villain like what Joker did far better fifteen years later. However, this one features Patience Phillips (Halle Berry), a cosmetology graphics designer who gets killed in the sewers, brought back to life by cats, and discovers her new identity as Catwoman. However, the owners George and Laurel Hedare (Lambert Wilson and Sharon Stone), who discover Patience still alive, want to wipe her out from existence once again, label her as the villain, and launch their makeup that hardens skin. Unlike Joker where his progression toward evil, violence, and anarchy deemed believable, Catwoman's villainous motives aren't at all clear as throughout the film she utters insufferable cat puns, does all sorts of obvious cat-like behavior (i.e. eating canned tuna, sniffing catnip, making purring sounds, and landing on her feet), and dates the oblivious cop Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt). Speaking of, how can this guy not figure out that Patience is also the sexy feline heroine, even though her cursive handwritings, cat-like antics, and lipstick matches are so laughably obvious? Furthermore, the movie tries too hard to be visually diverse, using way too many composite shots, ugly motion capture movements, nauseating jump cuts, and glossy metal and brass tones. With Pitof's overabundance of style-over-substance nuance, the movie seems more like playing a Playstation 2 video game featuring one of those cube-like humanoids with triangle breasts and skimpy slutty outfits. Even as a retcon origin story about one of DC's best Batman villains, Catwoman is one heap of kitty litter worth scooping out and dumping in the bin. (1 White Russian [no ice, hold the vodka, hold the Kahlua] out of 5)",

This was a wonderful action movie with strong female lead that I recommend to anyone who likes that genre. Films w/strong female leads have a tough go of it, to begin with. Plus there's a general dislike of Halle Berry (envy?) by some. The weakest part of the movie is the casting of Benjamin Bratt. He was ineffectual as the detective love interest. His performance was flat, and the attraction between the two leads was anything but electrifying. Still, he wasn't terrible. It's just that a better choice could have been made.",

There's a bit of social commentary in here about the way women are treated in the beauty industry at a certain age or it could be about a women accepting her flaws and becoming free with herself.\nI'm not ashamed to admit I love Catwoman. For its runtime of nearly two hours I can safely argue I wanted more. \nThe film directed by French visual effects supervisor newcomer Pitof feels like a comic book come to live with its vivid colors and wild editing . Countless times we get insane CG crane shots of the beautiful Salt Lake City and the dark alleys Catwoman prowls .

I do not understand why Halle Berry wanted to do this movie, her reputation as a former Oscar winner cannot benefit from doing movies like Swordfish, Die Another Day, and this. I do understand why Halle Berry landed the role of the confident Catwoman clad in all black, but that is only half of the role. Berry flounders as her secret identity of Patience Phillips, who is a meek struggling graphic designer nerd shoved in a cubicle. The two-sided character of Catwoman could make for a complex hero and anti-hero, but heavy-handed storytelling ruins that too. The movie implies that there was a long line of women throughout the ages selected for a double life of power and freedom. The movie neglects to play up this interesting concept. How the main character earns that privilege, the transfer of that power, and how she learns about her new abilities fall short. These important plot elements are all lazy, flat, and shameless exposition. The overbearing soundtrack makes it seem like this is all a bad second-rate Destiny's Child music video. Scenes with her male love interest are particularly painful and feel like a daytime soap opera. Making the character scarf down fish, hating rain, and hissing at dogs is also too much, even for humorous relief. The villain role played by Sharon Stone is dull. She appears to be thinking manipulative corporate type of villain. She plans to release addictive cosmetics that slowly destroy people without continuing its use. Suddenly, in a plot hole the size of Texas, she reveals that the same toxic cosmetics made her superhuman and feel no pain. Poor decision-making by the director along with the Halle Berry's lack of acting range kill this movie. I will stick with Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman, thank you.",

            "content": "I watched Halle Berry's Catwoman before I watched Michelle Pfeiffer's, and I gotta say; Halle makes for one smokin' hot Catwoman. So I did not know of Catwoman's connection to Batman until after I saw Batman Returns a few years ago. I agree, that the film would've been better if they stuck to the Batman origins. But the acting was off in some scenes and Sharon Stone's character had a pathetic motive and was under-explored. The actors that were chosen for their respective roles weren't bad choices, but they still lacked in the acting-department. The plotline was weak, though Halle's fighting scenes were excellent. The beauty product that featured prominently was badly named and complete bullshit. Cosmetics companies must test their products for all types of side-effects before it becomes available to the public, cuz it's consumer-law, and usually it's an independent firm that does the testing. The product's name, Bea-u-line, doesn't roll of the tongue as easily as a cosmetics-giant would want it to, plus it's a terrible name, unimaginative. Patience' role as a graphic-designer/artist was under-explored, since she assumed the Catwoman identity quite early in the film. I like the way they used Egyptian folklore as Catwoman's origins, but this contradicts her real origins in Batman. The idea of Catwoman having ''cat-powers'' is lame, they could just easily describe her as a very flexible, agile and competent fighter, no special powers needed. Costume-wise, that cat-suit is glorious. Unlike Michelle's cat-suit in Batman, it depicts exactly what Catwoman (in general) is all about: Confidence, Seduction and Power. On the plus side for men, it provides us with a whole lotta eye-candy. The only reason why most men will watch this film is cuz of Halle Berry's moves in that cat-suit. People say that men are only after looks, that's true, but most of us also go for the personality, and let's not forget that women also go after the looks. And a confident woman (whether sexual or not) are very attractive to men. That cat-suit would make any race of woman look incredibly sexy, fortunately, Halle's skin was just the right tone to match the suit perrrrfectly. Her ''dance routine'' during the club-scene was well planned and well executed, her whip's movements was spectacularly well choreographed and nicely done. Halle Berry as Catwoman was brilliant in every way, but Halle Berry as Patience Phillips was anything but brilliant. Her romance with the cop could've been more romantic and her new dual-persona was unnecessary, she could've just ''acted nice'' as Patience instead of being nice, cuz that kinda spoiled the movie. Michelle's Catwoman is a proper vigilante, as she changes from a nice girl into a fierce woman with revenge on the brain and a badly stitched cat-suit. Patience only has revenge on her brain when she's in the suit. Michelle's acting was spot-on as both Selina Kyle and Catwoman. There was an unnecessary amount of CGI used in this film: Yes the cats giving Patience her powers was needed, but the CGI used on buildings that won't be destroyed like they do in Transformers, etc, was a complete waste of time and money. The kind of time and money they could've used on writing a better screenplay and doing better research for the film's plot. In short, this film has a ton of faults, major ones at that, but Halle Berry in that cat-suit is the sole reason why you would watch this film more than once, and she's the only reason why I liked the film. Halle Berry as Catwoman is simply too hot to ignore! I want to see Halle return as Catwoman, in the same suit, but as her Batman origins dictates. This will give her better credibility as the character, plus the backstory is much more interesting than in this stand-alone flick.",

She works as a graphic designer for Hedare Beauty, a mammoth cosmetics company on the verge of releasing a revolutionary anti-aging product. When Patience inadvertently happens upon a dark secret her employer (Sharon Stone) is hiding, she finds herself in the middle of a corporate conspiracy. What happens next changes Patience forever. In a mystical twist of fate, she is transformed into a woman with the strength, speed, agility and ultra-keen senses of a cat. With her newfound prowess and feline intuition, Patience becomes Catwoman, a sleek and stealthy creature balancing on the thin line between good and bad. Like any wildcat, she's dangerous, elusive and untamed. Her adventures are complicated by a burgeoning relationship with Tom Lone (Benjamin Pratt), a cop who has fallen for Patience but cannot shake his fascination with the mysterious Catwoman, who appears to be responsible for a string of crime sprees plaguing the city.\n\nCatwoman is not just one of the comic book movies ever made but it is one of the worst movies ever made.

Trust me, it is that bad.\n\nFirst of all, the story is just stupid beyond belief. Like Selina oops I meant Patience working at a cosmetics company? And how she becomes Catwoman is just ugh. At the end, I pretty much knew what was coming even though it was stupid. And speaking of her becoming Catwoman, when Patience becomes Catwoman, she wears this stripper-like costume that she could have wear in a strip club. I mean come on people, she look a stripper or hooker for that matter. It was dreadful beyond comprehension.\n\nThe effects are absolutely horrendous. They are some of the worst effects ever conceive. There is one part of the movie that Patience/Catwoman flies in the air and slides down the wall and oh my god I seen better effects on a computer game. Speaking of that, watching a computer game probably be more fun than watching Catwoman.\n\nThere is nothing to say about the acting. Everyone tried their best with this bad dialogue that the were given even Halle Berry. Speaking of Berry, this movie literally killed her career. She won a Acacemy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Monster's Ball. Berry is so much better than this. So is everyone else involve in this so-called production.\n\nWell folks, Catwoman is an utter pile of garbage that should have never existed in the first place. With the right people involve (like Tim Burton, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Nolan, and Anne Hathaway), it could have been a good movie but no like Hollywood fashion, a group new people got involve in this atrocity. It is a god-awful movie that no one should see even if you are a fan of the comics. Speaking of that did you know that the movie bombed? Anyways, avoid Catwoman like the plague and watch Pfeiffer as the character in Batman Returns and Anne Hathaway as the character in The Dark Knight Rises. Just pretend that this movie never existed like Berry did (which she stated that she hated being involve in this \"production\").",

            "content": "A spin off about Catwoman that would follow on from the heavily gothic Burton Batman sequel, or so we all thought. Everything seemed good to go, Pfeiffer was set to return and Burton was gonna direct, but like always in Hollywood things changed and a whole new group of people were brought in.\n\nThe plot? the plot is actually about makeup! indestructible makeup, yep that's right. In this film the villain is creating a makeup that inadvertently makes your skin as solid as rock, hence you are unable to feel pain or suffer injury. Drawback being if you stop using it it will scar your face up badly. So its up to errr...someone called Patience Phillips to save the day.\n\nOh the problems, so many! First up if you're expecting to see Gotham City forget it, this isn't Gotham. I'm not sure where it is actually but I don't believe its Gotham, its never mentioned as far as I'm aware. As we already know the character isn't Selina Kyle either, why? I dunno, so they take the opportunity to make Catwoman black with Halle Berry. Now I don't want delve too far into this issue but for me Catwoman is white, simple as that, yes I know Eartha Kitt has played her but still, essentially the character is white so why change that lore so dramatically?\n\nMoving on, the outfit, oh Jesus! what were they thinking. There really is nothing to say here other than its dreadful, purely dreadful, she doesn't look like Catwoman...a master thief/anti hero, she looks more like Catwoman...the sleazy hooker. The look merely consists of ripped (around the her ass strategically) black leather pants and a black leather bra...oh and the most stupid looking mask I've seen for some time, looks like its gonna fall off at any moment. It doesn't help that she has some hideous makeup work on her too, really nasty looking.\n\nThe film is chock full of terrible CGI, really bad looking stuff as Catwoman scurries up and down walls and acrobatically flips all over the show as if she were an insect, Spider-Woman. This leads me back to the plot idea here. The character is killed and changed into a 'cat woman' by some mystical feline that just happened to be there at the time. Why? not sure, the cat is owned by some good witch-like character, a spiritualist kinda person, apparently the cat chose Berry's character, the cat is a messenger of some Goddess or something. Still doesn't answer anything really.\n\nFrom here on our heroine develops cat-like super powers that enable her to crawl up and down walls, leap from massive heights, be well versed in martial arts and have cat-like hearing and sight....just like regular cats really. So we now know this film isn't about the DC comic book character, its actually about a completely different character that has nothing to do with the Batman universe, she's simply a cat woman, not Catwoman, but a cat woman. A woman who died, got resurrected by a mythical cat and was given cat-like super powers. Just happens to call herself Catwoman.\n\nI still don't really get why you would get all those abilities from being resurrected by a cat? do cats know martial arts? OK I'm being silly but seriously, why would you become a martial arts master?! becoming more agile and athletic sure but martial arts?? And do cats regularly climb up and down walls, across the ceiling and jump out of lofty buildings?? wut!??\n\nOf course there are so many problems with this disaster I can't even recall them all. Berry is kinda OK for the role but she is made to look and act like some kind of slutty diva/hooker. I mean really, the way she walks and carries on, its not sexy it embarrassing! I've never seen someone try so hard to be slinky and sexy...ever! Its really awkward to watch as she purrs and meows trying to raise the average male viewers temperature, its so cheesy, did she actually try to be Eartha Kitt?\n\nMind you Sharon Stone looks awful too, how much makeup?? geez! her haircut looks terrible and the fight sequence between her and Berry is laughable. She's an everyday executive for a makeup company yet when it comes to the crunch she can fight against a martial arts supremo? wow she kept some secrets then.\n\nAn utter shambles frankly, nothing to do with what you expect...in any aspect, virtually an independent film and character. Its a shame because I'm sure this could of been pretty neat with the right people involved, its just hard to believe what we see up on the screen got approved! I think the only thing I can be positive about is the final shot in the film where she walks off across the rooftops against a full moon. That is the only nice true comic book visual of the entire film, the end.",

            "content": "I really wanted to keep an open mind about this film. Even though a lot of people said this movie was complete waste of time, I still decided to watch it... and I must say right now it was a huge mistake. Catwoman is a mess from beginning to end. It's characters are flat, the story makes no sense, the acting is surprisingly terrible and I feel like a part of my Batman Fan Boy Spirit has died away. How bad is this film? Well let's start a little history of the REAL character of Catwoman. \r\n\r\nCatwoman was of course a villain/Anti-Hero in the Batman Comics. She always had a fan base, but it grew when everybody saw Michelle Pfeifer portray the character in the film \"Batman Returns\". Ever since then, fans really wanted a Catwoman movie with or without Batman. Well the film went into Development Hell for 12 years until we were given... THIS THING.\r\n\r\nTo start with, the story in this film makes no real sense. Yeah we have a character named Patience Philips (Halle Berry) who wants to be an artist. But she's stuck being an ad designer for beauty cream. Well when she finds out something isn't right with the new cream, she is considered a loose end and is immediately killed. Then she is resurrected as Catwoman. I have a major problem with this set up for two reasons. The first, this isn't the real Catwoman. I'm not just talking about the fact that this person isn't Selina Kyle, it was also completely unnecessary to give Catwoman SUPER POWERS. Really? Did Pitof or any of the writers know anything about Catwoman? They didn't watch Batman Returns or read any of the comics? Catwoman had skill, not Super Powers. The second issues is Patience herself is a total blank slate. Both before and after she becomes Catwoman, we have no idea who she is or why she is so special. Oh yeah, we get a lame explanation that she tried to save Midnight the cat from a ledge, but what else besides that? Where did she come from? Has she suffered any real tragedy? Does she have any family? Why was she chosen to become a Catwoman? By the way, this film has another throw away explanation on why there isn't a Selina Kyle in this movie. There has been more than one Catwoman throughout the ages and eras of time. This might've worked, but not in a film about a character so iconic that practically everybody knows her real identity. \r\n\r\nAlso, the writing and acting in this film is really awkward, unbalanced and just outright terrible. There are lines such as \"I always knew there was a spark between us\", \"Lassie would've brought me a key\" and \"Cat got your tongue\". Now, these lines might've worked in a different way or context, but somehow the writers managed to make these lines silly and stupid. Even the villain played by Sharon Stone has a plan that makes no sense involving the facial cream called Beau Line. I feel so stupid writing a review about a movie that has evil facial cream that can make your face either rot away or make it as hard as Charlie Sheen whenever he has a hooker in his closet.   \r\n\r\nEven though Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and Benjamin Bratt are trying their best with a script that is horribly written, their acting is really terrible. I guess everyone recalls that scene where Halle Berry sniffs the Cat Nip like a real cat? Yeah, I laugh every time I see that scene. Once in Awhile, Stone actually does well with her role. Not only is she trying her best with a horribly written role, but she's also trying to have fun with it as well. But still, a lot of time  the acting is really lack luster. \r\n\r\nThis film won 4 Razzie Awards (including Worst Picture)\r\nand I understand why. This film is beyond bad, it's one of the worst movies I ever seen. The acting is terrible, the story is not very drawn out or explained, the writing is idiotic and there is no real direction from Pitof. Before I end this review, I must address the costume that Halle Berry wears as Catwoman. Usually, I don't really care about the costume as long as the character is well developed. However, both components are really lacking for the major reason I mentioned earlier. Nobody, especially the writers and the director, cared about the real character of Catwoman. All these people saw was a hot, sexy woman with a whip. In reality, she was so much more than that. \r\n\r\nSelina Kyle had real power and strength, she didn't care what people thought of her or how she was viewed. She did her own thing because she wanted to live her life the way she wanted to. And how do these film makers portray her? They portray her as a dominatrix with an extreme cat fetish. That to me, is just out right insulting not only to the fans of the character, but to character herself.",
