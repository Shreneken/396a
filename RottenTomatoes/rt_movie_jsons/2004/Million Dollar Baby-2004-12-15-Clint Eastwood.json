    "summary": "Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a veteran Los Angeles boxing trainer who keeps almost everyone at arm's length, except his old friend and associate Eddie \"Scrap Iron\" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). When Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) arrives in Frankie's gym seeking his expertise, he is reluctant to train the young woman, a transplant from working-class Missouri. Eventually, he relents, and the two form a close bond that will irrevocably change them both.",

For good or bad, the ending will stay with you forever.",

            "content": "Warning: Spoilers\nI'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.\n\nMaybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.\n\nClint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.\n\nMillion Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.\n\nBoxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.\n\nI'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.\n\nTo use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life.\n\nIt all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank.\n\nMillion Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.\n\nI suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.\n\nThis film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby.",

I didn't expect 'Million Dollar Baby' to be so astonishingly brilliant.\n\nI've said it many a time before but for full context, I do not read up about films before watching them - aside from making sure the film isn't part of a franchise, checking the run time and seeing the genre - so I was expecting this to be a clich\u00e9-filled, but still great, sports flick. It's so much more than that.\n\nIt's way more deeper and has an everlasting impact that I hadn't anticipated. Even across the opening chunk I was predicating the obvious clich\u00e9 ending, but as the film progresses and, especially, as the final portion rolls around it just absorbed my total attention - I was fully engrossed... hook, line, and sinker. Some film!\n\nThe cast are simply stunning. Clint Eastwood gives an absolutely fantastic performance, Hilary Swank is truly sensational - especially at the end, damn - and Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman; what an actor and what a voice, using him as narrator was a great move. Elsewhere, and though less dramatically, Jay Baruchel, Anthony Mackie, Margo Martindale and Michael Pe\u00f1a also feature interestingly.\n\nIt's quite the journey the film takes you on, which I just found utterly enthralling to watch unfold. Perfect pacing, perfect acting. I loved watching every second of it and will undoubtedly be revisiting it.\n\nI noted days ago that I was rather surprised to learn that Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' had been so heavily acclaimed, on this occasion with this 2004 film I am the complete opposite. I don't care much for awards et al., but I am delighted to see all involved receive their props for this. Chapeau!\n\nMarvellous, just marvellous.",

It's all basically well balanced, in a way that it's easy to tell that everyone in the production team have had a good time. However, it actually feels like a mistake to call it a sports drama, as Million Dollar Baby is about so much more other than boxing. This is no Rocky. The main characters are so superb, so having some pathetic and rather silly side characters being over due in their mission to create a contrast to the story feels sometimes unnecessary. Nevertheless, Eastwood knows how to press the emotional buttons, particularly in the final, and anyone who has seen One Flew Over the Cockoo's Nest or Betty Blue 37*C, knows where he found the inspiration.",

Both Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank flawlessly outperform themselves here, Swank is an amazing physical actress who is able to show off her skills in every scene, regardless of whether or not she was boxing. As for Eastwood, this is actually my first time watching a Clint Eastwood film (acted or directed), and I can reliably say I'm entirely unsurprised as to how he gained his legendary reputation, which he lives up to 100%. My only problems with the film are the subplots (SPOILERS) involving Frankie's past, Danger, and the Gym, all of which remain unresolved, and left for the audience to figure out. The first of which, Frankie's past, seems like a rather important bit of information to leave out, especially since it looked like the movie was angling for it to be a plot point that Frankie would confront and grow past alongside his relationship with Maggie, but we get no such kind treatment. Alas, Million Dollar Baby is not a story about redemption, it's one of living life to the fullest, taking the shot while you still can, and the pain and loss one experiences from losing family. 4/5 for good story that could've been more coherent.",

The acting and writing are both beautifully understated, as is the subtly effective music score.

Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) wants to become one of the great welterweight contenders and recruits trainer Frankie (Clint Eastwood), who at first refuses but eventually has a change of heart, and his best friend Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). Similarly like Rocky, this is another one of those movies where the winner loses in the end, except Million's resolution is less balanced because Maggie gets paralyzed, has her leg amputated and begs for mercy killing. Also, this movie could easily have been sugar-coated with gender politics, with all the men in the gym being powerless over the female boxer. Instead, Eastwood takes a more liberal and realistic approach, focusing on Frankie's quest for redemption. While, yes, Maggie gets taken for granted and harassed by fellow gym members, her Ozark heart is part-iron, as she bites back with her slam comebacks. However, it's the ending that serves as the movie's saving grace. Frankie unplugs Maggie's respiratory machine and disappears into the diner, unable to return to his old profession anymore. Meanwhile, Scrap-Iron reminisces about Frankie's departure, holds his friend's torch at the gym and reads his daughter's letters. So, Million Dollar Baby isn't just a generic sports drama, it's a study of success and retirement. \n\n(4 Sleeping Socks with Holes on Them out of 5)",

Freeman narrates and his relationship with Eastwood is very believable as they both have lived through boxing all their lives and they still have little funny digs at each other. The boxing are fine, they are not the best boxing scenes ever filmed and watching Swank's character many fights in one round at times becomes boring. The last twenty minutes is where a lot of the emotion kicks in. Without boxing what is Swank's life, and what will Eastwood's character becomes the moral dilemma. Its quite a depressing end to the film, and i am not quite sure what it wanted to say. I didn't want or expect a Rocky ending. I am glad it didn't go an easy way but i don't think it fully worked.

            "content": "The mid-2000s were a particularly weird time for the Best Picture award with the trifecta of Million Dollar Baby in 2005, Crash in 2006 and The Departed in 2007, all three are decent if not incredible and it's emblematic of the poor cinematic offerings of the mid-to-late 2000s as a whole. The Departed (2006) and Million Dollar Baby are both very good films but neither of them are particularly interesting and in a better year they would have both been relegated to an outside chance nomination, although The Departed had the Scorsese advantage. I really like this film and I would definitely recommend that people watch it I just wish that 2004 had been a stronger year for cinema as a whole.\n\nMaggie, Hilary Swank, is a small town girl from the Ozarks in Missouri with dreams of making it big as a professional boxer. Before she can do that she needs to convince Frankie, Clint Eastwood, an elderly gym owner to train her. Frankie is ultimately convinced by , Morgan Freeman, and with his help Maggie quickly climbs the ranks becoming a bright new star on the female boxing scene. She has to contend with her rotten family headed by matriarch Margo Martindale while Frankie struggles to connect with his daughter via letter for reasons left to the imagination. Will they be able to overcome these problems in time for Maggie to triumph at her biggest fight yet? Spoiler alert: She becomes paralyzed after receiving a dirty hit from an opposing fighter and Frankie kills her upon request before making an ambiguous exit.\n\nThe film is definitely a tearjerker as crowd favorite Clint Eastwood suffers under the weight of having a close family member refuse to connect with him and seeing his surrogate daughter figure face seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The characters are well written though and our tears are earned as we see the hardworking underdog Maggie be shut down each time she rises up the ranks and as her relationship with Frankie grows closer there is a palpable connection felt between them. The dialogue used is very deliberate as Maggie is a \u00e2~hick' but an intelligent, worthy of respect young woman who treats those around her kindly. Eastwood doesn't say much but that's in line with how his character should be, a stern but loving paternal figure who suffers silently as his hopes are crushed. Having Morgan Freeman provide voice-over at many points doesn't hurt and his final lines in the final combined with the devastating finishing scene are heartrending. \n\nSwank who often cops a lot of flak for being a two-time Academy award winner is very good here as she plays the underdog very well with an edge of toughness too her character's warmth that pulls the film back from being saccharine sweet. Her openness and friendly demeanor are enough to let you believe the character is as lovely as the film wants you to believe she is and that makes her easy to root for in addition to strangling your heartstrings when she suffers. The pairing of herself and the understated, depressed Eastwood is wonderful as she makes him a happier person and he teaches her how to face the demons in her life before providing her with long lasting relief. She deserved recognition for this performance when considering how weak this year's Best Actress field was and a large amount of the film rests on her shoulders, fortunately she is able to handle that pressure. \n\nThis is a very good film with a star-studded cast, good direction and an emotionally affecting story. Out of all of the films they could have chosen I am glad they picked this because Eastwood and Swank are gold on screen together and the film engages it's audiences more than some previous Best Picture winners. No it's not an all-time great in terms of Best Picture winners like Gone With the Wind (1939) and It Happened One Night (1934) but it might be one of the strongest to come out of the 2000s decade and that's saying something about the workmanlike abilities of Clint Eastwood as an actor and a director. This is one to watch with lots of people around so as not to remain depressed after watching it but it makes you cheer and cry at once a unique feat for a film to achieve.",

            "content": "A Good Bold Deed.\n\nMillion Dollar Baby\n\nEastwood makes it look easy. It's as simple as that, over the years, watching him blend in, in all sorts of genre there never seems any doubt how much he adores the cinema. There is mutual love and respect, if there is sincerity in Eastwood's methods, the response is equally charming. Magnanimous is his vision and is exactly what he gets. But above all what fascinates me the most is how he reserves his persona on both on and off screen, I hardly remember yelling him ever on screen, Freeman had to jump in and point out, \"You think she can hear you from here?\" The answer is yes. She does; she may not follow it but she does.\n\nThe cathartic equation of this trio is the root of the film. With humor as slick as their body language- few lines from Baruchel doesn't fit in appropriately though- and flamboyancy on their rhythm that makes you scream for its awesomeness, it makes you want to warp back to your childhood days, never has someone loved something such unconditionally. It is for all the drama we crave for, we are not aware of where it can take us, but somehow we have been craving for it.\n\nThis has never been a sports genre for me, I couldn't care less about those knockout punches, I am waiting for Swank to go back to her corner and tangle more with Eastwood's vision. Haggis- the screenwriter- has written a complete script, swooping in all the drama or even humor- that you might think isn't essential to the storytelling- \"forming a circle\" gets a whole new definition. With an incredibly intense narration by Freeman, few poetic lines are the least bit of metaphor you are going to get, the real content is hidden beneath those questions that he keeps asking us; a smart move by the writer as it factors a lot on advancing the storytelling.\n\nAnd mind you, Freeman is not just a narrator, everyone gets one last shot (Eastwood gets Swank's dream and Swank gets her family) in this film and you cannot exclude him from it. Swank, the one that dares to dream, is confidently appealing on her terms, her bizarre fascination of ending a fight within first round, her petty questions and neglecting the orders constantly, is the window which she never lets go of.\n\nEastwood as her father figure grows more than that you can aspire for. Yes, it was anticipated that their chemistry would be the heart of the film but to extend this friendship on such a scale still melts me down; Mo Cuishle he calls her. The first training that he gives her where he snatches the punching bag and then shuts her down only to regret it later and give her that punching back again; that bit itself says a lot about the film. Call it a trash talk or flirt talk, their conversations are brimmed with humor that makes you weep hard than it makes you tickle, those moments are Million Dollar Baby.",

Besides directing, producing, and performing in \"Million Dollar Baby,\" Eastwood also did the music which was simply well-integrated and perfectly composed to match and quietly enhance the plot progression, the mood, and the reaction of the characters. This is a gutsy film, gritty in emotions. It can be a tear-jerker yet not at all sentimental. It tells it like it is - the down to earth hard living of boxing (the theme being a 'crutch'), while the crux of the story concentrates on three main characters (each with haunting past): Eastwood as Frank the weathered boxing trainer, Hilary Swank as Maggie the enthusiastic spark in this whirl of boxing energy, and Morgan Freeman as \"Scrap\" - besides being the voice-over narrator, provided the bridging catalyst as the cool and caring mainstay to both Frank and Maggie. There are sprinkles of wit and humor here and there - that's how life is: making up of laughter and smiles occasionally in the midst of challenges and struggles, joys and disappointments, hesitation and reinforcement of faith, plucking up courage to take that risk, and mishaps nevertheless happen. There is \"whose life is it anyway\" dilemma - the confrontation of death, to be or not to be.",

I know there have been boxing movies of male boxers dying and suffering terrible injuries, but this movie is really made at the dawn of women's boxing . The many people at the time who were aghast at the thought of women boxing , especially male boxing fans and press ,have now bought into it and women's boxing and boxers have shown they are as  relatively capable as their male counterparts. It has a bit if a dated and sexist outlook . The fragile flower outlook . The movie is undeniably well made ,but I think iit is maybe too manipulative. I for one hate the violence of boxing , but I believe in equality and this film while at first acknowledging that she could box , at this point I thought it was forward thinking ! Then to be put into a coma was to pull that rug and the final message was that women don't belong in the ring .",

            "content": "Million Dollar Baby is directed by Clint Eastwood, and it stars Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman in a boxing film about Maggie (Hilary Swank) that wants to be a boxer and wants to be trained by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), but he doesn't want to train her because he doesn't train girls. When he sucks it up, he'll help her for whatever he can for her to be at the top. I remember this being one of the films that I wanted to see for years, but there was no way that I could watch it unless I buy it, and I didn't want to because I don't know whether the film is good or not. All of a sudden however, I got to record the film from DirecTV when I saw it, and finally got the chance to watch it, and it lived up to the hype for me. Hilary Swank is terrific that I'm glad that she got the awards for her. Clint Eastwood does the scruffy voice as usual, but he's always good at it, and the direction by him is also great. Morgan Freeman plays his character a bit deeper than his usual characters which I like, and it's really unexpected to see Jay Baruchel in this, and seeing him play a person that's not bright, but not dumb, is different, and he does a great job at it that doesn't feel stereotypical. The characters are very developed that you enjoy them very much, and the writing by Paul Haggis understands about the main character not having a good enough job and is just willing to do anything to do what she dreams to do, while also flowing out from the other boxing films that makes this stand out and also not predictable, which I'm surprised to see that from an underdog story. It gives enough fight scenes that are entertaining to watch that's not boring, and the chemistry between Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood is funny, interesting, and very sweet that they really care about each other, and not in a relationship type. Now, let's get to the ending. I'm not going to spoil it, but let me just say, that it had a lot of controversy that some people didn't like that type of ending that it had, so for me, it's really hard to know whether it was the right choice or not, not film quality wise, but character decision per se. It's very effective no doubt, but it wasn't like messing with your emotional strings. So for me, it's not saying that you should agree to this ending, but you understand why they went with that, and it shows that they'll be consequences to it. In the end, Million Dollar Baby is honestly one of my favorite boxing movies and is up there with the greatest Rocky films.",

            "content": "Despite being as dramatic and emotionally powerful as the best of them, Million Dollar Baby is not your typical sports drama. There's plenty of elements of a Rocky style underdog story here, such as Maggie Fitzgerald coming from nothing to win everything against all odds, but the way writer Paul Haggis and director Clint Eastwood tell this story never makes it feel derivative in a genre full of familiar tropes. In fact, the film never truly has time to fall into standard sports drama territory: this is a very multi-faceted story that never focuses just on Fitzgerald's story, but interweaves multiple narratives and character progressions into one cohesive narrative. Fitzgerald, played by a charismatic Hilary Swank truly giving her all here, is, reluctantly, taken under the wing of Frankie Dunn, an uncooperative boxing trainer with a long history behind him. Dunn struggles with his own obstacles, largely rooted in struggles with religion alongside a growing paternal relationship with Fitzgerald, and Eastwood plays the character with a warm sense of heart behind his grizzled face. He has a friendly but occasionally strained relationship with a fellow employee at the boxing gym, Eddie \"Scrap-Iron\" Dupris. Morgan Freeman plays Scrap, and instills his familiar presence in a quiet that is both subtle and powerful. The film takes a strong right turn midway through the film, one that most sports dramas never find themselves delving into, and one that ultimately builds into a heart-breaking conclusion to the arcs of these three stories. What Eastwood has crafted is a stunning piece of film that stands as some of his finest work both in front of and behind the camera.",

When throwing a punch is survival for some, and some to win, and others but a dreamer.\nboxing is an unnatural act, it's backwards, we move our legs left and step into our feet & toes goes right, we move our legs right, step into into our feet & toes goes left. knowing how to stand, keep them legs under your shoulders. Make them feel it in your bones, only programmed to listen to you and no one else. learn to keep your balance and knock it off your opponent. Generate momentum of your right toe. flex your knees when firing a jab. fight back in up, so your opponent doesn't come after you. learn to breathe under pressure. the body knows what fighters dont, knowing how to protect itself. it takes over what you don't know and reacts on its own.  (knockout mechanism) And repeat.... born fighter.\nWe are in this ring of life, no breaking out of, naturally we are born into. Living with simple truths to what we know, and what it takes and what we have.... age, strength, money, knowledge. when we are not in the position to be fooled or provided false hope, only 100%. \n\nwhen your trainer knows whom is on top, the greatest contenders and only know if we are ready. Come all this way, for some to use you, take advantage of that skill, and opportunize. For others, it's more than that, breaking the trainer & fighter bond, when its all over when you have taught all there is to know about fighting, what more. When fighters are no different then other fighters, the technique passed down from one fighter to the next, all contained in a ring full of history of boxing. your trainer knows you, because he not only trained you the technique, but mentally and physically what your capable of doing. \n All fighters try to remain on the top, know everything, overcome anything in the ring and in life. Can't argue with a fighter without a grudge fight. Can go round to round, in control of their opponent and round you take. \ntrainers whom take a risk at you, but not entirely confident, to see what you are capable of. knowing your fighters determination above all is worth the risk. A trainer needs to protect its fighter, Concern for them, and provide for them when they can't do it alone. \nWhen there is not only rare hungry, barewood & bone fighters like yourself that are great fighters. \nWhen caring less about titles, wins, ranks when the next opponent is just fun curiosity to see what we lack or what good we are.\nSome risks we can't take back, if we fight, we make the risk on our own without burdening others. Some risks we better not take not for the loss in the ring, but loss in whom we want around in the ring. Being a fighter means you have a team of trainers behind you no matter what along the way, we protect ourselves other ways and ourselves. when no one understands who you are but your trainer and you. we try to escape thatblife, and try to help others too, but that life ain't for us all. We have changed with time, we are a league of our own after fighting the best elsewhere and improving on who we are. \nWhen intimidation and reputation and stories means nothing when your a more respectable fighter and able to beat them. when years of training doesn't beat the best training. 2 fighters both evenly matched don't want to return to that life they wished to escape, take the turn for the worst... \nWhen the trainer becomes the fighter for the fighter. When they are more than your fighter, but your own flesh, blood and bone.

No matter what other life we can provide for others, there is only 1 life that makes us truly alive, worth living, makes us truly part of this world.... if it's boxing then that was it. We fight ourselves, the burdens we carry are heavy enough that it kills us. We fight to overcome these burdens, redemption, new life, selflessness, and fulfillment of that void in our life. When the burden is too much and unbreakable more than anyone can imagine, we given in. How many defeats in our lives do we say enough is enough, time to hang it up.",

            "content": "I'm not sure how Million Dollar Baby managed to slip by me in 2004 when it was up for all those Oscars and even won Best Picture. I'm a fan of sports films, and usually enjoy seeing what the Academy is giving awards to, but somehow this one eluded me. I'm glad that I have now caught up on what I missed, because this movie is a real treat. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are absolutely amazing as the 2 gruff old guys who work in a boxing gym training all kinds of young fighters. However the real stand-out performance in this movie comes from Hilary Swank. She is so endearing as Maggie, that you can totally see how she gets under Eastwood's gruff exterior and into his heart. The conversations in this film are tonally perfect because it seems from the words that are being spoken that there is no emotion involved in any of these relationships, but because of the excellent performances you can sense the underlying affection each of the main characters has for one another. I did think that there were a few too many extraneous storylines that could have been jettisoned, so the movie probably could have come in under 2 hours. Jay Baruchel's role in particular felt extraneous, and sidetracked the story occasionally.\n\nOne thing I definitely have to applaud in Million Dollar Baby is how expertly they captured the boxing. The matches felt raw and real. Each punch was realistic and if I didn't know better I'd think I was watching footage from an actual match. The entire montage of Maggie bouncing from one match to the next was absolutely amazing, and I would have been happy if they had just continued down that path for the rest of the film. Of course the writers had other ideas, but I was totally on board for wherever this movie took me because I was fully invested in those 3 main characters. Eastwood and his director of photography also do a great job with the lighting and the use of color in most of the scenes. I really appreciated the visual style they used throughout and how they played with shadows and light in order to enhance certain scenes. Even the music sets the proper tone, and is utilized sparingly but effectively. I think if you haven't seen Million Dollar Baby, then it is one you might want to check out even if you're not a fan of boxing. The acting is stellar, and the action feels authentic. Plus the story takes you on a roller coaster of emotions that will stay with you for awhile after you're done watching.",

            "content": "After watching Million Dollar Baby I don't know whether or not to feel inspired or drained. Clint Eastwood is very good at making emotional screenplays and getting an audience engaged in a story. Million Dollar Baby is no exception. The story follows boxing coach Frankie Dunn (played by Clint Eastwood) who is one of the best coaches in the world of boxing. His coaching career changes forever when he meets a down on her luck woman named Maggie, who really just wants to fight and make a living. What this movie REALLY succeeds at doing is making you feel about the characters. Maggie is a character you just wanna hug. She is a fractured person for sure but that's what makes her so lovable. She's determined, inspired, feisty, and considerate. All these factors make a character feel human. Maybe that's why these characters are so well respected, because they act humane and not like actors playing characters. Frankie is another interesting character, while he's not the most huggable person in the movie, I still felt for him a lot. He seems gruff and kind of a crotchety old man on the surface, but I could visibly see his passion and feelings, and as a result makes a well rounded character. Morgan Freeman and Jay Baruchel were memorable side characters that I thought gave this movie definition. What I mean by that is that this movie found what it wants to establish itself as and that's an underdog story. Maggie is an underdog because of her past and no previous boxing experience. Frankie is an underdog due to training a woman in the ring when he's only trained men. Eddie got his butt kicked and ended his career and shows how he's determined to just go on in life and forget. I think that's a really good message in a film that you'd expect to be kinda grisly in the first place. The chemistry between Maggie and Frankie is unbearably amazing. While I was watching, I couldn't believe how well these two played off each other. Their dialogue during their arguments or pre-fight scenes were reminiscent of Mickey and Rocky. I really enjoyed the aspect of how Maggie felt like Frankie was the father she never had and Maggie was the daughter that Frankie felt disconnected from. The story, as stated before, is not something to be taken lightly. This film will emotionally drain you no matter who you are. The ending to this film will bring the strongest to tears because of how gutsy it is. When you think it gets bad at one part, next thing you know it gets worse and vise versa for when things begin to look up. I feel that Million Dollar Baby is a very well written film, it wraps everything in the end together to connecting it to key events throughout the runtime. This is the kind of movie that will have you standing up and cheering and then the next have you bawling your eyes out. This film is very well acted, well written, the dialogue is well written, the characters are humane, and the overall result is one heck of a boxing film. A-",

Quitting is not an option for Maggie when she believes it's her only chance to see a bright future ahead of her. Frankie eventually decides to train her. This movie also stars Morgan Freeman in a great supporting role as Frankie's best friend Eddie Dupris, a former fighter who Frankie trained.\n\nIt's, undoubtedly, an forgettable masterpiece and a great achievement in directing for Eastwood. The Oscar nominations and wins for this movie are well deserved and Morgan Freeman's narration in this movie is excellent and heartfelt - just the way it was in The Shawshank Redemption. The Oscar he won for Best Supporting Actor in this movie is well deserved and it's one of the best movies of his career. When I watched this I never heard of Hilary Swank before, but she played Maggie in a way that I could relate to because if I knew someone like her I'd pity her and look up to her, so Hilary definitely earned that Oscar she won. The last two out of the four Oscars it won was for Best Picture and Director - both for Eastwood. A genius whose brought a genius movie to life!",

It has a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a score of 86 on Metacritic, and it reached an 8.1/10 on IMDb. It was won numerous awards including Best Picture at the 77th Academy Awards. Clint Eastwood also won his second Best Director Oscar for this film, which was very much deserved, considering he directed, co-produced, and also played a major role in the movie as well.\n\tMillion Dollar Baby is a sports drama. It is about a girl named Maggie, played by Hilary Swank. She is a waitress in a small and run-down city in Missouri. Maggie aspires to be a boxer but when she shows up at an old gym in Los Angeles, she is let down when she asks the owner to train her. The gym owner, Frankie, played by Clint Eastwood, doesn't take long to answer her question; \"I don't train girls\". Even though she is the only woman in the gym, she continues to show up every day and train herself until someone helps her. After seeing her persistence and the way that she was embarrassing herself due to the little knowledge she had, Frankie agreed to teach her the basics of boxing until he could find her a manager. He finds her a manager and she is set for her first fight. During the fight, Maggie is not doing so well and Frankie takes the new manager's place and coaches her through the fight instead. After being persuaded by his friend Scrap, played by Morgan Freeman, and after spending time watching Maggie in the ring, Frankie realizes she is a natural and that he wants to work with her. Frankie had a rough past with his own daughter, and he feels he could build a father-daughter bond with Maggie. Maggie's own family isn't very caring and doesn't show her much support so she gladly builds a relationship with Frankie. Frankie sets up a very important fight for Maggie, even though he is very protective of her at this point and has been reluctant to let her fight. The fight is in Las Vegas against the WBA champion. Maggie is doing well in the fight when all of a sudden she gets knocked out and falls on the stool in the corner of the ring, breaking her neck. This leaves a very bad outlook for the rest of her career. When she tries to call her family, no one ever answers. Finally one day they show up to the hospital to see her on their way back from Disneyland. They also have a lawyer with them to try and get Maggie to sign all of her money over to them. Maggie orders them to leave. It is at this moment when she realizes how much Frankie cares about her. \n\tThe movie has a dark setting. The gym, the place Maggie works, and the hospital are all dark and gloomy. This is to enhance that it is in a run-down part of town, and it is not meant to be a cheerful movie. The volume of the movie is very dim compared to other movies. When Frankie talks, you have to turn the volume up just to understand him. This gives more of a dark and sad effect also. Throughout the movie, Morgan Freeman is also narrating. Any movie that involves Morgan Freeman is automatically a must-see. Morgan Freeman was perfect for this role because his smooth and slow voice helps to set the gloomy tone for the movie. \n\tThe main theme of this movie is if you try hard enough and if you don't give up on something, even though others are criticizing and laughing at you, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. Maggie came from a small and poor city and her family didn't believe in her because of their own confidence issues, and she still managed to get herself out there and was persistent and diligent when it came to getting what she wanted. Frankie went through his whole life being depressed and guilty about his daughter that he never got to know, and this made him not want to train girls or build any relationship with a young girl. But once he took the chance, it was the best thing for him and Maggie cheered him up constantly and she made him very proud of her accomplishments, just as a father would be.",

Clint Eastwood in my opinion gives the best performance of his career in the movie. He gives a very stern, but emotional performance in the film especially towards the end of the movie where you just see his performance pour out of him. I've never seen Eastwood cry before in a movie, so when I saw this movie and towards the end of the movie where he opens up to the priest in the film about Hilary Swank, I had never been so shocked by a performance by him before and he usually plays the tough guy roles that he is know for like \"Dirty Harry\" and \"Gran Torino.\" But in this movie he gives a very human performance in the movie, definitely making him worthy of the best actor nomination that year for the movie. But it's his keen eye directing that makes his performance and the movie work so well. Hilary Swank also steps up to the plate with Eastwood and also gives in my opinion the best performance of her career in the movie. I knew as soon as I saw the movie she was gonna win best actress that year at the oscars. She so good you can't take your eyes off her as you root for the entire movie. And also for Morgan Freeman, who has screen legend written all over him, gives an awesome supporting performance in the film as Eastwood's longest and closest boxing friend in the film, who he trained and managed him in a fight years ago when Freeman and Eastwood were young men and Freeman was I. His prime as a boxer before losing his eye in a boxing match for getting hit too hard. The whole film is compelling to watch until it gets to the end with Swank's character as the movie becomes very emotional to sit through and watch. It's the final act that earned the movie it's Best Picture win and Best Director for Clint Eastwood who deserved the award without a doubt that year. I definitely rank this as one of the best boxing movies of all time even though it's from a woman's perspective but who cares, the movie is pure magic all the way through the end; and I don't say that about a lot of movies.",

Morgan Freeman is so good here narrating the story,  and offering inspirational words throughout the movie.  He also lives in the gym that Eastwood runs so they are good buddies. An excellent tale of determination that is inspring, yet very sad at the same time. An emotional roller coaster that has a big effect on the viewer.",

These thoughts disappeared almost instantly and this is because I could just sit back and watch a film made by people who love the industry and people who know what they are doing. You watch a film with any of the three main stars of this movie and nine time out of ten it'll be something worth watching, ignoring the fact that Freeman is in pretty much everything these days. The film might be about boxing but the thing that is more important and trumps everything else is the human story at the centre of it, this movie is about the characters and those are the kind of movies that are the best to me. So, naturally, the acting is excellent from everyone from the three big hitters to the little side stories involving Maggie's mother and the always energetic Danger Barch, everything matters and everything is interesting and every story has a great conclusion. The ending was so shocking and, to talk about it in detail without having seen the movie is a crime of the highest calibre so I will try to be vague, everything  just changed so fast and I thought it was out of place at first and I was expecting everything to get back to normal again! But no, its an unconventional story but a good story made for the right reasons. It was quite strange at first that the big fight was about an hour and a half into the movie, but that just shows you how original it is. I could talk about it for ages but just watch the movie, you're doing yourself a disservice by not. Incredibly touching, extremely powerful and utterly unforgettable. Perfection.",

He brings a strong and emotional story about a young woman trying to make her dream of becoming a boxer come true. Normally not my cup of tea, but I found it to be extremely powerful. This film ran more than half a year in the American movie theaters. Next to Eastwood, we see Morgan Freeman (Seven). But I have a huge respect for the amazing performance of Hillary Swank (Boys Don't Cry). A must see piece of art. \n\n After losing his prize winning prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to a successful manager, grumpy old boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is approached by waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) to train her. Telling her he doesn't train girls, she doesn't stop coming over to the gym that Frankie runs with the help from 'Scrap' (Freeman), who encourages her. Eventually Frankie agrees to teach her some tricks. Maggie turns out to be a very talented and hard training woman. Being estranged from his own daughter, Frankie develops a bond with her and arranges her first boxing fight. It doesn't take long before she becomes a professional and they travel to Europe where she keeps on winning. With the prize money she wants to buy her white trash family (who are living in a trailer park) a real house.

Having problems with his own daughter, he sort of develops a new father/daughter relationship with her. He helps her from her small fights all the way up to her bigger fights until she gets sucker punched and gets injured. Her life quickly deteriorates since she is entirely bed-ridden and has to live a machine assisted life. I can agree with some of the criticisms that she wins in such an odd way of always knocking her opponents out. Also, her final opponent would have been disqualified long before the sucker punch for her actions. Besides those things, I enjoyed this.

I remember seeing this movie when I was 12 with my parents and I don't think I liked it then because I was too young to understand it. My parents covered my eyes through most of it because of the violent fighting scenes. Million Dollar Baby is about a struggling woman, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) who has one big passion, to be a female boxer. She asks Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), a boxing trainer to train her. At first he refuses and won't take her seriously because she is a woman and he doesn't believe that boxing is a sport suitable for women. Eventually he reluctantly decides to train her. Maggie is also helped along the way by retired boxer Eddie \"Scrap Iron\" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who also narrates the story. Maggie becomes extremely successful and her career climbs great heights, but is her career in boxing ill-fated?\r\n\r\nThe leads were powerful and strong; Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman were phenomenal. Clint Eastwood is a very talented man, not only did he act in the film, he also directed it. This film is also quite unique in that female boxing isn't really that popular and boxing films are usually about men in the ring, not women. This film is quite dark and harrowing and has a lot of violent and blood, so if you don't like dark and depressing films with lots of violence this probably isn't for you. I have to admit myself that I found that film a bit too dark, but it was very moving with outstanding performances from the cast. I like how the film tells us about Maggie's life and background; her primitive hillbilly family are un-supportive and only want Maggie's money. This is a really powerful drama, though don't see it if you're feeling low.\r\n\r\nGrade: A-/B+",

Morgan Freeman relives 'Shawshank Redemption' and offers his distinct soothing voice for narration as well as serving as a great supporting actor in his role as an partly blind retired boxer. This reflects his better days before he made the switch to assassin/old smug pimp roles (i.e. 'Wanted' and 'Now you see Me'). Hilary Swank could not have done much better as the confident main protagonist; definitely worthy of her Academy Award and Golden Globe. Most notably however is the powerful ending.

While this isn't necessarily a criticism, MILLION DOLLAR BABY walks a fine line between emotionally powerful drama and sappy, overly sentimental melodrama. Fortunately despite the predictable plotting and cliche dialogue, it has a trio of excellent performances that keep it out of the kitchen sink. Front and center is Hilary Swank as Maggie, a down-on-her-luck waitress who aspires to be a boxer. Her performance is what really makes the film work due to her irrepressible spirit and down-home charm. Clint Eastwood also does an admirable job as Frankie Dunn, who reluctantly (\"I don't train girls\") takes a role as Maggie's trainer, manager, and mentor. And then there's Morgan Freeman, one of Frankie's former fighters, and who also co-runs a gym with him. I will admit that his presence in the film adds some depth as he is a connection to Frankie's past, but I didn't feel like he was integral to the story. Still, he had one of the film's best scenes when he shows that despite losing an eye (and being old), that he still has \"it\" in the ring. Beyond these three central performances, the film seems content to stick to the tired sports movie formula of having a older mentor train a younger up-and-comer, at least for the first 3/4. Despite the film having been out now for over 10 years, I still won't give away the sharp turn the story takes. At that point the film becomes something else which is more obviously heavy-handed and didn't quite work for me. It also doesn't help that the film strongly hints at the outcome very early on, robbing it of a lot of the emotional impact. And that is actually my biggest problem with the film. Not content to let the performances and story stand on their own, Paul Haggis (a producer/co-writer) insists on holding the audience's hand throughout the entire film. It didn't work for me in CRASH, and didn't really work for me here either. Still, Clint Eastwood manages to elevate the material to the point where I didn't hate myself for watching it. Overall, the three central performances are enough to loosely recommend this film, but just be aware that it is somewhat heavy-handed and relies a little too much on genre cliches.",

            "content": "Tenacity is an inspirational quality found in an individual, refusing to back down when everyone else disapproves and or refuses to believe in you, is one of the most admirable qualities a person can have. However, because of obligatory Hollywood clich\u00e9s, tenacity usually makes one's eyes role because of the oversaturation of films that deal with that specific quality people. Nearly every protagonist endures through their struggles and eventually is rewarded with success, getting the girl, ect. Yet that unfortunately is exactly why tenacity is viewed as a preachy clich\u00e9, because filmmakers show, that it is guaranteed, that a happily ever after ending will be treated with never giving up. Sadly that is not how the world works which is indeed powerful yet honest for Clint Eastwood's, \"Million Dollar Baby\", bravely transcends its surface clich\u00e9s of a woman refusing to give into her determined role In society, by instead reminding us that achieving our goals is ultimately all that is worth living for, our purpose in life; and that after fighting our way into this world we can only fight our way out by accomplishing our dreams. The thematic richness of this film is honestly staggering considering its conventional concept of a boxer training to become the best, for the film is largely about taking chances and embracing our own character. All of this is due to the brilliance of director, producer and actor Clint Eastwood. Because Eastwood was responsible for committing a powerful performance and beautiful direction, one of those aspects of the film would be weaker than the other which is 100% not the case for his direction is always wondrous. Despite the feminine quality of the word, Eastwood's framing and cinematography were utterly beautiful with the darkness of the surroundings always being purged by a beam of light from the window, which not only succeeds thematically but also visually. Ask any boxing director and they will always tell you that successfully blocking a boxing match between two actors is always incredibly difficult due to the inability for the actors to actually hit one another, yet no scene in the film is exposed in this area either because of the skill of Clint Eastwood's direction or Hillary Swank's skill; overall immaculate direction from Eastwood. Paul Haggis's screenplay is also powerful in delivering strong dialogue exchanges between characters but also wondrous thematic touches throughout the film. The only weak area of the script is within the pacing which does drag occasionally, yet never enough to damage the film significantly; overall a very well done screenplay from Haggis. Undoubtedly the best aspect of Million Dollar Baby is the amazing trio of actors that honest to god truly becomes their characters in the film. Clint Eastwood is troubled elderly boxing trainer whom grows tremendously throughout the film, Hillary Swank an aspiring young boxer filled with tenacious spunk and Morgan Freeman is a retired boxer who still is unwilling to leave Frankie's side. All of the actors exchange beautifully with one another and are certainly the best parts of the film. Common phrases accompanied with this film are beautiful, thematically rich and tenacious; Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is all of those and so much more for the film is beautifully rich in heartbreaking performances, brilliant direction, immaculate writing and is certainly one of the best films of the past decade certainly deserving its four Academy Awards of Best Picture, Director, Actress and Supporting Actor.",

Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman give the greatest performances of their careers in this boxing drama that is one of 2004's greatest films. Eastwood doesn't just make this better than his 2003 film, Mystic River, he puts this one up with his 1992 Oscar-winning Picture, Unforgiven. \n\nEastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a boxing trainer who had his whole life in the ring and writes letters to his daughter, who just returns them and just lost his greatest boxer. One day, a woman named Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a waitress who wants a trainer to help her with boxing. Frankie won't help her because he says, \"I don't train girls\". Maggie shows up to Frankie's gym and works hard to make boxing the most meaningful part of her life. Frankie thinks she will be weak because she lacks experience, she is too old at 31, and he never thinks about women boxing. Maggie then finally wins Frankie's respect, and he decides to train her which leads to a new relationship between them. Morgan Freeman plays Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris, Dunn's best friend and assistant in the gym who also helps Maggie.\n\nFeaturing a wonderful script by Paul Haggis, who adapted from a short story from F.X. Toole, Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner, Million Dollar Baby proves to be another Eastwood masterpiece! Hilary Swank gives one of her greatest perfomances since Boys Don't Cry. Morgan Freeman gives his best performance since his 1994 classic, The Shawshank Redemption, but even better. Clint Eastwood produces and directs this movie like Unforgiven. Million Dollar Baby is a marvelous movie that Eastwood fans will love for generations!",

But looking at it through objective eyes, I can see why the Academy salivated over this. They love the pseudo-true story with a lesson genre, and having a great cast doesn't hurt your chances at all. In the end, I felt disappointed and sad, not because the movie was bad, but because the whole feel of the movie just brought me down to earth, just like the main character. So much promise, yet we end up with hurt and disappointment. I've never been one to shy away from a less than happy ending, but in this instance, I was definitely rooting for a ride off into the sunset. That being said, the performances were what you'd expect from such a talented cast. Even Jay Baruchel, who was relatively unknown at the time, managed to make me tear up a little. All in all, a tragic movie that is unapologetic with its cruel and harsh message. Make some time in your week to watch this. 8/10",

It's not my favourite boxing movie but its far from a bad one.\r\n\r\nThe Morgan Freeman voiceover technique is brought out again for this one and the script is good enough that that works despite being overused as hell. The performances are good- Swank is excellent, Freeman is good and Eastwood is himself (what I can say? I like the movies but the acting does little for me.)\r\n\r\nIts a pretty simple movie and I think that's where the emotion lies in it- if this attempted to be flashy and epic then it would fail but this one knows to keep it with the story. That's where the strength of the film is and the 2+ hours fly by because of it.\r\n\r\nIts still a bit quiet for my liking though, maybe too much of the butterfly and not enough of the bee. (I HATE MYSELF) Even though the approach grates on me a little, it only makes the film more ambitious and more of a success for pulling it all off.\r\n\r\nWhile it tells a good story, the story doesn't seem to mean anything and its a real failing here- we have a real underdog story that isn't converted into more- its not about overcoming prejudice, its not about realising who you are, its not even about boxing after a while. It ends up feeling like a bit of an ego-trip in that way, it ends up being more about Eastwood showing that he could make another good movie as opposed to it being about making the best movie possible.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Dunn is so prevalent in the film and yet, to me anyway, is so unappealing is another fault. Some elements are so overdone also- the family is just annoyingly bad, we get the idea and its hammered in far too heavy, one scene was almost laughable because of it. These things along with all of the clich\u00e9s ruin some of the genuineness and makes it difficult for this one to live up to the hype for me. \r\n\r\nStill, films are about telling stories and this one is well put together and well delivered and it manages to have its own character within a pretty restricted genre. A good film but not the best by anyone involved.",

Her coach reluctantly takes her under his wing and teaches her what she needs to become an exceptional boxer. \nIt was a good start, getting our hopes up and making Maggie a star. What was not preferable is that Maggie has a large amount of matches, but many are not shown for very long or not at all. It is just shown that she wins but does not give us the full story.\nWhen Maggie makes it up to her final match, she gets paralyzed from the neck down and is from then on living her life in a home. After much protest, Frankie finally cooperates with Maggie -- and mercy-kills her because she hates living life that way.\nThe acting was superb, however the story was missing certain aspects.",

Before the chain of the plot twist, this may not be known to Eastwood but he'd directed a good suggestion of what direction the \"Rocky\" sequels would've went to at the same successful level of the 1976 Best Picture winner, when there were few similar points. As the film processes, it'd went from an A- to a B-movie, with good cast and performances. (B+)\n\n(Full review coming soon)",

Clint's voice and face was too gruff for his character, or perhaps his character wasn't gruff enough for his face, whatever it was - something didn't add up about this guy. Morgan Freeman was in this movie so they could have a good voice over guy. His role was pretty much the old guy who hangs around and says wise things (even though he clearly didn't have a grip on his own affairs). Swank made this movie for me. Perhaps it is because I know almost nothing about boxing that I totally believed her physicality, I would not be surprised if you  told me she was a real boxer. She was the only true character in this for me, except maybe her 315 pound mum - who I loved to hate.\n\nIts a kind of clumsy movie, not efficiently getting the necessary things done. However, the story is very nice and of course it is beautifully and subtly shot. Not a masterpiece, but a well made tragic sporting movie, with Swank pulling out an amazing performance.",

Boxing movies are always, ALWAYS about people who come from nowhere and are seen by their peers and family as never amounting to anything in their lives, overcoming the odds against them to be successful. This movie was on its way to being that typical boxing flick until an unexpected moment changes everything and, as a result, I think set this movie apart from many of the others in its genre. I guess a key difference between this story and a lot of the others is also the fact that this was is not based on actual events and the others are. \n\nBut Million Dollar Baby is unflinching in its portrayal of the brutality of the sport. One scene, in which Maggie gets her nose broken in a fight and has Frankie \"fix it\", almost made me freakin' vomit. There's really good acting here from Swank and Eastwood. Clint doesn't \"scowl and growl\" as much as he usually does in this one. I liked Jay Baruchel as Danger, but the goofy Southern accent had to go. Also, if I see Morgan Freeman as the token negro character one more time I'm gonna scream. He's always THAT guy, lol.",
