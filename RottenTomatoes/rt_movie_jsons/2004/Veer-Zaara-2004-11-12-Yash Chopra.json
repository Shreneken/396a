            "content": "What is the meaning of loving a film? I really don't know. But yes. I do know from the bottom of my heart that Veer-Zaara is an absolute masterpiece.\n\nThis film has everything. And everything comes beautifully in its perfect place due to the influence of the powerful man behind the camera, Yash Chopra. How can one man pull off such masterclass in storytelling that even though the concept and the story being so cliche feels so fresh and unique? You will always be missed sir.\n\nFirst off, SRK and Preity Zinta are just magnificent in the film. There is no second guessing there. the story of Veer Pratap Singh leaving his entire life behind to protect the honour of Zaara Hayaaat Khan is supposed to be an emotional rollercoaster and both of them don't miss a beat. I can't not believe that there is a man alive who can love Zaara more than Veer and it is all due to the performances of these two actors. truly exceptional work by both of them. the rest of the cast also is simply great. although most of the screentime is given to the leads, amitabh bachchan, hema malini, manoj bajpayee, rani mukerji, boman irani, all of them do a great job to support the love story perfectly.\n\nthe music is also really good. an album so good it will make you wanna cry, dance, be happy and fill you with all emotions humanly possible.\n\nidk about you guys but, this film is perfect for me. a story I will never forget and cry everytime I rewatch it.",

Its a magically heart delt romance between two lovers which transcends the overall politics. However, Rani Mukherjee as the law practitioner and defense lawyer fighting her first case against her own ideal is the heart of the film, and she does everything she can to be technical indore the court room and still anek space for some emotional heeft and melodrama that doesn't, for the first time, feel sappy. Its a good and layered romantic and my favourite film of the year.",

            "content": "Veer Zaara is an epic love story set in the contemporary context of the continuing enmity between India and Pakistan. It stars three famous actors, Shahrukh Khan, Preity Zinta, and Rani Mukherjee, along with Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini in supporting roles. The film begins with Veer in a jail cell in Lahore, known only as Prisoner 786. He has been in jail for 22 years and in the first half of the film we learn why. He fell in love with Zaara, a Pakistani woman, during a trip to India she made to immerse the ashes of her Sikh nanny. Veer followed Zaara back to Pakistan, but was arrested on a trumped-up charge of being a spy.\n\nThis is the film's framing, but most of it is a love story that talks about the power of true love. The songs are romantic and intense, showing the kind of love that overpowers the individual, almost like a haunting. It also shows the importance of thinking of community --here Punjabiness-- across national borders. The dialogue, the songs and the imagery are all invested in thinking about Punjabiness beyond the India-Pakistan boundary. As Saba Bhaumik writes, although war films are not very common in Bollywood, recent films especially during the Kargil War in 1999 tended to vilify Pakistan (Bhaumik, \"Politics of Indian War Films\"). Veer Zaara, along with Main Hoon Na, also released the same year, take a different path.\n\nThis is an epic romance similar to Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, which also shows a self-destructive love that overpowers the two lovers to such an extent that you wonder whether they can have a future. It is also similar to Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, which also stars Shah Rukh Khan, and talks about the kind of love that is worth waiting for. DDLJ also has an idealized image of Punjab, but in that film, it is Baldev's nostalgia image of Punjab that actually leads him to make the wrong decision for his daughter, whereas here the image of a lush and fertile Punjab inspires the audience to think about the commonality between people on both side of the border.",

The story takes place in India and Pakistan, in the early 2000s. It's about a star-crossed love affair beetwen two opposite being. The movie tells the story of Zaara Hayaat Khan a Pakistani who comes to India to scatter the ashes of her childminder and Veer Pratap a pilot and officer in the Indian Air Force. One day Veer rescued Zaara and tooke her to her village where she met Veer's uncle and aunt who took care of the young lady. Veer found himself falling for Zaara. When she came back home, Zaara's family gave her hand in marriage to a verry importante but crual man, but she was already in love with Veer , she couldn't stop thinking about him so she decided to inform her parents about her feelings. Unfortunately they weren't able to understand her, with the help of her bestfriend, Zaara will see Veer, but it will end bad, Zaara get married and Veer winds up in jail. Zaara got divorced and went to Veer's village, she believed the love of her life was dead. After many years in jail Saamiya Siddiqui a young lawyer decided to take care of his case... The decors and costume set the viwers in a world full of magic, a colorfull and fasinating univer. The lightning game show to the viwers the intensity of the action: all the \"bad\" moments are almost dark  and the \"happy\" ones are lightnig. The colors and the musical aspect of the film and the fact that two opposite culture merge give to the viwers a desire to see more. The twist and emotion of the movie get the viewer swept away. In my opinion, i can't give any negative point, i love everythings from the begining to the very end. This Bollywood is a most see, one of the most beautiful romance movie i ever seen in my whole life!",

The story......an Indian guy spending 22years in Pakistani prison safeguarding his beloved's pride while his beloved(a Pakistani who thinks that his love has died) is back in India fulfilling his beloved dream of a modern village...is super EPIC.....this is the most ROMANTIC and Dramatic plot ever....\n\n5/5 star from my side..but if I keep western world's taste in my mind its 4.25/5",

Great music! The plot is excellent and the writing was precise. Each actor brought their character to life in vivid detail. A fascinating film that uses a love story as a commentary on the relationship between India and Pakistan. Veer is an Indian prisoner in a Pakistani prison. However, a young female lawyer has decided to fight for his freedom and as she regularly visits him in his cell, he tells her the story of how he became a prisoner. It seems it all started because of his strange encounter with a Pakistani girl named Zaara twenty years before. The story is quite captivating and the characters engaging. The musical numbers are quite delightful and in a few instances quite inventive. It could be argued that the film is a bit on the predictable side but that's hardly a fault in the long run. Certainly worth a look. Veer-Zaara is so arresting, its scenes so full of beauty and colors, that the three hours go by almost too fast.  Though Chopra's film is emotionally extravagant even by the standards of India's epically unrestrained cinema, the star-crossed lovers bear the weighty metaphorical significance of their travails surprise. outstanding. loved it.",

            "content": "\"Veer-Zaara\" is an epic love story, one which transcends borders real and imagined, and the message that true, abiding love will eventually overcome all obstacles is powerfully presented here. The story begins in Lahore, Pakistan where an idealistic young female lawyer, Saamiya Siddique (Rani Mukherjee) seeks her late father's blessings (at his grave) as she prepares to take on her first human rights case, that involving the unjust long-term imprisonment of an Indian national, Veer Pratap Singh (played by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan). Veer was accused over 20 years ago of being an Indian spy, Rathod, and was found guilty and imprisoned ever since.\n\nAs Saamiya eventually draws Veer out of his self-imposed silence, she learns about the love story that has inspired this silence - one which takes viewers via flashback to 22 years earlier. Viewers are introduced to a young Pakistani Muslim girl, Zaara (the ever gorgeous, dimpled Preity Zinta) , the only child of a wealthy and influential Pakistani politician, who agrees to take back the ashes of her Punjabi nanny, Bebe, back to Bebe's native Sikritpur in India. Although I did question the credibility of such an important man allowing his only precious daughter to make a solo journey across the border, well, I'm willing to suspend disbelief here.\n\nZaara does make the trip and along the way, the bus she's traveling on has an accident, and she is rescued by dashing Indian Air Force Pilot, Veer Pratap Singh (SRK). The pair hit it off immediately, and not only does Veer help Zaara fulfill her nanny's last wishes, but also persuades her to visit his native village for one day, so that they may experience the Lodi Festival together. At the village, Zaara meets Veer's uncle and aunt (whom he considers his parents), played by Bollywood icons, Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini (who despite her years, always looks gorgeous and graceful). It is also here, that Veer realizes he has fallen deeply and irrevocably in love with Zaara. When he prepares to reveal his feelings to her as she is about to leave for Pakistan, Veer is introduced to Raza (Manoj Bajpai), Zaara's taciturn fianc\u00c3\u00a9 (chosen by her father to cement a political alliance with Raza's father). Veer is heartbroken but this does not stop him from revealing his love for Zaara, which leaves Zaara all confused.\n\nWell, back home in Pakistan, Zaara realizes that she too has fallen in love with Veer, and decides to elope with him. Veer goes to Pakistan to get her (after resigning his commission with the Air Force), but things go predictably awry and the pair are separated for more than 20 years. This is where Saamiya comes in , as she tries her best to prove that Veer was wrongfully imprisoned and to see justice meted out.\n\nThe songs are beautiful, and the cinematography conveys all the vibrant colors of the Indian countryside. The theme song is one that I fell in love with, and I plan on obtaining the soundtrack. Shah Rukh Khan plays his role flawlessly, there is no exaggeration here - and I particularly liked the final scene where Veer reads a heartrending poem he composed as he addresses the court. Preity Zinta is beautiful and delivers a credible performance as a woman torn between doing her duty to her family and listening to her heart, and the courage she displays in choosing her own destiny. This is one of the most beautiful love stories to come out of Bollywood in recent years, and I heartily recommend it.",

Veer Pratap Singh (Shah Rukh Khan) is an officer and pilot in the Indian Air Force who one day meets a beautiful Pakistani heiress, Zaara Hayaat Khan (Preity Zinta), as she travels to a small Indian village to scatter the ashes of one of her family's loyal servants. Veer has family in the village, and while most Indians show no affection for Pakistanis, his aunt and uncle are willing to take Zaara in for the night. It isn't long before Veer finds himself falling for her; however, Veer learns that Zaara is engaged to another man, Raza (Manoj Bajpai), a cruel and humorless Pakistani. A friend of Zaara contacts Veer and tells him that Zaara wants out of her engagement and has strong feelings for him, but when he comes to her rescue, matters take a turn for the worse and Veer winds up in jail. Twenty years later, Veer is still behind bars, and finds that his case is being given a new trial, but while he has a new chance at freedom, he discovers his lawyer will be going up against a state attorney who has never lost a case. Veer-Zaara was one of the first Indian blockbusters to open in India, the United States, and the United Kingdom at the same time",

Her bus, which is traveling to India with her \"bebe's\" (a Punjabi word to denote mother or grandmother, but here used for Zaara's old governess) ashes. Before dying, \"Bebe\" (Zohra Sehgal) begs Zaara to fulfill her final wish - to take her ashes to India, to the holy Sikh city of Kiritpur, and scatter her ashes in the river there, among her ancestors. Zaara decides to carry out Bebe's dying wish.\n\nIn India, Zaara's bus gets into an accident, overturns, and she is saved by an Indian pilot, Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh (Shahrukh Khan). Zaara completes her Bebe's final rites with the help of Veer. He convinces Zaara to go back to his village with him, and spend one day together. Veer then takes Zaara on a tour of India's Punjab and they visit Veer's hometown during the Lodi festival. The two fall in love and Veer is just waiting for the right time to tell Zaara how he feels about her. But then it is revealed that Zaara is engaged to another man, Raza (Manoj Bajpai). During their last few moments together, Veer confesses his love, then watches sadly as Zaara boards the train that will take her back to Pakistan. Both believe that this is the end of the story, and the last time they will ever see each other.\n\nZaara eventually realizes that she loves Veer and cannot marry her fianc\u00e9; Veer, after being told over the phone by Zara's friend Shabbo, that how miserable Zara is without him, quits the Indian Air Force and goes to Pakistan to bring her back with him to India. Zaara's mother, however, begs him to leave Zaara. Zaara's father is a high-profile politician whose reputation will be ruined if news got out that his daughter is in love with a Hindu man. Veer respects this and decides to leave. But Zaara's fianc\u00e9, outraged by the shame Zaara has brought upon him, frames Veer and has him wrongly imprisoned for being an Indian spy.\n\n22 years later, Veer meets Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), who is an idealistic Pakistani lawyer, whose mission in life is to pave the path for women's empowerment. To dissuade a female lawyer from being successful, she has been given Veer's case, an impossible case to many. The man has been languishing in prison and has not spoken for the last 22 years.\n\nVeer tells Saamiya she can do anything for the case except mention, much less subpoena, Zaara's family. He's assigned the number 786 for his prisoner number. This convinces Saamiya that God has chosen Veer for some special purpose, and determined to exonerate him, and restore his name, identity and country.\n\nAfter a number of attempts which fail to prove Veer's innocence, Saamiya goes to Veer's village in India to gather evidence proving Veer is Veer and not Rajesh Rathore the spy. There, Saamiya finds Zaara has taken over in the village for Veer's parents. Saamiya convinces Zaara to go back to Pakistan with her and finally tell the truth about Veer's identity. The judge releases Veer from prison and apologizes on behalf of Pakistan. After Veer is finally released, he and Zaara return to India together, at last reunited.",

Shahrukh Khan is at the top of his game as the dashing suitor Veer and Preity Zinta is her usual fetching self as Zaara (though she spends an awful lot of time on verge of or brimming over with tears). The real find though is Rani Mukherjee as an aspiring Pakistani lawyer, whose unflagging dedication to truth and justice is inspiring. Soundtrack nods: \"This is my land...\" (Zaara's journey to Veer's village), \"Two moments\" (Train station scene and the Mosque embrace).",

Bollywood makes romantic films at a rate that would make Nora Ephron gush, but most of these films are trite entertainments that border on annoying. Such criticisms cannot be levelled at Veer-Zaara however, a film so tragic and romantic its the contemporary equivalent of Romeo and Juliet. Veer Pratap Singh, played by Shahrukh Khan, is a hero of such romantic idealism that the film would be unbelievable if not for the romantic hero identity that has come to be associated with SRK, and Preity Zinta builds on her chemistry with Khan from their earlier work together. Special mention must go to the score of the film, which used songs by Madan Mohan, a famed composer who had been dead for 29 years at the time the film was released. It gives the film a classic quality, and includes several compositions of haunting and exquisite beauty. Featuring a great supporting cast including Rani Mukherjee and surprise appearances by Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini, Veer-Zaara is highly recommended.",

However, it not only talks about love: it mentions and shows religious problems and political/cultural issues between Pakistan and India. Another never-ending topic that it shows is FEMINISM and GENDER EQUALITY. \r\nAs you can see: time, distance, barriers, intrigues, religion, and cultural disturbances were obstacles but not barriers to destroy true love. \r\nVeer was a man from India who languish in prison in Pakistan during more than 20 yrs for something he didn't even have to do with. However, he never forgot his only and truly love, Zaara (a girl from Pakistan, who\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Muslim). \r\nIn fact, Zaara's stupid ex-fiance planned all this thing of putting Veer in the jail because he was so pissed off and embarrased because Zaara didn't marry him instead, since she realized she was in love w/ Veer (and that stupid son of a gun was embarrassed due to the fact that he and some other people saw repulsive ''a Pakistan girl in love with Indian man'' and his honor and social position were in a spot... Zaara thought Veer was dead, lost or something but he wasn't! (sorry, I watched this movie in Hindi without any English, French or Spanish subtitles... so I interpreted as I could). \r\nSaamiya, Veer's lawyer has not only the mission of defending Veer and find missing Zaara: she has to shut other MEN's and male lawyer's mouths to show WOMEN EMPOWERMENT, and express the competence of women lawyers to vindicate the real power of truth, no matter if those assholes say \"this is a man's job!'' \r\nWhat a movie, what a touching movie. Two lovers who looked like granny and grandpa in their exterior, their souls looked at each other as if they were those great young and true lovers. \r\nAm I a chatterbox? watch this movie and tell me if I was right.",

It seems it all started because of his strange encounter with a Pakistani girl named Zaara twenty years before. The story is quite captivating and the characters engaging. The musical numbers are quite delightful and in a few instances quite inventive. It could be argued that the film is a bit on the predictable side but that's hardly a fault in the long run.

An explosion of colour and song, a touching and semi-original love story and some sweet and memorable characters played with style by all concerned. Directed with a knowing and artistic eye, visually 'Veer-Zaara' never sets a foot wrong, if at times it's sentiment tips over indulgence. These are small qualms. What 'Veer-Zaara' gives us is the heartfelt love-stories that Hollywood can no longer pull off and characters we genuinly care about, get to know well and root for. If you want a real love story, than look no further. If you want an epic musical, than 'Zaara' pulls out all the stops. It is quite simply a work of beauty.",
