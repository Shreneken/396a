    "summary": "In a film that plays with the idea of straightforward storytelling, a group of troubled people find that they are linked in unpredictable ways. Paul Rivers (Sean Penn) is an academic dealing with a terminal heart condition, but his life is changed by a car crash that seems unrelated to his ailment. The traffic accident, involving ex-con Jack Jordan (Benicio del Toro) and the husband of Cristina Peck (Naomi Watts), is one that ruins lives but ultimately also resurrects them.",

            "content": "Since \"Birdman\" and \"The Revenant\", director Alejandro González Iñárritu is a visionary scope to behold, as they evolved prior through his matching skills as storyteller sharing common themes and unique techniques coordinating the focus as an unusual feat. Like any narrative with multiple lines to weave throughout, it gets tighter and grows sensibly as the story progresses, which Iñárritu defied with a nonlinear structure that poetically responds to each other organically. But what truly absorbs is being the finest showcases, arguably at memorable best by recently discovered definitive recognition, for the main starring players and what they try to represent against totally succumbing to their character-types. This is where he topped his practice before bridging onto to his more compelling mastery. (B+)",

            "content": "This is a sobering, somewhat bleak in tone film about a number of couples affected by one event - their background and so on, Sean Penn gives a good performance I thought, as does Benecio Del Toro. I found the grainy look of the film visually, there's a sort of a grainy look to the film in the way its shot/filmed, a bit distracting and not entirely appealing, although I can sort of see what the filmmaker is getting at. It's not as gritty a film as you might expect overall - there are bleak moments but there's not a massive amount of bloody violence overall, although there are some sex scenes present. It's quite an emotionally raw film in some ways but its certainly not full of sentimentality or overly sugary sweet. The characters are fairly well developed and I was interested to see what happened, though I wouldn't say it all made sense to me. I think if your a fan of Sean Penn then it's worth seeing in terms of his performance though. I feel the film is really, at its heart, about desperation and the lengths people will go to, to do what's right for them. The chronology is a little confusing on ocassion. It becomes quite powerful in the last half an hour or so though. Yes I'd recommend this film, although it won't appeal to all but its a somewhat thoughtful film with a good cast, so it's worth looking at if it sounds of interest.",

It was so raw and ugly that it colored her entire performance as a deeply committed one, eschewing dignity in favor of really showing how well she can contort her visage. The nonlinear narrative really bothered my wife, mostly because they didn't give any obvious indicator when they were going back and forth in time, making it confusing for confusion's sake. It didn't really hurt the movie for me, though it did seem like they were hiding behind a gimmick instead of standing behind the strength of their story, which was quite good. It also obscured how they were tying the characters together, leading me to prefer their less-prestigious Amores Perros to this movie, despite the superiority of the performances in this one.",

It's without debate a piece of art, in the way that it's written. it follows a very unconventional, non-linear plot line which constantly goes back and forth in time, giving us little hints on what is about to happen without ever unveiling the full story all at once. Rich is one of the adjectives which describes this movie, it's full of strong and timely themes of grief, redemption, death and the worth of life. Another very interesting aspect is that 21 Grams was almost completely filmed with hand held cameras, which gives it that gritty, realistic and raw feel to it. \nAnd it's got a golden cast filled with A list actors, with Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro. It's a movie which is sometimes heavy to bear, but it's captivating and powerful through it's storytelling and amazing performances. \nOverall, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu proves that he's definitely an artist who makes movies with passion and love, and this film proves it all. Such a good movie, recommended !!",

Instead, the audience is just left to wallow into despair as the main characters fall into deeper personal hells with each passing moment, almost to the point of parody (you received an unexpected heart transplant, Sean Penn? Hope you like trading in your hopeful relationship for a torrid affair with a terribly hurt woman who will send you down a path of revenge that ends up killing you anway). What does the fractured narrative add here, apart from a means to keep the audience invested and to plan out some moments of foreshadowing or complementary perspective? Del Toro almost never gives a bad performance, and each of the actors involved feel appropriately tortured by the events of the film, but the lack of depth apart from an almost childish nihilism weighs heavily on the final product.

So I'll just say that it's about a fatal accident and its effect on three disparate people.\n\nAs I watched this film, I wasn't sure director Iñárritu's choice to deconstruct the timeline was such a good idea. I kept imagining the story if it were told in straight chronology. After a while, I just went with it. But when it was over, I was still undecided. Perhaps Iñárritu was attempting to replicate our memory, which is not chronological. We remember moments in time, never in a straight line. We remember something that happened a year ago, then something from our childhood, then something that happened a few hours ago.\n\nAside from the stylistic aspect of this film, there are powerful performances here by all the actors. But the melodrama piles up the point of becoming overwhelming. So much pain, so much agony. \n\nI'm recommending the film for its great acting, but be ready for a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces are strewn everywhere, and you have to put it together. It's a bit of work.\n\nBy the way, the title derives from the fact that supposedly, every person who dies loses 21 grams of weight, which is thought to be the weight of the soul. Rather mysterious.",

In Amores Perros, there was more realism to the various circumstances and the way that the three stories merged together. In 21 Grams, the individual circumstances do not come together as seamlessly as Inarritu's past films. Ridiculous caricature of illness, religious conversion, and family loss. Embarrassingly over-the-top; expected more from Iñárritu. Unrealistic plot line with no variation - just over-blasted volume in the form of shaking, screaming, crying actors in every scene; and I like all three actors (Penn, Watts, and del Toro).

Some, like \"Memento,\" stretch the boundaries of convention and take wild risks such as moving the drama from the end to the beginning.  \"21Grams\" is a cinematic poetic explosion, shaking all the pieces hard as hell, and then tossing them in the air to fall at random.  Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, he gives the audience the puzzle unraveled, demanding that we piece together the story from interlaced past, present and future events.  It is part flashy gimmick, part artistic mastery, but always compelling.  The story revolves around people drawn together due to an accident, a death, and a donated heart.\n\nThis is not a film for either the faint of heart or lazy of mind.  Nor is it for those who become frustrated by film that dares to step outside the linear plot and paint-by-numbers formula.  The mishmash of past/present/future is allegorical in the sense that we all carry our past, all hinge our hearts on the future, and all struggle with a \"present\" as dotty and haunted as this film so wildly illustrates.\n\nIn \"21 Grams\" it is required that the viewer surrender.  As in life, there is no control.  I must admit that I became a bit antsy and pressed for answers when none were being provided.  You are riveted by events and players that intermingle in a haphazard mishmash of time with a rebellious lack of structure.  You can either go with the flow-or back out to your car.  Since I saw only one person exit the theater, for any reason, in the 125 minutes running time, I conclude that the fully occupied theater was as riveted as I was, even to the point of extreme bladder control. \n\nThe performances are stunning.  Sean Penn is always good, Benicio Del Toro solidifies his Oscar, and Naomi Watts is the big talent to watch.  Her emotional honesty is beyond acting-I believed her to feel the pain she displayed.\n\nThe \"plot\" almost seems inconsequential.  The film is about the depth of human feeling in our brief interplay between living and dying.  It's about damnation and redemption, revenge and forgiveness, surrender and salvation.  It offers no explanations.  It merely illustrates the human experience in a trenchant manner that makes us aware that every minute of every day is a precarious drama that we look upon more lightly than we should.\nThe dramatic cortex is the human heart-lost, gained, tormented, anguished and confused.  The metaphorical context is the fleeting nature of each heart's temporal beat and our desperately valiant struggle to flesh out our mortal hearts' desires.",

Not that there's anything wrong with it, but you really ought to be prepared to watch his films because its not easy and it deals with those universal human elements of love, loss, redemption in such delicate ways.

            "content": "Inarritu has became something of a film making guru in recent years, with the Revenant and Birdman sweeping critics into a frenzy, however delving back into the extremely talented directors back catalogue, we find a plethora of work that is wonderfully art house and pretty essential viewing. 21 Grams is on paper and for most of its run time an astounding achievement in cinema, however its inability to round off a gripping story, with a second act bathing in self absorbtion, 21 Grams leaves you feeling, slightly let down with its final moments. The film follows 3 different strangers, who's lives all intermingle around a horrid accident. 21 Grams decides to take the non linear approach, dipping in and out of these time lines, at whatever moment it deems fit and surprisingly it works perfectly, each scene feels completely isolated yet essential for the telling of the story. It never feels confusing or intrusive, jumping about different time periods in character lives, with no sense of order or time scale and if anything its a testament to Innaritu for managing to pull this kind of trick off. A large part of this is completely down to his cast, Naomi Watts, Sean Penn and Benecio Del Toro are all brutally effective, each of them having such a wonderful spark of energy and emotional weight required to drive home such a complex character piece. However 21 Grams falters when it comes to wrapping up its story, what starts off as a wonderfully simple and heartfelt tale, soon derails itself completely into preposterous territory and it feels the need to wallow in this moment for as long as humanly possible. The story works best when it is keeping it raw, simple and full of emotion, it doesnt work so well, when it continually repeats itself over and over again, with moments that add nothing new to the piece, characters will repeat actions and motivations continually almost for the sake of making it abundantly clear of the movies messages, just in case you were too lost too follow, the problem is that, there isnt much on offer here apart from a really contained story, one that really could have done with 20 minutes shaved off. All in all 21 Grams is marvelously crafted, brilliantly acted and gripping when it centres solely on character, it wades into murky waters however with a weak final act and a sense of impending boredom.",

            "content": "21 Grams. The weight of a stack of nickels. The weight of a bar of chocolate. The weight of a hummingbird. Or perhaps, the weight of our soul. Yes, you heard it right. In 1907, Dr Duncan MacDougall published a paper in the Journal Of The American Society Of Physical Research, which claims that a human body loses exactly 21 grams at the precise moment of its death, deducing that human beings have a soul. The paper has since been discredited, but the myth lived on.\n\nAnd it is based on this myth that 21 grams, a 2003 American drama was conceived. Starring Sean Penn and Naomi Watts, the story is told in a hyperlink non-linear format, where the past, present and future of three seemingly unrelated characters,  converge and coalesce towards each other as the movie progresses. Helmed by acclaimed Academy Award winning director Alejandro González Iñárritu, 21 Grams interweaves several plot lines, around the consequences of a tragic automobile accident. Penn plays a critically ill mathematician, Watts plays a grief-stricken mother, and Del Toro plays a born-again Christian ex-convict whose faith is sorely tested in the aftermath of the accident.\n\nIn the initial couple of minutes I was mesmerized by the quality of film-making I was experiencing, but could not help wondering what it was all about. The non-linear narrative confuses you initially and you even wonder if it was necessary, but once you give it time, the movie will floor you. Based on the universal themes of death, pain and salvation, the movie portrays the journey of Christina Peck, a recovering drug addict and family woman, whose life is torn apart by the death of her husband Michael and two children in a fatal accident, by a Christian reformed ex-convict Jack Jordan. She is followed by Paul Rivers, a terminally ill mathematics professor, who was given a new lease of life after a transplantation of Michael's heart.\n\nIñárritu, has a fetish for the unorthodox, which is apparent in the cinematography of Birdman. Here too, he attempts a unique style. But, eventually, style doesn't matter. Whta matters is that the film has a heart and turns into a emotional rollercoaster ride for the viewers. Love, loss, grief, misery, guilt and redemption are emotions so humane that you connect with the story and its characters. You want to cry with them, console them and give them a hand. Iñárritu successfully manages to bring out these emotions with great maturity and candor.\n\nThe screenplay by Guillermo Arriaga is gripping, the editing is crisp and the cinematography is haunting. The music and backgroung score is also incredible. The gives us a sense of the utter despair of their characters, leaving the viewer emotionally wounded. And need I say about Iñárritu. He is the force that binds the movie together. He is confident and brave in his film-making and is one to take risks, without, of course, undermining the quality of his story or its characters.\n\nThe performances are incredible. As the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes put it, the movie is full of  \"fine performances\". Everyone puts in the best they have to offer. Benicio Del Toro is outstanding as the ex-con Jack Jordan. His character is one full of layers and dimensions and brings them alive on screen with great impunity. Sean Penn too did an excellent job. One of the greatest actors of this era, he takes up a character in considerable physical and emotional pain and pulls it off effortlessly.\n\nBut the clear star of this movie is Naomi Watts. Playing a grief-stricken widow under drug abuse, she gets into the skin of the character, before pulling of one of her best performances. She is beautiful, but the pain in her eyes is unbearable. A particular scene, where she is informed of the death of her family, is heart wrenching and move you to tears. she shares a unique chemistry with Penn and the two share some beautiful moments of passion. If not for anything else, the movie is a must watch for her incredibly moving performance.\n\nAlejandro González Iñárritu is a filmmaker with panache. And with 21 grams, he tells a tale that \"grips us, moves us, and astonishes us\". Add to it some incredible performances, the movie is a must watch.",

            "content": "-21 Grams is a 2003 American drama film directed by Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu from a screenplay written by Guillermo Arriaga. It stars Sean Penn, Naomi Watts, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Danny Huston and Benicio Del Toro.\nLike Arriaga's and González Iñárritu's previous film, Amores perros (2000), 21 Grams interweaves several plot lines, around the consequences of a tragic automobile accident. Penn plays a critically ill mathematician, Watts plays a grief-stricken mother, and Del Toro plays a born-again Christian ex-convict whose faith is sorely tested in the aftermath of the accident.\nAs the second part of Trilogy of Death, 21 Grams is presented in a nonlinear arrangement where the lives of the characters are depicted before and after the accident. The three main characters each have \"past,\" \"present,\" and \"future\" story threads, which are shown as non-linear fragments that punctuate elements of the overall story, all imminently coming toward each other and coalescing as the story progresses.\n\n--Title:\n-The title refers to the early 20th-century research of physician Dr. Duncan MacDougall who attempted to show scientific proof of the existence of the immortal human soul by recording a loss of body weight (representing the departure of the soul) immediately following death. The research by MacDougall attempted to follow the scientific method and showed some variance in results (\"three-fourths of an ounce\", which has since been popularized as \"21 grams\" is the reported weight loss from the death of the first subject). MacDougall's results were published in the peer reviewed journal \"American Medicine\".\n\n--Critical response:\n-80% of the critics surveyed by Rotten Tomatoes gave the film positive reviews, based on 178 reviews with an average rating of 7.5/10. The critical consensus states that \"Alejandro González Iñárritu deftly weaves an uncommonly structured narrative with panache in 21 Grams, a stylish, haunting drama full of fine performances.\"  Roger Ebert, for example, questioned the use of non-linear narrative, but praised the acting and said of the film overall: \"It grips us, moves us, astonishes us.\" Elvis Mitchell also praised the acting and called the film \"an extraordinarily satisfying vision\" that \"may well be the crowning work of this year.\"",

            "content": "\"21 Grams\" is about sad people doing sad things, wishing they could be a different sad person for just a minute so that they can escape the pain they so constantly feel.  Their lives never pick up -- they were never that great to begin with -- and so the film acts as a mangled study of truly messed up people, sometimes compelling and sometimes so downbeat you may as well give up and moan into a judgmental pillow.  It is not a film to lift your spirits; see it for the emotions it brings, the jaw-dropping performances it contains.  When reflecting on our pampered lives, the fact that people like the characters in \"21 Grams\" may exist reminds us how lucky some of us are, even if our ease is short-lived or tinged with a little bit of depression.  We don't look down upon these people; we emphasize with them.  \n\tTold in a non-linear fashion, \"21 Grams\" focuses on three characters with the fixation of a subtle Altman film.  They are Paul (Sean Penn), Cristina (Naomi Watts), and Jack (Benicio Del Toro).  Paul is unhappily married to Mary (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who longs for a baby but is rendered hopeless due to Paul's dangerous heart condition.  Cristina, once a happily wed woman with two lovely young daughters, has lost her husband and kids in a bloody hit-and-run, turning back to past drug addictions to make herself feel something besides nothing.  Jack is an ex-convict who is trying to curb his criminal and alcoholic ways through faith, but is failing miserably.  These people are all connected in some way or another, but to reveal the source of their crossing paths would strip the film of the pleasures you won't have.\n\tDespite being one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen, \"21 Grams\" is still one of the best acted, bringing together a magnificently emotive ensemble and giving them what are perhaps the most rewarding (at least to watch) roles of their careers.  Penn is a man torn between two equally devastating lives: in one, he is a sick man with a desperate wife clinging to his side; in the other, he is the co-dependent to a mentally unstable drug addict.  Watts, in a performance so harrowing it would be a wonder if she didn't suffer while piecing together her characterization, is gut-wrenching as a woman so broken that we can only ask ourselves why she isn't shattered into a million pieces below our feet.  And Del Toro is an embodiment of human suffering as a man who wants to atone for his sins but falls immediately after he stands up once again.\n\tEverything about \"21 Grams\" is phenomenal, but despite its triumphs, I still have reservations about Gonzalez-Inarritu's decision to edit the film in inconsequential order.  Some movies have done it well (\"Memento\", without a doubt), but in \"21 Grams\"' case, it's a loud concern that undermines the connected stories.  Because we don't get to see characters develop in the usual sense, it's harder to grasp them as people, grip their personal stories as if they are our own.\n\tIf \"21 Grams\" isn't perfect and isn't tempting to embrace, that's beside the point.  This is a frustrating but visceral film that overwhelms us with its sorrow, its despair.  It doesn't feel good, sure, but one rarely gets the opportunity to experience something this exhilarating.",

But as the movie progresses, it comes together very smoothly, and then 21 Grams finds the perfect spot to end it all. Unfortunately, there is an hour and 20 minutes left still.\n21 Grams is an example of a perfect short film that was stretched into a full-length squandering. After the first 30 minutes, it fails to keep things interesting or even entertaining, but keeps shooting melodramatic hits at you like saying \"Look at these people, their lives are so miserable\". Worst of all, you sit through it waiting for a glimmer of hope in this despairing squalid wad.\nOf course, it's not all far gone as the characters in this film. The bleakness in 21 Grams is at times beautiful, mainly because of the masterful combination of director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu and cinematographer Rodrigo Pietro. Add to that a tear-jerking Gustavo Santaolalla Score and you've got yourself a pretty film. Then you get some nice performances from Naomi Watts and Benicio Del Toro, at times either a little too stiff or a little too exagerated but throughout very solid. And then the movie is an incurable mess.\nEverything, from the everlasting burden to the ridiculous runtime, I lost anything to hold on to, and when the credits roll, I was so happy, and promised myself never to sat through that depressing truss again.",

It's the\nscenes in this film without any dialogue that stick with me the most.\nThe emotion or lack of emotion on the faces of the actors is\nunparalleled.

There really aren't any long scenes which is one of the\nreasons it's impossible to step away from the film. It's a real crime\nthriller, but it also gives us a look at people dealing with true\ndespair and how hard it is to instill hope again.

Alejandro IÃÂ±ÃÂ¡rritu puts dark and disturbing things in front of us here, but for some reason the only word I can think that does this film any justice is \"beautiful.\"\n\nThis film has a lot to say, and while the nonlinear narrative and structuring may throw some people off, it's still a profound film that explores many difficult subjects. This film looks to explore subjects ranging from simple right and wrong to the human psyche and why we even exist. What made this film so powerful to me was easily the way IÃÂ±ÃÂ¡rritu composed it. He jumps around in time, but he never shows you anything too soon. Tracking with it was a bit of a chore at times, but I didn't care because the filmmaking talent was so mind-blowing.\n\nOne of my favorite aspects of the film was the performances, more specifically Benicio Del Toro. I expect great things from Sean Penn and Naomi Watts at this point in their careers, but Benicio Del Toro just totally blew my mind. I hadn't seen \"Traffic\" or \"Snatch\" prior to this point so I simply knew him as the guy from \"The Wolfman.\" I loved that I didn't know whether to side with his character or not. Whenever a character is very complex or it's difficult to understand their motives I'm always more drawn to them. Benicio had me convinced the whole way that he was hurt, and losing faith. A beautiful performance!\n\nThe visual style was very interesting to me as well. The cinematography was fairly basic through most of it, but actually what surprised me was the way that IÃÂ±ÃÂ¡rritu composed the sex scene between Penn and Watts. It was very beautiful, and not overly sexualized. This is what I think sex scenes should be: it was shot to fit the tone, and not simply to turn on the viewer. It was very beautiful and elegant.\n\nOverall this was an incredible film that I saw a lot of inspiration in. Mr. IÃÂ±ÃÂ¡rritu, you have my attention.",

            "content": "21 Grams utterly wastes potential of a talented cast and decent storyline on the single error of a muddled narrative structure which Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and many critics are convinced is beneficial to the film. All I got from it was directionless unstructured confusion which failed to make an impact.\n21 Grams' ultimate flaw is what makes it stand out from all other drama films of its type: it's plot structure. It puts its dynamics all over the place without ever considering how it might me a mesmerising confusion to viewers. It was to me because I was so confused that by about halfway through I had given up attempting to assemble pieces of the complicated puzzle and instead just sat back to focus more on the acting and such. But I'll always remember 21 Grams for its excessively complicated plot structure. When you change the structure of a story for a film it has to be done lightly, by which I mean if it would be executed in a non-linear narrative it would have to clearly be obvious to audiences and still comprehensible as a story. Such examples would be the complex plot structure in Pulp Fiction which is one of its highest qualities, or in Quentin Tarantino's debut effort Reservoir Dogs. In 21 Grams the plot structure is Humpty Dumpty; it fell and hit the ground shattering into many pieces for all the kings horses and all the kings men not to be able to put back together again. If you can then that would be surprising, but I was too thrown off by it to even be sure what to believe anymore. I can't comment much on the story in 21 Grams because I still don't exactly know what the hell the story was. I enjoyed the concept about how the characters became interwoven in such complex ways, but if 21 Grams had a regular plot structure I at least could have enjoyed it as a generic drama film. Now I can only see it as a model ship with missing pieces, by which I mean it looks good on the surface but I can't connect what is missing and therefore it's an incomplete film. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu really didn't think through how people who didn't have their minds invested deeply in the story may not pick up on every element, and if the story was more interesting its likely that I would have. Alas, that is not the case. \n21 Grams loses credibility for its structure, direction and sub-decent plotting, but other elements are good. Half the plot is in fact decent, the alf which chronicles Cristina Peck's husband dying in a car crash and Paul Rivers entering a relationship with her after getting his heart donated. Although it isn't explored as insightfully as it could have been it's decently scripted and well acted.\nNaomi Watts is the standout in 21 Grams because she shows off what Australian talent is all about. Naomi Watts' talent is all in her ability to naturally react to the drama in the story. Her reactions seem genuine and her emotional intensity is rich, and it's so powerful that it's almost shocking. Her performance skewed a deserving Academy Award nomination, and anyone who has seen 21 Grams cannot deny that she is in fact a very talented actress, particularly at dramatic work.\nSean Penn was also very good. I mean you  could expect nothing less from the man who has won 2 Academy Awards for Best Actor amongst multiple nominations, and in 21 Grams he's so down to earn and his character is so basic. The effort Sean Penn puts into characterising him is great, even though he's portraying an ignorant character who continues to smoke after heart surgery.\nAnd of course the talents of Benicio Del Toro are no lesser. Despite being featured in the less gripping storyline, Benicio Del Toro still manages to use the same naturally powerful acting talents which won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Traffic and scored him another nomination for 21 Grams. He's certainly a memorable presence and has a lot of power in his facial gestures and line delivery, so he does benefit the film.\nBut really director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu really takes 21 Grams for granted, using a sub decent story and a great cast as an excuse to test a poor plot structure out on a film.",

I think the primary problem is the fractured narrative, which here feels arbitrarily applied. There are some neat conclusions we find out in a delayed fashion, but, as a whole, they don't add much to the story. \n\nThis mechanism outlives it's usefulness past the first hour, once the film has shown most of its hand. Told in a linear fashion, I wonder if the individual moments of the script would hold more power than the way they're presented currently. The plot dips into melodrama a bit too often as a result, instead of the tragedy it's aiming for.\n\nThat's not to discredit the acting, which is very well rounded due to an excellent cast. Naomi Watts delivers a particularly effective performance as a former addict trying to turn her life around as a mother. The technical elements are top notch as well. There's a great sense of visual language in the filmmaking, and the cinematography is a dream to look at. The sound design is inventive and a strong part of the storytelling, although the number of soft-loud transitions wore out their welcome.\n\nIt's just that without the gimmicky narrative structure, I'm left to wonder how interesting or unique the story actually is. I wanted to get emotionally invested, but there was something getting in the way of me making that leap.",
