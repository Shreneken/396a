Jin-tae makes a bargain with his commander: He'll take the riskiest missions if it will help shield Jin-seok from battle.

A real story for many people who lived during this era.\n\nGreat war movie for those wanting to learn more about Korean culture or the Korean War.\n\nDuring on re-watching of the climax, I left on Led Zepplin's Stairway to Heaven by accident and had goosebumps throughout.\n\nBe warned though: the action in this movie leaves no room for imagination. It's brutal and bloody, just like the war. So if you're squeamish about blood, you'll need to close your eyes more than once.\n\n5/5. Cannot stress how much I love this movie.",

Although quite lengthy (2 1/2 hours), I thought the film had an intriguing plot, and of course, a riveting ending that'll make you shed manly tears. A definite must-watch. 2nd to Saving Private Ryan in terms of production, but first of its kind to get me bawling at a war movie.",

Through the atrocities they witness the brothers bonds are put to the ultimate test! an absolutely heart wrenching story! loved it!! if you dont mind subtitles or sitting through a two hour plus film! this is foreign cinema at its finest!!",

The Brotherhood of War has an A + presentation of a war epic just from it's breathtaking cinematography to the brilliant performances from Korea's finest. Though I have some problems watching it. There are a lot of rushed up scenes to fit up the whole story line from its beginnings to its climax. And overuse of fast paced camera shots which those sequences could be memorable but then its more of a waste. But then it end in a pretty dramatic fashion. It is there though it could have been better.",

            "content": "\"Tae Guk Gi \"  probably will stand as one of the great war movies in the years to come. The story is beautiful , emotional and very intimate even more against the backdrop of the battles. Yes it is over dramatic  - but isn't movies about all that? To begin with the positives - this is a beautiful , intimate and driving story right till the very end.  The war , the battles and the realism involved in such horror is nicely portrayed throughout the film. Director Je-gyu Kang really shows how to show the true side of wars keeping the artistic form in mind. With jerking handheld cameras predominant in the movie , the cinematography is very detailed and purposeful. Even to a non keen observer even without the visual effects , the camera shots are enough to tell you when is the time of war and when is the time of peace. Production value is extremely high , extremely detailed. Moving on to the effects , this is one of the best realistic effects put on screen , limited explosions and more frag effects of grenades and other artillery weapons. Apart from depiction of short bursts of battles which are brilliant , the movie also delves in both sides of the war - something many war movies do not reach to . The movie is not biased and its more central to the nature of war rather than the war itself - the effects and motivation that war posses. The best way to achieve that is to make a family go through that  and that is what the film is about . Values of mercy , choice and the reason for fighting is all the movie is about and all of that is portrayed through a beautiful love story between two brothers. Now even after this , as a film it suffers - primarily through under development of suspense during the first hour of the movie and over indulgence in quick battle sequences. Now as good as every action piece was , one can't help but feel the interim between two battles is not developed - there is an abrupt sense or loose sense of development during the first part as if it was lacking focus. The real bugging factor is the abrupt editing - something which takes away from the good moments of the film . Some of the editing choices were poor making the scenes feel not so coherent as it is supposed to. Even the ending editing choice was somewhat confusing. Again with great horrors of war should come equally believable performance- something which was lacking again during the first hour of the movie. The second half was absolutely brilliant cranking up the stakes and emotions which every scene building upon the previous one but the first hour suffered as the performances were quite bland and was not able to connect to the audience. Again directing wise and with some over the top music certain dramatic sequences were over dramatized. Now the imagery and the flow was powerful enough but too much music does take away from the intimate moments. Emotions were created but on repeated viewings that will come down because the music becomes a distraction. Apart from these flaws , the movie does not show any other and in fact quite a thrilling watch. It is gross , it is horrifying but it is intimate and it is beautiful.",

            "content": "This is one of all times best war movies, with intense action to match even Saving Private Ryan. The story is great, showing the war by two types of soldiers. One is the daring, courages killer who will do anything to have his little brother sent home. The other is the little brother, who is not cut out to fight in battle. The movie reminds me a lot of Saving Private Ryan, my favorite war movie, and therefore it's an easy like for me. The acting is great, the battle scenes are very intense,  plot is new, and the ending is very good. It is also one if the few movies that integrates a love story well with all the war.  It's a little over heroic at times, and the soldiers are a little overly accurate shooters, but it's never boring and it keeps you engaged the entire time.  There is no doubt that Korea has made some outstanding war movies. Number seven on my top 15 war movie list.",

The action is honest and well-done, but extraordinarily violent and perhaps a little exhausting. It is a bit like watching the Omaha beach scene in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN over and over.  The acting is even bigger and more dramatic than the fighting.  Lots of melodrama, lots of screaming, and huge facial expressions dominate.  The characters seem to be right out of dozens of American WWII movies.  I almost expected to see a kid from Brooklyn wearing a Dodgers cap in the platoon.  It is all well done, though, and very refreshing to see this oft-ignored war get a big-budget treatment.  It is also interesting to see it from the Korean perspective.  Americans are seldom mentioned and never seen.",
