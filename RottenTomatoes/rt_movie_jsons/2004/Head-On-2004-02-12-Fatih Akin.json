    "summary": "Cahit (Birol \u00dcnel) stumbles from bar to bar in Hamburg, Germany, lost in an alcoholic haze. The boozy Turkish immigrant crashes his car into a wall, which lands him in a mental institution. There he meets the suicidal Sibel (Sibel Kekilli). She convinces him to marry her, because otherwise her family will arrange her marriage to a Turkish man of their choosing. She proposes a deal to Cahit: She will cook and clean for him and they can see other people. Thus begins their strange romance.",

            "content": "First prison I've ever seen with wall-to-wall carpeting.\n\nHead-On is an example of a particularly well-trodden Hollywood premise (a mismatched couple in a marriage of convenience legitimately falling in love) and making it a legitimate drama - contemporary social conflicts, humor and barbs in equal measure, and protagonists with flaws that highlight a sense of realism without sacrificing their likability. What makes the film work most of all is the time dedicated to allowing the characters to grow as a direct result of their exposure to one another, transitioning from a slapdash engagement to a genuinely complementary dynamic that sees the two fluttering between longing, perplexity, affection, and melancholy. There's a degree of legitimate suffering in the film that makes the audience actually invested in the fate of the two characters without feeling exploitative; when the pair are left in a hotel room conversing in short, pained sentences, writer-director Fatih Akin earns that moment. Really solid performances from Birol \u00dcnel as Cahit and Sibel Kekilli as Sibel. \n\nObligatory \"HEAD-ON: APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE FOREHEAD.\" (3.5/5)",

But how did he fall madly in love with this woman? because she fixed up his apartment and made him a couple of nice meals!? And then, the lead woman character turns from a wild character to a normal woman. that transformation itself is believable given what happened to her, but, again, no detail is revealed to the audience as to the process of transformation. The movie certainly has very dramatic moments. But i got the feeling that they were there just for the sake of having dramatic moments. But they didn't tie together or to a larger story. But hey, maybe that's life. A lot of stuff happens without ever making a huge sense or impact on your life. The music is used effectively to double the drama of the moment. Camera work is awesome. But at the end of the day, I think this movie is overrated. and to be honest, I think a reason for that may be that it has lots of nudity/soft porn. It's worth a watch.",

            "content": "Germany and Turkey, two countries, one with no identity and the other one with a strong one. Two quiet different cultures with different traditions and rules. There's four million Turks living in Germany, and one of them is Fatih Akin who made this film called Head-On which is a film about the strong Turkish identity and how it's affecting them in a country that is far from their native mother land, and how it don't prevent them from following the religious dogmas and rules about family honor from their country.\n\nCahit Tomruk (Birol \u00dcnel), an alcoholic homosexual Turkish immigrant has just ended up in a hospital after a failed suicide attempt where he drove a car right into a wall. On the hospital he meets a young Turkish girl in her early twenties, Sibel (Sibel Kekilli). She's also there because of a suicide attempt, in order to escape her extremely traditional parents. She then ask Cahit to marry her so that she can get her parents of her back. Cahit is against it at first, but agree's on the condition that they both can live their separate lives. But after all Cahit begins to develops real feelings for her, and she does the same, but one day Cahit hits Sibel's former lover with a bottle out of anger, and he ends up in jail, while Sibel who is now a dishonor to her family is in danger of being killed by her own brother. She then escape to Istanbul to live with her cousin Selma, but her longing for Cahit makes her want to ease the pain by using narcotics. How will it end? Is there any light in the end of the tunnel?\n\nHead-On is a heavy lightning down to earth dark film about individuals who have given up on life and have sunken as low as possible. It sort of reminds me of a Rainer Werner Fassbinder film in that way that we follow the lowest creature in the Hierarchy, pretty much like in Fox and His Friend where a young hustler who finds himself in company with a bigger elite, and is out of touch with this community and don't fit in. It's the same in Head-On, only this time it's all about Cahit's Turkish identity that is the question when he's involved with a family of Turks, while Cahit's Turkish is kind of rusty. He is out of touch with his own Turkish Identity, basically he doesn't belong anywhere.\n\nSibel is like Cahit, a rebel. But she doesn't have the same background, plus she's also more pubertal, because she's grown up in a more liberal society than her parent's. She wants to brake free from her family traditions, or as she herself put it \"I want to live, I want to dance, I want to fuck... and not only with one guy\". But she also get to see for herself what to much harm freedom can do to a person.\n\nWhat's so special about Turkish/German films is that their Motherland is always in their mind and is sort of like a place for escapism. Head-On is a strong film about this Turkish identity and how it effects people's lives. It show us how low a person can sink because they want to deny who they really are. Head-On clearly shows this in a brutal way by drug abuse and adultery. It's a strong film, well crafted by a great screenplay and some marvelous realistic acting, specially by the two leads Birol \u00dcnel and Sibel Kekilli who have such a great chemistry that every actors should have. A big thumbs up from me.",

            "content": "Turkish-German cinema has reached a great turning-point. Gone are the days when the films produced by Gastarbeiter directors pointed a huge, dirty finger of blame at Germany for the troubles of the Turkish community. Gegen Die Wand takes the original approach of blaming the problems of the inability of Turkish people to come to terms with their own identities. Thus, despite being a German film, set in Germany, with much German being spoken, this film is essentially Turkish in spirit. It's about two Turkish Germans who live very different, but similarly restricted lives. Sibel is restricted by her ultra conservative and traditional family, whereas Cahit is restricted only by himself and his addiction to drugs and alcohol. Sibel, desperate to break away from her patriarchal family, begs Cahit to marry her. Eventually, he does and so begins a vicious tale of star-crossed lovers. I don't want to reveal too much about the film's plot, but it's excellent and engrossing.\n\nThe acting in Gegen Die Wand is exceptional. Birol Unel is tremendously effective as Cahit. He speaks German like a German would and speaks Turkish with a heavy accent, perfect for his role of a Turk who has lost all sense of Turkish identity. His is a tough, grotesque role, but he plays it really well and is definitely one of the memorable parts of the film. Sibel Kekilli also gives a stellar performance in the film. She plays a character who switches between her German and Turkish identities as it suits her and this ever-changing attitude is reflected well by Kekilli's acting. The supporting cast is less effective but that's only because their role in the film is quite a bit smaller than those of Cahit and Sibel.\n\nAkin, as a director, is undoubtedly excellent and his direction in this film is first rate. He delves right into this controversial subject matter and is not afraid to make deep, influential statements about anything he has an opinion on. In the \"Movie Info\", it states that Akin is a \"German-born Turkish filmmaker\". Well, no, he's actually a German filmmaker with Turkish roots. He said himself about this film that it is \"a German film with a Turkish soul\". These words describe it better than anybody else could do.",

This is easily Akin's most graphic film yet still one of his best.\nPlot: Cahit and Sibel are Turkish immigrants living in Hamburg. Cahit is an alcoholic drug addict and Sibel comes from a family that strictly follow Turkish customs and are extremely religious. Both have tried to commit suicide before. To break free of her family, Sibel and Cahit marry. At first they don't love each other but as time goes on their love for one another begins to grow, but so do their problems.\nDirected by Fatih Akin( The Edge of Heaven, In July, Soul Kitchen), Head-On is one of those intense dramas that sticks with you. With subject matter dealing with attempted suicide, sex, and jealousy, there are a few disturbing and very intense scenes. But despite it's graphic content, this is still a film that shouldn't be missed. The characters are solid and evolve greatly over the course of the story. The problem now a days is that by the end of the movie the character is the same person as he or she was at the beginning. This is not the case in this. This is just a very original film, have none of the Drama/Romance clich\u00c3 (C)s. There is something about all of Akin's films that make them so interesting to watch. This is supposed to be Akin's best work, but I found In July to be better. Total score: 9.2/10",

            "content": "Shocking, yes.  Fatih Akin's \"Head-On\" blew me away.\r\n\r\nHead-On (2005) - 9.0/10\r\nDirector - Fatih Akin\r\nCast - Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli, Catrin Striebeck, Given Kirac, Meltem Cumbul, Cem Akin, Aysel Iscan, Demir Gokgol\r\n\r\nI've watched some excellent films the past month but one film gets the \"wow treatment\", and that's Fatih Akin's \"Head-On\".  Wow, just wow!  I was just completely blown away by this shocking but truly absorbing film.\r\n\r\nSet in Hamburg, Germany \"Head-On\" the story follows two Turkish immigrants.  Cahit (Birol Unel) is a 40 year old boozer and loser who loves punk rock music.  After a drunken binge he crashes his car \"head-on\" into a wall.  At the psychiatric hospital he meets 20 year old Sibel (Sibel Kekilli).  Sibel had just slashed her wrist in a botched suicide attempt.  She just wants to get away from her very traditional, restrictive and conservative Turkish family.  She isn't really interested in Cahit as a husband in the truest sense but needs a Turkish man to marry so she can escape and lead a much more adventurous life.  Cahit, in need of change himself, eventually agrees.  What follows is anything but a traditional love story.  Sibel spends her evenings clubbing, sleeping with other men.  Cahit, when not in a drunken stupor, spends his time with a hairdresser.  Husband and wife don't sleep with each other.  But over the course of the film Sibel and Cahit begin to have genuine feelings for one another.  However the self-destructive nature of each threatens to destroy the one meaningful thing they have.\r\n\r\nWow,  Okay I said that already.  I just think this film is freaking amazing!  Ironic considering neither Cahit or Sibel appear to be likable characters.  And on the surface they are anything but likable.  Cahit is a boozing, grumpy loser.  Sibel is carefree and selfish.  They appear to mix like oil and water.  But beneath the rough exteriors lie two complex and very human characters.  You learn to like them despite all their warts.  And over the course of the film you understand why they need each other.  No this isn't your typical fluffy Hollywood romance.  It's deep, dirty and often downright disturbing.  It's also brilliant and daring filmmaking!  \r\n\r\nThis is my first experience with Turkish/German director Fatih Akin and there will be more soon.  It's as relentlessly honest as it is enertaining.  The film can be brutal and bloody at times, but just when Akin exhausts you emotionally he cuts to an orchestra playing traditional Turkish music by a river.  The music is cheery and hopeful and a welcomed contrast to much of the film.  Late eighties/early 90's music plays a key as well, with songs by Depeche Mode and the Sisters of Mercy used brilliantly.  The acting by the two leads is absolutely stellar.  Birol Unel and Sibel Kekilli are riveting and play off one another extremely well.  It's rare to get two performances this good in one film. \r\n\r\nAkin also does an excellent job of showing how Western culture impacts cultural mores by blending both attitudes and music with traditional Turkish music and morals.  Sibel feels suffocated by her tradition while Cahit has, over time, become so westernized that he struggles to speak his native language.  But over the course of the film Akin shows how important these Turkish roots really are.\r\n\r\nOverall I can't recommend this one enough.  It may be too brutal (and honest) for passive viewers but for those looking for a challenging relationship film \"Head-On\" is well worth a watch.",

Head On/Gegen Die Wand is so compelling I clapped spontaneously after it finished. Imagine doing that by yourself in your own living room. This is more than just a drama with sexually explicit scenes. It is a story about love and how it can also destroy you, change your life and take you on a journey where you have no idea what is coming around the corner. It is also a story about migration, cultural compulsions and behaviours and how displaced communities behave, how they connect back to their land of origin and what part that plays in your life. When I think of why Sibel behaves the way she does after Cahit goes to jail is because she is dead for her parents. No love, no support, no empathy-all to maintain family honour. This film took me through all kinds of emotions. From anger to sadness, laughter at the funny moments, exasperation and ultimately reflection.",

Like most good films, you could probably make a list of over twenty items that could be argued as themes of the film. \r\nThe film is highly stylized, and each scene is very meticulously designed, propped, and colored to render the atmospheric underground world the characters inhabit. The camera work is very well done, focusing the viewer's attention to the realistic aspects of the story. I personally found the interludes of the Turkish music to be a nice touch, probably because I really enjoyed the music of the film. \r\nThe story is well-paced, rife with conflict, and undpredictable yet engaging enough to maintian the viewer's undivided attention throughout. The casting of Head-On is almost perfect. Each character looks, feels, and acts very naturally in their specific role. \r\nThe presence of Western lifestyle and Turkish culture almost become their own characters in the film. These two entities are at conflict with each other, and this clash serves to add depth and specificity to the context of the story.  \r\nHead-On is a fiercely involving drama that will no doubt leave a biting resonance in the viewer, even if they don't \"like\" the film. The level of graphic violence may be distasteful to some viewers, but I thought the violence was artistically rendered and relevant to the story. There were no wasted scenes in this film, unless you consider the Turkish musical interludes to be superflous. But like I said before, I thought the musical interludes made contributions to the film.",

The period in which country meant identity of film (\"French\"/\"German\"/\"Italian\"/etc.) in Europe ends, and European Films are getting more and more diverse, and Akin, considering his identity, is probably one of the symbolic figures of it. I feel very good about his stance of telling a story, because he rather makes characters first and lets them move and make a story than makes a story first and puts characters into it as if they are men of chess. I, however, couldn't assimilate myself with characters well, probably because they are people in the world I am not too familiar with... What the film deals with, something universal, does move me, but I could not get into the world of the film much at this first time of watching it.

But there are some interesting ideas here, however, the story tries to do way too much and loses its potency.  My favorite thing about the movie was the musical interludes.  The cinematography was also fantastic.  All in all though I was very disappointed because \"The Edge of Heaven\" by Akin was an absolutely brilliant film and I expected more from this film.",
