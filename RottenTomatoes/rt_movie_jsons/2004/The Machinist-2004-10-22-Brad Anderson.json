    "summary": "Factory worker Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale) suffers from insomnia so severe that his condition has taken its toll on his weight and his mental health. When Trevor unintentionally causes an on-the-job accident that horribly injures a coworker (Michael Ironside), he begins to become even more troubled. Despite a relationship with Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a pretty prostitute, Trevor descends further into paranoia, blaming his problems on an enigmatic figure named Ivan (John Sharian).",

Its quite atmospheric and does well at making the viewer feel on edge, seeing things from the main characters point of view, making us question his frame of mind and wonder what will ultimately happen. I was very aware of the way the lighting was done, in that it appears as if most things are in either black and white or greyscale, almost as if the colour has been literally drained from the people and objects we view. Of course that can be  linked straight back to the main plot of the main character being in a less than refreshed and energetic state.\n\nChristian Bale does well portraying the main character - he certainly looks very much on edge and paranoid, almost ghostlike in appearance after a while, with dark rings appearing around his eyes. I found it to be quite an intriguing, tense and engrossing watch. Its the sort of film where you find yourself guessing what might happen next, whats to come. Its an edgy watch, not entirely scary as such but certainly fairly gritty and probably not an ideal watch if your not keen on (if but mild-ish) jump scares. The music featured had a Hitchcock-ian feel to it - I suppose the film does have a bit of that about it, although thats not to say I'd compare it directly with the classic directors work but for a film of this type, its certainly worth seeing. Unsurprisingly, overall, I would definitely recommend this film.",

Dark, chilling, harrowing, and consistently fascinating, this noirish mystery-puzzler is intricately structured to great effect. Themes of paranoia and guilt slowly emerge from the engrossing narrative as director Brad Anderson keeps the tension on high and never lets it come down. Christian Bale also delivers a genius performance here. His astounding physical transformation makes him look like Death personified. He is horrifying to look at, and the moody cinematography, score, lighting and color palate create a nightmarish world--a bleak grey hell--surrounding this troubled skeletal being. It's a superior thriller, brilliantly mounted and executed, and Bale proves his status as one of the greatest actors of his generation",

I thought some of the music cues were strange choices for their scenes and was reminded of Psycho throughout, but all of those observations are dwarfed by the sheer spectacle of Bale having emaciated himself like that. It was a relatively minor aspect of the plot but the filmmakers clearly knew what they had in front of them because there were rarely more than a few minutes between shots of him with his shirt off. People who haven't seen the movie but who have seen still images of him looking scrawny are not aware of how much a spoiler that is because it is absolutely the focal point of the production. I wouldn't necessarily say that's a bad thing; it certainly made the movie more memorable, and it's an impressive thing that an actor did, but it just sort of feels... adjacent to the movie as a whole, like how I would remember a movie better if a fight broke out in the theater or something. Anyway, I know the movie itself was pretty good because I can imagine enjoying it even if there not been a human husk in the center of every scene.",

            "content": "Much has been written about Christian Bale losing 60 pounds for this role. He looks like a walking skeleton. I see it more as a circus stunt than anything else. But thankfully, he can also act.\nI am also annoyed by directors who tint their film, in this case mostly gray. They think it adds something to the story. It doesn't. It actually a distraction more than anything else. Halfway through this movie, I was dying to watch something from the 1950's in Technicolor. The final third ofthe film becomes  more  colorful. I have no idea why. \nBut aside from that, \"The Machinist\" is intriguing and very strange. Bales plays Trevor Reznik, a factory worker who makes machine parts.  In the opening scene, we see him disposing of a body and rolling it into the water. We then see him with his favorite hooker Stevie, (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and then we see him working his machine in the factory. He also frequents an airport diner where he converses with Marie, the night shift waitress (Aitana Sanchez) and never eats the pie he ordered. Both women are worried about him. He tells Stevie  in another scene that he hasn't slept in a year. He sits in a chair at night, reading Dostoevsky's \"The Idiot.\"\nA fellow worker loses an arm in a machine at work, and it looks like Trevor's fault. Trevor's boss says he's concerned about him and makes him take a urine test. Trevor keeps seeing a weird co-worker named Ivan, but according to his bosses, no such man exists. Trevor obsessively bleaches everything at home, including his own hands. He's so spaced out and distracted, he writes Post It notes to himself, reminding him to pay the electric bill and recording his ever-declining weight. But when he leaves a note on his refrigerator, the next day, the note has changed to a symbol than looks like the start of a game of hangman.\nDo you see a story coalescing here? Of course not. You're expected to be patient, and things will eventually make sense. Right?\nLittle by little, pieces fall into place. Far be it from me to reveal anything. But this movie is compulsively watchable, not just because of the mystery, but because of Bale's performance. He's actually a pretty likeable guy, but how do we reconcile that with what we saw in the first scene? \nThere's a magnificent segment in a creepy funhouse at an amusement park that Trevor visits with Marie and her young son. It's been done before, but not like this. Besides lots of dismembered limbs, there's a sign that reads \"Crime and Punishment.\" More shades of Dostoevsky. \nWhat does it all mean? That's the fun of movies like this: putting it all together.",

The film's allure is its timelessness, attention to detail, and thoughtful characters.  Each character is unique-- and has his/her own exclusive emotions, responses, and needs.  The use of dull color to capture images of the daily grind (at least for many Americans) is very clever.  The film's cinematography evokes exhaustion and apprehension in its audience (themes simultaneously explored by the film's plot).  The Machinist is a meticulously crafted work of art.  Ohh-- and when a viewer becomes bored with all of that, I suppose he/she can appreciate Christian Bale's mind bending body transformation (which is highly disturbing).  That's not to mention Jennifer Jason Leigh's warm heart-- and gorgeous tits.  Talk about a film that has it all.  The scenes featuring Trevor and Marie together are quite pretentious.  I believe the pretentiousness is Trevor's way of experiencing empathy and regret-- prematurely.  If those scenes seem strange to you, then think carefully about this.  I can easily score The Machinist 5 out of 5 stars because it ticks all my boxes.",

The Machinist is an urban nightmare, many scenes devoid of color, filled with squalor and grime.

Whatever the reason, the Spanish-made psychological thriller The Machinist fell flat, nearly overshadowing its own plot with Bales' unavoidable physique, a mere ghost of himself, shedding a reported 62 pounds and reducing his mass to 120.\n\nEvidently, Bale had planned on dropping yet another 20 pounds, but the filmmakers quickly put a stop to it, concerned over the insistent method actor's health. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not pointing any fingers at Bale (I heard he has a temper!), because I'm sure he fulfilled his part to a tee, but Reznik's chronic insomnia nearly put me to sleep. In fact, Bale's sacrificial performance was committedly daunting, reminding me of a recent movie that asked as much from its star Michael Fassbender, who also went on a crash diet for his role in Hunger (2008).\n\nReznik (a tip of the hat to Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor) is a machinist--go figure--who hasn't been able to fall asleep in about a year. He leads a lonely existence, estranged from his past, scrapping by on the part-time affection of a discerning call girl named Stevie (Single White Female's Jennifer Jason Leigh) and the imagined chit-chat of an airport waitress named Maria (A Walk in the Clouds' Aitana Sanchez-Gijon).\n\nThe frail machinist corrodes into a paraniod state of confusion, starving himself for reasons unbeknown to us until...well never, really! I never fully understood the point of Reznik's hunger strike, even after the film untangled itself at the very end, explaining Reznik's behaviour as the result of a hit-and-run that ate at him, quite literally.\n\nThe Machinist ended--finally--when Reznik confessed what he had buried beneath layers of denial and a puzzling eating disorder, all of which piled into one big ball of shit that sunk him into a comatose mess, parallel with Anderson's irksome effort.\n\nThe tipping point was that I had actually recently watched The Machinist before, but I had perceptibly erased it from my memory, just like Reznik does with his vehicular manslaughter. In fact, as every scene kicked in I had no idea what was going to happen, barely recognizing the storyline as it ploddingly flowed, despite a prior viewing that obviously left no impression on me. Add in a pesky score that did no favours for the film, and The Machinist lost itself early off, too concerned with shocking its audience.\n\n*This review was originally written in 2009.",

            "content": "Before I can delve into why I'm disproportionately obsessed with this movie now, I need to give some background on my mental health status. I have an eating disorder (OSFED, which means that my disorder doesn't fit the DSM's strict criteria for anorexia or bulimia, but I have also been diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia at different times, so it depends on who you ask), OCD, schizoaffective disorder, and high-functioning autism (or Asperger's, depending on what you want to call it, my clinicians use both terms). This will all be relevant later, trust me.\n\nSo I first came across this movie before I had developed most of my mental health issues- it was being hyped up on WatchMojo (don't look at me like that, everyone watches WatchMojo whether we like it or not) as a compelling psychological thriller in the vein of Fight Club (to be fair almost nothing can top Fight Club), Shutter Island, Memento, Insomnia, etc. People were even comparing it to the work of Hitchcock, Lynch, and Polanski. I admit I came into it with high expectations. So when I watched this for the first time, I was not that impressed. Then, when reading trivia for this film on IMDb, I discovered that there were lots of hidden details (like in Fight Club) that I missed upon first viewing, so thinking that this may be a better movie than I gave it credit for, I watched it again, looking out for minor details. Finding them, I kicked myself (metaphorically) for not noticing some of the obvious foreshadowing the first time around. Again I was not really impressed by the film, thinking it to be too derivative of other psychological thrillers and not really having anything original except for the the weight loss element. But I'll get into that later. I also hadn't seen Bale in anything except for this movie, Batman, and Terminator: Salvation, though of course I knew he was a famous actor.\n\nFlash forward to a week or so ago- I've developed my mental health issues and I start weirdly obsessing about this movie. As I've mentioned, I have OCD and autism, both of which can cause obsessive thoughts. I have \"special interests\", a feature common to those on the spectrum, where I become completely engulfed in a specific topic to the point of constantly talking about it. I also have developed an eating disorder at this point, which means that I have a preoccupation with being thin. Plus, I had recently seen American Psycho and absolutely loved it. (Yes, you read that correctly, I actually first saw The Machinist before I saw American Psycho.) Enter my new special interest: Christian Bale's illustrious and fascinating acting career. Specifically in relation to The Machinist. Anyway, this new \"special interest\" seems perfectly tailored for my other obsessions, particularly my eating disorder. An eating disorder is a form of addiction, and seeing an extremely emaciated man is like crack for my eating disorder. (For this reason, Dallas Buyers Club is also triggering for my eating disorder, and I'm sure there are other examples, but none come to mind.) For some reason seeing thin women (like in Black Swan or To the Bone) doesn't do the same thing for me. So The Machinist starts luring me back into its clutches. I read more about (and watch clips from) Christian Bale's insanely devoted method acting career (apparently, he actually ate maggots and worms for Rescue Dawn, in addition to losing weight. Now that's dedication! Also, he even did interviews with an American accent after Batman Begins so that people wouldn't get confused when they heard his Welsh accent). And then I start obsessing about all the details of the Machinist, from the diet Bale went on of coffee, an apple, and a can of tuna (don't want to brag, but I've lived on less than that) to achieve his skeletal look to the writer of this film's own obsession with Nine Inch Nails.\n\nSo I finally try to complete my obsession with this film by writing a review. And that leads me to the very review you're reading- which, as I'm sure you've probably noticed hasn't gotten to actually reviewing the movie yet. But believe me, I'm getting there. One thing I wonder about Christian Bale is how his metabolism is probably screwed to hell by now, and when he gets old he probably isn't going to be able to yoyo diet the way he's done his whole adult acting career. Also, I wonder if he has any sense of identity considering how invested he gets in these characters. Apparently he's a douche- he yelled at the DP on Terminator: Salvation (which was a crap movie anyway) and claimed he was too much into the character of John Connor, which just makes me laugh. Whether or not this actually was the case, it's not an excuse to yell at people. And according to his family, he commonly has outbursts. But honestly, I don't care how much of a dick he is because I don't know him and he is only relevant to my life through movies, so I don't need to care about who he is as a person. Anyway, he reminds me a lot of Robert Downey Jr.'s character Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder, and his character-within-a-character of a black stereotype. (Downey Jr. is apparently himself a method actor, although not as extreme as Bale, Daniel Day-Lewis, Robert DeNiro, etc.). Specifically when Lazarus gets confused, asking \"who am I?\" and tearing off his costume. I wonder if Bale's ever had a moment where he's so into a character he forgets who he is. Or maybe not. I mean, he's Christian Bale, and that's a pretty awesome state to be in, both physically and fame-and-fortune-wise. But I doubt how long he'll be able to keep his good looks with the hell he's put his body through, especially as he gets older. But who knows- people still find Keanu Reeves attractive, and he's in his 50s with an awful beard, so beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I guess.\n\nBack to the actual flipping movie. There are some parts of it that are really well done, brilliant in fact. And then there are some things that just fall flat and made me unimpressed when I saw this film the first few times around. I'll list what worked IMO and what didn't, and then get into spoilers.\n\nWhat worked:\n\nThe lighting/atmosphere. Oh my god, I did not expect the lighting to be so well coordinated and brilliant. The blue wash over a world defined by shadows and bright lights were worth the price of admission. It's probably the best lighting I've seen in a movie, besides Mandy's red wash and The Matrix's green wash. It really adds to the confused and paranoid atmosphere of this movie. Similar to David Lynch's Eraserhead (which I hate to compare it to as people already have and Eraserhead is a far better movie than this one), in which sound was its own character in the movie, so it is here for lighting. Though I don't particularly like the works of Brad Anderson (Transsiberian was boring and Session 9 was awful), I have to give props to him, the DP (hopefully Bale didn't yell at him too), and whoever else was in charge of the lighting. Some people called it too \"artsy\", but I really thought the lighting was the best part of the film.\n\nThe little details that lead to the conclusion of this movie: Again I have to give props to Anderson and the writer for making so many details pay off. That principle (Chekov's Gun) is a defining feature of good film and TV. It's the same with most psychological thrillers, Fight Club is a great example (Fight Club is for sure my favorite film in this genre).\n\nThe acting. Jennifer Jason Leigh does well in her role as a prostitute with a heart of gold (again), the actress who plays Maria does well also. (I can't remember the name of the actress who plays Maria as she has a foreign name as she is Spanish, though most of the actors are British or American, some of the minor talent was recruited from Spain, the film was shot in Spain as well and produced by a Spanish producer (this seems to be a common thread in Brad Anderson films)). Bale in the titular role... I don't know how I feel about it. He's much more sedate than he is in American Psycho, which makes sense considering he's a completely different character (or maybe not, I mean they're both mentally ill, dark, brooding characters), but sometimes he sounds like he's channeling his inner Keanu with how whispery his voice is. (I know I've mentioned Keanu twice now, maybe because I just saw Toy Story 4), and other times he's screaming his ass off in pure paranoia. He's much better in the latter situations. He really comes across as a tortured and pained person. I guess that makes up for his sedate nature in other parts of the film.\n\nThe weight loss gimmick. Surprisingly this worked even though it doesn't make complete sense (and I will get into that later), seeing Reznik in an emaciated state makes you understand how sick he is, both mentally and physically. Seeing Bale waste away on camera makes you invested in the movie and concerned for his health- I was seriously surprised he was basically fine and back to normal after Batman. It also makes Bale completely unrecognizable- had I not known it was Bale, I would have had no idea who the actor is (though with the facial hair, he does look like the somewhat skinnier Edward Norton). However, as I said, it is also fuel for my eating disorder and makes me want to starve myself, so it's best I stay clear of this movie. \n\nOn the topic of weight loss and restrictive diets, how Bale managed to maintain himself at such a low weight/on so few calories is a mystery to me. I've spent a lot of time researching the effects of anorexia/starving yourself, and at least from what was reported on IMDb, Bale had none of them. He wasn't fainting all over the place (as I have even after a few days of restricting), he didn't have heart or stomach problems, his hair wasn't falling out, yet he is obviously skinnier than most anorexics are, probably. Apparently doctors told him he might die if he lost any more weight, but how was he not already on the way there? Either he was getting enough nutrients not to have these side effects, or he had them and just didn't report them.\n\nThat said, did Bale really have to lose that much weight? Apparently, the role was intended for a 5'6\" actor weighing 120 pounds (e.g. skinny but normal BMI), not a 6' Bale weighing 110 pounds. But Bale lost the weight anyway, simply because he could. And it works, especially the way it's incorporated into the script. One thing I noticed that was interesting is the way his coworkers reacted to his thinness, often asking if he was on drugs. If it were a woman who appeared that thin, they'd probably ask if she were anorexic. Neither of these are the cost of Trevor's thinness, but it's interesting to see the differences in what people suspect based on gender.\n\nThe mental health representation: The representation of insomnia, OCD, and paranoia/schizophrenia was really well done and ties in to his guilt. I have OCD and schizoaffective disorder, and Bale's performance in combination with how the mental health issues are shown really worked for me, again highlighting how disturbed Reznik is.\n\nWhat didn't work (SPOILERS):\n\nThe main plot twist/ending: This is too derivative of other psychological thrillers, specifically Memento (the fact that he doesn't remember the car crash in which he killed the little boy) and Fight Club (\"Ivan\" is a figment of his imagination). If the writer was able to come up with a more original twist, this movie would be a 9 or a 10 out of 10. I'll talk more about the writer next. I think the predictable plot twist is the reason this film isn't more talked about/remembered. It's also somewhat derivative of Taxi Driver.\n\nThe writing: Some of the writing is so bad and the foreshadowing is so obvious the second time you watch it (especially when Christian Bale says the event he is going to attend \"sounds dreamy\" and then what do you know, it's a dream). It reminded me of Session 9, which makes me wonder if Brad Anderson had the same writer for Session 9. Dreadful, dreadful writing.\n\nReznik's very forgettable (but oddly familiar) name: This is due to the writer being so obsessed with Nine Inch Nails that he named Trevor Reznik after Trent Reznor, the band's frontman. I totally understand this, as a former RATM fan myself, but unfortunately I usually remember Reznik as Christian Bale and not Trevor Reznik. His name just isn't that compelling for a protagonist, I'm sorry. (Apparently the writer also wanted to have a Nine Inch Nails soundtrack, but that's where Anderson stopped him.) Meanwhile, who forgets The Narrator and Tyler Durden?\n\n\"Science\" of Reznik's state: Many things about Reznik's physical state just don't make sense scientifically. Why are his hands not burned from continuous bleaching and lye? How has he not slept in a year if he clearly doesn't have Fatal Familial Insomnia? How did he not already die/lose his mind from lack of sleep? And most importantly, how did his lack of sleep lead to drastic weight loss? He eats normally (although some sites like TvTropes want to claim he's anorexic), so I don't see why he's losing weight. Chronic insomnia leads to the release of cortisol, which causes weight gain, not weight loss. But it is a movie after all- I guess you have to suspend your disbelief.\n\nThe love story angle: I know this is a nitpick, but how could two women (not really, as we find out) possibly fall in love with such an emaciated man, and even have sex with him? (Well, I guess Stevie is paid to do so.) He's just not attractive in any way. Now if he was normal-weight Christian Bale? Maybe so.\n\nOverall, this film could have been amazing if it had come out before Fight Club, etc. or had its own original plot twist. But it doesn't, so that brings my appreciation of it down a notch. That said, I'm still obsessed with it. But that's for me to deal with.",

In this he plays Trevor Reznik, a machinist who has insomnia and hasn't slept for a year. It has one gory scene where Michael Ironside's arm came off at the machine. Trevor apparently has seen two accidents like I said today that Michael Ironside's character had his arm come off and a young boy having a seizure at \"Route 666\". There just loads of things went into his head since he doesn't get enough for a whole year when he has nightmares. It's quite like an ambiguous ending in American Psycho. I really was gripped at the chase scene after Trevor got run over by a car causing a hit and run. This film is so astonishingly psychological it grabs your  attention in order to understand what Christian Bale is going through. It's kinda like Fight Club and Memento which I haven't seen before but those elements go through together in The Machinist for how evocative it is. For how much a gripping psychological thriller it really is. The twist ending is quite depressing but you know how this goes.",
