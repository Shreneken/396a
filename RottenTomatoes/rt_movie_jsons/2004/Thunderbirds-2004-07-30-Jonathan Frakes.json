Somehow they managed to make a film about the International Rescue family without showing hardly any rescuing. They even needed rescuing themselves.\n\nThe film starts off well, for all of 3 minutes. We get a very brief intro sequence showing a standard rescue. Then after heading back to Tracey Island they receive a distress call from Thunderbird 5 prompting all active International Rescue members to head off to help in Thunderbird 3. They are then stranded up in space, and I am not kidding on this one, spend 2/3 of the film trapped in space doing practically nothing. Instead of various rescue missions the filmmakers thought we would prefer to spend the time watching 3 children walking around the island avoiding various dangers. \n\nThe film also commits its biggest sin by not including even one remake of the classic sequence where the pilots are taken to their Thunderbirds via various elaborate chair and escalator rides. \n\nThe Actress and character of Lady Penelope are the films only real strong point as well as the actor and character of Parker. The film at least got them both right. But they alone could not carry this film.\n\nFor some reason the people behind this film decided that they would make a Thunderbirds film while mostly leaving out everything that made the original Thunderbirds series that classic that it was.",

It's not really a Thunderbirds movie (which is a shame, the cartoon reboot shows that one would work) as most of the Tracy clan are relegated to be stranded in space for most of the duration.  The movie itself focuses on Alan and as a result has more of a 'Spy Kids' or Mid '80s kids flick feel.  It's all good fun though and no-one is taking anything too seriously.  My 4 year old Thunderbirds obsessed son loved it and basically wanted to watch it again immediately afterwards so it's clearly pleasing it's target audience.",

I always thought Frakes was a better director than actor.  Some of the best ST:TNG episodes were directed by him.  While I think Frakes did a good job of directing this movie I was disappointed to see that this was meant for a younger audience.  I felt like I was watching something on the Disney channel. The main characters were three kids and the adults had supporting roles. The original characters were pushed into the background and the story centered around the three new younger characters.  I would have preferred to see the original characters as the main focus.",

But Frakes man, you directed my favorite Star Trek film and showed real talent. But this... It looks like Spy Kids, only without the sense of fun. And with worse acting. Honestly, how could the original cast of puppets be better actors than flesh and blood performers? Sure, focusing entirely on three kids separated from your seasoned performers for them to play off of was always going to be dangerous, but these kids are remarkably flat even given the circumstances. While the dreadful script is mostly to blame for that, Frakes has to take some responsibility. The \"martial arts\" scenes would have looked cheesy even in TNG fight scene. Used to working with experienced actors he has no idea how to handle children, and for some reason he manages to screw up the pacing on even the few decent moments the script throws up. Rush rush rush to get to the end. A worthy goal as it happens, but it makes the entire film a real drag.",

            "content": "Grade: High kind of 2/10 if that makes it any better\n\nThunderbirds is an adventure remake of the original TV series of the same name and one that destroys it's legacy and systematically kills it dead. It is an awful reworking and one that is just awful, it is worse than bad and who this was made for I will never know. This movie is obviously aimed at kids and even looking at it that way doesn't make sense, it is offending to the kids as well it is just so terrible.\n\nThe plot is really crazy and kind of a bit haywire, it just jumps a little too much ahead and never slows down to consider what it is doing, that includes the various changes the film has between camera shots with certain clothing changing constantly. Now of course it is a good old adventure, but the case is it is executed terribly, some could find bits here and there where it could be improved but for me this was a lost case within the first 5 minutes and one I will not remember fondly.\n\nThe acting if it even possible is even worse than the story and even the best actors and most experienced can't escape this quagmire of a movie. Brady Corbet our main character Alan Tracy is just awful and is progressively really really annoying to the senses. Big actors like Ben Kingsley and Bill Paxton aren't terrible but still poor and no depth or expertise can they give the roles, not that they can as it is just so badly made. The rest of the cast don't do much to stand out and again I felt with the people involved, it is impossible to impress in such a drab plot.\n\nWhat can I say positively about this, well, the effects used are not so bad for 2004 the year this came out and sometimes you can kind of think very nice. But even with the effects I have a problem as although they are nice, they are way overused at moments and then put in really silly times, it is as if strategic effects are used to then create some kind of disaster waiting to come.\n\nOne lasting hateful thing this movie does is ruin the massive legacy of the old puppet and strings TV series of the 1960's and really shows kids of this day the wrong message, one of silly jokes and silly characters(some of which are completely made up for this movie). I think if you want to respect an old legendary thing then please don't change it because this is altered actually quite a little bit and it could be said too much, the future revamp didn't work and the vehicles are highlights of the randomness this movie brings.\n\nI guess I could say it is well choreographed in the fighting and sometimes it can seem nice, even though some fighting seems overly choreographed so it can be blatantly seen it has just taught to the actor. The title sequence is very nice I'll give it that and the soundtrack from the band Busted is really a big song and one that if played actually in the film as things go on could have drastically improved the kick-ass like factor it sorely needs.\n\nOverall it is terrible and is really really far from being positive, I am equally just as glad this didn't spawn any sequel or with a horrible thought, a franchise. Yes Thunderbirds(2004) is not a good movie and one that although I hope will be remade in the future well, may have to stick to animation to get proper results.",

For those not familiar, it's based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts who use state of the art rockets, spaceships and subs to rescue people from various disasters (falling bridges, stricken planes, burning buildings, etc) each week. Well, the puppets are gone (replaced by far more lifeless teenagers), and so is the premise - only one ineptly staged rescue and a plot shamelessly ripped off from Spy Kids without any signs of imagination, wit or entertainment. Young Alan Tracey feels left out of all the rescuing we never see the other Traceys do because dad won't let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exams. Grounded on a beautiful tropical island (some punishment!), his chance to shine comes when the rest of the family - a bunch of identikit bleach-blondes who look like a gay neo-Nazi boy band without a single bit of characterisation between them - are stranded in space and he has to have the day by, er, running around the jungle, making a phone call, firing a hose at the inept comedy relief villains and dousing them in gunk for bad measure.\n\nThe good points are few and far between. One of them is that the film is mostly in focus. The other is they all got to go to the Seychelles, which looks nice.\n\nThe bad points: where to start? Ben Kingsley's career lowpoint performance? The aforementioned inept comedy relief sidekicks who would disgrace the Children's Film Foundation at its worst? The almost complete lack of action or effects in a $70m sci-fi film? The terrible script, the lifeless direction, the odious moralising? But most of all is the fact that the film is so patronising in every possible way. Forget the life lessons and off the peg sentiment, this is a movie aimed straight at the under-eights by people who know they're making a kid's movie and are constantly talking down to their intended audience, throwing in fifth-rate jokes and routines that would insult most children who had only recently mastered the art of speech. This film could replace being sent to bed early without their dinner as parents' favourite punishment for kids.\n\nThe biggest flop in British film history (it didn't even cover the cost of prints and marketing), it's just about watchable if only as an object lesson in how NOT to make a summer movie.",

Ths film is Aan insult to the original series, and it's fans. They could've at least made a film that the whole family could love, but instead they made a crap film. With it's child oriented humour, the film is a faillure even by child oriented film standards.  This film was amusing, but it wore off, and the fact that they 'reinvented' the look and style of the original series was just wrong. They could have at least try to make a film that the entire family could love, instead they simply made this film for kids, this was honestly a bad move. One of the reasons why is becase the original fans of the series were born in the 60's and grew up watching Thunderbirds, my dad grew up on it, and he made me watch it when I was a kid. Anyhow, the film is terrible because every actor here seems miscast for the part, the story is lame, and the actors are plainly silly. Ben Kingsly was a joke in this film, not even his talent could redeem such a horrid picture. I really was hoping for something terrific on screen. Instead we were given a total joke of a movie. The nostalgic feel of this film is absent. The only good thing that came out of this film is that it will reiinforce the status of the original series more.

Bill Paxton and Ben Kingsley are both class A actors but unfortunately they are given roles of unexciting stereotypes and I don't doubt this movie put a black stain on their record. The kids are just awful, the acting reminds me of a Disney show that has run its course. Couldn't they have spent a little more time on casting and a little less on the visuals?

Many plot elements don't add up (Why is International Rescus so public? Aren't they supposed to be secret?)\r\n\r\nThe best sequences in the movie are the CGI parts.

For a second i was expecting something exiting, entertaining, lively and fun like for example Spy Kids (which i think is a very good family movie) but unfortunately i got the opposite.\r\n\r\nThunderbirds is a thin, extinct children's movie that has nothing good to offer the people over 11 and specially not the parents. Bill Paxton and Ben Kingsley are both class A actors but unfortunately they are given roles of unexciting stereotypes and I don't doubt this movie put a black stain on their record. The kids are just awful, the acting reminds me of a Disney show that has run its course. Couldn't they have spent a little more time on casting and a little less on the visuals? All of them are irritating and plain boring. The movie may have cool visual effects like a Hollywood movie is made to do but the movie never becomes anywhere near mediocre. \r\n\r\nI can imagine the young children under 11 enjoying this but even then it's pretty limited but the rest of us will be checking our clocks every 2 minutes.\r\n\r\n2/10 -- Disappointing to say the least.",

But when the evil Hood and kidnaps most his family, it's up to little Alan and his friends to save the day.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, this movie did suck, but I've seen far worse than this (Catwoman, anyone?).

From start to finish I was presented with bad actors who didn't really seem to understand what they were doing, they had no talent and I just felt that something I was excited about was dying on its arse! Okay some people tried, Ben Kingsley was good but he mainly acted like a pantomime villain, all that was missing was a moustache for easy twirling! I almost wanted to boo and hiss! Mind you by the end of the film I wanted to boo and hiss at the entire film! This film only has 1 and a half stars because of its lavish design but the rest just doesn't deserve credit!

Perhaps it's good for kids, but I think they missed the main audience who would have loved this film. The only good thing was the modernised Thunderbird machines (except that fugly FAB1 Rolls Royce turned Ford/Hydrofoil/Plane). \n\nThunderbirds never centered around one person in particular, but that's what this movie does. The producers turned it into a kids film. They focussed on children, added another child that was never in the series and made the Thunderbirds look like play-toys, right down to the seats, controls and computer read outs. The 'goons' were stupid and unfunny, the fight sequences were overdone with silly sound effects and the distinctive parts of certain characters, like Brains were over-exaggerated to the point of annoyance.\n\n0.5 of a star for the special effects, which by 2011 standards are looking dated as well.

Am now wondering if we coud have waited just bit longer\r\n\r\nRather than go into a full review of the movie I thought I would point out the things they got right and the things they got wrong\r\n\r\nWhat they got Right:\r\n- Lady Penelope and Parker - I thought the actors that portrayed them did a fantastic job, got the characters down pat\r\n- Ben Kingsley was good as The Hood, menacing yet funny, much like the series\r\n- The Thunderbirds Machines - modernised, yet faithful to the original, plus with a good sound system these things (especially T2) will shake the room\r\n- Casting of The Tracy family was fairly shoddy, but I thought they played the characters ok. Brady Corbet who plays Alan played him quite good, only thing being his downfall is that he is one of those guys you just want to beat up\r\n- The Music - the famous countdown is there (there would have been blood on the street if it wasnt), but that song by Busted that plays in the credits is awesome, that song alone improved the entire movie\r\n\r\nWhat they got wrong:\r\n- A lot\r\n- Aimed at kids - considering those that loved the show as a kid would have to be at an average age of 40 why would you make it a kids movie? They should have gone the Spiderman route - aim it at adults, the kids will still love it\r\n- No rolls royce - fair enough on the producers, rolls royce wouldnt let them use the name, so they went the obvious 2nd choice - A Ford Thunderbird - which looked quite cool I must say, but why oh why was there a ford logo in nearly every shot? WAY TOO MUCH ADVERTISING!!!! For a moment i thought the thunderbird machines were gonna have Ford logos on them!\r\n- The cast in general was shocking, a few notable exceptions (see above). They should have got someone with a bit more notoriety than Bill Paxton, nothing against Bill, i think he's a great actor, but someone a bit older would have been better, in fact the Tracy family in general was way to young.\r\n- Big problems with that Fermat guy, whoever thought of him should be severly punished, he is without a doubt the biggest problem with this movie, if they wanted young heros they should have stuck with Tin Tin and Alan.\r\n- Small problem - Brains' stutter is completely stuffed, he sounds like a retard instead of a genius, they should have kept the same stutter that they had in the series (if that makes sense)\r\n\r\nThere is a million other pros and cons about this movie, but I havent got the time or patience to write all of them.\r\n\r\nIn summary, Thunderbirds is an OK movie for kids, and would be a good way to introduce the series to a new generation, but for the true fans it is a let down\r\n\r\nI hope they do a Batman/James Bond and do another film in which this one is completely forgotten about, because it has the potential to be great and Im sure the fans will still want to see it.",

But after seeing it; self-harm never seemed so desirable. Now, a thunderbirds movie, you'd expect would contain one key feature: the thunderbirds. This however was thought unnessercary by the director in favour of 3 rejects from high school musical that nobody cares about. Somehow they can drive the thunderbirds too, hmmm. Who the fuck is alan tracy anyway? wasnt he thunderbird 3's driver? Nope, not anymore. He's an emotionless plank of a child actor who is likely to be assasinated if he is to utter the word 'narley!' one more time. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe girl with him isnt even hot and the other kid looks like the nerdy one from Honey i shrunk the kids. Basically, there is nothing right with this film. Its as if the writer took everything that was thunderbirds and not only shitted on it, but then ate it all up only to shit on it again and again. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is a sequel, it will be presented to us by the four horsemen of the apocalypse as keys to the rapture. But just when you thought you had seen the worst of it, and the credits start to roll; the true horrors of this film are presented to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, its everybodys favorite wannabe rockstars Busted singing another holocaust anthem this time about everyones former favorite TV show. \r\n\r\n\r\nI recall the line from the song 'Aint it cool when spaceships come out the pool'. Now this line sums up how this film was made for me. 100% of the population who watched this show loved it, 80% of those people had the toys and 40% of those had their very own model tracey island and so will know that thunderbird one comes out of the pool and is indeed NOT a spaceship, they are clearly mistaking it for thunderbird 3 which IS a spaceship and comes out of a nearby launch pad. Now this may seem like the nerdiest thing you've ever heard but to the ageing fans of the series is a damn right travisty!\r\n\r\nThe fans of the show were young then and are now older, this film should have been aimed at a more mature age group as it doesnt relate to the youth now as it did back then. Although thinking about it, this film would have been just as shit if it had been released when i was a kid. I would have shitted myself just so i could dip the VHS tape into my nappy before smashing it with my metal optimus prime doll.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarsh i know, but very very fair.",

As far as kids movies go, it is cute and works. However, this film was meant to be an updated remake of a cult classic British show that spawned two films... and it fails in all but the most basic ways. First of all, Thunderbirds referred to the vehicles not necessarily the Tracys who were member of International Rescue, which is never spoken in this version although it does appear at least twice. Also, the ages of the Tracy brothers and their relationships with Lady Penelope and Tin Tin were altered to fit the kid film mold. If you're a fan of the Thunderbirds of old, pass on this sad attempt at a revival...",

Quite bizarrely, though, the only purpose for this belated incarnation seems to have been to get the cult characters out of the way as soon as the plot gets started only to bring them back in the last ten minutes to applaud the actual heroes of the movie, three teens aged 13 to 16 who ¬´ save the day ¬ª despite their age and inexperience, and whose adventures constitute the film itself, which looks like (and may well be, so far as I know) a long advertisement for rides in a Tracy Island theme park produced for some teleshopping  channel.\r\n\r\nAll is not absolutely worthless in the movie. I liked Ron Cook as Parker and Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope, though I think she erred a bit on the Barbie side (both of them are familiar faces to fans of BBC period dramas), and Ben Kingsley seems to have had a great time aiming his broad acting at pre-teens. But I was particularly disgusted at the hijacking of the original concept for the Spy Kids generation, and the fact that the cult puppet show has been turned into a ¬´ hair movie ¬ª, i.e. one of those films in which it is very hard to focus on the actors? faces because your gaze is constantly distracted upwards by the silly, improbable architectures of hair and gel that have been put up on their heads by what must have been at least half of the film crew.",
