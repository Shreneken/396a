    "summary": "This charming account of a period in the life of author J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) reveals the real relationships and events that served as the basis for the author's most iconic work, \"Peter Pan.\" After Barrie develops a platonic relationship with the widowed Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four sons, he is inspired to write a play about a group of children who don't want to grow up. The work proves a hit and winds up bringing Barrie and the children together in a way he had never expected.",

            "content": "I enjoyed this film for the most part - the story it tells, one of 'the story behind the story' so to speak, was interesting and made me wonder about the life of J M Barrie but it is sad at times - sad and sobering.\n\nThe main aspect of this film that I found off putting was Johnny Depp's less than amazing Scottish accent. I hadn't realised the author was Scottish, until it dawned on me that Depp was seemingly attempting a sort of cringey mix of English and Scottish in his accent in this film. It didn't seem entirely believable to me and I'm Scottish!. It would seem unfair to say it ruins the film because his accent isn't great but its still something that came to mind when I was thinking what to say about the film, hence me mentioning it.\n\nHowever, regarding the cast, Kate Winslet does well in her role as Barries wife, Sylvia. Of course she's English, so she doesn't have to try and put on an accent in the same way as Depp had to.\n\nIt depicts an interesting story - a thoughtful and interesting one. My favourite aspect of it was how the parents interacted and tried to relate things to the kids. It isn't a greatly memorable film but its certainly not awful either. Some of the scenes are surprisingly touching, between the children and the parents. I feel it perhaps could have been better in one or two regards but as it is, its certainly worth a watch if your interested in the story.",

            "content": "While far from flawless, Marc Forster's Finding Neverland hits most of the right notes in it's telling of the story of J.M. Barrie's (Johnny Depp) creation of Peter Pan.  Coming off a poorly received play and dealing with a failing marriage, Barrie finds himself immersed in the Davies family, creating a plutonic relationship with widowed mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and a playful rapport with her four sons, using his experiences with the family to cobble together the beloved play Peter Pan.  Like Barrie's work itself, Forster's playful direction (interestingly angled shots, some cool scene transitions) adds to the fun, as do the performances of Depp and Winslet in the lead roles. It does border on saccharine sweet at times and the unnecessary and maudlin final ten minutes feel like they're tacked on to illicit tears, but overall it provides an interesting insight into the creative mind of Barrie.",

            "content": "Of course it takes liberties with the truth, not the first biographical drama to do that, but I cannot deny that Finding Neverland was very magical and affecting and was beautifully crafted not only in visuals but in acting too. Plus it made me believe in Peter Pan again, and that is a wonderful feeling as Peter Pan is one of my all-time favourite stories. The cinematography, costumes, locations and scenery are absolutely stunning, and the score gives the film its magical feeling. The script had its deft touches, the story had a perfect balance of the humorous and the tragic, and director Marc Forster deserves credit for making even those mundane events into something somewhat enchanting. The acting is wonderful too- Johnny Depp is nothing short of magnificent as JM Barrie as he alternates between being playful and sensitive, it was his sensitive side especially that made his performance so good. Kate Winslet is very tender as Sylvia and Dustin Hoffmann impresses in a smaller role. Even the kids were good, especially Freddie Highmore who offers a wonderful portrayal as the serious-minded Peter. In conclusion, beautiful film, very affecting when it needed to be and quite magical to say the least. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Barrie. Let's list off a few of the relatively safe subplots we can get in there - a loveless marriage falling apart, a new relationship blossoming in adversity (including a hovering and strict mother-in-law), and a child reeling from the loss of a parent. There are a couple of moments when the film allows itself to take full advantage of the vibrancy of Barrie's work, including an animated scene of a pirate ship early in the runtime that might instill some hope, but for the most part sticks to plodding period drama. The plot tries to revive itself by hoisting a teary-eyed final act upon you, but it doesn't necessarily land very well; the final shot, where both Depp and Highmore fade out from the shot, makes little sense from a narrative perspective.

            "content": "A heartfelt journey into your imagination and childhood.\n\nMarc Forster's historical romance drama Finding Neverland (2004) brings you back to your childhood loving Peter Pan, believing in fairies, and searching for a purpose in life. Forster's direction is very pretty as he tells the life story of J.M. Barrie as he finds his muse and inspiration for writing his Peter Pan play. Gemma Jackson's production design and Trisha Edwards' set decoration recreates old London with a gentle nostalgia and keen detail. Finding Neverland make me teary eyed with how empathetic it is for those grieving, especially children.\n\nMatt Cheese's editing is very professional and sleek for 106 brief minutes that you are never bored during Finding Neverland. David Magee and Allan Knee's writing is sweet as they find the heart and mindset of a conflicted writer disillusioned with his plays. Magee and Knee also write realistic children that have that playful wonder of a child's perspective. In all, Forster did a great job making Finding Forster genuine, informative, and entertaining.\n\nRoberto Schaefer's cinematography is gorgeous with ethereal lighting and serene wide shots around London and the Neverland set. Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's score is beautiful with a heavenly aura that blankets Finding Neverland with a graceful warmth. Alexandra Bryne's costumes are lovely with pretty sundresses for Radha Mitchell and Kate Winslet with striking suits for Johnny Depp.\n\nJohnny Depp is sympathetic and likable as famed Scottish author and playwright Sir James Matthew Barrie. His Scottish accent is great and fun to hear, but it is Depp's tender portrayal of a man worn out by his loveless marriage and poorly received plays, who learns to love again when he meets a poor widow and her remarkable 4 children. He has a nice rapport with a fierce and affectionate Freddie Highmore. Kate Winslet is excellent and devastating as Sylvia Llewelyn Davies with a sweet chemistry with Johnny Depp. Winslet's eyes say everything she feels. They all carry and elevate this film to greatness.\n\nRadha Mitchell is gorgeous and intriguing as Depp's forlorn wife Mary Ansell Barrie fed up with J.M. Barrie going around with a widow alone. Julie Christie has a severe presence and intense gravitas as Kate Winslet's mother Mrs. Emma du Maurier. Dustin Hoffman has a funny little role as Charles Frohman who financed Barrie's plays. Kate Maberly is a nice Wendy, but Kelly Macdonald's brave and adventurous Peter Pan is amazingly captivating to watch. It was fun to see Mackenzie Crook and Angus Barnett outside of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise too.\n\nIn conclusion, Finding Neverland is a beautiful film for families to enjoy as parents will find a fondness for this story for sure.",

            "content": "When I watch a biopic, I generally find it more engaging if they focus in on a specific time period or event in that person’s life, which is what they attempt with Finding Neverland. This film looks at the time in J.M. Barrie’s career that he was struggling for a hit, and the children he met who led him to create the character of Peter Pan. There’s a high level of charm in the film, and I love all the acting performances. The kids are delightful, and Johnny Depp is appropriately restrained. I only wish Kate Winslet was a more active participant in the story, but for plot reasons she spends a great deal of time on the periphery of the action. It’s one of those movies that pulls on the heartstrings and could elicit a lot of tears for some people. I was able to hold back the waterworks, because I could predict long before it came where the movie was headed, which lessened the emotional blow. The other thing that lessened my emotional reaction is that it gets a bit aggressively manipulative in drawing out the tears. It falls into the realm of “schmaltz” more than once. My other problem with Finding Neverland is that they didn’t do enough to draw correlation between Barrie’s playful bond with the Davies kids, and the story of Peter Pan. I expected to see true inspiration and the blatant connecting threads between the two. I also kind of wanted to see them play more with the magical realism that we see in only one scene. I think it could have been fun to see them swept away in a real-world adventure when they were pretending, so we could see the magic he was seeking to create in the minds of his audiences. I was able to forgive a lot of these plot issues, because they were the fault of my own false expectations, and because I chose to buy into the story being told. Finding Neverland bought so much good will from me, based solely on the tone of the film and the delightful actors, that I found myself ignoring some complaints and going along for the ride. I can’t say that the movie quite took my heart on a flight to Neverland, but at least I managed to enjoy aspects of it, while recognizing that the movie is somewhat flawed.",

            "content": "Watching Johnny Depp on screen is difficult for me as I have grown up seeing him as an abusive husband and an otherwise mentally troubled human being who doesn't have the charm and sex appeal that he would have had to audiences slightly older than I am. He seems an odd fit then to play a delightfully childlike patriarchal figure to four young boys who invents an enchanting story that has inspired children for decades. I have to say that the film never quite grabbed me as it all seemed far too twee and schmaltzy to be truly affecting and I never felt that I really knew these characters or understood their bonds. One of the things about the film that shocked me was it earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture which seemed very odd when considering how milquetoast it is in a year that produced Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and the comedy classic Mean Girls (2004).\n\nLonely playwright J.M. Barrie, Johnny Depp, is excited by the presence of the four young Davies brothers in his life as they inspire him to explore his own imagination and write new plays after having one of his plays fail. His increasing closeness to the boys and their widowed mother Sylvia Llewellyn Davies, Kate Winslet, alarms his neglected social climber wife Mary, Radha Mitchell, and arouses the suspicions of Edwardian society. Barrie's relationship with Davies is further complicated by her connection to her possessive mother Mrs. Emma Du Maurier, Julie Christie, and her life threatening illness. Barrie successfully stages the Peter Pan play, inspired by the boys, and Davies receives a proper send off as Barrie promises to take care of the boys.\n\nSurprisingly the best part of the film was the delightful performance of Winslet who I usually am not partial to. She brings real warmth and a sense of responsibility to the role of free spirited young matriarch and it is a shame that we do not spend more time with her as she is simply enchanting. Comparatively Depp is bland and not engaging in the lead role as you never see what would draw such spirited young men to him and why you would want to center an entire film around a figure so dull. His accent is fine if a tad hammy, he simply can't compare to Maggie Smith in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1969), while his body language doesn't suggest someone comfortable with pretending to be different characters, strange for an actor. The supporting cast are all perfectly fine as Christie gets the opportunity to chew the scenery as an overbearing mother but it's sad to see Dustin Hoffman receive so little to work with.\n\nUnfortunately what are meant to be the most uplifting and inspiring moments in the film, when we see Barrie and the Davies brothers pretending to be swashbucklers and Native Americans, are irksome and tiring. All of these scenes take place in elaborate sets as we cut between reality and the imaginations of these men with the fears and desires of the young boys being represented by crashing waves or elaborate face paintings. I wanted to feel the spark of inspiration that supposedly came from these experiences or at least the joy that the boys derived from these moments but they seemed so artificial and lifeless that I just couldn't believe in the magic of these scenes. So many biopics about events that inspired an artists greatest work, of which there are many, struggle to portray the eureka moments without seeming hokey or cheesy and this film falls firmly in that category.\n\nThe whole film really doesn't stand out to so many others of it's kind as it's period detail isn't very impressive, the performances aren't incredible and the direction is steady but never remarkable. This is sad when considering all of the talented assembled as it should be more fun to see Christie and Winslet play mother and daughter but somehow the energy is sapped out of the film and it ends up being stunningly average. Certainly not a bad film per se but one that is less than the sum of it's parts and not one of the best of 2004.",

            "content": "How fitting for a film based on the inception of Peter Pan to be so enchanting, charming, and just all-around magical. Based itself on the play \"The Man Who Was Peter Pan\", Marc Forster's heavy emphasis on sentimentality and wonder in Finding Neverland will be cloying for some, but it fits this story very well, and even makes certain character moments hit that much harder. The film is anchored by one of Johnny Depp's finest roles in his expansive career (and one of his Oscar nominated performances): here, he ditches the wacky hairstyles and makeup that he's so known for in favor of a sublime and subdued performance, even with his clearly non-native Scottish accent. At a point, Depp completely embodies the loving mannerisms of J.M. Barrie, often to the point of completely losing himself in the role. Depp has a history of playing childlike characters, sometimes to the point of being overblown, but here, it's just the right amount of seriousness and silliness. Alongside him is a charming performance from Kate Winslet, as well as four pretty solid child performances from her onscreen sons: Freddie Highmore in particular is a standout.\n\nAnyone who finds too much sentimentality to be a turn-off won't find Finding Neverland to be anything worthwhile, but those who don't mind a strong heaping of wonder will be completely engrossed in this film's charm, and the ending will truly hit home. Certainly well earning in its Best Picture nomination.",

Finding Neverland is an interesting story about the iconic character and the special relationship J.M Barrie had with a particular family that inspired him to write the story.\n\tScottish playwright J.M Barrie (Johnny Depp) is well known in Britain but unfortunately his last play was a flop and he is in need of something new better. While out with his dog Barrie humorously comes across a single mother (Kate Winslet) and her 4 boys, the Davis family who he successfully entertains on the nice sunny day out in the park. Barrie continues to see the family and forms a special bond with them even Peter who for a good part of the movie hates him as he believes he is trying to replace his father who died. Barrie begins to find inspiration from his time with the boys to create a new imaginative story that would become the one we all know and love. All the while barrie is contending with his wife whos concern and jealousy over his time spent with the Davis's grows. \nIts cute really heartwarming picture. Really nice directing and really brings the imaginative feel that Jm Barrie supplied. Its pretty cool seeing how this man created peter pan and neverland it was all with imagination and chance. Johnny depp is wonderful here. Nailed the Scottish accent and played such a gentle fellow with such a creative mind. He imprinted on a family the power of hope and thinking of positive things. Kate winslet was equally wonderful as this mother who finds a ray of light with Jm Barrie. Well edited and decent visual effects. Its amazing to see how finding neverland became even a real life thing for Barrie and the davis family.\n\tFinding Neverland is beautifully written story that shows an unusual story of how an incredible fictional tale came together. Definitely one for the whole family.",

Kate Winslet may have been a joke in Titanic (like everyone else in that film) but she puts out a stellar performance in this film.\n\nWe also need to mention Freddie Highmore. Holy cats, I worship that kid. He might just be the greatest child actor of all time. Dustin Hoffman is also present in a minor role (which he aces as usual).\n\nThis film is meant to be nostalgic for people who have seen previous version of Peter Pan (whether it be the Mary Martin version of the Disney animated version) and it accomplishes this task perfectly.\n\nI literally was on and off crying the entire last 30 minutes of this film. This is absolute beauty.\n\nSUMMARY: Absolutely marvelous. A must watch for anyone and everyone.",

            "content": "As Finding Neverland boasts a performance from Johnny Depp that scored him an Academy Award nomination as well as Kate Winslet as a cast member, there was too much not to miss out on.\n\nFinding Neverland doesn't seem to feel like a true story, but then again it's been told that the film is only semi-autobiographical and lacks a lot of truths to it by omitting facts and creating an unintentional fictional universe for the film.\nOne issue is that I didn't really believe that the film was set in the very early 1900's because the costumes of the characters didn't seem to embody the timeframe appropriately, and the actual setting has the same effect because the production design and props does not feel like its actually that old when J.M. Barrie's original play Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up was actually written precisely 100 years before Finding Neverland was released. Finding Neverland feels to modern to be convincing.\nAnd the story in Finding Neverland feels too simple. It feels like all the story presents is a case of a man who wrote a bad play and seeked inspiration to write a new one. He then came up with the idea, and wrote the play. End of story. That is the essential plotline in Finding Neverland and I wasn't impressed by it. I found that it was very thin and that therefore the importance rested on the relationships between the characters, but there wasn't really anything I picked up from that either. The only relationship I really picked things up from was the relationship between J.M. Barrie and Peter Llewelyn Davies which was like a child in a mans body engaging with a child who is facing the impending drama of soon becoming a man. While that aspect is interesting, the rest of the film feels like it has a surplus of sweetness which overloads the atmosphere. Basically, Finding Neverland feels too light to ever have actual drama to it and so when it reaches its dramatic climax the effect really isn't felt as much as it should be. Finding Neverland just proves that while fictionalising the story, David Magee forgot to add a touch of realism to his recipe and left it feeling and looking unbelievable. Either the story behind creating Peter Pan and Neverland isn't inspiring to me, or it simply wasn't handled well by David Magee. He did a good job writing the screenplay, but he needed a good story to go with it which just didn't show up in the end.\nAnd so from within its limitations, director Marc Forster does as much as he can. He applies good visuals in other areas, but there is only so far he can go and he does nothing to improve the story or to dramatise the film that well most of the time, leaving it to be the overly light and sweet film it is without any strong drama for almost the entire film. The only time that the drama was really effective was the sad scene at the end of the film, but up until then it had no real success to boast. He succeeds in other areas though.\nThe visual style of Finding Neverland is unforgettable. It brings forth the style of illustration in a classical storybook and turns it into the backdrop for a three-dimensional live action film. It comes to life so beautifully that it creates a lot of life, the kind of life you would only find in Neverland. The colour in Finding Neverland is almost angelic. The lighting brightens things up so much and gives the film the true magical feel that is embodied by the Peter Pan universe, therefore connecting the real world to the fictional one created by the writer that is chronicled in the movie.\nThe cinematography is also excellent since it moves around the world so smoothly, and the musical score is thoroughly beautiful. The musical score is the other angelic touch to the film, and its just terrific.\nThe actors are the most notable aspect of Finding Neverland.\nJohnny Depp is spot on as J. M. Barrie because of how he incorporated in a strong Scottish accent nad his natural charm as an actor into characterising him, and there is no denying that he is a serious success. His presence is a charming one, and he becomes so friendly with characters and audiences that he is practically impossible to dislike. He does a terrific job conveying the nature of the man who created Peter Pan and Neverland, and his charm is something you cannot ignore. Johnny Depp does a great job.\nFreddie Highmore is also incredible in Finding Neverland. In my opinion, he was the true standout in Finding Neverland because even at an age as young as 1 he reveals that he knows what passion in acting is really all about. His dedicated line delivery and unflinching expression of emotions is something that takes normal actors years to achieve, but Freddie Highmore takes no time to do it. Freddie Highmore holds the legacy of being a screen stealer in a Johnny Depp movie, and he should be as proud of that as he is of his incredible talent as an actor at his juvenile age who can deal with such mature drama so finely. \nKate Winslet's performance in Finding Neverland isn't one of her most memorable  and her little screentime decreases her potential impact on the story, but in a basic effort she proves that she is still very talented and charming as an actress, as well as really easy to engage with by other actors. She articulates her line delivery with her physicality very well and it seems really natural, so she projects one of the more realistic elements of the film. Her performance stands out from the crowd as usual, and there is no denying that she gives an effective effort.\nDustin Hoffman was also a charming touch and added some good support to the story.\n\nSo while Finding Neverland is a well acted film with a certain colourful charm to it, the story is fictionalised and feels too much like a lie as well as being genuinely too thin to hold its own film.",

Por sinal, o filme expõe de maneira deliciosa e criativa essa imaginação fértil de seu protagonista, bem como a relação terna e sincera deste com as crianças Davies. Críticas apenas para o desenvolvimento falho da relação entre Barrie e a viúva Davies (a falta de sensibilidade de Barrie em relação a questões mais sérias como o seu próprio casamento também comprometem um pouco a simpatia do público perante a ele).

            "content": "There have been a number of Peter Pan films released over many years.  From the cult classic, \"Hook,\" to Disney's animated adaption, Peter Pan has gotten more than his fair share of publicity.  Disney's Peter Pan has long since been my favorite Neverland adventure put to film, but it seems that it has now been dethroned.  Not only is Finding Neverland an engaging and fascinating film, it's also a magical and enchanting experience.\n\nJ.M. Barrie is trying to get over the poor reception from his last play by writing a new adventure.  To find inspiration, he goes to the park where he meets the Davies, a family of four boys and a widowed mother named Sylvia.  Barrie immediately falls in love with the family.  Most of the boys enjoy playing with Barrie as they use their imagination to become pirates, cowboys, among other things.  Only one of the boys, Peter, refuses to leave reality.  As Barrie slowly opens Peter's mind to the world of imagination, the Davies soon inspire Barrie to discover and develop Neverland.\n\nThis isn't a documentary.  Nor is it a cheesy family drama.  Finding Neverland, like the film's portrayal of J.M. Barrie, is playful, a little eccentric, and intelligent.  It's a family film that avoids all the common pitfalls of it's own kind.  Finding Neverland isn't formulaic, and it doesn't feel the need to pander to kids.  \n\nIn fact, despite it being labeled as a family film, it's unlikely to appeal to children.  It's slower than most family films, lacks action, and while there is humor, it's much more subtle than what children are used to.  \n\nThe visual effects are superb.  As Barrie and the Davie boys explore fantasies, their surroundings change into something of a storybook setting where the children can explore and play.  Editing between real life and their imagination make this more than just a novelty.  It's an innovation, and a true achievement in editing, visuals, and storytelling.\n\nAs Barrie slowly gathers inspiration from his surroundings that will inevitably make up the world of Neverland, we see glimpses of his ideas appear in the real world.  A cranky and tyrannical grandmother with a hook in her hand.  Boys jumping on their beds and flying out windows.  With each inspiration, comes a feeling of magic.  Like seeing the magician at work.\n\nThe acting is very well done.  Johnny Depp, in one of his less bizarre roles, portrays J.M. Barrie with a childlike playfulness and innocence.  While his accent may be a bit off putting (he's supposed to be British, so why does he sound Scottish...?), Depp buries himself in the role, and it's absolutely enchanting.  Freddie Highmore is excellent as Peter Davies, especially considering his age at the time of production.  Kate Winslet is appropriately distraught, but fun loving as Sylvia Davies, and Dustin Hoffman is great in the slightly more humorous role as a play producer that funds Barrie's work, despite his skeptical attitude towards him.\n\nThe score, for which the film won an Oscar for, is composed by Jan A. P. Kaczmarek.  Like the film, it's magical and beautiful, and has an element of playfulness to it.  By absorbing itself into the film, the score enhances the production greatly, and adds to the overall enchantment and wonder.\n\nWhile a film about J.M. Barrie and his inspirations may initially seem more like a homework assignment than a film, Finding Neverland achieves grand heights as a well made and magical production.  It's not quite a masterpiece, but it's not far off.  If nothing else, it's a family film that won't insult the intelligence of it's older films, and that in itself is a rare treat.",

The whole film is a treat, with a combination of human dramatic sequences and fantastic scenes that let us delve into a creative writer's flights of fantasy. Though sometimes its nature seems to lie within the boundaries of the perennial tear jerker, its soul is also revealed as a manifesto for the rejection of maturity and a childish wish to keep dreaming that is also found in Barrie's work.",

I am not a big fan of Kate Winslet, yet I really enjoyed her performance in this film. The fantasy elements are really great, the direction is spot on, the supporting cast is really good. The climax scene in which the Neverland is made artificially from a garden has a lot of realistic feel and visual marvel.

While the movie is child appropriate it isn't especially child friendly, unless they are precocious I think that they may very well bore of it; the movie is really more for adults.  If the kids are interested however they are certainly welcome.  I have no complaints about this film.  Dramas aren't my first preference when it comes to entertainment, but if you like dramas I have to imagine you will love Finding Neverland.  Clean nostalgia evoking thought provoking heartfelt fun.",

I knew it would be good because Johnny Depp can turn a mediocre film into a work of art with his presence and Kate Winslet is indeed one of the greatest actresses of her time. But this film was even better than all that.\n\nYou would never guess that this is screenwriter David Magee's first script. He spins the web of this tale so fluidly that you'll think he has been writing scripts for years. Director Marc Forster, best known for directing Halle Berry in her Oscar winning role in Monster's Ball, makes this film as visually enchanting as it is in depth. The way he puts this film together is part 'Big Fish' part 'Shakespeare in Love' and is 100% magic.\n\nFreddie Highmore as Peter is a stand out and plays a whole range of emotions in a truthful and simple way. Apparently Johnny Depp liked Highmore so much he convinced Tim Burton to cast him as Charlie in the Willy Wonka remake. Finding Neverland is just a really good movie. It is heart warming and makes you want to be a kid again. Fun!",

Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore (Charlie Bucket from Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) both steal the show, and that ending really brings out all of the emotion the film slowly builds.

This film is no exception. I don't usually give plot details in these reviews, but I can see no harm in it this time, there's no chance for spoilers. Simply put, it's about how the playwright, J. M. Barrie, came up with the story for Peter Pan. Some may find it dull and \"uneventful\", but I assure you, it is everything but boring. The movie is interesting, heartfelt, and inspirational. Imagination and growth are huge themes throughout the film, as they should be :] If you're nitpicky about historical accuracy, then yeah, you might have some problems with it. But all I was asking for was a good story, and that's exactly what I got. Yeah, it's a win from me.",

            "content": "A very pleasant family drama. Your heart rate will never increase while watching it, but you will find it enjoyable.\n\nThe story is of J.M. Barrie. He is a struggling playwright who befriends a widow and her family. Over the course of the movie, the family gives Barrie the inspiration for a new play called Peter Pan.\n\nJohnny Depp plays J.M. Barrie in a quite, graceful way. He is a gentleman who is still a kid at heart, and Johnny Depp is brilliant as him. Kate Winslet plays Sylvia, the widow with large family who's health problems get worse and worse. It is another example of Winslet branching out (see also The Holiday). Dustin Hoffman plays Barrie's boss. Its more of a character role, but Hoffman is really good in it. And lastly, Freddie Highmore plays Sylvia's son Peter. Near the end of the movie, there some scenes between Depp and Highmore, and it is just incredible. For a kid so young his acting is so real.\n\nOverall, this movie is very nice. The music is worthy of the Oscar that it won, and provides a wonderful listening experience out of context of the movie, as well as in context. The movie is not revolutionary or incredibly original, but it is pleasant and the performances are wonderful. \n\n\"This is Neverland.\" 7/10",
