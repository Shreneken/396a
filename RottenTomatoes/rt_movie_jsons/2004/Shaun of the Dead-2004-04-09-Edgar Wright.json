Rasmus was the real mvp of the movie. He had the best jokes and even said the n-word. Samuel's imaginary girlfriend was pretty gay at times and she should have died. In my opinion, the best decision in the movie was to go to Tuoppikellari because it's really safe and there are lots of drinks, also Karaokeisäntä is there to show his singing skills. Queen was a good choice for music even though it was cut right when the solo started. The Runnilaiset were pretty realistic but I definitely saw some Kiuruvetisiä in there as well, they are gay. Julius had a small role as well but it wasn't realistic because he was thin. The ending was really good with Samuel and Rasmus playing NBA2k17 with Samuel's Ps4. Sami looked exactly like in real life but his car didn't look like the Mersu. All in all amazing movie but not on par with Scary movie or Mies ja alaston ase.",

It was just awful - thanks mainly to the editing.\n\nThe first half was better than the second half - as by then all the best jokes and situations were already done and it became repetitive. \n\nMaybe if I had seen it when it was first released and was not expecting a comedy horror movie with lots and lots of blood, I might have been one of the audience members who were wowed by it.  \n\nBy the time it had finished - and it isn't a long movie by today's standards - I found it boring and Jo found it complete nonsense - I am being polite as you can gather from what I told you she actually said.",

There is no denying that Shaun of the Dead is a hilarious movie, with Simon Pegg delivering a incredible comedic and heartfelt performanc. It was kind of refreshing, to have a zombie movie, where the zombies arent actual stronger then the humans. The movie really spends a lot of its budget in the 3rd act, this is aswell where almost all the action takes place. I found the 1st act of the movie, something that wasnt for me, however I absolutely loved the 3rd act. Shaun of the Dead has some hilarious scenes, some great emotions and at last, a pretty epic ending!",

I was not expecting certain twists like how Shaun's mother turned into a zombie and him having to eventually kill her, which was actually quite a bit heavy in a movie like this but it mostly balanced out. It was funny toward the end how they even threw in a 28 Days Later reference (which came out a year earlier). Edgar Wright is a very skilled director and while I think that Hot Fuzz is a better movie overall, this certainly had its moments.",

Dawn of the Dead? Day of the Dead? Well for me I consider Shaun of the Dead a classic. This movie has been around most of my life and it not have been like the other serious zombie movies and even though considering this is a comedy it doesn't take away the fact that it is actually a very good and entertaining movie. This is one of the movies that I always watch especially when it's Halloween and the amount of times that I have watched this movie, it will always entertain me no mater the occasion. \n\nThis is actually one of the best zombie movies that there is, you get to see how the zombie apocalypse starts and ends in one movie, there are alot of zombies in this movie and they not easily defeated, there isn't that typical scene so then shooting zombies so easily by guns they just so happen to pick up so easily. But one thing that this movie has is the cinematography, everything is extremely cinematic, even before the zombies attacked there was always something to look at in the background and even the camera works is its so amazing. But one thing I have to mention is how cinematic this movie sounds, the sound is so clear you can everything the people in the background, the sirens that was always playing, the grunts of the zombies, this movie was made a long time ago but imagine hearing all of this in an IMAX theatre, it would have been amazing. The story is really entertaining, not only about the zombie apocalypse but with all the characters aswell, especially with how many left by the end of the movie.",

I love his style of directing with his use a quick camera cuts, gives this movie such a fun fast energy to it  This movie is packed full of jokes at break neck speed while also balancing it with horror. While this is more of a comedy, the danger is very real for the charecters and the zombies are quite deadly. The trasitions between horror and comedy are seamless. I love the how the first act uses foreshadowing and irony to pay off throughout the film. The cast is fantastic and anytime I hear Simon Pegg's name this movie instantly comes to mind. This feels like a love letter to zombie films and it does not skimp out on blood and gore. This is a horror comedy classic that will stand the test of time.",

            "content": "Ok, to be fair, I didn't see the movie this was parodying before I saw this, nor did I even know this was a parody when I saw it. With that being said though: this blows. It's meant to be a comedy, but the choice of music they use, especially leading up to the zombie invasion, gives off a horror vibe not a comedy vibe. Additionally, the vibe I get from some of the characters themselves(mainly Shaun and Ed) is more SAD than funny. I never laughed at any of the jokes, because even though they were, in fact, hilarious, they felt glossed over at best, and out of place at worst. Zombie comedies are absolutely doable(I absolutely love last kids on earth), but the jokes in this one feel out of place despite being the base of this movie, and are in fact funny.\n\nAnd then there's the other aspect, the zombie apocalypse itself. It's legitimately cool to see the zombies spreading, and the characters be unaware of it because they're drunk and don't watch the news. But once they do realize what's going on, these zombies are WEAK. I know zombies are meant to be slow, and that plenty of popular zombie media has them this slow, but it just doesn't make sense, here or in other media, that they'd actually be a threat like this. If they're SO SLOW that you can throw an entire box of records at them while sitting down before they reach you, they'd never be able to spread. The only way they'd be able to infect anyone is if someone had to run through a very large number at once, and zombies this weak would never be able to propagate to those numbers.\n\nThe only kind of idiots to ever die to these zombies... are the idiots in these movies. These guys have absolutely NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE DOING.  They see their friend get bit in the neck after already knowing he was already bit, and then proceed to bring him into the car with them. IF YOU DON'T WANNA KILL YOUR INFECTED FRIEND ATLEAST LEAVE THEM BEHIND OR LOCK THEM IN A ROOM OR SOMETHING, DON'T BRING THEM IN A TIGHT SPACE WITH YOU!\n\nThey have no sense of urgency in dealing with the infected, the only sane people here are considered assholes by the rest of the group. The biggest examples of this is the main character's mother. I get she's an elderly person but like I said earlier, she has ZERO SENSE OF URGENCY. ZERO. And Ed doesn't have his head in the game at all. I get that that's meant to be funny, but in reality it's just infuriating.\n\nOh also this movie has the zombies who, despite being weak as fuck, are literally immortal unless you destroy the brain. Infinite energy, and don't care if you destroy any other organs. This only makes them slightly more threatening considering how slow they are, all it does is violate the laws of physics.\n\n4/10. Bad zombie movie, wrong vibe for a comedy movie.",

The cinematography is innovative and unique, the music just adds to the atmosphere, the screenplay is extraordinarily clever and hilarious and the story is original and well constructed. Another strong asset is the cast, Simon Pegg is just wonderful, and Nick Frost is hilarious. Then we have great actors like Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy who are terrific as Barbara and Phillip.

From a parody film you obvious expect nods to aspects from other films as well as humour, however Edgar Wright goes out of his way to contain much more quality. At the centre of the film the story is shown to be that many people already live like zombies as they are stuck in a day-to-day routine and that when a zombie outbreak strikes, it isn't noticeable at first. Before the outbreak strikes plenty of lines and actions within the film are established and foreshadow what is to come, allowing for certain callbacks post-outbreak which are highlighted in a different way thanks to the events that have taken place.\n\nShaun of the Dead (2004) is more than a great horror comedy, it is one of the best comedies in general, thanks to the continuously great chemistry and relationship of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost which is a recurring theme in Edgar Wright films. The story is funny yet emotional, making for nothing short of an entertaining watch.",

The first half of the film is nothing short of comedy gold, filled with clever dialogue and some great visual gags.  As the action becomes more frenetic over the remainder of the film, the laughs die off significantly and are replaced by high-octane action sequences which, oddly enough, seem to suck some of the life out of the film.

Where Godzilla grappled with post-war Japan's fear of being overshadowed by the west, where Dawn of the Dead bemoaned America's quick slide into faceless consumerism, Shaun tackles the existential gloom of an early adulthood reality check. From the resigned obligation of clocking in at work to the sad discovery that a long relationship persists only for convenience, the painful need to kick a lazy best friend in the ass to the dawning realization that one's parents won't be around forever, it pretty well covers the full gamut of post-college worry. That's some hefty emotional weight for a screwball comedy, but the near-constant presence of chunky, scarlet-drenched zombie wanderers and snappy, life-or-death decisions give us just enough distraction to avoid getting tangled up in all the malaise and self-loathing.\n\nWe're also granted frequent opportunity to laugh until our sides hurt. Shaun represents something of a long-form reunion vehicle for the short-lived (but well-loved) British TV sitcom Spaced, with several actors and creatives happily (if, sometimes, only fleetingly) reunited on the big screen. The film's flippant, sarcastic tone is a perfect successor to that two-season series; clever and witty, replete with effective callbacks and natural, unpredictable setups; gleefully subverting a well-recognized genre while also celebrating it. The casual humor clicks immediately, aided at all the right times by a marvelous, memorable rock soundtrack, while the heartier stuff takes a bit longer to settle but, eventually, swings with just as much force.

The other characters throughout this movie are also great especially Ed (Nick Frost) he's a very hilarious character from start to finish and so is Shaun throughout this movie.\n\nThe chemistry which Shaun and Ed have throughout this movie is honestly great, it's nicely displayed when they're either murdering a bunch of zombies together or just having some banter together in a pub, either way the two of them have got some great chemistry with each other throughout this movie.\n\nFinally, the movie's got some very cleverly done fight scenes but oh my god, they're very brutal, very gory and very bloody but they're amazingly well done. Also, the love interest which Shaun has got for Liz (Kate Ashfield) is built up very well and it's honestly great.\n\nOverall, Shaun Of The Dead is honestly a masterpiece and a half.

            "content": "Edgar Wright's distinct visual comedic style is truly what makes his movies great. As I am beginning to watch every Edgar Wright film, I have only watched Hot Fuzz and Scott Pilgrim. Even from those two movies, it's clear that Edgar Wright truly has a firm grasp on how to visually convey comedy. A movie about zombies lends itself to that style extremely well. There are many moments in Shaun of the Dead that are very distinct from anything I've ever seen before, and that's part of it's charm. Seeing Simon Pegg and Nick Frost run around trying to make it to a bar while killing zombies (in a brilliant over the top way) takes the road trip genre to a new place. One thing that amazes me is his sense of pacing. Edgar Wright makes it so the comedy is quick, sharp, yet easy to understand. And the buildup works. While I can praise the comedy in this film, it seemed like Edgar Wright tried forcing a somewhat serious subplot in, which is in part a portion of the element of parody, but it didn't come off as that. When the more serious portions came up, it seemed out of place and that the scene belonged in a different film. On that note, it should also be noted that sometimes, the acting doesn't completely fit, which is partially because of the dialogue. There are two main types of comedy styles. One option is to represent comedy in the dialogue, but the other option is to use physical visual comedy. All too often, modern films only focus on the dialogue, while not caring about how the film looks. Edgar Wright realizes that visual comedy is extremely represented, yet, at times it feels like he missed opportunities for some funny dialogue. Overall, I truly enjoyed this one. It wasn't anything too great, but it was certainly a fun time, and I'd definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "The only zombie spoof you'll ever need.\n\nEdgar Wright's zombie romantic comedy Shaun of the Dead (2004) is a hilarious spoof on all things within the zombie and romance genres. Writers Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg take on zombie outbreaks, origins, survival strategy, group leadership, relationships, and friendships in Shaun of the Dead. I adore how Shaun of the Dead lets the viewer see how our everyday routine likens our mundane existence to that of the common zombie.\n\nI adore Shaun of the Dead's entire cast of characters. Simon Pegg is relatable as a pathetic loser just trying to get by named Shaun. Pegg establishes himself as both a funny comedian and a compelling leading man in Shaun of the Dead. You'll like his zoned out performance and off hand comments. Simon Pegg kills it in Shaun of the Dead. By the same regard, Nick Frost provides non-stop hilarity as Shaun's best friend and survival partner Ed. Frost's devil-may-care attitude and sarcastic commentary to every scary situation never fails to make me laugh. He plays the perfect supporting man for Pegg. Together, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost culminate into comedy gold and an endearing leading pair.\n\nFurthermore, Kate Ashfield is wonderfully endearing and absolutely lovely as Shaun's girlfriend Liz. Her skeptical and frustrated attitude towards Shaun feels justified and realistic. She is much more than Shaun's love interest as Ashfield delivers a heartfelt performance worthy of a fine romance drama. She is devastating during Shaun and Liz' dinner date at The Winchester pub when Liz declares her desire for more from their relationship. I'm sure every woman watching Shaun of the Dead relates to Liz. Kate Ashfield is the heart and rationale for Shaun of the Dead. Likewise, Lucy Davis is excellent as Dianne. Her basic suggestions are fun throughout Shaun of the Dead, but her best scene is when she admits her love for David in a very touching moment.\n\nSpeaking of whom, Dylan Moran is funny as the obnoxious complainer David. His enraged outburst at The Winchester is too hysterical! Penelope Wilton is sweet as Shaun's mother Barbara. You feel like she genuinely represents every viewer's mother in any tender scene Wilton shares with Simon Pegg. I have to mention Bill Nighy's step-father to Shaun named Phillip is just brilliant. Nighy is stern as the overbearing step-father, while sympathetically moving during his send-off to Shaun. You hate saying goodbye to Bill Nighy, but he delivers some of Shaun of the Dead's acting. Otherwise, Peter Serafinowicz, Rafe Spall, Jessica Hynes, and Martin Freeman all have neat supporting roles or cameos in Shaun of the Dead.\n\nOutright hilarious and ridiculous, Wright and Pegg's dry, clever British humor is witty and thoughtful. Wright even gives the audience emotional moments to create a sense of realism to the silliness of the zombie apocalypse. There is so much detail in every choice word, setup and payoff, as well as repeated phrases for exponentially increasingly laughter. Shaun of the Dead is endlessly re-watchable and impeccably written at only a brief 99 minutes long!\n\nEdgar Wright's direction is immaculate with his hard driven style and easy going attitude that makes Shaun of the Dead feel like you are just hanging out with friends trying to survive together. His directorial style is immediately established within Shaun of the Dead's frantic pacing and sarcastic tone. Every scene has excellent jokes and you just keep laughing from Wright's camera choices. Shaun of the Dead is simply Edgar Wright's finest film and one of cinema's cleverest comedies.\n\nDavid M. Dunlap's cinematography frames characters as slack-jawed losers akin to lethargic zombies in every mid shot panning up slowly for a really funny effect. I enjoy the long tracking shots down roads as well as the fast whip pans back and forth during the zombie attacks. Shaun of the Dead is not just well filmed, but done so to efficiently shoot the movie with as fast a pace as possible. \n\nChris Dickens' editing is now a trademark of Edgar Wright films with hyper fast edits cut so lightning fast that you are never bored by shots held too long. Normally rapid fire jump cuts would be disorienting and annoying, but within the context of a Wright film, Dickens' editing is genius and masterful. Characters will mention something, then you see it in the next shot or someone else will finish the sentence with the same shot. The image matching is as impressive as the machine gun speed montages of little character actions that signify you are watching a Wright movie.\n\nI love the alternative rock, indie rock, and punk rock soundtrack. Dan Mudford and Pete Woodhead's score is frenetic and energizes Shaun of the Dead with their riotous cacophony of rock. Marcus Rowland and Karen Wakefield's production design allows you to believe you are witnessing real British homes that look lived in on screen. Similarly, Annie Hardinge's costumes look like real outfits people wore in 2004. The casual costumes only help Shaun of the Dead feel more realistic and relatable.\n\nI should mention the zombies are so fun in Shaun of the Dead because they are so slow and easily dispatched. Candice Banks' make-up is realistic and gory with a look to her zombies that seems natural. For a comedy, Wright's crew put their heart and soul into Shaun of the Dead.\n\nIn conclusion, Shaun of the Dead is the greatest horror-comedy ever with Edgar Wright's innovative direction steamrolling over zombies like they are just cornettos.",

The film also has some really strong costume and makeup design.\n\nThe film in my opinion also has a really good style from the colour design to the tone of the film.\n\nThe practical and special effects are done really well especially for the budget of the film.\n \nThe film also has some very sound action from the look to the way it's directed.\n\nLike most of Edgar Wright's films the editing is very strong and really works with the film.\n\nThe film also has some music which I felt worked with the film.

Pegg has a way of keeping you guessing from one scene to the next. Just when you think you can figure his character out, he evolves just a little bit, enough to remain interesting.

Itï¿ 1/2(TM)s just as gory and in-your-face as any zombie movie Iï¿ 1/2(TM)ve seen, but sometimes those same scenes will have you cracking up. It was very cool how they capture the graduation of the first twenty-four hours. It started with a couple of one-off strange incidents. Before long, the streets were swarming and things were out of control. Very well-done.\n\nConflict: 10\nZombie films/shows should never be about the zombies, but about survival and the reality of the human spirit. You wanna find out who you really are? Get thrown into the middle of an apocalypse. Shaun of the Dead takes the nature of the human spirit and fleshes it out over the course of the film. Some people see tragedy and they run from it while others, like Shaun, take the bull by the horns and go right at it. The conflict succeeds in the group not just taking on the zombies but handling their internal squabbles as well.\n\nGenre: 6\n\nMemorability: 7\nThere were a number of funny, memorable events that stick out. I wonï¿ 1/2(TM)t ruin them, but my personal favorite was the car scene where seven survivors had to squeeze into a little sedan. The hilarity that ensues as they move from Point A to B is pretty awesome. There is also a touching moment within that same scene that adds emotional power to the movie. There are a number of scenes like this here, scenes that can make you laugh and make you feel at the same time.\n\nPace: 10\n\nPlot: 10\n\nResolution: 7\n\nOverall: 83\nShaun of the Dead  is one of those movies where you fall in love with it more and more the more times you revisit it.

Spassoso, divertentissimo, coinvolgente e tanti altri aggettivi possono essere utilizzati per descrivere questo film. I protagonisti sono interpretati da Simon Pegg, che ha scritto la sceneggiatura insieme al regista, e Nick Fros, rispettivamente nei panni di Shaun ed Ed, due fannulloni che si ritrovano coinvolti in un'apocalisse zombi. La cosa interessante, soprattutto essendo una commedia, è la critica potentissima di cui il film si fa promotore, una critica che troviamo anche nelle pellicole di Romero ma qui è ancora più forte; noi è quasi come se fossimo già degli zombi, dei morti, con la nostra routine e le nostre abitudini, facciamo sempre le stesse cose e non ci rendiamo conto nemmeno di quello che ci accade intorno. Infatti ci sono due piani sequenza ad inizio film in cui il protagonista esce di casa, attraversa la strada, entra in un supermercato e ritorna nell'abitazione; uno dei piani sequenza è poco prima dell'apocalisse, in un giorno normale, l'altro è appena è iniziata e in entrambi i casi Shaun fa sempre le stesse cose, non si rende nemmeno conto che attorno a lui ci sono cadaveri e morti che camminano. La regia e il montaggio mi son piaciuti tantissimo, ci sono infatti dei cambi di inquadratura velocissimi che ho apprezzato molto; i due attori principali insieme formano una coppia spassosissima e perfetta. Gran bel film, da vedere assolutamente.",

It's just disgusting, it's not right. I realize this was early 2000s, but even so, this is wrong. Edgar Wright, Nick Frost, please don't do this anymore.\n\nAnyway, I've enjoyed the two Edgar Wright movies I've watched, so I thought I might get into the Cornetto trilogy. And while I don't usually like zombie movies, Shaun of the Dead I liked immensely. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are two very funny actors who I have admired for years, and to see them together is just a joy. Two morally corrupt(I'm just going to say that because Nick Frost's character, Ed, says the n-word so casually) characters are having crises of their own, when a zombie apocalypse strikes and they suddenly have to fend for themselves and their loved ones.\n\nShaun of the Dead contains so many funny jokes and creative gags, it's hard to keep track. The Batman vinyl album, the intentional car crash just to get the slick-looking car, Shaun and his girlfriend having a row, I enjoyed them all. Of course, Edgar Wright is great with visual jokes, and it astounded me how much precision and care obviously went into certain shots(Shaun's daily routine being repeated with identical camera movements). Even in the comical madness, the emotional moments really felt like they mattered.\n\nI'd also like to compliment how this movie dealt with the \"aftermaths\" of a zombie apocalypse, and Wright didn't hesitate to make another dab at contemporary society. We see zombies being used as manual labor workers and objects of sport. We see humanity at their barest in the most satirical way. And that's really hard to find in any zombie material, so I give Shaun of the Dead kudos for that. I just love this movie. I just hope it didn't do the n-word.",

Maybe it's because I'm more used to gunplay in a zombie movie and never found the use of melee weapons to be my thing. Yet I was never NOT entertained by Shaun of the Dead. With the humorous moments, the look at what the British would likely do in a zombie apocalypse according to Edgar Wright who's British so ha-ha, he can't be racist against Englishmen. The makeup effects for the zombies are quite good (I've been a sucker for makeup effects a lot recently) and it does a good job establishing the directorial traits Wright would become known for such as describing plans while the audience gets the visual look of this plan, the scene transitions and the movie becoming a full-on action film by the third act. Yeah, these are perhaps based off of what I saw in Ant-Man (which isn't a Wright film but still has some things that respect his vision for the character), Baby Driver and Scott Pilgrim but from the CinemaWins videos for the latter two, this seems to be his style as a director. Shaun of the Dead is a good, albeit overrated, start to the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy.",

I always find that Wright's work is always very visually stylistic which I tend to find makes even those who aren't massively into film, still find it a very interesting watch.\n\nThe comedy is prevalent throughout and is always perfectly timed and delivered by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. In many films that try to appeal to the mature audience, while also including humour that could be appreciated by a younger viewer, tends to have tonal issues. Although, I feel that Shaun of the Dead has that balanced perfectly, providing some great laugh-out-loud moments, without taking away the mature feel of the film.\n\nThe screenplay is expertly written. I find in some films that a character will say something that to me, doesn't feel quite natural; which then takes me out of the experience and all of a sudden, the remainder of the film feels like a film. One aspect of filmmaking being an art is that you're able to captivate an audience and take them out of the current world they're in and take them into a completely different universe. For me, Shaun of the Dead never has a moment like this. The witty dialogue always flows naturally in each conversation, while still being able to still have great one-liners and moments, without sounding forced.\n\nAnother aspect that excels, present in all Wright films, is the use of editing and how it not only adds comedic value but conveys the narrative to the audience. The aforementioned montage sequences are very useful in getting a lot of information across without taking up much screen time at all. The way we transition from scene to scene is very effective, while being very obvious (by using extreme close-ups and exaggerated sound, such as the door of The Winchester) it is almost invisible for those who aren't specifically looking for it.\n\nThe only real issue that I have is that the third act is very much what I would expect to see in a generic monster film; a group of people holding down a building trying to fight of the monster. I feel, even though it is an adequate ending to the film, the expectation that the previous two acts had built up, I wanted to see a finale that was more unique and memorable. However, the only reason I have this issue is because of the sheer quality of the entire film, please don't misinterpret what i'm saying, the ending isn't bad at all, just not the direction I would have liked to have seen the film go in.\n\nThat being said, the film is amazing and was one of the first \"horror-type\" films I watched as a terrified nine year old, so this has always had a place in my heart.",

Excited, \"Shaun of the Dead\" was first up. In today's world, zombies have become such a prevalent thing in our media and entertainment to the point where they've become a generic concept. Now you can have entertaining zombie pieces, but you'll have to stretch further out than normal. With this film, it was definitely a fun zombie flick. I think it was shot really well and I had a ton of fun with it, even if it wasn't die hard funny. If anything, it was definitely a fun time. \n\nOne thing that was great about this film was the cinematography. I thought the camerawork was so fantastic. It was able to tell the story and help progress the narrative without ever using any straight forward dialogue. I think that's a really valuable thing to recognize, especially since film is a lot of visual storytelling. It was something that made this zombie film stand out against other zombie films, which is really valuable. When you think of zombie films, this film does a good job of putting itself at the top of that conversation just through its unique aspects alone. \n\nI thought this film had solid character depth, but nothing that'll blow you away. It's a comedy first, story second. I think there were plenty of chuckle worthy moments and I was able to have fun throughout the entire thing. I don't think this is the funniest film I've ever seen but it wasn't unfunny. Take that for what is is, but that's my honest opinion on this film and its humor. \n\nI think the writing was solid and as one of Edgar Wright's first films, it was really impressive. To see where he was in his roots and recognize the fact that he hasn't lost that touch today is awe inspiring. I think he's a great and artistic filmmaker. Even though I didn't love this film I definitely had a good time with it.\n\nIn the end, I thought this was a solid movie and a fun zombie flick. It was well made, fast paced, and comedic. I do recommend this film for people who haven't seen any of Edgar Wright's work, or fans of zombie flicks in general.",

Shaun is an everyday nobody that just wants the best for his relationship with Lizzy, meanwhile a zombie apocalypse has infected the local English suburbs. That plot may sound typical and bland but fortunately Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg understood that British comedy would put the premise in a world of it's own. I think that if this film wasn't such a rib tickling comedy it would lose itself in the sheer quantity of zombie horrors at the time. It has can have entertainment value for nearly every movie goer such as gore fest horror fanatics, comedy cravers and romantic silver tonged devils. And if that doesn't appeal to you then there is of course the ravishing Kate Ashfield as Liz. It isn't perfect though, the CGI makes the blood look too comic and slapstick and the film felt a little too short, I'm sure they could of expanded on Shaun as a character and his life as a whole. Overall it's a funny British classic and the perfect marriage of horror and comedy.",

Combining gore and guffaws, brains and braaaaaaains, Shaun of the Dead is a film so original that it formed the basis for the rom-zom-com genre and, by some stretch, thrust zombies into pop culture. Shaun of the Dead saw the British comedy team of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright bring their talents for writing likable losers and innovative genre spins to the big screen. The results are hilarity and dismemberment with a dash of social expose thrown in as Shaun and his bro-mate Ed try to save those they love amidst a zombie apocalypse. Their plans are persistently terrible, their weapons of choice bizarrely selective, the comedy is dark as hell, their leadership is all messed up and those beers aren't going to drink themselves. America's shameless, heartless and humorless rip-offs have stripped the formula that made Shaun of the Dead so appealing, but all that does is solidify this sublimely effective contrast of tea-making and zombie mayhem as a certified slice of fried gold.",

'Shaun of the Dead' is definitely one of those things, as first and foremost it's one hell of a quirky, self-aware and satyrical take on the zombie apocalypse that will have you grinning from ear to ear from start to finish. The humour is very smart, but what takes this film up a level is the intellegence of everything else. Yes the genious who is Edgar Wright not only packs this film with plenty of inventive action and masterfully-built tension, he also deals with some great ideas in a brilliantly unique way; visually, through the tight script, as well as with two great characters who are protrayed extremelly well by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. In the end, this could have been a hilarious satire on it's own, but because of how clever it is, it's something far more. You could easily go as far as saying it's a satire of humanity itself.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Like any good artist, Wright does take his madness a little too far at times. This is particularly the case in that lengthly third act...\nVERDICT: A film that could probably stand on it's own as a satire, or as a serious zombie drama; 'Shuan of the Dead' is a great movie in more ways than one.",

But Shaun of the Dead is just too dang fun and filled with cliché bending humor that Wright's style proves to be the best thing about this Horror-Comedy.\n\nThe first of the Cornetto or \"Three Flavor's\" trilogy focuses on a world in the midst of a zombie outbreak, and two loser friends who don't really do anything with their lives.  Buddies Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play the duo, and brilliantly so.  I much preferred their bro-mance to the romance between Pegg and Kate Ashfield, who plays his girlfriend Liz.  \n\nThe enjoyment here is clearly with the fact that if a zombie outbreak ever did happen, I would act exactly how these characters did.  I don't watch the news and rarely care to people watch when running to the store, so I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't realize there was a Zombie-apocalypse going on either.  Or even the gag where Pegg struggles to shoot a shotgun.  These are all real-life scenarios put into a horror film, and thus the comedy works better than expected.\n\nIt doesn't feature an Oscar winning script or world class actors, but it is loads of fun with a kicka** soundtrack paired with amazingly timed physical gags.  Shaun of the Dead was and always will be a refreshing take on the Zombie sub-genre of horror.\n\n+Soundtrack\n\n+The laughs hit\n\n+Relatable lead characters\n\n7.9/10",

WITH ZOMBIES.\nHello Kiddies your pal the crypt-critic here with a horror movie so great you'll die laughing. This is the beginning of my marathon with Edgar Wrights Cornetto trilogy but the end of Hoop-tober. Either way grab a pint and a cornetto.\nThere comes a day in every man's life when he has to get off the couch...and kill some zombies.When flesh-eating aombies are on the hunt for a bite to eat,it's up to slacker Shaun(Simon Pegg) and his best pal Ed(Nick Frost) to save their friends and family from becoming the next entree.\nWe all know about the classic zombie films like night of the living dead,dawn of the dead etc. But this is one of the few films to not only satirize zombie films but also somehow stay faithful to them,this British comedy stars Simon Pegg as a lazy absent-minded Shaun with his even more lazy and absent-minded friend Ed played by Nick Frost. When the zombie apocalypse happens however they turn into two unlikely heroes fighting zombies and get laid all at the same time.\nMost are so familiar with this it's hard for me to talk about it. This film is a great start for a great trilogy and a lot of fun so grab a pint and a cornetto and enjoy Shaun of the dead for Halloween I give it a four out of five.",

After a bad day ends with a wild night at the bars, Shaun and Ed wake up to find the world infested with zombies, and they join forces with others to overcome the threat.\n\nThis British film is a bloody good time, mates. The dialogue is quick and witty, the chemistry is strong (especially between Pegg and Frost), and the film delivers both in an action and comedic sense. Even the morbid ending had some humor! Edgar Wright has always been a solid filmmaker, and this first installment in the \"Cornetto Trilogy\" stands as his rise to fame. His cinematography is very solid here as well;  the sequences without any cuts to a second or third camera really stand out, especially when it comes to watching Shaun's two trips to the mart - one when everything is boring and fine, and another the morning of the zombie infestation. The editing (or lack thereof) really shines through the muck of zombie guts.\n\nFor a comedy, there's a lot of heart to this movie as well. The character development of Shaun and company really hits home, and there are some interactions that really tug at the heartstrings (Shaun and his step-dad's exchange in particular stood out). Of course, this lends to the theme of dead and lifeless creatures resulting in Shaun \"coming to life\" in a sense, but that's a pretty easy idea to spot. The action isn't horrible here, either. There's a scene in the bar involving Queen's \"Don't Stop Me Now\" that I'll always cherish as cinema gold in a hysterical way.\n\nFolks, if you miss the days when comedies weren't super-delayed sequels nobody asked for, go give Shaun of the Dead a watch. It's slow at first (rightfully so), but you'll be in love with these characters come the end credits.\n\nFinal grade: A-",

            "content": "Blending the genres of horror and comedy together is done well on occasion, but more often it is done poorly, especially when you look at the \"Scary Movie\" franchise which parodies contemporary horror films by referencing them directly and making surface level jokes out of the situations. Luckily, with Shaun of the Dead, we get an intelligent comedy which is original in style and clever with its treatment of a zombie outbreak.\n\nWe all know the concept of the zombie movie. A curse, or a sickness, or radioactivity etc. causes the dead to \"live again\" to feed on the flesh and brains of living human beings. Most of the time they are slow walkers which is the case of Shaun of the Dead. Wright takes this concept and makes comparisons between the outbreak and normal life for Shaun. A motif shot used in the film focuses on Shaun slowly getting out of bed in the morning, walking in a zombie-like fashion towards the door while yawning in a way very similar to the noise zombies tend to make. The average working-class man is like a zombie in a swarm: lazy, conforming to and blending in with the rest of the swarm, and insignificant compared to the swarm as a whole.\n\n2 long takes that are done early in the film also compare society in a normal universe to one filled with zombies. Shaun is nonchalant in both of these sequences when he walks to a convenience store to buy a few items - he does not notice the difference, but in the first sequence he interacts with people a little more than in the second, but it seems that he really does not care about his surroundings too much, even though they change drastically in the second sequence when the zombie outbreak has already begun.\n\nWhile this is a zombie movie and is gruesome at some moments with guts and blood, the zombie violence seems more cartoonish than disturbing. The comedy in this movie outweighs the horror in this film in every fashion, including the violence.\n\nThis film is solid on pacing and editing. While it seems to have an average pace at first, it really picks up once the zombies become a problem in the film. The editing is really interesting, making simple actions feel intense by using quick cuts between closeups which force us into the \"action.\" Wright also has an interesting way of putting action scenes in sync exactly to the music in the background. In fact, a scene involving action to the rhythm of a song by Queen proves to be on of the best in the film.\n\nThe story itself could be a little more interesting to be honest. We never get a thorough explanation of what causes the zombie outbreak, though this film does not feel like it needs one. The story revolving around Shaun and his friends and family is very straightforward - Shaun goes through a breakup early on, but tries to become a hero for his ex and for his family once he realizes the scale of the situation.\n\nGood comedy and a few unexpectedly well-done dramatic moments make this film enjoyable to watch.\n\n3.0/4.0",

Its your basic zombie apocalypse plot and it does no wrong. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are hilarious. I can't see any other actors in this movie because the play the parts so well. The constant banter between the two and situations they get into are really funny. Another nice thing about the movie is that it is well paced and has the perfect run time. The best thing about the film is how it balances the gore and comedy. There's a bunch of fun smashing, killing, and run away scenes for everyone to enjoy. Overall Shaun of the Dead is a fun movie to watch. Is it the best comedy out there or most original story? No, but its what the film does to make it funnier and different from the rest that make Shaun of the Dead a classic.",

Nick Frost is funny also and so are the supporting cast too.

There are numerous numbers of zombie movies recently, but this movie, \"Shaun of the Dead\" is the best and craziest zombie movie in the world.\n\n \"Shaun of the Dead\" is a comedy zombie movie which is rare in zombie movie industry. The earliest comedy style zombie movie was \"The Return of the Living Dead\" whose title is a parody of \"Night of the Living Dead\" directed by zombie movies' God Father: George. A. Romero. \"The Return of the Living Dead\" is whole about comedy and have a lot of funny scenes, but on the contrary, \"Shaun of the Dead\" is a combination style of comedy and horror. It consists of, of course, a lot of fantastic scenes which make us laugh and also a bunch of serious and terrifying scenes. This style is the outstanding characteristic of this movie. Taking examples, the scene main characters are fighting with zombies with Queen's \"Don't stop me now\" is the most laughable and fantastic scene in zombie movies, and meanwhile, the scene one of the main character is turning to one of them (zombies) is touching and affecting. This kind of combination was so rare at the time \"Shawn of the Dead\" was released. A lot of comedy style zombie movies have been filmed because of this major league class hit of \"Shawn of the Dead\".\n\n One another point that makes this movie better one is there are no super hero type characters in this movie. Fantastic hero always makes a horror movie terrible and time wasting one, for example, \"Resident Evil\" series. In this series, the main character, Alice, got stronger and stronger as the episodes went on. As she became more like a super hero, the movie itself became more predictable and tiring one. Completely opposite to \"Resident Evil\", \"Shaun of the Dead\" doesn't have any hero type macho characters. (Though Shaun wanted to be a macho captain, he couldn't.) \n\nThis movie is still great one for zombie fans was proved by the fact George admitted this movie was amazing and there had been no zombie movies like this. Though the remake version of \"Dawn of the Dead\"was released in the same year of \"Shawn of the Dead\", he strongly suggested that \"Shaun of the Dead\" was far much better than the trash remake movie whose original one is George's most famous and incredible zombie movie.\n If I had to cite one unfavorable point in this movie, that would be the last 10 minutes of the movie. That's too sudden that armed civilians attacked zombies by shooting many guns and killed all of the zombies on the street. It could have been better if it had had another better ending.\n\n Still, this movie is extraordinary exciting and showed a new possibility that zombie movies will evolve into a new entertainment.  The new age of the Living Dead has come.",

            "content": "Shaun of the Dead is the first movie in the series now dubbed, The Three Favours Cornetto Trilogy*, and for many, this installment is the best. For good reason too, as it's easily the funniest out of the three movies in my opinion. A fun and dare I say, uniquely English take on the zombie horror genre - I mean come on, what other nationality would consider their local pub the safest place to be during an invasion of the walking dead? Well, maybe the Scottish, oh yeah and the Irish. German's? Probably. Heck, even Americans would probably decide a zombie attack was as good a reason as any for a pint.**\n\nAnyway moving on! The first two acts in this movie are superb. Loads of excellent witty dialog, efficiently setting up the hilarious cast of characters and the situation they'll be dealing with for the rest of the movie. I loved the parallels made between our daily 'living' lives and the beginning of the zombie invasion. Don't you honestly feel like that some days? Mindlessly going through the same routine each and every day - work, sleep, repeat, work, sleep, repeat etc. Is it any wonder Shaun (Simon Pegg) makes the same trip to the local store two days in a row and doesn't notice the zombie invasion taking place on the second day!\n\nThe inventive humor and great jokes, come think and fast for most of the movie, and Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are (as usual) hysterical together. The laughs however, do dry up during the last act as we head toward the finish, and the film becomes your basic run of the mill escape the zombies movie. But that's so forgivable considering all great material here, and if you're looking for a fresh funny take on the zombie genre, I highly recommend you watch this film.\n\n* Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End. And yes I used the UK English spelling of FLAVOUR! Quite right!\n\n** I've noticed during my time here in the US, American's really need a reason to justify having a proper drink. St. Patricks Day, News Years Eve, even Cinco De Mayo! It's never because the suns out, or I'm waiting for my laundry, or the day ends in a 'y', or why the hell not?! :-)\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nI'm not a big zombie movie fan, but this film is so worth checking out in my opinion. It should delight fans of the genre as well as people who like a great comedy. This film is rated R due to its bloody content!\n\nBest Format:\n\nNot especially a visual experience, this film can be enjoyed on any device you care to watch it on. It would be best served on a nice big TV with some choice brews from the UK, and good friends! If you can, try to research a local British food store and stock up on your pub snacks to amp up that true public house experience. I'm talking pork scratchings, salted peanuts, maybe Monster Munch but certainly Walkers crisps!***\n\n*** US translation - Crisps = Chips, as in bag of. Chips = steak fries. Spotted dick is a dessert, and not a medical condition. Look it up - it's an actual thing!\n\nBest Moment:\n\nI love it when Shaun and Ed (Nick Frost) are going through the vinyl record collection selecting which albums are okay to throw at two advancing zombies. I personally would have saved the Prince Batman album though!\n\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/shaun-of-the-dead-2004/\n\nhttp://facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://twitter.com/talkiegazette",

It mixes horror with comedy in such a way that it's actually quite witty, though the acting often makes it hard for me to tell if the characters are being hilarious or dramatic. There's definitely a healthy dose of horror here, which makes plenty of sense because this is a zombie movie, but if there's one criticism I have it's that you know that at least somebody's going to die, and that there'll only be about two people left. I wonder why the writers couldn't invest some time in breaking some of the old zombie film clichés when there was plenty of room to do so. With fairness, it's actually quite funny, but the ending was kind of a dud. In my opinion, this movie is alright, but it has some flaws, and suffers from squandered potential.",

            "content": "This movie was everything I expected and more. It's a comedy that grabs onto a genre and pulls out every comedic element they can find. It's like a spoof on zombie films, but without jumping to the point of Airplane-style nonsensical farce. One of the great things the director did was play with all the preconceived notions the audience has about zombie films. So they splice in a lot of jump scares, but I don't think a single one of them is an actual zombie attacking. Instead the zombie's slowly shamble up in the background. Then they use quick whipping camera movements that would normally be for the good guys arming themselves, but instead they use them for things like flushing the toilet and washing hands. I also love how they make it clear early in the film that Shaun is basically already living in a world filled with people who lead zombie-like lives. As a result we are constantly looking for the first sign of a zombie attack, but it's just people walking around in a daze like they always do. They even use some of that late 70s synth music pulled straight from horror movies of that time period, to make it clear what you are in for when you start watching.\n\nWhat's most surprising is that they also manage a fair amount of emotional content in the film despite the craziness of everything happening around the main characters. To have real heartfelt family moments in the midst of a zombie apocalypse is almost too much, but it actually works quite well. I was somewhat surprised that they didn't make a punchline out of these moments, but I think the film is better off keeping it genuine because it lends weight to the underlying character arc of Shaun. I think what makes this movie work so perfectly for me is the brilliant writing. The dialogue between the characters is witty and wonderful. I love how they often talk so nonchalantly about insane things that are happening with the zombies, or the way Shaun talks so excitedly about killing his step-father or his flatmate. I can't help laughing hysterically. But it's not just dialogue, some of the more mundane scenes are constructed so brilliantly for laughs. The single shot of Shaun's first morning after the zombies have struck, as Shaun continues to do his daily routines in a zombie-like daze is amazing. Then there is Shaun and Ed's first encounter with a zombie who they just think is a drunk girl. There are so many moments in this film I could just go on-and-on about, but suffice it to say that Shaun of the Dead is probably my favorite comedy I've watched in a long time and I can't wait to watch the other 2 movies in the Cornetto trilogy because they are based in genre's I like much more than horror. I cannot recommend this film enough.",

The writing, as per Edgar and Simon, is well thought through, witty, and well paced, with a realistic arc and moments that (surprisingly) brought me to tears. The acting is also beyond brilliant, Nick and Simon have some genius moments of comedy, and their friendship is one of the few onscreen relationships that is like a normal friendship, nothing seemed forced or rehearsed.

After a night of heavy drinking Shaun goes to the nearby shop, not noticing the world has been overrun by flesh eating zombies. Back home, he and Ed discover a woman standing in their backyard.

An original satire that introduced the genius team of Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and director Edgar Wright to America. My favorite scene has to be when the zombies were cornering The Winchester bar, I won't spoil it, but it is just plain funny. Shaun of the Dead is a comedy that you need to see more than once to find all of the jokes, because they are so hidden.",

I do, but I'm so overly familiar with it to the point that when I see it nowadays I get very bored by it. I get the same way when I see the movie Young Frankenstein. I was 17 when this movie came out and loved every minute of the movie. Now at 27 I find it overrated, but still somewhat enjoyable as a piece of horror comedy. \n \nShaun is somewhere in his late twenties and is going nowhere in his life. His girlfriend, Liz, dumps him and he spends much of his time with his best bud Ed at the Winchester where they usually get drunk. After a night of drunken fun, Shaun and Ed awake the next day to a zombie apocalypse! They head off to round up a few extra survivors: Liz, her friends David & Dianne along with Shaun's mum, Barbara. Their destination, of all places, is Ed's and Shaun's favorite: The Winchester. \n \nThe first half of this film was always great until the arrive at the Winchester in the later half. That's when it becomes very dull and repetitive. References to much of Romero's 'Dead' movies are throughout the film and that British wit never ceases to not make me laugh. \n \nPart of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy which is followed by Hot Fuzz and The World's End.",

            "content": "Shaun of the dead is one of the funniest comedies ever made, this film is witty, entertaining and very very rewatchable. I've seen this film about 4 or 5 times and every time I see it it gets better. This film is the perfect blend of horror and comedy. The acting is all great, this has some really good British actors. Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton. There is a lot about this film that works. For one this film is really really funny, it's literally non stop laughs from beginning to end. Edgar Wright brilliantly directs this film, he's one of the best comedy directors and directs all of the Cornetto trilogy brilliantly. This film is very fast paced, it's only an hour and a half but it's goes by like nothing which isn't a bad thing as I really don't like boring comedies. The gore and action is also really good, it's surprisingly brutal for such a funny movie especially the scene where one of the characters is pulled out of a window and ripped open. I really like the start where they fight the two zombies in the back yard, using kitchen utensils, records and stuff in the shed. Shaun is one of the most relatable characters of all time. At the start of the film u feel really bad for him as he just constantly messes up his life however by the end of the film he's an unexpected hero. Nick Frosts Ed is really funny he's a character if handled wrong could've been incredibly annoying however he's really funny and probably the best character. There are some really idiotic but funny moments like the bit where Shaun goes to the shop down the road and is unaware of all the zombies around him. Shaun's plan to go to the pub and wait out the apocalypse is incredibly stupid and gets about most of the group killed. There's also some suprisingly emotional scenes. The one with Bill Nighy and Shaun in the car is very sad but the final scene with Shaun and his mum is genuinely heart breaking I nearly cried it was that sad. This is a great film and while I don't like it as much as Hot Fuzz it's still great. It's one of my favourite comedies and zombie movies. A",

            "content": "IN PROGRESS\r\n\r\nHilarious bit of British comedy directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg, and starring Pegg and Nick Frost. Pegg plays Shaun, a man attempting to get some kind of focus in his life as he deals with his friends, family and ex-girlfriend while trying to cope with an apocalyptic uprising of zombies.\r\n\r\nThe film pays homage to many great horror films with more than passing references to Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. What was impressive was how this film stuck to the traditional zombie film formula of blood and gore, without ever trying to tone it down to fit into comedy genre. It is exactly what you expect from a zombie film and even though this is a mostly a black comedy, it stays true to the zombie genre.\r\n\r\nYou might think that this movie is just mainly a spoof of \"Dawn of the Dead\" (1978) but its really more than that. The movie creates a good story on its own so that it becomes more than just a simple spoof. All of the characters are well written and are funny in their own way. The acting is good for comedy standards and the actors perfectly know how to play in both hilarious/funny scene's as well as in serious/emotional one's. \r\n\r\nPegg is excellent as Shaun yet he still kept most of the best lines for Nick Frost (Ed). The two main actors work well together Simon Pegg & Nick Frost are an extremely funny comedy duo. The other cast members all do great jobs too, Kate Ashfield (Liz) plays a straight role to a likable enough degree, Dylan Moran (David) is excellent with his sh*t eating grin as Liz dumps Shaun. Lucy Davies (Di) also does a great job with you feeling such sympathy for her just for the look on the girls face. Last but not least Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are as excellent as ever, as i think we all expect from them, as Shaun's Mom and step father.\r\n\r\nThe script is very well crafted and the film is clever, witty, and over the top funny. Watching this film is a blast and will guarantee a great time. Shaun and Ed are the main characters, and they try to survive in a local pub during an apocalyptic zombie outbreak.  \r\n\r\nIt is a real treat to watch with family and friends, and is a good film to watch during the Halloween season. Many laughs and scares will abound in this latest zombie comedy genre, and therefore is another addition to the very short list of the best zombie comedies ever made. The film should appeal to every horror fan, as this has all the elements of a good horror film and elements of a good comedy film.\r\n\r\nWright and Pegg also insert clever nods to the subtexts of zombie films. Shaun looks and walks like a zombie when he's waking up. We see zombie like office workers, retail workers, \r\n\r\nShaun of the Dead has some great comical moments and yet it has been made with lots of professionalism like this was a serious gory horror movie they were making. Because of this, through its seriousness, the movie becomes perhaps even more hilarious and really delivers. Both the fans of the (British) comedy-genre and the fans of mainly 'Zombie' movies and other gory horror-movies, will be entertained by this movie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShaun of the Dead is one of the best comedy of 2004 and a must-see for all rom zom com (romantic comedy with zombies) fans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plot is simple: Shaun is a guy (not much different from me) who works a droning job, spends most of his free time with his roommate Ed, playing video games, and downing beer after beer at the local Pub. In fact, when we first meet him, he's being dumped by his girlfriend Liz, who is tired of the same old routine.\r\n\r\nSpooky/funny tale of Shaun, an electronics store manager, and his family and friends survive during the first days of a zombie apocalypse. \r\n\r\nbrilliant piece of work which I suspect will achieve the accolade of instant cult status\r\nThere are two scenes in the film which seem to summarise this (and also shine a light of Simon Pegg as a very clever and funny writer) and both scenes simply involve Shaun walking to the nearby corner shop. The first time Shaun plods semi-comatose to the store we simply get the feeling that he is a loser. However, by the time the film shows him making the same journey again we realise that there is a lot more going on! The scene is played with such exquisite subtleness that it has to be one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any film! \r\n\r\n there is a stunning array of visual comedy, one liners and (best of all) some digs at other films from the horror genre.  - dawn of the dead, night of living dead, 28 days later, \r\n\r\nthe dead have risen and are walking the earth in search of human flesh to feast upon. Shaun doesn't notice this fact as quick as he should, but Shaun is somewhat of a zombie himself, lost in his own world and distracted by his own thoughts as he strolls right past the rotting cadavers that now fill the streets of Britain.  While in the store buying a beverage, he doesn't notice the bloody handprints on the refrigerator door and he almost slips in a puddle of blood. I was quite amazed at the response this film got from people in the theater: it seemed that every time something funny happened, the response was almost always with riotous laughter.\r\n\r\nNot even news flashes can get through to Shaun, as (in an incredibly hysterical scene) he channel surfs rapidly, every station finishing the sentence of the one before and giving everyone but the oblivious Shaun the grim news of what is happening in the world.",

Edgar Wright's first big break into film is a zombie satire that has remained timeless ten years later with likeable loser characters and fast-paced snappy editing that's become a staple of Wright's directorial style. It's not just funny though. The film can also get creepy in places and even surprisingly emotional. If a film can make you laugh, scare you and make you cry, then it's doing something right. My only real gripe is the ending which I felt was wrapped up a bit too tightly but even then, this is such a good film that even that's not something that really damages the entire story. Shaun of the Dead is a great Britcom and a terrific debut from an underrated director.",

The way in which Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg match up the horror genre with social and political sature by making use of dark humour is both impressive and intelligent. The story follows the titular character, an unlikely hero in his quest to save his friends, his family and the woman he loves from a zombie attack. A witty screenplay, scattered with snappy dialogue, references to popular culture and many memorable moments, this film almost single handedly legitimated and brought some respect back to the horror spoof genre, to the point that it perhaps seems unrighteous to categorise it in such a way.",

            "content": "Do you remember a time before zombie movies? I know I don't, there's always been zombies as a plot point or a central character but I do remember a time that they weren't as popular as they are now. One of those gems that came after the second revival, which arguably really started with Zack Snyder's Dawn of the dead, was Shaun Of The Dead. As far as firsts go, this was also my first Edgar Wright film and aside from the true narrative power of zombies being portrayed for the first time since Night Of The Living Dead, this was my intro into elaborate and smart comedies.\r\n\r\nThe Good: Excellent exposition, Exacerbation, opening credits, growing up as an adult, great horror shots, double meanings, huge array of comedy and a touching film.\r\n\r\nThe Bad: Some bloated shots.\r\n\t\r\nWhat plagues many horror films, and many films period, is the over use or under use of exposition especially in introductions.  Either we painfully know all about a character or we know so very little and are left to decipher it as we go along. In Shaun Of The Dead the film is beyond clever in it's use of both. Introductions are fast paced and woven into the exposition of another character and their intentions and motivations are made clear. The first scene in The Winchester moved along briskly, hilariously and is an example that ought be followed.\r\n\r\nThe film has a few recurring themes but my favorite is Exacerbation. The film in many different ways shows how things continuously become exacerbated, from a small character level as well as the entire zombie apocalypse. The personal level is best at the Liz and Shaun relationship level, where Shaun is a grown man in a dead end job and yet the only good thing he really has going for him he continues to put under enormous amounts of stress that, finally, takes the end of the world to mend. It's important, clever and darkly funny to put such a focal point on exacerbation even so far as defining it in the opening scene.\r\n\r\nWright, is never a director to shy away from direct physical representation in his films, my favorite is in Hot Fuzz(review to follow.) However Wright's outright portrayal of society being at a stage of zombification is biting. What is Shaun defending other than a tame version of the apocalypse already come? Shaun himself is a form of that zombification shown in the opening, go to work, go home, go to the pub, play video games etc. etc. The opening scene really sets the tone of what to look for throughout the film and works really well at making you look inward to what's important in our lives and question our motives.\r\n\r\nGrowing up is a never ending process, we are all kids on some level. It's picking and choosing constantly that defines us at various levels along with our levels of responsibility. Shaun is a kid in adult attire. He takes the very bare amount of responsibilities having not even excelled in management in his own job and continuously putting boyhood antics ahead of his love life. It is extreme the example it takes for him to grow up but it is very well done, everything Shaun does from the outbreak on dictates him as a character, how he handles his routine and so on. It is fitting that his greatest fixation and crutch, The Winchester, is the moment he does disband his childishness and realizes what is important. It's very metaphorical and well done throughout the neighborhood, with symbolism of childhood interwoven, video games, late nights, even a child's slide.\r\n\r\nJust a quick note on this but the horror and build up shots are very, very well done. The scene that comes most to mind is the scene of Shaun having the zombie atop him while his friend photographs the event. It is reminiscent of Night of The Living Dead, where the first zombie in film history is atop one of the protagonists. Wright has done his homework and his shots are perfect.\r\n\r\nThe comedy is really versatile in this film, there is the obvious slap stick that is used sparingly and very wise in that, but the true humor comes from the absurd and the intelligent. The antics that Shaun and crew come across in the wake of the zombie apocalypse are hilarious, whether it be acting to get across a field of zombies or lending helpful tips on how to handle a zombie kill, Wright is a very well crafted comedic film maker and one of the finest. \r\n\r\nThis film is endlessly touching. Every major relationship in life is represented and even some that aren't always represented in film. The most touching was that of Shaun and his step-father who in a tight space of time manages a story arc from beginning to end, that suitably ends in a chuckle rather than a tear. Goodbyes are the most common place in the film and in it we see Shaun say goodbye to friends, parents, habits and even a little bit of himself in all of it. \r\n\r\nThe Bad.\r\n\r\nSome of the shots and scenes are a bit bloated, and over done. Wright generally fixes these wrongs with good pay off but some of the set up could have been tighter in the editing stages. \r\n\r\nAside from that minor complaint I really, really loved Shaun Of The Dead. It's a film that can be enjoyable for die hard horror and gore fans, as well as comedic and drama fans. It's a film with a wide array and it is still Wright's best film as of yet. 8/10",

The entire mockery of the zombie genre is so hyserical and clever it is hard not to marvel. The editing has a very comic feel to it as well, being extremely enrgized and fast-paced. With all that praise though, I do have one problem with the movie, which is near the end where Shaun has to shoot his own zombified mother. Now I do not mind when drama and comedy blens well like in 50/50, but in that particular scene the drama suddenly seems extremely heavyhanded and a bit too emotional for a comedy, as if the whole film seems to forget what genre it is. But there are a few clever scenes after that saves the movie from completely forgetting its own genre.",

            "content": "The first film in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, this being the red strawberry flavour Cornetto to represent the blood and gore of the horror genre. Yep the ragtag bunch of scruffy oddball Brits from the TV show 'Spaced' are here with more outlandish comedy the likes of which the Americans can only dream of.\n\n Put simply, a regular working stiff must contend with his everyday mundane life that includes various family problems and girlfriend issues. Oh and at the same time there's that zombie apocalypse thing to deal with also, geez some days you just can't catch a break huh.\n\nNow I will admit I'm not a zombie fan, I'm more of a vampire and werewolf person, my reasons? simply because all zombie flicks are almost identical. This comedy/parody/homage is again no difference from the myriad of other zombie flicks out there accept its funny. There is no real explanation for the zombie outbreak, it just happens, but that's not important, this is simply an amusing sketch that has been stretched out into a film.\n\nThat's not to say it doesn't work as it does, but its not as good as many rave on about in my personal opinion. I didn't really get on with the film when I saw it the first time round and this time I can still see why. The start of the film is great fun, I really enjoyed watching'Shaun' flounder in his dead end job with his young teenage staff that don't give a shit...a typical British trait that I've seen in reality. I liked to watch him and his best mate 'Ed' in their trashy rented accommodation that is easily a 'Men Behaving Badly/Bottom' type scenario that we Brits do so well. \n\nThe set up for the film is perfect, a slobby male couple who seem to crawl through life having work/girlfriend issues but plenty of time for drinking and Playstation. Nick Frost is the perfect pub dwelling, overweight, student-like representation and Pegg is the perfect down trodden bloke dreaming of better things. As the zombie outbreak starts to flare up I loved how these two guys don't really notice and when they do it still takes time for it to sink in (as it would). Small sequences where they attack zombies, try to work out what's going on by sitting on the couch, having a drink and watching TV and then trying to get to Shaun's mums house are the best moments early on in the film.\n\nI guess what I don't like about the film is the fact it turns into a semi serious weepy/drama...almost. As the film progresses and the small band of survivors haul up in a pub (how typically British), the film does tend to get quite emotional in parts, little moments that do actually put a lump in your throat (when Shaun's mum dies). Its these points that make me wonder what the film actually wants to be. Essentially the film splits and takes on a whole new approach, first half is a funny sight gag parody, second half becomes a more serious action thriller with emotional deaths, I'm just not sure that I liked that decision.\n\nIts certainly an amusing jaunt that adheres to the old school original zombie school of thought...or laws. In that I mean the zombies are slow moving, lurching creatures that groan a lot and stagger around arms outstretched in a cliched manner. They don't run or think or assist each other, they just stumble around and eat whatever happens to fall in their path, oh and there are are plenty of little tributes to various other zombie classics of course. Think of it along the lines of 'An American Werewolf in London' but not as dark or adult, but as I've said in my other reviews this could so easily be the next Monty Python flick.\n\nPlenty of offensive British language which we all love so much, toilet humour, gore and pop culture references galore. The cast are excellent, the whole film looks good in that quirky little England type of way (good old North London eh) and the dialog is sharp...but I still think 'Hot Fuzz' is the superior of the trilogy.",

Romero (Dawn of the Dead 1978 Version) and Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead) Gives us the much needed beloved take on horror comedy we were so desperately needing. The acting always stays strong and never ceases to lose it's funny and dark sense of humor. This film will always have a special place in my heart as the finest zombie film I have seen to this day.

We actually had no idea it would turn out this good.\n\nThis movie started out slow and if you're thinking during the first fifteen minutes whether or not you should turn it off, trust me, it gets better. We were literally shouting at the screen and couldn't get away from the screen - the movie was a thriller masterpiece. And it was not like usual zombie movies or Walking Dead when people with no fear kill zombies straight away - these were normal people with no plan, a lot of fear and a wish to survive. So the two friends - Shaun and Ed decide to round everybody up and hide in their favorite bar until everything cools off. Good plan, right? Well the plan always sounds good in theory, but in practice there's usually a lot of mishaps.\n\nIt is actually interesting how from the beginning Shaun shows similarities with zombies - how he gets up from bed, his all morning routine is worked out and he does not have to think at all - just follow the schedule. Life seems simple. Actually, when the zombie fever hits, he only notices that when one of them wanders into their yard and even then they think that the girl is just totally wasted and not dead. The realization only comes after they think they killed the girl by accident and then she rises up to attack them. This is quite scary as it shows how people themselves have become zombies or unaware of their surroundings and their activities that they can't recognize what is going on right in front of their eyes. Mike Rugnetta from PBS idea channel was saying (check out his video here - he has great ideas on the zombie topic) that the craze for zombies started out as a fear that technologies will take us over and in zombie apocalypse the only thing you can trust is yourself and your skills. And that is true as none of the technological wonders like cellphones or computers are really helping out when you need to get away from the zombie horde that is chasing you.\n\nBut why I loved this movie was because it was funny, sad and a thriller at the same time and because of the ending: the zombies become a part of the civilization, being pets, loved ones (!) or even having jobs. As funny as that sounds, it is quite scary. I mean it is imaginable to be replaced by a machine as civilization grows, but can you imagine being replaced by somebody who's...already dead?",

Fans of both genres who haven't given it a shot will no doubt come away entertained. The jokes come along nonstop and the performances are charming (especially Simon Pegg), but what is arguably the most captivating aspect of the film is the ingenious build-up leading to the bloody-good zombie action, as Wright utilizes sights and sounds to cleverly create a growing awareness of the impending conflict. It might be a bit much to call it perfect, but 'Shaun of the Dead' looks and feels so cool that it is one of the most well-crafted films of the past decade.",

A couple of years before that Danny Boyle scared audiences in England with his successful zombie flick 28 Days Later. Shaun of the Dead works as a spoof to all zombie movies so the distributors had perfect timing which is essential for a comedy. The film also had a pretty strong fan base considering Simon Pegg and Nick Frost had worked with director Edgar Wright in the past in the TV series Spaced. The setting for this film was just perfect and Wright and Pegg did a great job with the script. Thanks to Shaun of the Dead we got to see these actors team up together for another great film: Hot Fuzz (a spoof on pretty much all the 90's action movies) and for the upcoming The World's End which is receiving great reviews from critics. Fans of the TV series Spaced might enjoy some inside references in Shaun of the Dead, but regardless of wether or not you've seen it you will still have a great time with this film because the script is witty and clever while the performances are also all pretty strong. The more zombie movies you've seen the more you will enjoy this because it makes fun of several of those generic stereotypes. I wouldn't say this is a horror flick because there isn't really a scary moment, but it is an intelligent comedy that makes fun of those cheesy moments in horror films (jump scenes where one person shows up all of a sudden with creepy music in the background). Shaun of the Dead is worth your time if you are looking for a good and fun time.\r\n\r\nShaun (Simon Pegg) is kind of a slacker who hasn't done much with his life. He is content to spend his days with his roommate Ed (Nick Frost) and his girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) hanging out at the local pub where he is a frequent customer. The problem is that Liz is tired of the relationship since all they do is hang out with Ed at the pub and she barely gets to have time alone with him. Shaun promises to take her out to a nice restaurant and turn his life around, but the next day he gets distracted by a visit from his stepdad (Bill Nighy) who reminds him he has to go visit his mother (Penelope Wilton) thus forgetting to reserve a table for dinner with his girlfriend. Tired of Shaun's broken promises, Liz decides to break up with him. Shaun realizes it's time to turn his life around, but something strange is happening in his town. All of a sudden dead people are coming back to life and attacking everyone so Shaun realizes this is the perfect opportunity to prove to Liz that he is capable of saving and protecting her from the deadly zombie attacks.\r\n\r\nShaun of the Dead works really well thanks to the great chemistry between Simon Pegg and Nick Frost; you can tell their friendship transcends the big screen and seeing them pair up is what works best in this film. The British gags and cultural references cross borders and the jokes are effective anywhere. This is one film anyone can enjoy because it works on its own. It isn't one of those spoof films which you can only enjoy if you've seen the movie it's making fun of. The fun and the jokes work on their own and the relationship between the characters is also really strong. Shaun of the Dead came to my attention when Quentin Tarantino shared his list of the 20 best films of the last 20 years and this movie appeared on that list. I really enjoyed this movie, but I don't consider it among the best comedies of our era. In my opinion Hot Fuzz was even funnier, but I really look forward to The World's End which looks really promising. Shaun of the Dead is worth checking out if you are one of the few people that haven't seen it.",

Shaun also has comedy, gags, correct pace, an everything but dumb dialogue, fresh flavour and it's simply entertaining. This \"other\" look into the zombie genre is such a new concept that it simply drags attention, and satisfies. The comdey isn't extremely hilarious, but just the perfect level of comedy to fuse with gore, something i only saw working on Zombieland, another cool and well made horror-comedy.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that made this movie shine it's the cast: they deliver believable characters, each with their own satire and gravitas, and ultimately help the story, not the concept. The latter happens when in a horror movie, characters are so bland, they're obviously made only to be killed. Shaun of the Dead actually makes each character to develop and be useful to the story, even when some of them die, they help on other character's evolution, creating crisp characters. The gags and jokes are actually very funny, and again, they feel like part of the story, and not a desperate manouver to keep audiences up. Here, zombies come with comedy, or no zombie at all. Awesome formula. And last but not least, the story itself has new ways to start, continue and end a zombie apocalypse with convincing results each. Director Edgar Wright couldn't have directed this movie any better.\r\n\r\nShaun of the Dead it's the first of three Edgar Wright comedies, known as the Three Flavour Cornetto Trilogy (now i want ice cream for some reason...), and i'm sure the others will deliver as well. As far as this trilogy goes in this Holiday Reviews, the first one starts strong, and i'm sure i'll continue and end just as strong. A reliable, funny and fresh british horror comedy.\r\n\r\nQueen!\r\n\r\nHAPPY HOLIDAYS REVIEWS PART 07: Shaun of the Dead (2004)",

This film marked the first collaboration between Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and director Edgar Wright and is a mostly solid affair. The performances and directing are all handled well, but it wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as I was expecting. Maybe it's because British humor isn't something I 100% get. Still, I thought that the gore was well-done, tension was kept up and the characters were all likable enough that I cared what happened to them. For me, the best moments were the quieter situational humor rather than the gory kills that one would expect from such a horror-comedy. Overall, it's one of the better horror-comedies to come out in the last 10 years and should provide enough thrills and laughs for genre fans.",

I watch movies, quote movies, and let them impact my life in many ways but very few have a greater effect than Shaun of the Dead. The title spoofs Dawn of the Dead but this is nothing like it. A zombie movie, yes, but this is an Edgar Wright film with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. This trio has made some great movies but this is the one that put them on the map. An idiot and his friend try to survive the zombie apocalypse by going to their favorite pub. \n\tThe best part of this movie is the little details any fan of the movie can appreciate. From the opening credits to the very end, everything is connected. In the opening credits there is a girl at a cash register and a black guy checking his phone. These people return later in the film as zombies. Maybe you noticed it, maybe you didn't but I noticed everything. Snake hips, John, his wife, the other old lady, and even Nelson. Characters we see for three seconds or have two lines come back in some way. Every line is on purpose and everything is connected. The 17 year old kid is the same kid who is frequently calling Ed. I know everything about anything in the Shaun of the Dead universe. For the record, dogs can look up.\n\tI quote movies all the time. I have never seen a movie that I quote more than Shaun of the Dead. I probably say \"you got red on you\" at least a few times a week. When I was 17 and somebody asked how old I was I would say 17 just like the kid in the movie. In fact, whenever I say 17 I say it like that kid in the store. Every scene has something funny in it through the script. The chemistry between Nick Frost and Simon Pegg drives this movie. They comedically play off each other all the time. \"There's a girl in the garden.\" That entire scene is a riot. The throwing of the albums and kitchen objects was great. The zombie tackles Shaun and Ed goes in the house to get a camera. I laugh every time. Since I have seen this movie I call my mom \"mum\" instead of \"mom\" or\" mama\" that is the effect this movie had on me. \n\tThe cinematography and camera angles are also really good. The beginning where the camera bounces back and forth between Shaun, David, Liz, and the other girl was great. The scene where Shaun and Ed are trying to come up with a plan was even better. It is little things like the teeth being brushed to the toilet flushing to the pinning of the Shaun nametag makes this movie great, that and the constant laughs. \n\tEvery character in this movie was great. I love Ed, sympathize for Shaun, understand Liz, hate David, and am annoyed with Shaun's mum and the other girl I can never remember the name of. The story is at times obvious, like David being in love with Liz and that causing a love triangle between Liz, him, and Shaun. Now throughout the movie I wanted David dead. He was so obnoxious, all he does is complain and be an idiot, but that poor guy did not deserve what he got. Ed is obviously the best character with laughs from beginning to end. He is a guy I would easily get along with and as dumb as he is the friendship he has with Shaun is real. They have a real brotherhood and I love every second of it.\n\tBottom line, this is a zombie movie. A very funny zombie movie but still a zombie movie so that means a few things. The zombies, the gore, and the endgame. The zombies in this movie look fantastic and the gore is great. When the zombie goes through the pole and her guts go everywhere was unexpected and disturbing, but also kind of funny. I really hope somebody laughed other than me. This movie did get serious as well and had some really emotional moments as well. There is one scene that is just so hard to watch and that is the climax with Shaun vs. David. That scene was so well done and watching the chaos was so entertaining. \nShaun of the Dead is a rollercoaster of laughs but I guess I need to address the big question of is it better than Hot Fuzz. No. Plain and simple. The reason, Queen. That scene when Queen comes on the jukebox is one of my favorite scenes in movie history. Shaun Ed and Liz are beating the bartender with pool sticks. The zombies are trying to get in, the fire extinguisher going along with the song, everything in this scene worked. I can just see the writers laughing over it as they write it and Edgar Wright directing it with a huge smile.\nOverall, Shaun of the Dead is a rollercoaster of laughs. There is not a single thing I don't like about this movie. If I had to choose it would be that it is a British comedy and the accents can be too much and some of the language is hard to understand, but who cares. It never slows down, the laughs never stop, and I could watch this every day. I watched this movie countless times with an old friend and I suggest you watch this with as many people as possible. I have never met a person who has not liked this movie so it has to get the WillyT Seal of Approval. When Simon Pegg, Nock Frost, and Edgar Wright are together expect a seal of approval.",

After I saw it, however, I started to wonder why this was the movie getting all of the praise. I mean it's not a bad film at all... In fact, it's a very well made movie, but I guess something didn't click with me that may have clicked with others. One of the main things I heard about this movie was how funny it was. While watching the movie, I only laughed a couple times, and that was before the zombie apocalypse ensued. I feel like they didn't know what kind of movie they wanted to make: An actual zombie movie, or a funny satire? At times, it can feel like either one of those. Another thing that never really clicked with me was that it feels like not a lot happened in the movie. I mean, obviously a zombie apocalypse happened, which is basically all you need, but the main event of the movie was our group of characters trying to make it to a pub. That's it. They could have come up with something a little better than that. Other than those two huge problems, the rest of the movie is good. The characters are unique and memorable, and the zombie effects are fantastic. You can obviously tell they drew inspiration from George Romero's films for the effects, and many other factors of this film. Overall, I would recommend this movie to zombie fans. Maybe it will click with you more than it did for me. -Brett",

            "content": "Ten years ago this month (July 2013), Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright and Nick Frost were filming what is now regarded as one of the finest comedy films of the last decade. Two parts of the trio (Pegg and Wright), who met on the set of Pegg's cult sitcom, Spaced, wrote the film, as an ode to George A. Romero's classics Night of The Living Dead, Dawn of The Dead (Most notably) and Day of The Dead. Shaun of The Dead proved to be a smash, cementing it's place as a modern comedy classic, while launching the mainstream careers of the three men behind it. Nine years after release, and with my viewing of The World's End (The finale in the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy) just around the corner, does Shaun... hold up?\r\n\r\nYes, undoubtedly. Shaun... remains one of the funniest films released in recent years, a perfect blend of horror, human drama, and of course, side-splitting comedy. Following lovable loser Shaun (Pegg), at the tail end of his twenties, and still working in an electronics store, surrounded by students holding down part-time jobs (Including the hilarious Rafe Spall), much to the chagrin of his girlfriend of three years, Liz (Kate Ashfield). As if wasn't enough to worry about, Shaun is catching heat from his flatmate Pete (Peter Serafinowicz, in a brilliantly-cast role), due to Shaun's best friend, slacker Ed (The incomparable Nick Frost) taking up residence on their couch, without bringing any money into the house, save for his small-time marijuana business. It doesn't end there, however, as Shaun has a rocky (To put it lightly) relationship with stepfather Phillip (The inexplicably-cast Bill Nighy) who, as Shaun puts it \"chased me round the garden with a bit of wood!\". Phillip has been an antagonist to Shaun since he as twelve, marrying Shaun's mother Barbara following the (Implied) death of his father.\r\n\r\nHowever, Liz is growing tired of the relationship's lack of direction, and professes her wanting more from life, not going to The Winchester every night, drinking herself to death, wondering where it all went wrong. With backing from her own flatmates, Dianne and David (Played by Lucy Davis and one of the greatest Irish Stand-Ups of all time, Dylan Moran), Liz dumps Shaun, sending his life into a spin. After a rocky night out, and a tongue-lashing by Pete, Shaun makes a vow to get his life together, and get Liz back. Then the zombies turn up. Shaun and Ed are bombarded at home by zombies and, after finding out how to deal with them, set out to save Liz and Barbara (And their hangers-on).\r\n\r\nWhere to start when praising Shaun of The Dead? It is a near-flawless marriage of horror and comedy, ramping up the chills (Noticing the door creak open, as Shaun and Ed slowly realise that they left it ajar, is suitably tense), and pay them off in the most gleefully silly ways. Right away, perhaps the strongest feature of the film is it's writing. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright craft both a loving ode to the horror films they grew up with, while making a highly original, wholly British comedy film. The references do not over-saturate the film (Or overtake it, as in last year's Ted), instead punctuating the brilliant dialogue-based humour, itself perfectly realised by the incredible cast. The witty banter between characters, the  in-jokes (The Spaced reference/cast mirror bit is absolute gold), and the oh-so-British sense of humour make Shaun of The Dead a treat, from a writing standpoint.\r\n\r\nAside from the great script, we get a great director in co-writer Edgar Wright. I guess directing your own material, with you co-writer also being your star, and good friend certainly has it's benefits. Wright seems in love with the characters, the material, even bleak old Britain, zombies an' all. His sure-handedness belies the playfulness of the camerawork, replaying a scene from earlier in the film, now with more zombies, proves all too easy for Wright, and he pulls off much of the flourishes with ease. Using sound effects (Both produced by computers, and by the actors) to set the scenes, Wright seems at home in this bizarre take on the apocalypse. Moments like the now-legendary zombie attack, to the Queen classic 'Don't Stop Me Now' let Wright loose, displaying his instinct for controlled chaos (He often choreographs the action to the song), while simulataneously furthering the story in an accessible manner. And that might be the biggest directorial achievement in Shaun... Wright manages to mix moments of Comedy, Terror, and Drama with little effort. He so effectively melds the three onscreen, that many directors these days (Be they of any genre) could take a tip.\r\n\r\nThen there's the acting. The characters, at first glance, may be seen as caricatures, aping the classic Zombie-Movie formula. You have the rather blank audience surrogate hero (Shaun), the funny, lovable sidekick (Ed), the love interest (Liz), the elderly family member (Barbara), and the hangers-on (Dianne and David). As the film progresses, however, we can see that these are very well-rounded characters, each with their own tics, nuances, and problems. Only one character in the film (By my estimation) doesn't get at least one defining moment. The centre, of course, is Pegg's Shaun. Shaun is a flawed hero, just trying to prove that he can get his life together, and the Apocalypse proves quite the opportunity for him to do so. The supporting cast are all stellar, with special mention given to Nick Frost. His portrayal of the slovenly, self-centered, but surprisingly charming, and unabashedly lovable Ed is one of the film's best. Undoubtedly, the performances in Shaun... add to the vital human element, that puts it above so many sub-par comedies.\r\n\r\nMy favourite aspect of Shaun of The Dead, however, is the fact that it is less a zombie-centred film than it is a biting (Geddit?) social satire, with the undead thrown in for good measure. Shaun's plight perfectly mirrors that of a generation of British youth, whose lives drift, and none find the motivation to get their careers, or social lives on track. The Zombie Apocalypse, to me, represents Shaun and co's being forced to find some meaning in their lives, to let go of childish instincts, and finally grow up. These were themes explored in Spaced too, about a couple of British youths who have yet to find fulfillment in life. I suppose the nihilistic way of approaching life as it is (Pre-Zombies) validates the odd casting decision of Dylan Moran.\r\n\r\nIf I were to pick anything I dislike about Shaun of The Dead, I would probably echo Richard Roeper's own RT quote. He essentially says that the film devolves into a horror-style showdown by the film's end, and while I don't fully agree with how he puts it, I can certainly see where it comes from. The drama is given much more precedence than the humour, which can be seen as a bad thing, given the film's supposed genre. As I think about it, I actually might disagree, however, as the end may be seen as a loving ode to how most classic zombie films finish, with the characters going into meltdown, before the inevitable rescue by plot device. This can be equated to the ending of Hot Fuzz which, while more obvious a parody of the Michael Bay action and James Bond start-and-stops, may be construed as forgetting parody/homage, and becoming your alleged target. Nevertheless, I do feel that the drama was slightly over-the-top at the end of the film, and detracted ever-so-slightly from my overall enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day however, Shaun of The Dead remains a modern comedy classic, having helped launch the careers of the three men behind it, and started the Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy, which looks to be one of the most consistent trilogies in Tomatometer history at the moment. From it's brilliant acting, to it's razor-sharp script, to it's genre-bending direction, Shaun of The Dead is a comedy that succeeded on all fronts, and gave us a number of comedic institutions in the process.\r\n\r\nFinal Grade: A-",

The cast is quite stellar; Simon Pegg's turn as Shaun was incredibly strong for this type of movie - dramatic, emotional, and hilarious to boot. The rest of the survival team also gets plenty of time to shine, and it was pretty funny seeing Lucy Davis in a role outside The Office (noticed Martin Freeman in there, too!). Shaun of the Dead's success really comes from its script, though, which deftly balanced the terror of a zombie apocalypse and losing loved ones and running for your life while also providing plenty of humor to lighten up the dark mood. It takes a couple predictable turns along the way, but in the end, it gets the job done splendidly. I usually hate anything even a wee bit scary or gory, but Shaun of the Dead won me over with its charm, wit, and - something I wasn't expecting - heart.",

The chemistry between Ed (Nick Frost) and Shaun (Simon Pegg) is fantastic.  The laughs are hit and miss though. My favorite scene was the one were they throw vinyl records at the zombies which was hilarious. The big problem I have with this movie is that it never knows if it wants to be funny, or if it wants to be sad. When a character in this film dies it clearly isn't funny, but your not really that sad since you just laughed really hard at a joke they said 2 minutes ago.  Some memorable quotes and a decent cast make this movie a fun watch.",

Whether some of the jokes have now become a bit dated, or whether it just wasn't that great I'm not sure, but it just didn't have me gripped for long periods. As it told the story of zombies taking over the streets of London, we focus on two best mates, so used to living their repetitive couch potato lifestyle, who set about rescuing there family and friends from the apocalypse before it comes too late. it had some good one liners, but I was only having the odd wry smile as opposed to fits of hysterics, which was a shame given that the film had clearly dedicated itself over to being a spoof comedy as opposed to an actual zombie horror. There were a lot of familiar faces in this including Bill Nighy, and a cameo appearance from a young Matt Lucas - just a shame they didn't include him more from a comedy perspective! Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad film, just that I was expecting a little more from it. It was entertaining throughout with the typically British dry style of humour used, and the story flowed nicely, culminating in a fiery conclusion down the local pub. It's one of those comedy partnerships which I can give or take really - not desperately eager to see more from them on the basis of this, but I wouldn't shy away from other instalments if presented with the opportunity (if the price is right of course)!",

Especially jarring is the comedic handling of zombies in the majority of the film-- handily defeated by virtually-bloodless-smacks with cricket bats, flying records, and fooled by fake shambling and moans-- giving way to the horrifyingly gory (and entirely unsympathetic) end for Dylan Moran's David, and a sudden need to turn hordes of assailants into genuine threats rather than jokes. \n\n\"Shaun of the Dead\" is a deftly executed bit of parody that still works of its own accord; an evolution of ideas explored in \"Spaced,\" and a promising start for one of cinemas' great visual storytellers.",

            "content": "Nowadays zombies are common occurrence, but director Edgar Wright and writer/star Simon Pegg have seemingly tried to squish zombies, horror and violence and deadpan humour into one film, with almost disastrous results. \n\n        Simon Pegg portrays Shaun a man whose life is going nowhere.  He spends his life at the local pub, The Winchester, with his lazy best friend Ed.  When his girlfriend Liz dumps him, he must win her back, get his life back together and survive from the uprising zombies who want to eat everyoneâ(TM)s guts out. \n\n        Pegg and Wright have their hands on a good premise here that must be used to good effect; which, to start with, they do.  Because with some smart humour and some interesting camerawork, this film gets off to a good start.  When the zombies first arrive, you start to laugh at Frost and Pegg as they amusingly fight off two zombies and battle their way through a small army of them in an attempt to save Shaunâ(TM)s mum and Liz and her friends.\n\n        They find their way to The Winchester, apparently a safe haven, and this is where the film takes a sharp turn towards the bloody and gory zombie abyss.  The laughs magically disappear, as will the squeamish viewers, as the violence goes from comic and bloody to gut-wrenching and a bit cringe-worthy.\n\n        Many of the main characters are killed or transformed into zombies and this makes the film seem like a corny comedy horror film begging for laughs, which towards the end, it was.  The deadpan humour slowly dries up as the film goes on. \n\n       This film does however prove that Simon Pegg is a magnificently talented actor.  His performance is littered with tears, anger and passion.  Frost and Lucy Davis (of The Office fame) also perform amusingly and other good performers include Kate Ashfield and Dylan Moran.  There are also cameos for Matt Lucas, Tamsin Greig and Martin Freeman, who reunites with Lucy Davis.\n\n        This film claims to be a âromantic comedy with zombies.â?  However this film is actually half a romantic comedy with zombies and half of it is a violent zombie horror with romance and comedy occasionally dropped into the mixture.  A film of two halves, Shaun of the Dead will, for me, be remembered for its awful rendition of horror in its second half.",

The acting was absolutely great, and I thought that the characters reacted to the living dead the same as I would. It was also very realistic in the sense that they didn't just find guns laying on the ground for no reason, they had to find miscellaneous melee weapons to fight the zombies. The comedy was great, and I loved how they cracked jokes in the middle of all the terror. The character's are extremely well fit for each other, and certain ones basically recreate the whole conflict, and help develop the story. This movie is just short of a classic.",
