Sure there were some good ones like Elvis and Rocketman, but we haven't gotten anything that brought the magic like Walk The Line or Love & Mercy. So to watch this film that came out almost 20 years ago, all I can say is wow. Jamie is of course the star of this film as he gives a terrifyingly accurate portrayal of the jazz legend not from just his voice but his movements in terms of how he walked and the twitching for when he was going through withdrawal. I also like how the film didn't hold back on the punches in showing in detail how drugs and the music industry affect an artists health. A must watch for anyone with any interest in the genre of jazz.",

He does find music, specifically a piano, as a way to cope with his blindness and eventually as a career, moving to the city on a bus cross country, making his way as he is exploited by both blacks and whites. He eventually makes the then-controversial move of mixing gospel with contemporary music.\n\nHow accurate it is, I cannot say, but it is straightforward and not only Jamie Foxx but all the supporting cast are convincing.

            "content": "\"Ray\" is an incredible movie, and it mostly is because it can keep the viewer in tension and mixed feelings throughout the entire 2 and a half hour run, which is usually considered long. But, Jamie Foxx's performance makes all that time feel like 30 minutes, as of how realistic it is. He portrayed James Charles's voice amazingly, as well as he portrayed his moves pretty well. The entire movie's plot is really good, as it is about a singer, a DEAF singer, struggling to overcome his heroine addiction. As of right now there are plenty movies that exist with a similar plot of a musician trying to get off an addiction, like \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"Rocketman\", but this one was the founding one for all of them basically, as it was the most realistic. You believe in Ray Charles's feelings, you understand everything he is doing and why he is doing this. All the characters around him also are very realistic, which is a huge plus to this movie. The biography of the musician is opened brilliantly, as it is historically very accurate, and, although you know what everything will end like in the beginning, it is interesting to look at what happened and what Ray Charles did, for example, that benefited the black community. Jamie Foxx does not look like himself in this movie which is why I think that he is the gem of this film and I think that his Oscar was deserved. The soundtrack is obviously amazing, as it is the pure music of that time. The decorations and the themes of scenes are awesome, as you can feel the atmosphere of the time they are in. The only reason I don't give this movie a 10 is because of it's cuts. Some of it are very quick and unpleasant to an eye to view, some of which even included a fade to a white color, which doesn't look good, as well as there are a lot of quick dissolve cuts. But overall, this is a great movie to watch, whether you are a fan of Ray Charles or not, he was a genius and was an outstanding performer. Not many remember that movie, I don't really get why, but I think it's brilliant and everybody should check it out if they didn't, a powerful 9/10.",

            "content": "The musical biopic genre rarely inspires any trust in me as Walk the Line (2005), Lady Sings the Blues (1972) and Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) were particularly disappointing. This is one of the films that kicked off the 2000s trend of these sorts of films being produced as a safe play for Academy Awards. I have to say that all my suspicions were confirmed in watching the film as it felt simultaneously over long and rushed, featuring underwritten characters and a screenplay that runs through events without making any deeper observations on how they effected the subject of the film. I needed the film to display more than just the conventions of the genre as while Jamie Foxx gets the chance to chew the scenery everybody around him falls away and we are left with little to ruminate on.\n\nBlind musician Ray Robinson, Jamie Foxx, finds success as a pianist despite his disability and is soon represented by Turkish producer Ahmet Ertegun, Curtis Armstrong, who helps him write and record several hit songs. He is traumatized by the death of his brother and his difficult relationship with his distant mother Aretha, Sharon Robinson, who refuses to help him for fear of him not becoming self sufficient. He finds consolation in heroin which contributes to the deterioration of his relationship with supportive wife Bea Washington, Kerry Washington, who tolerates his affairs with Margie Hendricks, Regina King, and Mary Ann Fisher, Aunjanue Ellis. He becomes involved in the Civil Rights movement as his fame grows and he discovers his own sound after imitating the work of others. Temptation comes in the form of alternative management which provides him with more money but less personal connection and allows him the ability to indulge his addictions. Eventually he reaches rock bottom and requires rehabilitation to return to performing.\n\nMost of the praise directed toward the film at the time came from the breakout performance of star Foxx who did a reliable impression of the real life Charles which probably involved hours of watching video of him and a lot of practicing the piano. While he gets all of the tics and mannerisms right I never felt as though I knew about Charles as a man or understood his emotional motivation for a lot of the actions he takes. Foxx is hampered by a weak screenplay that both spells out a lot of ideas too explicitly while glossing over other, more interesting ones. Despite this issue you would expect that he could attempt to move beyond simple imitation and plumb the inner depths of Charles' troubled relationship with his mother and wife.\n\nEvery female character in the film feels one dimensional as Washington is the typical supportive wife, the mistresses are \u2018bad' women and his mother is abusive but redeemed by a few moments of encouragement. We touch on aspects of their characters that could have been fascinating as the strange acceptance of her husband's affairs that Washington displays was something that could have revealed something deeper about her. Was she actually a damaged, troubled woman behind her shiny, polished fa\u00e7ade? We never get to see any of her real frustration or desperation as the big, over the top scenes in which she gives monologues that tear him down are so generic and overwritten that we can't take them seriously. His mistresses are also typically presented as trashy, overly emotional woman who aren't nearly as good as the saintly, perfect wife who stands by him despite his significant faults. Were these mistresses to feel like real women who exist not as an example of the immorality that he will inevitably overcome through a Christian redemption but as struggling woman who see something in Charles that answers their pain. The James L. White screenplay never digs deeper than this and we are left with terribly written scenes in which highly capable of actresses such as Washington and King are reduced to shouting out their emotions in predictable fashion.\n\nFinally, the film feels like a series of events occasionally interrupted by a disaster or tragedy of sorts. Yes, we need to understand that Charles was highly successful but it often feels as though we waste time hearing about how well one of his records sold or whether he will be incorporating gospel into his music. At the end of the film we feel as though director Taylor Hackford has introduced entirely new conflicts such as the troubling influence of his meddlesome agent that are never cleared up. We end on the usual epilogue provided by a biopic that tells us that the subject of the film was a good person who overcame their struggles in life but we can't help feeling as though we have heard the least interesting version of this story.",

James L. White's screenplay is smart yet somehow fails to keep the audience engaged into it despite of having some high pitched dramatic sequences. Taylor Hackford has done an amazing work on executing the script and the characters onto the screen and create something colossal out of it with the help of amazing cinematography and fine editing. The performance is where the feature steals the show and the heart of it lies with Jamie Foxx who is supported by a great cast like Karee Washington and Regina King. Ray is a character driven feature that shouts out the affection that makers had for Ray which is what helps it work like a charm.",

All of the achievements Charles achieved and all of the tribulations he faced in the two decade time span the film covers is simply too packed for a film told using this kind of narrative structure. The structure itself is rather messy: starting in the late 1940s with the introduction to Charles' singing career, the film breezes through major points in Charles' life without the kind of development or focus you expect from biopics of this kind. The sporadic flashbacks to Charles' childhood on a plantation don't help with the film's already rushed nature, although they are some of the more emotional and impactful scenes in the film. Oddly, the film has a lengthy two and a half hour runtime: there's plenty of time for all of these moments to be fleshed out more than they are, and yet the film is still so desperate to get to the next big moment in Charles' life.\n\nTruly the one thing keeping the film afloat is Jamie Foxx's Oscar winning portrayal of Ray Charles. Foxx manages to nail Charles' electric personality that became ever so famous from his performances, including his distinctive vocals. He also, however, captures the more troubled side of Charles, the man dealing with blindness, heroin addiction, and family troubles that haunt his past. The performance is so good, it becomes the saving grace of an otherwise standard biopic.",

When we can recall where it all began to whom got us there then and whom got us there now. When we know all to we'll when someone hustles us, but other times we have to face blindness can't see everything or every time we are hustled. We can't see to Somethings we are not welcomed to by others, and others we are welcomed. When we are assisted along the way, to being haunted by not offering assistance to other things. When we have always lived on the edge, need to escape it all, get our mind away from things, when we are traumatized by our past. When we recall the time when we did go blind. When each song or hit is homage to something in our past that got us there. \"Baby Let me Hold your Hand\". But can't recall to how we went blind, it was all a mystery. When we are good, for a reason, when we have followed the greats. When we choose not to follow others to follow our talents elsewhere. When we are only good, when we are original and have our own sound. And some songs/hit are from someone else's mind. When we just don't know how he does it. When he is different than most men, not based on how he sees in being blind, but by how he sees in how he sees life in his music and real life. When he hears how he sees, god given gifts. When some gifts are hidden and great. When some gifts he can see without eyes. When some gifts that came straight from God we make our own from songs to a great wife. When the Devils gifts are also great, that makes changing god music for sex for money even more better. When others are no fool, and are not blind. When we can see how good we are and wanted that our senses besides our eyes are enheightened to want things. When we are coming around with our own sound, by our god given skills and devil's hand. When we are becoming a greater hit, and make fools out of everyone whom we betray, abandon, leave behind.  When we lost our eye on whom got us  here, whom nourished us, made us grow and whom got us there along the way. When we havent lost our way on some aspects, the wrong ways we kept and right ways we left behind. When we are less gospel, and more devilish that we enjoy that got us here. When we have a larger fellowship, larger sound, larger profits, larger label, that we care what people say, so much different from life growing up. When we are handed to the world so early and unable to see, cared for to get an education for blind people, that have to take care for ourselves. When being fooled when we least expect it, in time where things are getting bad, we take a stand. When it's a time where being different isn't accepted. When we are accepted for some things we do, but other things which is unlawful. When it's both that is not accepted, when its conflicting with people's values, views, households, life, money, politics and religion. When all what we do is due to being alone in the dark, all our life and in the industry of sound we lead.",

All the other characters are very good too, though they sometimes fade into the background when compared to Jamie Foxx's character.

            "content": "By this point it's pretty hard to do something original with a biopic, and now that I've seen several of them (particularly the musical kind) a pattern has emerged. Typically, they will pick a time period in a person's life/career and focus on a certain personal struggle and how they overcome it. With musicians, this often involves women and substance abuse. 'Tis the same story with Ray Charles. RAY focuses on Ray Charles' beginnings in the music business up through the point at which he came clean off of heroin (around 1966). To round out the narrative, there are flashbacks to his childhood and an extended coda which ties up a significant plot point from before and serves as an epitaph to his life and career (the film came out several months after his death). Because so many biopics follow the same formula, what distinguishes them from one another (other than the subject) is the quality of the performances and the ingenuity with which they are put together, and RAY certainly stands out from the rest thanks in large part to an excellent central performance by Jamie Foxx. The way he inhabits Ray Charles is uncanny at times, although the straightforward dramatic scenes verge on mimicry in a way that stands out more when juxtaposed with the performance scenes. For me, the performance scenes work better because Jamie Foxx was able to capture a realness and immediacy that comes from someone who is intimately familiar with performing music on the stage (as Foxx is also a singer). Beyond that I thought that the editing, particularly in the musical sequences had a certain kinetic energy that brought the performances to life. However, I found it a little distracting that Ray Charles' voice was coming out of Jamie Foxx's body when there was a few early scenes where Jamie Foxx used his own voice to sing. Even still, I got used to it after a while. In general, I thought that everyone gave a good performance, and the film had an excellent ensemble cast. One thing I also thought was done rather well was the hallucinogenic nature of the flashback scenes, which added a layer of artfulness as inner turmoil, with Ray Charles feeling guilty about how his younger brother died. What I felt didn't always work was the general formula and obligatory dramatic moments which hit again and again just how dependent Ray became on heroin. I got a little tired and frustrated with it in WALK THE LINE (although that came out the following year, and followed RAY's playbook) and felt the same way here. Yes, it was a compelling arc to have in a general sense, but it's something that's been played out a little bit too much, in my opinion. Despite the formulaic nature of the plot and story, I had a great time with RAY because of the talented actors who brought it to life, and the energetic and soulful musical numbers. RAY might rely a little too heavily on formula, but at least it's a winning one.",

            "content": "Ray is undeniably a good film. Some areas are great and most areas are good. Although some not so much, it's definitely a worthy film to witness.\n\nTo explain the areas where Ray isn't so strong, much of the story of Ray doesn't explore any kind of territory that would separate it from most biographical films about musicians. I mean, Ray Charles experiences the same drug addiction, musical criticism and acts of adultery that many musical figures have already gone through such as Jim Morrison and Johnny Cash. We've already witnessed films about these figures and their issues in the same essential vein, and Ray introduces nothing new to the same basic formula except for the fact that it's main figure is blind and portrayed by Jamie Foxx. It's difficult to criticise a film which follows someone's life yet remains formulaic, because then it's like I'd be criticising Ray Charles for living a formulaic life. But I guess the main problem is that it isn't dramatised as best as it could be much of the time and doesn't take on any sort of eccentric film style which would have made it more memorable. It's script is similarly formulaic as well, and although it isn't damaging at all, like the film style it just isn't anything special.\nSince Ray doesn't have too much in its story that's contrasts it from the standard musician biopic formula, it also feels rather long and stretched out over a period of 152 minutes, so it doesn't always have sufficient constancy in maintaining viewer interest.\nBut what saves Ray is that it has the greatest lead anybody could ask for to play the role of musical legend Ray Charles.\nJamie Foxx has all the kindred spirit of Ray Charles without ever opening his eyes, but even a man as blind as Ray Charles himself could tell that Jamie Foxx is absolutely perfect for the role. Jamie Foxx plays the piano as flawlessly as he sings, and even though he cannot see what he is doing in the film, any blind man could know that he is nothing short of the ideal Ray Charles embodiment. With his glasses comes a certain smile which has all the groove and strength behind it that Ray Charles can be iconic for, and to know that behind those glasses lies Jamie Foxx is to know the true extent of a man's talent as an actor. Had Ray Charles been alive to hear but not see Ray, it's unarguable that he would be impressed by Jamie Foxx, the same way the Academy Awards were.\nCurtis Armstrong is at some of his best work ever in Ray. With so many notable actors and characters, he was one that seriously stuck out for me because his portrayal of Ahmet Ertegun was an excellent visual embodiment of the character as well as a meaningful performance of him, even in the short amount of screen time he received. He had such passionate spirit in him, and it made Ray more of a great film which also gave nostalgic memory to his days in Revenge of the Nerds by reminding us that he was once a successful actor from an 80's comedy and still has such electric talent, even in a small role in Ray. \nKerry Washington, Sharon Warren and Regina King also all supply fine supporting performances to Ray.\nEven Warwick Davis' small role capitalised on his charm and talent as an actor very well.\n\nSo Ray is a bit long and rather formulaic, but Jamie Foxx is too perfect for the lead role and it puts a good name to everything.",

            "content": "Ray Charles is one of the greatest musicians that ever lived. He brought jazz music to a new frontier, helped boost the civil rights movement, and became a legend through his music. He did all this, while also being blind. He never used a cane or a dog because he knew he could take care of himself and he was ready for anything the world threw at him. This was an inspirational man for African Americans, blind people, and most of all musicians. He was also a crazy drug addict that usually loved his heroine more than his family. Oh and also, \u00a0he was having pretty messed up affair with two different women while he was married to his wife. All this drama and his legacy must make an amazing movie, right? Well, yes and no.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0I always start with acting in my reviews, and then I move onto directing and writing and then the cinematography, music, and editing. That's how my reviews are usually structured, but I'm not doing that in this review. I'm changing it up a bit and I'm going to start with directing and writing (those things are the big problems with this movie for me) then I'll do acting and then cinematography, music, ect. So, let's start with directing. I really think the directing in this film was truthfully really bad. I don't know what it was but it was like i was watching a giant 2 hour montage about Ray Charles life. The structuring and pacing was terrible. The film moved way to fast and so many scenes (they weren't really scenes, more like moments) in the movie were like 10 seconds long and not that investing. The film was just way to rushed and I hardly got emotionally attached to Ray's character. So many things were happening way to fast and I was just getting sick of it. By the end of the film I was getting sort of used to the pacing and direction, but then the very last minute just ruined everything for me because it was like fitting in 15 minutes of a movie into 60 seconds and it was crazy. The writing was fine. I actually enjoyed Ray's dialogue because it was fun and it seemed like they new how Ray Charles actually spoke. The crazy pacing in the movie really was a big fault in the film and that's what made me dislike the film a bit.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0After that little rant, let me put a little light into the review with the thing in this film that put my score at least 40 % higher. Jamie Foxx won an Oscar for portraying Mr. Charles and boy does he deserve it. The acting in this film was crazy good. Jamie Foxx did an excellent job with portraying Ray and he hit everything in his performance. He had the wield walk, the stuttering and the high voice that Charles has and it's just great to watch Foxx actin this movie. Not only does he spot on his Charles in this movie, he also puts so much emotional depth into his role that I actually started to forget about the messy direction and give this film 9 or 10. The great thing about the way Ray's character is made\u00a0is that he is portrayed as actually, a real doucebag. You'd normally feel sympathy for a disabled person in film, but this movie shows his real gritty side and we figure that he's as much of a jerk as the rest of the people harassing him in the movie. It's basically saying that just because Ray is blind, doesn't mean that he's any better than anyone else. Its a true testament to staying honest to Ray Charles and showing how he really was. \u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0 I really liked the look of the film. The lighting was dark and And layered with brown and black color platelets. This showed that Rat's life was full of darkness and sad times. The editing was trash. Sorry to be so harsh but yes, the editing was sh*t. There were so many fast cuts and quick shots that my head began to hurt. The scenes moved by too fast and the movie never stopped or calmed down. I think Taylor Hackford wad in a giant rush to tell the depressing story of Ray Charles life so he told the editor to cut out half the movie. There was just so much sloppy pacing and just crappy editing. Of course in a movie about a musician there had to be music from that musician, and it is FANTASTIC. Other than Jaimie Foxx's performance, the music in the movie was the best part. It great to hear Ray Charles's fabulous music play throughout the movie bringing a vibrant life to the film. I swear, if they played Ray Charles music in every movie known to mankind, then even \"The Happening\" wouldn't suck. That's right, \"The Happening\" wouldn't suck i tell you.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0\"Ray\" is a pretty good biography about a troubled blind man who just couldn't \u00a0get a hold of himself. It was an engaging film and fun to watch Jaimie Foxx give the performance of his career. But, with the terrible pacing, crazy direction, and just so fast that we never get time to breathe, I'm giving \"Ray\" a 70%. This is a movie with great acting and wonderful music, but it becomes a poor biography in its sloppy direction and very, very, very quick pace.\u00a0\r\n\r\nRecommendation: It has its highs and lows, but Jaimie Foxx's performance is good enough for you to get into this movie and be engaged throughout.",

            "content": "Ray Charles life, a very musical filled festival of horror and happiness, is an interesting one, and seems very honest. And that's the way this film mostly seems. It felt completely honest, probably one of the most honest films I've ever seen, ending the movie on a dark note, which usually most biographies dont do. Ray shows the high points of Ray's career, but mostly concentrates and delves deeply into it's low points, and I respect the film a lot for that. It keeps you paying attention, and although Ray Charles and his music are likeable for the most part through the film, it lets you see a very dark side of him and portrays him a lot as a douchebag. And if a film can make a blind man look like a douchebag, there's something special in it. Another factor I greatly enjoyed about Ray is that it didn't fully concentrate on Charle's disability. Yes, it showed the origin story of his blindess, but rather than being all about him being a great blind musician, it concentrates on the man himself. It didn't concentrate on the great blind man he was, but rather on the great MAN he was. The filmed portrayed him as one of the greatest musicians of all time, not because he was blind and could play well, but because in reality he was a fantastic musician, better than most at the time. The film wants you to understand even if Ray wasn't blind, his dark times would still be with him, and he wouldn't be a greater musician than he was if he could see. His blindness in a film is a small side plot addressed only a limited times in the film, and you are instead concentrated on this great man who can play amazing music. And that's why I love Ray. It's an excellent film that shows a great musician through his highs and lows, and simply that. Pushing his blindness aside, the film wanted to show you a great man who made mistakes in his life, and ones he had trouble fixing. An enthralling film, I thought Ray was a great film. And it was all the better with Jamie Foxx at the lead.\r\n\r\n   The performances in Ray are fantastic, from the minor characters to the supporting cast, to the lead role of Ray Charles, portrayed by none other than Jamie Foxx. At first I thought his performance was all right, getting a little annoyed with it, but as the film progressed I truly believed I was watching Ray Charles and the image of Jamie Foxx dissapeared. Jamie's ability to make you love and dislike a blind man is amazing, and just not the fact he was blind made Jamie a great actor, but the fact that Ray Charles character was so dark and understood the world even without seeing made his character all the more difficult to play, but Foxx pulls it off like a pro. Foxx redefines playing a role and getting into it, for during the course he kept his eyes shut tightly close, which I'm sure caused some harm to him, and showed he was actually acting blind the whole time. A pure honest performance is executed this way, and I loved almost every minute of it. The supporting cast was also great, especially by Ray's mistresses. They have the most put on their shoulders by Ray Charles, and they feel the most pain throughout. I believe all of them should've have received Oscar nominations, if not at least Regina King. Her performance as Margery was violent and excellent, and her anger clearly reflected on screen. Kerry Washington gave a good performance to as Ray Charles's wife. She brought the innocent and scared priest's daughter feel, and when she lost it, you understood she lost it. The entire cast were great in the film, and it was all neatly pulled together Jamie Foxx.\r\n\r\n   The direction is not something I was very happy about. I think it was the weakest part of the entire film, mostly in the beginning. It didn't know how to execute the film until halfway through when things finally turned solid and stayed on a straight path. Before that, everything was not as seamless as it could've been. Taylor Hackford did a good job keeping the film light when it was supposed to be light, and making it dark when it turned dark. But as Ray Charles was growing to be a famous man in America, Taylor Hackford was keeping the film messy and I couldn't have gone on had it not been for Foxx's  performance and the screenplay. The screenplay was written James L. White, who I give a lot of props to for making a story about Ray Charles about Ray Charles, and not his inability to see. It's sad this is the only film he has ever written, but like Harper Lee, it's a dang good one. He kept the film on a light feel at the beginning, showing Ray's highs and his naivity. But as Ray became more famous, he also became more sinister, and I thought that was excellence on White's part. \r\n\r\n    Ray Charles also included an excellent variety of music by the man himself. This was fun, but wasn't the main attraction of the film. Jamie Foxx and the films moral message and plot are the three things that neatly keeps Ray an excellent film. Although the direction was flawed at the beginning, as well as Foxx's performance, it all became solid and more deeply intriguing toward the second act and on. In the end, Ray is an astounding film, with great performances by the cast and a beautiful and honest performance by Jamiee Foxx, and a plot to keep you fully intrigued. One of the best biopics I've seen in a bit, Ray is one no one should miss. 8/10",

Though the entire cast performs wonderfully, Mr. Foxx earned more than simply an Oscar. If it were possible to nominate an actor in consecutive years, I would consider doing so for Mr. Foxx. Foxx doesn't just play Charles, he re-creates him. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother (the inspiration of his life) and young Ray. These two provided the strongest support in the film.The dramas of Charles' struggles with guilt, the death of his younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, addiction, and success, are neatly woven into the tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful, the script is, as far as I can tell, great, and the acting is nothing short of legendary.The directorial method of the film warrants discussion. Taylor Hackford - a director I am generally ambivalent about - had to choose what aspects of the larger-than-life and complex life story of Mr. Charles would tell his story most honestly, dramatically, and understandably. Though some disagree (seemingly wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopic) I believe he selected his themes admirably. A big part of the success of this film is its consistent focus on a few persistent themes in Charles' life - his profound love and respect for his mother, his need to be loved and accepted, his addiction and guilt complex, his musical genius, and his deep-seated fear of responsibility for others. Charles is depicted as a man struggling valiantly against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could have imagined about one of the men I used to listen to on my old turntable with my dad in his livingroom on Sunday nights while football games were on the TV. And nothing was sugar-coated in \"Ray.\" The themes are carried forward with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama which span the length of his long and illuminated life.",

Definitely one of the better biopics I have seen, surpassing the likes of Ali and Dreamgirls, and supports the idea that it is better to watch these types of films with little previous knowledge on the celebrity. The role a blind musician with drug abuse problems is bound to get any competent actor noticed when award nominations roll by but it doesn't make that character any easier to play and the credit given to Jamie Foxx is deserved. Followed clich\u00e9s in the relationship/fallouts  between characters in the 'rise and fall' stories but if they were the true events then I guess it would have been wrong to stray to far away. In conclusion, 'Ray' is a well structured biopic which is successful in leaving you with a much better knowledge and appreciation of the talented man and his music.",

The film shows him recording some of his greatest hits, including the number ones \"Hit the Road Jack,\" \"I Can't Stop Loving You,\" and \"Georgia on My Mind.\" Included in the film are a number of his recordings, originally sung by the master but also sung by the actor portraying him, Jaime Foxx. I would not call that good of a film based on several reasons. One, I think Foxx was too muscular to be an appropriately replica of the famed, blind singer. Two, I found the flashback sequences to his childhood to be distracting and odd. Finally, the movie seemed fairly to downbeat at times, portraying Charles too negatively. I think this film could have been done a whole letter, but I am not sure how. I also think that the Best Actor winner for the year 2004 should have been either Leonardo di Caprio for \"The Aviator,\" Clint Eastwood for \"Million Dollar Baby,\" or Don Cheadle for \"Hotel Rwanda.\" Foxx, I am afraid, was the wrong recipient, although it is not a bad performance, just an okay one.",

Now bear in mind, this was from watching the extended version of the film.  I don't know if it matter or not, though I get the feeling that it might, but be aware of that if it is necessary all the same.\r\n\r\nPlot: This is the story of Ray Charles Robinson, a blind piano player who starts to move up into the world and become a famous singer getting worldwide fame while going through a lot of bad stuff in his life such as having affairs and especially doing drugs.\r\n\r\nThis was a very well put together movie. It may be a little long, but they used it very well with showing us this person and just about every single thing he goes through as his career slowly but surly get bigger and bigger, along with the things in his personal life whether it has to do with his family or with his past. Sure some stuff might not be accurate, I mean I would guess how they say he came up with \"Hit The Road Jack\" was not how he did it. I'm sure I could be wrong but that's my guess. But whether or not there was anything inaccurate to it, they still give us a very interesting story. Now the ending *WARNING SPOILER* I personally liked. Because frankly, from what I guessed from what little I saw from this movie until now, and with the fact that I didn't know much about Ray Charles up till now, I thought this was going to be one of those movies where the main character has it all, but he keeps making the wrong choices that screw him over beyond repair whether it's relationships like Kane's two wives in Citizen Kane, or with both relationships and the person's whole career like Roy Hobbs in The Natural (the book mind you, not the movie). But how it turned out for Ray in the end was a little satisfying because of how things worked out. I will admit that the ending is not too original, and I thought it was a little fast, that it was still nice to know what happened. *END OF SPOILERS*\r\n\r\n\r\nActors/Characters:\r\nJamie Foxx/Ray Charles: Foxx did a spectacular job. He gave us a good idea with what Charles did and what he went through with the things that happened throughout his life. Now part of how I know he did a good job was the fact that I had just recently saw him in Horrible Bosses. Comparing his character in that movie to his character in Ray shows how he gave a totally different character that he did work really hard on.\r\n\r\nMusic: what's to say, with this film we hear a lot of music that we all know and love. \"Mess Around\", \"Hit the Road Jack,\" I can just go on.\r\n\r\nEditing: I liked the editing. It was interesting how they especially kept showing those bottles that were on that tree from his childhood home.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for Ray. It's an amusing film with a entertaining story about Ray Charles. The ending may be fast and cheesy, but it still works out anyway.",

However, the narrative doesn't shy away from depicting Charles' rampant infidelities and his struggles with heroin addiction. Jamie Foxx, who picked up an Oscar for this part, definitely adds humanity to the portrayal of an icon. While Ray pretty much hits upon the same tropes as all other musical biopics, Foxx's strong performance makes this picture worthy of one's time.",

With that being said, I'm not sure there was a whole lot else about this movie that made it worth while. The story at times was intriguing and emotional, but often times uneventful and redundant. The fact of the matter is, once you get by the tragic childhood and blindness that he overcame to turn himself into one of the worlds finest musicians, Ray's life just wasn't very interesting. Most of the movie could have been about any great modern musician- basically just a lot of sex drugs and rock n roll. Foxx still managed to carry this one to becoming a decent view- but just the shear excessive length -on its own- would deter me from watching it again.",

Hackford produces a complex, unflattering portrait of Ray Charles that never shies away from his haughty behavior. Jamie Foxx gives a performance that is astonishingly vigorous. Lip synching to the songs, Foxx captures the physicality and vocal tonality of Charles with brilliant precision. Foxx gives an intuitive interpretation that rises above impersonation. As a biopic the movie plays more like a greatest hits collection than a completed work. It merely touches on the racial and disability discrimination he faced in favor of standard scenes of promiscuity and the descent into drug addiction. Flashbacks to his childhood trauma as the means for explaining Charles' erratic behavior is too simplistic. Hackford's storytelling and filmmaking is conventional but the musical numbers have the extraordinary vitality that made Ray Charles such an inclusionary artist. Foxx won an Oscar as Best Actor. Musical numbers include: \"Mess Around,\" \"I Got a Woman,\" \"What'd I Say,\" \"Georgia on My Mind,\" \"Hit the Road Jack,\" \"Unchain My Heart.\" With Kerry Washington as Ray's wife Della Charles, Regina King, Terrence Howard, Larenz Tate as Quincy Jones, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong, Wendell Pierce, Warwick Davis, Richard Schiff, CJ Sanders as Young Ray, Sharon Warren as Ray's mother.",
