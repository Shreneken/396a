I have to say it felt like a off kilter rehash of the first 2 films structure for the first 30 minutes or so and as the plot unfolded I was sucked in slowly. The cinematography and special effects are very well done with a lot of variety that seems a bit lacking consistency but as the plot progresses it becomes clearer why its needed to tell such a sharp and original story. The only 2 things that are slightly lacking is the music is solid but not as memorable as the first two and while the acting in this is the strongest of the three so far it still has the 3 main characters not being up to snuff with the supporting cast though it is there best performances by far. Those are so minor because of how strong this plot and direction is it does not matter at all in the grand scheme. It is worth seeing the first 2 films just to see this one.",

This entry is another drastic step up from the previous film and the tone takes a dramatic shift in terms of seriousness.\n\nThe quality and cinematography are simply brilliant in this film. There are so many amazing shots and sequences that just had me completely enamored. These films are ahead of their time for sure.\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has the best plot of the series so far. There is a constant threat looming in the background throughout the entire film that is known from the opening minutes. Sirius Black's menacing posters and headlines create a real sense of danger, and he truly seems mad. The dementors also deliver a serious threat on screen. Their introduction is terrifying, and their presence is felt in every scene.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this film is the conclusion, the time traveling elements are perfect and answer so many questions that I had when running through the finale the first time. My fiancé and I were very confused at how things were happening, and I was having a hard time believing it. But it was brilliant the way it looped around, and the audience was given more background information that made those scenes complete.\n\nThe trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint elevate their performances once again. Their chemistry is amazing, and I have a feeling this complement will be handed out during every film until the conclusion. Gary Oldman was fantastic as Sirius Black and one of the more compelling \"villains\" of the series so far. Michael Gambon does an excellent job filling in for the late Richard Harris, it was really difficult to even tell that it was a different actor.\n\nMy only complaint about this film was the beginning of the movie was slightly rushed. I felt like from when Harry left the Dursley's to when he arrived at Hogwarts the audience was whipped around from location to location, and it was hard to keep track of why. But the plot settles in and finds it's groove after that and delivers a near perfect conclusion.\n\nScore: 87%\nVerdict: Excellent",

Wearing muggle clothes more often, darker themes and straying away slightly (but not too much) from the books helped elevate this film to new heights. \n\nI truly believe that if Prisoner of Azkaban would have flopped, the series would not have been finished. Thankfully Alfonso Cuarón is a filmmaking legend, and this film is at the top of the Harry Potter list. \n\nBest Character: Remus Lupin (honorable mention to Sirius)\nBest Scene: \"Buckbeak's Flight\" and \"The Final Patronus\" are amazing (top 10 all-time HP moments), but my favorite is \"Inside the Shrieking Shack\". \nBest Quote: \"The ones that love us never really leave us and you can always find them... in here.\" - Sirius\nBest Piece of Score: \"Buckbeak's Flight\" and \"Finale\"",

The three principal actors were on good form here.\nAll in all, a very good, although imperfect follow up that probably could have benefited from Chris Columbus directing skills.",

            "content": "NO SPOILER REVIEW:\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban:\n\nThe Prisoner of Azkaban is the best Harry Potter film, here's why: \nNot only have I watched this film like 20 times, but every time I re-watch it, I find something new that I hadn't realised before, like the OBVIOUS foreshadowing, and we have the director to thank.\nAlfonso Cuarón (Roma, Gravity) is the director, this was his first and only Harry Potter film he has directed and he did a brilliant job directing this film, Prisoner of Azkaban is relatively darker to the previous films, even the weather alone makes the film just look drearier and less colourful than the \"usual\" Harry Potter look.\nThe lighting in the film is also brilliant, the use of light in certain scenes is almost genius. The lighting in the normal muggle world vs the magical world is different showing a clear difference and showing how bland and boring the ordinary muggle world is compared to Hogwarts.\nAs well as this, the cinematography takes a bit of a turn as well, the cinematography is much more diverse than the previous (and future) films overall. I believe this to be the most \"unique\" Harry Potter film out of the 8. They use many techniques like tracking shots, low angle shots, long shots, medium shots, etc. Which up to this point, we had never really seen a lot of experimentation with the different camera shots and techniques used, so in a way this film is a fresh start for Harry Potter. \nThe cast is absolutely perfect as well, we have such brilliant actors and actresses like Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, David Thewis, Emma Thompson, Michael Gambon, all some of the finest and best British actors/actresses ever. The actors/actresses all fit their roles perfectly and I think that they followed the book pretty closely, Meeting Sirius Black for the first time will never not be an amazing scene in cinema, in which, Gary Oldman really does brilliantly in this film, he fits the character perfectly and his talent really shines. \n\nHowever, it's not all great. For example, at certain points in the film you can tell what's going to happen before anything actually happens, which I feel is a shame, but except for that the film is a flawless piece of film that I will forever cherish and love. This film was the most unique, best acted film in the whole series. I would highly recommend that you watch this movie, even if you don't like Harry Potter. Just make sure to watch the previous 2 films first so you're all caught up. 😊\n\nP.S. This was my first review and I hope that it didn't suck. Thank you for reading.",

Con un idioma cinematografió mas notorio que en las pasadas entregas. Con alegorías y simbolismos bien marcados en el transcurso de la historia. Los efectos especiales para esta película están mas pulidos y en varios momentos puedes notar esa ambición del estudio por hacerlo diferente. Aunque tanto la historia como los personajes siguen siendo simples y con un desarrollo predecible, la historia es disfrutable y te regala clips muy buenos, con giros de trama impredecibles que te hacen interesarte por la trama de la misma, para mi la película se eleva en el 3 acto. Ya que se llega de manera muy natural a esa tan ansiada escena climática (La escena de Harry vs los Dementores) una escena simplemente espectacular, con muchos matices y mostrando el que para mi es el mensaje de la película, La esperanza opaca el juicio de quien la posee, con un Harry esperanzado con la idea de tener una familia y de ver a su padre, siendo oscurecido por sus propias ambiciones, un mensaje mas profundo y para mi mas satisfactorio. Estamos viendo la evolución de los personajes, personajes que poco a poco dejan de tener obstáculos menores, para centrarse en verdaderos desafíos, tanto personales como en la trama. Esta película es increíble, no te aburre y te mantiene intrigado, con personajes increíbles que llegan a esta saga, la misma aún tiene mucho que contar. Una película ambiciosa que supo como llegarle al espectador.",

It has expanded the world from the last film, but not so far as to distract from the story, and at this point, enough of the world has been established that it's not as distracting as it was in Chamber of Secrets.  This allows the film just enough room to breath and everything is seemingly working in harmony with each other.  While the films have gotten progressively darker, it is done appropriately so.  Harry Potter is growing older and more experienced, so his day-to-day problems as a wizard should reflect that--all the while edging closer to his confrontation with \"He who won't be named\".",

It's worth noting that the director changed from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuarón. \n\nEven though this is the third, I'm still amazed at the new magic tricks that the source material created. They also became goofier and funnier. The CGI was decent for the most part, but some were noticeably bad. \n\nThe biggest change from the first two was the story, which became more complexed and involved playing with time. This came with a problem for me: in the first hour and a half, I felt like the story was going nowhere, and the pieces were random. However, the ending act tied everything together and explained what happened a lot, perhaps more than it needed to, but probably for the young audiences to follow. \n\nEven though it's 20 minutes shorter than the second one, the runtime still felt very long, mostly because of the set up that seemed to go nowhere at first. It would be better if the story moved faster and connected the pieces sooner. \n\nOverall, I'm still amazed at how well and creative the script and source material used its universe to entertain audience. The story was more complex, which was good and enjoyable, but nonetheless still felt too long and lost me couple of times. 7/10",

            "content": "After watching The Chamber of Secrets I was a bit skeptical to continue watching the franchise. That was what I had in mind when I began watching this - Will it also show filthy, cringy characters? Is there going to be terrible CGI with literally no beautiful locations? Are there going to be tons of disgusting scenes? Turns out this movie is better in terms of all those things. And definitely worth a watch if you haven't done it already (I know you muts have, I am the only 90's-born stooge who still hasn't watched this series).\n\nThe story this time takes a much dark, complicated turn. In the beginning of the movie itself Harry kills his aunt, or so it seems since it has been left ambiguously. He doesn't even hesitate from using his magical powers to scare his family anymore, although it is never explained how his uncle knows that he's not allowed to use his powers. This time, just like every other time he is to escape from home and go to Hogwarts station. But this time he does it in a bus being driven by a ghost. I like how every time Harry has to escape from home it always happens in a funny and wholesome manner. Those are the scenes that I could watch forever without getting tired.\n\nAs the series is progressing, Harry Potter is having a higher budget, which is clearly visible by the fact that now it is following the \"show, don't tell\" principle of storytelling way more often. And that's why the story is using a lot less runtime giving exposition or conversations but rather on actually doing things. I learnt this the hard way. I was doing my project on my computer while watching the movie on the phone, and I missed a lot of scenes and had to rewind to see them again. This is a habit that I had developed from the last two movies of the franchise. And I'm really happy to see that supposedly the Potterheads must have really enjoyed seeing it in the theatres or wherever they saw it. They wouldn't have wasted any time on the talkikng scenes like sci-fi movies normally do.\n\nHowever, I am more used to having Harry Potter having a simple story, just like the movies of that time like Narnia and Lord of the Rings. I was doing a project while watching the movie on my phone, so I stopped seeing the movie for like, 5 minutes and by then everything had changed. I never understood when Harry and Hermione went to the past and what exactly were they trying to change. I also didn't know who that guy was who sat on the flying creature and flew away. Also what finally happened of the Dementor, I completely missed out on that part.\n\nThere is something about the Harry Potter movies that stops me from wanting to watch them, and I have no idea why. I also get this feeling with Stuart Little and Narnia. So I can't say for a guarantee that I will rewatch it to watch the scenes that I skipped. Although this movie is a major improvement over Chamber of Secrets, it doesn't match the standard that Sorcerer's Stone has set. I have heard enough about Harry Potter and how much it means to everyone, but personally for me it's not a franchsie I could possibly bond with for some reason. I hope I change my mind soon after future movies.",

What I can't understand is how this is still seen as the best of the entire series after both the 4th and 6th movies were leaps and bounds better than this one was. I get the appeal of an \"auteur\" filmmaker being given a gigantic budget and seeing what he can do with it, but he's hampered here by having to adapt the least-best novel of the series and the creative choices he makes end up not overcoming that and in some cases make the issue worse. Far more than either of the first two movies there's an overwhelming lack of allowing scenes to breathe and a marked increase in intentional confusion. He excises important plot points from the book that would've made the movie make more sense but uses the running time this affords him to focus on trivial things like lingering wide-angle shots of the castle & grounds, all while still condensing the movie to a shorter runtime than those with much simpler plots had been given. The beginning of the plot climax that readers would recognize happens all of a sudden and it's an absolute sprint to get to the finish from there, with only a scant few minutes spent on the confrontation with Sirius and no time even alotted for Cuaron's style to shine through as it's just nonstop book-plot crammed into the final ~35 minutes of running time. This is, to me, the least-best movie in the series as it has nearly all the same faults as the first two without any sense of wonder or amazement. It's especially inferior to later installments with superior plots, acting and special effects. Anyway, I still loved watching it as it's impossible to make a bad Harry Potter movie.",

My only compliant is that it cut out the back story of the original maurders and I only simply wished I could have had 10 more hours of all of this that I was gleefully observing. (Harry, Ron and Hermione) -Radcliff, Grint and Watson do my favorite incarnations of the trio in all of the eight adapted films. They perfectly captured what I had in my mind while reading the book. The cinematography and music was masterful. John Williams gave his greatest orchestral piece in all of this great potter universe of incredible music. The production design by Stuart Craig is masterful and reaches new heights in elegance, naturalism, beauty and whimsical glory.  This is why I put Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban in my top 25 favorite films of all-time. It was beyond what could have imagined.

The mischievous trio are back in their third year at Hogwarts.\n\nPotter (Daniel Radcliffe) is a slightly different character in this film as the anger inside of him for what happened to his parents has grown over the years. This made, for me, the film much more enjoyable than the first and second.\n\nAs one would no doubt assume, Gary Oldman's portrayal of the character Sirius Black is nothing less than perfect. However, Sirius Black seams an unlikely roll for the talented Oldman. I enjoyed him more in other films, such as 'The Professional' and 'Immortal Beloved'. Let us hope he has had the chance to 'play it up' a bit more in the much anticipated 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'.\n\nThe original music of John Williams is more than I could ever hope to hear. It is absolutely splendid, making the film worth a listen even if you do not watch. Williams has created memorable compositions such as the theme music to 'Star Wars', 'Jaws' and 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'.\n\nOverall, any age should enjoy this film. The visual effects are not the most spectacular I've seen, but fantastic enough to take your imagination away from the real world for 141 minutes. Even the closing credits are kind of cool.\n\nNow, go watch the film. You'll be glad you did.",

There's many little easter eggs that are just pure genius. Kinda seems like a Rian Johnson movie. Cinematically, this movie is amazing. The acting is a crap-ton better than the first two, as well. It's much darker. It actually takes out a time-travel inconsistency from the book that always bugged me, and I thought that was great. Again, like the first two, it leaves out an annoying amount of information that was in the first one. But again, unlike the first two, it actually picks up on the story fast enough. The first two was just one thing after another and at the very end of the movie the plot actually starts. It felt disjointed. In this one, it actually has a plot for most of the movie. Even a bunch of well-executed subplots. And the plot twist at the end… it completely captured the essence of the surprise that the book had (even if part of the plot twist in the book had partially had to be fulfilled by information from earlier that the book skimped over). I stand by what I'm about to say- the plot twist in the book and less so the movie, is the greatest plot twist of all time. Better than \"Luke, I am your father.\" Yup. I said it. Now, I wasn't able to experience that twist, because I watching the original trilogy when I was like… two, and then watched the prequel trilogy, and LOVED IT. I remembered absolutely nothing from the original trilogy, but still said I was a die-hard Star Wars fan. So people were able to comfortably talk about \"I am your father\" in front of me, presuming that I already knew about it. I casually took it and slightly remembered it, but for the most part I just never experienced it. THE POINT IS (I bet you forgot I had a point) that I am able to say that the plot twist there is the greatest plot twist of all time, in my opinion. Anyway, back to the movie. The movie is very dark. Chamber and Sorcerer's Stone are pretty childish, and colorful both literally and (in figurative terms) atmospherically. Cinematography-wise, they're very saturated. Alfonso was asked, \"Hey, how bright do you want this movie to be?\" and he responded \"No.\" I love the climax of this movie. It's so dramatic. And honestly, in the books after everyone does all the Scooby-Doo crap (that came off as insulting but honestly I love it, and it's nice to have a little mystery and puzzle-solving in the franchise) the time-travel stuff feels a little rushed. But in this it subverts your expectations (there's a little more Rian Johnson for you) and just when you think you've reached the climax of the movie, BAM, thirty-seven more minutes of time-travel thrown in your face. It's great!\n\nThis movie doesn't have any flaws. So it'd be five stars, right?",

Cuaron crafted some absolutely gorgeous shots, with beautiful cinematography, popping off the screen with a great color pallet. He brings a lot of style to this film, incorporating many long takes, emotional close ups, with seamless editing, that helped the film stand on it's own. Instead of keeping the film more lighthearted, Cuaron brings this darker tone, that elevates the saga to new heights! Chris Columbus seemed to have a tough time focusing on the premise, and fleshing it out, but Cuaron did a fantastic job keeping the narrative tight and cohesive, while still keeping the continuity of the saga. Cuaron utilized amazing imagery, to create a lot of suspense, and twists throughout the narrative, allowing for countless memorable moments! I really don't have many issues with the story or direction; the only nitpicks I have, is that they incorporated a few filler scenes and exposition dumps, but they made things as interesting and entertaining as possible.\n\nEven though, this is very much a story-driven film, Cuaron did not hold back on the amount of genuine character moments between everyone! Cuaron and Kloves did a very good job of balancing all of the characters, trying to give them all more development. Our three leads in, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, all put on great performances, continuously working on their genuine chemistry. The new characters in Gary Oldman, David Thewill, Timothy Spall, and Michael Gambon were all great additions to the story, all putting on enthusiastic performances, fitting the scheme perfectly.\n\nThe screenplay by Steve Kloves, was by far the best one yet! The script was written so well, having so much intricate detail. The comedy was interwoven beautifully, not being forced in and ruining the tone. You can tell that Kloves knows his Harry Potter, and continues on making great screenplays.\n\nThe Prisoner of Azkaban took full advantage of fleshing out their world, and their magic! Cuaron digs deeper on the magic, giving us so many entertaining sequences! Cuaron and the art directors crafted so many brilliantly looking sets, looking completely authentic, with amazing detail, making you feel like you were actually at Hogwarts.\n\nOverall, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban has so much to offer, with a brilliantly shot film, amazing characters, and beautiful looking set pieces!",

Alfonso Cuaron is such a gifted filmmaker, he knew exactly how to handle the story this time around by only including the main plots and sub-plots that directly affect Harry which gave him time to graft in some really good character-building moments, this is the shortest film so far and it is a breath of fresh air to not be too faithful to the source material, he really tweaked it around a bit to make it a more cohesive and structured narrative. Columbus' first two films have a distinct style and a tone of child-like awe and wonder, but this film shows you that not all magic is good and it is even darker than the last film. The acting all around is very good including newcomers David Thewlis and Gary Oldman who were both likable characters, especially Thewlis who is given a lot of time to develop a relationship with Harry and we see how much he genuinely wants to help him. The cinematography is gorgeous, it brings Hogwarts to life with a great dark and dreary color palette, you feel the dementors sucking your joy away just from the colors and the way it is shot. The CGI is massively improved from the last two films and it is used only when necessary which maximizes the effectiveness of it. Emma Thompson plays another new character and she is strange, but she works her way into the plot nicely and I like her as an actress. Buckbeak the Hippogriff is awesome, it gives you a sense of grandeur and hope in this otherwise bleak feeling film, seeing Hagrid teaching is great and his love for animals is so heartwarming, I liked seeing his characters have more to do this time around. The Dursleys are back in the beginning with an entertaining sequence of a lady inflating like a balloon, Richard Harris is still the most underrated actor in the series. This movie has the least to do with the overarching theme of Voldemort in the entire series, this kind of feels like a spinoff in that sense and it makes a great small scale feel and I like those types of movies. Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore really works for me, he is not old and fragile anymore, he actually moves around the castle and is livelier. The time travel can get confusing, but it all works and creates a great feeling of unpredictability. The Quidditch match was short and not a lot happened which disappointed me a bit. The only issues I have with this film is that it leans a little too heavy on comedy and it doesn't always work, I liked the comedic undertones and it mostly worked, just a couple jokes fell flat for me; the other issue is that I never liked how Werewolf Lupin looked, it is just weird, it needed more hair, a darker skin color, and look less human-like, but it is still scary nonetheless. This is the best-directed film in the series, the CGI is greatly improved, it goes darker and it works, there are actually a few good jokes, the story is very precise and cohesive but still allows for character growth, the acting is really good all around, the script is excellent, and the cinematography is amazing.

I just wished they included the Marauders story as that hasn't scratched the surface at all in this movie and the ending was cringe but this movie is still amazing. The Marauders map is a great addition to the story as well and the acting is still amazing,\nOverall: 9.25/10 (A)",

Of course, there is a concern for Hogwarts as the inevitable fight between good and evil continues once again. Yet, I found the eventual plot twist so distasteful and unbelievable that it crashed my suspension of belief & ruined the film for me.\n\nThis movie is a bit darker than the previous two films before it.

The kids are actually dressed like real school kids this time. Not all smarty but some have shirts untucked and ties not done up properly which gives it a very authentic feel. They look like they dressed themselves. Which they probably were asked to. Great choice. The music is good here. John Williams does a great job.

            "content": "A mind bending caper to refresh the Harry Potter franchise.\n\nAlfonso Cuarón's dark fantasy adventure feature Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) is a bolt of artistic energy that ensured the Harry Potter series would remain unique each film with a bold new Gothic aesthetic. Cuarón's direction is flawless as he executes a complex time travel concept for the third Harry Potter picture. His arthouse sensibilities make for a creative display of directorial prowess with a clear vision for how things should proceed. Steven Weisberg's editing is nifty as he cuts together various takes and sequences together to keep time travelling linearly for the audience to make sense of a strange and intricate plot.\n\nMichael Seresin's cinematography is striking with unique angles, long panning shots, and shifting perspectives. His wide shots outdoors are so breathtaking and more natural than previous installments of Harry Potter. You get a real feel for Hogwarts' surroundings. The production design is darker and dingier than before too to keep things gritty. Elizabeth Lewis' make-up is very natural, letting actors look normal. Likewise, Jany Temime and Davis Crossman's costumes opt for modern fashions and contemporary clothes to keep Harry and his friends relatable to teens of the time. It's a bold, risky choice that pays off.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe is fantastic as an eager Harry Potter, full of anxiety and dread. Rupert Grint is funny as always as the bumbling and steadfast Ron Weasley. Gary Oldman is frantic and endearing as Sirius Black, while David Thewlis is likable and kind as Harry's new professor against the dark arts and mentor Remus Lupin. Alan Rickman is still entertaining and likable as Severus Snape with his unforgiving glares and quiet menace. His eagerness for vengeance is particularly interesting here as a setup for future Harry Potter films. Tom Felton does more with less as the cruel bully Draco Malfoy. Timothy Spall makes an unforgettable cameo as Peter Pettigrew. James and Oliver Phelps come into their own as brilliant comedy relief as Fred and George Weasley.\n\nJ. K. Rowling's novel and Steve Kloves' script is clever as Harry Potter and his friends grow up into teenagers dealing with unsure feelings and strong moral convictions. Harry Potter must deal with fear and rage, while learning forgiveness alongside new defensive spells. Hermione saves the day with a brilliant leading performance from Emma Watson as the confident genius witch Hermione Granger. Rowling's writing matured with her audience. Great writing is what captured kids' imagination watching Harry Potter for a decade and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a prime example.\n\nBonnie Wright is still adorable as Ginny Weasley, although my only gripe is that she doesn't get enough screen time in Prisoner of Azkaban.\n\nMichael Gambon takes up the challenge to replace the late Richard Harris, rest in peace, who kindly Albus Dumbledore endeared his wizard character to an entire generation. Gambon excels as a knowledgeable and helpful wizard in his own way, without trying to do an impression of Harris. I'll always prefer Harris' nice and friendly Dumbledore, but Gambon seems powerful and cooler. Robbie Coltrane is still lovable as Rubeus Hagrid. Maggie Smith is still excellent as Minerva McGonagall, while Emma Thompson is wonderful as the strange seer Sybill Trelawney.\n\nJohn Williams' score is darker and more subdued than his bright and whimsical compositions for the first two Harry Potter movies. Chris Columbus' childlike sense of wonder is gone and replaced with Alfonso Cuarón's stark realism and dark tendencies, so Williams' music adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a smart, fast, dark, and cool fantasy movie for all teenagers.",

Rowling's novel of the same name and which is the third instalment in the Harry Potter film series.\nThis movie is where the franchise starts to get darker while its core audience gets more mature. Alfonso Cuarón brings a dark tale which feels like a Soviet revenge story and it's so good!\nThe story follows Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts as he is informed that a prisoner named Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban and intends to kill him.\nI feel like Daniel Radcliffe is the weakest actor in this movie. That's unfortunate because all of these focus around him, and this is one of the most important movies in the series. When he was in a scene leaning his Patronus with Professor Lupin, he was good, and I was invested. But when he learns a secret about Sirius Black and gets angry, he doesn't do a good job at showing emotion. It took me out a bit. However, everybody else brings their A-Game. Gary Oldman being brought into the series is fantastic, and this is the first time we see Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is fine, but I did find myself missing Richard Harris as the soft spoken and wise Professor.\nThis is the ‘Harry Potter' film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. The plot contains the requisite amounts of twists and turns. And above all else it is beautifully shot and edited.\nOverall, in my opinion this is the best in the series. It has so much story to tell and adds important characters to the main story of the series.\n4.5/5",

Visually and dramatically, they've grown into their roles, and director Alphonso Cuarón lets them flaunt that newfound independence in his only take on the series. The school feels more lived-in and tangible, as opposed to the amusement park it seemed in the first two movies, and its residents (particularly the three central Hogwarts kids) are less buttoned-up and disciplined, more comfortable with their surroundings. It's also darker and more foreboding, foreshadowing the idea that this series was headed into stormy waters.\n\nAdding Gary Oldman to the mix seems a good choice, though he does little more than snarl and growl menacingly, Michael Gambon plays a more vibrant Dumbledore in relief of the late Richard Harris, and the returning cast all do well in their established roles. The plot flitters around for quite a while, however, obsessing over excessive amounts of day-in-the-life snapshots and unrelated asides. That does confirm the sense of wonder that's been imbued in this world since day one, but it also makes the plot feel extra slow and padded-out.\n\nThe effects work has improved since The Chamber of Secrets, even if it still shows some cobwebs (particularly during the whomping willow ride). That progress could be attributed to a strict limit on house elves and quidditch matches, which were both prime suspects in the more eye-rolling segments of the preceding film. Prisoner is fair enough, with a meatier plot and a more tangible landscape. And, huzzah, the greater narrative does finally begin to move somewhere interesting. Alas, I still can't quite figure what all the fuss is about with this series. Maybe one had to grow up reading the novels.",

            "content": "Alfonso Cuarón's masterful adaptation does the source material immeasurable justice by exploring its underlying concepts in an intelligent manner. Of course, it certainly helps that the aesthetics of the film are incredible, the acting remains stellar (and the trio of young actors handle their roles admirably), and John Williams offers an amazing (and eclectic) score. Character development is superb - Steve Kloves penned a great script.\n\nFirst-time and young viewers will likely enjoy the film for its merits based on plot and 'adventure' alone, but it takes multiple viewings and a critical eye to enjoy the abstract ideas and nuances. Cuarón himself credited the source material as being laden with real-world issues: oppression, racism, loneliness, power, friendship, justice and so forth.\n\nThis is the Harry Potter film that stands on its own and as a tremendous cinematic achievement. It challenges viewers and yet doesn't patronize them or attempt to offer answers to all of the questions presented. For instance, the ending is bittersweet at best and retains a healthy amount of ambiguity.\n\nIf you've never read the books or understood the acclaim of the series as a whole, watch Cuarón's 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and you'll understand why this entry is clearly the zenith of the seven.f there's anything this movie proves, it is the difficulty in separating the series from the demands of fans. This is clear just from hearing some of the comments. \"Why didn't they identify the names on the Marauder's Map?\" \"Why wasn't the second Quidditch game shown?\" \"Why wasn't there more of Crookshanks the Cat?\" By focusing on what the film didn't have, fans fail to look at the film on its own terms. I think this is by far the best Harry Potter movie yet.\n\nThe only way to satisfy fans would be to include everything from the book, which would require a miniseries. Since that isn't what these films are, the story has to be abridged. The first two films tried to fit everything they could within a reasonable slot of time. The result was a set of films that felt cluttered yet incomplete. Had they continued with this strategy for this movie, based on a much longer book, it would surely have been over three hours long.\n\nThe virtue of the latest film is that it makes a real attempt to adapt the story, not just marching in lockstep with the book's events. The screenplay is sparing, leaving out or simplifying loads of details not directly relevant to the plot. But it captures much of the book's delight and humor. The first two films fell short in this regard, because they lacked the guts to tinker with the details, even though that was the key to condensing the story while staying true to its spirit.\n\nThe movie is still faithful to the book, of course. Many of the scenes are exactly as I had imagined them. When it deviates, it does so based on an understanding of the story and characters. This is evident in the way they show, for example, the Knight Bus; Hermione's overstuffed schedule; and the introduction of the Marauder's Map, a scene that captures the twins' mischievous personalities. The changes are clever and funny, and they help compensate for the movie's loss in other areas.\n\nCertainly this has something to do with the new director. Columbus's approach was to stick to the books as literally as possible, often draining them of their subtlety. For instance, where the books only hint that Dumbledore can see through the invisibility cloak, the earlier movies make it unmistakable. The new director never condescends to the audience in that way. This is a children's movie, but it is also a fantasy-thriller that we can take seriously, because not everything is spelled out for us. We're given a chance to think.\n\nBut part of what makes the movie work is the book itself. The story is gripping from start to finish, because the threat looming over the school is established early on. Harry's personal life is sharply intertwined with the plot. We feel for him as we watch his disastrous (but hilarious) attempts to escape his uncle and aunt, and his humiliating reaction to the dementors. The story avoids common devices such as the talking killer or deus ex machina, which the other books have in abundance. The ending is nicely bittersweet and ambiguous. The plot is so complicated, however, that the book spends several chapters explaining it all. The movie wisely includes only very little of this, allowing the plot twists to become understood as the story progresses. I was surprised to see certain events that were in the movie but not the book lend support to an important theory some fans have had about what is to be revealed at the end of the series. Of course, it is well-hidden and won't give anything away for those who aren't looking for the clues.\n\nI was so satisfied with the film that it almost seems trivial to mention the flaws, but there are some. The portrayal of Fudge's assistant as the standard hunchbacked dimwit is out of place here, as it would be in anything other than a cartoon or spoof. The most serious misstep, though, is the casting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Gambon's face seems frozen in a perpetual nonexpression, and his voice lacks resonance. He compares poorly to the late Richard Harris, whose line readings had gravity, and who played the character with a twinkle in his eyes. It is a pure mystery to me why this actor was chosen as a replacement, especially considering the fine performances from other members of the cast. Even the children are in top form here.\n\nThose complaints aside, this is the movie I was hoping they would make when the series began. If it doesn't live up to the book, so what? What's important is that it lives up to its potential as a movie. Fans who want a carbon-copy of the book are looking in the wrong place, because they're never going to get it here. This is probably the best example of a Harry Potter movie that we're ever likely to see.Director Alfonso Cuarón has taken the images conjured by J.K. Rowling's magical words and created from her book, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,' a film rife with visual symbolism and alive with inventive images beyond those established by the first two films in the series. Cuarón, a native of Mexico City and the acclaimed director of the completely compelling, frequently hilarious and sexually explicit coming-of-age film, 'Y tu mamá también,' was seen by many as an odd choice to follow heartland American Chris Columbus into the Harry Potter director's chair. The selection has resulted in a film darker and more mature than its predecessors, just as was the book, but it is also as approachable for young people as Cuarón's other internationally heralded work, 'A Little Princess.'\n\nIt is late in the summer. Harry (a decidedly more assertive Daniel Radcliffe, making his third appearance in the leading role) is at the Dursleys in Privet Drive, preparing for his third year at Hogwart's, when an obnoxious relative demeans his father's memory, causing Harry to lose his temper. As a result, Harry violates the rules of student witches and wizards, causing the offending aunt to inflate as a dirigible and float away into the night sky on an stream of invectives. It is a delightful opening to a film with far more serious issues to explore and frightening obstacles to overcome. Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), imprisoned at Azkaban for complicity in the murder of Harry's parents, has escaped, and is looking for Harry. The soul-stealing prison guards called 'Dementors' (Latin for mind-removers) are searching for Black everywhere, but when he and Harry meet, there are revelations which change everything.\n\nThe symbolism in the film is fascinating. Rowling is responsible for a lot of it, but Cuarón has used symbolism as a visual tool to alert the audience to impending danger and to keep tensions high. Traditionally, black-feathered birds such as ravens, crows, and vultures all have negative images associated with them; they are usually used to represent carnage, bloodshed and battle; they are thought of in terms of scavengers, messengers of the dead, and evil. Crows abound in this film, but Cuarón has extended their traditional roles, turning them into symbols of the Dementors, which fly around menacingly in black garments with feather-like hems. Even when the Dementors are out of sight (they are not allowed on the grounds of Hogwart's School) you can feel their presence in the crows.\n\nRowling's most obvious use of symbolism is in the name she gives the escaped prisoner Sirius Black. Sirius is a star in the constellation Canis Majoris (in mythology, Canis Majoris is one of Orion's hunting dogs; the Greater Dog), the brightest star in the sky. So, Sirius is also called the Dog Star, and everyone knows that the dog is distinguished above all other inferior animals for intelligence, docility, and attachment to man. Would she give such a name, with all its implications, to a villainous character? Not likely. But she would give it to a wizard who could change into a dog.\n\nAmong the new visual images are animal ghosts which wander the halls of Hogwart's Castle and the film's realization of Buckbeak the Hippogriff, like Sirius, falsely accused and condemned. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and all of the established characters return. Led by Harry, all the students have matured considerably, as you would expect of 13-year-olds; they are more independent and self assured, more emotionally developed and far less childlike in their reactions and bearing. Michael Gambon is new and effective as Aldus Dumbledore, following the death of Richard Harris. Emma Thompson is wonderfully wacky as Divination Professor Sybil Treelawney; who leaps from the pages of the book and onto the screen as if Rowling had written the character specifically for Thompson. Also new is Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Remus Lupin (David Thewles), who comes to Harry's aid in ways that might befit his Latin name. Remus was the brother of the founder of Rome. In mythology, he was nursed by a she-wolf; Lupin means wolf-like (wolf is Canis Lupis).\n\nThe unheralded thread of creative continuity in this marvelous series, as it moves from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuarón to incoming director Mike Newell (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, now in production) is Screenwriter Steve Kloves. He and the producers have been true to Rowling's works and to Harry's fans, in ways that have always enhanced, not diminished, the author's incredible achievement.",

Believed to have been the right-hand-man of the dark wizard Voldemort, whom Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) mysteriously rendered powerless during his infancy, some of those closest to Harry suspect Black has returned to exact revenge on the boy who defeated his master. \n\nThere's a lot of things to love about the third installment in the franchise, even if it still has a couple of problems. However, it improves upon the mistakes it had made in previous films, while also adding new aspects for us to enjoy. This film is filled with more magic than we have ever seen, while still finding more reasons to love the characters that we've already been introduced to.\n\nThe film starts out with its classic introduction. Harry is having a miserable time at his house with his obviously abusive parents. After conflict, he leaves and makes his way to Hogwarts. There, another threat lurks that puts his life in jeopardy. Along with that, a new Dark Arts teacher (oddly suspicious) arrives and Harry and his friends go on their adventures. It follows the similar format of previous films, but it does a good job of taking a few twists and turns here and there. \n\nI do like this film more than the first two for multiple reasons, ones that aren't neccesarily a negative on the first two films. We do get to see even more progression from our third year characters. Harry is growing up and wants to learn more about his family, Ron and Hermione grow a tad closer as the film's been foreshadowing their relationship since movie number one, and the wizarding world gets more rumors of the return of Voldemort. We get to learn a little more about our characters and see how their skills have developed over the past few years. It gives us an even more nice and interesting ark. \n\nThis film in particular took and interesting and even more exceptional route to its storytelling. I like the way this story was told compared to the first two films. It had some elements that I didn't particularly care for, but I won't speak of as they would be spoilers (basically the finale). However, it strayed from the format that the first two films embraced, but it worked out pretty decently. I thought the screenplay was really well written and I still had a lot of fun with this film. You can see the transition toward a darker story and I can't wait to see more. \n\nIn the end, objectively, this film surpasses the first two films. Subjectively, I honestly had just as much fun with this film as I did with the first two films. That is why even thought it was an exceptionally made film, I'm still going to give it the solid rating I gave the first two films.",

Second, everything feels like a blur and the scene in the book with the cage holding the Monster Book of monsters is a wasted opportunity to sneak in some humor.

Yes this is definitely the most stylish Harry Potter to date, but it also features some great characterisation for our leads (who's cast continue to excel in their roles), and a further exploration of the franchise themes.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: This time the plot itself is actually weaker than in the previous film, and whilst it takes itself on fewer annoying tangents, it fails to draw a suspenseful narrative overall. I found the whole story rather stagnant actually, and even if the source material is partly to blame for that, the filmmakers should realise that straight adaptation isn't always the best way.\nVERDICT: The execution is vastly improved here. It's just a shame the original foundations have less merit overall.",

Malfoy continues to be an utterly pointless irritation, and his comeuppances simply don't justify his presence.

Especially considering how family friendly the first two installments are, but no matter the subtitle, Harry Potter films always maintain that fun atmosphere.\n\nHarry and his buddies have turned 13, his first year of his teens, and this film subtly tackles some common issues that an early teen has.  Not only is Harry dealing with the angst of trying to be independent from his muggle family, but he then is forced with coming to terms with an estranged family member returning to find Harry, Sirius Black.  All the films have relatively the same setting, characters, and tone, but Prisoner of Azkaban is clearly a part of a maturation process for Harry.  There's something to be said for a film that takes its franchise in a totally new direction (i.e. Fast Five), but I also can't help but think this film was missing a few familiar plot points.\n\nAlfonso Cuarón took the reigns from Chris Columbus and he brought a refreshing take on the Potterverse.  Just by simply looking at the advancement of technology in CGI and in the unique camera movements/shots, this was going to be a different Potter film.  Cuarón brought along Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore, after the unfortunate passing of Richard Harris.  As great as Harris is, his calming presence may not have worked as Dumbledore here.  Gambon fits in well as a more demanding and mysterious headmaster than in the previous two films.\n\nWith that said, Voldemort's lack of presence is definitely felt.  I enjoy the late-game twist in the film's villain and I understand we don't necessarily need him every film, but there was barely any mention of him.  Yes, that's the way it is in the book, but for me, it degrades the score a bit.  The focus here is more on Sirius Black and Professor Lupin.  Both of which have unexpected twists and turns that make the third act quite the whirlwind.  To me, this film plays more as a part 1 of 2 to the Goblet of Fire, because we only get a glimpse into Pettigrew and his relation to the dark lord and Harry's parents.  \n\nEither way, Prisoner of Azkaban is a welcomed changeup in the film's franchise and one that, on repeat viewings, only gets better.  I mean, who doesn't love time travel, Hippogriff's, a long awaited punch, a little quality time with Harry & Hermione, and one big twist right?  It's a slower pace and a darker tone, but Prisoner of Azkaban is no slouch of a film.\n\n+ Cuarón's different style\n\n+Gary Oldman enters the picture\n\n+Fantastic visuals/cinematography\n\n+Hermione & Harry team-up\n\n-No Voldemort presence\n\n8.7/10",

            "content": "This is certainly darker than the first two instalments, and not as funny. But based upon a truly excellent but complex book, it is a very good film nonetheless. In my reviews on the first two films, I forgot to mention the music by John Williams. In all three movies, it is very good, but not Williams's best work. His scores to Star Wars, ET and Home Alone are better. The only real quibble i had with the movie was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Richard Harris, the first and better Dumbledore, had died, and although Gambon was good, Harris suited the character a lot more in terms of looks and sincerity. The three leads are still likable, and they are given solid support by Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane. The real treat lies in the newcomers though, namely David Thewlis as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius. Timothy Spall I felt was a little odd for Wormtail. The Dementors I felt quite terrifying, a lot more chilling than they were in the book. All in all, very good. 8/10. Bethany Cox",

The adult actors are still improving, and the new Dumbledore does a much better job of acting as that character than the last. The cinematography is great. The scene in the shrieking shack is a perfect example of intense action on a small scale. Yet, the continuity slips up incredibly. While I much prefer Alfonzo directing, he clearly ignored a lot of the things that had already been set up by Columbus, even if he didn't have to. Changing Dumbledore needed to be done; Flitwicks makeover, the redesign of the castle and the sudden new school rules on wardrobe did not. Add to that this was a terrible adaptation, which left me screaming at the scream on my first sitting, you can understand why I don't think it's perfect.

Cuarón Injects the Harry Potter Franchise with an Amazing New Energy!\n\nOriginally Written June 4, 2004--\nHarry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts starts off badly when he learns deranged killer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison and is bent on murdering the teenage wizard. While Hermione's (Emma Watson) cat torments Ron's (Rupert Grint) sickly rat, causing a rift among the trio, a swarm of nasty Dementors is sent to protect the school from Black. A mysterious new teacher helps Harry learn to defend himself, but what is his secret tie to Sirius Black?\n\nThis is what I have been waiting for! After playing it safe in the last two Harry Potter movies, Warner Bros. finally took some risks and hired Alfonso Cuarón of \"Y Tu Mamá También\" fame to inject this franchise with an amazing new energy! This \"Harry Potter\" adventure is darker, more mature, and much more focused on the characters than previous entries have been! I loved it! \"Prisoner of Azkaban\" is my favorite of the first three J.K. Rowling novels. Now, this film is my favorite of the three as well. Fantastic! Five stars!",

            "content": "The first of the Harry Potter films to actually have a dark undertone, The Prisoner of Azkaban is the third installment in the Harry Potter series. The film is centered on the escape of Sirius Black from Azkaban and how our favorite trio deals with the new threat. The trio of actors are growing up, along with their characters. They can no longer be treated as children, but rather young actors. Of course, as they are young, they aren't perfect, Radcliffe in this film seems a little too nervous and unnatural in many scenes. Emma Watson's most memorable scene is when she punched Draco Malfoy's face. Rupert Grint is very good at playing the helpless and annoying best friend. It is understandable that Grint wouldn't have much to give to the movie as his character is very two dimensional. Radcliffe, on the other hand, does not have that luxury. He definitely feels the pressure of his role, as he has to portray a character so many people love and imagine, but also listen to the directors and advice of the older actors. I feel as though they have improved in their acting from the previous films, though I would definitely say that they still have many areas that they need to work on. They are lucky enough to be able to work with many so many older actors that have many years of experience. These actors would definitely be good teachers to the younger cast.\n The older actors are what really made this film so great. There were more scenes with the older actors and they enhanced this movie. With Richard Harris's death, Michael Gambon stepped in to portray the wise headmaster Albus Dumbledore. He has done a great job portraying Dumbledore not only as a peculiar and mischievous headmaster, but also a man of great wisdom given in riddles. We also get to see a lot more of Snape. Alan Rickman's drawling tone and gloomy atmosphere is remarkably spiteful. David Thewlis plays the role of Remus Lupin, a seemingly harmless and wise teacher with dark secrets. His greatest part in the movie would be helping Harry fight his fears and becoming the first father figure that Harry would encounter and remember in his life.\nWhen something is dark and ominous, the music makes the audience feel uneasy, or when the music whimsical, people can expect some laughs. The main composer of this film is John Williams and I felt that his music improved the movie scenes more so than the past two films. The scene where Harry first flies on the hippogriff is a magnificent piece of music. The beginning starts off with a fierce drum solo and then proceeds with magical string instruments and chimes to create majestic feel. This correlates with the scene as Harry flies around the castle. It makes the castle look spectacular and glorious. Another song that really makes the scene is \"A Window to the Past\". It plays where Harry is talking to Professor Lupin on the bridge. He learns that Lupin was his parents' longtime friend and he learns more about his parents in this scene. This song is initially played by a harp and a flute. It gives off a sentimental feel and it fits with the medieval setting of Hogwarts. \nThe animations of the film are splendid. So much of the film is takes place where supernatural coexists with normalcy, all of which has to be made by CGI. The dementors were beautifully made and served its purpose of giving children nightmares at night. Director Cuaron's wizard world is much more bleak and ominous than Director Columbus's world. Instead of prancing around the castle corridors, much of the movie takes place outside Hogwarts. This movie feels much more dangerous, more enchanted and most importantly, real. The shadowy forests full of magical creatures, the damp meadows, the dark skies, all of this just screams Cuaron. There are a lot more scenes where the viewer is able to take time and fully look at the entirety of Hogwarts. He is a natural at capturing the eerie and mysterious power of the natural world. \nThe first scene that I felt was beautifully made, was the first time the dementors came on board the train. Rupert Grint's acting here was splendid, Emma Watson needed more work on pretending to be in pain. Though she more than made up for it later in the film as a growing lady with snarky comments.  The dementors, the music, the special effects, all were beautifully woven into a scene that would strike fear into many people's hearts.",

The acting is also way better this time around, but that doesn't come as a surprise when you add really experienced actors like David Thewlis and Gary Oldman to the mix, but also the performances of the our three main guys are pretty good.

            "content": "One of the most perplexing and irritating aspects of Hollywood is the way it continues to churn out samey, mediocre fare based purely on the financial success of previous instalments. Having endured the first two Harry Potter films, and seen them gross more than $800m each, we might have expected the series to plod along ad nauseum, with every year or so bringing us another disappointing and inconsequential adventure for the little wizard.\n\nFortunately for all concerned, that didn't happen. With Chris Columbus leaving the director's chair to spend more time with his family, the time was ripe for a fresh pair of eyes to come in and give the franchise the kick up the arse that it badly needed. With The Lord of the Rings trilogy now completed, garnering rave reviews and 11 Oscars, this would be the film that would need to justify going on. While Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban never quite comes close to Peter Jackson's brilliance, it is far superior to anything that came before in the series and set the bar very high for all that came after.\n\nAlfonso Cuarón may now be a name toasted among film fans, following his gripping work on Children of Men and the groundbreaking visuals in Gravity. But he was by no means a shoe-in to direct. Guillermo del Toro said that he wasn't interested because it was too \"bright and happy and full of light\", while Marc Forster turned it down because of his work with child actors on Finding Neverland. In the end it came down to a three-way choice between Cuarón, Thelma and Louise screenwriter Callie Khouri, and Kenneth Branagh, who had appeared as Gilderoy Lockhart in the previous instalment, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nThe box office failure of Love's Labour's Lost probably deprived us of the heady excitement that would have been a Branagh-helmed Potter film. But there can be no doubt that Cuarón was a great choice, for one simple reason: he understands how fantasy storytelling works, particularly how any fantasy film must be underpinned by a sense of wonderment. Columbus' pathological desire to faithfully replicate the books on screen had robbed J. K. Rowling's source material of all its sense of wonder and amazement. Cuarón restores the balance, giving us a darrker plot with more developed characters and never losing sight of the magic in amongst the spells.\n\nPut simply, all the details of the world of Harry Potter, and the story in which he finds himself, are more fully and strikingly realised in Prisoner of Azkaban. Cuarón gets a lot of the big stuff right early on, whether it's the light-hearted comedy of the Knight Bus or the chilling design of the Dementors. But he also puts in a lot of effort to make all the little details fit, particularly during the scenes at The Leaky Cauldron. Whether it's the self-stirring coffee, the angular corridors, the carnivorous books or the silently screaming wanted posters, you always feel that what you are seeing is magic, rather than constantly being told that something is magic.\n\nThis magical feeling is reinforced by the film's colour palette. In my review of The Philosopher's Stone, I likened its visual style to sanitised adaptations of Charles Dickens which are common in America; as a general rule, I argued, British adaptations of Great Expectations, Oliver Twist and the like are more content to leave all the edges on. This film is shot by Michael Seresin, Alan Parker's cinematographer-of-choice who would later team up with Cuarón again on Gravity. Cuarón clearly understands the darker, more distinctly British roots of the series and the genres upon which it draws, and allows Seresin to work his murky magic with piercing blues and encircling blacks, making it look like a horror film for children.\n\nFrom a narrative point of view, Prisoner of Azkaban benefits greatly from the direct absence of Voldemort. On the one hand, the fact that he doesn't appear physically or personally in the story spares the film from becoming too repetitive or formulaic: it isn't simply retreading old ground and prolonging the inevitable. This is the trap into which the later Potter films often fell: we always knew that things would end with a showdown between Harry and Voldemort, and the more the films went on without it happening, the more irritating the tease became.\n\nOn the other hand, the Dark Lord's influence remains a background threat, allowing Cuarón to build a more intimidating atmosphere. In the first two films, Harry was constantly on the lookout for the man himself: we always knew who the bad guy was, even if we didn't know what form he would take. With Voldemort having to prey on Harry indirectly, he is forced to choose his friends more carefully, and learns over the course of the film just how deceptive appearances can be.\n\nBy putting Harry on more insecure footing, the film manages to epitomise his adolescent confusion about the world, and the conflict he faces in fulfilling a role which he didn't choose. The first two films often painted Harry as a goody-two-shoes who had perfect parents, but here we get the first hints of things being a little more nuanced than that. When Harry watches the Dementors kill him and Sirius, expecting his dad to come in and cast the patronus charm, he begins to realise that he cannot rely on their reputation if he is to grow as a wizard. While the next film in the series goes into this in more detail, threatening to tear apart the three central friendships, Prisoner of Azkaban does a good job of setting this up.\n\nThis brings us on naturally to the time travel element of the story. Anyone familiar with Back to the Future Part II, Twelve Monkeys or Timecrimes will instantly recognise the territory we are in, with the characters constantly trying to avoid running into themselves, and events being repeated from different perspectives. Coming as it does towards the end of the film, our natural instinct is to conclude that it's surplus to requirement, one twist too many. But if we allow it to play out and watch as all the pieces fit together, we discover that it ties into the central themes of trust and reputation quite nicely. Besides, if we can accept the existence of horcruxes, sorting hats and hippogriffs, time travel isn't much of a stretch.\n\nDespite all its darkness and intimidation, Prisoner of Azkaban also manages to be pretty funny. The scene where Potter beats up Malfoy and his thugs near the Shrieking Shack is a classic piece of British slapstick, with Tom Felton showing excellent timing through his many pratfalls. The interplay between Snape and Sirius is like a double-act in itself, with Sirius' manic energy coming up against Snape's stonewalling seriousness. Throw in the first scene with the boggart and most of the opening section, and you have a film which achieves a fine balance of light and shade.\n\nWith the young cast continuing to improve and growing into their roles, Prisoner of Azkaban also has a couple of aces up its sleeve in the adult cast. David Thewlis was an ideal choice for Lupin: he revels in his lanky physicality and whistful delivery, in stark contrast to his more tight-laced performance in Gangster No. 1. Gary Oldman's performance is equally remarkable, being much more operatic in scale but still retaining a gentle, tortured humanity. Oldman resists the urge to simply ham it up and play mad, imbuing Sirius with a tormented quality which makes him compelling.\n\nIn spite of all its successes, there are still a couple of problems with Prisoner of Azkaban. Despite the best efforts of Cuarón and screenwriter Steve Kloves, elements of the plot are still repetitive or predictable. After three films, it's fair to presume that whoever holds the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts is going to be a villain in some form, and it is equally certain that Dumbledore will pop up at key moments to misdirect, drop hints or mischievously intervene. These tropes aren't enough to derail the action at any given point, but they are pinches of salt to be taken whenever anyone describes this film as ground-breaking.\n\nAdditionally, the film still feels longer than it should. This was the shortest of the three films at the time, at 142 minutes, and it remained the shortest until Order of the Phoenix three years later. But while the pacing is better than Columbus' offerings, it still feels like there is an awful lot of plot being squeezed in when the sensible thing would be to cut more stuff out. Cuarón keeps the fans at arms' length, deciding what he wants to shoot and leave in, but another couple of swift edits to get it down to two hours wouldn't have hurt.\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a massive improvement on the first two films, justifying the continuation of the series and helping to explain its appeal to those out of the loop. While it's still too long and well-worn in places, it largely makes up for this with strong performances, interesting themes, much better pacing and a visual style that combines horror and fantasy to leave us really impressed. Whether it's the best Harry Potter film remains a matter of debate, but there is no debate that the later films owe their existence to its success.",

I also struggled with the casting of David Thewlis as Lupin, as his appearance and voice is not at all what I imagined when reading the book (that's a me problem, really, and not an issue with the film).  I thought the acting in this film was good; Gary Oldman was spectacular for the 5 minutes he actually got to act.  I was sad that he didn't get a little more development early on in the film, because his crazed portrayal was quite good.  Just another victim of adapting the complex book story to film.  I'm a little thrown by Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore, as it is so drastically different from Richard Harris' portrayal.  It's not bad, just different and takes some adjusting.  Overall, I wish they hadn't clung so tightly to keeping things quite so close to the book and retooled the story to flow and work better as a film.",

Michael Gambon is actually a great replacement, but is not as good though, but I'm not going to give that a negative. For the director's way, it actually made this better than the first and second film. The three leads are getting better like they're growing up in the movie. It's actually the first movie that when I first saw it, I closed my eyes because I was getting really scared of the movie, and that's because it gets more and more dark so far. The effects are amazing and creative. It develops a bit of chemistry between Ron and Hermione which I'm glad they put it in, even if it's short. The story is great and never seem to be similar to the previous films. he cast is great as usual, but what was actually one of the highlights, is Gary Oldman who is just fantastic in this, even if he was barely in it. David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, and Timothy Spall are also really good in it that made it memorable. I was starting to think that if there's questions that weren't answered in the movie, then you have to read the book to find out, which at first I was thinking that's a bad thing, but consider that it's based on a book, I'll let it slide. It's more exciting and still has lots of funny moments. It has more emotional depth than the previous films, and it's the best Harry Potter film so far.",

Even changing directors (from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuaron) can't stop this juggernaut of excellent films.\n\nOnce again, Steve Kloves' script keeps very close to the book. While the director added in new elements, both good (clock motif) and questionable (overly exaggerated Ron-Hermione shipping), the film still feels very much like the first two, albeit with a darker tone (which the book also creates, so good job on that).\n\nI am now enjoying the child actors more, as they have both literally and figuratively grown into their roles. Daniel Radcliffe really shows Harry on the cusp of adolescence, with emotions beginning to run high and a desperate need to fit in. Rupert Grint is at his best in this film, playing both bumbling fool, and loyal team member. Emma Watson really hit her stride here, and the future is nothing but bright for her.\n\nWe also have some new additions. Michael Gambon had a tremendously difficult job replacing the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore, but I was pleased to see that he did not try to copy his predecessor, but rather forge a new path. David Thewlis is a little leering as Lupin, but it matches with his character, so I enjoy it. Gary Oldman is genuinely scary in his big reveal as Sirius Black, but when the character changes towards the film's end, he really sells it.\n\nThis is also John Williams' last time writing the score, and he really brings it home. \"Double Trouble\" creates the perfect tone for the film, and \"Buckbeak's Flight\" is used well at the beginning and end. Sirius' theme was woven in so subtly, I didn't even notice it until this time watching the movie, and I have owned the soundtrack for five years. Bravo, John Williams, bravo.\n\nConsidered by many to be one of the best in the franchise, I have to say that the tone, acting, and structure of the whole film is very well-done. Some big changes are coming to the series, and this is the last film of the original mold.",

Cuaron, though, is to be commended for his distinct visual flair he brings to the picture, and his pacing that, though occasionally slipping into frenzy, is far actively engaging than Columbus's. Armed with great actors and great source material, Cuaron also casts the entire story under the shadow of death, that looms elusively over all. This menace clearly establishes a shift to come in the narrative, and Cuaron balances whimsy and darkness with remarkable finesse, doing a fine job with a nice twist towards the end and a continuing development of characters.

After running away from his uncles house, he goes to London where he spends the rest of the vacation at the Leaky Cauldron. There he meets his best friends Ron Weasley (Grint) and Hermione Granger (Watson). Together they get on the Hogwarts Express, where they share a compartment with a sleeping professor.

As the creature comes toward Harry, the new Defense against the Black Arts teacher Remus Lupin (Thewlis) wakes up and saves the day. \n\nAt Hogwarts, Harry and his friends learn that Dementors will be guarding the School because a dangerous man, called Sirius Black (Oldman), has escaped from Azkaban. As the year progresses and the students attend new classes such as Care of Magical Creatures given by Rubeus Hagrid (Coltrane) and Divination given by the crazy Sybill Trelawney (Thompson), the trio unravels that there is a connection between Sirius Black and Harry...",

TPOA is the worst storyline out of the franchise and Cuaron tries so hard make it better. \n\nThough the best part about it is the amazing and fantastic directing. How he splices different shots together and the creepy color to the film is rewarding. This is the weakest so far out of the franchise, but it's not a bad movie. It's just not on the level of harry potter. Overall it's good in the beginning and is rushed too much sat the end. 7.8",

Chris Columbus' films seemed like soundstage set-pieces- but this feels like a living, breathing environment. This is the closest thing to Terry Gilliam directing a Potter film... can you only imagine how great that would've been? \n\nOnly two scenes break the flow of the film in my opinion- the Knight Bus ride (which is the most a-hyuck goofy sequence) and the whomping willow scene. But between Dementors, boggarts, animaguses and a brutal werewolf transformation, you've got what a Harry Potter film should be- full of teen angst and emotion.

New recruits Oldman and Thewlis are fantastic together, and Gambon's turn as Dumbledore (after Richard Harris' regrettably short run) breathes new life into the character, and it's remarkable.\n\nLooking great and sounding great was accomplished by Columbus.

This is a step up not only from the first two in the franchise, but when looking at the series as a whole, this stands as one of the very best. Technically it's beautiful, directed with an air of class and looks sinister yet underneath holds a loving and philosophical tone.\n\nThis is the kind of movie that many film series just never have, one that stands out and is remembered at times as one with a slightly quirky edge to it. The whole story centres around the escape of convict Sirius Black and basically how frightened all the wizards are because of it, but that's not all this is about. Not including the Quidditch and of course magical lessons, this also contains a kind of heartbreaking story that connects with the main plot to make this an emotional ride, and one that may at times have some reaching for the tissues.\n\nRadcliffe and co return better than before, now they aren't quite top quality yet but there are signs here of what is truly to come in future careers. The addition of David Thewlis makes the teaching staff look even better at acting, Alan Rickman as the ever miserable Snape has still got it and cast members such as Robbie Coltrane(Hagrid) make's a much more emotional display. The producers(among them Christopher Columbus who directed the first two) create a cast that is imaginative yet also strangely dark, creating a lovely fresh new look for the movie's.\n\nThis film cannot be reviewed without mentioning the absolutely magnificent technical achievements coursing though this piece. The cinematography is just amazingly fine, in fact watching this for the camera shots, it is beautiful and the fun ways in which it works makes it stand out to us the viewer too, all credit to Michael Seresin. The sets are well made too, dark yes but it makes this look all together much different from the first two movies, less for the children and more for the growing teenager.\n\nAlfonso Cuaron is the real mastermind behind this movie, directing it in a way I don't think anyone could have imagined. He makes it as previously mentioned quirky, and he lets the more serious scenes run their course, letting the comedy also have it's time in the limelight. Cuaron makes this just generally new looking, you'd struggle to find a fantasy film so serious yet so as if it were made to be overly crazy.\n\nIs it unique, well yes, is it smart well yes I suppose it is but the main point is emotion, now without ruining the ending it could be said emotions run high(without me saying if they're happy or sad). Harry deals with a lot in the movie, and this Harry Potter as well who lets face it, deals with an over abundance of crazy hijinks on a seemingly daily basis, or maybe that could a yearly basis actually. \n\nSo overall a new take on a fantasy series that always brings something new to the frontier of movie making, it's a very good piece and one I am sure that will live on in the minds of movie fans and of course Potter fans, for many many years.",
