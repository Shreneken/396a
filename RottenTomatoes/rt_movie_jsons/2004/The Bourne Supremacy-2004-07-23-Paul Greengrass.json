    "summary": "Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is living in India when he is framed by Russian agent Kirill (Karl Urban) for the theft of millions from the CIA. Kirill begins to pursue Bourne, intending to assassinate him -- but while Bourne and his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente), are on the run, a shot meant for him kills her instead. Vowing revenge, Bourne sets out to prove his innocence and bring the culprits to justice, but he has to evade CIA head Pamela Landry (Joan Allen), who is convinced he is guilty.",

Each of them is distinguished by its own character, which does not allow you to get confused where this or that scene comes from. The atmosphere of the city is well conveyed, everything is actually so gloomy, gray. The final chase around Moscow is great. True, crazy races around the city, with the participation of two professional killers, are rarely seen in reality...\n\nAs a result, we get an interesting, dynamic action movie, with elements of a thriller and drama, after which you will definitely be satisfied.",

The cat and mouse relationship between Bourne and Landy helped to make up for the sometimes lacking sequences though.

            "content": "A rush of adrenaline to rattle your senses.\n\nPaul Greengrass' espionage thriller The Bourne Supremacy (2004) is a visceral movie and an experimental film from a master of the indie film world. Greengrass crafts a complex tale from Robert Ludlum with care and relentless focus. Tony Gilroy's script questions how we cope with loss in the face of adversity. Whether zooming in gently during a close-up or speeding down European highways, Greengrass' direction is an intimate touch of chaotic energy. He approaches shooting films like tapping deep into the unconscious desires of his audiences for shocking twists, enthralling chases, brutal hand to hand combat, and clever conversations. Normally I would loathe shaky camera choices, but Greengrass combines it with focused intent as you always know what is happening. Your mind follows all the images with just enough understanding to feel every blow.\n\nOliver Wood's cinematography is beautiful during the speaking, but like a shotgun blast during the action. Together Greengrass and Wood shove a gun barrel against the viewer's head with excitement guaranteed. What an awesome and creative sequel to a classic of the espionage thriller genre. Paul Greengrass not only did justice to Doug Liman's iconic direction for The Bourne Identity, but Greengrass may have surpassed Liman's workhorse approach with his arthouse sensibilities for The Bourne Supremacy.\n\nMoby's \"Extreme Ways\" theme song for The Bourne Trilogy is still stuck in my head with his distinct electronic layering and melancholic singing over one of cinema's coolest main themes. His music fits the lonely vibe of The Bourne Trilogy aptly as Moby leaves the audience feeling changed by the end of these movies. John Powell's score itself is excellent in its own right. He captures the tense feeling of compounding pressure with inner mental conflicts and the suspense of being hunted. I appreciate the insane editing of rapid fire cuts and striking image matching for The Bourne Supremacy from editors Richard Pearson and Christopher Rouse. They make The Bourne Supremacy's 108 minutes feel like 30.\n\nMatt Damon is poignant in The Bourne Supremacy as a man facing grief with intense loneliness and subdued reflection. His action work as Jason Bourne is still peak Damon with killer combat and unforgettable intensity. Damon's choreography is as impressive as his dramatic acting in The Bourne Supremacy. Franka Potente gets a nice cameo as Bourne's girlfriend Marie is sweet and heartbreaking. I have to hand it to Greengrass for the brave decision to kill off such a beloved character. Michelle Monaghan has a cool cameo as Pam's technical assistant Kim. Julia Stiles gets a wonderful little supporting performance as Nicky Parsons. Her tears during the meeting with Bourne feel real. I wish she got better roles after the Bourne films.\n\nJoan Allen plays Pamela Landy as shrewd and in control, yet hopelessly outclassed. It's an interesting performance, especially as a foe for Bourne. Brian Cox steals every scene he's in as the man beyond the shadows Ward Abbott. His calculating manipulation of all events is fascinating as is Cox' nuanced performance of cold decision making. I do like Karl Urban's Russian secret service assassin Kirill. His harsh interactions with everyone and sudden resorting to violence make his character genuinely threatening to the near untouchable Jason Bourne.\n\nOverall, The Bourne Supremacy is every bit as good as The Bourne Identity. This time the action is more in your face as you are held in suspense by Paul Greengrass until he lets go only once the credits roll.",

The director decided to take a new approach, hence a new story arc. \nI also thought this movie had less suspense then the first. The first movie gripped me because we have to find out Jason Bourne's identity, and slowly realize that he has had special training in things he should not know. Doug Liman creates his movie in a certain way so that the spectators can piece the puzzle together. It was a little mysterious, I guess. This movie fails on that note, too. He wants to find his wife's killer, even though we all know it was ordered by a high-ranking person in the CIA. I didn't get the same suspenseful sensation as before because I knew who Jason Bourne was working with.\nBut, to end this review on a positive tone, I want to praise the director's editing. Paul Greengrass is the only person out there who knows how to use quick-cut editing to make his action scenes more brutal, realistic and fast-paced, so I was pleased with that. Matt Damon once again gives 200% in his role, and I thought that Joan Allen was superbe in this movie. \nSo, although I was a little disappointed, THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is still an above-average action/revenge thriller.",

            "content": "'THE BOURNE SUPREMACY' was directed by Paul Greengrass and stars Matt Damon, Joan Allen and Brian Cox. ?Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is living in India when he is framed by Russian agent Kirill (Karl Urban) for the theft of millions from the CIA. Kirill begins to pursue Bourne, intending to assassinate him -- but while Bourne and his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente), are on the run, a shot meant for him kills her instead. Vowing revenge, Bourne sets out to prove his innocence and bring the culprits to justice, but he has to evade CIA head Pamela Landry (Joan Allen), who is convinced he is guilty.\n\nI actively dislike 'The Bourne Identity'. I was very disappointed by it and don't understand the love for it. Thus, I put off seeing this movie for quite some time. I regret doing so. 'The Bourne Supremacy' trumps its predecessor in pretty much every conceivable way. Franka Potente's character, Marie Kreutz, from the first was probably my least favourite part of the movie and she's gone! I imagine this upset many people but I personally was delirious with it and love the arc change it gives to Bourne. Enough comparisons, let's get into what makes this movie great.\n\nThe story. I really like the story for this movie but I don't know why. It shouldn't work for me but there is some mystery and government conspiracy that entices me to like it. I know that this is basically a good way to describe the plot of Identity but it felt so much more refined in this one than it did with Identity. I do have issues with the way the film ends, however. It feels kinda anti-climactic and the final scene is very weak, without context from Ultimatum. I wont spoil the ending but I just wasn't very satisfied by it.\n\nDamon was good in Identity and I will say he was probably the best part of the film. We see his transformation into Bourne at the end and that is fully explored in this movie, and that benefits Damon immensely. It enables him to give a brilliant performance that delves deep into Bourne's mind and portrays a unique blend of pure, unfiltered emotion and pure, unfiltered awesomeness. Opposing Bourne is my least favourite aspect of this film. The villain is very weak overall and I was not impressed or entertained by them in the slightest. Karl Urban's Kiril was pretty cool and provided a physical opposition to Bourne but had too little backstory and motivation to make me really feel invested in his character or care. I get he is a contract killer and that is fine but I would have liked more explanation to his character and background.\n\nJoan Allen was very good as Pamela Landy and was a very welcome addition to the cast. Brian Cox was great as Ward Abbot but I would have liked a little more from him in the long run character wise. The other, more minor supporting cast, all did fine jobs and none of them actively irked me, performance wise.\n\nAside from ONE poorly done action scene in this movie, the movie was well shot, directed and edited together. Greengrass remains the only living director capable of using hand-held cam effectively and, while he perfects the craft later on, utilises the unpopular technique effectively here. There are next to no special effects in this movie which is both phenomenal and admirable for an action film in this day and age and I cannot thank the crew enough for that.\n\nThis is more minor but I love the score for these movies. It's awesome and amazing and badass and has earned my love. I rarely comment on a film's score unless I like it a lot so good job to the composers.\n\nIn conclusion, I really liked The Bourne Supremacy. If, like me, you didn't like Identity, I still urge you to give this one a shot. It's got great acting, good action, an interesting story, and while the villain does drag it down a peg or two, it is still a thrilling ride from beginning to end. I'll rate this movie a solid 7 Stalking Bournes out of 10 and definitely recommend you see this great movie.",

This second instalment in the Bourne series basically is where Jason Bourne's (Matt Damon) revenge comes in, and where the action plot takes over, whereas the first movie was basically an establishment of the characters, and just progressing the story to have a lead up to \"The Bourne Supremacy\". This movie uses that build up, and absolutely runs with it. The amount of intensity that this movie brings is amazing, from the car chases, to the phone calls that Bourne makes to Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), to all the fight scenes in between, \"The Bourne Supremacy\" has all the pieces to be a classic action movie. Matt Damon fills the role stunningly - Jason Bourne is just SUCH a badass in this movie. Every line he delivers seems like it was edited for weeks by writers before it was put into the script - his character is that good in this movie. The only issue that I have with this movie, however, is the multi-dimensional plot that it brings in. If you miss a scene or two, this movie suddenly gets extremely confusing, as every part of this movie showcases an eventful part of the plot, which gets kind of overwhelming. But, once you get past the plot and just let the beauty of the movie's thrill, excitement, and sheer intensity, \"The Bourne Supremacy\" is definitely worth the watch.",

However, one thing I didn't really enjoy was the overuse of shaky camera.

Yes, this is properly engaging spy stuff that keeps you engaged because the normally meaningless corporate bosses are real, interesting characters with interesting agendas and stories of their own.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: These new elements do slightly compromise the focus on Bourne himself. Unfortunately, his arc is far less interesting here, and he serves little more than a big piece in an arguably more exciting game.\nVERDICT: 'Bourne Supremacy' pokes its finger further into the espionage pie and massively succeeds - shame it forgets a little about its main ingredient along the way.",

It's far from risky or overly original, but The Bourne Supremacy is as tightly compacted and impeccably directed as a spy thriller can get.\n\nStepping in for Doug Liman is Paul Greengrass, known now as a master of suspense films, and Supremacy was one of his first gems.  As I've said before, the original Bourne trilogy gets better with each film, and I think this second entry in the spy series may give us the best performance from Matt Damon in the title role.  With his increasingly likable performance and magnetic charm, along with Tony Gilroy's well strung script, Supremacy tends to hit on all levels.\n\nWith a bigger budget and seemingly more freedom in that department, I feel like the filmmakers wanted to turn the series in a slightly more action heavy route.  Instead of Bourne being on the run from the C.I.A., this time he's hunting them, and the action steps up because of that.  Bourne has more time to plan out his moves and hence the scenes feeling more natural and polished.  With that said, the reason the action works so well, is because the characters are written with depth and motivations.  There are no mustache twirling villains, you understand where everyone is coming from, even if you don't agree with their decisions.\n\nOne of those nicely written characters is Joan Allen's Pamela Landy.  Landy, a new task force leader from the C.I.A., wants just as many answers as Bourne as she draws close to the truth behind Treadstone.  Unfortunately for her, Bourne is after everyone who ever wronged him, and Landy may be one of them.  Much like the first film, as the audience you suspect what's going on, but it's far more interesting to watch the performances and reactions of the characters finding out themselves.  That's a tribute to the acting and directing.\n\nAt the center of each Bourne film is the performance of the great Matt Damon, and I don't know that he's ever been as good as he is in 'Supremacy'.  The wide range of emotion and flawless action sequences that he (reportedly) did stunts for is impressive.  The best Bourne is revenge Bourne and that's what we get here.  It's always entertaining to watch him rip apart the C.I.A.'s attempts to take him down, even on the 5th or 6th viewing.\n\n+Damon has never been better\n\n+Joan Allen\n\n+Amped up action, amped up characters\n\n+Vulnerable but vengeful Bourne\n\n9.4/10",

            "content": "After revisiting the one that started it all; 'The Bourne Identity', here we are with the second film in the Bourne Trilogy titled 'The Bourne Supremacy'. Firstly, it is very very common for action sequels to completely fall flat compared to their predecessor, they try to replicate what the first film does well but also include enough new elements to put itself one step above in terms of quality. Now although this isn't a bad approach, finding a good balance between the old and the new aint easy and getting it wrong has killed many action franchises. Thankfully, this film tries to find that balance and does so successfully... You have all the elements and the formula introduced to us in the first film present, and also some newer story elements bought in to make this film feel like a fresh experience. Much of the success of this sequel and the franchise as a whole can be attributed to the bringing in of director Paul Greengrass, whose ability to direct action and suspense shines through immensely in this sequel. \n\nTo me this film felt like a slightly more refined and well crafted version of what Doug Liman did in The Bourne Identity. The action here was shot in a way that made it seem a lot more intense and the feeling of suspense and not quite knowing what was going to happen was greater. One of these can be seen as something Liman could have maybe done a little better, and the other is something that could only be done due to where Jason Bourne's character is at the time of this film's setting. The way Greengrass films the action in this film whether it be hand to hand combat or the car chases sucks you into the scene more that the scenes in the first film did. In 'Identity' the scenes were almost just as brutal and exciting as in this film but you did feel like you were still observing the scene, whereas in this film it is like you are there in the room feeling every punch and every hit and it all just adds to the overall experience. \n\nAs well as the action, i mentioned that the level of suspense and mystery surrounding the events of every major scene is elevated in this film, to a level you could not get to in 'Identity'. This is due to the fact that in this film it is safe to say that Jason Bourne is much smarter than before, he is remembering a lot more and therefore he goes into every scenario always knowing more than both the government and you. It makes for a lot and i mean a lot of exciting scenes that never go exactly how you thought they may go. The pacing in this film is also a lot more upbeat than before, it never slows down and is always moving from place to place, action set-piece to action set-piece giving you very small windows of time where you can relax. And you thought turning a pen into a weapon was impressive?? That's easy, it has a sharp point, not too much different from a knife..... try going up against a knife-wielding enemy with a fucking magazine... unless you're Jason Bourne, you're not walking away from that fight alive. \n\nPerformance wise, this film is almost just as strong as the first film although it maybe does lack a compelling character to replace Chris Cooper's character in the first film. Joan Allen's 'Pamela Landy' was a character serviceable as being the one in the way of Jason Bourne's chance of freedom, but the reasoning for her involvement in the film was pretty unclear and it did feel like they bought her in because they needed a new evil government official. Karl Urban could have had a little more of a prominent presence in the film as he made little to no impact on the film outside of the entertaining action scenes. Again the franchise tiptoes around Julia Stiles' character who is one of the more interesting ones of the franchise, pushing her to the side once again. I really do hope we see more of her in 'Ultimatum'......\n\nSo that's all for the second instalment in the fantastic Bourne Trilogy, overall it builds upon the elements that made the first film very enjoyable and introduces some more exciting set-pieces with higher stakes not possible with the mindset of Bourne's character in the first film. The action is exciting, the suspense is higher and once again the film ends in a way that isolates itself from any sequels, whilst still leaving room to explore this world further. \n\n8.2/10",

The ending of the film seems odd; perhaps I missed something (it is a very visual film, and I am not a visual learner).\n\nThere is a startling lack of humour as well. Not even quippy one-liners.

Suddenly a tragic thing happened in Berlin as her agents were killed and Jason Bourne was the suspect as it is obviously a setup from the Threadstone. We know that Bourne was a trained soldier specified by Threadstone and now Bourne wants to recover from it and move on as he wants to redeem something in return. Awesome story as it was like the prequel. I was into it, and story wise it is engaging. Matt Damon deserves every credit as Jason Bourne. He is so awesome in this film, thinking Bourne is a living professional killer. And has a lot of killer instinct as the character progresses. Fast paced and bone crunching action skills, with awesome shaky cam, as well as Bourne's spy skills. Awesome action overall and can't wait to review the last part of the trilogy. 4 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "I don't have a whole lot to say about this film. Where Identity surprised me because it was better than I remembered, Supremacy lived down to my memories of it. Where the plot in Identity was strong, there is very little logical plot in Supremacy. Where the fights and chases in Identity made sense, in Supremacy they shake the camera like a 3-year-old after downing a Red Bull. So in the end, I got very little enjoyment out of this movie. I'll reiterate my opinion from my Identity review and say that I think Matt Damon is horrendous as an action star and I continued to hate his performance in this movie. In fact I didn't really find anyone who I really liked in the cast, with the possible exception of Julia Stiles (but she only gets a couple small scenes to work with.) Karl Urban could have been good, but he had almost no lines and basically just had to look like a killer for most of the movie. Of course, I'd be lying if I said I didn't like anything in the movie, there were moments I enjoyed quite a bit. It was particularly nice when it felt like Bourne was 5 steps ahead of everyone else, but that kind of stuff was very limited in this film. He felt out of control for most of the movie, and was just playing catch-up.\n\nI think what made me the most angry with The Bourne Supremacy, and what made all those other flaws stand out more, is the entire \"Chaos Cinema\" technique. Those rapid cuts combined with the extremely shaky handheld camera make it utterly impossible for me to get mentally oriented in the action. Therefore, instead of just going with it and trying to connect the dots to understand the scene, my mind just shuts down and I almost need to close my eyes to avoid nausea. It happens both in the fight scenes and the chases. There's one car chase in the movie where I literally lost track of which car Bourne was driving because they kept cutting so fast. I'm not sure what the logic is behind this type of film-making, but if Paul Greengrass or Oliver Wood are responsible for the way action scenes are filmed nowadays because of this film, then I'd like to punch them in the gut. Perhaps it is a technique to make you feel like you are in the middle of the action, but I don't shake that much even when I'm running full speed so I don't know why the camera would do that. Maybe it's intended to artificially intensify the action, but I actually find it less intense because I can't tell what is going on. As a result I just kept getting frustrated with this movie, and therefore I'd recommend people skip it. It is not interesting or engaging, it is merely annoying.",

Bourne is framed by the Russian Security Service when a CIA sting in Berlin turns murderously wrong. The Russians then hunt down Bourne and kill his wife Marie, introduced to us in the first book/movie.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a fast-paced, vigorous plot that has Bourne constantly moving forward, as he is chased through Naples, Munich, Berlin and Moscow. His deliberate activity is evident in every aspect of his planning and follow-through, as his determination to discover why he is being pursued and who framed him.\r\n\r\nThe movie largely finds its success where the book struggles. Whereas the novel was drawn out at times, there are no extended periods of languor in the film; it moves at a breakneck speed that takes its anticipative viewers toward an explosive, thrilling finale.",

            "content": "\"They came for me and they killed her.\" This quote sums up Jason Bourne's motive for The Bourne Supremacy. This movie keeps the viewer engaged right from the start. Jason Bourne is constantly figuring out his next move, eluding police officers, or in pursuit of collecting intelligence on the people who are after him. Between plot twists, chase scenes, and careful thinking, The Bourne Supremacy keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and keeps them always wondering what might come next. The Bourne Supremacy brings action and adventure back into the genre of action/adventure movies. \nJason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a former CIA assassin who is suffering from amnesia. His last mission didn't go according to plan, and after successfully eluding the CIA in The Bourne Identity, the prequel, Bourne is trying to figure out why the CIA is still after him. He is not aware he was framed for killing two people, agents of Pamela Landy, and stealing important documents in The Bourne Supremacy. After having a run-in with an assassin in India in the beginning of The Bourne Supremacy, Bourne feels it is necessary to put an end to everybody chasing him. \nMatt Damon plays his role masterfully by being extremely violent in some action scenes and also by showing he is human. This is relevant when he sits down with the Neski's daughter at the end of The Bourne Supremacy. However, there is a slight change in his character from the prequel. Bourne was almost exclusively trying to figure out who he was and what his past consisted of in The Bourne Identity, and in the sequel, he just wants to know why the CIA is after him. Bourne, knowing his motive, plays a gloomier, more mysterious role. Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) is flawless in her performance. She doesn't care what anyone else thinks or says about some situations. She is a little oblivious to Bourne's past but will do whatever it takes to find him. Landy's relentlessness to capture Bourne leads to many suspenseful moments. \nThe action scenes, whether it is a car chase or hand-to-hand combat, are really well put together. Some viewers might get fed up with the shaking and erratic camera, but I think it adds to the overall drama and intensity of the scene. The two major highlights are the opening chase scene, and Bourne's run-in with the only remaining Treadstone agent.\nAt points in this movie, the audience could forget why Bourne is doing what he is doing or even why he is doing it. They have to accept that sometimes the characters make decisions based on no reasons at all. Almost all decisions can be figured out, but a few can be unclear. There are many scenes with Bourne driving a car or riding the train. Constantly seeing scenes like this can get boring, but it's made up by the incredible action scenes.    \n\tThe Bourne Supremacy has action, great acting, and a well-thought out plot if followed closely. Damon is truly at his best and the supporting cast is just as good. It draws the viewer in right from the start and always keeps him or her wondering what might happen next. This movie is definitely worth the viewer's time, but will Bourne's luck continue? This is addressed in the next movie, The Bourne Ultimatum.",

Matt Damon is very cool as an action hero but he is flawed and made human in many parts. It is a tense, exciting, and truly engrossing sequel. It is so much better than the original, which is rare for a sequel. It's a fantastic continuation of the story and I love every second of this movies.

            "content": "The Bourne movies are just sensational, the wrong chases, the killings, the fights, the car chasings, the acting, everything is fantastic. The Bourne Supremacy was great sequel of the fantastic Bourne Idenity, I think it was so good as the first, it has the same fantastic qualities. Sow, you have to watch this movie, cause this movie is just excellent, you just can't bored even for a second, this movie is a great thriller and I just love everything about it, The Bourne Supremacy it's just excellent and it's one of the best sequels ever made and one of my favorite sequels ever made. Watch it if you haven't, it has got everything you want in a great movie, trust me, it's really amazing. Great movie.\n\nPaul Greengrass directs this movie very well, he didn't direct the first movie but he still could direct a sequel of the same level of greatness, I think he was a pioneer in this sorts of things. Matt Damon takes the lead role and he just shows me again that The Bourne Movies wouldn't be what they are without the master Damon, he was truly amazing one more time, I just loved his character and his perfomance was great as well, defenitly one of his five best roles ever, and by the way, he wasn't just fantastic at his role, he must have trained a bit to reach the practice of action in this movie, if he had a stunt, whathever, but if he didn't, congrats Matt, you're not just an incredible actor, Matt is known from The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Ultimatum, Good Will Hunting, The Adjustment Bureau, True Grit, The Departed and some other movies. Sow, the rest of the cast is okay, it's average, there's some good actors in it and some okay perfomances, but I rephuse to talk about them, Matt is really the one who stands out, so if somebody asks me what I think about the cast, I'll say that I loved it because of Matt's incredible perfomance. I just don't think that the cast is 100% good because I think that this movie could have a few more stars in it than just Matt. Great cast (8.5/10).\n\nWhen Jason Bourne is framed from a botched CIA operation he is forced to take up his former life as a trained assassin to survive.(What I thought about the plot) I thought the plot was great, it's those types of story with police and agents trying to catch one smart man who will do anything to get away from them, or by these words, it's those types of Bourne stories. Sow, I really liked the plot, it starts off interesting and it ends still being interesting, it worked really well here and I don't think it was a giant copy of the first movie's script, yes it had one or two similliar things, but it's fresh in a way. Great plot (7.9/10).\n\nSoundtrack, well, the soundtrack was amazing, instead of just doing a movie that I like, they also did it with things that I liked in it, this movie had the kind of soundtrack that I like and I loved to hear it while I was watching the movie, the soundtrack is really good, it's not memorable like some Hanz Zimmer's scores, but it's really good and it's worth hearing it. Great soundtrack (7.6/10). The action was fantastic, there was probably a bit more of car chases then just simple action, but yes, the action was great, I loved the excellent and not ufortunately kind of long, it was entertaining to watch and if the actors didn't had stunts for most of their scenes, I can say that they were well trained. Great action scenes (7.8/10).\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, everyone knows that sequels usually never work that well and usually nobody knows for what reason but you can bet that Paul Greengrass might know, because he directed one of the best sequels ever, don't back down on watching this movie just because it's a sequel, never judge a book from it's cover, or in this case, never judge a movie by being a sequel, you really have to watch it if yuo haven't. The Boune Movies are my favorite espionage movies, they're full of thriller, action and much other great things and the movies are also interesting cause they let a thing at the end that leaves you already excited to watch the next one, it's kind of a legacy, but now I'll be completely out of context, I don't think that The Bourne Ultimatum will let the \"Bourne Legacy\" in the upcoming movie called The Bourne Legacy with no Jason Bourne and no Matt, but let's see. Overall, you should watch this amazing sequel of an amazing movie, it will always be apart of my favorite movies and it surprasses so much movies that I can't even say, this is really almots a masterpiece, the movie has a great cast, a great plot, a great soundtrack, great action scenes and it's very entertaining, I totally recommend you to watch it if you haven't and if you did, you know what I'm talking about. I loved the first and I loved the second.- Well that's not usual to say, oh, I'm sorry, I'm talking about The Bourne Supremacy. It's really a fantastic movie, I loved it. The Bourne Supremacy (8.0/10). Great.\n\nGreat movie. Very recommended movie. Grade: B.",

Bourne is forced out of hiding when he is framed for the murder of two agents in Berlin, and embarks on a trail that will uncover the real killer.  Firstly the action centres on Berlin, before moving to Moscow.  Bourne uses all his tricks to stay one step ahead of his pursuers as he slowly draws all the threads together.  Pam Landy (Joan Allen), initially believing Bourne guilty of the murders, leads the team in pursuit.  The finale, in Moscow, concludes with a cracking car chase through the winter streets.  The plot was good, and there was plenty to keep the viewer interested, and, as in the first film, the European backdrop gave the film added appeal.  These are good films, and Matt Damon plays the role really well.",
