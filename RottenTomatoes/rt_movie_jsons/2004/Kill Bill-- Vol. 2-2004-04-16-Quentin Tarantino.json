    "summary": "The Bride (Uma Thurman) picks up where she left off in volume one with her quest to finish the hit list she has composed of all of the people who have wronged her, including ex-boyfriend Bill (David Carradine), who tried to have her killed four years ago during her wedding to another man. Leaving several dead in her wake, she eventually tracks down Bill in Mexico. Using skills she has learned during her assassin career, she attempts to finish what she set out to do in the first place.",

            "content": "this film had every potential to match up to the heights of the first film. and in some ways, this sequel does go leaps and bounds ahead of the first film, but just when the film is about to cross that line of being better than the first one, it gets drawn back by that self-indulgent storytelling that happens in the last act of the film.\n\nnot going to lie, the film does actually have a pretty satisfying conclusion to the story which tarantino introduced us to in the first film. there are some new characters, some amazing fight scenes, great music and ofcourse, the elephant in the room, Bill (finally making an appearance after almost zero screen-time in the first film). but, where this film falters is, in making that personal connection with me which the first one so masterfully did.\n\nthe film shocks you in the first act itself when the bride has a fight (more of a beatdown, really) with Bill's brother Budd. I did not expect things to go down the way they did, I was genuinely in awe and grabbing my head trying to figure out what she'll do next. after that massive shock, the film transitions to something weirdly placed but totally important scenes for the whole film really. after that, the film peaks in it's second act when the bride finally has a showdown with elle driver and that was fight scene which left me with goosebumps whose climax was already foreshadowed in the first film (genius tarantino). the third act is where things get way too self-indulgent and things start to seem that they're happening just for the sake of happening and isn't natural (which was the case up until now). this really bogged down the final taste I have for the film a lot and was not expecting to see such an end to what seemed like a battle of the gods.\n\nnow, by no means is this film bad. some people may like the ending and that's completely fine. the reason I personally don't have a liking towards it (I don't hate it tho) is because it was just too simple and I was expecting something more creative from a director like tarantino. you can still enjoy the film if you're not thinking too much and if you're not an over-analyzer like me. so, I'd still recommend this to you.",

You can't watch the first one without the second and vice versa although the two movies share only the characters and the story.",

            "content": "Kill Bill finishes off The Bride's vengeance with a slow burn drama.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino's neo-Western, martial arts, revenge thriller Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) is something else. Tarantino combines his love of old 70's martial arts pictures and 60's Spaghetti Westerns into a contemplative drama and fierce action revenge thriller. Tarantino's deliberately slow burn pace lets us get to know each character before they die, so that the drama hits harder. I found his crazy style always helps his films feel unique despite how many homages he makes to his favorite classics. Tarantino's writing delivers heartfelt drama and quirky humor with a biting edge. I loved that The Bride gets a happy ending and her daughter back with a touching finale.\n\nEditor Sally Menke's sharp cuts keeps the action moving and then calms down for fewer cuts within conversations for gripping drama. Cinematographer Robert Richardson shoots Kill Bill: Vol. 2 with a sleek framing of close-ups on Uma Thurman or her katana. I like the hectic panning during a swordfight compared to his lovely long held medium shots for the talking. Kill Bill is simply magnificently shot.\n\nUma Thurman is fierce with her determined face and furious eyes as The Bride. Her martial arts, swordplay, and crawling through dirt are impressive. I found Thurman's dramatic speeches about why she left Bill to be particularly compelling. Uma Thurman was born to play The Bride. David Carradine's charisma chams you as the vile villain Bill. His toxic desire to own The Bride is loathsome. Carradine looked like he had a blast delivering long monologue after monologue as Bill. His final moments are beautifully acted.\n\nMichael Madsen is excellent as the sleazy redneck assassin, now a strip club bouncer, named Budd. Madsen feels guilty and selfish as Budd with a fun smirking villain for Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Daryl Hannah sizzles as the sadistic Elle Driver. Her hateful glares and fearsome fighting with Uma Thurman's Bride are iconic. She feels like an Old Hollywood femme fatale.\n\nGordon Liu is amazing and hilarious as a kung fu grandmaster Pai Mei. His hysterical hermit is full of vigor and disdain. I loved seeing Liu's precise movements and fun make-up that dresses him up to look like Lo Lieh. Michael Parks' sexist pimp Esteban Viahio is fascinating with his surly line delivery. Samuel L. Jackson has a cool cameo as The Bride's wedding organist Rufus. Larry Bishop is very funny as Budd's strip club owner boss Larry Gomez. Sid Haig also cameos as the bartender! Perla Haney-Jardine is very cute and sweet as The Bride's daughter B.B. Helen Kim's cameo as the assassin Karen Kim is pretty funny.\n\nComposers Robert Rodriguez and RZA do a great job building suspense and an epic feel for Kill Bill: Vol. 2's grand atmosphere. Costume designers Catherine Marie Thomas, Kumiko Ogawa, Kanani Wolf, and Daniel Grant North nail cool jackets and jeans for Uma Thurman and a stylish suit for Daryl Hannah. They give Bill an old Western villain aesthetic too. Make-up artists Heba Thorisdottir and Tysuela Hill-Scott do such fine work to Gordon Liu's Pai Mei.\n\nIn all, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is a riveting 136 minutes of action and drama.",

Kill Bill Vol. 1 did a lot of the setup for the movie already and Kill Bill Vol. 2 was mostly the same. The fight in the caravan was fantastic, the Japanse master is solid and the ending is pretty great, as in almost all Tarentino movies, however i would have liked a fight between the bride and Bill at the end, now it was mostly dialog. Overall the 2 movies combined are solid work, however dont reach the height it could have reached.",

It is not as messy as the previous film, but it is a cohesive, high-quality revenge drama. The process of Beatrix Kiddo's reemergence after her burial is truly hilarious, although it gets a little boring from the scene where she meets Bill. It's hard to argue with \"Vol. 1,\" but \"Vol. 2\" is my personal favorite.",

She continues the bloodbath she started in Volume 1, leading to the satisfying and surprising confrontation with Bill. However, I can't help but fell that Volume 2 was more of an afterthought.

So when she's supposed to be on a mission she never returns. While Bill is tracking down her killers she finds her alive, pregnant, and getting married. He gets pissed off and he and his assassins kill her. When Beatrix confronts him about it later he says he overreacted. Great ending with the way Beatrix kills Bill and ends up with her daughter",

            "content": "'Kill Bill: Volume 2' almost feels like an entirely different beast from Part 1. The pace is slowed down, action scenes are fewer and there is far more story unpacked in between to add some needed context and develop the character of \"The Bride\" a lot more. Where \"Volume 1\" is a dizzyingly stylish action-movie teaser, 'Volume 2' is more of a character-driven bulk of the \"Kill Bill\" story. Where Part 1 showcased \"The Bride\" as a badass of almost mythic prepositions, with some moments of needed vulnerability, while Part 2 reveals her as a fully-realized female character.  She is understandably more anger driven and brutal in Part 1 and Part 2 develops her character's motives coming from a place of love and disappointment. This added depth given to \"The Bride\" and a number of other character is by far 'Volume 2\" most impressive attribute.\n\n\nThe cadence of this flick feels a lot more like a typical Tarantino movie, with long passages of deliberately paced scenes packed with pages of Tarantino's trademark dialogue and abrupt bursts of violence. It is never dull per say but I can say it is not as constantly entertaining as Part 1. Most of the scenes focused on Michael Madsen's Budd character drag a bit but maybe that was intended to illustrate how much of a loser this guy kind of is. There are plenty of terrific set-pieces scattered though-out and Tarantino's eye for violence remains quite captivating. The performances across both volumes are great. David Carradine is particularly mesmerizing as Bill. The man just oozes cool with his soothing voice and calm demeanor; you can believe this guy can be an unhinged asshole BUT he can help but enjoy whenever he is on-screen. \n\n\nPart 1 might have indulged in its stylish excess, it was still tightly structured with a runtime under two hours. Part 2 can be a bit over-indulgent in spots over two hours. There are a couple of scenes that could have trimmed down or cut out entirely; namely a scene with a creepy Spanish pimp named Esteban or Bill monologuing about a fascinating observation about Superman before reaching a point. But the movie sticks its landing in the end. I'm not sure how the four hour cut of the \"Kill Bill\" story would pan out with the two halves being tonally different from each other. However, not one can work without the other. Split the story into two certainly gives cinephiles a chance to appreciate two different ways of telling a story on the screen; It is literally combining style (\"Volume 1\") with substance ('Volume 2') and the Whole Bloody Affair of \"Kill Bill\" is an ambitious, imaginative fever-dream of Tarantino's pop culture influences and it is crazy how much it works. - 8/10 (B+)",

            "content": "Coming off the high of the first Vol. of Kill Bill, the second should have been no problem, since it's obviously the other half the film, right? Unfortunately, the genre blending and high octane energy of the first is mellowed out in a more sentimental yet, restrained second half that many boast as superior, when in reality it's just more-or-less a bit underwhelming. It may simply be the eye-candy of the first speaking, but the crux problem here is how more somber the tale becomes. What made the first a wild ride, was how far Tarantino blended genres together, weaving a narrative of films that have been lost in the rest of the world. Either the usage of actual anime to tell the backstory of O-Ren Ishii, to the mastery of knowing when to let the style go loose, only to recede back into the narrative, and among other things. While many state that Kill Bill Vol. 1 was the last great film from Tarantino, which is not true, I can understand if it was the last true time where genre blending was used so profoundly and masterfully. Because that, I agree, can be a debatable case. What made Kill Bill such a ride was the mixing of genres: Western, action, romance, etc. As a whole (both films) are unique idiosyncrasies, straight from the mind of Tarantino; meshing older films together to create something raw and yet controlled. The story itself is not terrible actually. The film bothers to give more depth to The Bride as her hunt continues to find and Kill Bill. Not only do we get to see how she became who she was, but we also see a stronger emphasis on Romance and connection between The Bride and Bill. I've stated that I believe this is the closest thing we'll get to a real romantic film from Tarantino. As both parts play seamlessly together to make this point. And what we get is the best romance out of any films he's made - except maybe Jackie Brown (1997). But the whole film feels rather pulpy, and too solemnly. Out of all Tarantino films he's made, this one is really discouraging for me to re-watch. I've seen the original film multiple times, each viewing easily improving upon the last. But this one is rather monotonous and tedious in pacing. Ironically having great scenes, the Superman speech alone is one of the best monologues ever written by Tarantino, and the tension in the final moments between the two lovers are effective, heartbreaking and yet satisfying. The film just drags out, unfortunately. No matter how good the action scenes are, it misses that wild spark of the original. Tarantino showed us how he mellowed down with his opus, Jackie Brown (1997) and Once Upon A Time In Hollywood (2019). Kill Bill was already an effective action/thriller, but the first also had a strong dramaturgy in it's core, which is why even when the film went overboard, it could be brought back down; it's that masterful technical and storytelling aspect that's so rare to see. While I do conclude Tarantino as one of the greatest working directors of our time, Kill Bill vol. 2 is certainly not the best example. It had some great aspects, but it's not enough for a bloated 2 hour and 30 minute runtime that could have been done shorter and with a sense of fun, passion and color.",

They complete each other in so many ways that I think it would be a completely unfair disservice not to, as I would give them both lower scores individually as they have flaws that the other volume makes up for in spades. This was originally intended as a 4 hour epic and BOY does it feel like one without ever slowing down pacing-wise like any movie half as long tends to feel trying to get the same approach. There's a very cheesy, self-indulgent, ultraviolent quality to volume 1 that's endearing and a wise, heartfelt finale with more restraint in the second that balance out perfectly. Together, you can't complain about the heartless violence when you want something more thoughtful or the lack thereof of the former in a revenge flick in the later because you've already had it. I personally prefer volume 2 over 1 because I enjoy the emotional attachment and the brains attached to what seemed like just a silly martial arts movie structured like a video game. It's all so well filmed and made that together make me want to rewatch the whole bloody affair just talking about it. But independently, yes, you could complain that volume 2 is anticlimactic as there's not much violence and that volume 1 is too violent too early, but together you get more than you asked for. Together, long stretches in volume 2 feel like small footnotes in a larger journey, the way they're intended to by the ten chapter structure. Together, this is a pretty complete film. Together, I give Kill Bill: Volumes 1 + 2 (I have not seen \"the whole bloody affair\") a 9.5/10!",

It's clear to see, the modern western style has influenced many films after, and I even think that something like the Fargo TV series borrows much of its non-Coen influences from this. \n\nBill is finally introduced and he's a force of nature. A supreme being that elevates Tarantino's script to unfathomable levels. He's maybe the most perfect villain. \n\nThe Chinese martial arts are a nice compliment to Volume 1's Japanese swordplay. The endless painful training blends well with the melancholic tone, every scene of the film fraught with regret and fear, the music all brilliant, wistful and deeply sad. The characters on Beatrix's list are all losers this time, flawed and miserable and damaged, perfect foils for her as her revenge story draws to a close. \n\nPacing is slow but well constructed and allows for breathing room instead of the OCD and ADD of Volume 1. And that finale, the brilliant casting of B.B., the conversation in that perfect house, it's all lovely stuff, memorable and absolutely worth the wait.",

I cannot emphasize more on how beautifully does this satisfying sequel carries the first one. If you were a bit squeamish in your first time, you will feel safe and more importantly enjoy this time- I'm talking about the film, The Film- with a neater narration in the driver's seat. Although I'd say that the writer and director Quentin Tarantino seemed a bit insecure about this volume. For he had kept all the cards hidden for this round. And hence, it could grow hefty for the viewers. But then you should never complain for too much substance.\n\nFor stylizing all the choreography on the other hand is Uma Thurman. By this half, she has sunken her teeth well enough to scare you. Her underrated performance knocks you down not by those one liners- never by them, in fact- or cool action tricks but sorrow and regret in her eyes, in her revenge when she claims it. That baffling response is surprising and human, tricking us into believing her. The film also covers the training of Thurman's character which focuses on balancing the emotions.\n\nBut I think it is the humble nature, the admiration that these so called \"bad guys\" have for the protagonist and the situation they find themselves in, is the actual nail in the coffin. Every kill, ever body that Thurman redeems tales something from her and us, and in order to portray that, Tarantino never rushes out the event. The calmness that these characters hold amidst the swooshing and whooshing of the cameras, never makes zero sense. The family in Kill Bill Vol. 2 that she returns to, that she is a part of, is familiar to us.",

Tarantino's love of movies and his perfectionism always comes across in his movies which is one of the things I love most about them. Kill Bill v 2 is choreographed brilliantly with excellent fight scenes and inventive characters with some great lines. I don't think the film holds up entirely well but just enough to work, there are parts which seem a bit stodgy and annoying but they're mostly outweighed by the positives. Tarantino (as usual) directs stylishly, adding a real zip to the sequences and shoots the longer parts of dialogue effectively. It's an enjoyable film but compared to some of his best work it's nothing on them. ",

The story was the best part, making a big conclusion stand out and finishing a cool revenge story.

            "content": "According to Uma Thurman, Tarantino had her watch three movies to prepare for this film: John Woo's \"The Killer,\" Pam Grier in \"Coffy,\" and Sergio Leone's \"A Fistful of Dollars.\" If that sounds awesome to you, then the Kill Bill films are for you! Part two of what was originally planned as a 4-hour plus epic tale of revenge is even better than the first part. If Vol. 1 was primarily a homage to Asian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s, this installment is more a homage to westerns, particularly spaghetti westerns. Nods to others are certainly present (blaxploitation, rednecksploitation, muscle car movies, etc.), but this is primarily a western, which is wonderfully set up by Michael Madsen's down-on-his-luck international assassin character, Buck. Madsen's character could have simply been another sadistic Mr. Blond sociopath, but Buck has a tragic element to him. He was part of an elite group of international assassins, but he's now living in a trailer in the middle of the desert, working as a bouncer at a run down strip club, and even had to hock his Hattori Hanzo sword. Tarantino manages to give Buck a fair amount of character depth with minimal screen time, which is always a great thing to see. Though I think the action highlight of the film has to be the showdown between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah as the deadly one-eyed Elle Driver. Hannah had largely been absent from any films of note for quite some time, unless you count the Grumpy Old Men films ten years earlier and has sadly been absent from much since then, but she is terrific as Driver. I think a lot of credit also has to go to fight choreographer Yuen Woo Ping for the amazing fight between Thurman and Hannah in buds trailer. Tarantino also gets a lot of credit for selecting some truly badass Ennio Morricone music for their final moments. Tarantino includes in his cast some other cool character actors including Gordon Liu (as a white bearded kung-fu master this time), Sid Haig, and Larry Bishop. And then there is David Carradine as Bill, who finally show his face on screen this time, and who is excellent. I can't imagine anyone else playing this role, even though there were some very cool other actors under consideration to play Bill before Carradine was cast. As with most Tarantino films, this is not a film to suit all tastes, but for those who enjoy Tarantino's aesthetic, this film is a real treat.",

I wanted this movie to be better than the first but now showing all the big secrets is what I wanted in the first film, it's not a bad thing but during the entire first movie I wanted an answer to why the bride hates Bill and the emotion between them, I like that their daughter and father because it shows a deeper tone in the movie because how could the dad shoot her own daughter.

The conversations are so interesting and the plot just sucked me right in. Yhe uses of colours such as yellow when The Bride is in kill mide and blue when more passive or showing other people using blue against her. The uses of white in her training sequence is also masterful as it matches the master. It has a deeper meaning behind it all and is suprisingly moving although you really need to suspend disbelief here. The editing during the talking scenes is mostly perfect, pausing at the right moments and cutting quickly or randomly when necesary. For example at the beginning the bride and Bill converse. Here it slowly cutrs to them individually as is showing distance. The editing here is very slow and as they move it sometimes panning to the feet. By doing this he creates a feeling of two distinctive sides.. Good and bad for example and creates tension as they approach. He then uses a wide to show both in the same image when finally close enough and remains there for a while. This again raises questions as to who is this man and what is their history by mantaining the shot in one place. The problem with this movie is that it goes too over the top for its own good and some chapters, especially the training one although entertaining just a tad abrubt. Gotta love Tarantino and his masterfull screenplays and direction.",

The action, the style and the amazing soundtrack were all present, but the script was slightly lacking. In Volume 2, some much needed character development is finally realised, and the notorious Tarantino dialogue has returned. I felt much more invested this time round, in both the character of 'The Bride' as well as her endeavour. Bill is fleshed out, and the whole revenge plot finally takes on some deeper meaning, rather than just a bunch of cool fight scenes. Those fight scenes, by the way, are still absolutely there, but they feel more grounded; which I also appreciated. She doesn't take on a room full of people and emerge as the last woman standing like in Vol. 1. Instead, she appears much more vulnerable, and the fights are all one-on-one; making them far more engaging. I still have a problem with the way Tarantino has structured the story - in terms of how some parts are told out of order. It worked really well in some of his other movies like 'Pulp Fiction', but it doesn't quite have the desired impact here. Certain scenes, like Vol. 1, are also in black and white, and the reasons for this - whether it be stylistic or otherwise - were a poor choice because it does take you out of the movie. Luckily, in Vol. 2, it's far less prevalent. The performances are all great, and by the end Uma Thurman has really come into her own as this character. It was definitely a step above the previous instalment, and I would highly recommend seeking it out.",

That is because, after all the insane action in the first movie, this one gets more of the smaller moments. There are a number of monologues, which are really excellent, but when you come into them from the more action-packed first half you're bound to be let down. It makes perfect sense that, after the over-the-top excess of the Crazy 88 scene, it was time to go smaller and more subdued. Tarantino definitely makes the right choices in Kill Bill Volume 2, it just would work better as the second half of a single film. Enough with being down on this movie, though, because I really liked it as well. The showdowns with Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah were a treat (and got me to laugh out loud more than once,) and the flashbacks to her training made sense and also created a great reference point for other moments in this film. Perhaps the most surprising thing for me was the final showdown with Bill. It was one of those moments where I thought \"how are they going to make this even remotely as strong as what came before?\" Yet when I saw the conclusion I couldn't imagine it going any other way. Everything that was good about part 1 continued here in part 2, so I don't have much more to say. This is a great film, and the only thing that could have made it better would be if it were all one. In the future I'm sure I'll watch the 2 back-to-back and always treat it as one long film, so I think it will remain my favorite Tarantino film by far (although I could always be surprised by something new, you never know.)",

If any QT movie was in need of Sally Menke giving it a rigorous chop, Death Proof aside, then this would and should have been the one. The double bill, always intended to be a single outing turned into a 2 part money making machine, suffers from being overly baggy, lacking substance and lacking any form of producer focus. Vol 2 see's Uma Thurman's, The Bride, now named Beatrix Kiddo, continue her bloody war path as she puts herself and everyone in her path, through hell, to get to her most prized target, Bill. Where Vol 1 at least had a frenetic energy to it, its completely clear that it also had all the punch, leaving Vol 2 to pick up all the pieces and cumbersome exposition. Vol 2 slogs along at a snails pace, taking a distinctly different approach than its sibling and ultimately leaving this double bill as more a mish mash of ideas rather than any coherent story. However with all its self indulgence, Vol 2 also offers up some brilliant cinematic moments that make it more riveting and iconic than your average 2 part film outing. A flash back to The Bride's training after she has been buried alive, is without a doubt the movies strongest moment, bolstering comedy, action and indeed a huge sense of anxiety for the protagonist. The much awaited confrontation between Ellie Driver and The Bride is also entertainingly brutal and expertly choreographed, giving the movie a much needed jolt towards the end. But Vol 2 just cannot shake its excess weight and sluggish pacing, and by the finale you will be fighting the urge to check your phone or indeed fall asleep. Kill Bill is ultimately a film maker in his prime, trying to cram as much inspiration into an outing as possible, on the whole some of it works brilliantly, our protagonist, the stylish visuals, the RZA's brilliant soundtrack, solid supporting actors and some intensely violent and harrowing moments and then of course there is the yawn inducing, self absorbed, drawn out dialogue, a structure so inconsistent you wonder if the film will even show up for the finale and indeed the overwhelming sense that this film is just not meant to be. Kill Bill Vol 2 will satisfy fans of QT on a very basic level, but as part of a bigger picture, its a wasted opportunity.",

It continues, but there is less of it as none of these villains rely on heavy arsenals of \"bodyguards\" as in the case of Cottonmouth in vol. 1.\nThe main thing this film accomplishes is that it fleshes out the main characters - The Bride and Bill - so much more than in the first installment. We actually get to see Bill's face throughout the film, witness the two having real conversations to develop their relationship, and we even witness some complex emotions from the Bride. Where the first Kill Bill was fun, vol. 2 is more about the characters.\nThis is not to say that vol. 2 is not a fun film. It is extremely fun - my friend audibly expressed satisfaction at certain moments throughout the film as it was his first time watching volumes 1 and 2 over the past two days. It is also notably very tense towards the conclusion of the film, and in this film Tarantino once again proves to be the master of the monologue with a great segment in which the mythology of a super hero is discussed. It certainly doesn't match up to the intro to Inglourious Basterds or Calvin Candie's monologue in Django Unchained, but its placement in the film is nearly perfect.\nOne disappointing factor of this movie is that, in my opinion, it seems to have a cop out instead of a well fleshed conclusion. I can't say much past this without a major spoiler, so I'll say you simply have to watch the movie to see what I am referring to. In a movie that incorporates the martial arts the conclusion may satisfy some, but I think it is a tad ridiculous compared to the rest of the two films put together.\nWhile this film may impress me just a little less than the first, I am still eager to see The Whole Bloody Affair at a theater in my lifetime if I get the opportunity.\n3.0/4.0",

            "content": "After re-watching Kill Bill: Vol. 1 of course I had to re-see Vol. 2 as well. At the end of Vol. 1 everything slowly came back to me. Why was this movie cut up in two parts again? How did I feel about it in 2004? How did I feel about it a decade later?\n\nLike I said in my last review, Quentin Tarantino directed this movie and he wrote the story together with lead actress Uma Thurman. Thurman plays Beatrice Kiddo, also known as The Bride, who wakes up from a coma after four years to find that her unborn child is gone and that she was betrayed by a team of assassins that she used to be part of.\n\nBoth movies document the payback rampage she embarks on. While the first keeps the back story to a minimum, this second part delves deep into the history of Beatrice Kiddo. \n\nProblem is, from all the flashbacks and hints in the first movie, you already know what went on. Here, Tarantino is merely colouring a more elaborate picture of the set he's already outlined well enough for the story to hold.\n\nSo here I was with 130 of the 137 minutes still to go, thinking: \"Oh yeah, I remember this. This is going to be long and drawn out and with a lot of bumps in the road.\"\n\nAnd my memory served me well. Again, a decade later, I was wondering why this tale was cut up into two parts. So of course I looked it up. Thanks, Google. Seems like the story in 2003 was that the original movie was indeed intended to be 4 hours long and that the production company wanted to cut it in two parts because no audience would want to sit down that long. Or something close to that, depending on what source you visit.\n\nThis doesn't make sense to me. Granted, it's a plausible theory, something not many people would contend. But alas, I am a Cookie Monster, not people, and I am not satisfied with this explanation.\n\nVol.2 clearly was produced at the same time as Vol.1 with the same cast and production value. But the editing is quite different. Whereas Vol. 1 (111 minutes) flowed at a pleasant and regular pace, Vol 2 (137 minutes) seemed deliberately slowed down, while not really adding much to the back story that was absolutely necessary.\n\nIf I had enough time (which I don't, obviously, I barely have enough time to write all these reviews) I would load both installments into my Adobe Premiere and create my own edit to prove the following point: If you'd edit Vol. 2 the way Vol. 1 was done, removed all double scenes between the two installments and removed the double credit sequences, you'd end up with a running time under two and a half hours, which is perfectly fine for a single theatre release.\n\nAnyway, I read some boo-hoos about how it was not easy for the production company to have to market this twice and have the second installment come out at a bad time for the Academy Awards, etc. Cowcrap, if you ask me. Just the news of the two installments was enough promo in itself, and why does no-one mention that all fans and viewers had to pay double the money to see the whole story?\n\nPros: You have to see it to know how it ends\nCons: Slow, unneccesarily drawn out.\nVerdict: Meh, go see if you wanna know how it ends",

Dialogue driven of course by the talented director Quentin Tarantino. Great use of back story and flashbacks that fits the plot into a well put together puzzle. The humor of course is darkly funny but, this time the humor is perfectly used and not forced nor distracting. Old and new characters have magnificent depth with realistic characteristics. The movie itself is unpredictable and keeps you on the edge of your seat to see what happens next. A booming stylistic soundtrack that fits the whole tone of the film. My problem with the film is the long run time. Yeah I know its a Tarantino and they are usually long but worth it. With this one though it feels overly long and some signs of being dragged on towards the end. The movie needed a little more action in my opinion to raise the tension more to the highest point. Yeah and some scenes are a little too over the top that is sometimes distracting. Overall, \"Kill Bill Vol. 2\" is a great sequel that is better than is predecessor with more cohesive plot building and dialogue. Which is a fun time watching it with entertaining action scenes and backstory to use more depth into the plot and characters. I will give this movie an A grading!",

Tarantino is a great filmmaker and Kill Bill is a blast from start to finish.\n\nTrue, this might be the less inspired movie he's made so far when it comes to dialogues, instantly classic characters and it plods a little on the desert sequence but I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy every single bit of it. From the explosions of stylistic over the top gore, to the incredible cinematography, to the sheer brilliance of the pacing (giving us new things at every turn), Kill Bill is a difficult movie for those who won't be able to appreciate some of the camp and out of nowhere violent jolts, but all of this weird soup fortunately works together.\n\nI loved this all much more the second time around and I bet I'll love it more on my third.",

            "content": "The only way to properly review this is to review it as it should be. As one film. After \"Pulp Fiction'', director Quentin Tarantino spoke with Uma Thurman about doing a female led action film. Several years later, \"Kill Bill'' was made. The film was split into two parts, both telling the same story. The film stars Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Sonny Chiba, Vivica A. Fox, Gordon Liu, and Julie Dreyfus. If I had to explain the film in one sentence it would be: classic western meets Mexican mafia ninja warriors with an 80's vibe. Tarantino is known for making balls to the walls crazy films and Kill Bill could be his craziest. That being said, these films are not for everyone. I know plenty of people who hate them. If that's you, you can leave now, because these two films are some of the most impressive action movies I've ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe film follows Beatrix \"Black Mamba\" Kiddo (Thurman), a young women seeking revenge. On the day of her wedding rehearsal, Black Mamba is killed by Bill and her former team of fellow assassins. She lays in a coma for four years. When she wakes she realizes her baby has been lost and she vows to kill Bill for what he did. She goes on a killing rampage, killing off every member of her old assassin team until she makes it to the top. Until she makes it to Bill.\n\nAs a director, Tarantino is known for his crazy, bloody, and off beat films. Some people may not like his movies, but I love them. He does a phenomenal job with these films. This guy's first film was so good, it was like he was born a professional filmmaker. This movie is directed in such a artistic and energetic way. It shows how great this guy is. The script is also solid, showing true in the second volume. The second film has allot of smart dialogue that flows off the screen. The cinematography is done by Robert Richardson. He does a decent job filming the first volume, but the second was filmed even better. I loved the camera work in the second film. It was noticeably better and more precise. The performances in this movie are pretty good. Obviously, Uma Thurman steals the show, giving not only a solid performance, but kicking major a**. She really did a good job. I assume she had a stunt actor do allot of her stunts, but man where they good stunts.\n\nNot only does this film have a good story, but it has amazing action. It's fast, stylish, and bloody. The fights are so well choreographed, and I have to give credit to the geniuses behind the stunts. Keith Adams and Woo-ping Yuen did phenomenal jobs with the stunts. Every stunt was uniq and exciting. The fight scenes were choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping, and they were so amazing. Every sword fight was intense, every knife fight was nail bitting. You can tell the man behind the fights knows what he's doing. \n\nAdmittedly, the second volume isn't as exciting as the firs when it comes to action. It's a little slower as its predecessor, and lacks the engergy it had. However, it's not quite fair to say that seeing as I consider it to be one single film. The second one simply focus more on story than on action. That doesn't mean it's not a bit slow at times, but this is mostly forgivable. \n\n\"Kill Bill'' is a film that may put off allot of people, but it will please die hard Tarantino fans for sure. I think it may be his best film next to \"Pulp''. It's definitely one of the most impressive action films ever made. It's well directed, beautifully shot, well written, features great performances, has thrilling action, and tells a fantastically engaging story.",

I wouldn't say I enjoyed it as much as the first one, but it's still a bloody good movie that brings an awesome story to a satisfying end.\nThe movie picks up right where the first left off. The Bride is still hell bent of killing her former lover, while also trying to knock off the remaining members of her former team. It is a story loaded with great writing, action reminiscent of old Samurai movies (in all their bloody glory), scenes rife with tension, as well as a surprising amount of emotional parts. I never thought I would tear up at a Tarantino movie, but today I was proven wrong. I can't spoil the terrific scene that sparked so much emotion because it really catches you off guard, and it's a big contributor to the plot. Unlike the first movie, this one is a bit more complex in its plot, and it took a few unpredictable turns along the way, which is by no means a bad thing. The only complaint I have about the movie is that the beginning is pretty slow. The first one sucked you right in the second it started.

The second part to this Tarantino film series starred the same people from the first part with the inclusion of a brief Samuel L Jackson cameo. While the second part had more smooth dialogue and interesting conversations, it had less of the fun action that the first part possessed. Part of what made the first part so entertaining for me was the stylish fun action, given that barely any scenes lived up to those standards it made me a bit disappointed. Vol. 2 wasn't a big disappointment, it did have the cool Tarantino style of filming and it had really cool action scenes but just not as enjoyable as the first. The scene that I absolutely adored in this movie was when Beatrix was training with the samurai and learned the punch move. The second part also had a really cool origin story which the first did not have. It helped out with story structure and how she learned to fight and why and also had background from the wedding rehearsal. Without comparing it to the first part, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is in no terms a bad movie. On its own it's still a great action film. The acting was really good as well as their conversations. The cool characters were given a bigger spotlight in my opinion too. The ending is kind of why I didn't give it another 1/2 star because there was a ton of buildup for the Beatrix vs Bill fight and there was barely any fight and more so discussing. I have no problem with discussions but there almost HAD to be a fight between them. Throughout she had a ton of angst and was ready to tear the people to shreds. I understand that he was jealous and stuff but I would've liked a fight, I'm sorry. Kill Bill Vol. 2 was still a great action movie that had the same awesome cast and direction that made the first part so likable. B+",

He distills what's most entertaining about genre cinema and takes the best parts and creates odd new mixtures out of the ingredients.  He writes riveting dialogue that lets him use long, dialogue driven scenes to drive his story.  He does the first in some amazing ways here ... blending ingredients from spaghetti westerns, martial arts films, horror films and other parts in new and dazzling ways.  He largely fails at the second task, or at least, fails often enough to make this film's long running time very very apparent.  There are a lot of scenes in this film don't engage, don't drive the story, and seem to exist mostly to insert actors Tarantino wants into the film (I'm looking at you Larry Bishop).  I have seen this film three times, and every time I see it, I realize I have idea what Uma Thurman and David Carradine talk about during the last 40 minutes.

Besides, the characters are fleshed out very well, and I guess we owe that to all the exposition. The film shares its stylistic flair with its predecessor, and to great effect.

After only intending to watch Vol. 1 during the night, I ended up binge-watching at 2:30 in the morning, in my pajamas, curled up at my TV screen with a hot mug of coffee in my left hand, and continued on towards Vol. 2. \n\nVol. 1 was a flawless spectacle of perfected cinematography, intriguing dialogue, and of course, over-the-top violence (not to mention an unexpected Japanese Anime scene). Seamlessly woven together through Q.T's perfectionist screenwriting, we not only had our jaws open for four hours straight, but we all felt the raw, merciless anger radiated from Thurman's perfect portrayal of \"feminine rage.\" \n\nVol. 2 continued the tradition, and might I say, added so much more. For those that did not find Vol. 1 to meet their expectations, I'm sorry to say you won't find your spirits lifted in this one. Alas, for those that have been on the edge of their seats since the incredible cliffhanger Vol. 1 has left us with, I'm glad to say you will find yourself most entertained.\n\nIt's not often I give movies a perfect score, but a cinematic feat such as this rightfully deserves the recognition.\n\n10/10.",

The scene at the church between Uma and David right before the shootout happens was my favorite. David is mesmerizing in that scene and it makes the events that happen afterwards seem all the more tragic. Lets just say after that scene, I completely understood her motivations and reasons behind her revenge. This movie had a very dark satirical humor to it as all of Tarrintino's films do.

Gone is the huge body count, and in its place, we're treated to a great story of betrayal and violence within the ranks of globe-trotting assassins for hire.\n\nIn the second installment, we learn why The Bride (Uma Thurman) tried to escape from Bill (David Carradine), and why Bill hunted her down. As we travel with The Bride on her adventures we get to learn more about her relationship with Bill, and where she received her martial arts training. The Bride is still on her quest for vengeance, but this time around instead of long drawn out flashy fight sequences, the action in volume 2 comes in short loud bangs.\n\nThis is not to say I liked one volume over the other because to be honest they are different kinds of films, and they both can be enjoyed for what they are. If anything, the slower pace of the second installment is a welcome break from all the mayhem, and actually feels more mature. The pop-culture references are toned down, and the film aims to pack a bigger emotional punch through Quentin Tarantino's superb dialog.\n\nAs with the first installment, Uma Thurman's performance shines, and it was nice to see David Carradine in front of the camera in the second film. This movie also gives Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah some very welcome screen time.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nIf you're expecting more of the same with volume 2 you will be disappointed. The body count is a lot lower in the second film, and there are less martial arts sequences. This film is slower than the first, but provides more depth. Less cool, yet more mature.\n\nBest Format:\n\nKill Bill: Volume 2 is reasonably well shot so a HD viewing at home is recommended.\n\nBest Moment: >\n\nSpoiler Alert! I've set this on my site so you have to click to reveal my favorite moment! That way it's on you if it spoils the film! ;-)\n\nhttp://talkiegazette.com/kill-bill-volume-2-2004/\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette\n\nhttp://www.twitter.com/talkiegazette",

Whether intentional or not, there is noticeable difference between Volumes 1 and 2 in pacing and style. Unlike the first part, this movie really transcends traditional genre lines and injects more dialogue and saccharinity  into the story of the Bride.\n\nUltimately, what makes me so appreciative of this second half to the story is that it is able to complement the first so well. All the Deadly Vipers are now accounted for, and not all in the ways we expected. We see David Carradine's face and then see his take on things. And finally we see the legendary Five Point Finger Exploding Heart Technique. With all the madness and bloodshed, it all ends and things are done right by the Bride.",

I liked that it was character focused and we got to see some more backstory, but the movie just felt like a snooze to me. I enjoyed a few fight sequences in this movie but it certainly has nothing as memorable as the fights in \"Volume 1.\" Uma Thurman is good again and her character is still certainly likable, but it's not enough to save the movie.

            "content": "I honestly think that if you combine volume 1 & 2, and view it as one big movie, Kill Bill can be way better. In my opinion, this isn't a series of  2 movies. It's one big epic that was split apart for whatever reason by production, and it really brings this story down. For full effect, next time I revisit Kill Bill, I'm gonna try and give it all a go in one sitting, instead of seeing them as two different movies. They're really not.\n\nIn volume 2, The Bride's journey is slowed down, when her foes become much more aware of her rampage, challenging her in many different ways. Along the way, the whole narrative slows down to tell more stories of origins, and background to the whole story. The Bride is slowly crossing off the names on her kill list, to the point where she is finally face to face with Bill, her final boss.\n\nVolume 2 is a completely different experience from Volume 1. Volume 1 hits you hard, and spits blood from the screen as the bodies just pile up. It's high octane combat, with a bit of story in the background. It's exciting, but Volume 2 doesn't bring more of that. Volume 2 stops right in it's tracks and gives you more story, more origins, and more character development through the use of Tarantino's slick dialogue. It's still quite funny and campy, but a lot more dramatic. It's a bit longer, but that's welcome with a revenge story this interesting.\n\nHowever, this one moves much slower than the first part. I hate comparing sequels to predecessors, and parts of series to each other, but sometimes it's inevitable. The pacing changes completely here, and while there are still some great action scenes, Volume 2 does a good job on focusing on the importance of the bride's revenge. We see more from her perspective, creating a more intense hunger for her well deserved revenge. It's well done, but I can't help but feel some of the stuff in Volume 2 features some of the poorer writing on Tarantino's behalf. Even though this is the case, Tarantino's average writing is still better than half of hollywood. Kill Bill as a whole can be seen as a revenge epic that works as a great tribute to spaghetti westerns and samurai films, but is more importantly a great big reminder from Tarantino on what it means to go to the  movies and be entertained.\n\nKill Bill Vol. 2 gets slower and more serious, but features enough sharp dialogue and story development to provide a solid conclusion to the revenge epic.",

Again lots of Tarantino's favorite genres were mixed up to a strong and very entertaining unity. The first part was utter genius, but I must confess that I was a bit disappointed by this second volume. It was still good, but a different feeling. The battle with Budd and even Elle could have been more spectacular, just as the climax: the moment she faces the last name on her list. Starring Vivica A. Fox (Independence Day), Lucy Liu (Charlie's Angels), Michael Madsen (Reservoir Dogs), Daryl Hannah (Blade Runner), Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction) as the Bride and David Carradine (Kunf Fu) as Bill. With guest appearances of Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction) and Sid Haig (Coffy). She's back for the final cut! \n\nWith O-ren Ishii (Liu) and Vernita Green (Fox) dead, the Bride (Thurman) continues her vengeance quest to kill her former boss Bill (Carradine), his brother Budd (Madsen) and the one-eyed Elle Driver (Hannah), who were all responsible for the Wedding Massacre at the Two Pines four years earlier. The next on her death list is Budd, who works as a bouncer in a strip club and lives his lonely life in a trailer. But he expects her and is able to capture the woman, putting her in a coffin and burying her alive. Claustrophobic and tied up, the Bride remembers the training Bill made her follow from martial arts master Pai Mei. Can she escape and get her bloody satisfaction?",

However Kill Bill volume 2 is still a great film. It's a very good way to rap up all the loose ends. Has some amazing scenes, the bride being buried alive is the first one that comes to mind. Uma Thurman is excellent as are the other actors. I think it all wraps up very well. However one problem and its a very common one about this movie is the climax between Bill and the Bride. Now we do get some excellent dialogue in this film, but after the whole crazy 88 fight scene at the end of the last movie you kind of hope that the fight between Bill and the Bride would be better but it's extremely short.

I consider Kill Bill as one of Tarantino's weaker films, and Volume 2 is definitely a big reason why it's a letdown.\n\nThe film is written by Quentin Tarantino and what he has written here is much more dialogue and story heavy than the first volume. I enjoyed the first volume a lot more because it is much more fun and stylish, this second volume holds back much more of that in service to the story which wasn't all that great to begin with. Normally heading towards the end, a film with this story should be much more intense than the first half but that's not the case. The bulk of the build up of the climax is dull due to the underwhelming dialogue, though the pregnancy test sequence was hilarious. The climax itself would have been a great opportunity for Tarantino to write something spectacular and thrilling, yet it felt like Tarantino couldn't find some sort of vision of it and just wrote something that can be done swiftly. I know Tarantino can write because he has proven it with great dialogue-driven films like Pulp Fiction and Death Proof or mainstream action driven films like Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained. Kill Bill combines both aspects together and proved to be ineffective. The film's story isn't all bad with an interesting burial segment and a throwback to the old Kung-Fu Chinese films that had me smiling throughout.\n\nTarantino directs this film with a much more slower pace, in order to flesh out the story and gain more insight to it's characters. This film at times feels too safe for me, with moments that have characters just talking, which I don't mind if the dialogue was written better, leaving me feeling underwhelmed. Kill Bill as a whole's best moments are the segments that are over the top, violent and experimental. These experimental moments include the Pai Mei chapter, feeling like it was from a 1980's cheesy Kung Fu film. If Tarantino treated this half of the film like the first half then Kill Bill as a whole would have been an instant favorite of mine.\n\nRobert Richardson comes back as the director of photography for this film and this time the scenes don't look as hyper stylised and overly saturated as the first volume. I do admire the fact that this film doesn't look the same the entire run of the film, with moments in black and white, changing the aspect ratio of the film, and using split screen to show two things at once. The Pai Mei sequence was shot in such a way that is similar to the old Asian Kung Fu films, with grainy photography and lacking in vibrancy in it's color. Though there are great moments in this volume's photography, I much prefer the style that was applied for the first volume.\n\nRZA didn't come back to do the score for this film, which is odd as I liked what he did for the first volume. Instead Robert Rodriguez is credited for the music of the film, I am sure that he did the final song but I am not aware of any other moments in where he might have contributed. The film's music still follows that inspiration of Ennio Morricone, with some tracks actually written from him, and gives the film this Western feel to it. There are also moments where it uses Asian inspired music which works well with the tone of the film. The sound effects of this film is hilarious as they use the cheesy effects that are found on the films that this was inspired by. I wish that this film does retain that upbeat and fun soundtrack that fueled the first volume, but I guess that would be inappropriate judging by the events that unfolds during this film.\n\nUma Thurman as The Bride is still great but this time it seems the film demands more from her and she does a great job. She may seem less bad-ass here because vulnerabilities arise and there are times where she is outmatched by her opponent which we didn't see a lot from the first volume. I felt that Bill was a little dull because of the way Tarantino has written him, but David Carradine does the most he can with the character. Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen as Elle and Budd were fun to watch as they play characters that are classic Tarantino; fun, hilarious, and unpredictable. I wish Madsen were in much more entertaining films because he is a wonderful actor to watch. Gordon Liu as Pai Mei was definitely hilarious and written with such absurdity that anything that comes out his mouth is pure comedic gold or bad-ass.\n\nKill Bill Volume 2 is a bit of a disappointment in comparison to the first volume and the other films in the director's catalogue.

The conversations may be slow in this film, and they may take away from the fast pace, but I would not find fault with that, were the conversations actually interesting or compelling in any way. Apart from Bill's brief spiel about Superman, there is not a word of compelling or interesting conversation in the movie. The story of The Bride is, frankly, not all that interesting or intelligent. Conversations about it are not either. Tarantino's really misstepped with his own formula this time, and that's unfortunate. At least his next two films are some of the greatest ever made.

Fox and Samuel L. Jackson, Volume 2 spends a lot of time delving into the past of The Bride (Thurman), which adds weight to her character at the expense of moving forward the revenge storyline of the film.\n\nThe result is a vaguely mismatched film.

When this chapter in the story begins, The Bride will have already encountered some of her targets, as she continues battling her way up the chain of command, knowing it will ultimately lead her to her main goal: her chance to 'Kill Bill.'\nMy Review\n\"Looked dead, didn't I? But I wasn't. But it wasn't from lack of trying, I can tell you that. Actually, Bill's last bullet put me in a coma. A coma I was to lie in for four years. When I woke up, I went on what the movie advertisements refer to as a 'roaring rampage of revenge.' I roared. And I rampaged. And I got bloody satisfaction. I've killed a hell of a lot of people to get to this point, but I have only one more. The last one. The one I'm driving to right now. The only one left. And when I arrive at my destination, I am gonna kill Bill.\" Kill Bill: Vol. 2 explores the past of The Bride, particularly about who trained her. Her master was Pai Mei (Gordon Liu), who is in fact an actual character of old school martial arts movies. Though this character wasn't originally created by Tarantino, he's truly a strong element of the film, and although he may be seen as clich\u00e9, there's no doubt he's very memorable. In fact, all the characters are memorable. Bill, who is actually my favourite villain of Kill Bill, has the most genius dialogue ever. Budd is hilarious, as well as being a bad guy who we feel quite sympathetic for. Then we have Elle Driver. She's brilliant. Truly brilliant. She's a cold hearted bitch, but that doesn't mean that she isn't a badass. She is a total badass. She's one hell of a villain. The Bride returns just as fantastic as she was in Vol. 1, and we find out her real name as well. Tarantino goes into a lot of detail to explain how this story came to be, with wedding and The Bride's pregnancy. If you loved Vol. 1, then experiencing the backstory of it is just as enjoyable. There are one liners that are truly sensational, and above all else, you have a kick-ass heroine.",

            "content": "This movie disappointed me on so many levels. Right off the bat I could tell what kind of movie this was going to be and I was not wrong in my judgement. In the first 10 minutes you could tell that this movie was going to be nothing but talking and right then even at a very meagre 10 minutes I was already getting bored. I wasn't expecting a copy and paste scenario where the same things happened from film to film but I don't think it's too outlandish to expect the same sort of thing from movie to movie. I was expecting more stylish and outrageous fight sequences and style changes, but nope. Im sure all the dialogue has a purpose but I really did not care at all. It feels like all the energy was sucked out of the movie and what we have in its place is a film that has no idea what it wants to do. \n\nIf I didn't already know that Tarantino directed both, I wouldn't have guessed that he did. This movie had such little style in it and pretty much everything that made the first movie, the first movie. The only flair he brought to this was one scene where he made the camera smaller so it looked like we were trapped with The Bride at one point and that was it. What we have in it's place is a completely pointless flashback sequence that lasts about 20 minutes to explain one point in the film, which really was not needed at all. She could have just punched her way out of that scenario without a long flashback. This movie was also too long for its own good. Clocking in at 2 hours and 15 minutes, a lot of this movie felt very filler. One scene in which Elle reads information about a snake, what was the point? Who cares? In the first part there was a scene in which Elle just walks down a hall whistling, it was pointless but it was also crazy fun and is one of the scenes I'll never forget. Was it silly? Sure, but it gave the movie it's identity.\n\nWith none of its outrageous humour, amazing visual style or even interesting characters, this movie has little to offer, unless you like hearing people drone on for hours about crap you don't care about. It's not like I don't like movies that have a lot of talking, the opposite is true, one of my favourite films is 'All The Kings Men' and that's nothing but talking, but it's just the tonal shift from movie to movie is too massive to ignore. This is not a bad movie by any means, I've seen bad movies... really bad movies and this does not rank there with them, trust me, I know what a bad movie is but I am just disappointed. All Tarantino needed to do was add another 40 minutes to the first film or ask for a re write of this one.",

This gives us a good deal of context for the Bride in the story and sets it up perfectly for the final stages of her quest for Revenge.  Volume 2 also serves as a forum for some of Quentin Tarantino's greatest pieces of dialogue. The action and other violence is more isolated, but one particular fight sequence lasts for a while.

Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and David Carradine take center focus, and give some truly impressive performances; especially Carradine, who steals every scene and outshines Uma Thurman.  Tarantino's dialog once again is outstanding, and is full of witty repartee that enriches the characters.

Uma Thurman returns as the Bride, just as great as she was in the first volume; she's definitely able to stretch her acting chops a little more here as opposed to fighting skills (even if there is much of both). David Carradine is quite great as well, the perfect antagonist to match the Bride's wits and strength; the entire scene they shared together at the end was the perfect tone, and was just as tense as it needed to be. I guess my main problem with this movie was that I felt there wasn't enough action toward the first half of the film; once it got its stride, though, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is no doubt a great successor and a fantastic conclusion to the epic two-part revenge story.",

I know about the history of Shaolin and what this film conveys is ridiculous. Shaolin was tormented on the late middle age by a dynasty of Chinese rulers and they cannot be killed by Pai Mei' one man army. It is absolutely senseless. Also in this film they say that Pai Mei despise Americans and has nothing but contempt for women. This film doesn't convey much reasons to why Pai Mei taught his special Heart- Exploding technique to The bride(Uma Thurman)with whom the master shares no special relationship. A person recovering from a 4 year comma is reasonable, but a woman who was shot at both her breasts by a shotgun and buried alive escapes from her grave, walks all night and then kills a well trained women fighting is quite senseless and implausible.",

The best change would be the removal of Volume I's final scene twist that was only added to tease and suspend the audience when the film was split. \n\nBut on its own, Volume II is a little slower, a little more grounded, and a little more character focused, and is certainly the half that I prefer. Taken as one story, this is a natural evolution and close to The Bride's journey, and I find the ending genuinely moving.

Volume 2 continues the story of The Bride, a former assassin on a quest for vengeance against her ex-boss Bill who attempted to assassinate her at her wedding. It clearly borrows a number of elements from Chinese martial arts movies, most notably the very clich\u00e9d, almost humorous appearance of The Bride's martial arts master Pai Mei. He has immense, bushy white eyebrows and a long flowing beard that he constantly strokes, a conscious decision by Tarantino to evoke the same kinds of movies that inspired Kill Bill in the first place. Unlike the first movie, Volume 2 only has two fight scenes, one of which is very brief, so the movie is naturally much less violent than the first. There is one exception to this that is especially gruesome at the end of the first fight, but aside from that the characters spend much more time talking than fighting. This isn't always a bad thing, although Kill Bill has one of the weaker scripts that Tarantino has written simply because he was trying so carefully to imitate the clunky dialogue of the movies that inspired it. This means that some of the dialogue-heavy scenes can get exhausting, but there's usually enough going on that you won't have time to pay much attention to the quality of the dialogue. It's not exactly the tongue-in-cheek thrill-ride that its predecessor was, but Kill Bill Volume 2 is nonetheless an entertaining movie that ends the story on a satisfying note.",

            "content": "No commenting on individual reviews anymore, huh? Well, I was bored so I thought I'd respond a bit to a very wrong-headed review from the New Yorker about this movie. Oh, that review is very wrong. The reviewer doesn't seem to understand that Quentin Tarantino is not TRYING to fetishize violence, who does? He's making an homage to the movies that he loves, to movies whose engines of thought are limited to a kind of structure that allows and disallows things the reviewer has problems with. He says the child, when her mother is murdered (Vivica Fox) in the beginning of the movie, should be bawling on the floor, completely emotionally destroyed. If that child were to act distraught, the reviewer points out, this would go on to solve most of our societal problems with violence, out of hand. A few tears, some very emotional trauma, and it's no longer a problem. What the reviewer fails to realize is that the mode and means of the movies Tarantino is honoring did not allow that. Everyone in these movies, as far as I can determine from the code of Tarantino's movie, is cool as a cat. These characters realize that people die, it's the way of their world. It's sort of a secret society which these professional killers inhabit, it's a bubble of reality that exists outside of normal society. Perhaps, also, Tarantino was trying to point out that both Beatrix's child, and Fox's character's child, are so young they don't understand what happened or the meaning of death and life. The philosophical discussion that Bill has about Bibi and the goldfish at the end of the second movie explicates this point quite well. Perhaps Tarantino is asking his audience to believe in what he is doing a little bit, as in asking us to put off disbelief for a bit while he makes a point about life and death. And after all, isn't this discussion of life and death interesting? Isn't Tarantino alluding to the conflict between Bill and Beatrix? Isn't there some character discussion here that makes the final conclusion all the more thrilling? Isn't it made clear that THIS is the means and mode, the code Tarantino has adapted for this movie, and won't be broken so that we can all feel a little better about life and death, so that a quick point about violence perpetrated by America in the middle east can be made on the fly? Why does the director have to change how his movie is made, in fact the structure of his script, so that a point may be made about how violence is naughty? Perhaps the critic should spend time critiquing the movie based on the movie's own selected code? Perhaps we should not put our own 'thing' on things, so to speak. Perhaps we should have faith in the director to create a world in which we may escape to, and expect him to be consistent in how he develops and explains this world?\r\nIn essence, I don't understand the plight the New Yorker critic is putting on Tarantino's movie here. If he wants the movie to be one thing rather than another, why doesn't he make his OWN movie? He thinks it's all sickly violence, and it's all disturbing, however I don't see a review in this. It would be much more fair to say that, perhaps, Tarantino does not spend enough time painting the landscape of his world; it would require stronger characterization for the reviewer to suspend disbelief about the violence of said movie, for example. \r\nTarantino, while an excellent director when it comes to style, and images, cannot be said to be quite the same caliber as Sergio Leone. Leone could build a broad, well painted world with substance to spare and very realized characters. I would have liked to see more intricate details of character attributed to Bill, Beatrix, and mostly all of the original gang of characters. Tarantino shows us their menacingness, but not their likes or loves, their hopes or dreams, their deepest character. Tarantino's characters are skin deep, simply images of beauty or violence who commit the most atrocious acts without a thought or care. Someone in a review on this site said Beatrix's jumpsuit was an allusion to Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee had a philosophy that described well why he fought and where the line was and how far he would go to reach the ends he desired. It has also been pointed out the similarities between Beatrix and Bruce Lee or Clint Eastwood. Neither of these actors portrayed characters who used swords, though. One was with fists and the other was with a gun. Beatrix does not use anything but a sword (or martial arts). A sword is much more personal than a gun. The New Yorker reviewer does not like gun violence, he is implying, because that is the kind of violence most common in movies (and in America and in wars). Tarantino's weapon of choice isn't just a pull of the trigger, it's penetrating flesh in the most personal, meaningful way. There's something more delicate in using a sword to kill, or fists, than a gun. Tarantino's violence is not dumbed down button pushers, but philosophical martial artists. The reviewer would have spent his time better dissecting a Stallone movie, or one of Tarantino's earlier movies, though I doubt he would have found the dumbed down violence he is looking for there, either. \r\nAnyways, I'm just thinking out loud. I may have made some contradictions, which I think speaks about just how good, and just how much substance there IS in this movie. I didn't like Kill Bill Vol. 1 way back in the day, but now after having watched it a bazillion times I'd rank it among the ten best movies of the 2000s, it's basically a sort of masterpiece. Just because there is a lot of blood doesn't mean it's a B-movie.",

Then, as I watched this flick progress more and more, the style, the feel, and even the color fullness was stale! The first edition didn't feel that way at all!\n\n\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\" left me like I was falling asleep standing up! It had its high moments, but those moments after awhile fell so steeply! Had this movie been one whole full sequence, I could say that maybe 2 1/2 stars would no doubt have been the perfect rating for the one single flick altogether!

Now: that isn't to say that KBV2 is all puppy dog smiles and rainbows. What I consider to the the best cinematic brawl in history goes down between Kiddo and Elle Driver, played by the grossly underemployed Daryl Hannah. I struggle with KBV2 simply because it feel uneven to me, and the sub-plot concerning Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) is about seven minutes too long for my patience, but, otherwise, it's a nice shot of estrogen against the testosterone-soaked KBV1, and it closes the epic of the Bride in glorious fashion.",

I'll tell you why the first movie is better than this one.

Second time around the script is stronger and Tarantino's usual pointless but interesting dialogue is truer to form. With moments of inevitable exploited violence and shockingly unsettling set pieces, Vol. 2 features everything you could want and expect of a Quentin Tarantino movie.\n\nUma Thurman continues her strong performance as 'The Bride' satisfyingly as she carries on her revengeful killing spree which inevitably leads to Bill. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah make up for the understated and forgetful performances of the first installment. Its great to see Michael Madsen back to rare form and I thoroughly enjoyed his controversial performance as Budd. There a good bit part performances from Gordon Liu and Larry Bishop also.\n\nDavid Carradine steals the show in the titular role of Bill. He's one of my favourite of Tarantino's character creations and his dialogue is the best written in the two part series. In every Tarantino film there's a stand out casting gem, who doesn't necessarily receive the plaudits but turns out to be something of an unsung hero. In the case of Kill Bill, the casting gem is without a doubt David Carradine.\n\nThe end sequence of the film is a crowd pleaser and the film ends as expected. Bill gets killed. Obviously. The action sequences are entertaining, but bar the climax everything else is pretty forgettable when compared to Vol. 1. Both films a very different and as one piece are arguably unbalanced. Vol. 1 is the most entertaining, whilst Vol. 2 is the most interesting.\n\nAs one piece I believe Kill Bill would of been much more successful. It would need shortening as combined its a four hour plus story, but there's more than enough footage that could be cut that wouldn't affect or weaken the concept. I suppose two films is twice as much fun, but I'd prefer to watch one three hour piece and be done with it as apposed to two unbalanced and very different parts. Regardless, Vol. 2 as an individual piece is typical Tarantino and despite the occasional pacing issues, the scripting and performances carry the film brilliantly.",

But whatever, Quentin brought us an amazing conclusion to his legend, he did an amazing job. Overall, did you loved the first, you'll find this one great, again, it's full of amazing actors and characters, a great sooundtrack and not only, but the problem is, they cared more about making a good conclusion joining the sequel a few things that happened in the first so they could strech the film to finish it with an unforgettable ending, instead of trying to make a sequel that it's so good as the original or even better, but well, it worked and I liked it, worth of an afternoon watch. 2 hours of thrills, fun and entertainment, I recommend it. By the way, one of Kill Bill: Volume 2's things that stands out is the buried alive scene, it's just so intense, thrilling and memorable. Great movie.\n\nQuentin Tarantino directed it and wrote it, again, he did a magnificent work with both things and even though this wasn't one of the best movies of his career, I do think his work with Kill Bill: Vol. 2 was memorable. Uma Thurman takes the lead, she was amazing, I loved her performance and her amazing performance was dignifying of a Golden Globe nomination, Uma is known from my thirteenth favorite movie, wich is Pulp Fiction, she is also known from Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Gattaca and some other movies. David Carradine (R.I.P) was amazing, I loved his performance that was worth of a deserved Golden Globe nomination, David is known from Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and some other movies. Michael Madsen was okay here, I liked his performance, Michael is known from Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Reservoir Dogs and some other movies. Daryl Hannah was good, her performance was satisfying, Daryl is known from Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Blade Runner, A Walk to Remember and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie has a great cast and it also has amazing performances, two amazing performances worth of two GG-noms. Great cast.\n\nThe murderous Bride continues her vengeance quest against her ex-boss, Bill, and his two remaining associates; his young brother Budd, and Bill's latest flame Elle.(What I thought about the plot) The plot was amazing, Quentin wrote an amazing follow-up to the very well written Volume 1, he brought new amazing characters and overall, he did a terrififc job. I loved the chapters, the last chapter (Face to Face) must have been very tough to come up with, cause it was just genius and I truly loved it and the connection of the scenes through scenes is just fantastic, by the way, the buried alive part and the fight at Budd's house is just genius, Quentin's writing was just spectacular and he conluded the script with very talent. Overall, this script was amazing and it did not only concluded the expected Volume as it also brought some of the things that happened before like the pregnancy, the wedding rehearsal right at the beginnig, etc. Sow, Kill Bill: Volume 2 wasn't my favorite sequel but it had one of the best scripts for a sequel, Tarantino did a magnificent job with the writing. Terrific plot.\n\nSoundtrack, well, the soundtrack (Again) was amazing, RZA did an amazing job and he fortunately used some of the original movie's themes. The action was fantastic, it was violent and intense and I loved it. There was sword fighting, samurai fighting, blood in the air, snakes, punches, kung fu technics, eye ripping and smashing, the action was honestly a bit too heavy and intense, but it was still pretty pleasunt and enjoyable and those action scenes are really the ones that represent Kill Bill. There wasn't any scenes like the \"Crazy 88s\" or a fight between The Bride and O-Ren but the action scenes were still pretty satisfying and solid. Problem: Attention, this is no kind of spoiler, so you can finish reading this paragraph, well, what's the name of this franchise? Kill Bill. What's the premise? A woman who wants to kill a man named Bill. Well, we expect to see something like that full of action and blood, but here, it surprisingly wasn't like that,t here was almost no slice of action, but I was satisfied and you just have to watch it to be aware of how amazingly Kill Bill: Vol. 2 finished.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, while we watched at the first movie, a woman killing a woman while she was preparing her daughter's cereals, here, we see something very diferent. I liked Kill Bill: Vol. 2, it was an action-packed movie with an amazing storyline, it had everything it needed, good performances, a good script, an amazing director, good action and a great storyline, they had all of that, but I'm just not sure why it didn't work so well, I think it had the potential to be an amazing sequel, but well, this movie even though it was great, it might have been cursed by the \"Sequel Curse\". Overall, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is a great but not amazing sequel, it has a great cast, amazing performances, a terrific directing, a terrific plot, a great soundtrack, amazing action scenes and it's (mostly) very entertaining. I recommend this movie, even if I considered it a bad movie, I would still think it's worth being watched, it's a conclusion, and it includes everything that you want to know. I liked it, but it's not nearly as good as the original. Kill Bill: Vol. 2: 7.0/10. Great.\n\nGreat movie. Very recommended movie. Grade: C+.",

As a character study, the film is fantastic, but I found it difficult to give a damn about any of the cardboard-stiff characters.

Uma Thurman cemented her mark in cinematic history as the vengeful bride with her outstanding Golden Globe nominated performance in these films. \n\nI praise Tarantino for his great screenplay and for telling the Kill Bill story as if it were a novel, via chapters and its non linear film structure at times. The cast is perfect and this film was very well handled and rather than being seen as a sequel or follow up it very much does feel like a second half to a really long film. Which is a great thing and gives the two part film another unique quality. All questions are answered, everything is rapped up quite nicely and the film does have more story but its action scenes and martial art combat is very well constructed in this film as well.
