    "summary": "In 1942, young Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) lands her dream job -- secretary to Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) at the peak of his power. Three years later, Hitler's empire is now his underground bunker. The real-life Traudl narrates Hitler's final days as he rages against imagined betrayers and barks orders to phantom armies, while his mistress, Eva Braun (Juliane K\u00f6hler), clucks over his emotional distance, and other infamous Nazis prepare for the end.",

            "content": "A movie that's become more well-known nowadays for its many parodies with mock subtitles, some might understandably find Downfall hard to take seriously. But surprisingly, once you find out what Hitler's really so outraged about, Der Untergang ends up becoming a compelling (if very dark and tear-inducing) WWII-set drama thanks to its remarkable performances with the late Bruno Ganz doing a successful job humanising an apparently historically accurate (yes, even his hammy outbursts) version of one of the most evil men of the last century, Oliver Hirschbiegel's outstanding work directing the film and this upsetting atmosphere of doom and gloom as Germany is now set to be taken over by the Soviets even as this monster finds himself in...I'm going to make an educated guess and say three out of five stages of grief over his crumbling empire. Even as somebody who saw the parodies first and then understood what they meant in context, Hitler could be rather terrifying when he's angry even as I have to hold some laughter in over bald Nazi Jodl getting on his nerves during one of his plans. Who'd have thought that Fegelein, for how much of a memetic badass he is in the parodies (and played by the actor who's had the strongest post-Downfall career; hell, even in 2004 he was already in a prominent Hollywood production), isn't even that big of a presence in the finished film? He's not even important to Hitler in the grand scheme of things! He was just a \"next best thing\" after his boss Himmler surrendered to the Allies (and now you know why Hitler's enthusiasm dampened after he was having a nice dinner and having a conversation about strong and weak). Did I mention his secretary, whom we barely see in the parodies, ends up taking over as the protagonist once that tall Nazi who was in a James Bond film before becoming known as \"stupid giant\" informs his fellow comrades the bad news about their beloved F\u00fchrer once he commits suicide (I can only imagine some idiot condemning me for being uncharacteristically spoileriffic when even people who don't know much about WWII beyond \"the bad guys were led by a man with a silly moustache\" know it ends with him shooting himself and his wife)? Yep, once you get it together and have the real subtitles bring you back down to Earth, Downfall is a dark, depressing but well-acted, incredibly directed film about Hitler during the last 10 days of the Second World War that reminds us that, no matter how appalling our actions and goals might be, we're all human at the end of the day making Der Untergang one of the greatest historical dramas of all time.",

This film is very powerful with incredible visuals of World War 2 that are visceral and vivid. The film brings this historical event to life in an effective and accurate way. The movie does not rely much on acting but on the drama of the fall of Berlin and the Third Reich. But is legendary German actor Bruno Gantz who pulls an incredible performance as Adolf Hitler that makes this movie so effective. Bruno becomes Hitler with his extreme swing moods of calmness and sweetness and then his outbursts of insane hysteria. Although the characters are not always fleshed out and requires historical knowledge this film is a powerful drama of the tragedy that was Nazi Germany.",

            "content": "\"Downfall\" is a majestic historical film, which is not only historically accurate, but also gets the viewer to actually be interested in a plot. It tells a story about Hitler and the Third Reich's elite in the last days of war, which is why this movie is so unique, as it opens out a story that not many could even have enough bravery to do. The characters are perfect, as well as the entire movie is nearly fully built on dialogue, which is why I am so surprised I loved it so much. This is Bruno Ganz's most iconic role, as he doesn't just play Hitler, he is literally Hitler in this movie. You believe every single word he says, the intonation of every single phrase and his facial expressions make him look like actual Hitler, not some budget fake one. The movie also perfectly shows how hard was it for Nazi Germans to admit that they have lost, that they were ready to fight for their ideals until the end, no matter how horrifying those ideas were. A viewer is introduced to Victory Day from a different perspective. People trying to end their lives, as well as their closest family members' live just so that none of them go in the hands of enemies they have fought that long. Emotionally the movie is fantabulous. Emotions is what made Hitler's screaming speech so iconic, even made it into a meme, which actually brought me to this movie and I am very happy it did. The decorations and the overall spectrum of colors in the movie is very accurate and makes you almost feel like if you are watching an actual war tape. The fact, that USSR soldiers are the ones, that are capitulating Berlin and are the scariest force is also brilliant, as many of other war films nearly started to forget who had the most sacrifices. \"Der Untergang\" is the best German movie I have ever seen and is a perfect film for those who adore history or for those who love strong acting. A must-watch historical drama, 10/10.",

It is a gripping film and does a fantastic job of capturing the last days of the Third Reich. Some have criticized the film for not painting Hitler as the caricature so often seen in other films. Bruno Ganz's nuanced performance reveals a man capable of basic civilities and genuine tenderness who also was prone to unhinged rants, delusions of grandeur, bottomless hatred of entire races, and stunning indifference to the fates of those he dragged down with him. Ganz is mesmerizing, which is fitting as he is portraying a man who so mesmerized those around him that many begged to be allowed the \"honor\" of dying with him. The script leaves no doubt about the evil nature of the man and his regime and does so in a way perfectly consistent with their motivations and worldviews. The performances and script craft a narrative that is much more powerful than any caricature.",

Some scenes stretch this, the normalcy of doing a good job in a bad situation not of your making, seeming overly apologetic, but never reaching forgivable. The main character, the secretary interviewed in real life decades later is the weak point, leaving me wondering if anything was learned or truly felt as horror, immoral choices, or if what I'm seeing is the regret of being so close to the a losing side. The makers probably aimed for ambivalence, the result is just lack of focus. Watch, think, probably judge, maybe walk away with none of that, but this one will definitely leave you wondering.",

This movie feels like it pays attention to the little details and moments and is a gripping account of Adolf Hitler's final days. A big part of the movie that works is Bruno Ganz's lead performance. Every second he was on screen I felt the intensity of his presence and genuinely was afraid of how he was going to react to inevitably bad news. The movie isn't as heavily dramatized as other historical movies, and at times it can feel slower because of it. However, I think the end result is worth it and the movie ends up leaving a considerable emotional impact because of how real it feels. I think if you're a history buff, this is the perfect movie for you, but even if you feel like WWII has been overdone, there is a lot to admire here.",

Most of the acting performances are fantastic, though Bruno Ganz could be too over-the-top in certain patches.

Downfall thoughtfully portrays how the German command fell apart as Hitler did not care about the German civilians and stopped giving out orders that made any tactical sense. It's a fascinating film that is very informative about a very specific time and place, while also being very entertaining with astute acting performances from a talented German cast.\n\nBruno Ganz is obviously the reason to watch Downfall as his depiction of Adolf Hitler is the most accurate and menacing available in any film thus far. Ganz, rest in peace, was already an acting legend after starring in Wings of Desire and recently passed after starring in Lars von Trier's The House That Jack Built, so it is very cool to see him in rare form as the heinous dictator Hitler. His ranting and muttering is supremely entertaining and haunting to see a man so vile and full of hate.\n\nDirector Oliver Hirschbiegel is remarkable in his matter of fact style that looks almost like a documentary showing the events as they play out. His direction is pretty riveting considering Downfall is 156 minutes long and I was never bored. He balances strategic war planning, field combat, and character development very nicely considering how much he has to inform audiences about in one movie. I hope he continues to direct films after Downfall as he's a clear directorial talent.\n\nThe entire German supporting cast is outstanding and very realistic. At times, I felt like I was just watching everything happen for real. Hans Funck's editing is very solid and engaging without too many cuts. Rainer Klausmann's cinematography features handheld wide shots and rigid close-ups for revealing personal moments. Stephan Zacharias' score is intensely dark and fits the tone of Downfall.\n\nTo summarize, Downfall's magnificent lead role from Bruno Ganz elevates Oliver Hirschbiegel's professional direction and storytelling.",

            "content": "A film that once took the internet by storm, with endless memes and dubbed videos of the bunker scene, I was interested in seeing what all the furor was about. Downfall is a film that attempts to capture the final days of the holocaust and Adolf Hitler before his suicide. The film mainly focuses on his realistic character, his few last encounters and calls to war in his underground bunker surrounded by his wife, dog, and loyal servants.\nOne of the most interesting themes portrayed in this film is the trauma of the perpetrator as seen through the humanization of Hitler's character. What this essentially and chillingly does, is put a face to the Holocaust, the biggest genocide in human history. The reason this is so chilling is, throughout the film, Adolf seems to be almost normal and frighteningly relatable. He is portrayed in an incredibly fatherly manner, even referring to his young secretary as \"Child\". He even pinches a young boy's cheek in a very fatherly and prideful manner after learning that he had blown up two tanks. Hitler, in a way, has a split personality -- the man and father figure to those around him and, Fuhrer, the leader of Nazi Germany. His relationship with his secretary humanizes him through his playful behavior with her even looking up to and growing attached to him. His figure is also humanized through many means such as his close relationship with his dog, who he puts to sleep at the end of the film before his own 'noble' suicide and also showing the dog as part of his family not letting people in the bunker, being a vegetarian, etc.\nThis film also shows the important role ideologies play in people's day-to-day lives such as the social pressure when Madga poisons her children where she says, \"I won't let the children grow up in a world with no national socialism,\" and adding, \"If the idea of national socialism dies, there is no future.\" Her views show how deeply embedded these beliefs and ideologies are, and how self-surveillance and validation is created by giving individuals a sense of purpose through subscription to these ideologies. This film also portrays the Nazi's as dying for a good cause or for the belief that they are serving their country and doing the best for its people, Hitler reaffirms this belief by saying that he \u2018cleansed the German lands of Jewish poison.' This showcases the trauma of the perpetrator; while the Germans continue to go out and kill they are also portrayed as being hurt and scared (small children, families, women, etc.).\nDownfall raises bigger questions such as how human-like should we attempt to portray characters when capturing the image of a monster of unspeakable actions such as Adolf Hitler? Should biographers even attempt to make him seem human or capture him in way that people might sympathize? \nThe spread of the bunker scene and how it went viral shows how Hitler can, in some senses, become fetishized as a source of entertainment. This concludingly makes light of the entire situation and allows for the capitalization and commodification of disaster, in this case, genocide. In this case, is absence of representation better than poor representation? If it is unethical to make a fictional movie about the Holocaust in memory of it and to document the event, should only documentaries be made? When a documentary is made, there is always the risk that it belittles the event or disaster to something that is not, or attempts to put a cap on how big or small or pain an event or disaster truly have. A documentary does more damage as it claims to be of greater truth than a regular fictional film, so in this sense, it constricts the lens through which the event could be imagined even further. This also raises the question of in the case of representation, who has the right to represent?",

            "content": "Yesterday. The 16th of April. Exactly 75 years ago. On the anniversary of this historic battle that ended the war in Europe. I re watched Downfall. \nThe battle for Berlin started at Seelow Hights. It was the beginning of the end for Hitler and the 3rd Reich. This film shows the last few days of the 3rd Reich from the perspective of Trudl Junge. Hitler's personal secretary. \n\nI cant began to tell you how magnificent this film is. Everything about it is fantastic. It's a historical film done right. The acting and casting is superb. Bruno Ganz is a fantastic actor. And he always has been as far as I know. He IS Adolf Hitler. And his performance will likely never be surpassed. It is legendary. And it's historically accurate too. All the other actors do such a great job too. The extras are even good. The wardrobe designer did a brilliant job working with uniform experts to get everything correct. Hitler's ranting and raving sounds so real. The tight-in camera positions make it feel like you are actually in the bunker with them, peering over the shoulder of a General to see Hitler doing his thing.  The screenwriter has done his homework. The dialogue is very good. It's not a biased film in any respect, in my opinion. It portrays everything as it happened. The concern for German civilians expressed by SS-brigadef\u00fchrur Monk\u00e8 is true. And it shows this. As the disagreement between Speer and Hitler. The pyrotechnics are convincing and the sound design is realistic. There is no extra lighting used. This also adds to the realism. It's not a set. Its tight in. Using the actual light sources they would have used back then is a good choice. \"Keep it real\" as Ali G would say. \n\nThe tragedy of the casualties of war is quite emotional here in this picture. Especially the use of the Hitler youth as child soldiers. Its quite disturbing. Goebbels killing their children is heartbreaking. Showing the human side to the monsters is an important and potent way to grip the audience. And it's also the most authentic. The atrocities that took place happened on both sides. \n\nOne of the scenes that I remember is when Hitler is just sitting, staring at his famous portrait of Frederick the Great. Almost as if, hoping for some Divine inspiration from him. Obviously there is also the one scene that everyone thinks of when talking about this film. The \"Hitler rants\" scene. Probably the peak of bruno Ganz' professional career. And very well deserved. Likely one most memorable scene of the film.\n\nThe musical score for this picture matches perfectly with the scenery and the overall feeling and tone of the picture. \n\nAll in all, it's a must see. It's a portrayal of Hitler like no other. Better then any other. And as for the others, them too. Speer looks and sounds just like how he really was in real life, Himmler, Hewel, Gunche, ect.. Everyone who worked on this motion picture, I commend. A fantastic must see.\n\n\"Fegelein! Fegelein! Fegelein!\"",

            "content": "One of the most striking portraits of societal collapse ever put to film. Seeing Hitler's weakness gradually manifest itself in a more profound manner as options fail him may make some cry foul for implying that he had any degree of humanity rather than reiterating that he was simply a psychopath, but that is where the horror lies: Hitler and his cohort were not without emotion. Instead, the broad range of characters and their associated reactions to being gradually cornered in a claustrophobic bunker reveal a frightful diversity: some frantically committed without thought of self-preservation, some ladder-climbers, some keeping their heads down and others simply apathetic. But this range of personalities still managed to support one of the most horrific regimes in history, only finally coming undone when circumstances virtually prohibited its continuation in any form. Well-acted, particularly Ganz in such a challenging and stigmatized role. (4/5)",

The rest of the cast play the array of sycophants and loyal lunatics. This is history, a warning, a film all rolled into one.",

The natural state of humanity is to care for each other as people and as individuals. Nazism is unnatural. Nazism tells us that we must pray to the altar of some sort of mysterious racial presence while throwing the individuals that comprise said presence under a bridge, typically one made of bullets. This conflict: between the Nazi Party and the Nazis in the Party, can be felt hiding under floorboards and held within closed mouths and yet rumbling strongly under the surface, like a coming earthquake. And thus, the film shows the National Socialists as people. It does not dehumanize them, it does not try to comprehend them or simplify what's complex; the filmmakers are above using Nazi tactics.",

The acting is magnificent, all around. Bruno Ganz's performance as Adolf Hitler has to be the greatest performance not to be win the Oscar. His portrayal of Hitler in no way glorifies the man. It reveals a man who could be very nice and indeed affectionate to his close staff and yet was completely lacking in empathy for his fellow Germans and full of hate for so many others. \nRead Anthony Beevor's magnificent Berlin: The Downfall. It will allow you to appreciate the realism of this magnificent film even more. I have watched this many times and will watch it many more.",

Despite losing the Oscar for Best Foreign Film, at least this film gave us Hitler memes. Overall, Downfall brought the realism of war into a reality.",
