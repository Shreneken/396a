Amazing acting by everyone , SRK is so natural and so  perfect for this role that you can't imagine anyone doing Mohan Bhragava . Music and lyrics are two strong pillars , it's not a beauty but it adds to the meaning and message the movie wants to convey . On the top of everything and needless to say Mr Ashutosh is just mind blowing and perfect like a diamond . Hats off the team \nLoved this inspiring peace of work .",

This was actually the first ever film that made me cry with its beautiful script and screenplay. Ashutosh Gowariker's on his way for a nice hat trick for movies. Another thing I loved was the songs and the music.  \nAgain, how is this from 2004?! I can't explain how amazing this film is in words.\nSRK's amazing emotions and acting gave a picture to the film and A.R Rahman's music gave it sound.",

It's a patriotic movie based on Indian mindsets and our culture. Targeting problems and issues aced Indian rural. This movie best of its kind and every teenager must watch it. To remember what we have become, from where we come and where we have to go. Role of our culture, ideas, beliefs and the feeling of patriotic, which we have from the second we born. I can say that the movie is too long for us, who can't concentrate for more than an hour, but it is a reminder that rather than working for someone else, we can make a change in society by giving it some time. I salute to the story writer who with the help of this story motivated Indians to work for the society and make the change.\nHats off the team Loved this inspiring peace of work .",

The depth in the story could have been better. The character was well brought out by SRK but at the end of the day, I don't think he could shed his SRK-ness in the movie. There was a lot of heart in the movie and that's good. There were good images of countryside and celebration of what India stands for in subtle messages comprising of the best parts of the movie.",

But it's slightly too conventional and over-plodding at three hours and an extra thirty minutes which needs just too much of the patience, which I don't think Bollywood has to reward the film with cherished box office numbers. \"Lagaan\", despite being way more long, was a more terrific and original film. It's trimming too is slightly problematic. But to feel that an Indian director has made such an important story is winsome and great, and that makes \"Swades\" worth the price of your ticket. It's not perfect, but it'll be generous to say that it's not far from it either.",

The lead actor Shah Rukh Khan is a big star in India but here he plays it subtle which is what the performance desires. Gayatri Joshi doesn't have much to do but she is ravishing. This is one of the rare Bollywood films that makes one sit and ponder.(Great Bollywood film worth a watch).",

I find this to be on par or even better than Lagaan. It's well acted and is a well balanced drama even though a few songs seems unnecessary. I also feel extremely attracted towards lead actress Gayathri Joshi. Shahrukh Khan gives another great performance. The film must be praised for depicting India in a realistic manner without an over flow of unnecessary patriotism. Also the protagonists' view of India and the reasons for it's lack of growth and accurate and never been shown so vividly in any film before.",

Director, Ashutosh Gowarikar's patriotism and dedication towards the country can be clearly seen in this movie. The way he directed this movie is just outstanding. Every emotion, every theme is handled with perfection. Shah Rukh Khan is the heart of the movie. His acting is genuine and the performances like this are the reason why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors this country ever had. Swades is a celebration of a different kind of patriotism, which is more realistic, more believable and holds strong even today.",

Ashutosh Gowariker just delivers patriotism even through silence, such is his expertise in invoking the right doctrines in the right scenes which move every Indian emotionally. Swades is beyond the basic definition of movie, it is a combination of strong perception on society  with smooth presentation through entertainment. The screenplay is so precisely written being successful in a constant development of emotional, romantic and revolutionary perspectives parallely ,yet completely. Cinematography sublimely has a purity in itself creating the native Indian environment  effectively. A R Rahman's music is the heartbeat of the movie, such a great re-recording is rarely seen which not only sounds good but tells the story through sound.The character of Mohan Bhargava is so well written and weaved into the script that one can say that Swades is \"Gandhi\"s equal and ashutosh equals Richard Attenborough.",

In the tryst of this journey, the true story enraptures with the realization of the very facts ad grass root realism about India.
