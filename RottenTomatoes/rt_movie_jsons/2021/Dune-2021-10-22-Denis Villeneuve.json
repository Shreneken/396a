The storyline was due to his huge range in topics and events difficult to understand and to follow. To clear things up, I personally recommend reading the books. They give you a lot of background information about the events that are not fully explained or not showed detailed enough in the film. Nevertheless, itâ€˜s interesting and has a lot of aspects, which are not fully linked to each other, making you curious what will happen next. The actors played the roles really well. \n\nI would definitely recommend watching the movie and itâ€˜ s a must-see for all science fiction lovers (including me). I am giving the well deserved 4.5 out of 5 stars. Well done! :D",

            "content": "3.5 stars:   Dune is a classic science fiction story told in an almost biblical fashion. It is the story of warring kingdoms, and the hope of the coming Chosen One. There were some great special effects to represent a different type of technology.\n\nThe biggest problem the film had was that it just took too long to tell the story \n(two and a half hours). On top of that the plot itself was very slow moving in order to remain true to the story. There are many complicated characters to feature. I actually watched the film in two. hour and 15 minute sittings.  That seemed to help me maintain focus.-",

            "content": "A very slow and tedious watch. It seemed like they were trying to see how many long desert pans they could fit into a single movie. The characters don't have much emotion in their acting, so it's hard to feel invested when not even the characters seem that invested in their own story. \nAlso, the sound mixing has major issues. It's very difficult to hear what the characters are saying with them mumbling in monotone all the time.\nAt least the plot is somewhat interesting, but it's difficult to follow and moves at a snail's pace. It's hard to follow at times and gives off the same feeling as if you're walking in on the eighth episode of a TV show with no prior knowledge. It's probably most enjoyable to the people who have been long time fans of the original Dune (which I prefer).",
