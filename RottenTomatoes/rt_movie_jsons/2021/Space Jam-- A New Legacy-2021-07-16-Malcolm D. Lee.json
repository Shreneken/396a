    "summary": "When LeBron James and his young son Dom are trapped in a digital space by a rogue A.I., LeBron must get them home safe by leading Bugs, Lola Bunny and the whole gang of notoriously undisciplined Looney Tunes to victory over the A.I.'s digitized champions on the court: a powered-up roster of professional basketball stars as you've never seen them before. It's Tunes versus Goons in the highest-stakes challenge of his life, that will redefine LeBron's bond with his son and shine a light on the power of being yourself.",

I loved the concept of them playing a video game version of basketball to allow for all the style points and such, but the whole Al G Rhythm was just dumb. I still don't really understand what the villain's motivation was. LeBron James can't act, and that's OK. I wouldn't have expected him to, but I thought Michael Jordan's performance worked better for two reasons: 1) a simpler plot, and 2) he didn't try to over act. \n\nJust...too much of it didn't work. The villain's main player who could stop time. When he, himself, could reverse time? Um, why doesn't he just keep doing that? And he controls everything, why does he have to stick to his bargain? He cheats throughout anyway? Just doesn't work. But it was fun, I guess. The first one was better.",

BUT YEAH THIS MOVIE IS GREAT AND I WOULD SELL MY LEFT heart TO watch it for the first time again. I cam forever grateful for my eyes for letting watch this movie. I love you Lebron and I know u love me and miss me (this is Lebrun's son). Just so you know im very happy that this movie has been made I would never not watch it even to save the world. you would think there would be a word limit on this review but google knows anyone could praise this movie for hours on end and they cannot limit their happy fans. please give LeBron and bugs bunny an Oscar or Tony or whatever award they give to actors. I love you Hebron (dad). ur cool. - OCSAR",

This new iteration of the 90's nostalgia cannon featuring Michael Jordan lacks all the original's wit and charm. Instead, it chooses to substitute those elements with product placement and IP crossover elements that cheapen the film immensely while doing a lousy job of distracting from how poor the plot elements are throughout the film's much too long runtime. The entire film seems like one big, self-initiated pat on the back for Warner Brothers as they finally find a way to cash in on their every property simultaneously. It didn't work for Spielberg in Ready Player One, it certainly doesn't pay off for director Malcolm D. Lee either. It's also a self-indulgent showcase for Lebron James, who's acting is atrocious throughout, in a way that it never was for Jordan. The whole thing winds up feeling more than a little masturbatory. It's a love note written to Lebron James and Warner Brothers, written by Lebron James and Warner Brothers, and featuring Lebron James and Warner Brothers.",

It wasn't something fresh and new it was just like a copy. Also the references to the other movies and cartoons were fun to see in the background and also spot and recognize. The jokes were funny but my personal favorite is the Michel Jordan/Michel B. Jordan.

            "content": "LeBron James worked hard to be the greatest and he's not about to let his son Dom be a slacker. Instead of basketball, Dom only wants to be a video game designer. WB's new computer algorithm Al G. Rhythm (Don Cheadle) wants to use LeBron's popularity to dominate the social media space. After LeBron rejects the offer, Al G. Rhythm kidnaps LeBron and Dom into the computer world. LeBron has to play a basketball game to win freedom for himself and his son. LeBron is sent to Tune World where he finds a lonely Bugs Bunny.\n\nLeBron is a functional actor and I like the older style Looney Tunes cartoon world. I love the Michael B. Jordan bit. I like some bits in this movie but it's way too long and too much of this is below par. The best part of this movie is Bugs Bunny in his Looney Tunes world and then they go off to various franchises to search for the rest of his friends. I like all of that. I like the animation style. Quite frankly, an animated LeBron James allows him off the hook for his acting. His voice is unique and works well for animation. Turning him in cartoon is a good thing. He doesn't have to act. He should stay a cartoon until he wins the game.\n\nHis son Dom is a big problem. He's a brat. The excuse is that he gets enticed by Al G. Rhythm but it's a sorry excuse. At no point is he concerned about being in a computer simulation or about his father. The solution lies in Al turning Dom into a monster. When LeBron has his big emotional speech, Dom can slowly turn back into a boy looking to hug his father. That is much better characterization and progression in his story arc.\n\nFinally, this movie is hella busy and way too long. It is almost two hours long. The game is almost an hour long. They need to cut out at least fifteen minutes if not more. There is so much chaotic action that the long game section grows tiresome. People are excusing this for being a kids movie. Some of these references are going right over those kids' heads. They are not going to get A Clockwork Orange. For people who get all the references, this is bad for them. For kids who don't get the references, there's no point to it. This movie has fun bits. I love the Looney Tunes animation section. I don't like them digitized into computer animated. The plot is bad simplistic writing. The father son conflict could have been done better. This is way too long and that pushed me over the edge.",

The flashy, almost psychedelic visuals can be over the top though. The plot is simple with a moral lesson about family relationship and acceptance. The Looney Tunes characters are funnier here than in the first movie. They were also given an upgrade from 2D to 3D animation in the latter part of the movie. Some people might not like Warner Brothers' shameless branding, but I love how they featured some of their most well-loved movie characters from different fandoms. As expected, the basketball games were wacky and hilarious. It's understandable that LeBron James' acting was bland because he's not really an actor. But Don Cheadle was terrific as the main villain. I also like how they included Sonequa Martin-Green from The Walking Dead, because she's a fine actress. This sequel may not be as innovative as its predecessor, but for me, it's funnier and the visuals are way better. I think kids and LeBron's fans will enjoy it the most.",

This, above all else, feels like a motion billboard for HBO Max with a runtime that overstays its welcome by about a half-hour.\n\nWarner Bros seems to have used this as an opportunity to chase what makes Fortnite a fun experience but by being entirely hands-off it takes away from what gives that game its sandbox magic. Added to that, the story in Space Jam: A New Legacy is straight up Hook. A villainous character kidnaps the child of its adversary and pretends to support their interests to turn them against their father. LeBron James is Peter Pan and Bugs Bunny is Rufio.\n\nIt's not entirely surprising, considering both the director and cinematographer left due to creative differences with the studio after filming had already begun - one could assume they wanted to be creative - and roughly thirty people ended up touching the script. Another case of \"too many cooks,\" it's so over-saturated that it became bland. Mixing every color of paint will end up neutral no matter how much heavily contrasted neon accents it.\n\nGratuitous background usage of Hollywood Boulevard-esque takes on characters when you're inside of WB's IP universe is one thing but who are some of these old gag references for? Why is there a U Can't Touch this break? Was that from a draft of the Tony Hawk or Jackie Chan sequels that never came to fruition almost thirty years ago?\n\nI do appreciate the Friday Night Lights reference, so props to that, but I'm also thirty-six.\n\nLooney Tunes has a history of referencing older media but what's happened here is more like Family Guy's \"This reminds me of...\" breakouts rather than reverence and homage to things that, at one point, were contemporaries of Looney Tunes. Their brand-loyalty was also self-aware, making fun of themselves instead of looking at the WB water tower and placing their hand over their hearts, which is how I saw the characters in this movie.\n\nSpace Jam: A New Legacy could have successfully tapped into nostalgia with sincerity and heart but its rehashed and half-hearted story, off-the-mark references, and gluttony of \"Hey look at this show! And this movie!\" end up resulting in more of a brick than a slam dunk.",

He never built himself up, gave respect to his teammates and fans, and never actes like he was anything other than a player in a team. Unlike LeBron.. James is a joke. Couldn't act to save his life. Arrogant. Egotistical.Over paid joke. It's said to think this generation of kids have such a bomb to call theirs, but atleast they can re watch the better original.",

It worked for about 30 minutes, but then I learned that I was supposed to keep the car engine running or else the a/c would kill my battery. The car died and managed to play sound out of the radio for about 10 more minutes before we were stuck listening to the last ~hour of the movie through a distant speaker while we sweat in the car and the kid became fussy. Granted, I had went into this expecting a brisk experience since the first Space Jam had came in under 90 minutes; I didn't know this was almost 2 hours long when we started. Anyway, Bron's acting was no better than Jordan's was but there was a lot more obfuscation available with the improvements in animation over the last 25 years. There was far less comedy and I didn't like any of the videogame aspect at all; they treated this like a remake rather than a sequel, but didn't respect the original enough to realize what had worked well the first time. It wasn't a complete waste of time, and it wasn't the worst sequel to a beloved original I've seen (that would be Zoolander 2), but the room for improvement was massive here.",

And indeed, I already knew that I would not see the new Zootopia.\nBut if there is one thing that has kept me away from the film until then, besides the Italian language, it is the bad reviews given to the film. And after having seen it in the original language, I will tell you, many are absolutely justified.\nThe film features a MASSIVE presentation of the brands held by Warner in sometimes suffocating and blatantly propagandistic quantities. It is not that I did not appreciate the cameos, for heaven's sake, but they are just cameos without real substance and usefulness.\nSpeaking instead of the plot, it is in fact the first space Jam, with only small tricks such as the fact that this time it is the ptotagonist who is looking for the Looney Tunes and not vice versa. Tricks, however, that give more meaning to the plot. But let's not deny that the father-son relationship is one of the most predictable and clich\u00e9d things I've ever seen in similar contexts: there is no outlet for originality or deviation. Moreover, the near-death of Bugs does not work, since we are talking about immortal brands.\nThe acting skills leave a lot to be desired: LeBron is clearly seen that he is not an actor and his expressions are plastic.\nThe jokes are funny, but only in part: some are based on pop culture that has already aged or will soon get old.\nBut now let's move on to the more positive sides of the film: the animations are spectacular and brilliantly mix live action, 2D animation and CGI. I also have to say that I really admire the Looney Tunes design in CGI and honestly I would have liked to see them more like that.\nThe references in the middle are great and for the most part funny.\nMy take on this film is almost identical to Sherlock Gnomes: both are undoubtedly bad films, but they have redeeming qualities that make for decent experiences.\nIn general, the film has poor writing, acting skills that define skill is overkill, and a noticeable cash back on Warner products\nBUT\nnevertheless, it is fun and the animations are among the best seen in recent years.\nIf you are a fan of the former, you will surely love it. And that was all Warner cared about.\nWith top animations but mundane and weak story, Space Jam: A New Legacy is okay",

The soundtrack of the movie is insanely good, pulling you into the movie, setting the correct mood, and overall just being a collection of really good songs I could not help but have on repeat weeks after watching the movie. Considering who the main cast consists of, its inevitable that there's a few not-so-well acted scenes, but those take up barely any time compared to a lot of the other really good scenes. The humor is also great! I died of laughter, and could still list them out laughing if I weren't trying to keep this review spoiler-free. Overall, go watch it! You, your kids, your family, your friends- it's great for all!",

As far as the movie goes, it feels forced and takes itself too seriously, which makes it a bore to watch.

Even though the opening credits is the best part, \ud835\ude1a\ud835\ude31\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude11\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2e: \ud835\ude08 \ud835\ude15\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude38 \ud835\ude13\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude3a isn't that bad, and is actually quite fun if you don't take it seriously.",

Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Toons have none of the wit and humor that made them a childhood favorite.

The plot is structured around classic familial themes and leans heavily on a \"video game\" premise to cater to the smart-phone generation. However it's also disturbingly obsessed with flaunting WB's many owned IP's.\n\nI don't know if drowning the audience in referential humor and cameos was the way to go but I guess you can argue WB literally is the only company that has the right to do it, so why not?\n\nA lot of reviewers argue it diminishes and pushes back the Loony Tunes cast but if you actually watch the film it's pretty obvious they don't. Bugs and friends are constantly asserting their personality and putting their own whacky or zany context on other IPs. I would even argue they play a bigger role than the original where Roadrunner didn't even get screen time on the court.\n\nI think the only huge missed opportunity of the project was not making Bill Murray the main antagonist (Al-G Rhythm), that would've been golden.\n\nSpace Jam: A New Legacy is good enough, it's visually engaging (classic 2D animation is great and the 3D is up to industry standards), the story is a serviceable family themed narrative and it's at least interesting to see the Loony Tunes cast trounce around in the world of WB owned IPs.",

I would say if you have some extra change and you have a while to spare its worth a watch but don't go out of your way to see it.",

I was only six, and hadn't had the pleasure of seeing Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). Somewhat shamefully, I still haven't. But Space Jam was lunacy at its best, using Michael Jordan at the height of his powers to launch a film alongside the Looney Tunes. So why the need for a sequel twenty five years on? Well, twenty minutes into Space Jam: A New Legacy, the answer is obvious. \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 for Warner Brothers. It may as well be called Warner Brothers: A New Legacy. It's a two hour advert for the company. LeBron James is the NBA star at the centre of it, and to be fair to him he does a perfectly fine job as the star, losing his son to baddie Don Cheadle inside the 'serververse' inside WB studio headquarters. Mad enough for you yet? At almost two hours, SJ2 is way too long, considering the attention span of the age group it's mainly aimed at, and it takes around twenty minutes to see a Tune on screen. Thankfully, once the Tunes are introduced, the film does pick up, it's fun just to see them on screen and some of them remain as amusing as ever. As we travel through various WB worlds to track down some of the tunes, including Matrix world, Harry Potter world, Metropolis (yes, really) one begs the question are Warner Brothers on the brink of some horrific collapse we don't know about? Or is it just crass commercialism of the highest order? We all know the answer. For the kids there is plenty to enjoy; presumably the plot that centres around a video game designed by James' son is to attract the millions of youngsters who spend all their free time glued to screens. But I did laugh several times; there's an excellent gag involving Michael Jordan towards the end that makes it almost worth it, and LeBron James certainly convinces you that he cares for his family, and that the reason behind all the mayhem is family. I believed that in a way you simply don't when Vin Diesel tries to persuade you of the same thing in the Fast & Furious films (that I'm a big fan of I might add). So it's pointless, it's crass almost beyond belief in its monetary ambitions, but there's enough in it that held both mine and my three year olds attention for two hours. Just.",

If I were a kid, I'm sure I'd enjoy it a lot (despite the fact there are a lot, and I mean A LOT of cameos and references kids today won't get but will keep adults trying to identify every character in the background). It has very good 2D and 3D animation and that's enough to entertain any kid. Also it's great this film pays tribute to the golden age of traditional animation.\nWe, animation fans, will never get a movie as good as Who framed Roger Rabbit again, or at least we haven't in all these years, but watching Bugs and friends on the big screen takes me back to my childhood every time. On the other hand, I agree this is like a big ad for Lebron, but I don't care that much, I guess It could have been any basketball player, we all know no one could fill Michael Jordan shoes in this one. I'm no critic, but as a final consumer let me tell you this is a very enjoyable kids movie.",

It's funny, most importantly pertaining, and it respects the Looney Tunes brand by featuring an ACTUAL cartoon segment of the film that feels like Looney Tunes! It's definitely still got problems, but I still enjoyed it even at two hours. It's more for adults than kids with it's referential humor though. It's a surreal see-it-to-believe-it situation.

The looney tunes stuff mostly worked. Lebron struggled but it was hard to tell whether it was a lack of acting talent (he has been fine in minor roles in the past) or the fact the screenplay makes him mostly a pill for most of the film.  The movie fails to use the idea of the Warnervese well (except for the crowd at the big game) and I think pulling from that IP catalog would have worked better for the goon squad (II) than what they ended up with animal/nba hybrids.  The film is super flashy (and those with epilepsy should avoid it).  For me it was a 2 1/2 out of 5 but my kids would rate it slightly higher. I would note that really young kids (under 4) were struggling in the theater and the film seems aimed slightly older.",
