I have nothing against anime and I went in with low expectations, but the movie still disappointed me and was painful to get through, at least until the climax. While the animation was impressive, it's not significantly better than many other high-quality animes and pre-CGI American animations. And while the final fight was somewhat cool (although definitely overrated), it doesn't make up for an hour and a half of nonsensical fighting where the main protagonist has loads of plot armor, pointless monologuing that adds nothing to the plot and only states the obvious, and terrible jokes and visual gags that were some of the most cringe-worthy I've ever heard or seen. Bundle this all up in a plot that makes no sense and is all over the place, and you've got yourself a terrible movie. Also, if you want to watch this dubbed, the voice acting is terrible, but I'm not marking the movie down for that since it was originally meant to be watched in Japanese and most anime dubs suck anyway. If you can appreciate this movie for the animation alone, it might be worth a watch, but if you mainly care about characters and plot, I'd definitely give this a hard pass.",

This movie was absolutely amazing the character all went through a lot of hardship in this movie and story was so well thought out and emotional. Mugen Train had me on edge at every moment  from the fight scene on the train to the final fight between Akaza and Rengoku. Each fight had so much emotion that it had you feeling for these characters. Tanjiro's outburst at the end was so powerful for me at the sight of an almost dead Rengoku. Regarding the animation, it was beautiful. Everything was so beautifully animated with the character models, scenery, and all the dark but also vibrant colors in every scene. The action was fast paced but slow enough to know what's going on. Overall I loved this movie and if I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.",

A trilha sonora é ótima e coloca o peso da cena na medida certa, os alívios cômicos ainda são um ponto a parte para se acertar o timing, mas nada que estrague a trama.

Both of those are key if you want your film to feel like it's stepping things up. That being said, even though it may not be great, it's certainly not bad, either. Picking up right where we left off, the quality throughout is consistent with the first season: that means the story remains engaging and the animation is still better than most which makes fight scenes very fun to watch. There are two things, however, that really push ‘Mugen Train' into above average territory: 1) the ability to spend two hours building up a new character and presenting his backstory, something that proves important when it comes to how much of an impact the ending has; 2) the animation and directing during the final fight. These two things combined make for a finale that is epic, satisfying, and moving in equal measure.",

The first half of the movie is watchable but first 30 minutes I felt like sleeping. In the second half of the movie yes animation was good and the fight was good but since this movie is canon to the anime story-wise it's horrible. There was 0 background knowledge on what or who the demon that showed up was in the anime or the movie so that was completely random. They fight for a bit and then he dies. There was close to 0 connection to Rengoku from the anime since he was only shown for like 3 episodes and nothing big happened in those episodes with him. I understand how people can be sad for him and think that fights were good but I care for the bigger picture and the overall story of the whole anime and I was expecting to figure out information for the anime since the movie is canon but in the end, it felt like filler with a character that has a minimal connection the MC dying.",

The high production value is noticeable from the very first scene, with better quality animation (not that it was anything less than stellar in the series). Speaking of which, from the beginning to the ending of the film, the action packed story wastes no time launching us back into the Demon Slayer world when season 1 ended and the film moves at a breakneck pace. However, this isn't too jarring for those who didn't watch the series (though it helps a lot). The rest of the film is gets even better as it goes, with  impressive voicework and animation that really shines in the final act. The action set pieces are breathtaking and the film ends on a high note. There is also a mostly emotionally investing storyline, but does falter due to writing issues.\n Significantly the second act is where problems arise. The film rushes too quickly past touching moments in the first act to leap into the action of the second act, ruining any sort of emotional investment during the following sequences. There are also numerous random plot conveniences introduced, which seem interesting in concept but weak in execution. The animation quality is also inconsistent here.\nThe first act and the finale of the film really carry this movie, as well as the technical marvel of the film.\n8.1/10",

One of my personal favorites so far has been the newer and impressive \"Demon Slayer.\" I got into the series because I had heard of this movie coming out, so I checked it out. This movie is strictly for fans of the series as it follows directly after the events of the first season. I think it does have plenty of exciting action and colorful animation that I loved, but it also didn't do that much to advance the plot. It felt more like a proper finale to season one and stops at an enticing point to get me hyped for season two. Overall, if you're a fan of the series, I can't imagine you disliking this movie, it is more of the same high-energy fun I have come to expect from this universe.",

I also wouldn’t recommend it as a stand alone movie for someone who has never seen the series. Some manga/anime movies you can still get the gist of without having to know all the back storyline. This is not really one of those kinds of movies. Only a fan of the series can appreciate this movie.",
