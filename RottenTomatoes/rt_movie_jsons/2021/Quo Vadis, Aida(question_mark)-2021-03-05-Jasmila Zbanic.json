            "content": "Bosnia-Herzegovina's submission for the 93rd Academy Awards is a heart-wrenching story fuelled by a mother's desire to protect her family. Throughout the 101 minutes, viewers are taken on a harrowing journey through crowded UN bases to wartorn towns and cities.\n\nBased on a true story, 'Quo Vadis, Aida?' follows Aida Selmanagić (Jasna Đuričić), a translator for the UN, from a small town known as Srebrenica. When the Serbian army takes over the town, her family is among the thousands of residents forced to leave their homes and seek shelter within the UN base where she works. Despite her family being in imminent danger, Aida must remain calm and collected while Bosnian General Ratko Mladić (Boris Isaković) engages in negotiations to maintain the civilians 'safety'. Will Aida be able to save her family while translating crucial information?\n\nJasna Đuričić gives a sensational performance in the leading role. Her portrayal of Aida is effortlessly fuelled by a mother's love for her family. Her need to protect her family oozes off the screen and only makes viewers sympathise even more with the character. The supporting cast also gives exceptional performances. Boris Isaković plays General Ratko with a perfect amount of arrogance, he portrays him as the monster he is without being too in your face. Izudin Bajrović, Boris Ler and Dino Bajrović all provide performances that show just how daunting a situation they're in.\n\nDirector Jasmila Žbanić delivers such a devastating and brutal film to viewers, all the while keeping them interested and keeping the film moving. As well as directing, Žbanić also serves as producer and writer, providing the cast with a beautifully written script to work from. Christine A Maier's cinematography is utterly captivating, with imagery ranging from tight close-ups to wide shots framing swarms of helpless civilians, shocking viewers and giving them something to sympathise with that isn't Aida's struggle. Frequent handheld shots make viewers feel even more immersed in the gut-wrenching tragedy unfolding in front of them.\n\n'Quo Vadis, Aida?' does an excellent job of showing Aida's struggle as well as the wider problem, Aida's family isn't the only family displaced by the horrors of war. Žbanić also includes scenes that help viewers to realise just how many people had been affected by what was going on at the time. The numerous close-ups of character's faces throughout the film add yet another layer of emotion for viewers to sympathise with, and maybe even relate to. The film also does a great job following Aida's struggle as a mother to keep her family safe, begging on her knees and hiding them in machines in an effort to keep them near to her and away from whatever fate may lie ahead.\n\nThe film will appeal to many people as not only does it explore themes of family, but it also explores the idea of war. 'Quo Vadis, Aida?' isn't the first film made about the Srebrenica massacre, films like 'Srebrenica: A Cry from the Grave' and 'Circles' both follow the horrors that occurred during the Bosnian War, which only ended roughly 25 years ago. Overall, 'Quo Vadis, Aida?' is a harrowing tale that depicts the savagery of war and the desperation to keep your family safe.",

Its critically acclaimed stature shall be its main draw if dramatized historical events are unheard of prior to viewing, which should typically change afterwards when fully grasped what it was building up towards with evoked shock value that rarely punches cinematically, before punching harder amid depressing closure leading into a poetic polishing end. Brilliantly directed as dread looms uncertainty, powerfully performed enabling connective resonance, and emotionally punched at ideal appropriateness – brief further research showed another side that's best left implied, this type of historical exposure spread intimate awareness towards overseas events that deserves our acknowledging attention via impactful visions.

Machell, cine-vue.com\n\n… made even more urgent amidst the Russian war against Ukraine! The indifference masked as collaborative action is startling, and so weak. It continues to cost lives\n\nTo my mind, I've seen only one other wartime film as harrowing, stark and shocking as QVA, and that is Schindler's List. Of a different era, telling of a different genocide, it is as impactive, and sadly shows a number of similarities to WWII\n\nAn incredibly powerful and sombre movie, filled with emotional performances, and overseen by a masterful Director.

Set in 1995 Bosnia it's historical fiction with characters weaved in with the tragic and awful Srebrenica massacre. Central to the film is Aida, a teacher who has been co opted to be an interpreter for the UN. The film begins with Serbian forces laying siege to Srebrenica forcing the citizens to flee to the nearby UN base. Sadly the base can only take so many people with the rest stranded outside fearing for their lives. Aida's husband and two sons are among the stranded. All of this leads to a tense standoff between the UN and the Serbian forces led by General Mladic. This incredibly impressive film manages to weave together the strategies of war and diplomacy with the overwhelming human story of Aida's family and the besieged Bosnians. It's a tense ride as each second is filled with impending doom. Jasna Duricic is superb in the lead role, her character is filled with integrity, intelligence and bravery. This was an awful period in human history and this important film brings it lucidly to light.",

            "content": "This was the first film I'd visited the cinema to see on my own (the best and blissful way) in a very long time, and I'll make no bones about it, Quo Vadis Aida is quite possibly the best film I've seen so far this year. That's certainly not to say it's an easy watch, there are moments in the film where you can barely look at the screen, and much of that is down to the true story at the heart of the film. Set mainly over the course of a few days in 1995, Aida (a staggering performance by Jasna Đuričić) is a translator for the UN in the small town of Srebrenica, in Bosnia. Despite promises from the UN to protect the town amidst an approaching Serbian army invasion, their assurances are backed up by a horrible no show as the invasion begins, and the town is forced to flee, a small percentage of them managing to take refuge in the UN camp on the edge of the town, until the camp closes its doors; restricting the remainder of the town to remain outside the camp's gates. This in itself is harrowing, but Aida has more problems than rushing about translating between the townspeople and UN soldiers; her husband and two boys are somewhere amongst the thousands of homeless Srebrenicans. She repeatedly tries to barter for their safety, and then as things take a nasty turn, their escape. We are left in no doubt of Aida's priority, it's a truly breathtaking portrayal by Đuričić, the performance equally as powerful when she's not front and centre. What makes the film so disturbing is that through Aida, we appreciate and feel what all the families in Srebrenica were going through. The Serbian forces, led by the lunatic General Mladic, offer a way out for all the people after a hastily arranged negotiation between himself and three wildly unqualified Srebrenicans, including Aida's husband. The elation of the townspeople when it seems Mladic has offered a way out is palpable; it seems inevitable all won't go to plan for them. Quo Vaids Aida is beautifully shot, you feel like you're right there with the unfortunate habitants of Srebrenica, feeling the claustrophobia and stench of the camp. It's far from an easy watch, but it's a topic that really should be addressed more, especially to younger generations who seem to know less and less about the real world. The fact that this sort of thing (without trying to give too much away) goes on today and we know little about it, makes the film even more hard hitting, twenty six odd years on. The final quarter of the film is a masterpiece in emotional grief, acceptance, and an astonishing grit; the film is hard to pin down as a genre, and the final twenty minutes or so toughen an attempt to do so. I left the screening in tatters, returning to my car, only to switch on the radio and hear that the country was crying about a tweet that a teenager had written nine years ago, and as a result should apparently have his promising career stripped from him. After watching Quo Vadis Aida, and seeing what some of the real world has to deal with, this particular news left a disgusting taste.",

            "content": "The massacre of Srebrenica is unfortunately known to too few people - but above all, most people do not have on their radar how relatively recently this tragedy of July 11, 1995 occurred. In Quo Vadis, Aida? we follow Aida, a teacher working for the United Nations as a translator in a UN protection camp with a thousand citizens. Thanks to her work, Aida believes that she and her family are safe from the genocide taking place outside the camp. However, she gets to feel in a brutal way that a war knows no justice.\n\nThe plot always focuses on protagonist Aida (Jasna Duricic) and her iron will to bring her family to protection. Because no one is prioritized in such an exceptional situation, Aida often does not get what she wants. Yet she was hoping for exactly this consequence due to her special position as a translator. This results in some heated discussions and arguments with UN commanders and soldiers, who regularly refuse Aida's wishes. Duricic especially succeeds in this role in drawing the audience to her side and making them suffer with Aida. Of course, her actions are perfectly legitimate and it's frustrating every time to see her rebuffed. As an audience member, on the other hand, it's difficult to put ourselves in this situation. After all, for the most part, we have no idea what these struggles for survival in war feel like. Accordingly, it's not my place to judge the characters' behaviors, which don't seem particularly ethical to us. As much tension and back-and-forth tugging as this caused in me, unfortunately Duricic couldn't quite reach me emotionally. The nightmare she personally finds herself in with her family, and especially the mission to deliver bad news to the suffering survivors, can't be beat for incomprehension and emotional weight. However, I always felt as if the actress was always in a certain stage of empathy and self-pity that she couldn't get out of for the entire film. To me, there's a bit of a lack of breakthrough below that surface, where you could have bought into her suffering even more. Sure, she has scenes where she has outbursts and comes out of her equilibrium. However, these have been in short supply and once they are due, they are either too short or lack emotional impact for me.\n\nThis is one of the few criticisms I can give the film. But even in this respect, it would not trigger enough emotions in me, it is successful in the end. Because I left the cinema with a heavy blow in the pit of my stomach and struggled for composure and words because of the, not really unpredictable, outcome. The subject matter sits too deep for that and leaves a layman, who was lucky enough not to have had to experience a war yet, shocked. Besides the fact how recently the event happened and the geographical proximity, I would have wished for some more impressions and information about Srebrenica. Thus, Quo Vadis, Aida? is not really a war film, but rather a character study that creates an eerie and authentic atmosphere.",

A mother, who's also an interpreter, tried to get her family to safety while the civilians were being transported by the Serbian force. \n\nComing in, I didn't know anything about the real life story. However, after watching about 10 to 15 minutes, it was abundantly clear what was going to happen. For the rest of the movie, it became a desperate, maddening, and heartbreaking descend into the inevitable. This was shown through the lens of our main character, and her desperation was relatable, like if you were in her shoes you would do everything she did. \n\nThe color and cinematography also heightened the desperation. The movie looked monotonous. The overwhelming color of the ground during the day felt hot, dry, and reflected the dire situation the civilians were in. Even more, the movie felt so raw, making me feel like I'm actually there with the people. \n\nAnd then the ending hit. I knew it was coming, but still I was in silence as the camera slowly moved away. There's no need for showing actual violence. Just the sound was enough to convey the horror. The last scene was a strong testament of the director about the unjust event.\n\nOverall, a devastating movie that i would not want to see again. 9/10",

It’s a very important story told very well, and it definitely deserved its Oscar nomination. I recommend checking this one out.",

            "content": "Excellent movie done in collaboration by producers and actors from all over Europe. However, I actually think the horrors and the destruction were underplayed in this movie since it highlights a story of a single family. These and worse atrocities were committed to thousands of other innocent families. Some survivors lost as many as 15 family members (mostly men). Their homes and personal belongings were pillaged, women were raped (as a result, many got pregnant and gave birth to babies that carry their abusers' genes), men of all ages were executed (including teenage boys and 70+ year olds), kids were orphaned and families destroyed for generations. And all of this happened in the heart of Europe with the whole world watching....... All of this happened less than a 13-15 hour drive from Rome and Vienna..... both booming with tourists in that hot summer of ‘95. Never forget the Srebrenica genocide! One human life lost is too many, let alone 8000+. May they all Rest In Peace.",

Told from the perspective of a UN interpreter who struggles to find safety for her family during the crisis, the film follows the ordeals of Muslim refugees fleeing the onslaught of merciless Serb militants and the United Nations' inability and ineptitude in providing the protection promised them. Director Jasmila Zbanic's latest puts viewers in the middle of the unfolding genocide, re-creating the horror and anguish experienced by those caught up in it without ever becoming graphic or gratuitous but nevertheless palpably unnerving. The excellent ensemble cast, led by the award-worthy performance of Jasna Djuricic as the desperate protagonist, sell this story so effectively that one can't help but feel what they and their peers are going through. \"Quo Vadis, Aida?\" will undoubtedly leave audiences uncomfortable and heartbroken, but it brings to light the unspeakable atrocities that occurred during this conflict in hopes that we never experience it again.",
