    "summary": "Border vigilante Bill Greer (Frank Grillo) and his son Jackson (Jake Allyn) are on patrol when Jackson accidentally kills a Mexican immigrant boy. Bill tries to take the blame but Texas Ranger Ramirez (George Lopez) sees through the lie, spurring Jackson to flee south on horseback across the Rio Grande to become a gringo \"illegal alien\" in Mexico. Chased by Texas Rangers and Mexican federales, Jackson journeys across deserts and mountains to seek forgiveness from the dead boy's vengeful father (Jorge A. Jimenez), as he falls in love with the land he was taught to hate.",

            "content": "The screenplay is the reason this film fails badly. It cannot decide which point of view to present. After beautifully depicting and defining the area between the border and Texas as a dangerous filled with 'coyotes' who may take you across or just as soon kill you, the film becomes \"Both Sides Now\" in a circuitous, laborious, stultifying, stupefying bore. There are the marauders who cut the rancher's fences, steal his cattle on a regular basis. Defend your land and way of life by pursuing them and come across good, moral, religious people fleeing a life of poverty, hunger and crime for the opportunity in America. 'Bad' escape arrest; 'Good' get hurt or killed. \nThe hard-working ranch family become duplicitous, evasive liars, totally ignoring the emotions of the son that did the killing. He speaks, pleads, they ignore his anguish. Foolishly, he runs across the border where he is an emotional wreck and a cultural idiot. WHY? We begin a long, long journey  seeking redemption, but first we must have 'adventures' to show how wonderful the Mexican people really are. The ending violence in which the grotesque coyote is justly killed but all others kiss and makeup is absurd as is the two year prison sentence. A waste of time.",

            "content": "This thoughtful film could have been a minor modern epic if it had been given a stronger script. As is, it holds interest until some poorly developed story details begin to become too obvious. It's also photographically patchy, with cheap handheld shots bringing down the better-constructed sequences. Some distracting editing in the first half won't help it gain the attention the overall story is straining for – a pity because the whole thing has very good intentions as we follow a young man's attempts to redeem himself for an accidental killing. \n\nPerformances are sincere with the casting generally convincing, it's just the weak moments in the script that let it down. Music is well used throughout including a couple of interesting songs and the outdoor locations standing in for the Tex-Mex border add impact – those who don't feel the need to analyze their entertainment won't mind the flaws, others may be let down.",

Manufactured unrealistic and irrational situations in an attempt to make its audience feel desperation and vulnerability. But instead of being hooked by those emotions at key points (as you normally would in a good thriller or action), you are pushed away by the dullness and unlikely foundations used to trigger such emotions. I found myself wanting to turn this off in the early stages of the movie and move on to something else but there was enough there to \"give it 15 more minutes\". You end up watching the rest of the movie with this feeling until it finally ends in a predictable and unremarkable manner. While there are real issues at the Texas-Mexico border, for the ranchers who live there and for those in Mexico wanting to cross, the creators of this film didn't strike me as having enough experience with the border or ranching to really hit the bulls eye here (small example - a ranch kid would never drink from the Rio Grande River or be bothered by cactus. There are so many examples like this but will not spoil the more meaningful contradictions). In any event, there were many contradictions like this that unintentionally undermined the character's role,  preventing you from being hooked. There is substantial movie worthy plots at the border, but like a tumbleweed, this one blows with the wind.",

This dragged the movie a bit much. Then, besides the victim's father character, the rest of the characters were pretty bland. The acting needs more emotions to create more impact to the movie. \n\nOverall, a pretty ok Western drama. 6/10",

The story of families - one living in/near No Man's land in the US and the other trying to get to the US, is a good one. The largest weakness is the main character, Jackson, played by Jake Allyn, who is also the screenwriter and brother of the film's director, Conor Allyn. Jackson is a slack-jawed kid with less personality than Peyton Manning. (He could play young Peyton in a bio-pic for sure.) The story moves with his accidental shooting of a Mexican boy attempting a border crossing and moves along with his attempt to, in an unspoken way, make it right.\nYou see some interesting and diverse countryside, and a lot of Jackson riding his horse, saying \"I don't speak Spanish,\" and a lot of other things that might happen when the lead and director are siblings and the director won't say, \"Bro, give me SOMETHING!\"\nToo supporting actors who do give something are Esmeralda Pimentel as Victoria, the rancher whose family takes Jackson on as a worker for awhile, and Andrés Delgado, as Luis, the coyote who pops up to divert Jackson's travels. They keep the movie interesting when they are on screen.\nNo Man's Land passed the time, but it was rather bland.",
