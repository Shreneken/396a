This movie isn't all that special; sure, it's good to pass the time when you're bored and have nothing else to do. Ultimately it's just your regular run-of-the-mill teenagers in a bad predicament type of story. The only really cool scene is when they're stuck in a train car for a short period of time, I thought that was creative.",

            "content": "Ok here is the thing; The movie that the cinema got was NOT a good movie. I got to watch the superior version; the extended version. This was not actually an extended cut, rather another cut of the movie, with tons of new scenes and deleted scenes, with a whole other story. In other words; the extended cut was greater! It had a solid plan from the start, with an interesting storyline and backstory of where these rooms are being created, why and how. \n(SPOILERS)\nWhen the creator of these rooms are stuck in an escape-room herself, with a hidden agenda of trying to find someone to solve the code to her own escape room, so that she can confront her own dad was genius writing! And the post credit scene, making her the next \"villain\"... genius writing. I will definitely watch a sequel to this version of the movie. \n\nIt had the same pacing problem as the first one had, but these escape rooms were more realistic and they really upped the game for these designs. Even the escape rooms had a story this time, which was a relly clever detail that they revealed at the end of the movie. The cast were great in this movie as well.\n\nBut the way they brough back one of the already \"dead\" players from the first movie, because of her name and popularity irl, and said that she was forced to make the escape room, added NOTHING to the story, and felt more like a cashgrab-moment. Sony's commitment-issue to this project has broken the series. Now we all are confused about which version is the one they will keep building on, or if they ever will... \nThey should as we have one version with a really great storyline, that adds a ton to the organisation Minos, but we also have one where our main characters are yet again on the airplane that was previously used as the cliff-hanger, and a situation where they definitely will survive, as they are the main characters...\n\n(Exteded cut: 4 stars)\n(Cinema cut: 1,5 stars)",

I'm thankful to see the sequel introduces new mysteries and more twists and turns within the story. The rooms, again, are so stunning to see visually, and the audio track is a blast, but watching attempts to escape is not always exciting to see, and sadly, big twists here are highly predictable. Lines of dialogue feel more fitting for a teenage audience. Granted, it's still fun and brainless, and I was left hoping we see the third instalment in due time.",

            "content": "Watch the Extended Cut for the director's real story instead of the studio mandated cash grab Theatrical Cut!\n\nDirector Adam Robitel's survival horror mystery Escape Room: Tournament of Champions (2021) is one of the most entertaining horror movies I've seen in years! It's incredibly funny and gripping with constant humorous offhand remarks from these clever survivors. I found every escape room fascinating with intense and brutal kills alongside the pretty inventive clues to the deadly puzzles. Robitel does a great job directing with creative kills and an eerie atmosphere as characters panic and reason out clues in an enthralling way. Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is very much like Escape Room with more likable heroes and a better twist, just as long as you only watch the amazing Extended Cut.\n\nThe 88 minute version is the inferior theatrical cut that stupidly brings back Deborah Ann Woll's Amanda character from the first as if she could have survived that fall. I'm assuming the studio panicked and brought back Woll in a cash grab attempt to gain viewers with a big name actress again. They gave Zoey a therapist and added an FBI agent along with a lame story. You learn nothing new about Minos and their dark organization of escape room designers in the garbage theatrical cut. Watch the longer extended cut that's 94 minutes long that is clearly the director's cut and original vision. It's obviously better as it has Orphan actress and horror queen Isabelle Fuhrman in a significant role and a far superior storyline that actually lets you in on Minos more with an intriguing narrative.\n\nWriters Oren Uziel, Fritz BÃ¶hm, Will Honley, Maria Melnik, Christine Lavaf, and Daniel Tuch really get creative with the violence and puzzles as well as for their intriguing mystery about Minos, who makes all the escape room mazes. Minos forcing former escape room survivors to compete again is a fun premise for Tournament of Champions. It's like in The Hunger Games when the previous victors have to be tributes once more with a bit of Saw and Cube in the mix. I love the hilarious jokes that feel modern and witty. The puzzles are very complex this time and quite smart. I'm not sure I could have solved the escape rooms this time either. Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is incredibly suspenseful with perilous traps and intricate clues to deadly puzzles to ensnare and confuse the survivors. I appreciate the Isabelle Fuhrman storyline that adds needed depth and twists to Escape Room: Tournament of Champions.\n\nTaylor Russell brings a raw emotional clarity that allows her heroine Zoey Davis to feel rational to solve puzzles and devastating as her friends die around her in escape rooms. She's captivating and lovely just like she was in Escape Room. I'm definitely a fan of Taylor Russell now after Waves, Escape Room, and Tournament of Champions. She can play anything. She can feel shy and awkward to courageous and encouraging. Her eyes and facial expressions show a sheer determination and eager knowledge that helps make Zoey feel like the smartest girl in the escape room. Taylor Russell is now a Scream Queen and a wicked cool final girl in the horror genre because of Escape Room.\n\nLogan Miller is very endearing as the frantic and concerned Ben Miller. He feels like a regular guy trapped in an awful situation. Holland Roden is amazing as the sharp and resourceful Rachel Ellis. I found her very compelling and her last scene is outstandingly acted. Indya Moore is fun as the outrageous influencer Brianna Collier. She feels distinct and often intelligent in her own way compared to the two main girls. Thomas Cocquerel is very moving and thoughtful as the brave priest Nathan, who is suffering a crisis of faith. Carlito Olivero is fun as the panicked Theo on the train. James Frain is fascinating as the stoic and cruel Henry the puzzle maker. Tanya van Graan is touching and mesmerizing as Claire's mother Sonya in the opening sequence.\n\nIsabelle Fuhrman steals the show as the inventive and crafty game creator Claire. I hope she's in the sequel to Escape Room: Tournament of Champions as she's clearly a genius. Fuhrman blew my mind in Orphan and she continues to dominate the horror genre with shocking twists and gripping acting. She's a remarkably talented and versatile actress, who can sell you on any given emotion that her character wants to manipulate you into feeling. Isabelle Fuhrman is a gorgeous young lady, skilled actress, and hypnotic character in Escape Room: Tournament of Champions. I look forward to her in a sequel as well as her upcoming Orphan prequel First Kill.\n\nEditors Steve Mirkovich and Peter Pav cut up all these neat montages of scenes for reminders about clues or the layout of an escape room. I feel like their hectic pacing keeps Escape Room: Tournament of Champions moving fast. Cinematographer Marc Spicer returns for shifting camera perspectives between characters for quick reaction shots to new clues and dangers. I found all the medium and close-up shots enthralling, especially when things focus on Taylor Russell or Isabelle Fuhrman. The spinning shots in small tunnels also feature tighter framing to reel in on a sense of claustrophobia.\n\nEdward Thomas' production design really nails specific parameters for each escape room like the underground bank with account boxes, tiled floor, and counter space. The New York bodega room is charming too. It looks dirty and wet. Art direction from Mark Walters and Cecelia van Straaten create heating up saunas, breathtaking beaches, and industrial warehouses each with a unique aesthetic like the New York bodega and train compartment.\n\nVisual effects artists Neishaw Ali, Kyle Menzies, Bert Poole, Jyoti Bhalchandra Deshpande, Jev Belyaev, Asha Bhaskaran, and Cary Smith create outstandingly realistic CGI for glass computer walls or flashing lights. Electricity bursts all over the train carriage, lasers sear skin in the bank's security system, the shifting beach room with sifting quicksand, burning acid rain in the bodega room, and the searing heat of the sauna room are all terrifying to imagine going through as an ordeal.\n\nComposers Brian Tyler and John Carey's electronic score sounds like Daft Punk and Skrillex on LSD. They create chaotic noise and exciting synth driven music to up the intensity of every scene. I love the song in the end credits, especially. Sound designers Greg P. Russell, Sean McCormack, and Kevin O'Connell go crazy with the loud electricity shocks and echoing acid rain pattering across the bodega surfaces. Their noises sound real, but also incredibly tense. Reza Levy's costumes are flattering and contemporary with a slick fashion.\n\nOverall, Tournament of Champions is as good as Escape Room as long as you see the Extended Cut as the director intended instead of the studio butchered Theatrical Cut.",

There were some thrills in this movie, and minor scares -- nothing that is too over-the-top. There really isn't much twist turns except maybe the one near the end. The whole movie felt very short . . . it only felt like that because a lot was happening in this film. I wished the movie was longer than just 89 minutes. This movie is far from being my favorite horror movie, but it's quite good to be honest. It brings fourth the games to like \"The Next Level.\" The scale of violence in here isn't really that intense/graphic. The 1st movie felt more tense than this first movie.

Frantic screaming aside (especially the character Ben's, who is unfortunately the least sympathetic despite being the deuteragonist), they're all intelligent people who understand the concept of solidarity and try their best to bring each other out alive, and I truly appreciate that.",

            "content": "Some winner's circle.  So in case you don't recall the events from two years ago, Zoey (Taylor Russell) and Ben (Logan Miller) managed to escape the most lethal escape room of all time.  However, there was a larger game afoot, and unbeknownst to them, people behind the scenes were pulling the strings.  Those mysterious powers that be are back again, and even though we are only on the second movie, they want to see an all-winners tournament, so they get six survivors back to pit them against their deadly rooms.  Now despite giving it a negative rating, I actually like the first Escape Room.  It has a horrendous ending that knocked it significantly back for me, but other than that, I do have positive feelings about it.  It almost felt like the movie got a positive response from test audiences, and they had different endings filmed that they could choose from, so they went with the one that left the door open for sequels.  Here we are with said sequel, and for better or worse, Tournament of Champions is more of the same.  So if you're at all familiar with how Hollywood approaches horror franchises, you can see what they are trying to do here.  In my option, they're trying to make this series into the next Saw.  They don't cost a ton of money to bankroll, so a profit is all but guaranteed.  You can use green actors since the gimmick is the attraction, not the star power, so that's another area where you can save money.  You also give bread crumbs to a larger overarching story, which leaves people coming back for more.  For me, it's the larger picture that is the weakest aspect.  It's the bookends to this that fail to resonate: the start and the finish.  It's where the writing is at its most flimsy, and it is where the script is at its worst.  That said, when you take this at face value when people are just trying to escape a room, that is where this series finds the most success.  I believe that the majority of this movie's audience has attended an escape room, so it is relatable, and the fact that they up the stakes with fatal consequences does heighten your investment.  Even if you don't care about these characters (and to be clear, I was never concerned who lived or died), you can still put yourself in the room with them, so you want to crack the elaborate puzzle.  The rooms here are extensive, but I would be lying if I said there isn't entertainment value there.  Much like the first movie, you have to roll with the setup and give some serious suspension of your disbelief to get into this story.  If you can do that here, I don't think you're going to have a terrible time.  I didn't care for the ending of this chapter either, but because I saw the first movie give such wildly dreadful punctuation, it didn't bother me as much this time around.  The pacing keeps this moving at a decent clip, and it doesn't allow you too much time to focus on how poor the dialogue is.  I'll probably keep watching this series if the producers choose to continue it, and you should approach it at your own discretion.",

There are some characters who are just there for being there and don't deepen their characterization even a little, making us not care about their lives. This problem does not motivate us to care about some characters makes us end up not caring much about the story itself, because they are the ones who move the plot. But they do have great characters and very well built that can replace some that are left out. The plot twist that happens at the end is really cool because Amanda was a character that could be very well evolved in the first film and knowing that she will be important in the plot of possible sequels makes us anxious to know what the outcome would be. that the story would put male characters on top. But it seems that how they inserted this plot in the middle of the story was played anyway, out of nowhere. the script could have been much more built on the plot and written with some hints of what could come at the beginning of the film, but unfortunately I didn't do that. It seemed that first they thought about this plot and then they made the plot to fit it. On the other hand,\n There's not much to complain about about this movie, there are not-so-impressive performances that don't fail and the movie is a lot of fun and makes us interested in the outcome and who could survive or not. There's a lot of the story where we actually think Ben was killed by the escape room but in the third act we know that all of that was a trap for Zoe, and that was a great insight from the script that really surprised a lot of the audience. Escape Room 2: Tournment Of Champions is a good basic feature of deadly games and that fulfills what is required of a movie of its kind. 7.5 / 10",

The pattern it follows is mind-dumbing incompetent.  They present a dilemma. The characters try two or three ways out. They fail. Then a shot of our heroine as she thinks.  Suddenly she blurts out the solution, which works just in time!  This same thing is done throughout the movie.  It boggles the mind how Hollywood thinks it is giving us some kind of art.

Our two survivors are back trapped in another series of games from Minos, along with other previous survivors.\n\nThe first movie was not too bad, but for me, the sequel is a major step up. I had a lot of fun with all the escape games. The premises of each game were interesting and complexed, and most of all, they were incredibly intense. As time kept running and running off, I was more on the edge of my seat. Even more, the movie had little break between each game and kept the intensity high throughout.\n\nThe acting was also solid among everyone. Our main character, played solidly by Taylor Russell, was clearly smart, as well as the villainous organization. I also liked that the director was aware of what the movie was about, so there was minimal attempt to give backgrounds to the side characters. However, they did gave some quick background anyway, and of course those didn't have much impact. \n\nMy biggest problem was probably the PG-13 rating. Similar to the 2019 movie, some gore would have made the ending of each game more intense and impactful. They moved on very quickly from each game in order to avoid the gores that they could have shown. There could have been more fun.\n\nOverall, a solid and entertaining thriller throughout. 8/10",

            "content": "Witnessing the last ten or so minutes of 2019's Escape Room is one of my most cherished theater experiences of all time. What had been a better than expected, overall solid January thriller took the steepest and most immediate ninety degree dive in quality of any movie I've been privy to just as it was about to successfully hit the finish line. It was a very pure, WTF chaos that's still in its own league of madness to this day. So, to say I was excited when a sequel was announced is a big ol' understatement. And you pretty much get what you pay for with Escape Room: Tournament of Champions.\n\nTaylor Russell and Logan Miller return as Zoey and Ben, and they're are mad as heck. As the only two survivors of the last film, the duo has been itching to return to New York to unearth evidence exposing the people responsible for their trauma, the shady Minos Corporation, but once they arrive, fail they to uncover anything at the remains of the building they were trapped in. Just as Zoey and Ben call it quits, a homeless man pickpockets them, sending them on a frenzied chase through the city that eventually lands them in, you guessed it, another maze of deadly escape rooms.\n\nAs the title implies, Zoe and Ben are joined this time around by other survivors of Minos' twisted escape rooms, but overall, Tournament of Champions just offers up more of the same goods of the last go around. Apart from the usual life and death, there are no greater stakes built up through the film as a sequel, the titular \"tournament\" angle being sort of a misnomer given there's no extra dynamic or level of competition between this veteran batch of characters. Once the first escape room reveals itself to be just that, our characters just get into the flow a little quicker and with more exasperated, eye-rolling chagrin. But as the last movie was pretty fun, this sequel ain't half bad.\n\nThe unpredictability and pressuring timers each new set piece features makes for a good popcorn summer movie, though with an always ticking clock and deviously intricate setups, the movie's a little too fast-paced for a viewer to engage with all (or any, really) of the clues hidden across each room's many nooks and crannies. While still pretty cool and imaginative, the rooms in Tournament of Champions are much more detail-oriented than the last film's, which used environmental features and practical sense to reach their solutions. Though the first film also had you trailing characters for clues, it's a problem felt more strongly this time around. Going through the film's puzzles completely second-hand still just isn't as satisfying as it would be going into an escape room on your own, but there are enough thrills packed into every scenario to keep the ride's momentum and your eyes thoroughly fixed to the screen.\n\nThe cast is good, but not quite as well-rounded as the first film's, either. There's less archetypal charisma in this set of characters, and Russell still doesn't click as the film's lead. Don't get me wrong, she's a fantastic actor (just go and see her show-stopping performance in Waves), but she's directed in maybe too baby-faced a manner for her to successfully lead the horror/thriller aspects of the film in a serious way. It's still baffling Daredevil's fantastic Deborah Ann Woll wasn't chosen as the first film's and subsequent series lead.\n\nOn a somewhat random note, I also couldn't help thinking of The Cabin in the Woods while watching Tournament of Champions. As a sequel, Tournament of Champions should have gone into Minos' lore and motivations even just a tiny bit, maybe opening up towards full-blown zaniness like The Cabin in the Woods does towards its ending. You never see the people behind the seemingly omniscient corporation, so the abstracted information feels like it's building up towards some big reveal like alien experimentation, Matrix computer shit, I don't know, but it never comes. Hey, maybe the third time's the charm.",

No. The plot was rushed, there were some gaping plot holes, the dialogue was uninspired and the acting was sub par.

But that being said, the special effects and set designs were outstanding - and as someone who loved both The Hunger Games and Escape rooms, I thought the concept was perfect. Yes, it could have been much better executed but it was fun to watch and thats what's most important!",

            "content": "Like I've said before, when there's money to be made, a sequel there will be. Especially when it comes to mediocre horror films and them being turned into franchises. One of my first reviews on this page was of the original Escape Room and as I stated that film was a fun popcorn flick until its ending where it tried to be too smart and ultimately existed just to set up another movie. Well that other movie is here and uhhhhh. I have a few positives and they are much like the first film, the rooms set up are unique and creative which forces the characters to solve the increasingly harder puzzles to get out with their lives. It made for some tense sequences and like the last movie there were some pretty creative use of the camera all be it of way too many dutch angle shots. I felt that Taylor Russell and Logan Miller both improved their performances from the last one and their chemistry was well presented. Now all the rest...first things first the title of this movie is atrocious and it's actually mentioned in the film (as seen in the trailer) once and is never brought up again. The new characters may be less annoying than the last ones but are considerably weaker on the page. We just know that they've won one of these deadly escape rooms once as well and that's about the extent of what we get and the film fails to get us caring about them all. Not to mention one of them felt like a cartoon character and was the first to get killed off. I think where this movie fails way worse than the last one is its story and how it begins. It all just starts from sheer dumb luck and plot convenience. I'm going to get into some soft spoilers in the next sentence. Something is stolen from a character and a Jason Bourne chase begins and the characters end up in a subway car. Conveniently the same one the rest of the previous winners are in and it's conveniently the subway car that's the escape room. It doesn't flow like a narrative at all, just plot armor to get the movie going. Also there's a character that I guess doesn't feel pain? It's not even explained how or why, it's just something she can tolerate but ends up dying anyway. It's all so unbelievably lucky and contrived to where it doesn't feel like I'm watching something to get invested in. It's just convenience at every corner. Listen I get that all of these characters won their first escape rooms and are obviously both smart and lucky because of it. But good god, the short amount of time it takes them to figure out these insanely convoluted puzzles is just baffling to me and it took me right out of the film. Alright, so this movies ending is no where near as bad as the first films ending but good god...there's a twist in this movie that is up there on worst horror twists I've seen. It takes away any and all tension I had in my favorite scene of the first film, and is just so unrealistic to the point where you want to shout out \"WTF\" to the screen. I'm not exaggerating...it is THAT bad. Just like the final scene of the last movie there's a setup for another one, and now all of a sudden this movie felt like a placeholder. Like it was made to make this a trilogy. Two movies in, and we still know nothing about this organization and I can only assume one of two things. The third movie will explain what's going on in an overly convoluted way, or we still won't get answers and we'll get a fourth movie. Oh and that device that I mentioned was taken from a character at the beginning of the movie which led to the plot beginning is returned back to said character at the end of the movie. How and why? Don't know. Don't think about it. I wouldn't recommend this movie purely on the basis that it exists to set up a third film. Don't support this studio project. Granted if it was a good sequel like A Quiet Place: Part 2, then that'd be different. I'm gonna give Escape Room: Tournament of Champions, a C-",

        {
            "content": "I was a tremendous fan of director Adam Robitel's surprise 2019 hit Escape Room, which proved to be a clever, engaging thriller that forced its cast to survive a series of lethal escape rooms staged by a mysterious and powerful agency calling itself Minos. That film won me over by focusing on the characters working together and using their wits to make it out of the rooms, rather than taking the Saw route and pushing elaborately gory death scenes. With the emphasis being on how the characters survived rather than setting up their gruesome demise, the film managed to invest the inevitable deaths with greater power, giving them more impact. Despite stumbling in the third act with a series of false endings, the movie was extremely entertaining and ended up as one of my favorite releases of that year.\n\nWhen the sequel was officially announced I was excited, but also wary . As any fan of the horror genre knows, sequels â even ones as obviously set up as this one â have a tendency to disappoint across the board. They often fail to add anything to the mythos of a franchise, frequently making the error of retreading what we've already seen, resulting in a diminished experience.\n\nFortunately, Escape Room: Tournament of Champions avoids falling into that trap (pun intended). This tight, ferocious sequel hits the ground running and doesn't let up. At a slim 88 minutes, it tells a solid story and moves with the efficiency of a well-oiled machine.\n\nThe film picks up where the original left off, literally offering viewers a recap of the previous events before landing on Zoey (the enchanting and likeable Taylor Russel, who again shines like a star in this heroic, courageous role), who is in therapy to deal with the loss and suffering Minos caused.\n\nAfter a session with her doctor finds her re-committing to tracking down Minos and exposing what they've been doing, Zoey enlists fellows survivor Ben (a returning Logan Miler, as sarcastic and likeable as the last time we saw him) to travel with her to New York to visit a location she's tracked down using coordinates embedded in the Minos symbol.\n\nThe intrepid pair arrive, find the building and are accosted by a stranger who snatches Zoey's bag. They give chase and end up on a subway car, where Zoey begins to pick up a strange vibe about the other passengers. Things begin to go sideways in a terrifyingly familiar way and quickly everyone discovers they are in another Minos escape room. Even more frightening is the revelation each of them are survivors of a previous game, just like Zoey and Ben, all having apparently been brought together by Minos to see who will win what one character labels a \"contest of champions\".\n\nDirector Adam Robitel knows exactly what he's doing this second time around and paces the film with a seasoned assurance across a larger canvas. This movie moves with confidence, putting its cast through a series of increasingly diabolical rooms, vividly brought to life by the superb production design. Among the games this round we get acid rain, deadly lasers and crackling arcs of electricity and it is absolutely dazzling to behold (one sequence involving a beach and a lighthouse is particularly clever and intense)\n\nThe cast is excellent, just like the last time. Russel and Miller are superb and continue to be a compelling team worth cheering for. There's a natural chemistry between the two and the friendship they share onscreen seems genuine and unforced. The newcomers are also entertaining to watch, particularly Holland Roden as Rachel, a woman about whom we eventually learn some very interesting facts.\n\nWhile all of those elements contribute to making this sequel work as well as it does, the real reason I enjoyed Tournament of Champions so much is the same as why I enjoyed its predecessor: The focus here is again on the characters and how they work together. The concept of them all being champions isn't a mere hook, either. Establishing early on these characters were smart and strong enough to survive all of this before makes it easier to accept they are capable of solving some of the riddles they're presented as quickly as they manage. After all, these are the best. It wouldn't make sense to repeat the original and have them stumbling around as they figure out what's going on. The film benefits from this decision, allowing it to get to the core action fairly quickly without sacrificing common sense.\n\nEven better, this sequel actually expands the lore. I've read a series of reviews claiming this movie breaks its own rules but that's inaccurate. The rules are not broken, rather our understanding of them is altered through a series of effective, genuinely surprising twists. Revelations are introduced regarding the real nature of what Minos is doing. These new developments are handled well and add a welcome layer to the story.\n\nThe movie ends on a cliffhanger, setting up a third film. As a rule, cliffhangers tend to piss me off a bit â I say make the story self-contained whenever possible â but this one fits so perfectly with the tone and theme of the franchise so far that it worked for me.\n\nOne thing I wasn't a big fan of, though (and this is something the original was also guilty of) is the tendency of characters to shout out what they're seeing or what's happening right in front of our eyes. It doesn't ruin the film or detract from the suspense, but there's no need to have a cast member yell something like \"Hey, the car door just opened\" when everyone â the audience included â clearly saw the damned car door open. One hopes Robitel and his writers stop doing this in the third film.\n\nThat quibble aside, I can enthusiastically report I enjoyed Escape Room: Tournament of Champions every bit as much as I did the original. While I wouldn't say it's a better film, I do think it's equally entertaining and well-crafted. The Escape Room series is rapidly becoming my favorite new film property. What arrived a few years ago as something horror fans derisively labelled \"Saw Lite for tweens\" (Another inaccuracy â these are not kids movies. This new one, in particular, boasts some legitimately gruesome deaths. They're just not gory.) has developed its own identity as it continues to weave its wickedly absorbing narrative.\n\nI sincerely hope this does well enough at the box office to warrant proceeding with that third film. That may be the greatest praise I can give Escape Room: Tournament of Champions: It had this fan exiting the theatre already wanting more.\n\nI think fans of the original will love this as much as I did. I also strongly recommend seeing it on the big screen, where those new rooms are a truly spectacular experience.\n\n**** out of ***** Like its predecessor, Escape Room: Tournament of Champions is a clever, fast-paced blast of suspenseful horror fun.",

There's a particularly good one set in a bank vault with a laser security grid. I thought the characters as well were less obnoxious and more likeable this time around, but you won't be particularly gutted to see any of them killed off. The distinctly sub-par acting also didn't help, I actually laughed at one point because the line delivery was so poor.\n\nIt was weird to see the film open up with a 'previously on Escape Room' recap that you'd expect to see on a TV show, and the ending was just as facepalmingly silly as the first. However, even if the film is utterly ridiculous and pull of plot holes the size of The Grand Canyon, It's a fairly entertaining and enjoyable experience that I'd recommend checking out if you enjoyed the first Escape Room.",

When it's done correctly, it can spawn an inexpensive franchise that can be profitable for Hollywood, while providing an easy fun time for audiences out for an easy and fun time.\n\nEscape Room: Tournament Of Champions, gets the same kind of chemistry right that the first 2019 outing got right and it just might squeeze out a trilogy when its all done with this kind of fizzy energy.\n\nPicking up where the first one left off, Zoey (Taylor Russell), a survivor from the first series of killer challenges from evil mastermind Minos, head to New York where she finds herself trapped with a group of other winners of killer escape rooms for a \"tournament of champions\".\n\nTournament Of Champions barely \"gets it over the net\" because it doesn't let us get bored.\n\nThe suspense gets going and runs for almost the entirety of the swift 1 hour and 28 minute running time. It's a sprint that actually does hook you pretty well despite no character development and a bunch of question marks on what we're actually watching. Director Adam Robitel also delivers on the visuals, getting more mileage off of this wild concept to keep us entertained.\n\nThere are plenty of problems as well.\n\nThe cast can't act. The plot is wildly uneven. And the PG-13 rating here really hurts, as it deprives us of some potentially really gruesome horror moments, in the interest of making a couple of extra bucks. It also pulls material from the first movie it doesn't need. We essentially get a \"Saw\" light with this film.\n\nBut at the end of the movie, I took a breath. And yeah, I was entertained. If the first one got it done for you, I\"m pretty sure this one will too.",

That they're gonna let her walk free after last time?\nWho says it ends when it ends?\nThe rooms are more deadly as the film progresses, the characters are tested to their limits, and the suspense is still very well done \nThere's even a surprise appearance by a familiar face establishing how much control Minos has \nBy the time the ending comes you're also thinking like them, oh it's far from over \nNothings ever too easy when it comes to these escape rooms\nWill there be a part 3?
