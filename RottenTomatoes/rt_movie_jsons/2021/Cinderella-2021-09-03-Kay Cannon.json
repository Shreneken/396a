This movie really was amazing, the romance the fantasy, and all the good magical moments in every scene, I watched this movie like 6 times since last week till' today. And it's really heartwarming how Cinderella no matter how terrible her stepmother and stepsisters treated her, kept pursuing to meet her destination partner, which was Prince Charming, and her Fairy Godmother was very hilarious too, the whole scene with her appearance was just pure amazing!!! *And the cute little mice too*. It was also cute how Eloise Webb was innit too, very cute, it's also very amazing that my favorite Swedish actor Stellan Skarsg√•rd appeared as well!!! Anyways that's too much typing about this movie, hopefully, my review was convincing enough so you all can enjoy such a MASTERPIECE, Peace-Have a wonderful day!!!",

I should know I've watched it three times already!\n\nThis is not exactly like the original Cinderella but who wants the same exact story over and over. This version is fun and I love the little changes. The way they balance the modern day dialogue and songs with the older style and way of living was just fun to watch. They pull off a unique version while still giving nods to the fairytale we all know.  I really like Ella's step family in this version. I know they are supposed to be really mean but it's cool to see the sisters actually care about her. The step mother even cares in her own way and you can tell she truly cares for Ella.  Another thing I really liked about this movie was just how funny it was. Pierce Brosnan's character was ridiculous and very comical.  They put in lighthearted jokes and funny situations but it never felt forced and made the movie a real joy to watch. \n  I knew going in there would be a lot of singing parts but I had no idea the songs would be so well done. Songs like \"Somebody to Love\" by Queen, \"Material Girl\" by Madonna, \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes and more were not only done justice, they were great renditions backed by great vocals. Along with the great songs sprinkled in this movie there are also some original songs that are so catchy you'll be singing them in your sleep. Camila Cabello not only is a great singer but she looked natural as an actress. I don't even want to say for her first movie because she's way better than some that are just actresses. I won't name any names but I'm sure someone popped up in your mind. This movie definitely has some all star singing power but even those who haven't made singing a career are even impressive. \n\nI hope everyone gives this movie a chance and don't just listen to reviews.",

There have been many Cinderella stories told over the years, and the reason why I love this one so much is because it is very upbeat with loads of personality, and it has a refreshingly feminist flavor to it. I love the fact that Ella is not so focused on finding her prince charming, but instead has a dream of being a dress maker. I love the part during the ball when after an edgy number the ladies of the ball perform to \"Whatta Man\", one female performer on stage smashes her bass (Is that the name of the big huge violin that goes between your legs?) in leue of smashing a guitar. So cool! And James Corden as a mouse had me rolling while he excitedly described his experience of suddenly embodying a human being - with hands that clap! \"Humans are so... loud\" I also love how Prince Charming's sister had all sorts of ideas on how to make the kingdom a better place, and has her own dream to some day be queen if the powers that be would allow it. I don't know much about being a movie reviewer, but I do know the difference between a movie that entertains me and gets me to laugh out loud, and a movie that puts me to sleep in about 15 minutes.

Camilla cabello should not quit her day job as a singer cause man she's a bad actor no offense. But literally anybody else could've been Cinderella. The best actor in this is the fairy godmother father? He's great because of \"hush it's magic time\" but besides that one quote everything else is bad. The CGI for the mice or the carriage looks bad.

Cabello's Cinderella is just not the strong independent woman she is advertised as - she is a starry eyed dream girl who floats around waiting for other people to make her dreams come true. The music is comprised of pop songs everyone's already heard a thousand times and original lyrics that frankly make little to no sense. The ending feels sudden and unnatural, with the king's sudden changes of mind, and the story feels off. The dialogue is cringey and the representation is next to nought outside of the dancers and the occasional side character, like the Billy Porter fairy godmother - it feels like he's being used as comic relief or some sort of novel drag queen for the straights to laugh at.",

            "content": "This is such a tough movie to review because it is not blatantly bad, but it also feels like such a missed opportunity. The few redeeming qualities are some of the \"campy\" jokes and a few scenes with interesting directing. The right plot ideas are all here, including new takes on a fairy godmother, the prince's determined/smart sister who wants to rule, a stepmother with a sad story, and Cinderella being ambitious and confident. So, how come the movie failed to execute these ideas properly? The females almost always need a man's help for things to happen, the interesting gender-fluid godmother disappears after the dress scene, and this Cinderella just floats through the movie being awkward and clumsy and that's pretty much it.\n\nThere is just something off about the whole thing, and I think it has to do with the dialogue. It always feels surface level. Some of the failed plot points could have been redeemed if there were better established relationships between the characters. We never get to know the godmother and the prince's sister and friends or see any sort of meaningful connection between, for example, Cinderella with the mice or even just the prince and Cinderella. I mean, they had ONE conversation and then the next day they are singing about how in love they are (which the movie points out, oddly enough). You don't really root for them because there is nothing to base the relationship on. \n\nAlso, the costume design is mostly boring and underwhelming (that was the best they could come up with for Cinderella's ball dress?). The songs were okay, some felt out of place. All of the performances were vocally fine but forgettable. This is unlike, for example, Mamma Mia where I can still replay the performances in my head. The performances here just did not have enough energy to them. It was like everyone wanted to go home.",

But have you ever seen that combined with a jukebox musical?  Now I had heard rumblings about this one.  It has been getting roasted in all corners of the internet, and as we all know, the internet is a ruthless and merciless place.  I had heard all of that, but I still made an active effort to go into this with an open mind.  I'm not about to defend this as a quality film, but I didn't find it to be as dreadful as all of the ridiculing led me to believe.  Now I've never watched Glee, but this is exactly what I imagine that Glee is.  The entire song selection is obtrusive, and whenever a new number launched, I facepalmed about 80% of the time.  This commentary is coming from a person who unabashedly loved Moulin Rouge.  So what gives that movie a pass?  Well, it just felt more organic and artistic, while here, the songs seem like they were pulled by disconnected studio heads who think they know how to appeal to the youth.  This movie is constantly trying too hard, which is its biggest detriment, but you know what?  I always appreciated that they didn't just regurgitate the same film that we've seen 25 times before.  As rocky as this starts, I did warm up to the two leads.  I think that both Camila Cabello and Nicholas Galitzine show a lot of promise, and I can see them both having careers in musical productions after this.  It's the rest of the cast that were lacking.  To rip the Band-Aid off, James Corden is horrendous in this.  He's barely even in it, but he stinks up the screen to the nth degree with his flailing about and yelling.  He has the most horrifying effect with his face getting stuck mid-transformation into a mouse, and it will haunt your dreams.  Billy Porter is okay as the Fabulous Godmother, they just had no idea how to write for him.  Minnie Driver and Pierce Brosnan are professionals, but they don't have a whole lot to do.  I don't think that Idina Menzel walks away from this looking good as the evil stepmother.  She is consistently chewing scenery, and I don't mean that in a good way.  This movie is very much not for me, but I did manage to find those positives that kept me going.  I'm not going to lie, they went a long way, so I do feel that major kudos are due for Cabello and Galitzine.  I'm never going to watch this again, mind you, but when you go into a movie expecting a cataclysmic train wreck, you will feel relief when you find something to latch on to.  There is a very specific audience for this film, but I think even that audience will end up split on this one.",

I'm still recovering from the cringe I got from the few pieces that I suffered through. \n\nSadly, from the get-go, the opening lacks any magic that a Cinderella movie should exude. It's trying so hard to be \"hip,\" but falls faster than an elderly person who has just broken theirs... \n\nMaybe the music would pull me in?... Wrong. \nThat may have been it's saving grace, but even with some powerhouse vocals on the marquee they are not enough to save the sloppy lyrics and well-intended melodies. \n\nGoing back to the music and the actresses that have made the Cinderella franchise what it is, who could possibly compete with **Ilene Woods'** ethereal voice in the original Disney. She was humble, courteous, and sold the part. I still tear up to the live Youtube video of her singing \"A Dream is a Wish\" on the Perry Como show in 1950 to promote the movie. America was fortunate to have **Julie Andrews** live acting the Rodger Hammerstein version in 1957. This was recreated by the contemporary version with **Brandy and Whitney** breathing life back into a classic. Ilene, Julie, and Brandy all were superior to Camilla's arrogant portrayal which had undertones all too common in youth nowadays. Unfortunately for Camilla, the shoe does not fit. \n\nWhen you are competing with Disney and Rodger and Hammerstein (multiple versions), you already have a tough act to follow. Maybe they should have focused more on quality than pushing these millennial-values that has become so abruptly poured on recent pop culture.\n\nI won't comment too much on the Fairy God-They. As he said \"Magic has limits\", and it must have been out of charges or the cauldron was empty when it came to Billy Porter's character. \n\nOverall, I'm disappointed. I'm disappointed that no effort was put into making this magical, appeasing, or entertaining. I'm disappointed that kids are subjected to this catastrophe when there's a myriad of older versions that could enchant them as they did for me when I was a kid. \n\nThinking back to how Disney and Rodgers & Hammerstein must feel; I'd like to quote the 2021 movie for the last ever : \"I will not have you embarrassing this family with your blasphemy.\"",

Most songs really don't mesh with the vibe they're going for and I didn't think the arrangements worked either way. I would have preferred original music or no music at all (just score, obvs). The jukebox style does not suit a story retold multiple times.\nThe goddess that is Idina Menzel  couldn't even save this for me.

(and Mendes certainly looks like a Prince Charming.)\n\nNot that Nicholas Galatzine's performance is lacking -- he's probably the best thing about the entire movie.   He's certainly better than Camilla Cabello, whose limitations as a singer are cruelly exposed here -- she's actually better at the romantic comedy aspect of this \"musical\".   \n\n  Idina Menzel is wasted -- why even hire her if her big number is going to be something as trivial as Madonna's Material Girl?     Billy Porter does exactly what you expect, in exactly the way you expect it to be done -- and at this point, its merely tiresome .  \n\nLike I said, I only got about halfway through the movie (the point where Cinderella gets to the ball).

Did it also feel as if the filmmakers were checking off a checklist instead of being genuine? Also yes unfortunately. I commend the film for trying to be more modern but it also serves as a massive detriment to the film. Instead of taking an issue like climate change seriously, they use it as a joke to ruin the tension of a dramatic moment. There is nothing wrong with making a film talk about modern issues but you have to feel genuine about it instead of forcing it in. There are some modern changes I like. Billy Porter's race and gender swapped Fairy Godmother was a great addition but he's only in the movie for less than 5 minutes. Pierce Brosnan was good and I liked that the film joked about his inability to sing but that was about all I liked. The rest of the film was not good or an absolute train wreck. Like the tone. The tone is all over the place and is often ruined by a misplaced joke and it works as a huge detriment to the characters. Most of the performances are not great. Camila Cabello is a good singer so why did they auto tune her to hell. It's so bad that at points, it is often extremely difficult to understand a word she is saying. James Corden is absolutely awful. It seems that almost every film he is in, the quality of it seems to suffer and it's worse here. All of the characters are often insufferable to watch and that's because the script is awful. The dialogue feels forced and weak and the sequence of events is lackluster and stupid. It doesn't help that this film is an absolute snooze fest for 90% of the runtime. I found it hard to pay attention to. Besides maybe one song, every other song is a modern rendition and they all suck. I tell you that I genuinely laughed when they did Seven Nation Army. All of the technical aspects are unimpressive for an iconic story like this. The cinematography is boring, the lighting is bland but the sets and costumes do look good however. I would highly recommend passing on this and watch the original Disney animated film instead.",

            "content": "IN A NUTSHELL:\nBased on the movie poster, I was prepared to not like this new rendition of the legendary story because Cinderella looked way too cocky to be Cinderella, but as soon as the music started, I was intrigued. My favorite version of the Cinderella story is Cinderella (2015) (Theatrical) with Lily James. She was sooo lovely and perfect in it, giving the film heart, class, and true Disney magic. This iteration of the story, however, has become extremely controversial because of its in-your-face wokeness.\n\nThe synopsis is described by the studio as featuring an ambitious heroine who has big dreams. With the help of her fab Godmother, she perseveres to make them ome true. This new take on the classic story was both written and directed by the boundary-pushing Kay Cannon. One of my guilty-pleasure franchises is Pitch Perfect, which she also wrote. This is Columbia Picture's first exclusive Amazon Studios film.\n\nTHINGS I LIKED:\nCamila Cabello has a beautiful voice and did an excellent job in the title role. I've read several reviews that trashed her but I thought she was a breath of fresh air and even had some comedic chops. I really enjoyed her modern take on this epic figure in Disney history. She made some controversial comments many years ago that some critics are bringing up, but I simply judged her performance in this piece.\n\nThe talented cast also includes Nicholas Galitzine, the fantastic Idina Menzel, Pierce Brosnan, Minnie Driver, Billy Porter, and James Corden.\nJames Corden helped to produce the film, yet only has a few scenes in the story. For some reason, there is a lot of hate flying his way, but I actually get a kick out of him.\nTake a look at Nicholas Galitzine's mouth, especially when he sings. Doesn't it kind of remind you of Freddy Mercury's mouth?\nWhen is Minnie Driver going to start aging? She looks great!\nIsn't every movie better when Idina Menzel sings in it? Yes. The answer is yes.\nLots of humor, both spoken and visual. I laughed out loud many times.\nThe set designs are beautiful. The majority of the film was shot in the famous Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. Several scenes were also filmed in Waddesdon Manor and Lancashire in Blackpool. Several years ago, I got to visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Blenheim Palace where I learned I actually have ancestors who lived there! I slipped and fell on one of the gravel pathways at the entrance, cutting a huge gash in my knee. You could say that place is in my blood. I still have a big scar from my time there.\nReally fun dance numbers.\nBilly Porter is \"fabulous\", although I know many people will really hate seeing the fairy godmother portrayed as he does.\nThe town crier, played by Doc Brown, offers a Hamilton-like vibe to the musical when he sings.\nThis is the first time we see comedians James Acaster and Romesh Ranganathan in a movie.\nThe costume that Cinderella wears at the beginning of the movie is the same one Lily James wore in her 2015 Cinderella film, except it's a different color.\nBeautiful costume design. The only time I was worried was when Cinderella wore her ball gown. It was beautiful but I worried that it might fall off her.\n\nTHINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nA lot of viewers are complaining that they don't like being lectured to during the entire movie and that it feels more like a political agenda than entertainment.\nCinderella throws her glass slipper at someone and it doesn't break.\nWhatever happened to a sense of duty and respect? The message feels like they're telling our young girls to be self-centered and to ignore their responsibilities if they don't like them.\nA lot of the singing is auto-tuned. In some cases, it's really obvious when the voices don't match the audio.\nSome of the song choices were spot on; others seemed a bit odd.\nWho is the villain in this story? Even the \"Evil\" stepmother isn't evil, just not that nice. The story really softens her personality and makes her just seem misunderstood.\n\nTIPS FOR PARENTS:\nThis is the first time we see the fairy godmother as non-binary...and a butterfly.\nA conversation about how a mouse/man pees through his \"front tail.\" Cringe.\nNo profanity, except using God's name in vain.\n\"Progressive\" messaging to young girls.\n\nYou can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel.",

I wish this was more like theatre production, original, not like a Disney High School Musical production. Same with Camilla Carbello- she is stunning and has a beautiful distinctive voice, so let her use it. Its her first acting role and she was great. I feel this film has a lot of screeching and wining in it's music, no lip sync either. Why also are there not many original songs? I would have preferred more classical/original musical approach. It would have been much better-maybe this version is more for under 10s. The costumes are colourful, scenery are lovely however. The animation is also good. I couldn't keep watching this over and over again. Once is enough. It is diverse and encompasses everybody, nationalities, body shape etc etc which is good and why I give it 2‚òÜ, but the music was the worse thing about this film, all dubbed and the same screeching.",

All of the characters have a story arc and it is a necessary update for the 21st century. The message of choosing oneself and fighting for your dreams is so important. This Cinderella does not wait for anyone to save her and her intentions to go to the ball isn't to meet the prince. Even the prince isn't your conventional prince and he himself goes through a transformation. You inspire me is the new \"I love you\". Such a fun movie for the family, would highly recommend it. Camila does an an amazing job for her first film, her comedic timing is impeccable and you feel everything she does. Billy Porter is amazing, you just want more of him. Idina is absolutely incredible as the stepmother and you understand why she does what she does. The narrative for evil and good is abandoned instead people are the way they are because of the life story. Given the increase in blended families, I'm glad we're seeing the removal of evil step sisters and step mother. Overall would highly recommend those who love musicals and with kids to watch it. The musical mash ups will introduce kids to another generation of music.",

Her stepsisters who were just as evil and abusive mockingly nicknamed her \"Cendrillon\" (Cinderella). She beared the torment patiently and never told her father, who would have scolded her. He wasn't a good father to her either and always away. Due the mistreatment she never got the chance to have dreams, to make friends outside of her animals, see the world and just wanted to enjoy one night in freedom and for herself. There she happened to catch the eyes of a prince who fall in love with her. But that's not good enough, no. She needed fixing bc she didn't leave on her own which any abuse victim will tell you is difficult and for a accepting a helping hand escaping hell. \n\nThroughout everything she stayed strong, never gave up and remained compassionate, forgiving, gracious and kind. Sadly traits that often are deemed as 'weaknesses' by modern standard.\n\nHonestly she's more feminist than this version will ever be.",

            "content": "Do we need another rendition of good ole' Cinderella, especially only a few years after the Disney live-action version? The new Cinderella starring pop star Camila Cabello is a surprise jukebox musical, and it's irreverent where it should be and progressive where social critiques are warranted with the source and historical context. In short, it's a fleeting but fun experience that's a winning 100 minutes for families with young children and adults who enjoy a peppy, self-referential musical. Written and directed by Kay Cannon (Pitch Perfect), this movie is packed with singing and dancing to the point that the talking only makes up perhaps twenty percent of the movie. This choice proves to be a durable source of energy and keeps the pacing running smooth. It's also convenient because we don't need extra time explaining the setup and character dynamics that we're all so familiar with at this point thanks to the umpteenth renditions. The mash-up of popular songs kept me amused and guessing what would appear next, and the original songs contributed by Cabello have a nice soaring uplift to them as well as memorable hooks. There's a \"What a Man\"/\"Seven Nation Army\" mashup at a ball that gave me strong Moulin Rouge vibes, especially with all that chaotic sashaying petticoat editing. The movie is also funnier than I expected, with consistent wise-cracking and one-liners that had me laughing and critiques about the patriarchal system from a progressive, feminist perspective. The evil stepmother, played by Idina Menzel (Frozen), is even given her own song detailing her tragic history of being a musical prodigy who had to give it all up in a society that only valued her as marriage material. Even she gets consideration and empathy. The winking feminist criticisms won't be new to anyone over the age of twelve, but it's still welcomed even as the film skates over the discordant plot elements to keep things light. The film delivers some bon mots of political thought to go along with its sugary sweetness of a contemporary sing-a-long musical that is easy to digest. Cabello has a natural charisma to her and is surprisingly adept with comedy, able to turn on a dime and deliver a hilarious self-effacing remark. She's far better at acting than you might believe. If you have no interest in another version of Cinderella, I understand the fatigue with the property. However, this Cinderella understands your fatigue, provides something light and airy, with actors who seem to be legitimately having fun, and it's got a consistent feminist perspective that chides the prevalent problems with the source material. It works as a family film and even as a diverting jukebox musical for adults whose tastes run a little sweet and a little tart.\n\nNate's Grade: B",

The only purpose of this film boarders on narcissism of all characters and their need for greed.  Even Cinderella (who is supposed to be the endearing character, depicted as someone who creates fashion in the basement of her house all day, doesn't ring true to any real \"conflict\" or real \"longing\" and it's certainly not the story of Charles Perrault's \"Cendrillon\",  later adapted by Grimm's Fairy tales, (or any other historical application of this folktale which goes so far back it's impossible to find it's original origin; example:  \"Wang Po Po\" where the story may have originated in China).   \n\nThis version is about \"me\", \"money\", \"land grabbing\", \"attention seeking\" and basically is trying to play off the popularity of reusing songs people know (unlike well done earlier versions of movies that created this concept  first  with \"Knight's Tale\" which pulled off this concept of injecting popular songs in a fresh way to move the story along mixing worlds of the old and new).   The attempt to \"modernize\" Cincerella fails.   There is no story.  The background of the pathos of Cinderella is lost, the prince knows who she is prior to the ball so the whole aspect of the palace's guards to find the right girl with the glass slipper, doesn't exist. A story needs to have basic elements in it;  a heroine you care about, the hero who takes on the task of trying to find her (or him, not being gender specific) they miss each other in some way, and the hero's journey begins;  usually fraught with danger of some kind, a triangulation in love story, or a LOSS of some kind being avoided. In the end through trials he/she faces, they change so that the object of finding becomes available to them through their transformation.  This requires emotion that the audience can understand.

And poor James Corden, not having learned his lesson from \"Cats,\" for some reason decided to accept another role with whiskers -- this time he plays a mouse. Cabello's Ella here doesn't yearn to become a princess as much as she wants to win \"Project Runway.\" Yes, she's got the hots for Nicholas Galitzine's mannequin-handsome Prince Robert, but true love is not going to get in the way of her dream of designing dresses. The whole effort seems like it was thought up in a laboratory on Disney's Main Street USA instead of bursting from the imagination of a genuine talent.",

            "content": "A modern, musical take on the evergreen fairy tale, Cinderella's impeccable sets and wardrobe, as well as its talented cast make this production a one-of-a-kind watch.\n\nCinderella follows the story of Ella (Camilla Cabello), a poor orphan who lives with her abusive, restrictive stepmother Vivian (Idina Menzel) and her mean, obnoxious and spoiled stepsisters (Maddie Baillio, Charlotte Spencer). She loves to design dresses and even has her own workplace in her basement, where a crew of merry mice (James Corden, Romesh Ranganathan, James Acaster) watch over her. It is her dream is to open up a dress shop in the town marketplace; however, in her kingdom, women cannot run businesses. When Prince Robert (Nicholas Galitzine), the unassuming heir apparent, lays eyes on Ella, he falls head over heels in love with her, as does she for him. However, as Cinderella and Prince Robert find themselves and their paths in life, a series of decisions they must take puts their love story in jeopardy. There are lots of subplots and side stories in the film, but that's the main plotline.\n\nCinderella maintains a steady and engaging pace with just enough action, comedy, romance and drama throughout the nearly two-hour duration. As it's told through a combination of songs and dialogue, it's only logical that the cast is comprised of a mixture of singers, actors, and comedians. Camila Cabello, Billy Porter and Idina Menzel \"slay\" in the film, as Porter's character (Ella's fairy godparent) would say. Their delivery is clear and, in the case of Cabello and Menzel, though a lot of the film's soundtrack is comprised of remakes (like Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation); it's refreshing to hear their take on the songs. Pierce Brosnan plays the stately, confident, yet flawed and patriarchal King Rowan and Minnie Driver acts as his strong, regal Queen Beatrice. I love the portrayal of strong women in the film. Beatrice, Ella and even Vivian have one thing in common - they are restricted by their society. Vivian had to give up on her passion; Beatrice must sit silently next to her husband for life; and Ella is at risk of losing her dreams. It's certainly unique to see this struggle in a fairy tale film. Shot at Pinewood Studios in the UK, the film's sets are impeccable, and I truly felt I was in a medieval kingdom with the characters.\n\nCinderella promotes advocating for yourself, pushing against restrictive gender roles, following your dreams, choosing your own destiny and so many more positive messages! There are only one or two uses of mild profanity in this film.\n\nI give Cinderella 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this for ages 11 to 18, plus adults. Reviewed by Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!",

She and Nicholas Galitzine who plays Prince Robert have amazing chemistry on screen. In fact, the entire cast made up of such heavy-weights as Idina Menzel, Billy Porter, Minnie Driver and Pierce Brosnan deliver brilliant performances. It's funny, entertaining throughout with some great musical numbers, and surprisingly captivating. I like director Kay Cannon's fresh take on the story, giving each character more depth and updating the values of this old fairy tale to make it relevant to young people today like my daughters.

            "content": "Let me start out by saying I did indeed come into this with an open mind. I like fairytales, musicals, Idina Menzel, etc. I don't prefer Camila because she has been problematic but I set that aside for two hours. But oh Camila... I honestly tried and yet she made it the movie so much worse. She overacted and her weird quirky lines were really embarrassing and over the top... not funny. Also her weirdly dramatic and overdone sappy singing just didn't suit the film. I was embarrassed for her singing with Idina. I'm certain that her stans are just padding the reviews because really truly without her name this just wasn't good. Smart on Amazon to use star power, her fans will watch it regardless. But come on how can you objectively say this was good???\n\nThis was so horrible we ended up skipping large hunks. So much needless and boring backstory. It blatantly rips off famous successes & pop culture every scene (in the heights, hamilton, black & gay culture, every cinderella remake ever, mamma mia, pop culture, moulin rouge etc) to try and be relatable and quirky. But somehow it's still bad!!! You could see how it could've been done well but it just wasn't. The mix of corny and bad original songs with classic pop songs was not it. When we watched it was 2 stars so the sudden increase in rating is sketchy. Only Idina Menzel was worth watching and if I were her I would be frankly offended to be cast as an old women among largely sub par actors / singers like Camila when they didn't even have Camila showcasing her voice. Like shoot I know Camila can sing! You gotta give her that. But it just didn't sound good. Also y'all really tried to recreate havana at the end??\n\nAlso is the theme pro women empowerment or is it love fixes everything bc it tried to do both... it tried so hard to be PC and yet still was offensive by ripping off POC artist's work and culture to seem trendy. I really appreciate a feminist message but this was so effortful and overdone. Did y'all really have a black woman essentially allude to yass i'm a black queen! But like they literally said yaass! (?!?!) and other cultural slang...\n\nOn top of this, they rip off other cinderella remakes - '97 brandy remake witch this one's use of black side characters (of course no MCs) & ones who in this one said she killed people to get there or something??. Another one ripped off was ella enchanted (quirky sisters & somebody to love) as well as literally every other of the dozen cinderella remakes.\n\nThis was so painful to watch... at one point my mom said \"I know this is Cinderella but also what's happening?\" Which plot line to follow? Also the lines were just so so bad.\n\nAnd then this girl is supposed to be a dressmaker and her dresses are SO UGLY. Then she decides to be a Career Women but says love solves everything??? Then pulled a mamma mia and went and travelled with her guy instead of getting married?? After accepting a job??? This was so bad. Not enough review space! Avoid bc you can't even hate watch because it's boring. I'm sorry Camila stans, maybe she would be good in something else but this was bad.",

Sure - the messaging of an entrepreneurial girl-boss Cinderella, hustling in a medieval patriarchy is overtly pandering and formulaic, but it's done with good humour and self-awareness.

            "content": "Leave your glass slippers at the door when you step inside the world of Kay Cannon's sassy take on the classic Cinderella tale!  Although the basics are all there - Cinderella, played with great heart and impeccable comic timing in a brilliant debut by award-winning singer songwriter Camila Cabello, the wicked stepmother given multi-dimensional life by Idina Menzel, the stepsisters who are not so ugly in either looks or personality but add some funny moments thanks to Maddie Baillio and Charlotte Spencer, Prince Robert who is given a bit more personality here thanks to Nicolas Galitzine and in this version we have the impeccable Billy Porter as a gender neutral Fabulous Godmother. New to the cast are Pierce Brosnan as King Rowan, a King a little too invested in his own Kingliness, and Minnie Driver as his Queen who teaches him a wee lesson in humility and love, along with their younger child, the ambitious Princess Gwen (Tallulah Greive). Together with some great modern tunes including originals from Menzel and most especially the beautiful \"Million To One\" from Ms Cabello (sure to get a nod come Oscar time, and definitely sung non-stop by young girls everywhere), great choreography and stunning costumes that might garner \"Bridgerton\" designer Ellen Mirojnick an Oscar nomination herself, what we have here is a fun and joyous romp that is going straight into my replay list. It's sure to bring me up when I'm feeling down with it's central love story (with a twist), hilarious comedic moments from everyone (Cabello, Driver and Brosnan had me laughing out loud, and there were a few cute moments from the mice footmen - one is played by producer James Corden - not to mention Porter who steals his scenes although Cabello holds her own in their musical collaboration). It's a feel good movie that deserves a watch or two or three. If you liked Pitch Perfect, Glee, and the old parody fairy tales from the 90s you'll love it, and even if these are not your usual genre, do yourself a favour and give yourself over to the world of Cinderella, where the titular character is an aspiring dress designer who chooses herself over love (in fact all the women in this movie have a lesson for us to learn), where the Princess calls her brother 'Dude' and a butterfly bursts out of it's cocoon to create magic, which is a fitting metaphor for Ms Cabello and the film itself. My favourite movie this year. I'm off to listen to the soundtrack right now. Anything with a Whatta Man - Seven Nation Army mashup is worth a relisten or ten don't you think?",

There is a bit more focus on more progressive themes in this version, but I was okay with it since at least it made the movie different. I also think the main reason I found enjoyment in this movie was because of the music. The songs were admittedly catchy and helped the movie move at a good pace. That being said, the writing and acting is pretty hit or miss, which kept the movie inconsistent. I think Camila Cabello does her best, but its clear singing is her talent and that's what makes the movie enjoyable. There are attempts at humor that work well but there are also some jokes that feel very forced. Overall, it is a flawed movie, but the songs and experience of watching some great vocalists perform them along with high energy throughout make it a perfectly acceptable form of entertainment for musical fans like myself.",
