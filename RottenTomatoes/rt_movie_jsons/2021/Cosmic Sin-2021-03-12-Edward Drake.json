Retired Military General James Ford (Willis) is called back into service after soldiers on a remote planet are attacked by a hostile alien fleet. The threat against the human race escalates into an inevitable interstellar war. General Ford teams up with General Eron Ryle (Grillo) and a team of elite soldiers in a race to stop the imminent attack before it is too late.",

Shoot people through space like BULLETS!  Because who needs space ships?  Launching people faster than light like missiles makes no sense.  To quote the great Crow T. Robot, \"Just because it looks futuristic doesn't make it practical.\"  Lastly the aliens that they are so quite to kill without any provocation.  They are generic and cheap parasitic goop.  I wish Netflix would be a little more discriminating on what they green light.  Because last 5 years or so, there has been a ton of shit being made.",

Some many things in the movie just don't make sense or seems nonsensical. Like why in 2524 are people still driving cars from the 21st century? Why did the survivors need to walk through the base passing by many soldiers before they could be decontaminated? Why was Bruce's ex wife walking on top of the alien ship and what the heck was that orb thing? There were just so many dumb scenes and god awful dialog. Some of the action scenes seem to be copied from other better movies. If this is the quality of the movies Bruce Willis is doing now that he's in his 60's, I think he shoudl retire.",

The costumes were clearly made of cardboard. Next the camera work and editing were so bad that you couldn't tell who was talking to each other. They were likely being filmed remotely. Finally, characters would just appear like the little girl with sunglasses or the old couple with flannel shirts out of nowhere for no particular reason.  The fight scenes were hilarious. Let's find the cleaning lady and her husband and throw them into the fight with no armor and a gun to get killed then the main guy can fight the aliens off with a knife. \n\nThis movie might become a cult classic just because you can't stop talking about how bad it is.

This is about a group of rogue soldiers launching a preemptive strike to try and stop an intergalactic war before it starts.  Now I didn't know much about this one other than it the fact that it is the latest in the series of movies where Bruce Willis shows up to collect a paycheck.  Needless to say, I did not have high expectations for this, and the fact that this is currently rated lower on IMDb than Hard Kill made me assume I was in for the worst.  You can already make an educated guess for yourself on where this is going, and there is no point in pretending otherwise: there is nothing here to recommend.  Now I knew that I was in trouble as soon as this started.  They give you a rundown of CENTURIES of science fiction lore within the opening minute like you know what they are referencing.  You can tell that somebody clearly had big ideas at some point in this process, but you can also tell that the majority of this budget had to have gone to Bruce Willis.  This is what his career has become.  It's not like you have to pay for an advertisement budget here.  This and majority of his recent library exist solely for people browsing Redbox or scrolling a streaming service, and when they happen upon his face, they'll say, \"Hey, I like Bruce Willis.\"  He's sleepwalking through this, and at this point in his career, that is all you're likely going to get from him.  All of the actors here are amateurish at best with the one exception of Frank Grillo, and even he doesn't walk away from this looking good since he gets no energy reciprocated back to him.  Because all of the production money went to Bruce Willis, every aspect of this movie ends up looking cheap.  The war suits look like garbage cans, and you don't get a good look at the alien threat until the midpoint.  For a while there, I thought that they exist entirely off-screen when they aren't pulling the cheap option of having aliens mind control humans.  That would have been a better call to make because when you finally do get to see the enemy, they are just faceless men in hoodies, which is just comical.  Much like all of the characters here, this is a movie that has no personality.  You don't get to know what any of these people are about other than the fact that Bruce Willis committed war crimes, and all of the actors are just going through the motions.  I can't blame them since this script is nothing but a collection of clichés.  I am not exaggerating when I say that the phone app for Star Realms has a better story with their opening preludes than what they put together here.  Cosmic Sin never offended me to the point of being angry, but it did offend my sense of taste.  You should go out of your way to actively avoid this.",

There was an extreme lack of continuity, and scenes that had no meaning, or if the meanings were hidden, I'm sure the smugly smiling writers didn't even know really.

If you have an idea of a SciFi movie in your head then congratulations....its already better than this. Then put some Philips Hue bulbs on an abandoned factory, get a friend with a nice leather jacker to hold a Nerf Gun he's painted silver and have him slowly chase you through nearby woodland shouting how he's going to destroy Earth and congratulations....your sequel is now better than Cosmic Sin.\nThis is a movie for the Covid generation. Keep your distance, wear a full face covering if you suspect someone has a copy and if they do get close isolate from this movie for at least 14 decades. \nIt's 2021 but someone made a movie that's going straight to Betamax.",
