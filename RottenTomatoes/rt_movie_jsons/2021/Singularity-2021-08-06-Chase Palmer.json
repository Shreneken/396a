    "summary": "Naked Singularity tells the story of Casi (John Boyega), a promising young NYC public defender whose idealism is beginning to crack under the daily injustices of the very justice system he's trying to make right. Doubting all he has worked for and seeing signs of the universe collapsing all around him, he is pulled into a dangerous high-stakes drug heist by an unpredictable former client (Olivia Cooke) in an effort to beat the broken system at its own game.",

        {
            "content": "Loved the cast but the movie itself was just ok. I wish they had spent more time on the sci fi aspect of the movie and explored that a little more. Decent movie and good watch but lacked anything worth remembering.",

        {
            "content": "It is quite a quirky story, with acceptable acting all around. The movie is neither really good nor bad, just an oddball of characters who seem to have no real connection to each other to eventually fall in in line. It's not a complete waste of time, but if you miss out on this one your life will surely continue without any damage, just as well.",
