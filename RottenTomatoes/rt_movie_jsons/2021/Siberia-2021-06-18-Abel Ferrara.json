    "summary": "Clint is a damaged man who has retreated to a wintry remote mountain cabin where he hopes to find serenity. He runs a modest caf√© where the rare traveler or native of the region visits. But even in his relative isolation he cannot find peace nor escape. On a fateful evening, to confront himself, he begins a journey by dogsled to the world he once knew. He travels through dreams, memory and imagination in an attempt to find his true nature.",

            "content": "I gather that Clint for some reason undervalued the love and care that the people in his life showed him, all the while surmising that his problem was that he \"loved too much.\"  His memories of why he abandoned people were horribly delusional.  He chose a life of solitude, but did not choose to make it complete. In the end, he lost everything, or gained a new beginning?",

The wasteland is more interesting to look at than the psychological unravelling of the main character who, at the end of the film, I still had no real understanding of.  The landscape photography raised my rating by one star.",

There are definite echoes of the Mexican bardo film \"Vera.\"",

            "content": "God bless Willem Dafoe, an actor that I believe is constantly challenging his fans and himself, with material that tries to make everyone a better thinking consumer of films. It's like he's speaking an alien language, that if you can unlock, will give you a next level appreciation of the craft.\n\nSometimes its a haunting vision like \"Antichrist\". Other times, it's a beautiful enigma like \"The Light House\".\n\nUnfortunately, \"Siberia\" is neither, as it just stumbles down the path consisting of a frustrating glob of experiences.\n\nDafoe stars as Clint. A man who is searching for his soul. Everywhere. In a cave. In a tavern. On a dogsled speeding through the snow. This movie doesn't really have any borders. And all along the way he's challenged with visions and riddles as he tries to recover the missing part of himself.\n\nIt makes no sense. It doesn't want to. And that results in a poor experience.\n\nThe movie just drifts from scene to scene. Some are gory. Some are sexual. Others are completely out of place. There is no rhyme or reason here. You are given a box of different parts from different machines, ranging from a super computer to a can opener and told to \"build something\" with it. There is nothing to build.\n\nIt's an art house movie. But I've said it time and time again. Art house films have to make you feel something or provide an answer to an equation. Director Abel Ferrara has been around so long, he probably didn't believe he was required to do that. To say something positive about the film, Dafoe gives us everything. Like he normally does.\n\nBut this time, it's for nothing",
