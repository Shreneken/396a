    "summary": "Seventeen-year-old Ruby (Emilia Jones) is the sole hearing member of a deaf family -- a CODA, child of deaf adults. Her life revolves around acting as interpreter for her parents (Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur) and working on the family's struggling fishing boat every day before school with her father and older brother (Daniel Durant). But when Ruby joins her high school's choir club, she discovers a gift for singing and soon finds herself drawn to her duet partner Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo). Encouraged by her enthusiastic, tough-love choirmaster (Eugenio Derbez) to apply to a prestigious music school, Ruby finds herself torn between the obligations she feels to her family and the pursuit of her own dreams.",

            "content": "Si\u00e2n Heder brings a powerful story to the screen with her Sundance breakout. Apple's history-making $25 million dollar purchase from the Sundance Film Festival brings together a sensational ensemble and a well-written screenplay. Showcasing stellar performance from its entire cast \u2018CODA' is a touching film that shines a light on the deaf community. Adapted from the French film \u2018The B\u00e9lier Family', Heder's film rectifies one of its predecessor's many faults by casting actual deaf actors in the roles of deaf characters. As well as its record-breaking price tag, \u2018CODA' has gone on to win a plethora of awards such as, 3 Academy Awards at the 94th Oscars, including Best Picture, 2 SAG awards and 2 BAFTAs. The film is the first feature with a predominantly deaf cast to win Best Picture, and Troy Kotsur is the first deaf actor to win a BAFTA.\n\n\u2018Locke & Key' star Emilia Jones stars in the film's lead role, bringing the character of Ruby Rossi to the screen, a Massachusetts teenager who happens to be the only hearing person in her deaf family (brought to life by brilliant performances from Marlee Matlin and Daniel Durant and a sensational performance from Troy Kotsur). Ruby must work to juggle high school, working on her family's fishing boat and her new commitment to the school choir. When singing becomes a passion for Ruby she's faced with the decision to apply for Berklee College of Music; Ruby finds herself at a crossroads \u2013 leave her family and follow her dreams or stay in Gloucester, Massachusetts, and continue to work in the family business.\n\nThe film features electric performances from its entire cast while giving audiences an insight into a community more-or-less forgotten about by society \u2013 showing viewers how, even in a crowded room, deaf people can feel isolated. Troy Kotsur's Oscar, BAFTA and SAG award-winning performance is arguably the standout part of \u2018CODA', with his only spoken line being enough to draw audiences to tears. Emilia Jones' performance is equally marvellous, her performances brilliantly show audiences what it's like to be in her position as a CODA (child of deaf adults), acting a both interpreter and daughter at times. \u2018CODA' is a film not entirely dissimilar to Darius Marder's 2019 drama \u2018Sound of Metal' starring Riz Ahmed and real-life CODA Paul Raci. Both films heavily revolve around deafness and being deaf, and each happened to be nominated for Best Picture, with \u2018CODA' going onto win the distinguished accolade.\n\nDespite coming off as a child-friendly coming-of-age drama, \u2018CODA' quickly grows on you as the film progresses, turning from a clich\u00e9 film into an emotional, heart-warming tear-jerker. \u2018Pam & Tommy's Paula Huidobro provides the film with pleasant visuals that make \u2018CODA' all the more enjoyable to watch. Heder's eloquent screenplay skilfully walks the line between comedy and drama that is thoroughly entertaining and carefully pulls you into its powerful story. The film cleverly balances themes and ideas that some may not be all that familiar with ones that are more known to mainstream/hearing audiences, taking those things and transforming them into a dynamic and feel-good film that you can easily get behind. Emilia Jones also lends her voice to the film's soundtrack, providing vocals for six songs featured throughout the film, including a passionate cover of Joni Mitchell's 1969 song \u2018Both Sides Now'.\n\nSi\u00e2n Heder's Oscar-winning adaptation tells a story that resonates with CODAs across the globe and builds a bridge between deaf and hearing audiences through uplifting storytelling and knockout performances. \u2018CODA' tells the tale of a teen torn between two lives as she struggles to make her way in the world. Despite being a formulaic film in which you can easily predict what's going to happen next, Si\u00e2n Heder manages to create something that greatly succeeds in being a stirring familial affair set to stand the test of time as feel-good crowd pleaser.",

But we are where we are, and Hollywood has once again shown that fans of good movies should not count on it in the future.\n\nThere is no need to say anything more about this film, except the recommendation that, if you are interested in such an interesting topic, watch the original. On the other hand, the only bright spot in this bad copy is the acting of Eugenio Derbez, who is the only one who stands out with his interesting interpretation of the role of music professor.\n\nAs for the events in the awards night, it will be noted that Will Smith won the Oscar for Best Actor for a very average role in the below-average film \"King Richard\", but I guess according to Hollywood criteria it was time for his turn, so we have to take that fact for granted. In any case, as someone has noticed before, he is at least the most talented for acting within his family.\n\nAlso, Hollywood, whose ratings has long been lowered to the extreme, used the opportunity to spice up this evening with elements of a reality show, in the form of a poorly played slap. It is hard to resist the impression that the award should have been taken away from the main actor immediately, not because of some violence (because there was no violence at all), but only because of bad acting.\n\nAll in all, the film industry has not been on the lower branches for a long time.

That's not to say the deaf members always leaned on the non-deaf daughter.  She needed their support just as much as they needed her...just in differing ways.

It was a complete role reversal as she was always supporting them through everything they needed, and they showed up for her when she was having a struggle.

You'd have to figure out what the deaf characters are 'saying.' And I tried it - without the subtitles - and it worked for me. It was like watching a silent movie. It added a lot to the movie - it made it special - a movie about a deaf family and, like them, you had to figure out what people were 'saying' throw their body language. The acting was good enough to do that- all top notch, even if a little over the top. \nBut even that great idea would not have saved this movie from mediocrity. The problem is the story line - it's very trite. The problems raised by the plot are not real. There are so many simple solutions to these 'problems' that I couldn't understand why they didn't discover them - these people are deaf but they still are smart. Need a speaking member of the crew on the fishing boat? Hire one. It's not like that is a problem. Oh, but then how will the hearing person deal with the deaf father and son on board the boat? Well, the deaf son/brother meets a girl in a bar and they communicate very well by texting to each other. Sounds like a solution.  You can even turn on the vibrate function so you won't miss any messages. \nThe subplot about how the government is ruining the livelihood of the fishermen is just plain ridiculous. And the idea that this family - so poor that Mom worries about a $2 purchase - could afford to start a co-op and rent a warehouse - it's just silly. OK, that's the story and I can accept it. But just don't make it so silly.\nOf course, the real story is about how a family copes with a child who is about to leave the nest. Yes, it is hard. And while the family is poor the story throws in a 'rich boy' character to say that while the family in question is poor, they love each other and laugh, as opposed to his rich but sad family. Really? \nYes, telling the story of a deaf family using deaf actors is a great idea, but please, do it honestly.",

It is many of those things; it is also often genuinely funny and insightful. A film that breaks this many barriers and thus holds the level of significance it does should probably be a bit more than that, however. That most of the narrative beats of the film are entirely predictable is a shame, but it's also true that several good performances do elevate it to a degree. A brilliant use of sound dropping away in a music performance scene gives to hearing audience members the most profound moment of empathy in the film; there are other moments, and sequences that hit home in their own way. Emilia Jones' singing voice is something special too, it's not hard to see her career taking a distinctly musical direction from here on out. Ultimately it has more to recommend it than other similar films, and its heart is undoubtedly in a good place. But it also could, and perhaps should, have been more too.",

The parents in this film are truly evil and sadistic. Both of them are deaf and yet they had two children, knowing that they could inherit their curse. The protagonist is the lucky one, meanwhile her poor brother must go through his entire life never hearing music or the sound of his sister's voice. The film makes it clear that deafness is a tragic handicap that makes it much harder for someone to earn a living, have a social life, and communicate with anyone who isn't deaf. The mother actually tells her child that she wished she had been born deaf so that she  would love her more. Seriously. The family earns their money in a barbaric fashion by casting wide nets into the ocean, dragging up all forms of sea life such as fish and crabs. They are then left to painfully die out of water and stabbed mercilessly by the father as he sorts them. He teaches his daughter to step on the fish as they lay dying to fit more into some buckets. Without their daughter the father and brother cannot run a fishing business. They won't hear coast guard alerts. They won't hear the cries of anyone in trouble. So they rely on their daughter, who can hear, to help them. That is the conflict of the story. The ending is predictable and yet fails to wrap up the conflict. There is additional conflict between the protagonist and her chorus teacher, her duet partner, and a school admissions board. It tries to be a heartwarming film, but the parents are so beyond belief in their cruelty to animals and to their daughter that I felt no sympathy for them at all.",

I've seen plenty of films that have deaf characters but I've never seen something that dives into that life the way this film did. We get to see all of the complications that come with being deaf and it really opens your eyes and makes you think about what it would be like.\n\nEmilia Jones plays the lead character Ruby Rossi and does an amazing job. You become extremely invested in this character fairly early on so throughout the entire film you are rooting for her and you feel the emotions she feels when dealing with her parents that can't really understand her passion for music.\n\nOn the other side of this film we see her family who are trying as hard as they can to live a comfortable life. Troy Kostar is phenomenal in his role. His ability to act and display emotion without speaking is something I've never seen before. Daniel Durant and Marlee Martin are both amazing butt Troy is the stand out for me.\n\nThis was also extremely funny in my opinion. There are moments that are fairly cheesy but overall they did a great job of making this film not only compelling and emotionally gripping but also entertaining.\n\nOverall CODA is an amazing film. It gives us a coming of age story that we've seen before but adds to it with the deep dive into the life of being the only hearing person in her family.\n\n9/10.",

However, having spent a career as an ASL interpreter, then later a counselor I shared the stage with many CODAs and advocated for independence and equity for countless deaf families and individuals since 1983. This is where this movie falls flat, it appears to be contemporary setting, but there is no way in 2020s that there would be town meetings, school plays, Coast Guard hearings without a certified interpreter, especially in a coastal Massachusetts town!!! Deaf families are not that dependent or helpless these days. Place this movie pre-ADA 1990, in a rural town in Maine and it would be more believable. Because, yes deaf people experience the level of discrimination depicted in this poignant film, and children of deaf adults have lived through many embarrassing appointments or been bullied and torn between living their dreams or their family's. \nFinal note: Emilia Jones has a fabulous voice and mastered ASL WHILE SINGING!!! You have to literally think in two different languages at the same time. Now, Eugenio Derbez was right out of the passionate-choral-director-living-his lost-dreams-through-students playbook. As an seasoned vocalist, I have worked with and been equally inspired by a Mr V and found his character a fantastic addition to this well developed cast.

Marlee Matlin, the actress, talks. Why does she not talk in this movie? Why is there no lip reading? Deaf culture issues (oralism v manualism) go unexplored. Why was Ruby made fun of at school for talking like a deaf person when her parents don't talk? How did she learn to talk? Too much goes unexplored. Did Miles know about the bullying? Parents feel quirky for quirkiness sake - day sex? Silly. A lot of false conflicts. What's the point of the cliffs? Why didn't Ruby's friend (dating her brother) learn to sign? Problems would be solved. Despite all this, the last third of the movie is strong and I cried. The script just needed rewrites to fill in the holes.

            "content": "A gloriously heartwarming picture and intimate portrayal of a deaf family.\n\nDirector Si\u00e2n Heder's coming of age drama CODA (Child of Deaf Adults) (2021) is a truly moving picture with astoundingly creative filmmaking. Heder's direction feels completely in control and natural. Her ability to balance the coming of age comedy of high school friendship, relationships, choir practice, college applications with musical singing auditions and family drama centered around fishing work and deaf accessibility is incredible. CODA easily earned their nomination for a Best Picture Oscar at The Academy Awards. I hope CODA wins!\n\nSi\u00e2n Heder's direction is very poignant as she puts you into the shoes of a poor family, further struggling in this Massachusetts fishing community because three of the four of them are deaf. You listen to beautiful music for the singing passages, but it is the unheard pleas and troubles of people who cannot hear that reverberates loudest about CODA. She lets you feel like you're in this quaint and close-knit family dynamic with her intimate dramatic scenes with realistic and grounded conflicts. Heder's heartfelt depiction of how deaf people must live in America also inspires courage with Emilia Jones' fantastic singing abilities and musical journey. I'm so happy to see more lady directors like the bright shining star Si\u00e2n Heder rise to the forefront of cinema.\n\nWriter Si\u00e2n Heder's sincere care for the deaf community is self-evident as she empathetically relates viewers to their daily struggles as real people with their own perspectives. Seeing the numerous ways that deaf humans have to communicate with other deaf people and hearing individuals is fascinating and touching. Heder's dialogue feels so interesting as CODA is hilarious with outrageous jokes and devastatingly real with her tumultuous family drama. This story is certainly similar to other coming of age comedies and dramas, but it is entirely unique in its execution. I loved how specific and playful her writing feels. Honestly, Heder should have been nominated for her fearsome direction and inventive script.\n\nEnglish actress, singer, songwriter Emilia Jones is a charming delight as Ruby Rossi in CODA! I found Emilia Jones absolutely gorgeous with a magnetic personality. Her effervescent natural beauty and captivating facial expressions make her dreamy. She has very expressive eyes to act out Ruby's shy natural and hurt feelings. Jones has a subtle grace to her delivery. I am totally blown away by Emilia Jones. Her impressively fast sign language skills are as mind boggling as her powerful singing prowess. I don't even understand how Emilia Jones could be so talented to act with a believable American accent instead of her natural, cute, posh English accent. She simultaneously was acting, signing, and singing in the finale audition! Her shy and dreamy lead actress performance in CODA will remain one of the coming of age genre's finest claims to fame. How Emilia Jones for CODA or Rachel Zegler for West Side Story were not nominated for Best Actress Oscars over Jessica Chastain or Nicole Kidman will forever be lost on me. I cannot wait to see Emilia Jones again.\n\nTrailblazing, American, deaf actress Marlee Matlin is excellent as Ruby's tough and unsympathetic mother Jackie Rossi. She really plays it mean and selfish, before Jackie opens up to her daughter. Matlin is a class act and a brilliant actress and CODA proves her versatility. I do not understand how Marlee Matlin is getting passed up for Best Supporting Actress everywhere as she's as gripping as Troy Kotsur.\n\nEveryone will love groundbreaking, American, deaf actor Troy Kotsur as Ruby's amiable and frustrated fisherman father Frank Rossi. His expressive sign language and hilarious delivery make him so charming and fun. The scene where he touches Ruby's throat to hear how wonderful her singing is really moved me. No wonder he is sweeping Best Supporting Actor all awards season!\n\nDaniel Durant is incredibly nuanced as Ruby's deaf fisherman brother Leo Rossi. I completely understood how his character felt when the other fisherman mocked him for being deaf or when he perceptively understood how Ruby felt about singing. He's really quite remarkable in his own right. The only reason Daniel Durant is not getting more recognition is because he's surrounded by genius actors delivering equally impressive performances. Canadian actress Amy Forsyth has real chemistry with Durant. She is very pretty and funny as Ruby's outgoing friend Gertie.\n\nMexican actor Eugenio Derbez is a riot as Ruby's encouraging choir teacher Bernardo Villalobos. His energetic charisma, funny delivery, deft piano playing, and skillful singing are all mesmerizing. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is quite nice and likable as Miles. His singing is pleasant as is his guitar playing, but it is his personable manner that really redeems Miles after his initial standoffish behavior and cruel mistake that hurts poor Ruby's feelings.\n\nGeraud Brisson's swift editing makes CODA's 112 minutes swim by briskly for a pleasant 112 minutes. It feels fast paced with sweet montages of fishing, singing, or hanging out that are quite effective. I love the hard cuts between Ruby having to go from fishing all day to attending school and choir practice that really let you feel how busy and overworked she is constantly. Paula Huidobro's cinematography is gorgeous with all these stunning wide shots of the ocean or the Rossi's family fishing vessel. The medium shots during the conversations and the close-ups of faces are very tender. CODA has a very personal and intimate feel. I loved all the natural scenery from the sea to the quarry and trees.\n\nDiane Lederman's production design is great as you see how poor the Rossi family is supposed to be with their messy house that is essentially a large wooden shack. Paul Richards' art direction focuses on light pouring in naturally through windows and across the boat. I love how bright and vibrant CODA looks. For all the mean viewers and critics bashing CODA, I was actually taken aback by how sleek and creative the craftsmanship is in all aspects of CODA. Set decorators Chris Conroy, Vanessa Knoll, Deborah Kehs, Thyra Heder, Joshua Manning, Mazie Biswell, Christina Bauer, Sara Itkis, Steven Coutts, Christopher Doig, James Giovannucci, Jamie Joseph, Chris Sawtelle, Layla Calo-Fee, Setha Phongsavan, Collin Williams, and Jonathan Langeveld provide quaint set dressing and furnishings for this fishing family. From the house with scattershot posters and plates to the realistic fishing equipment.\n\nComposer Marius de Vries' lovely score for CODA is mesmerizing with uplifting melodies and powerful songwriting. The music chimes in with a pleasant warmth and softness I liked. Sound designers Martin Pinsonnault, St\u00e9phane Bergeron, Paul Col, Alexandra Fehrman, and David Tremblay do more than just create all the ambient noises around CODA's town. Their cutting out sound or fading out noises to simulate what it is like to be deaf is creative genius. Meanwhile, they beautifully and clearly mix Emilia Jones' transcendent vocals. The singing passages sound pristine and Emilia's soft voice sounds all the more divine thanks to their authentic acoustic mixing. CODA has a crisp and up front vocal mix.\n\nCostume designers Brenda Abbandandolo and Courtney Stephens create layered fisherman garments and gear alongside super cute sweaters and plaid shirts for Emilia Jones attending school. Everything she wears feels practical, modern, and something her small town girl Ruby would actually adorn. Juliet Loveland and Krystle Poulin's make-up lets Emilia glow with a natural radiance.\n\nIn conclusion, CODA remains one of 2021's finest crafted films and most earnestly entertaining movies.",

Hollywood is falling for its preaching, its predictability, its sentimental cliches. If this is what the cinema has to offer, it would be best to simply cancel the Oscars. TV is so much better.

I have followed everything Marlee Matlin has ever been in and she is one of my favorite actresses. She was amazing yet again in this film. The actors that played the father and son were new to me but equally amazing and the lead, CODA herself did a wonderful job as a hearing teen that grew up in this Culturally DEAF family, ASL her first language and the struggles and joys and extra responsibility ability of interpreting for your family all your life is a story I have witnessed in many CODA's. Many go on to be certified interpreters whom I have worked with. She also did a wonderful job singing, another passion of mine. Beautiful story and wonderfully directed, set, and acted by all!

Her problem: she sings like a nightingale--though she's rather shy about letting anyone know--and her high school choirmaster wants to take her under his wing and coach her. Will she allow him to? SHOULD she allow him to? \"CODA\"--or Children of Deaf Adults--is about how she learns to conquer her fears, wow audiences, let her pop flag fly--and even perform for her parents. There are lots of teenagers here, but not the brash, uber-confident ones that populate so many teen movies; these kids, led by Emilia Jones as Ruby and Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as her good-natured boyfriend Miles, are sweetly sincere and socially awkward and always a joy to watch. Ruby's scenes with Mr. Villalobos, played by Eugenio Derbez as the kind of dedicated teacher we all wish we'd had (at times the film resembles a seminar on how to properly deliver a tune), are never less than wonderful, and the subplot involving her parents' determined efforts to expand the family business (the ostracization of the Rossi clan offers a nice counterpoint to the main storyline) carries some emotional weight of its own. How will the Rossi family fare? Will Ruby realize her dream? With Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur as Mom and Dad, and Daniel Durant as brother Leo. It's already received a number of accolades, and deservedly so. Like a thirty-pound tuna wrestled out of the sea, this one's a keeper.  Buy a ticket, and bring the Kleenex.",

It certainly has the cliche elements of a story that involves someone finding their identity, but the way the film truly focuses on heartfelt themes like family, love and friendship is the key to the success this film has garnered since it's August release last year.\n\nI am writing this at the time of its recent awards success (BAFTA and SAG awards) and the supporting actor winner for Troy Kotsur really was deserved for the uniqueness of his performance. He evokes humour, love and passion throughout the film and all that is made even more incredible due to him being deaf. Emilia Jones as the central character Ruby was equally as good, she will be a fine actress no doubt and her music tutor Mr Villalobos played brilliantly by Eugenio Derbez was a hilarious gem consistently throughout. \n\nLikewise, the score by Marius De Vries compliments the film perfectly. The various tracks produce a variety of feelings that elevate your emotions towards the characters. It's exactly what a soundtrack should do and it played a major part in me loving this film as much as a I did.\n\nAs most films though, it's not perfect. Perhaps it is predictable come the end, but it's narrative is simple and for me it works well. It was slamming any message down your throats, it's a film you can just observe and learn from, as films should make you feel. \n\nA really enjoyable film with many memorable moments, I'm so glad to see it doing well in awards season and while it might be a long shot for Best Picture, you just never know.",

This movie has multiple scenes that are so compelling and so touching that it can help me forget some of the clich\u00e9 and possibly cheesy scenes in the first act of the film.

I was so impressed with her acting and with her absolutely breathtaking voice, I couldn't get enough!\n\nMy only gripe with the film is that, as mentioned, it did feel cheesy at times and their were storylines/scenes that felt a little too familiar. I felt the first act had a lot of scenes that I've seen before. The movie is a little predictable, but it's crowd pleasing and it is what you would want from this type of movie.

I also love the comedy in this movie.\n\nCODA is about an 18-year-old named Ruby who is the only one in her family of four without a hearing impairment. Her father is a fisherman, and she needs to help her dad with fishing since he can't hear. For example, if he violates a fishing code, the Coast Guard calls him, but he cannot respond because he can't hear the call.  That's when Ruby comes in handy. Ruby's passion is singing. Her dream is to go to the Berklee College of Music. She finds out about a chorus group and joins it, which leads to some conflicts\u2014primarily that her family relies on her, but she also wants to live her life and go to college.\n\nCODA, which stands for \"child of deaf adults\", is an outstanding film (with many awards and nominations) that is a remake of the 2014 French film, La Famille B\u00e9lier. Sian Heder wrote and directed this beautiful adapted screenplay. Not only is this film heartwarming and comical at the same time, but it also lets the audience experience what it is to be deaf to the point of feeling vulnerable by not experiencing the joy of a live concert. My favorite part is when Ruby performs a song on stage with her family watching in the crowd. This is the most interesting and heartwarming scene because when they cut out the audio you get to see the dad's point of view. You really feel what he experiences as a deaf person.\n\nThere are many morals to this film, but the main one is that no matter what you suffer from or who you are\u2014or even how you look\u2014we are all humans. We should all be treated equally, and we are each unique in our own way. CODA does have some sexual scenes and foul language.\n\nI give CODA 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. CODA is available now on Apple TV. By Ethan P., KIDS FIRST!",

How is it possible that the pianist at a prestigious music school does not know a standard like Both Sides Now? Would the judges really fall for the gimmick the voice coach used to get her to start over again? The family has fished for decades, long before their hearing daughter was able to help them.

The arguments in the film largely take place in near-silence, which is not only realistic, but demonstrates just how good the acting is, as the performers have to express themselves without so much as raising their voices. The story is fairly predictable, with the protagonist bouncing between what she wants to do and what is expected of her, but the writing, acting and direction is enough to make it feel fresh, and for the themes to feel resonant. It sheds light not just on the deaf community, but also the plight of hard-working fishermen and women who break their backs day in and out and yet still get dumped on from those \u2018above them.' Their fighting back against their superiors is almost a metaphor for their fighting for societal acceptance, and the film is smart enough not only to show how people have varying reactions to deaf individuals, but that those same individuals are not, by any means, perfect. A lesser filmmaker would have portrayed the deaf family as being innocent angels fighting against an evil world, but we're shown their very humans flaws. Hypocrisy, dishonesty, selfishness etc. These are things that everybody can understand, and presenting the family in a more realistic light makes them more believable. It can be funny and emotional in the same scene, and it hopeful without having to resort to mawkishness. It's a great to see a film about a minority that doesn't condescend or patronise, and isn't afraid to highlight faults wherever they lie. CODA is, simply, a great movie, and I hope it that as many people see it as possible. It honestly, truly deserves it.",

I could easily see this winning best picture and I can't help but want to just rave about this film. I loved getting to peek inside the lives and challenges of a marginalized and often forgotten group. It's shows that the difficulties brought in by deafness are not only experienced by the deaf people themselves but also their family members, especially their children who can hear. It's a brilliant and heartfelt exploration of this as we follow Ruby, a young girl whose deaf family relies on her to help with their fishing business while she looks to pursue her love of music, something they can't truly get a sense of. I thought it was just excellent and I LOVED it. Sure, it's somewhat formulaic for the coming of age genre, but it's a truly radiant film, it's a deeply satisfying heart-warmer that embraces the pleasure and pureness of the formula, reminding one of the comforting and cathartic feelings of a feel good story that's well told. And that's exactly what this is. Emilia Jones is stunningly good in this movie and delivers what I think was one of the best performances this year. Not to mention her singing voice is gorgeous and she learned to both sing and sign for this role! The movie is just fantastic and it works so well as a comedy-drama, it's just exactly why it needs to be. Director Si\u00e2n Heder did a perfect job, every aspect of this film excelled. It's simplistic, beautiful and delightful. I truly loved it. It's a must see masterpiece. \nI could very much see this taking Best Picture at the Oscars.",

The contrast of her love for music and her family who cannot hear is beautifully told as they don't understand why she has such a love for it. While it is heavily involved in her life, the music side of the story never takes the spotlight away from the sweet family dynamic, both storylines complimenting each other really well.\n\nNot only is CODA (2021) a sweet story about music and this family dynamic, but also serves as a good coming of age story for Ruby Rossi as she grows throughout.

Plenty of traditional elements - the coming-of-age storyline, the liberation through expression, the testy but loving family dynamic - are each done well but aren't necessarily original by themselves, nor is the film's main differentiator (the deafness of several characters) particularly deeply integrated. That said, the film is perfectly serviceable, hitting many of the right narrative notes with characters that fill comfortable family roles without feeling boring, taking on a full range of expressiveness rather than overemphasizing the deafness or letting it define their characters (Troy Kotsur as Frank is a particularly entertaining and relatable dad). Nice, sweet, not a particular classic. (3/5)",

            "content": "Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones) falls under the category of CODA, a Child Of a Deaf Adult. Her mother (Marlee Matlin) and father (Tony Kotsur) and her older brother (Daniel Durant) are all deaf, and she is the only member of her household with the ability to hear. She's balancing working for her family on their fishing trawler, maintaining good grades in school, and possibly pursuing scholarships to enroll at a music and fine arts college for singing. Ruby's music teacher agrees to train her because he believes in her potential, but Ruby has to worry that her dream is something that cannot be shared with the people she loves most, and how would they all get on without her?\n\nThe framework of CODA is familiar to anyone who has watched a coming-of-age story or family drama, but it's the conviction and strength of character and sheer force of empathy that makes this movie a standout film for 2021. It's based upon a 2014 French film, The Family Beller, and follows many of the same beats from other sentimental family dramas about sticking out in your family and society, chasing your dream, often in conflict with your family's expectations, gaining that sense of inner strength and resolve, and mending differences in perspective with hard-fought and well-earned wisdom. It's familiar, but that doesn't mean under the right set of hands that it cannot still be resonant and emotionally gratifying. I do not hold the familiar formula against CODA, even as the family's goal and her personal goal come into direct conflict in sometimes forced manners. That's because the movie does an excellent job of establishing these people as characters, establishing the family dynamic as fraught but loving, and establishing a conflict that is direct and clear as far a major point of separation.\n\nRuby isn't just the only member of her family who can hear, she's also their vital lifeline to the outside world. She's looked upon as the family interpreter, a position they cannot afford to pay for someone else's services so the duties and responsibilities fall upon her. That's so much pressure to bear for one teenage girl, knowing that she's the link between her family's poverty-treading existence and possibly breaking free into a larger hearing community. She feels ostracized and awkward within her own family and outside of her own family. To the rest of the school, she's that \"deaf family girl,\" and it's remarked that when she began high school she had an accent reminiscent of what deaf people can sound like, a point that her peers cruelly imitate. She worries she will forever be defined by her family's disability even if she doesn't share it. However, within her family, she feels ostracized because she's different. She wonders if her mother wishes that she too were deaf, and during a heartfelt late-night talk, mom actually admits that upon her daughter's birth she did feel disappointment when Ruby had hearing. While she knows sign language and has grown up with these loving figures, she'll still always be the one who's different, the one who hears the insults her family cannot.\n\nThe film does a remarkable effort about contextualizing Ruby's fears and frustrations of being held captive in two different worlds, neither feeling fully accepted or whole, and that's why her embarking on a personal dream that her family can never fully appreciate feels so significant. Part of Ruby might feel that singing is selfish, especially if it means limiting her family's upward mobility by eliminating their unpaid interpreter, but it's the thing that makes her most happy, a special gift that her family will be excluded from. There's a wonderful moment toward the end of the movie where Ruby's father asks her to sing to him, and he puts his hands along her shoulders and neck to feel the vibrations, and his awed and tear-stricken face is so moving, as he so desperately wants to indulge too in the beauty of his daughter's voice. While occasionally the film goes overboard pounding these two conflicting paths into forced collision (family vs. self), the movie is personal with its big problems and personal with its big triumphs, making it transcend the trappings of formula.\n\nWriter/director Sian Heder got her start on Orange is the New Black, and that TV series' hallmark has been its enormous sense of empathy for its diverse characters. This is evident in Heder's screenplay and her observational, detail-rich simple storytelling that immerses you in this world, so even while you recognize more familiar made-for-TV plot turns, the genuine authenticity makes the movie feel like its own unique story. Heder's direction is delicate and places the attention squarely on her performers. There is one stylistic move late in the film when Ruby's family comes to her choir recital in support. They look around for cues when to applaud, and their minds wander as they sign about other menial topics like grocery lists, and you understand why once Heder drops you into their perspective. For a minute, the sound disappears, and you're left studying facial expressions for cues like them. While we can imagine being deaf, it's another matter to experience it and try and understand.\n\nThe acting is another laudable merit for CODA. I personally want three Oscar nominations for this clan, Jones (Locke & Key) for Best Actress, Matlin (Children of a Lesser God) for Best Supporting Actress, and Kotsur (Wild Prairie Rose) for Best Supporting Actor. Over the course of nine months, Jones learned American Sign Language and how to sing, which is surprising because I would have said she has a natural talent with singing. Her performance, as well as Matlin and Kotsur, feel so real, so nuanced, and so natural, like we've plucked these people from real life and given them this platform. It's the best credit you can give an actor, when they seemingly disappear into the character, and the character feels like a fully breathing, flesh-and-blood person. Even the small supporting roles are well cast, well acted, and contribute to the overall authenticity of the movie. Unlike the 2014 French original movie, all of the deaf members of the family are portrayed by actual deaf actors as well.\n\nCODA was a sensation at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival, with Apple Films buying the rights for $25 million dollars, and it's easy to see why because it's such a satisfying, enriching crowd-pleaser and legit tear-jerker. There were several points that had me tearing up, and then fully crying, because I was so emotionally engaged with the family, their struggles, and their triumphs and outpouring of love. You might be able to see where the movie is headed because its template is familiar and formulaic, but it's the execution, the attention to detail, and the level of observational attention that elevates CODA and makes it so winning and so heartwarming.\n\nNate's Grade: A",

However, after screening it, I can't help but say that this manipulative, cloying, clich\u00e9-ridden, saccharin-encrusted offering lives up to every one of those guilt-inducing traps. Writer-director Si\u00e2n Heder's second feature outing tells the story of a Gloucester, Massachusetts high school senior who's the only hearing member of a family of deaf individuals. She's torn between pursuing her passion for singing and staying with her parents and brother to help them sort out the family's troubled fishing business. At its heart, it's narrative terrain that's been covered a number of times before, albeit with different particulars. That in itself would be fine if it weren't for the trite way in which the material is presented here, a production laden with the aforementioned calculated, derivative qualities that make it ordinary instead of outstanding. The picture also suffers from a screenplay and direction riddled inconsistent character development, left-field plot twists, underdeveloped story threads and over-the-top quirks, making this an often-frustrating watch. Admittedly, the film has some genuinely heartwarming moments, such as a number of heart-to-heart conversations between the protagonist and her family members, as well as fine performances by Emilia Jones and Marlee Matlin, but those attributes are hardly enough to give this one a ringing endorsement. This might not be an awful film, but its premise certainly lends itself to a more engaging treatment than is present here.",

It gives off a teen movie vibe. Yes, the film categorizes in the coming-of-age genre. However, the film loads itself with tropes that you can find in a Disney Channel flick. This issue makes CODA feel slightly predictable. The cast makes up for this slight letdown as each actor is so good. Emilia Jones does an extraordinary job as Ruby and packs an emotional performance that brings CODA to new heights. It is incredible to see her handle all these complex situations while using ASL. Troy Kotsur is phenomenal as the father to Ruby. Even though Kotsur has a slightly weak character, he pulls through with some of the best moments in the film. Daniel Durant is solid as Leo, Ruby's brother. While he did not have enough power to make his character's actions feel warranted, his emotion is strong enough for it not to fall through. Marlee Matlin is who I connected least to, but she had a firm performance overall. Lastly, Eugenio Derbez is hilarious but emotionally powerful as Mr. V, Ruby's choir teacher. The characters in CODA have some strong actors attached to them. Yet, the characteristics the screenplay gives them are slightly weak. It is hard to believe that this family would treat Ruby this way. When Ruby expresses a slight interest in singing, her mom grins and replies with \"If I were blind, would you want to paint?\" Come on. That is a little much. Plus, the way Mr. V treated Ruby was sort of out of line. These instances fall into the cliche coming-of-age trope, and I wish the script felt slightly more unique. Writer and director Sian Heder had a unique concept, and some minor tweaking would have set this film apart from other coming-of-age dramas. Even though CODA has its hiccups, the film is such an enjoyable watch. Yes, the platitude characters and plot points can be a tad distracting. However, Troy Kotsur and Emilia Jones make this film feel larger than life. CODA emphasizes the struggles of being deaf while still being potent and fun. The mixture of these elements produces a film that is worth watching. Read more reviews like at postcreditreviews.com",

This film is the refined representation about belong to one community just, regardless of the problems that arise in everyday life, we all deserve our place here.\nThe script is its strongest aspect, it shows very genuine moments that will remain reflected in your mind for a long time and knows how to play with our feelings to make us realize that the sign language its maybe the second idiom most important below your mother language. Nevertheless, it has some moments that doesn't have any development, the scenes has impact, but they are in someway unimportant. But that is not an impediment to get an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.\nThe ensemble is one of the best of the 2021, everyone give the best of themselves, but Emilia Jones is excellent in her performance, I would like to see her nominated in this awards season.",

            "content": "The Sundance Film Festival has always been known for giving a great platform to unassuming films by little-known filmmakers. Many of the festival's winners have gone on to win prestigious awards. CODA could be the next candidate in which this scenario occurs. Not only is it one of the biggest crowd-pleasers of the year, but the coming-of-age story gives the sneezy cast of deaf-mute performers a chance to shine.\n\nIt is important to mention that CODA is based on the French comedy Do You Understand the B\u00e9liers. Whereas in the original work, however, only hearing actors embody the almost exclusively deaf-mute family members, here it is people with the actual affliction. At the latest since Sound of Metal showed this fascinating group in such a grandiose way, deaf-muteness in films has been on everyone's lips. Director Sian Heder wraps this concept in a film reminiscent of coming-of-age stories like Lady Bird and Juno. The youngest member of the family, Ruby, is the only hearing one in her family and helps her loved ones make ends meet as a translator in a less tolerant society. The family owns a fishing business, into which several obstacles get in the way as the plot unfolds. But that is not the main story. Rather, the film is told through Ruby's eyes and accompanies her as she is torn between staying true to her family or pursuing her dream as a singer. 19-year-old Emilia Jones plays this character as authentically and adolescently as possible, and you buy into her almost impossible situation, but one that seems so remote from our point of view. The best moments in CODA occur when she shares emotional dialogue with her parents and brother. Although they only gesture with sign language, you follow the conversation as if it were the spoken word we are used to. This is thanks to the great performances of Oscar winner Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur and Laniel Durant. They seem very bizarre and different at first, but it becomes increasingly clear that they too have normal concerns and needs apart from their deafness. Eugenio Derbez, as Ruby's mentor and singing teacher, is also a constant in the protagonist's life that we wish we had.\n\nOut the back, CODA lives up to all the hype as a crowd pleaser. Some scenes press hard on the tear gland and are carried by great sung musical accompaniment. Before that, however, the film takes almost half the time to finally get going. This is detrimental to the film because the plot lost me a little after the long delay. One should not expect surprises anyway. The film follows a classic pattern, but the predictability does it little harm. Rather, the fact that the family conflict built up in the first half never fully unfolds. Only between brother and sister is there a reckoning, but this is not really pursued. In retrospect, however, this is forgotten, as Heder knows how to rely on elements towards the end that simply appeal to filmgoers. I fell for that too and that is the reason why I enjoyed CODA so much in the end. Viewed as a whole, however, the film has obvious weaknesses, which is why I cannot rank it among the top tier coming-of-age stories.",

You can tell a lot of care went into making this film and it really comes off as feeling super authentic. I realized as I was watching it how much I began to care about the characters and I was really hoping everything would go well for them all. I felt that I had been apart of the story with how relatable it is and how well it is acted out and directed. I did feel that the middle section lost a little bit of traction with the story maybe staying a little to long in some scenes. The last section of this film however is very powerful and moving. You see this family grow through trials and the final payoff of the film really rewards viewers for becoming engaged in  the film. The film left me feeling joyful and excited to take on my own personal  next steps in this crazy thing we call life. In my opinion this is a must watch and a film that should not be overlooked.",

            "content": "High school crossroads.  So this is about a teenage girl (Emilia Jones).  Her entire family is deaf, and she is the only one who can hear.  She has a decision looming in her near future: does she pursue her musical abilities in post-secondary education, or does she abandon that by the wayside to help support the family fishing business?  Now this one caught my eye on Apple TV+ because the trailers looked intriguing.  Deaf people get so little representation in television and film, so I added this to my watchlist to check out at my earliest opportunity.  I'm glad that I did because this is one of the stronger films of the year.  The only thing I had heard about this beforehand was how it has scenes that will rip your heart out.  While that is mostly what the third act consists of, all of that would have been for naught if they didn't lay the groundwork in advance.  They take the time to make you like and connect with this family, and you can relate because this girl has normal teenage problems on top of her family's condition.  She's got a bit of stage freight, she gets lightly bullied, she has trouble talking to the boy she's crushing on, and she gets embarrassed by her parents.  All members of this family turn in impressive performances through ASL, but I think that Emilia Jones shines brightest.  She's a talented little actress who is cast age-appropriately as a high schooler and not only that, she has some pipes on her as well.  It reminded me in a way of Florence Foster Jenkins.  Not that she sings poorly, mind you, but she has to vary her talent as she learns the craft.  That is a difficult feat to pull off when you clearly already know your vocal range and abilities.  The story to this isn't anything new.  This is a coming-of-age tale at its core, and it has all of the moments that you would expect to see in that kind of story.  CODA gets by on the strengths of its performances, and I would be surprised to see a dry eye in the room if I watched this in a group setting.  My only real complaint is that the choir teacher played by Eugenio Derbez.  He felt a bit cartoony at times, and he went over the top in the same way that Taika Waititi has in the past to varying degrees of success.  I don't think it quite fit the tone at times, but it wasn't enough to spoil it for me.  This is a tear-jerker, and I feel that it successfully earned all of the waterworks that it got out of me.",

The characters in this movie are realistic, likeable, and the acting is just wonderful. While the story focuses on a unique subject matter which some people may find uncomfortable, the tone of the movie never portrays it that way and even adds humour that feels normal and not forced to lighten the mood. It doesn't portray its characters or world in an idealistic view either; everything feels authentic. The joy you feel in this movie is fully earned. Also, Emilia Jones is fantastic, showing off her singing talents and portraying deep emotions. This film draws you in on a fishing line from the start, respects your time, and rewards your attentiveness. This window into the world of the deaf offers a realistic representation of the subject and is elevated even more by hearty performances from all involved.",

CODA stands for Child of Deaf Adults and is the story of a small family in a fishing village in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Mother and father and son are deaf whilst Ruby, the daughter, is able to hear. They run a fishing business and Ruby helps them in that and also communicating with the outside world. She is also a very talented singer and when pushed by her high school music teacher she realises her gifts are great and perhaps another life lies beyond the small village she lives in. It comes to a head when she has the chance to audition at the Berklee School of Music in Boston. She is torn between staying to help her family and following her dreams. In of itself it's not a fresh story, but it is made fresh here by centering deaf people at the heart of the story. The film adeptly shows the family has the same hopes and dreams of any family. They are a close knit family and just wish the world would not treat them specially but just afford them the same opportunities as any other family. Young English actress Emilia Jones is wonderful as Ruby, showing not just a great voice but bringing a great deal of winning charm to the role. And once again its great to see Marlee Matlin shine again in such a prominent role as her mother. This film was a huge hit at Sundance this year and Apple paid a record $25m to secure the rights. You can see why as the film reeks of authenticity and emotional scope. It does well to be sentimental but not tip into cliche, a film that will actually make you laugh and cry.

With her second feature, writer/director Sian Heder gives a voice to voiceless communities by creating compassionate portrait of a tighknit deaf family through disabled casting. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to humanize the hardships experienced by hearing children of deaf families, but she pulls it off effectively. Using spellbinding cinematography, Heder draws viewers into struggles faced by a hearing teen obligated to provide for her deaf family. Heder's decision to shoot the movie in a smalltown setting is risky, but it works immensely. It lends a sense of realism and authenticity to the movie missing from the original French film, making it feel like a lived-in place. Heder showcases immense control over sound design, editing techniques and music, using these elements to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. Heder's screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses subtle sign-language to establish the compassionate bond between a close-knit deaf family. It's hard to not praise phenomenal performances from cast. Emilia Jones delivers a star-making performance as Ruby Rossi. With mesmerizing expressions, she conveys angst, compassion and lifelong resentments of a hearing  teenager that strives to make ends meet for her financially needy deaf family. The supporting cast is sensational and also worthy of recognition. Heder's decision to cast hard-of-hearing actors pays off tremendously. Troy Kotsur, in particular, leaves a lasting impression as Ruby's affectionate patriarch through meaningful gestures.   Although \"CODA\"  is undeniably an unforgettable family drama, ultimately it isn't a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it's slightly undermined by an unnecessary teen romance subplot that distracts from the deaf family's conflict. Nevertheless, fans of coming-of-age dramas will definitely enjoy \"CODA\" and so will movie-goers seeking meaningful entertainment. If Cinema has power to give voice to voiceless communities, it's time Hollywood honored deaf communities by giving them a loud rather than quiet place in an industry where they can peacefully chase dreams even when luck may not always be in their destinies.",

Coda is both a more accurate and explicit depiction of the deaf community. It doesn't shy away away from presenting us the community in its entirety while also capturing our sympathy and empathy. It touches on family, love, and how we are as humans and how our experiences influence our decisions, whether right to wrong.

            "content": "CODA stands for Child Of Deaf Adults.  The movie debuted in Park City at the Sundance Festival back in January.  It won numerous awards and Apple purchased the distribution rights for 25 million dollars.  It was released a few weeks ago on Apple TV+ and disturbed to a limited number of theaters.  It is interesting that given the fact that Apple paid so much for the distribution that they are not actively promoting the film.  I've never seen any commercials for it and they are not really pushing it on Apple TV+.  The only reason I watched it was because I noticed it got a 96 rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nLet's go through some of the bad and then get to the good.  CODA is, for all intent purposes, a standard formulized \"Feel Good\" movie.  There are very few surprises here.  The main character is Ruby in a standard \"Kid with talent but lives a hard life\" role.  Enough to make you groan.  Also it has received a few mixed reviews from the deaf community for its portrayal of the family.  I can certainly understand that even though I won't even begin to say I can relate.\n\nNone the less\u2026..The movie is not perfect however it gets very close.  Ruby is played by Amelia Jones, who gives the performance of a lifetime.  Her family is played by all deaf actors and, as an ensemble, their work is flawless.  I see so many movies where, in the end, I did not give a shit about any of the characters.  This movie lures you in and you find yourself caring for, rooting for the family.  And yes it is a tear-jerker.  I want to see this in a packed theater just to watch the crowd.  This is one of those rare movies that appeals to all.  It's love and magic.  \n\nCODA is the best I have seen this year.  My belief is that it's a lock for a Best Picture nomination, Amelia Jones is in for Best Actress.  I could also see Eugenio Derbez getting a Best Supporting Actor nod as the music teacher. It's early still but \"Classic\" may be how this movie is described in years to come.\n\n**********\n\nI wrote the above review last summer.  And it remained the best movie I saw last year.  I was wrong about Jones and Derbez but I felt they were deserving......",

We are not costumes to put on, not any longer,\" Matlin says. \"I've seen so many times in this industry where hearing actors take on the role of deaf characters. We've had enough of that. It's time for myself and other deaf actors to be able to speak up and say, enough is enough. We are here. Our talents are valid.\" \nThe movie is all the more poignant and funny because of that.

Solidly and beautifully directed, with a tastefully appropriate, though a little on-the-nose, soundtrack; the stand out here is the winsome performance by British newcomer Emilia Jones who, as Ruby, the only hearing member in a deaf family whose ironically constructed passion is singing, convincingly plays American and proves a deft hand in ASL. Learning from the mistake made by the French original, the deaf family members here are played by deaf actors and Troy Kotsur, Daniel Durant and Oscar winner Marlee Matlin's likeable portrayal of the close-knit and often excessively honest (and horny) Rossi family is the only unconventional element in a fairly conventional film. Essentially, there are three intertwined stories that will be neatly and predictably resolved by the end of the film, involving Ruby's crush on Miles (an unrecognisable Ferdia Walsh-Peelo from Sing Street); the family's struggling fishing business that sees the previously reclusive family opening up to others; and that difficult choice between family obligations and going to music college, under the tutelage of her Mexican music teacher, a funny and slightly flamboyant turn from Eugenio Derbez. Normally, the deaf element would constitute a fresh distinctive angle but coming so soon after the amazing Sound of Metal, even that's now been done and done better, though comparisons between the two may not be entirely fair. However, judged as the crowd-pleaser that it clearly aims to be, its wholesomeness and positivity is infectious and undeniable, even if the rom-com tropes and contrived conflicts that get resolved far too easily make this film feel too safe and sometimes, corny even.",

First of all, the acting was superb, the soundtrack flawless and the story that some might see as formulaic, was a real ear-opener to me (pun intended). The movie managed to make me clap, dance and laugh at jokes that were delivered in sign language, all the while telling a story of exclusion/inclusion that felt like it really needed to be told especially at this point in time. Without giving the story away, just enjoy this movie in all of it's sound and soundless moments. Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur are fantastic but the rest of the cast is great as well and the director, Sian Heder has woven a feel-good tapestry that is fresh as the ocean breeze without a hint of Gloucester fish! I just want to recommend that everyone who can see this movie should see this movie--it is great for date night, family movie night and especially for those who need a lift during these turbulent and oh-so-divisive times!",

The big studios, of course, can't be bothered these days with much of anything that isn't a sequel, a reboot, and/or based on a comic book. So \"CODA\" is a modest-budget independent film, though one lucky enough to attract the attention of Apple TV+ at the Sundance Film Festival. This remake of a 2014 French film is set in Gloucester, Massachusetts, a fishing town north of Boston. It stars Emilia Jones, a wonderful actress I had never seen before, as Ruby, a teenager who dreams of singing but is held back by the fact that her mother, father, and brother, who are all deaf, are dependent upon her to keep the family fishing business afloat. Marlee Matlin, 35 years past her Oscar-winning performance in \"Children of a Lesser God,\" plays Ruby's mother with warmth and humor and may find herself back in the gold derby again in the supporting contest. And she might be joined at the Oscar party by the well known (at least in Mexico and among Spanish-speaking audiences in the U.S.) Eugenio Derbez, who brings some nice layers to his role as the tough but inspirational music teacher who encourages Ruby to pursue her dreams. The entire film gives off a lovely glow that only the most churlish out there will resist. No grandstanding political statements being crammed down the audience's collective throats,; just good storytelling. Bravo!",

Such a beautiful and talented redhead. Can you imagine how hard is to find an excellent actress that is also an amazing singer? Seriously, I am super impressed with the whole cast. If this is television, then Heder raised the bar very high. Not only was the direction fantastic, but so was the screenplay. It was witty, funny and intelligent. This should have been a theatrical film. Honestly, I'll keep it short because if I could, I could name about a dozen scenes in this film that I loved.

There were many funny and clever jokes mostly from the main character's deaf parents that showed the tight relationship in the family. I was consistently entertained with what our main character had to go through because she was the only hearing person in her family.\n\nThis led to the main conflict for our main character. The struggle between family responsibilities and one's hope and dream was a familiar theme that is explored many times before. However, the story created a new and unique situation that had me sympathized with not our main character, but also her family members. The family dynamics worked so well that the situation even more conflicting.\n\nStill, the movie had many sweet moments. The audition scene near the end was beautiful and got me emotional there. Also, Emilia Jones, who played the main girl Ruby, had a beautiful voice, and I loved every scene where she sang. \n\nAs for problems, the progression was definitely a bit formulaic, but it didn't bother me much at all.\n\nOverall, a sweet, beautiful, and unique slice of life/coming of age story. 9/10",
