It's an ode to survivors and sends a powerful message about what life is worth and how we should cherish it.\nI can only think that those who don't see the artistry in this film must not have ever known such suffering. \nTo me, this is a truly beautiful film that captures the essence of surviving and coping with life's inescapable injustices and contradiction. \nBravo üëè",

This is the real new cinema that takes chances with unknown faces and risk taking directing which combined make for something special here. Gully is rough to watch at times, but pulls no punches.",

On the contrary they have shown that they are very good at coaxing good performances from their cast and creating some dire situations.  The problem here is they fail to come up with a reason to tell such an unpleasant story that fails to make us care about a single character.  It is more frustrating because of it.  The outcome should ultimately be worth the struggle.",

It also lacks the grit of its contemporaries. P.s. Terrence Howard's role as a wise vagrant served little to no purpose than to wind me up with his nonsensical lines delivered under the guise of wisdom.",

Lots to think about and beautiful to look at. Definitely worthy of a higher rating.",
