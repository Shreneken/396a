If he's learned anything, it's that choice, while an illusion, is still the only way out of -- or into -- the Matrix. Neo already knows what he has to do, but what he doesn't yet know is that the Matrix is stronger, more secure and far more dangerous than ever before.",

Barney Stinson as a main evil character oof.. oh well with a different plot it might've been a good choice. Wich is the next point: The additional story is none existent. It had so much potential. If there was no other matrix movie before I'd give this one 3 or 2 mediocre stars. Considering the predecessors this one doesn't deserve a better rating.

            "content": "A pesar de que todo acabo en la tercera película, Matrix regreso con esta película que si bien haya gustado o no al público, da a entender que cada vez que un conflicto termina, siempre empieza uno nuevo. Se trata de una película muy diferente donde ya han pasado muchos años y todo ha cambiado. En la vida las cosas siempre cambian y las películas también. Uno de los puntos débiles de esta película es tener solo a Lana Wachowski a cargo, ya que Matrix ha sido creada por 2 mentes y parece que fue un reto dejar esta película a cargo de solo una de las mentes responsables. La película juega con el espectador al inicio, llegando al punto de casi romper la cuarta pared llena de metáforas sobre la sobreexplotación de una saga conocida e indicios de lo que Lana paso durante la creación de esta película solo para complacer a la Waner Bros. Nos presenta lo que ha sucedido después del final de la trilogía y una nueva Matrix que explora la condición humana a través de las emociones. La Matrix del inicio siempre iba con base en la exploración de la naturaleza humana de modo matemático, como si los humanos fueran solo algo cuyos movimientos y acciones se pueden calcular fríamente. Aquí tenemos una Matrix que explora la humanidad con base en las ilusiones que generan las emociones humanas. La filosofía de esta película es en como las emociones nos hacen creer en falsas esperanzas al punto de vivir en un sueño o una falsa ilusión creado por nuestro subconsciente. Paradógicamente, esto involucra el factor nostalgia que esta película generó en su estreno a todos los fanáticos de la saga. Eso hace que esta película sea bastante curiosa y la forma en que parece contar nuevamente la trama de la primera película, pero siendo un nuevo inicio para una nueva historia que comenzó con el final de la trilogía original. Keanu Reeves y Carrie-Anne Moss hacen un buen regreso a la saga manteniéndose fieles a sus personajes, aunque tenemos a un Neo que recién regresa y tiene que volver a recuperar sus fuerzas. El Morfeo que todo conocimos ahora es reemplazado por una versión digital del personaje que es una hibridación del Morfeo original con el Agente Smith, aunque no está a la altura de Laurence Fishburne. Finalmente, tenemos un Agente Smith reconstruido y rediseñado que ya no parece ser una amenaza, pero nos hace extrañar al Agente Smith de Hugo Weaving. Los efectos visuales son sin duda lo mejor, hay buenas escenas de acción, pero no tan excitantes como en las películas anteriores y la banda sonora es decente aún sin Don Davis. The Matrix Resurrections es una nueva ampliación al universo de Matrix, pero que en comparación con las demás películas acaba siendo una secuela hecha solo para explotar la fama de la saga. Mi clasificación final para esta película es un 8/10.",

            "content": "The Matrix Resurrections was an exciting watch and would have been an interesting standalone film. But it couldn't seem to decide if it wanted to pay homage to the originals, or leave them behind. It built on previous plot points but used a totally different tone and style. It used new actors, but played the part of old characters. The plot became rather confusing towards the end, and the exposition started to become visibly convenient for telling the story. Many of the decisions of the characters became confusing as their goals became muddled and the audience was left unsure of what to root for. What does Agent smith want? What is he doing there? Does Naomi want safety for IO, or to use it's resources to rescue neo and his girlfriend? What does neo actually want? The originals made what was desired clear: freedom.\n\nThe action was well choreographed but didn't seem to get the respect and space it deserved within the film. Fight scenes were crammed together with little foreplay, contrasting to the originals in which fight scenes were slowly built into (cast your mind back to the subway fight between neo and smith, which took a big chunk of the original), with the viewer getting no time to develop an appreciation of the gravity of such events. It's a problem many mainstream (and less critically acclaimed) films now have - they forget to breathe. There's no time for the viewer to get attached and instead we're thrust right into the action, which is ironic in this case, because the Matrix 4 seemed to be making a commentary about this very behavior in our day-to-day lives as we pull the shroud of endless Tiktok and Twitter feeds over our eyes and away from reality (or maybe that's just me.)\n\nThe film started off promising, this time once again leaving the viewer in a state of doubt as we witnessed Thomas Anderson wrestle with past memories of Neo, but the curtain was quickly lifted as the script became visible in the form of flat, unnecessary dialogue and marvel-style jokes. The original films set a serious tone, one that allowed a sense of derealization that was left with viewers, which was probably what cemented its place as a sci-fi classic. \n\nThe Matrix has a rich universe that is waiting to be explored, as glimpsed by some of the excellent work in the Animatrix. It is a shame this film did not better explore this, beyond some of the 'sentients' that were now living with humans. It would have been exciting to see some of the events prior The Matrix.",

            "content": "\"The Matrix Resurrections\" is the fourth installment in the highly popular and beloved \"Matrix\" franchise. The film is directed by Lana Wachowski and stars Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Neil Patrick Harris, among others.\n\nThe plot of the film follows Thomas \"Neo\" Anderson (Keanu Reeves), who is now a shell of his former self, living a mundane life as a game developer. However, Neo soon discovers that his previous life in the Matrix may not have been a dream after all, and that he must once again fight against the machines to save humanity.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of the film is the outstanding performances by the cast. Keanu Reeves once again shines in his role as Neo, delivering a performance that is both nuanced and powerful. Carrie-Anne Moss also impresses in her return as Trinity, bringing a much-needed sense of emotional depth to the film.\n\nThe action sequences in the film are also incredibly well done. From the breathtaking fight scenes to the awe-inspiring visual effects, \"The Matrix Resurrections\" delivers on the excitement that fans have come to expect from the franchise.\n\nHowever, The Matrix Resurrections falls short compared to the original, and there are also some notable weaknesses in the film. The pacing of the story feels a bit uneven at times, with some scenes dragging on while others feel rushed. Additionally, the film's attempts to explore new themes and ideas, while admirable, can come across as heavy-handed and confusing at times.\n\nOverall, \"The Matrix Resurrections\" is a solid addition to the franchise, with some truly standout moments and performances. While it may not be as groundbreaking or memorable as the original film, it is still an enjoyable and thrilling ride for fans of the series.",

Very rarely are movie-goers treated to a perfect homage to a revisited franchise, while adding a fresh take and perspective on the source materials. Here is the idea of literally resurrecting a franchise, explored through a film. A perfect commentary for the current state of big motion pictures in this film era. Resurrections is like both a reboot and a sequel, in that several characters' actor portrayals are rebooted, while at the same time keeping in tact their original story-line from the original trilogy. This makes for an interesting reflection of self and identity. Hate to sound woke, but as we know, the Wachowskis have always explored what it means to be you and your definition of yourself. The matrix franchise has constantly explored having an identity that's incongruous with how others perceive you. Lana was able to continue the story of the original trilogy while also introducing new actors, unlike many requels that simply bring back the old, tired cast, or recast a bunch of gen-zers. So why isn't Hugo Weaving playing Agent Smith, or Lawrence Fishburne playing Morpheus? The film addresses that. They are deceased. The Morpheus in Resurrections is an NPC designed by Neo that became self-aware after Neo programmed him with that ability. The Agent Smith in Resurrections is a new Smith created by The Analyst because it became clear to him while creating the new Matrix that there was a special bond between Neo and Smith; basically, one cannot exist without the other. I wager that many people dissatisfied with the film do not actually know these plot points, which is still arguably the fault of the filmmakers, but it's not completely unsubstantiated by the screenplay and lore. It's possible that those audience members who despise the film are in fact, living in the newly created matrix.",

I don't even think it hurts anything that the cast has changed. It keeps itself interesting, and is no more of a miss than the film before it. I'd say watch it.

To alleviate this I rewatched the third one as a refresher, along with my cat shengy. Upon completion of aforementioned third installment I strongly felt this was two hours of my life I would never get back, but still held a glint of hope for resurrections to right these wrongs. It did not. The wachowski family now owe me another two hours of irretrievable down time. In retroflection, I now also feel the second film nowhere nearly stood up to the magnitude and ground breaking cinematography of the original, which I feel was amazing.

It feels like they expected the original stars (Reeves and Moss) to carry all the weight of keeping fans interested but as much as I loved the original movies and the cast. It was the inception style narrative where fans are left with more questions than answers in the original (making fans want to watch them again and again to get a deeper understanding with each viewing) But this film is so far from that and really feels like such a major flop while missing a major mark on the necessity for a captivating story. I would have given only one star but Reeves, Moss, and NPH are excellent actors.",

Me parece que el principal divisior de esta película esta en que puede llegar a ser un poco pretenciosa, profundizando demás los diálogos y haciendolos confusos sin razón. No hay un planteamiento real que justifique todos los diálogos en la película, muchos se seinten forzados y de más en la cinta, como si se basaran en la superficialidad para crear capas en la historia; llegando a precer en varios momentos diálogos irónicos. Como la escena del la pélea en la que hay un personaje que dice cosas al aire para \"maticar\" el conflicto exterior de la cinta con WB, que desde mi punto de vista no me parece ingenioso tener como conflicto principal, un conflico personal del autor, que solo entenderá el espectador que este al tanto de las noticias de esta película, ojo todos los directores (o la gran mayoría) modifican echos reales para crear su historia, hasta en la misma cinta se hace referencia, pero el problema está en que Lana Wachowski no exteriorisa su porpio conflico, no lo adapta a la historia, lo hace parecer como un berrinche, el discurso no se amolda a la trama y no se siente natural, y ojo conflico externo si crea una buena trama que va más allá de ser algo externo para profundizar la película, ya que es más fácil que el público entienda el mensaje o lo capte, porque un conflico externo afecta a todos. Para mi la trama se basa más en la busqueda el empoderamiento interno y en forjar nuestra identidad sin inspirarnos o imitar las tendencias (Libera tu mente), con la ya crítica al capitalismo que las demás cintas venian arrastrando, con una que otra alegoría interesante. Con lo que me quedo en esta película está en el montaje, cada escena ya sea de exposición del conflico o de acción, tiene planos interesantes que se hacen muy dinámicos con la historia, que se agradece sobre todo en las escenas de acción, con una paleta de colores oscuras y furtes en la que prioriza el azul que me pareció hermosa, no me aburrí de ella en toda la película, y para mi le da una profundidad en la imágen muy interesante que se vuelve agradable y en varios momentos impactánte de ver.\n\nPara Mi Matrix 4 se hizo como una crítica a la sobre explotación de contenido actual, con Reboots y contenidos sin originalidad que buscan ser más un entretenimiento masivo sin una cara real, que una producción que busque darle un mensaje al espectador, que en varios momentos funciona pero en otros no, más allá de la fotografía esta 4 entrega no tiene otro apartado en el que sobresalga, Matrix 4 podrá ser original pero sin contar una historia que realmente sobresalga de toda la masividad de contendio que tenemos actualmente.",

            "content": "The 1999 \"Matrix\" was not a good film, it was the standard for a good film. The original idea was so good that it held on two sequels that, with all their imperfections, together form a unique trilogy. Unfortunately, we also received the fourth half-sequel, half-remake of the mentioned movie, which, if it had any spirit, could be called a parody rather than a serious film. But, we have what we have, now at least we got a standard for a bad movie, and an example of what kind of movies should not be made. It has already become proverbial for Hollywood to record \"woke\" propaganda, instead of slightly watchable and entertaining achievements.\n\nTo paraphrase a line from the film that best describes the reason for this misdeed itself: \"Warner Brothers decided to shoot a sequel to the Matrix trilogy, with or without us.\" Surprisingly honest, nothing else to say. Apart from the original John Wick, pardon, Neo and Trinity, the rest of the cast consists of comic characters who, all together, can hardly bear the epithet of actors. The script and dialogues, on the other hand, are written in such a way that no serious acting would help.\n\nThe vain repetition of scenes already seen (and literally), a patched plot full of holes without any meaning, rather bad effects and a change of the original coloring are just some of the troubles this film is dealing with. It was also expected that the original story will be altered, so we find out that Neo is actually not the only \"One\", but that they are, in fact, Neo and Trinity, but, above all, Trinity. Everything in this film goes downhill, from the very beginning to the uninspiring ending. Cheap, just as check-out music is cheap compared to the original by RATM.\n\nIf you only can, don't waste time with this movie. It is better to spend it, for example on \"Spiderman: No Way Home,\" and see how a fun sequel to a franchise can be recorded, with an original approach and a real look back at previous sequels. I am far from favoring so-called actors like Tom Holland or Zendaya, but the film is at least craftily done properly.\n\nThe only sympathies for this film are for reminding us how good the first \"Matrix\" was, by showing scenes from the original realization about every five minutes. And that's probably because there is nothing better to see here anyway.",

            "content": "It was a daring idea to create a sequel to The Matrix that actually doesn't feel like a Matrix movie. The goal here is to reference the franchise legacy but still look like a new original experience. The idea sounds good but here it doesn't really work as the movie itself doesn't know what to be instead of a Matrix movie. A lot of the movie feels like an afterthought, lacking enough development. There is one particular moment when a character of the previous movie appears in the most random way screaming things that do feel like an improvisation while staying out of any interaction with the main cast before disappearing for good. The main villains disappoint too. Jonathan Groff doesn't have the same level of intimidation as Hugo Weaving, which is a big miss for the movie. There is another new villain too but he has too much personality and human quirk to feel like a \"mean program\". At one point, this same villain talks about having \"inside jokes\" but with who? how robots can have inside jokes? The action scenes can be fun but most of them don't live up to the memorable level of the other Matrix movies. That said, the action still is a good diversion after some very long and boring explanations that are too present in the movie. The movie is still worthy of your time if you liked the franchise, the scene between Neo and Trinity are great, their chemistry and their acting are amazing. Trinity especially shines in each of her appearances. Also, the new character, Bug, played by Jessica Henwick, is a very fun one and a pretty good addition to the franchise. Also the main theme this time is that people want to live in their own world, their mind, instead of facing reality which is pretty good for a movie that is so meta towards the first movie where the theme was the possible fakeness of our reality but Revolution doesn't develop this theme despite talking few times about it. Don't expect too much though, as many people thought, this movie seems to be the beginning of a new franchise. In Matrix Revolution, only a few things will be resolved by the end of the movie, and some important obstacles will be a little too easily cleared.",

My biggest complaint is that i didnt like the casting of Johnathan Groff, i think hes a great actor just not a great fit for the role he got. I also really enjoyed all the sense8 cast in the film and some off the small nods to the show.",

There are talented people in this movie that look awful because of the aforementioned pace and the directing.  The director should fire herself.  It definitely reeks of someone that doesn't seem to have much interest in the project.\n-The rumor (and unsuccessful lawsuit) that much of the original script was ripped off from pitched scripts like the ones for Altered Carbon is looking to have more legs now than it did.  If this is what comes from the \"original\" creation of either Wachowski (or both), then they probably stole most of their success.\n\nSomeone actually mentioned the flop Jupiter Ascending as one of Lana's projects.  Compared to this, that movie is highly enjoyable.  This one is borderline torture for anyone that actually cares about the original masterpieces.\n\nAnd NO, it's not clever.

I was absolutely blown away by this film and it is certainly one of my all time favorites. The sequels were not quite as good but definitely still had their moments of action, intrigue, and spectacle. After seeing Resurrections I'm now convinced that they never should've gone beyond the original. Resurrections makes Revolutions look like Citizen Kane, despite all the flaws the trilogy's finale had. I knew this latest entry to the series was not going to be as good as the original trilogy, but nothing could've prepared me for how bad this movie actually was.\n\nThe first red flag is the fact that this film has to constantly remind you of how much better the first film was. About a third of the film is either trying to sloppily recreate the most iconic scenes and imagery of the first film, or is literally just showing you those scenes within the film. Then there's all the \"meta\" self-awareness the film has, which could have been a clever plot device but is done in such a painfully cringy way that it feels like they don't want you to take this film seriously. Neo's powers are completely nerfed and it's pretty obvious that Keanu is now too old to do kung fu. Agent Smith and Morpheus are just cheap knock-offs of Weaving and Fishburne, and I can't blame those two for not wanting to return to this trainwreck of a sequel. Instead of the Architect we have the \"Analyst\" who is an actual exposition machine and explains any necessary plot points when the story needs to move forward. There are a lot of cool ideas like a machine civil war that get briefly mentioned and then are never spoken of again, even though these could've been fascinating concepts to explore. The new characters are like forgettable NPCs, which is fitting considering that the film's first angle is to say the Matrix was just a video game. They even introduce one of the most cliche concepts they could possibly throw into this franchise, zombies. Yes that's right, there are now zombies in the Matrix. You might be wondering if at least the action is any good... well, it isn't. The fight choreography also feels like a huge downgrade from the entire Matrix trilogy.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this movie, from the script, to the casting, to the execution, and so on. It's a nostalgia-bait cash-grab that destroys everything the franchise had worked to achieve, and based on Lana Wachowski's statements this was probably intentional. I understand wanting to make a commentary about the film industry, sequels, etc., but that could've been accomplished without creating such a disjointed mess. This is one of the most disappointing sequels ever made, if not the worst sequel in the history of film. I'd prefer to be like Neo and believe that this movie is not real.",

            "content": "Idiosyncratic notion: C. It was energizing, philosophical, testing, and made a moment brand out of the Wachowskis, the composition/coordinating kin who had already guided one non-mainstream film. The Matrix sequels, Reloaded and Revolutions, became a shorthand joke for swollen imaginative error. They were talkative, draggy, and simply not what fans were expecting to see when jacking once again into this bizarre world, and years after the fact, I believe they're worth a basic re-assessment. The Matrix Resurrections just made me miserable. A film feels angry at its own initiation. Thomas Anderson is carrying on with his life as an honor-dominating match originator. His organization and colleague, Smith, are searching for their next success, and they're taking a gander at Anderson's greatest achievement... the \"grid set of three.\" It was a computer-generated simulation program that speared the distinction between the real world and fiction. Mr. Anderson could play or even put together the part of Trinity with respect to Tiffany, a lady he has become charmed by over the long run at a bistro. But Mr. Anderson is experiencing difficulty figuring out what is genuine and what is just in his mind. That is on the grounds that a new, more youthful Morpheus is letting him know that he's Neo, that he's bound for more prominent things, and that he's been kept in a strange jail to keep him out of the activity. What is the reason for this, and what has happened in the long time since the end of the conflict with the machines? Part of my battle with Resurrections is that it also battles with its own reality, and not in a meta-text based kind of character emergency, more like a motivation to carry on 18 years after the fact. This film is far more meta than you might think. The whole first hour of the film highlights characters advocating rebooting \"The Matrix,\" the game. It's a film where characters loquaciously discuss parent organizations' going ahead with the IP regardless of the inclusion of the first makers, so it's better to be the one attempting to resolve the drain, I assume. A person, in a real sense, says Warner Brothers needs another Matrix and they won't stop until they get one. There are characters that lounge around a table and attempt to separate what made the first Matrix so bleeding edge, and each individual has an alternate brand trademark. There are strict minutes from the 1999 film that are introduced as though the characters in the framework are watching The Matrix to reproduce scenes like energetic cosplayers. There is one section where a person simply begins shouting \"reboot\" with irreverent expectation, promising to get their own side project as a danger. Media outlets' parody about reboots and cash-get continuations is interesting yet lost and coming according to a viewpoint of insubordination. In the event that this was all the film was, it would have been an intriguing illustration of a craftsman's wearing the extension to their best establishment out of obstinate disdain. In any case, assuming we had our own little center gathering and asked what made the first Matrix so agreeable, I question whether anybody would list, \"media outlet parody and meta humor.\" We have another Morpheus and another Mr. Smith, but did we really need either of them? Whenever they make a cursory effort to design themselves after characters of old, it feels stressed, it feels gassed, and it's another example where Wachowski broadcasts to her crowd, \"Look, the studio requested I bring back these characters, but I'll be doomed assuming I know how to manage them.\" As a result, Morpheus has somewhat more story influence as an impetus for taking Neo back to his way of edification. In all honesty, I don't actually know half of what was going on in this film, which comes up short on the rich availability of the best activity motion pictures, connecting circumstances and logical results, and pushing the film forward to its unavoidable conclusion. Indeed, even the earlier films felt more like the makers realized what was happening, regardless of whether the crowd was lingering behind. With Resurrections, it seems like Wachowski and her screenwriters, author Dave Mitchell and Aleksandar Hermon, have recently quit any pretense of attempting to sort out everything. Another failure is the absence of any signature or vital activity groupings or, in the expressions of the Matrix round table, minutes that \"took your breath away.\" The utilization of telephones as transport all through the grid has been supplanted with reflect entrances and entryways, which at first let my imagination run wild. It also feels like another component that scarcely enrolls. The film takes the anybody-can-turn-into-an-agent danger of the first set of three. The new machines choose to depend upon a collective conscience means of getting anything people are nearby and assuming command over them as careless troopers. Let's look into what kind of minimization this is. The last venture includes a heightening of the collective conscience, yet we've previously been here with the numerous Agents Smiths of the continuations. There is one upsetting change-up where the machines acknowledge how people can simply act as standard feed. That is dull. However, it is a more viable assault. Indeed, even the essential combative techniques like fights and gravity-challenging wire work are modest this round. Assuming there is one thing that resurrections truly do well, it's marking their character out as a sentiment. A significant part of the last part focuses on the connection between Neo and Trinity, which was generally underestimated in the spin-offs. It was a sentiment of more utilitarian reason, giving Neo an affectionate interest to persuade him to be saved in the midst of incredible risk. The film Resurrections really carves out an opportunity to devote to Neo and Trinity as individuals with desires and what they would see as engaging about each other. He's not the hero of humanity, and she's not his entryway to information and strengthening. They are portrayed as individuals who are somewhat dissatisfied with their lives and simply hoping for another chance to meet at their favorite coffee shop for another energizing discussion. The development of the film puts much more significance on this human association, so I'm happy time has at long last been given to investigate what it is that interfaces Trinity and Neo, particularly assuming their romantic tale will play as conspicuous a goal as Resurrections. On the off chance that you have never thought often about Trinity and Neo as a couple, you'll probably be in for a brief half-life. From a specialized viewpoint, resurrections are still a banquet for the faculties. The photography is ill-humored and airy. The melodic score is siphoning. The embellishments are cutting-edge. There are a ton of gifted individuals dealing with this continuation. So why then, at that point, does the film feel so spur of the moment? In some respects, every Matrix continuation has had this impression, adding incidental pieces to a generally amazing independent film. Having re-watched both Reloaded and Revolutions once more, I can positively pronounce Resurrections to be the most fragile Matrix passage yet. We were all all too unforgiving of the earlier two Matrix motion pictures, which missed the mark in catching the first's enchanted speculative chemistry, but brought the products with regard to noteworthy set pieces, eye-popping visuals, and account zigs rather than zooms. They are still all too stodgy and babble nonsensically, but there are distinct major ideas permeating under them. Conversely, Resurrections feels more fueled by disdain, with Wachowski's returning to this world against her better wishes and decisions. Perhaps we ought to have let things be.",

It ties everything in perfectly with the present time. Sad, that people do not understand this.

The conflicting reviews are what made me give it a chance. I could not believe this movie could have a love hate reaction. I still cannot believe the criticism of the movie considering how important the backstory played in making the movie. After 20 minutes the new feel, definition, and cinematics felt right for this movie. The romance and how it affected the outcome was very well done.

However, a lot of people with crippling movie addictions saw it as something else entirely, a creative and surprisingly subversive evolution of the original that asked new questions about the nature of creativity and ideation. After setting my hopes rather low, I lean much more heavily towards the latter. Yes, Agent Smith is now a tech bro douche because they couldn't get Hugo Weaving back and anyone trying to imitate him would have fallen short. But the movie was willing to take risks where it could have played it safe by just bringing back every face that made the original a classic, leaning slightly on the love for the original but expanding the questions regarding free will and in particular, our own certainty. \n\nIdeally, I would have hoped that the fight scenes would have activated the stupid action movie-happy part of my brain a bit more, and that some of the character designs were a bit more restrained, and that the choices made by our protagonists carried a bit more weight.

            "content": "A nostalgia fueled revisit of The Matrix that's very hit or miss.\n\nDirector Lana Wachowski's sci-fi action-adventure The Matrix Resurrections (2021) is a good movie that I enjoyed much of, while absolutely loathing certain choices. Wachowski's direction only has that sleek neo-noir style from The Matrix during the scenes within The Matrix, while the real world segments feel dull for Io just like Zion from Reloaded and Revolutions. I do appreciate Lana Wachowski returning to direct with some style of her own and providing some heart to this story. However, The Matrix Resurrections has as many problems as it has enjoyable scenes.\n\nProduction designers Hugh Bateup and Peter Walpole beautifully recreate The Machine City and people pods, while The Matrix office and cafe sets sucks horribly. Io looks just like Zion: hideous. Some of the visual effects are remarkable like hands going through mirrors, machines plugging into people, characters appearing or morphing suddenly. However, the bullet dodge CGI and slowing down effects look cheap and rough. How can The Matrix effects look worse now than 20 years ago?\n\nEditor Joseph Jett Sally's montages cutting back and forth between the old Matrix movies and the new ones are obnoxious and terrible. Generally, the editing is dull and unimaginative without real tension or pacing in mind. The Matrix Resurrections starts with an unbearable first 40 minutes with insufferable new characters that could easily have been cut. It did not need to be 148 minutes long at all. The Matrix Resurrections could have had a quick montage to demonstrate that Neo is unhappy in The Matrix and felt like reality was not real, then gets the red pill from Morpheus and gets to the interesting plot. I hated the opening, loved the middle section of The Matrix Resurrections that has new plot, places, and ideas, then felt cold about the lackluster ending.\n\nI hated how the conversations are shot like television episodes, yet there are some striking wide shots with real mood from cinematographers John Toll and Daniele Massaccesi. Neo rising from the machine pods or walking in the rain at night look incredible like the original Matrix films. However much of the martial arts fight choreography is basic and not thrilling like the old kung fu. The gun shootouts are pretty dull and the final riot attack is pretty boring. This should have been so easy to look and feel cool! The fast paced, action packed, and brilliant science-fiction sequences are just not here within The Matrix Resurrections.\n\nThis movie was obviously mandated by Warner Brothers, so Lana Wachowski directed and wrote what she could come up with to not let them create something completely terrible. Instead, we got a creative movie with some fresh sci-fi ideas, bland action, half awful acting, and a jaded perspective.\n\nWriters Lana Wachowski, David Mitchell, and Aleksandar Hemon clearly resent Warner Brothers as well as fans of The Matrix for wanting another Matrix sequel. The meta references and jokes are horrendous, unfunny, unimaginative, confusing, and hurt the otherwise serious tone of The Matrix movies. The Matrix Resurrections carries a contrived, jaded, and cynical perspective without much hope compared to The Matrix Trilogy. Neo and Trinity's romance needed to be developed further as we barely got any Carrie-Anne Moss until the end! I kind of loved how the machines resurrect and recreate Neo and Trinity's bodies. This film needed more interesting ideas like that or humanity's last remaining city Io living in harmony with humans and machines. I do not appreciate Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, or even the actress that played Sati not getting to return to their respective characters. Their absence is notable.\n\nKeanu Reeves is pretty good as Neo once more in The Matrix Resurrections. He's sometimes really awkward or bored, but he delivers a serious and thoughtful performance as Neo realizes the consequences of what he's done or how the world changed or didn't. Neo should have been allowed to fight with some complex kung fu more as there's very little action surprisingly. He's still got romantic chemistry with Carrie-Anne Moss, but they needed more screen-time together. She has not aged a day really as Carrie-Anne Moss is absolutely gorgeous still and a cool heroine with her iconic Trinity. Carrie-Anne Moss is fantastic as Trinity once she gets to fight, but she's wasted having her pretend to be Tiffany. Hopefully, if there is somehow a fifth Matrix film, Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss can be together the entire film.\n\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II is serious and gripping as Morpheus, but I just wish Laurence Fishburne was asked back as his iconic black hero. Morpheus' fight with Neo in the water dojo is pretty neat. Jessica Henwick is wonderful, beautiful, and cool as Bugs. I wish she wasn't forgotten about by the end and given an even bigger role as she's charismatic, cool, and funny. She gets how to make Bugs feel intriguing and strong with a worry for the future as she believes in Neo like the old Morpheus. I am certainly surprised at how cute and fun Jessica Henwick is in The Matrix Resurrections. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Jessica Henwick are definitely pleasant standouts from The Matrix Resurrections as far as the new cast is concerned.\n\nJonathan Groff is so average as Agent Smith. He does not have Hugo Weaving's charismatic delivery, heavy enunciation, distinct voice, fearsome presence, or captivating gravitas. I could not help but think how cool every line of Smith's would sound if he was played by Hugo Weaving again. Neil Patrick Harris is fairly gripping and often funny as The Analyst. He's a great improvement on The Architect's obnoxious personality and dense dialogue. Priyanka Chopra sounds like she's just reading her lines off the script. She's the worst performance in the entire movie and I'm shocked she was used to help promote it at all. They should have gotten the Indian girl who originally played Sati so charmingly. She could not possibly be worse than Priyanka.\n\nChristina Ricci looks breathtaking and she's so funny! How does she only get like two lines of dialogue then she disappears? She would have been way better than any other person in The Matrix. They could have at least made her character Gwyn de Vere an agent or something. Jada Pinkett Smith is both engaging and awful as a newly jaded Niobe. She's not brave or loyal at all anymore. Telma Hopkins is okay as researcher Freya. Chad Stahelski is terrible as Chad, but it's a quaint cameo, I guess. Lambert Wilson is surprisingly terrible and raving as The Merovingian. He used to be one of the best parts of Reloaded and Revolutions. Brian J. Smith's Berg is boring. Toby Onwumere's Sequoia is somehow worse than Tank or Link. Max Riemelt is likable as Sheperd, but he does nothing. Eréndira Ibarra's Lexy is very pretty and rather emotional, so I'm surprised she's barely used in The Matrix Resurrections. Andrew Lewis Caldwell truly awful as the meta spewing game design dork Jude. He's unbearable. Honestly, half the cast is insufferable, while the half that is great are underused.\n\nComposers Tom Tykwer and Johnny Klimek's score is underwhelming, honestly. I miss the grand symphonic pieces from Don Davis or Juno Reactor's exciting techno songs. Where are all the exciting, beautiful, or memorable themes or melodies? Surely they could have had pulsing synths or something for The Matrix Resurrections? Sound design is both corny and slick with some robots sounding neat and other action sounds coming across as goofy. Lindsay Pugh, Caroline Hill, and Javier Arrieta's costumes are so boring and ugly compared to any of Kym Barrett's classic Matrix outfits. Where is all the leather, latex, and black fabrics? This looks so ugly and modern. The make-up team ensures everyone looks older, that's for sure.\n\nIn short, I'm not impressed by the overall execution, but I appreciate The Matrix Resurrections ambition. I wish it had more striking visuals like the actual resurrection or thrilling action like Neo fighting Morpheus.",

It reminded me of what Space Jam: New Legacy was, just one big promo for Warner Bros. As soon as they said \"our partner, Warner Bros want a sequel\" I just wanted to die.\n\nAt first, I thought it was an interesting way to imprison Neo, by making him think he was the video game designer of The Matrix and everything that happened in the first three movies was all in his head. However the writing and the scenes were dumb, I had to cover my eyes. It felt like everything the first three movies did was for nothing.\n\nThen eventually it started to feel like a Matrix sequel in the second act, once Neo got brought back. It was cool that Keanu shaved his head for it, it really felt like Neo was truly back. However, when we met the secondary characters. I really didn't like most of them. They always feel like they have to add a cast of young secondary characters to make the movie seem more 'with the times'? I've never thought Jessica Henwick was a good actress, she didn't feel like a Matrix character. I'm sure those who have seen Sense8 noticed a few familiar faces though. Casting Jonathan Groff and Neil Patrick Harris were weird ones, because their faces aren't ominous in the slightest to be the villains, they just looked like regular dudes, repeating lines from the old movies, trying to be modern versions of The Architect and Agent Smith.\n\nWhat was funny about them constantly playing scenes from the old movies was that it reminded us how much better they were compared to what we were currently watching.\n\nWhat this movie lacked was the sophistication that the first few movies had. Instead of Neo and Trinity looking like bad asses, it was just messy action sequences with force pushes? Granted, Keanu Reeves seemed like one of the few people there actually putting some effort in, because alongside him was Carrie Anne-Moss, who didn't seem like she wanted to be there.\n\nThat brings me to the directing. I personally think the Wachowskis got super freaking lucky with the first Matrix being one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made. Some of the shots in this movie looked like shots you'd see in a behind-the-scenes featurette. The sets looked like movie sets and kind of low budget. It was all so poorly done that it kept taking me out of the experience.\n\nThis movie only felt like a Matrix movie when they were in the real world, but even then, the lack of that grittiness and the green-y filter made it feel like it was lacking The Matrix feel.\n\nI'll admit, the new human settlement looked great! That was all until Jada Pinkett-Smith entered the frame and we saw her terrible performance and the terrible old-person makeup done on her. It was painful to look at. Then on to explaining how Morpheus was there but also not there, really confused the hell out of me. It's like they didn't even know themselves why Lawrence Fishburne wasn't there, they just wanted to be able to have a character called Morpheus in the movie, but just played by someone else?\n\nSome visual and audio editing was also really shoddy. You could tell this was a rushed job that Warner Bros just wanted to get made. It was obvious to see all the red flags in the promo for this film, it didn't feel like the real deal. The Wachowskis haven't made a decent movie for a long time, why would one of them suddenly conjure up the skill to finally make a good movie? They should've just given the movie to someone else to make. But who knows, maybe this movie was doomed to fail either way, because you can tell that Warner Bros had some \"creative input\". And if different director were to failed, then the fans would complain and say the Wachowskis should've made it. After all, they created The Matrix world, but like George Lucas did with Star Wars, they ran a great thing into the ground by trying to build on it (but yes, Revenge of the Sith was incredible).",

The meta commentary about the entertainment industry and the contemporary landscape for artists in the age of corporate IPs was perhaps on the nose, but that doesn't make it any less relevant. And it was only the most obvious metaphor on display, with many deeper layers of symbolism and allegory going on. As a trans person, I was very touched by the potent allegories for our experience. And as a communist, I was blown away by the salient critiques of capitalist realism and the society of spectacle.

Also interesting to note that it was Germany that facilitated it, in the midst of entire world lockdown. As we all know, history never left, history is made up and history repeats itself, - that type are beat before and they are beat again, every time.
