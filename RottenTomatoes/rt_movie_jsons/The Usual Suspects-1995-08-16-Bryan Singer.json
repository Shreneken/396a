Kint attempts to convince the feds that the mythic crime lord not only exists, but is also responsible for drawing Kint and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro Harbor - leaving few survivors.",

It features surprises, action, and suspense that stays under-played rather than over-developed. I wouldn't let anyone ruin the ending for you, so be careful who you ask about this movie. It isn't the best thing in the universe, but if you don't know how it ends, it's fun. When I was younger this was my favorite movie of all time. It has aged pretty well, and the acting is outstanding from everyone involved in the project. The surprises are throughout the movie, making it fun to watch. Del Toro's performance especially, the scene where he pisses on the fire, and the ending make this a must-see.",

Fully deserving of its reputation as one of the best modern, and perhaps overall, films ever made. Not everybody is going to disagree and that is fine.\n\n'The Usual Suspects' is slickly and audaciously made, filmed with a lot of style and is atmospherically directed. It is also hauntingly scored. It is intricately and intelligently written by Christopher McQuarrie, some of the best screen-writing he ever did. It is beautifully and deftly directed by Bryan Singer. If remembered correctly, neither McQuarrie or Singer were well known at the time and it was 'The Usual Suspects' that put them on the map.\n\nFilm is famous for the iconic line-up scene, the noticeboard that haunts everybody forever and its killer twist, one for the ages and not one to forget in the long one. Twists have wildly varied in film, there are some ingenious ones but also some naff ones, 'The Usual Suspects' is one of the ingenious ones. 'The Usual Suspects' as said before doesn't just have its twist going for it. The flashback-packed story is similarly intricate and never feels muddled or convoluted.\n\nIt has some of the finest ensemble acting there has ever been. This is especially true for a mesmerising Kevin Spacey in one of the most deserved Oscar Wins that year. Spacey is just one of the all round brilliant performances. Pete Postelthwaite, an always dependable actor who is still very much missed, is suitably mysterious, and Dan Hedaya and Chazz Palminteri make their mark as the confused cops. Steven Baldwin doesn't have a particularly challenging role but has never been better, Gabriel Byrne is also solid.\n\nOverall, magnificent film in every sense.

Without giving away too much for the uninitiated, the action all centers around the existence (or myth) of the mysterious Keyser Soze, who one character summarizes by saying \u2018I believe in God and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze.'  The plot is labyrinthine but not impossible to follow, the cast is excellent, much of the dialogue is highly quotable, and the twist in the final scene is remarkable.  Unlike so many movies with twist endings, The Usual Suspects may actually be more engaging with additional viewings once you're aware of the story behind the Soze mystery.",

This movie was directed by Bryan Singer before he blew the minds of many comic book fans with a couple amazing X-Men-movies. Starring an impressive cast consisting of Benicio Del Toro, Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey and Stephen Baldwin, this movie had a lot going for it. It made some pretty big waves after its release and is now old enough to be considered a classic.\n\nA massive gunfight results in a veritable bloodbath and fire in the Los Angeles Harbor, causing an incredible loss of life. Verbal Kint, a professional con-man and full-time cripple, seems to be one of the only survivors of this disaster. He is apprehended and tells the story of the events leading up this debacle. Here, he eventually pins the blame on Keyser S\u00f6ze, a psychopathic and rutless kingpin, believed to be more of a mythical boogieman than an actual person.\n\nWhat makes this movie stand out- at least for me- is the entire mystery surrounding the character of Keyser S\u00f6ze. He is as imposing and threating, as he ethereal. This character throws a long shadow over the story that looms just beyond the limits of the screen. This makes the entertaining characters and heists they're pulling of even more interesting, as they are slowly being pulled into a maelstrom that could mean the end of them. Each role is masterfully played, as both Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne truly shine in their respective personas. \nWhile the movie has aged well in a narrative sense, its wrinkles are showing in its more simplistic sense of cinematography. Conversations are simple back-and-forths, establishing shots are pans. 'Suspects' could have used a bit more of a dynamic style to fit the ever-moving pace of the story.\nIt has some slower beats, that are mostly necessary for the pacing anyhow. \n\nI had a good time with this movie, and anyone that hasn't seen it can get my recommendation for it. Despite its age, I refuse to give away any spoilers, as its ending is iconic to say the least. \n'The Usual Suspects' receives an 8.5/10.",

As a screenwriter myself, I'm definitely taking notes on how to craft a satisfying ending that ties just enough up to be satisfying and still leaves you with a lot of questions. The last 15 minutes of the film alone are worth the price of admission.

While my wife did fall asleep watching it and I got a bit droopy-eyed around the middle, I really liked the Redfoot character, thought Palminteri nearly eclipsed Spacey's performance with his aggression and Spacey's narration was top notch. Best of all for me, and really what kept me awake through the uninteresting second act was the film score, which earned no awards recognition but to me was a near-masterpiece! It had my favorite elements of the best film scores I'd previously heard like Jerry Goldsmith's close mimicking of the action and tone of each scene and John Williams's grand scale and near-intrusive volume, exactly the way I like it. He kept to the deeper notes in all the right places and limited the fluttery keys that I'm not as big a fan of. The music during the plot twist of Spacey's other 1995 movie, Se7en, was better at heightening emotion and suspense, but leading up to the finale this score absolutely hit the spot. Given that the twist ending was perfectly done I'm left with a very uneven movie but with key ingredients that were done so well that I can't possibly give a low rating to the finished product.

Get on it. There's a reason it's one of the best in cinema history. Kevin Spacey (Roger \"Verbal\" Kint) gives one of the best performances of his career. You get shocked when the revelation comes at the end, but also are able to look back and see that it makes sense. The mystery around the film is well executed. You can tell that Verbal's story sounds fishy, so you're left wondering what the truth really is. Most of the other cast members also bring their best. Stephen Baldwin (Michael McManus), Gabriel Byrne (Dean Keaton), and Kevin Pollack (Todd Hockner) all do well. Benicio Del Toro (Fred Fenster) was a delightful addition. The way he talked throughout the film makes him memorable. The script is great and this might be the best work of Bryan Singer's career.\n\nWeaknesses: The criminals are mostly great characters. The cops aren't. They come across as very one note and generic, while getting next to nothing in terms of development. I know they aren't the most important piece of the film, but giving them something to work with would've helped things. The pacing of the movie could use some tightening. \n\nOverall: An absolute classic. It's filled with great, interesting characters and a wild tale that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The twists and turns throughout and especially at the end are the stuff of legend. Phenomenal.",

This movie follows on five usual suspects who are arrested for a trumped up charge on hijacked truck with guns. And wouldn't you know it? A mysterious crime lord who is Turkish named Keyser S\u00f6ze which I will not give information about that character. One of my favourite scenes from this movie is when those five criminals get arrested they have to say the tagline they've been given called \"Hand me the keys, you f\u00a3$king c**ksucker.\" This is the memorable line in the entire film.\n\nTodd Hockney: \"Hand me the keys, you f\u00a3$king c**ksucker.\"\nMichael McManus: \"Give me the f\u00a3$king keys, you f\u00a3$king c**ksucker, motherf\u00a3$ker...\"\nFred Fenster: \"Hand me the keys, you c**ksucker.\" Hand me the f\u00a3$king keys, you c**ksucker. What the f\u00a3$k?\"\nDean Keaton: \"Hand me the keys, you f\u00a3$king c**ksucker.\"\nVerbal Kint: \"Hand me the keys, you f\u00a3$king c**ksucker.\"\n\nThe characters what I get into is the one I love is The Usual Suspects and the only one I got into is Michael McManus played by Stephen Baldwin. Why is that? Well, he's hilariously cocky and smart mouthed and he says the tagline which I really love and I kinda laughed and chuckled at is my favourite line and that is, \"Give me the f\u00a3$king keys, you f\u00a3$king c**ksucker, motherf\u00a3$ker...\" and he does gets a good line. I guess the only factor here is that Kevin Spacey did a great performance as Verbal Kint and yes, he won an Oscar for that and he in the interrogation with Dave Kujan who asks Kint questions about Keyser S\u00f6ze, the dope on the boat and Dean Keaton. I once watched it just to concentrate on Kevin's performance through the entire film. Well, of course everybody remembers the most is the ending. It really adds a twist that who is the real Keyser S\u00f6ze and the fact that everyone believed it, it really is Keyser S\u00f6ze. Okay, now this is an thrill ride experience of The Usual Suspects. Best film of the year hands down. Great writing, great directing, great pacing, great characters, great editing and one great twist ending. This is a fantastic film. I really enjoyed this.",

John Ottman's score is composed with a little touch of horror on the thrillers' impressions but is very helpful for what's offered from the plot itself. \"The Usual Suspects\" without Kevin Spacey also feels like a movie that has nothing special in it and this is what makes the whole film claim to make Kevin Spacey's name more of a mysterious character in that year. Today, it's just a gimmick but you can appreciate this film with a different perspective.",

It's a story of much complexity with a lot of dialogue. This, in combination with the big lack of character depth might seem like a big flaw, but the 3rd act explains a lot of this and it does weigh more than the film's cons -- for some people. I loved the ending but found most of the 1st and 2nd act slow and uneventful. The third act made the whole flick superbly better, mostly thanks to the film's mysterious antagonist, the powerful direction by Bryan Singer and Kevin Spacey's performance as the character 'Verbal'. It's one great and dramatic thriller, but that might be a bit too slow for my taste.\n\nPersonal rating: 72/100\nCritical rating: 80/100",

A group of 'suspects' are arrested by the New York Police Department on pretty dubious information regarding a stolen truck and end up in the notorious identity parade.\nBack in a holding cell the group of 5 hatch a plan for further criminal activity to get one over the NYPD.\nAll the story is told from the interrogation of one of the suspects Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey).\nThe identity of a mysterious boss Keyser S\u00f6se becomes a main plot thread throughout. \nThe cast includes Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Stephen Baldwin and a young Benicio Del Toro.\nThe film oozes quality and was deserving of its box office success back in 1995.",

It's a more or less basic common plot, nothing special there, but became known for the twist ending and narrative, as well as the movie that won Kevin his Oscar for best actor, a title he deserves. The acting and script here are good, combined with a good pace and great deal of unknowns, that you have to watch closely to catch anything that may be hidden in the dialogue.  The action is amusing and decent, with an older than 1995 feel with the sound and bullet effects, but it's fun to watch and pretty well done, but at the end of the day we are here for the mystery and the twist ending.  Although I did have a good idea of how it was gong to happen, I must say even then I had my doubts, so obviously Spacey did his job well.  Overall it was a good movie, should have watched it sooner.",

Also, during the last shot of the movie when Keyser Soze says \"And like that... He's gone\" and then it cuts to black in my opinion was the perfect way to end the movie.

            "content": "I think there's something to be said about movies that can create an experience, but only based on certain conditions. For instance, I have told friends who didn't see Gravity in theaters not to waste their time on it. The experience of Gravity is one of a kind but almost entirely dependent on a huge screen (with 3-D if possible) to fully appreciate. Similarly, I believe that the full experience of The Usual Suspects only comes when you are able to see it unspoiled. Sadly, I knew the spoiler 20 years ago before even thinking of going to see the film. So, the question is, how does it hold up for someone who sees it for the first time with full knowledge of the conclusion? I thought it was a decent film, with some good plot twists that I didn't mind knowing in advance. This allowed me to look under the hood a little and see how they made the story work in order to blow the minds of audiences everywhere. I had some issues with the casting, because this group of crooks feel more like the light-hearted team from an Ocean's film than the dangerous group of killers in a drama like The Usual Suspects, but the 3 leads (Spacey, Byrne, and Palminteri) were all spectacular. The plot is kind of confusing at first because there are a lot of time jumps and sudden cuts from one location to another, but eventually it all smooths out and becomes easy to follow. My biggest issue with the film is also a big spoiler, so be warned.\n\n*SPOILERS START*  Because it is all told from the viewpoint of an unreliable narrator, we never get to find out exactly what happened. It makes for a big revelation at the end of the film, so I'm sure audiences walked out of the theater stunned without caring about that part. However, when you know the conclusion, it makes the entire film feel like a cheat because everything or nothing we saw could have happened and we don't have any idea.  *SPOILERS END*  Despite my complaints, I think The Usual Suspects is a solid script, that accomplished what it set out to do brilliantly. It will never be a favorite for me because I didn't get the full experience, but I can see why others hold it aloft as one of the greats. I'll just say this, if you like a good crime mystery film and you have no idea who or what Keyser Soze is, then you owe it to yourself to check out this movie because you might still be able to have the experience I was robbed of 20 years ago.",

The film opens in San Pedro California the night before where Dean Keaton one of our main characters is shot in cold blood on a boat in the harbor. The plot centers around McManus, Todd, Dean, Verbal Kint and Fenster as they collude to commit heist and crimes of assorted sorts. A mysterious man known simply as Mr. Soze is the mastermind behind an intricate plan to control the crime syndicates around the city of NY. To many he is only a myth, and a legendary tale but to others he is as real as it gets. After they all are arrested in NYC 6 weeks prior to current events they are all questioned to vet and see if they are the right men for the job. Based on their abilities to hijack cars and guns they are pre-picked to complete the operations. In the meantime the NYPD interrogates them to see if they can get information on one of the fugitives Keaton who is facing several indictments. However, as the movie transpires the story thread is not what it seems and we are led down a complicated and at times convoluted plan to shake the cops and carry out a sinister plan. The mission that is being analyzed throughout is the event that led to the death of 27 men for $91 million men and only the survival of one known as Verbal Kint. He was the brains behind the operations and an Agent Kujan is tasked to crack the case. With immunity offered to Kint the different operations that led to the smuggle of ammo out of South America and the heist against Saul for his cash and jewels is never quite pinned. After they meet the lawyer Mr. Kobayashi later in the film they are set on paying their debts back to Mr. Kyzer Soze who has entire files on their criminal pasts. One interesting foreshadow occurs when the lawyers states, \"one cannot be betrayed if you know no people.\" Later when we figure out that Kint is Mr. Soze after attempting to fool the detective and blackmailing his partners this statement makes more sense. Also Kint states, \"The greatest trick that the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.\" What is truly fascinating is this allusions leads us to figure out that Kint is that devil and has been the mastermind behind the whole charade throughout the film. Kint makes everything up and he is a conman in every sense of the word. As a cripple he is able to blackmail, threaten and deceive others who would never expect it. The resolution is a huge shock and makes the convoluted plot payoff as it was very well done. The social commentary of the film seems to point at corruption with the corporate system as well as the police force as Kujan undertakes some dastardly techniques to intimidate and get information from Kint. However, the film's story is original and brilliant in handling each twist and turn. Although this film covers the hunting group of companions archetype since they all are in on the crimes I think that it doesn't quite fit as Kint is manipulated the system the whole time. I think it would be better as man v. monster as the other men are just doing a job but Kint has more insidious plans.",

            "content": "There are disappointing moments within a film critic's lifetime during which they realize that a specific review won't have much influence on the people interested in, or in love with, a film.  Granted, I've never expected to change someone's opinion - more important to me is the art of the recommendation, where a previously clouded masterpiece is able to briefly become new again.  \n\tSo movies like 1995's \"The Usual Suspects\" are disheartening.  So legendary is it for its shadowy pulp cool and stellar twist ending that most audiences figure it to be a companion piece to the \"Pulp Fictions\" and \"L\u00e9on: The Professionals\" of the era.  But as long as a plot twist defines the success of a movie and is rather predictable, then my reverence can't be bought.  \n\tI can see its appeal - audiences tend to like having a plot pulled out like a rug from under their feet so they can feel the effects of a mind explosion - but I, more than once, found myself underwhelmed, confused, or, worst of all, not much interested in what it had to provide.  The storyline, so richly complicated and defined by its characters, builds and builds to an ending that feels like a copout.  \n\tWhat is it about \"The Usual Suspects\" that bothers me so much? Is it its excessive amount of characters, the way it feverishly convolutes its story, the way it never really sells the premise it eventually tries to slip us wholesale? I'm not so sure; it's a lethal cocktail of technical and performative mastery combined with potential that always lets itself be known but never materializes, with audience piano playing that sometimes impresses, but, more or less, hits a lot of wrong notes.\n\tIt begins with promise.  A catastrophic explosion shakes a San Pedro ship, leaving 27 men dead, $91 million of cocaine gone, and two survivors battling the aftermath.  One of them is horribly burned, hardly able to aid investigators; the other, Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a talkative cripple, is relatively unscathed, his tendency to never sit quietly heightened by his paranoia.  Two detectives with persona agendas, Jack Baer (Giancarlo Esposito) and Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), stalk the scene.\n\tMost of the story is presented through the recollections of Verbal, whose testimony begins five days previously and involves four criminals, including dirty cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), suave thief Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), the linguistically challenged Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), and hijacker Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack).  The quintet becomes acquainted when they are brought in as suspects for a recent gun shipment robbery; none are guilty, all annoyed at their detaining.  When McManus makes them a proposition that includes intercepting the transport of a police-escorted smuggler, swiping his noteworthy loot in the process, support is universal.\n\tThe job is completed without a bead of sweat in sight, leading to the group characterizing their chemistry as something finer than most.  More jobs with bigger payoffs sounds much more rewarding.  They continue on a path of a criminality but are slowed when legendary (and always unseen) Hungarian crime lord Keyser S\u00f6ze enters the scene with a job that holds great financial reward but also great mortal risk - if unsuccessful, mass murder will ensue.\n\tThis assignment, of course, leads to the present day situation, where Verbal is a sole survivor and the police become heavyweights of baffled psyches.  Verbal's truths never seem as cemented as we would like them to be (he's a pathological liar and a victim of an unforgiving society), making for mangled narration that puzzles investigators just as much as it puzzles us.\n\tThe story is a brand of confusing that rarely works in the movies, the kind where labyrinthine storytelling tactics become too much; we find ourselves furrowing our brow, unsuccessfully trying to recount past details to land somewhere between enjoyability and comprehensibility.  To regally follow exactly what's going on is a feat I applaud anyone for mastering.  The lauded plot twist (is it that great, though?) is underwhelming because we never cared too much about what was going on anyway.\n\tSo while the performances are good and Singer's direction has moments of artful mastery, \"The Usual Suspects\" doesn't satisfy because we expect it to be so much more than it actually is - it promises to be a twisty story of murder and deceit that ends with an exclamation mark, but conversely proves itself as hysteria with an ellipsis at its tail.  But I wouldn't listen to me here; everyone loves \"The Usual Suspects\" so much that I currently act as the hater that stands on the sidelines cheering for the wrong team, alone.  It's all a matter of taste.",

        {
            "content": "Knowing the plot of this movie would probably be convoluted, I made a real effort to pay attention to everything. My mind has wandered before in complex stories like this; sometimes, paying more attention would've only slightly elevated a needlessly complicated story (True Detective season 2), but sometimes, paying more attention would've made me appreciate the story more (LA Confidential or Chinatown). So I was determined to make complexity a non-issue when it came to my enjoyment of this movie.\n\nI pretty much loved most of this movie. The directing is stylish and fun, and though much of the movie is talky, it didn't feel low on incident/action like some pre-2000s crime movies can. The dialogue is great, and I was interested in all the characters and the dynamics between the group. It reminded me of Reservoir Dogs, with all these guys and their different criminal histories and their different attitudes towards crime and murder all coming together to make some money. And though the first half or so of the movie is a little unfocused (though not in a bad way), I like that it pulls it together in the second half to reveal that the usual suspects have all unknowingly robbed Keyser Soze, this legendary figure. It's a fascinating plot, and I was interested in seeing where it was going.\n\nNow here's the twist, maybe the thing the movie is most known for: Verbal Kint was 'Keyser Soze' the whole time, and that his story is made up. I have a lot of problems with this twist, but the odd thing is, most of them I'm not sure are huge or not. The problem is that there's a lot of ambiguity with the ending as to how much of what came before it is real and how much is entirely fabricated. Let's work through this.\n\nTo begin with, I guessed pretty much from the beginning that Verbal was somehow not what he seemed, and when the mystery of Keyser Soze was introduced, I immediately figured it was actually Verbal. To be honest, that's not necessarily a fault with the movie; it's more because I knew there'd be a twist and so I was looking out for it. Besides, now, in 2015, so many plot twists have been recycled that to our twist-obsessed culture, looking back at a movie like this, the twist doesn't seem so novel. But I still kind of think there are a lot of clues in the movie. Kevin Spacey's performance is enjoyably off-kilter, and it's kind of clear that he's hiding something dark inside, especially when he ruthlessly kills Saul, which seems uncharacteristic based on his general wimpiness. And when there's seven minutes left in the movie and the only conclusion is 'Keaton actually did it,' you kind of wonder what else could happen. I mean, Keaton is dead, so there's nowhere else for the story to go, but there's the weird loose end of Verbal. Verbal in general feels slightly incidental in a way that indicates there's probably more to him than it seems. Anyways, the predictability of the twist isn't really a flaw, necessarily, but it explains why my mind wasn't insanely blown by the twist. (Fight Club, on the other hand, still managed to shock the hell out of me watching it long after it came out.)\n\nThe main problem with the twist, if it is even a problem, is that like I said, it's ambiguous how much of Verbal's story is true. If his entire story was made up, I'd be pretty pissed, honestly, because it'd make everything seem like a waste (this is kind of Roger Ebert's reasoning in his 1 and a half star review). The thing is, though, it seems like a lot of it is true; Kobiyashi shows up at the end to pick up Verbal, and it seems that the earlier scenes with him really did happen; his name just wasn't 'Kobiyashi.' In that case, if all the story is true and Verbal only fabricated the names and things that could serve him, it's a really solid twist. But it looks like the truth is somewhere in between; for example, you'd think based on the twist that Verbal was the one who killed all the usual suspects, but from Verbal's point of view, he was hiding the whole time. So how would he have killed Hockney? The probable answer, of course, is that he wasn't hiding out there the whole time; that was a lie he presented in his story. He probably was sneaking all around, killing each of them. And that leads to my final point...\n\nGenerally, what lowers this from 'loving' status to 'liking' status for me is that murkiness with the twist, but mostly because of one core reason: it feels like I'm being cheated a little when it's revealed that what I saw onscreen didn't actually happen. Is it really worth it to throw out a compelling, fun narrative just for the sake of a mind-bending twist (that isn't, I repeat, very unpredictable)? Of course, the twist doesn't completely throw out that story; most of it WAS true, probably, which is why I still really like this movie. But part of the fun in a suspense/mystery/thriller movie is that you get to look at the evidence onscreen and use it to figure out on your own what the truth might be. Watching Verbal hiding while Hockney was killed, I thought, \"Oh, I thought Verbal was going to kill them all! I guess I was wrong about the twist!\" I didn't realize that what we were seeing onscreen was literally only Verbal's story for the police, even if a lot of it was true. I was looking for little signs in the story that something was off, because THOSE kinds of foreshadowing are so much more powerful than when the onscreen action is a straight up lie. For example: I return to Verbal's uncharacteristic killing of Saul. That was unexpected, and it's a big clue to show that Verbal is more ruthless than he's letting on. But why would he so openly disclose that he killed Saul to the police? It's almost like the filmmakers wanted to try TWO ways of dropping hints: by giving little visual cues and foreshadowing within the context of Verbal's actual story, and by giving signs that what was happening onscreen wasn't real at all, but a distillation of Verbal's story to the police. As I've made clear, I much preferred the former way of foreshadowing.\n\nAll in all, despite my mixed feelings about the twist, I think it still mostly works without undoing much of what came before it besides some of the logic of the boat scene. It was full of witty dialogue, enjoyable characters, and suspense, and I'm glad I decided to really pay attention this time.",

It's also a rare case of a movie that's almost completely immune to the charge of having plot holes since the same revelation renders it all moot.  That might sound horrible ... I have often been annoyed by movies who's final twists makes you feel like you've wasted your time watching them ... but it's really not in this case.

Overall though, the engrossing story (written by Christpher McQuarrie who won an Oscar for it) being told is the centerpiece of this film. It's all about interrogation and gaming with an unreliable narrator. The main story we see is what's being told to us by Spacey's Verbal Kint, but if you really think about it, none of what he tells us is likely to be even 50% true. We are drawn in, and because it's what we're shown we accept it. Keyser S\u00f6ze's omnipotent ghost  will murder your whole family, and makes murders cower in the boots. Or is he just a fairy tale?

            "content": "The Usual Suspects is pretty much as close to perfect as you can get, in my books. Every actor pulls their weight, every line of the script melts in your mouth, every frame is planned to perfection and every note from those glorious strings in the amazing score will send shivers up your spine.\u00a0\n\nWe begin with a deliciously noir opening scene, bad guys, good guys and a mound of misbegotten mish-mash which apparently has some significance. We then backtrack with Kevin Spacey recounting some sort of criminal escapade and questions begin to become apparent. Who were these men whose actions resulted in the death of a boatful of men? Why were they on the boat in the first place? And above all, who is Keyser Soze?\u00a0\n\nBryan Singer's direction of this brilliant film is something to be admired. Each scene is effortlessly watchable, without sacrificing the character development for an abundance of entertainment. He creates a murky, yet slightly stylized, underworld for his characters and the atmosphere it creates in the film is an intricate blend of deities and scum, where no-one is what they seem and everyone is hiding something.\u00a0\n\nThe actors all pull their weight remarkably. Kevin Spacey, in particular, is amazing as Verbal Kint, 'the man with a plan' and awkward limp to go with it. He effortlessly crosses between motor mouth and his softer moments, displaying a great range in his acting and earning himself an Oscar in the process. Every scene of his is believeable and he easily shines brighter than the rest of the considerable cast.\u00a0\n\nGabriel Byrne is great as Dean Keaton, too, showing the raging madman within him as well as the softer points of a man who everytime he gets out, they pull him back in. His moments with Edie are few and far between, so we don't get to see as much of his range as we could have, but his romance is mostly sidelined in this film.\u00a0\n\nBenicio Del Toro and Stephen Baldwin are great as Finster and McManus (respectively); the unintelligible man and his hyperactive friend, they are a great addition to the cast and extremely likeable. Chazz Palminteri as Agent Dave Kujan is fantastic as well, though the fact that he's acting opposite Spacey most of the time means that he's often overshadowed by Spacey's brilliance, but his delivery of great lines (you get no immunity from me!) means that he holds his own. Kevin Pollack does well as Todd Hockney, \"the man who really didn't give a s**t about anyone.\" He plays the wisecracking professional well, even though his character isn't as memorable as the others.\u00a0\n\nThe script is amazing, giving us some of cinema's greatest phrases and tying together what could have been a very scattered movie. The fact that it can keep such tension sustained for so long is a testament to its brilliance. The dialogue between Agent Kujan and Verbal Kint sparkles with dark humour in its brilliant back and forth.\u00a0\n\nThe score is one of the major components of this film. It is truly brilliant and influenced the world of music in films hugely. The dark strings, reminscent of Jaws, shows the darkness, the intensity, the hint of playfullnes and the danger of the world our characters live in all at once. Guaranteed to stick in your head and change your world.\u00a0\n\nThe Usual Suspects, as I said before, is pretty much as close to perfect as you can get in afilm: a thrilling mystery, great characters, fantastic script and sound and fantastic direction, all set in a film noir style. You're almost guaranteed to like this film, no matter what your predisposition may be in terms of genre or style, you will like this. Fantastic film.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThe almighty line-up scene. Great blend of style, acting and direction with some killer dialogue.",

In my honest opinion, I think this movie is very overrated and I don't think that it deserves a 8.7 on imdb. I will start off with what I liked and what I didn't like that kept this movie from being good in my opinion. Kevin Spacey gave a great performance as Verbal Kint and he was the most interesting character in the whole movie. The twists that the film brings in its final half hour are clever and they brought some intelligence in an otherwise average crime/thriller. The movie had a good score and the cinematography was good as well. Now I start with the movie's flaws. Everything with the story and most of its characters just felt really average and I didn't think there was anything truly special brought to the table. Every actor besides Kevin Spacey I felt never stood out and Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Pollak never brought anything to their characters and they ended up being forgettable in my opinion. The mystery going on wasn't very interesting and the movie didn't do anything to truly hook me in. The pacing got slow at times and I felt the movie was trying to explain too much in so little time. I didn't feel anything for the characters and when push came to shove for them, I just said \" Oh well.\" Bryan Singer made mutants interesting in the X-Men franchise, I don't know why he couldn't do that for me with the characters in this crime/mystery film. Overall, it is not a good feeling to me when I end up feeling differently about a critically acclaimed movie but no matter what, I will always give my honest opinion and I feel that this film has way more credit than it deserves.",

The characters are under introduced and lack substance while the plot is confusing to the audience. When the movie finally starts you feel as if you missed a part of the movie and in that part, the story and characters were introduced. The other major downside to this film is the poor soundtrack choices. The opening scene seems to be confused with if it's introducing a Harry Potter movie or a action crime movie.

            "content": "The greatest trick Kevin Spacey ever pulled was this completely random plot twist which is revered as one of the greatest in cinematic history. This 1995 thriller-crime-drama film is the movie which many claim got Kevin Spacey to where he is now. To some, this film could only be described by the phrase \"cinematic masterpiece.\" The entire movie is told as a flashback of the past six weeks and because of this, the film has an anonymous and ubiquitous narrator. Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (Kevin Spacey) is the only witness of a nearby boat explosion. He begins telling the story about how he met a group of his fellow criminals or parters-in-crime: Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McNanus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro) for the first time. The Usual Suspects keeps its audience on the edge of their seats with its Oscar-worthy performances, vivid cinematography, and impressive editing. \n\tIf casting was an Olympic sport, then the casting director of The Usual Suspects would have most definitely won the gold medal. First of all, Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the greatest talents that Hollywood has seen in the past few decades. His performance in this film is what really sells the entire concept to the viewers. There is a quality to Spacey that mesmerizes the audience into believing his story which turns out to be completely false and improvised by his character. Spacey plays \"a dumb cripple\" as he so eloquently puts it in the film, and therefore gains sympathy and compassion from the audience. He obtains the viewer's loyalty and trust and abruptly betrays it before delivering the epic quote, \"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was \fconvincing the world he didn't exist.\" His performance in this film allocated him his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Other notable cast members include Stephen Baldwin and Golden Globe winner Gabriel Byrne as well as Kevin Pollak and Academy Award winner Benicio Del Toro; all of the aforementioned cast members gave genuine and respectable performances as well. The performances were amazing, but would have been for nothing without the spectacular cinematography.\n\tThe cinematography of The Usual Suspects is outstanding in terms of quality. This film is sometimes classified as a neo noir film which is evident in its dark and ominous atmosphere. Neo noir films are generally dark and twisted with 1940s/1950s vibe and The Usual Suspects delivers much more than a dark atmosphere with a mid 20th century crime drama allusion. The contrast with the lighting aspect of creating this film was obviously very important and well done. Without the complex cinematography, this film would not have had the eerie and mysterious tone/mood that it would have needed. \n\tThe editing of this film is so great that it is easy to forget that this is a movie and not actually happening in real life. Generally, action movies make the editing process difficult, but the editing in this film is expertly and exquisitely done. Cutting together several action sequences is no easy task and editing for a film told in a flashback is probably a very tedious and extensive process. One of the greatest edited sequences in the movie happens towards the end when Agent Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) realizes that Verbal's story is a complete and utter lie. During Kujan's realization, the objects which Verbal used to tell his story are shown with close ups and are edited in with Spacey's voiceover telling the key parts of the story. This is the point in the film where viewers understand that Verbal and Keyser S\u00f6ze are one in the same. \n\tThe Usual Suspects is critically acclaimed and still beloved by many despite the fact that it was released almost 20 years ago. Besides Spacey's additional Oscar, the film also won Best Screenplay. Keyser S\u00f6ze has been recognized as one of the best characters in film history. The Usual Suspects is everything an audience wants in a crime drama film including a killer cast, beautiful cinematography, and expertly executed editing. This film is by every definition a \"cult classic.\"",

However, it was a brilliantly written script, just the puzzle was a little too easy to piece together. This is not to lessen the impact for the average viewer however. I was still relatively rocked and shocked. I'm aware the plot twist was an iconic 180 degree turn that still has people talking to date. It completely altered the story and changed the entire trajectory of the actual film. The fact that the 2 hours we spent watching this was total F.B.S. almost had me writing strongly-worded letters to these filmmakers. So yeah this one didn't hit the bullseye for me, I liked Reservoir Dogs better myself, but I'm sure that's a personal preference. All in all, a good gangster film.",

This crime thriller about a group of small time criminals getting caught up in debt of a mythical gangster named Keyser Soze features one of the most mind bending bait and switches ever pulled off in a film.  If you haven't seen this movie, that reason is enough to watch \"The Usual Suspects\".  This movie was made in the era when everyone was trying to make the next \"Pulp Fiction\", but fortunately this was one of the good ones.  The cast, with the exception of miscast Kevin Pollak, dazzles.  The hard boiled dialogue in this movie is great as well.  This was definitely the movie college kids watched after a night hitting the bar scene in the mid 90's.  Noone I ever talked to about this film told me they guessed the ending.  And if they did they were probably lying to me.  \n\nThis was a breakout film for Benicio Del Toro, even though he isn't in the movie for very long.  He is hilarious.  The movie really belongs to Kevin Spacey.  Although he had been in notable films before, this is what he won an academy award for.  I wonder if the twist was different somehow would the academy still have awarded him?  \n\nThe action in this movie is fast paced, but the movie is not quite tonally perfect.  There are a few scenes in a hospital that seem like they take place in a different movie.  A few of the jobs these guys pull off seem pretty improbable.  And is the twist believable?  Well, at the time I thought it was.  The filmmakers really go for it.  How much you like this movie will in part depend on how plausible it seems to you.  Score: 7.5",

Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite all-time actors, and this is his best all-time performance.  Roughly 90% of this movie is literally Kevin Spacey's character fucking with an overmatched, arrogant cop (played very convincingly by Chazz Palminteri).  The story that is told is brilliant - one that is paced perfectly with cuts back to the present.  It's a story of a myth (or is it?) that is more frightening than the Boogeyman.  The cast is perfect and the dialogue is as sharp as you will find in this type of film.  And, in my opinion, this is the best ending of any movie ever made.  For me, there are literally no holes or complaints from start to finish.  And, the last 10 minutes had my jaw drop the first time I saw it.  Just typing this makes me want to throw it on for like the 100th time.  \n\nGrade = 10/10",

The cast is what makes it though, it's a delightful, colourful selection of scumbags and all the actors play their parts very well and it's nice that some of them are not so well known actors too. Del Toro was one of my favourites and he made me laugh a lot, Kevin Spacey was excellent also. It's a slickly made thrill ride that just gets layer after layer and deeper and deeper and you can't look away until the edge of your seat finale and those final few minutes are really amazing and memorable.

NO COINCIDENCE.\"  \n\n- 'The Usual Suspects' is a 1995 crime-thriller with a pinch of mystery to it by director Bryan Singer (X-men, Trick 'r Treat). I enjoyed the smart film noir storyline that unfolds as a puzzle, due to the flashbacks. The fantastic cast shines in this modern themed whodunit with lots of unexpected twists. Starring Gabriel Byrne (28 Weeks Later), Kevin Spacey (K-PAX), Stephen Baldwin (Born on the Fourth of July), Benicio del Toro (The Wolfman), Kevin Pollak (Hostage), Pete Postlethwaite (Jurassic Park: The Lost World) and Chazz Palminteri (A Bronx Tale). Sit back and try to unravel the mystery surrounding Keyser S\u00f6ze, but keep in mind: nothing is what it seems... \n\nDuring a lineup in the investigation of a truck hijack in New York, five criminals meet. Dean Keaton (Byrne) a corrupt policeman who claims to have given up his criminal activity, Todd Hockey (Pollak) who is a hijacker, thief Michael McManus (Baldwin) and his partner-in-crime Fred Fenster (del Toro), and the limping con artist Verbal Kint (Spacey). While they are in holding, McManus convinces them to join forces in committing a robbery. When all has worked out successfully, the men are approached by a lawyer named Kobayashi (Postlethwaite). He works for the mysterious Keyser S\u00f6ze, a man surrounded by many myths. It becomes clear that they all stole or did something to S\u00f6ze in the past. To get even, he wants them to destroy 91 million worth of drugs belonging to his rival, that's arriving on a boat. The mission goes horribly wrong when the boat explodes and 27 people end up dead. Now, it's up to special agent Dave Kujan (Palminteri) to find Keyser S\u00f6ze.",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n*Best film of the Week Award*\n\nI've actually watched this film multiple times, but I rewatched it just to make sure it was good, and look out.  It's good.  The Usual Suspects was my first Bryan Singer film and had been a childhood favorite of mine for a while.  I've loved a lot of great things in this film.  The acting, directing, story, characters, and dialogue were all phenomenal.  The film starts off slowly, giving a rather simple plot at first.  Then, many twists and turns are thrown your way and it's one hell of a ride to watch.  This entire week I've watched 8 other movies: Re-Animator (7/10), Breakfast Club (5/10), Arachnophobia rewatch (8/10), There Will Be Blood rewatch (6/10), and the next couple are not worthy of a mention, due  to their value being extremely low.  However, the Usual Suspects earns the best film of the week award, and it wasn't a close finish.  It blew the other films away.\n\nThe Usual Suspects starts off really simple.  After a truck has been hijacked and stolen, the police officers capture 5 very high profile criminals: Fenster (played by Benicio del Toro), McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), Hockney (Pete P.), and Keaton (played by Gabriel Bryne).  Now, they are all very suspicious as to why they were all put in one lineup because you never put 5 very good criminals in the same lineup.  They soon find out that it is a setup, and are put there for one reason, which I won't specify.  However, they are all there because one man wants them to be there; Keyser Soze.  Keyser Soze is a myth, an urban legend, who is rarely seen.  He brings the group together, so that they can take out a huge stash of coke that a rival, Hungarian gang is selling to the Argentinians.  Of course....there is more to this plot than meets the eye, and when it comes full circle, you'll be amazed.\n\nThe best part of the Usual Suspects is the dialogue.  It's snappy, quick, and very witty at times.  The actors speak a mile a minute, so you better be paying close attention to what they say or you'll be forced to rewind the scene to get the dialogue right.  While this may not bode well with many people, this actually gives the film a huge advantage for me.  There is a lot of things to be said in this film and if they spoke at a mild pace, it would really slow the film down.  Also, there are moments of pure wit and hilarity.  When I had to rewind a scene because I missed one important line, I found a couple of funny one-liners tossed in, such as when McManus broke the fourth wall.  It's fun to know that there are some lines you'll miss, so you test yourself to see if you got it.  Many casual moviegoers will be scratching their heads trying to make sense, that is if they have slow hearing.  However, most people shouldn't really have a problem.\n\nAnother wonderful thing is the style and acting.  It's a very slickly made film, featuring Singer's typical flare that he adds to all his films.  The camera pans are stylistic and some shots are purely magical.  I love when a film can combine both style and substance into one amazing concoction of epic proportions, and this film is one of those films.  Unlike *cough*Drive*cough*, it has enough narrative smarts and more than 1 line of dialogue per scene.  And unlike Bullhead (fight me, Belgians), it has enough style to keep the film fresh and unique.  However, where the film is nearly at it's best is the acting.  All of the actors gave well rounded performances.  Gabriel Bryne as Keaton is a mix of anger and self loathing.  Benicio Del Toro has great comedic moments in his scenes, though he was more of a background character.  Stephen Baldwin gave a good performance as well.  However, the one man that stole the show....was none other than John Doe: Kevin Spacey.  I've always known Spacey was a great actor, but here, it's like on a different level.  Sure, his John Doe performance in Se7en was great.  One of the best.  However, I completely found myself more interested in Verbal Kint.  A truly unique character, with some great acting, can end up being the best thing ever.\n\nOverall, to keep it short.  The Usual Suspects is one of my favorite films ever.  It's fast paced, fun, and filled to the brim with great dialogue.  The acting is phenomenal from all, especially Kevin Spacey.  The dialogue is spoken a little too fast at times.  And I did predict the ending, though I doubted it a couple of times.  And Benicio del Toro should've had a bigger part in it.  However, those flaws are easily outmatched by this simple, yet cunning film.  Crafted by a good director in Springer, coupled with an excellent script, this is a prime example of what crime dramas should be about.  Have a good amount of substance and tension, while throwing in some style, and you will have yourselves another classic.\n\n9/10",

            "content": "It's unfortunate that years before I finally saw this movie last night, even though I've had it on DVD for a while now as well, I already knew who Keyser Soze was.  So, easily, the most important part of the film was spoiled to me.  And I can pretty much guarantee that knowing who Keyser was heavily affected the score I ended up giving the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I still think the movie is absolutely incredible, but going in blind is definitely the best way to go if you want the reveal to have the most impact possible.  Having said that, knowing what happened, opened my eyes into viewing the film in a completely different manner.  Because of that, I focused on the way the film reaches the conclusion of who Keyser Soze really is and what his plan was, rather than on the fact that I already knew who it was.  And I must say that the way the film gets to its climax is absolutely masterful.  A tip of the hat to the screenwriter, Christopher McQuarrie, the editors and Bryan Singer for crafting such an intriguing and compelling film.  This is a film that starts off with a very simple concept, 5 criminals come together to pull a series of heists, they're contacted by Keyser Soze's lawyer, Mr. Kobayashi, as all 5 of the criminals have, unknowingly, stolen from Mr. Soze.  Keyser provides the 5 men with a chance to repay their debt if they do one last job for him.  This is where the movie really gets going, because there's film throws on so many layers of betrayal and deceit that you know that you pretty much can't trust anybody in this film.  The film, since it's handled so expertly, isn't that hard to follow at all considering how much is actually going on story-wise.  There's so much information that the film wants to get out that it's very surprising, in a good way, to see that the film doesn't become confusing or hard to follow.  That's also a credit to the editing of the film.  Of course the biggest, and most important, part of the film centers around the mystery of who is Keyser Soze.  I'll try my hardest not to spoil the film, as that'll take out some of the fun out of it, but the handling of this character was absolute genius.  It's really hard to distinguish what's real and what's fake about Keyser.  Perhaps he wasn't even as bad as some people believed he was, it's just that the the stories involving him kept getting more and more exaggerated.  It seems, to me, that his reputation preceded him.  Maybe he even spread these lies around in order to make sure that no one fucked with him.  I believe there's a hint of truth to Keyser's backstory.  Not all of it, but some of it.  Everything else was spread around in order to create fear among his enemies.  Of course, that's all a theory in my mind.  Because if it was true, why would the Hungarians and the Argentinians have that deal that the 5 criminals were sent to break up.  And the way that Keyser manipulates every little thing, no matter how small, and person in order to get what he wants was, again, a stroke of genius.  Everything goes pretty much exactly as Keyser intended and it's an absolutely joy to watch.  That's part of the reason I enjoyed the film so much.  The fact that I knew who Keyser Soze was, it led me to pay attentions to the smaller details and seeing how everybody was pretty much manipulated by this man.  It'd be embarrassing if it was real.  The acting is strong, and Kevin Spacey absolutely kills it here.  I think that's about all I'm going to say on the acting because it, again, might spoil the film for some and I don't want that.  Even if the film is almost 20 years old, I don't want to anybody who might be seeing it for the first time.  With that said, I absolutely this movie for completely different reasons than I would've had it not been spoiled for me.  It's still an incredible film.  Don't be fooled by the fact that it starts off like a simple heist film.  Trust me when I say it's anything but a typical heist film.  There's twists and turns that'd make M. Night Shyamalan shit in his pants.",

            "content": "The Usual Suspects was an odd surprise for me to see in some people's top 10 lists or be regarded as one of the best crime films in the 90s as I personally felt that this was a let down.\n\nThe film was written by Christopher McQuarrie, who as of now has a small filmography and is usually in collaboration with director, Bryan Singer. What McQuarrie has written here is a crime drama that also takes in some elements of the supernatural, but it is only used as a symbol or metaphor of sorts rather than an actual supernatural being. I personally did not like the first half of the film, as it just threw us in with these characters and never gives an opportunity to introduce us to them. I ended up not caring about the problems that they were facing because I never had this sort of connection or at the very least an understanding of their existence in this story. We only really see the inner layers of two characters throughout the entire film and it kind of ruins the suspense and mystery, as it makes it easier for us to predict who the suspect is. I don't care if the film's running time extends for an extra 30 minutes, all five characters should be evenly fleshed out (or at least close to it). Another problem that I had with McQuarrie's writing is the dialogue. A lot of the times, it feels so campy and been overly used in many similar films before it. McQuarrie wasn't able to create a higher variety of personalities for his characters, that they all feel the same. The only character that he gave great dialogue to was to Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey). It seems that he was too preoccupied with writing great characters like Dean Keaton and Roger Kint, that he forgot to make the others just as equally interesting. I also found the fable of Keyser Soze to be a bit underwhelming, as I expected more from such a legendary figure. Maybe if the tale also related itself to the crime world that these characters are in, then that way I could at least see the connection right from the start on how his reputation in the crime world was so established. What I did like about his screenplay was the latter part of the film, starting at the introduction of Kobayashi, as this is the point where our characters are in real danger and it got me curious on how they can get out of this situation. This is where the mystery starts to begin, as this is where everything builds up to the climax of the film. The first half never really contributed that much to the film's payoff. The film's climax is the main reason why I come back to see this film, as it's so well written. It contains twists that I didn't see coming and it allowed me to be more appreciative of the performances of some actors during subsequent viewings. Though the ending doesn't give you a full conclusion or truth on the incident, instead it gives you something much more, an interesting story filled with half truths or in other terms, gossip. How do things spread, it's due to gossip or word of mouth and through this, hype is built. Sometimes the truth is so underwhelming and that it was better before when it was just full of crap. I think McQuarrie knew this, which is why he never gave a hint of a real conclusion for any of these characters.\n\nThe film was directed by Bryan Singer and this would be his second feature film. Singer understood that the film would be at it's most effective if it creates it as a mystery with a surprise at the end rather than have an orthodox crime film. Through this approach, Singer has definitely made something that stood out above the rest, regardless of how I feel about the film as a whole. He makes the most out of McQuarrie's screenplay and tried to build us much tension of it as he could, thought at some cases he fails. This failure is more due to the lack of depth in the script, but when the script gets going, Singer shows what he could do. Singer is more of a mainstream director and he isn't at all pretentious with his work, so the film overall is just a take it or leave it experience. I feel that this approach will truly work if you bring something unique to the experience, examples of this include Reservoir Dogs and Memento; unique yet accessible. Due to the half of the film is disappointing in the writing department, it felt quite slow. It desperately needed something to jump start me in order to keep myself engaged, which did arrive but not until halfway through. Singer does start it off with a murder that did made me curious, but that scene doesn't become relevant until much later.\n\nThe film's director of cinematography was Newton Thomas Sigel, who is also known to collaborate with Singer. Sigel doesn't really bring anything interesting here, as there really isn't much room to bring any sense of depth and/or style. He just shoots what he needs in order for the audience to keep up with the narrative. The shots that Singer and Sigel have chosen usually consists of these slow zooms and tracking shots to kind of give us an idea that we are getting closer and closer to something big. As the action set pieces don't sell the film as such, there was a huge emphasis on facial shots and have Singer cut to each character in order to give us their reaction to a situation, and it does kind of give more to these characters than what is actually written for them. The construction of the shots during the climax and the way Singer and his editor assemble it, is the main core of what makes the audience feel surprised. I commend Singer for this, as if this failed then the entire film would have been a disaster and it's effect on the audience wouldn't be thought of so highly today.\n\nJohn Ottman is the film's composer and his work here was really a let down. I can definitely see that it is a great score but it feels out of place for a film like this, as it never created any effect of suspense or tension for me. It just felt like it was there for the sake of being there. Take another crime film from that period, Se7en. That film's score was so well crafted in creating this dark and gritty mood. The Usual Suspects doesn't have to go that route, as it is a much more lighter film, but it could have been the same in the way the score was able to get reactions from us and creating tension.\n\nThe film has a decent line up of actors playing the 5 main characters, though some did kind of disappoint me as they reached to a point of annoyance. Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton was actually great to watch. Byrne character was quite focused on the film, so Byrne had a lot to work with. In this film, Byrne was able to give depth that the character needed in order to for his character to be sympathised. There always seems to be something behind his face, as if there is something that he isn't showing us. Keaton is the only one where we see a bit of his backstory and relationships. Stephen Baldwin as McManus was decent, though there wasn't really a lot for him to do. Baldwin plays him as a hothead who doesn't hates being antagonised. At times he does bring energy to the scene, but it is only brief. Kevin Pollak plays as Hockney, who for the most part is dull. This is due to both the writing and the acting. There is just nothing to this character except for a couple of lines and an extra person for the boat scene near the end. Chazz Palminetri as Dave Kujan, the officer/detective that interrogates Kevin Spacey, was good for the most part. He does bring this intensity and attitude to the role, which suits him and the character he is playing. When he delivers his lines, it shows how immersed he is with the role. The main issue with him though is the lines that he has to say, it's not in his execution but in the writing. There are moments where he just comes off as stereotypical and it does kind of draws a bit of attention to itself. Benicio Del Toro was irritating to watch. I have seen him in better performances and what he brings here is just over the top and weird. Why does he need that almost non-understandable accent? Sometimes less is more. Kevin Spacey was quite mesmerizing as Roger Kint, as he was convincing as the character all the way through; he did come off as a vulnerable man, which was important in order to sell the character. I can't say this was his best role, as personally I thought of him more highly in American Beauty and Se7en.\n\nThis film had potential but it just couldn't reach it, due to the problems in it's script and actors.",

However the film did win two Academy Awards, Best Supporting Actor (Kevin Spacey) and Best Original Screenplay (Christopher McQuarrie). Since it's release in 1995 many people fell in love with The Usual Suspects, including myself. I recently saw The Usual Suspects for the first time and I must say that I was blown away by this film, I think this movie is truly brilliant and in a genre of it's own making it a very unique film. Everything in this film was just amazing, especially the script that was written by Christopher McQuarrie. McQuarrie deserved the win at the Oscars because his writing for this film was just incredible. One thing he did that blew me away is the fact that he put so many different genres into one film; I mean there's comedy, action, drama, mystery, and a little bit of a thriller all in one movie and it works perfectly. The story for this film was just fabulous and they way it was told was amazing. This film has one big twist that I thought worked perfectly, personally I sort of saw it coming but when it was revealed I was still shocked if that makes any sense. One thing I love about this movie is that there is not one dull moment to me, I was entertained the whole entire run time. I can't talk about The Usual Suspects without mentioning the dialogue, the dialogue is just astonishing and it's so good that it doesn't even feel like your watching a movie. I also loved how witty the dialogue was, every joke in this movie hit the right note for me. Bryan Singer directed this movie and this is the film that put him on the map because he did such a fascinating job directing this film. I thought his style was perfect for the film and that his vision for everything was magnificent. He also did such an incredible job at directing this huge group of talented actors and managed to get them all to give the best performances they possible could; that brings me to the acting. The acting in this film was just wonderful, each character was magnificently written and had enough background for you to care about them and each actor portrayed there character perfectly. Every actor gives a knockout performance in this movie and that includes Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Pollak, and many others, there are just so many people in this movie to name. Another thing worth mentioning is the John Ottoman's excellent score which fit the film perfectly. In the end The Usual Suspects became on of my favorites and is a film that I encourage you to see.",

The first 30 minutes is boring, but the rest is good. Kevin Spacey is the best actor here playing a cripple with utter conviction. My favourite scene in this film is when Verbal Kint tells the myth about Keyser Soza,which is a great scene. The appearance of Soza was better and more scary in this myth. The only problem with this film is that it is predictable and I could easily guess what the suspense would be because there are only too few people to suspect in this film.",

            "content": "The Usual Suspects was an odd surprise for me to see in some people's top 10 lists or be regarded as one of the best crime films in the 90s as I personally felt that this was a let down.\n\nThe film was written by Christopher McQuarrie, who as of now has a small filmography and is usually in collaboration with director, Bryan Singer. What McQuarrie has written here is a crime drama that also takes in some elements of the supernatural, but it is only used as a symbol or metaphor of sorts rather than an actual supernatural being. I personally did not like the first half of the film, as it just threw us in with these characters and never gives an opportunity to introduce us to them. I ended up not caring about the problems that they were facing because I never had this sort of connection or at the very least an understanding of their existence in this story. We only really see the inner layers of two characters throughout the entire film and it kind of ruins the suspense and mystery, as it makes it easier for us to predict who the suspect is. I don't care if the film's running time extends for an extra 30 minutes, all five characters should be evenly fleshed out (or at least close to it). Another problem that I had with McQuarrie's writing is the dialogue. A lot of the times, it feels so campy and been overly used in many similar films before it. McQuarrie wasn't able to create a higher variety of personalities for his characters, that they all feel the same. The only character that he gave great dialogue to was to Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey). It seems that he was too preoccupied with writing great characters like Dean Keaton and Roger Kint, that he forgot to make the others just as equally interesting. I also found the fable of Keyser Soze to be a bit underwhelming, as I expected more from such a legendary figure. Maybe if the tale also related itself to the crime world that these characters are in, then that way I could at least see the connection right from the start on how his reputation in the crime world was so established. What I did like about his screenplay was the latter part of the film, starting at the introduction of Kobayashi, as this is the point where our characters are in real danger and it got me curious on how they can get out of this situation. This is where the mystery starts to begin, as this is where everything builds up to the climax of the film. The first half never really contributed that much to the film's payoff. The film's climax is the main reason why I come back to see this film, as it's so well written. It contains twists that I didn't see coming and it allowed me to be more appreciative of the performances of some actors during subsequent viewings. Though the ending doesn't give you a full conclusion or truth on the incident, instead it gives you something much more, an interesting story filled with half truths or in other terms, gossip. How do things spread, it's due to gossip or word of mouth and through this, hype is built. Sometimes the truth is so underwhelming and that it was better before when it was just full of crap. I think McQuarrie knew this, which is why he never gave a hint of a real conclusion for any of these characters.\n\nThe film was directed by Bryan Singer and this would be his second feature film. Singer understood that the film would be at it's most effective if it creates it as a mystery with a surprise at the end rather than have an orthodox crime film. Through this approach, Singer has definitely made something that stood out above the rest, regardless of how I feel about the film as a whole. He makes the most out of McQuarrie's screenplay and tried to build us much tension of it as he could, thought at some cases he fails. This failure is more due to the lack of depth in the script, but when the script gets going, Singer shows what he could do. Singer is more of a mainstream director and he isn't at all pretentious with his work, so the film overall is just a take it or leave it experience. I feel that this approach will truly work if you bring something unique to the experience, examples of this include Reservoir Dogs and Memento; unique yet accessible. Due to the half of the film is disappointing in the writing department, it felt quite slow. It desperately needed something to jump start me in order to keep myself engaged, which did arrive but not until halfway through. Singer does start it off with a murder that did made me curious, but that scene doesn't become relevant until much later.\n\nThe film's director of cinematography was Newton Thomas Sigel, who is also known to collaborate with Singer. Sigel doesn't really bring anything interesting here, as there really isn't much room to bring any sense of depth and/or style. He just shoots what he needs in order for the audience to keep up with the narrative. The shots that Singer and Sigel have chosen usually consists of these slow zooms and tracking shots to kind of give us an idea that we are getting closer and closer to something big. As the action set pieces don't sell the film as such, there was a huge emphasis on facial shots and have Singer cut to each character in order to give us their reaction to a situation, and it does kind of give more to these characters than what is actually written for them. The construction of the shots during the climax and the way Singer and his editor assemble it, is the main core of what makes the audience feel surprised. I commend Singer for this, as if this failed then the entire film would have been a disaster and it's effect on the audience wouldn't be thought of so highly today.\n\nJohn Ottman is the film's composer and his work here was really a let down. I can definitely see that it is a great score but it feels out of place for a film like this, as it never created any effect of suspense or tension for me. It just felt like it was there for the sake of being there. Take another crime film from that period, Se7en. That film's score was so well crafted in creating this dark and gritty mood. The Usual Suspects doesn't have to go that route, as it is a much more lighter film, but it could have been the same in the way the score was able to get reactions from us and creating tension.\n\nThe film has a decent line up of actors playing the 5 main characters, though some did kind of disappoint me as they reached to a point of annoyance. Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton was actually great to watch. Byrne character was quite focused on the film, so Byrne had a lot to work with. In this film, Byrne was able to give depth that the character needed in order to for his character to be sympathised. There always seems to be something behind his face, as if there is something that he isn't showing us. Keaton is the only one where we see a bit of his backstory and relationships. Stephen Baldwin as McManus was decent, though there wasn't really a lot for him to do. Baldwin plays him as a hothead who doesn't hates being antagonised. At times he does bring energy to the scene, but it is only brief. Kevin Pollak plays as Hockney, who for the most part is dull. This is due to both the writing and the acting. There is just nothing to this character except for a couple of lines and an extra person for the boat scene near the end. Chazz Palminetri as Dave Kujan, the officer/detective that interrogates Kevin Spacey, was good for the most part. He does bring this intensity and attitude to the role, which suits him and the character he is playing. When he delivers his lines, it shows how immersed he is with the role. The main issue with him though is the lines that he has to say, it's not in his execution but in the writing. There are moments where he just comes off as stereotypical and it does kind of draws a bit of attention to itself. Benicio Del Toro was irritating to watch. I have seen him in better performances and what he brings here is just over the top and weird. Why does he need that almost non-understandable accent? Sometimes less is more. Kevin Spacey was quite mesmerizing as Roger Kint, as he was convincing as the character all the way through; he did come off as a vulnerable man, which was important in order to sell the character. I can't say this was his best role, as personally I thought of him more highly in American Beauty and Se7en.\n\nThis film had potential but it just couldn't reach it, due to the problems in it's script and actors.",

This anachronism of the storytelling through Verbal Kint's perspective emphasized the confusion of the story in its entirety, which I thought was really cool. I have to somewhat agree with the majority that this is one of the coolest movie endings I have ever seen. It's surprising, and at the same time, it completes the full circle of thematic brought up in the movie. I think the movie isn't convoluted enough to the point where it's too confusing, like Memento, but I think the absence of a linear structure made the telling of the story much more suspenseful and entertaining. I really enjoyed this movie. Go watch it now.",

The Usual Suspects strings together a group of interesting characters in an interluded storyline that is fascinating and unexpected. Even though my initial estimation was correct, it was not without a series of doubt, surprise and ultimately conviction to find out about the unexpected. Visually, the film is also extremely stylish. The combination of a solid story with interesting, rememberable characters guarantees The Usual Suspects a place in film history and worthy of repeated viewings. Just as the film title suggest, the group of characters would be considered the \"usual\" in most circumstances, but in this case they are anything but \"usual\", just like the film itself, The Usual Suspects is anything but a usual crime thriller.",

It's an amazing designed crime thriller, comparable in quality to another movie Spacey stars in, released the same year,Se7en. After the first twenty minutes it was never easy to follow, this made it all the more intriguing. Like the large majority of people I strongly preferred the second half. Most notably the concluding ten minutes, which messed with your heart and mind. I only fully grasped the final twist the following morning. It was grade A quality. Spacey best performance by far, he deserved his Oscar. The story was pure genius, and while it dragged in some parts, I really can't say I was ever bored.",

The five thieving and scheming protagonists are all colorful and lively; the dialogue is sharp and even hilarious at times; and the writing is intelligent. Even the soundtrack and editing deserve special mentioning for their ability to stand out from the forgettable fare we usually hear and see. If for nothing else, watch it for Kevin Spacey's performance.",

            "content": "A movie whose name is gotten from a line in the old classic, Casablanca \u00e2The Usual Suspect\u00e2 is about an interrogation gone wrong. The movie is very hard to connect together, and the masterful twist ending for some did more harm than good, but for me it was the thriller of the whole movie. The fact that after the movie is over I still have to sit down and think about it, connecting the dots and wanting to have another re-run of the movie to be sure that I don\u00e2(TM)t miss any dot, that is the reason why this movie is a master piece.\n\nWritten by Christopher McQuarrie, the Keyser S\u00c3\u00b6ze character is based on the accounts of John List, an accountant who murdered his family in 1971 and then disappeared for almost 20 years by assuming a new identity before he was eventually apprehended in 1989. McQuarrie got the name Keyser S\u00c3\u00b6ze from the name of his former supervisor Keyser Sume, and the last name S\u00c3\u00b6ze is Turkish which is translated as \"talk too much.\"\n\nThe Interrogation scene was first shot and it ran for 6 days, and the rest of the movie was put together next and editing was the grand touch that made this mystery thriller that good a movie to see.\n\nThe movie plot is about the interrogation of a small time con man named Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), who is a one of the only two survivors of a heist gone wrong that resulted to a fire on a ship. He tells the interrogator the series of events that led him and four other criminals to the boat.\n\nThis series of events are shown to the viewer in the form of flashbacks as Kint narrates his story to the over confident interrogator. As the story goes on and gets complex the interrogator connects the dots and explains the story better to Kint, only to get the shocker of his life when he releases Kint believing he was used by the other four.\n\nDone with a 6 million dollar production budget, the movie recouped its production cost and more; the well crafted screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie gained him an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Kevin Spacey won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the criminal Keyser S\u00c3\u00b6ze.\n\nThe Usual suspect is a fine film, well developed to push the imaginations of the viewer, the unexpected ending is the cream on the top of this delicious masterpiece and one thing is sure, you will be asking for seconds after you are done seeing it the first time.  \n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",
