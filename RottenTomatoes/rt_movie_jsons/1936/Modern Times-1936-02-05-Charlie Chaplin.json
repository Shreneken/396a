It works fantastically, and you can't do anything else than laugh. From the moment being sucked up through enormous grinding wheels, to the moment of testing a new food machine while working. This magic touch of Charlie Chaplin, is one many will remember in his films and stories, and will even make future generations still laugh. A must see cult classic.",

He then meets a young, homeless girl, who is recently orphaned, and tries to build a home with her.\n\nSo first of all, there is no denying that Charlie Chaplin is one of the most charasmatic actors ever put on screen, he just steals every scene with perfect comedic timing and movement. Modern Times will be the type of movie, that will always stand the test of time, not only is the story still relevant today, but the movie feels pretty modern for its time:} I was really impressed by how much I enjoyed the movie, even when there was almost no sound for most the time of course. Modern Times has a lot of heart, the performances, the locations and everything else is done to almost perfection, Modern Times is a timeless classic, that will be watched and studied in hunderds more years!",

            "content": "From the roaring 20s into the depressing 30s, an unimaginable reality for some with both historical and personal stories passed through generations so the era can be learnt and avoided, mirrored through the cinema that affected the performers majored in its silent beginning till evolution struck for stories to be vocally heard. While we look back at the transition between the two contrasting decades, the cinema receives appreciation over those expressive talents upon reflection and visit rediscovery. Charlie Chaplin is an iconic expression, and he captured those inner thoughts well in one of his prolific classics. \"Modern Times\", Chaplin's last [\"hurrah\"] as the Tramp with vocal introduction, is a satire with thought as he still finds purity just as much as bringing hilarity, albeit not memorably as much.\n\nIn another one of his adventures he clumsily builds up within a cityscape, during an industrial revolution, the Tramp gets over-pressured as a factory worker with the inescapable machinery overwhelming him. The chaotic pattern continues after mishaps after mishaps as he wanders and searches only to be in the wrong place at the wrong time that landed him behind bars multiple times, which he finds pressure he actually prefers. One of his stints introduced him to an orphan girl, who recently lost her father and separated from her little sisters. Together, and no matter whether apart, they face life's struggling difficulties with optimistic solutions just around the stretchy corners.\n\nConsidering the film's setting, the comedic storytelling unexpectedly contributes and timely reflected, in which providing a perfect stage for the Tramp to lastly bow before hanging up his cap and cane (then shave off the fake mustache). He walks as an everyman character, and whenever he emotionally spikes through his expressive performance, Chaplin enables relation to the character, as well \"speaks\" the truth indirectly. In connection to the great depression, he sympathizes with the overbearing work conditions experienced by factory workers at daily extents before expressing the inner emotions nobody wanted to admit but possibly agree in silent reluctance. Chaplin, who brought this picture with full command in every prominence, checked things off the list between satirical targets and thematic occurrences to visually address whilst inadvertently structuring a time capsule; all while decidedly keeping the medium as silent with decisive experimentation.\n\nHis co-star Paulette Goddard is the heroine of the story who brings charm and realized gravitas, while Chaplin just performed his usual antics with ever-effective chaotic patterns. Goddard's performance brings weight to satire as her character, written as a gamin, experienced more loss that truly leans towards one of the period's devastating effects. She represents one's affected case as sympathetic resonance gets defined as hope, which remains uncertain at the end with nothing further checked besides showing how she brings equal purified chemistry with determination and personal rebellion alongside the Tramp. She gave a vivid performance that silently speaks louder than just general simplistic proclamations outside expressive actions, whereas she gets empathetically understood.\n\nCharlie Chaplin unveiled a twofold communication like a poet delivering a meaningfully polished statement as a reaction to the changing times. The symbolic conclusion verified that notion as he'd written the script and coordinated what to exclaim on title cards, particularly the last one stemmed towards the faded silent era, as it looks like he's speaking to his love interest who more represents the struggling public, but he's connected to the film industry's silent performers and offered reassurance to the uncertain future. \"Modern Times\" may not be as high as the other classics but is quite impactful as well masterful while functions as a time capsule with a definitive connection mirrored between the evolving cinema and the modernization pressuring the times towards the economic decline.\n\nIt's recommendable for those who've seen his previous films as an iconic sample of the silent era transitioning, with hesitated embrace, into the talkies. Independently and individually as its own, it's an enjoyable comedy that refreshes Chaplin's screened talents as he said farewell to his funny character. Same goes to the spectatorship when the film released as it refreshes the entertainment value in reconnecting with the Tramp before saying goodbye, but it doesn't mean we can't revisit his past works that validates his timelessness and how he connects while generating laughter.

Modern Times is the story of of the Tramp (Chaplin) and an orphan girl (Paulette Goddard) trying to get by in modern life. The film is honestly humorous as it pokes fun at the social issues that plagued the United States of America at the time in a pretty clever way. The visual effects in the film were fantastic  especially with the giant machine and the edge when the Tramp is roller-skating. Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard both gave incredible performances in the film as the two showed wonderful chemistry. The direction by Chaplin was wonderful as well. A comical clapstick comedy that satirizes modernity, Modern Times is a fantastic and amusing film.",

Se trata de una de las películas más influyentes de la historia; cuando tu miras esta cinta no solo te vas a reír, también vas a ser testigo de como ha cambiado el cine y como ha evolucionado la comedia a través de los años. Se trata de una obra muy personal de Chaplin, si sabes algo acerca de su biografía, notarás algunas similitudes con la historia. Los personajes, son entrañables, cómicos y simpáticos. No se puede esperar menos de la historia en general, es reflexiva, romántica, satírica y por demás realista; perfecta para apagar el cerebro y solo disfrutar de los fotogramas. Queda claro que es todo un monumento cinematográfico, un clásico; al verla, puede parecerte familiar, porque un gran número de sus escenas han sido recreadas y referenciadas en la cultura popular una y otra vez, y esto no es muy difícil notarlo. Tampoco cabe duda que es necesario verla como un espectador de los años 20, pues a los ojos de hoy en día, puede parecer poco innovadora y predecible, pero es todo lo contrario, solo hay que verla con un punto de vista diferente, pues se trata de una película de más de ochenta años, pero que aún así sigue conservando su vigencia y magia, continúa siendo entretenida y es de esas obras maestras que todos deben ver al menos una vez en la vida. \nNota: 9/10.",

            "content": "All workers are gears in the big industrial machine and Chaplin's just the funniest cog.\n\nDirector Charlie Chaplin's romantic comedy and industrial satire Modern Times (1936) both says farewell to his beloved Tramp character and spoofs America's capitalist system that leaves people broke and hungry or overworked in cruel factory jobs. Chaplin's writing is really creative and biting as the cruel bosses constantly berate and blame their workers, while paying them little and giving them short breaks if any. You absolutely feel the frustration, tiredness, and desperation of the working class that Chaplin beautifully portrays and sympathizes with in every scene.\n\nChaplin's direction is a blast of innovative shots and visual gags. From Chaplin twisting nuts and bolts to riding the conveyor belt in the factory into the machine. Chaplin is so effortlessly funny with his pantomime, dancing, singing, and dramatic skills. Paulette Goddard is lovely and very funny alongside Chaplin as The Tramp's love interest. It's quite nice that Chaplin gave his Tramp a bittersweet ending. Chaplin even produced Modern Times. Editors Charlie Chaplin and Willard Nico cut quickly around all the comedy bits to keep up a frantic pace for 87 minutes.\n\nRoland Totheroh, Ira H. Morgan, and Bud Thackery's cinematography is really neat as the camera perspectives shift super fast. Charles D. Hall creates a hilarious complex machine for the machine. I really like J. Russell Spencer's art direction with The Tramp in all these wide open spaces against the chaos of worker strikes and police fights.\n\nComposer Charlie Chaplin's score is really beautiful and matches Modern Times' touching tone. Frank Maher's sound design is great for the machine's moving parts and singing mix. In short, Modern Times is a masterpiece that combines Chaplin's brilliant mind for satire with hilarious slapstick comedy and tender romance.",

In its 'episodic' format (with the Tramp and his partner the Gamine placed in a wide variety of situations throughout the film) Modern Times is also a throwback to the self contained plots of Chaplin's early two-reelers, which in turn proved to be so influential on the way that Disney and other animators would format their own comic shorts.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writer's most easily recognizable incarnation: The Tramp. Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film. Indeed, several iconographic studies have labeled The Tramp (with his worn hat, distinctive mustache, dusty suit, cane, and trademark waddle) as the single most identifiable fictional image in history.\n\nStill, the film that perhaps most influenced the creation and thematic realization of Modern Times was not even a silent one. The Jazz Singer, which debuted in 1927, five years before Modern Times began production, is perhaps the most important watershed film in the industry's century-old history. In the film, comic great Al Jolson stands up in front of the audience and...sings. And as Millard Mitchell said in Singin' in the Rain, the public was suddenly in a frenzy for \"Talking pictures! Talking pictures!\" Sadly, with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue, the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable. Nevertheless, Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights (1931), which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made, but by the time Modern Times was released, Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying art.\n\nModern Times is not an entirely silent film, (there are dialogue snippets and sound effects), but if you look closely, every character with dialogue (excluding Chaplin himself) is being mocked. Even when The Tramp opens his mouth (the only time he ever did so in a film), the words are nonsensical, defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance, entertainment, and quality.\n\nDespite the film's status as one of the greatest comedies of all-time, it is hard to ignore the political component. In his movies, Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress, as often embodied through the social elite, the police, and wealthy entrepreneurs. The irony of the film's title, then, is two-fold. It connects with Chaplin's own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form, but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression (long working hours with little job security and meager salary, while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time) The world was changing fast, and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficial.\n\nAs we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern, mechanized world, we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results, but we can also feel pain and pity. He is clearly a man who does not belong. Indeed, The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world (notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind, and as far as we know, he has no friends, family, funds, or history).\n\nHe takes on assembly lines, feeding machines, department stores, policemen and various other mass-oriented aspects of the industrialized world (all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity), but The Tramp (and his symbolic extension, the individual) never seem to fit.\n\nThis is, consequently, why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film. The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young, homeless woman who is referred to as \"The Gamin\" and is played by Chaplin's then-wife, Paulette Goddard. These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward, despite adversity. Both are nameless, neither has a home, and they each have no money or material possessions.\n\nIt is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living. The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism, yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain. The conclusion of the film, which most likely reflects upon Chaplin's own emotions, is tinged with sadness, but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years ago.\n\nThen there is, of course, the comedy, which is the stuff of legendary status. Some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in Modern Times. These include The Tramp's bout with an assembly line (and his resulting twitches), his unfortunate encounter with \"nose-powder\", the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry, and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customer.\n\nIn my opinion, however, the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates (the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film) and the sequence where The Tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an out-of-control feeding machine (the most uproarious moment in the film).\n\nThese are just a handful of moments that make Modern Times the enduring masterpiece that it is. On a personal level, the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us. In our hearts, many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which The Tramp and The Gamin live life (with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappings).\n\nAs Chaplin so skillfully shows, however, our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream, lost among the sheep-like herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only Fritz Lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity. Still, the final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an ever-changing world.",

It felt like the least funny and least substantial of the 3 films, with a scattershot plot and sporadic social commentary. This might have been intentional, as this was to be The Tramp's final cinematic outing, and Chaplin wanted him to go out doing what he had become famous for. It does end on an organically positive note, and if Chaplin's style of comedy appeals to you, then Modern Times should be on your watchlist. But I wasn't won over by its message or its content.",

Siendo esta cinta una de las pocas en las que se puede escuchar claramente la voz del actor, constituyendo así, una mezcla muy entretenida entre el cine mudo y el cine sonoro.\nLa película tiene como protagonistas principales a Charles Chaplin, quien interpreta el personaje de un explotado trabajador industrial, y a Paulette Goddard, que hace el papel de una chica huérfana, con la que Chaplin se encontrará y pasaran ciertas aventuras juntos. Sin embargo, tendrán que enfrentarse ante una sociedad industrializada llena de problemas, personas y exigencias, que no los dejaran cumplir sus sueños y fantasías de una vida feliz.\nSi bien, el filme no cuenta con la personificación de un antagonista como tal, se podría decir que Chaplin busca proyectar que el verdadero enemigo de los personajes es el sistema capitalista y a base de las maquinas en el que viven. Siendo esto lo que provoca que los trabajadores sean explotados hasta más no poder para así arruinar sus vidas, siendo abordado en el filme de una manera cómica cuando el protagonista es hospitalizado.\nEn este sentido, se podría decir que la película se desarrolla posiblemente entre los años después del gran crack de 1929 en los Estados Unidos, una época en la cual muchos empleados quedaron sin trabajo y tuvieron que verse en situaciones difíciles para sobrevivir, dejando muchas veces su felicidad a un lado. \nEsto se menciona porque dentro del filme se ven diferentes hechos en los que los trabajadores realizan manifestaciones en busca de libertad y de sus derechos laborales, pero que son oprimidos por la policía. E incluso se puede observar como las demandas de trabajo son inmensas y que, si no tienen la suerte necesaria, o alguna referencia de otras personas, se vuelve difícil tener una oportunidad. \nPor lo que el punto central de los personajes se basa en la búsqueda de la felicidad pero que, de acuerdo a lo que les ha hecho creer la sociedad es que para conseguir esa felicidad necesitan dinero, y que para tener dinero necesitan trabajar ardua e incansablemente. Un mensaje que se desarrolla a lo largo de la película pero que no resulta pesado o aburrido.\nY, que es una cinta que no posee sorprendentes detalles estéticos, gusta, entretiene y transmite el mensaje sutilmente, gracias a la interpretación cómica y a base de gestos con los que actúa Charles Chaplin, quien es también fue el encargado de realizar el sonido para la película.\nEn relación a esto, es sorprende que, si bien el filme no cuenta con diálogos como tal para impulsar el mensaje, sino solo frases sueltas en ciertos momentos, la sonorización y los efectos de sonido cumplen el papel de transmitir las emociones y sensaciones al público junto a las actuaciones. Por lo que el sonido va más allá de solo ambientar, sino que, funciona como complemento de la idea general que se busca transmitir. \nEn este aspecto se vuelve interesante la apuesta que se hace entre el cine sonoro y el cine mudo ya que constituyen una mezcla de dos momentos importantes para el desarrollo de este arte. Así mismo, da curiosidad pensar sobre el impacto que tuvo esta película de drama y comedia en las personas de ese tiempo. \nAdemás, esta es una cinta que se desarrolla a las puertas de una segunda guerra mundial y después de una crisis económica, por lo que de alguna manera la película es bastante revolucionaria tanto técnicamente como en el mensaje que busca transmitir. Ya que incluso hasta estas fechas los temas que aborda siguen teniendo vigencia o son bastante similares a los que se ilustran en la historia.\nUna historia que se presenta de una forma bastante interesante ya que desde las primeras escenas se puede ver como el director intenta hacer una comparación entre los animales y los humanos al mostrar imágenes de cerdos que se desvanecen sobre una toma con personas. \nDe esta manera la película logra conectar y contar una historia fluida de una ficción de la realidad, abordada desde la diversión. Con un guión que se basa solo en la presentación de los personajes sin profundizar tanto en lo que ellos y enfrascándose en lo que ellos buscan del mundo.\nUna historia que prevalece a pesar de ser tiempos modernos diferentes y que muestra que muchos problemas solo se siguen repitiendo una y otra vez a lo largo del tiempo. Sin embargo, al final de la película el director logra transmitir el mensaje que posiciona el amor, sobre todo. Ya que, a pesar de no tener nada, ambos personajes se tienen el uno para el otro, apoyándose mutuamente y sobreviviendo juntos.\nTiempos Modernos fue y sigue siendo una película bastante adelantada a su tiempo con respecto a la forma con la que Chaplin logra transmitir el mensaje. Esto porque su producto entretiene y hasta estas sigue haciéndolo gracias a su uso de la comedia y su forma de narrar la historia de una cinta que fue estrenada en 1936. Por lo que es importante hacer una reflexión individual sobre hacia a donde vamos nosotros como personas dentro de una sociedad llena de exigencias y ante revoluciones industriales y tecnológicas.",

Most of all Modern Times is his fundamental socialistic and humanistic question to where the modern human race is heading.

The list of the best filmmaker never needed any update.\n\nModern Times\n\nCharlie Chaplin is in his prime stage now. Now as in then when the film came out. And prime stage as in both, his narrative skills and performance. Today we're not going to boast about the social and political satire and other changes that the film deals with. But the body language that takes place in this film. The importance of this universal language is something we all know and understand. And here it spews wonder like some winning rap in a rap battle does. And I don't mean the obvious visual galore that is captured by camera tricks to serve the humor and wow factor. But I am talking about just Charlie's control over his body.\n\nHe is insanely in command of his body. There is not a fumble, not a trip, not a wave that is accidental. Even when he is.. nay, especially when he is out of control, he is still dancing the dance of his life. And I say that for the images that he could not be in charge of. As in, he doesn't just do his stunts or whatever you may like to call it, only once but does it frequently, does it fast, does it smooth.\n\nExcept for that dive in the shallow water, he is giving meticulous set pieces that are emotionally motivated, continuously. Now, coming back to the theme of Modern Times. I don't want to use the term ahead of its time, but it is. And its maturity and philosophy is why it remains to be one of my favourite Charlie Chaplin adventures. The love story looks like an excuse, just as it should be. The sacrificial act isn't actually sacrificial. To me, it was a proposal. A proposal to be a friend. A good hard working friend.",

            "content": "The final scene in â~Modern Timesâ(TM) is stunning, and in many ways.  There is a message of hope amidst the poverty of the Depression, with Chaplinâ(TM)s responding to Goddard feeling overwhelmed and defeated by saying âBuck up - never say die. We'll get along!â? (and lip-reading after that, perhaps âSmile, Câ(TM)mon!â?).  We then see his signature move, walking off down the road, but this time he isnâ(TM)t alone, he has Goddard with him, which could be viewed as overcoming through love and togetherness, or perhaps Chaplinâ(TM)s real-life marriage to her.   The most tingly interpretation for me, however, is as a symbol of end of the silent era.  Chaplin retired his the character of the Tramp with this film, and while he uses sound in some very creative ways, itâ(TM)s mostly silent.  Long after almost all other movies had become talkies, when I see this iconic character walking off down the road, I really feel like itâ(TM)s a final good-bye to an era, which gives me goosebumps.\n\nChaplin is also absolutely brilliant in the filmâ(TM)s very impressive opening scene.  Heâ(TM)s an assembly line worker who tightens bolts to some non-descript part as they rapidly stream by, having to work very hard to keep up.  He and his fellow workers have been made into machines, watched over with technology ahead of its time, with his boss able to see and talk to him via giant monitors, including one in the washroom.  In a hilarious scene, his boss uses him as the guinea pig for a new device meant to improve efficiency â\" an automated feeding machine.  Chaplin is strapped in and must endure the machine going haywire through various courses of a meal.  Itâ(TM)s one of the funniest sequences Iâ(TM)ve ever seen.  The film seems like it may be heading for a critique of automation, with Chaplin dehumanized, humiliated, suffering from repetitive motion, and breaking down, but it expands in to more than that.  \n\nThrough the character of a gamin (Paulette Goddard), we see the poverty of the times.  Itâ(TM)s ironic that the efforts made by engineers to develop an automated feeding machine are soon followed by Goddard stealing bananas for poor children and her family.   It seems to be saying that the best minds should be working less on maximizing corporate profits by attempting to automate the most basic of human activities, eating, and more on making sure that everyone has enough to eat.  Eating is a recurring theme in the film, with machines â~swallowing upâ(TM) workers at times, and a thief explaining âwe ain't burglars - we're hungry.â?  Chaplin realizes at one point that heâ(TM)s better off locked up in prison, where he has a place to sleep and gets fed.\n\nThe film touches on other aspects of the times.  Chaplin is inadvertently swept up into socialist strikes.  He also accidentally consumes some ânose candyâ?, and in a very amusing, cocaine-fueled frenzy, he stops other prisoners from escaping.  Later heâ(TM)ll also accidentally drink a lot of rum.  In addition to the comedic effect these things have, perhaps itâ(TM)s showing us that sometimes people are just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that while socialism and drugs are such serious topics, there is a silliness to the things we do.  The House Un-American Activities Committee took a dimmer view, however, believing the film to be further evidence of Chaplin being a communist.  Itâ(TM)s ironic, because if you think about it, Chaplinâ(TM)s character doesnâ(TM)t really have a problem with getting jobs, he just loses them (usually through incompetence), and his message at the end is one of hope.  Heâ(TM)s not saying letâ(TM)s overthrow the wealthy and levelize society, heâ(TM)s just saying letâ(TM)s treat people with humanity and respect, including those at the bottom of society.\n\nWhile it has social commentary, the film feels very lighthearted, and has many charming moments.  Chaplin is a very graceful roller skater during an extended sequence, and has some funny dance moves.  His â~nonsenseâ(TM) song towards the end is fantastic, and I was impressed that he also composed the filmâ(TM)s score, which is quite catchy and was the basis for the Nat King Cole song â~Smileâ(TM).  There are of course slapstick elements and pratfalls peppered throughout, some of which work better than others.  Overall, itâ(TM)s a brilliant film by a true giant in the industry, and a must-view.",

One of the opening scenes on the assembly line was hilarious if viewed on the surface but on a different level also made me anxious and feel sorry for the Tramp, as he became an example of what industrialization and capitalism can do to the human spirit.

And this rare genius is completely deployed in 'Modern Times', Chaplin's devastating, hilarious satire of industrialization where slapstick has never been more noble, never been more justified. 'Modern Times' is an expressive, thoroughly witty film, made of brilliant sequences (especially those in the prison and factory), whose characters are overwhelming, and whose score (also Chaplin's work) magnifies its silences. Chaplin's silent film is a masterpiece of communication and language.",

            "content": "The fear of Chaplin and his tramp Carlitos is the fear of the common man. The uncertainty of a world that in the measure of its modernity, excludes the individual and the spaces for the human feeling.\n\n\"Modern Times\" uses the facet of satire and at certain times of the parody to result in a critical and conscious comedy. It promotes a laughter contained in a world where the population is comparable to a flock grazed by large corporations and corporations, and even being a film scripted and directed by Charlie Chaplin in 1936, has a strong prophetic or futuristic character, timeless and certainly helplessness, when we reflect In the position of the contemporary world.\n\nChaplin in \"Modern Times\" already philosophized on so many important issues that when reviewing his films, we were amazed by his futuristic vision in terms of technology with surveillance systems monitored by cameras, a mix of reality show with face time, (Such as Skype), voice messaging (WhatsApp), digital recording, and the interference of man's banal activities, such as having lunch, being interfered with by machines and everything to ensure more work efficiency, Wasted time with human activities.\n\nIn addition to the technological advances, there is in the film, or at least in its first part, an analysis of the effects and reflexes of modernity on man and the world, expressed by relations of subordination and power, by the totalitarianism of business groups and by the inexpressiveness of trade union movements Which result in meager advances and are brutally repressed by the police force. A well-presented paradox in the film is how man has managed to advance in technological modernities that, on the other hand, only increase the differences of social classes, generating groups concentrated by industrial power and a whole mass that is at the mercy of a great employment opportunity Part exploratory and enslaved. Living in miserable conditions, in a daily struggle for survival and without the prospect of a better future, there is nothing left but a passive position of the people, who fulfills their expectations with dreams and fantasies of consumption and a life less unworthy.\n\nThe critical character of \"Modern Times\" knows how to measure well the moments of comedy, in fact, they mix in a homogeneous mass so well structured that allows the public, if it so wishes, to stick only to moments of comedy, but if you want, Just look more closely and we can see and see our world through a critical humor perspective. Perhaps the fear of Chaplin and his tramp Carlitos is the fear of the common man. The uncertainty of a world that in the measure of its modernity, excludes the individual and the spaces for the human feeling.\n\nParticularly, I believe in an attempt by Chaplin to soften his critical stance, for, in structuring the script of \"Modern Times,\" the story is divided into chapters that resemble chapters, and which can, as a filmmaking feature, be relocated without Major implications, since the dependence of one chapter does not strongly interfere with another. This structure that border the sketch or \"sketch\", are, in my opinion, a weak and harmful feature to the film. So much that the resolution for this is a passage of days, there are no missing cards that inform the next action (chapter), it occurs ten, seven, five, two days later or within weeks. This division is so explicit that we can structure the film in the following way:\n\nChapter I - Factory;\nChapter II - The Prisoner of the Tramp\nChapter III - The Life of the Poor Girl;\n\nJust in the middle of the movie, we have an unfolding of this critical and political comedy for a romantic comedy that nothing resembles the initial idea proposed to the film. The only vestige that remains of this trait is in the labor relations, the search for a job and a change of life.\n\nWith the proviso to the slip of his narrative structure, you had a great work, and one more impeccable work of Chaplin. When \"Modern Times\" was made, cinema already had the sound feature, but Chaplin, mainly for his ideologies of creating a universal art cinema, which was not hampered by differences of languages ??and other motives, remained faithful to the comic of mimicry , Which made him deservedly famous and admired all over the world.\n\n\nConversely to those who say of their fear of using the soundtrack, we have in this film a Chaplin conscious of the advances of the sound and that knows to take advantage of that, the sound is presented as a technology that allows the sending of recorded messages, in the sound games like beats In the door that serve to confuse the actions, in the use of a radio to inhibit the sound of the gastritis and where the radio announcer remembers exactly to take the medicine to heal this evil and especially the sound, like match point of the history. If the hobo can not get a joint job, how about trying life as an artist? But for this it is necessary to sing, therefore he who never speaks. The result",

I think, while some of the comedy vignettes were better in Modern Times than in City Lights (the other Chaplin film I've seen,) the underlying story was stronger in the latter. I must admit I came close to losing interest with this one. Luckily, the next big comedy sequence would roll around and drag me back in. Overall, Modern Times had some ups and downs.

I mostly am strict about not watching movies released before 1960s since I neither can connect with them nor appreciate the technology used. But this movie baffled me on both fronts dealing with everlasting topics like employee management, changing times, love and hope bundled in beautifully orchestrated scenes like the blindfolded skating, video teleconferencing and automation. Considering the frame rate, scope size, loud background score, this movie didn't put me off as much as I thought it would with a large help from the screen presence of beautiful Paulette Goddard. \n\nA Factory Worker (Charlie Chaplin) works in a large manual assembly line and due to his hypnotic work schedule goes into a temporary nervous breakdown causing havoc in the operations. When sent to jail, due to a freak accident and a bizarre incident ends up thwarting an escape plan by fellow prisoners thus building a rapport with the police. With the outside world crumbling in union strikes, unemployment and hunger, the little tramp seems to be making a good life for himself inside the prison walls. When the day finally comes for his release, he makes up his mind to do something to get back to prison which is when he meets a beautiful but down on her luck young girl A Gamin (Paulette Goddard). \n\nChaplin's entire screenplay revolves around coincidences, pure good or bad luck and how he deals with his positive outlook. Though loud, light hearted and in your face on the outset - the power of human spirit, current political satire and hope are always the underlying themes of most of his movies. The perfection of the finished product is easily seen in most of the scenes which actually looked quite technologically superior for its time. Paulette Goddard looked gorgeous and her pleasing presence elevates the likability of the movie. The background score has some melodious tunes but mostly spoiled by the loudness and acoustic nature of the sound available at the time. The comic choreography is very imaginative and actually has a very solid plot even with very little said. \n\nBrilliant comic choreography with a story relevant to this day",

            "content": "Considered to be one of Charlie Chaplin's greatest achievements, Modern Times sounded like a hilarious slapstick piece\n\nModern Times is a film that drew Charlie Chaplin accusation of luddism as he refused to move into sound cinema and instead dedicated himself to keeping the vaudevillian spirit alive in the face of changing times. Looking at the film in a contemporary age where all the man's films have nostalgic value, it is clear that Modern Times is one of his finest works. To call the man a luddist is to say Quentin Tarantino is a plagarist.\nModern Times is essentially the Tramp's journey into Metropolis. As a means of ensuring this, the production values in the feature are really effective. The production design of Modern Times is beautiful.Cleverly making use of only a selective few locations to tell its story, Modern Times manages to make the most out of all of them. Each scene in the film takes place in a different location, yet the scenes are stretched out so that there is a sense that the potential in all of them is maximized. The result is a lot of creative hilarity from the many situations where Charlie Chaplin takes his slapstick to brilliant extents. Some of the imagery in the film is the most iconic of Charlie Chaplin's entire career, including the sight of him being grinded between cogs. The humour always makes use of the universe around the characters and the entire experience is captured with fine cinematography that really turns it all into wonderful imagery while working with the movements of Charlie Chaplin.  And with so much of the footage in Modern Times being sped-up, the slapstick comes at viewers a lot faster and condenses the energy of the film into a swift 83 minutes of consistent laughter. The genuine feeling of it all is kept alive by the musical score which keeps consistently flowing at a fast rate with lighthearted jonty tunes during the funnier moments of the film which also oscillate with the more sentimental tone that comes into the dramatic sequences. Rarely does the humour drag on, but at the same time it is not solely dedicated to the physical comedy side of things.\nThough Modern Times is clearly dictated to be a stylie-driven slapstick comedy, there is an extent of social commentary in the story which cannot be disregarded. Though it is subtle, there are intelligent comments regarding suvival of the Great Depression and attempts to maintain employment in the face of the industrial age. All of this is buried into the comedy within the narrative so that it gives viewers a chance to laugh while they have their thoughts challenged. These plot points do not get in the way of the narrative being a joyful comedy, but they do demand the viewer's consideration. They play second fiddle to the humour in the film which ensures that it is a comedy at heart and therefore not precisely as meaningful as some of his other works where the use of dialogue is a significant factor in conveying what truly goes on in the mind of Charlie Chaplin, but the elements of political commentary are represented very well by the imagery in the film and serve to give an unprecedented level of depth to the extensive slapstick spectacle. \nThe recurring word to determine value in Modern Times is the term \"slapstick\", and it is sourced almost solely from the efforts of lead actor Charlie Chaplin. With a clear passion for the film as writer and director, Charlie Chaplin takes Modern Times' material by storm when he enters the screen because he captures his character with every inch of the part from the smallest elements of his facial expressions to his most over the top antics. Charlie Chaplin's natural gimmicks are as refreshing as ever, proving to be the backbone of the film which takes it through the entirety of its 83 minute running time. And yet, there are also some moments where he is really able to bring a touch of suble drama to the film. Though his voice is not heard, Charlie Chaplin evokes a sense of emotional frailty based on the smallest elements of his character since he really sinks his teeth into every inch of the role. And as the final silent film to feature him portraying The Tramp in a leading role, Modern Times proves to be a very heartfelt sendoff for the legendary character archetype, so it is ultimately a hilarious and bittersweet effort on behalf of Charlie Chaplin which never fails to leave audiences of all different times and ages laughing at the sight of a clownish man falling into machinery\nPaulette Goddard also does a lovely effort. Playing the romantic opposite of the protagonist, Paulette Goddard is not around with the intention of making audiences laugh. She is there to make them feel, and she does a lovely job of that. The level of sympathy she intends to establish is limited by the nature of the film as a silent movie, and yet she transcends that because even as she speaks in silence there is a sense of beautiful passion in her maner of delivering it. She has a smile which just lights up the screen and a determined sense of energy which she uses to keep herself consistently physically active. Paulette Goddard easily has audiences captivated by her naturally beautiful charms, so she is most welcome to be working alongside Charlie Chaplin as she interacts with his passion for physical humour with natural instict, meaning that she keeps up with the pace of the humour in Modern Times with ease.\n\nSo Modern Times delivers more of the hilarious slapstick that fans of Charlie Chaplin have come to expect, raising the scale with increased production values and increasing the genuine credibility of the film with the addition of intelligent political commentary in the subtext.",

Full of cool and clever special effects and plenty of moments to make you laugh. Chaplin did such a good job of creating such a silly little character. The story was creative and fascinating, with imaginative concepts and energetic cinematography. It was a fun watch for sure. Delightfully absurd, yet it did give voice to the woes of unemployment and the voracious appetite of capitalism at the price of some disposable human equipment. Silliness with a sting. I recommend it!\n\n8/10\n\nBye love you",

The Great Depression was an appropriate setting for the tale of a hapless assembly line worker who suffers nervous breakdowns and multiple misunderstandings that leads to multiple stints at the local jail. However, like most of Chaplin's films the dark definitions get lost in their own subtlety and Chaplin's still-funny onscreen antics. Things get even brighter when Paulette Goddard enters as the homeless woman who joins The Tramp in his fight for survival, as her tomboyish persona melds perfectly and gives the shot of upbeat attitude that cements Modern Time's legendary status. Everything, from The Tramp being fed through a maze of cogs, to the gibberish musical number, to the final title card (the last title card from the silent era) are the stuff classics are made of.",

Not only is it hilariously funny and bitter-sweet but it has social commentary too.  Chaplin takes aim at the dehumanizing effect of factory work, and the general way workers are treated.  While the picture he paints makes us laugh, rather than make us angry, behind the comedy there is a lot of truth.  This satire is still relevant today.  It doesn't have to be factories, it could be any workplace.\n\nSuperb direction by Chaplin. He is more known for his acting antics and creative scripts but the camerawork here is fantastic.\n\nOther than the all-round Chaplin brilliance, the other standout in the movie is Paulette Goddard, who plays his love interest.  Beautiful with an endearing waifishness, impishness and sense of humour, she matches Chaplin step for step.  (She was to become Chaplin's third wife shortly after the movie was released).\n\nAn all-time classic.",

By 1936 everyone was watching talkies and they expected Modern Times to be Chaplin's first one considering his previous film, City Lights, had already incorporated some sound effects five years ago. Modern Times is considered one of Chaplin's finest movies and perhaps a lot of it has to do with the fact that it was his last silent film so it has the nostalgic factor going for it. The way Chaplin incorporates sound in Modern Times is pure genius because the only moments where we hear sound is when they come from mechanical devices, so in a way he blended the social critique of the Industrial age with his own critique of the use of sound in film. This mechanical monster that was taking over his industry was putting an end to the silent era which made him such a popular figure. Chaplin may have stated that his films aren't social critiques, but I don't think anyone managed to capture the human spirit during that era better than he did. During the first hour of this film which I earnestly enjoyed I couldn't quite understand why this film was considered superior to his other films which I enjoyed more. Up to that moment there wasn't really a scene that stood out for me like there had been in all his other features. Then suddenly when I was about to lose hope came the restaurant scene where the Tramp performs a song where we can't understand what he's saying, but through his gestures he makes himself perfectly understood. That was the scene that sold this movie for me and reminded me of Chaplin's genius. The ending in Modern Times is perhaps my favorite ending in all of Chaplin's films, although I still think I would rank City Lights as his best film. \n\nIn his last silent film Charles Chaplin stars as the Tramp once again, and this time we find him working at an assembly line in a factory. The quick working pace and the mechanized movements he has to make slowly begin to affect him. He can't keep up with the pace in the assembly line and production is delayed because of him. During a lunch break he is chosen for experimentation with an automatic feeding machine that they want to sell to the president of the steel corporation. The machine goes haywire and the Tramp also begins to lose his sanity so he is sent to a mental hospital. Eventually he is released but after an unfortunate incident he is mistaken for a communist and imprisoned. In prison he becomes a hero by stopping several prisoners from breaking out of jail so he is released. Unemployed and unable to find a job all he wants is to go back to prison, but when he meets a Gamin (Paulette Goddard) and falls in love with her, he makes it his goal to find a job and buy a house where the two can live happily ever after, but in these modern times it won't be an easy task.\n\nCharlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard have excellent chemistry together although the film is a little too sentimental at times. In Modern Times, Chaplin manages to once again balance pathos with slapstick, but I found some of the scenarios to be a little too similar to his other films so I felt it was getting a bit repetitive. However, what Chaplin does really well here is include the social elements of the time and use it to his advantage by focusing on the struggle the people had adapting to the modern industrial age. He does this by using satire through his brilliant physical comedy. In an era of dehumanization, Chaplin humanizes Modern Times with a sweet and tender story reminding everyone that the obstacles can be overcome. With every new problem that the Tramp has to face somehow he always finds a way to remain hopeful and rise to the occasion. That is perhaps why his comedies still remain timeless and continues to touch the hearts of those who encounter Chaplin for the first time.

            "content": "I was never particularly interesting in seeing silent films, but my recent viewing of Hugo, a wonderful piece of film dedicated to silent cinema, got me interested in seeing silent films. Hearing that the most famous silent star was Charlie Chaplin, my first big experience with silent cinema started with Modern Times, which would be Chaplin's final silent film before going into sound.\n\nWhat I didn't realize was how talented Chaplin actually is. I never realized that he directed films or even scored them. With Modern Times, Chaplin delights in the direction and music and even touches audiences with his story about industrialized America.\n\nIn Modern Times, Chaplin plays a factory worker during The Great Depression (which, incidentally, the film came out during the real deal) but goes crazy due to the new machines being added to the place. After recovering in an asylum, Chaplin is mistaken for a communist leader and ends up in jail. When released after foiling a prison riot, Chaplin meets an orphaned girl (Paulette Goddard) who spends her time in the streets earning a living. The rest of the film focuses on Chaplin's attempts to find work and helping the girl find a home to live.\n\nWhat impresses me the most about Modern Times is that it's a silent film released in 1936, a time when silent cinema had been long dead and more and more sound film were being made.  Originally, Chaplin was interested in making this a sound picture, but instead decided to do it the old-fashioned way, but does add sound effects, such as talking machines, gunshots, and smacks on the door. Had this been a sound picture, I don't believe the film would have worked as well.\n\nCharlie Chaplin is a talented comedian, and this film proves it. Modern Times shows Chaplin in the funniest sequences. Chaplin falls inside one of the machines, goes crazy after unintentionally having  \"nose-powder\" , and even has a time fixing roast duck in a restaurant. Chaplin even sings in the film, and it's a real delight.\n\nSurprisingly put in a comedy is the drama added throughout the film, especially from Goddard's character. In her opening scenes, we see her father get shot and killed in a raid, and her younger sisters taken away by officials. These scenes make you root for her more and it makes the relationship between her and Chaplin work (they would later marry, making the romance that more realistic).\n\nWith his final silent film, Charlie Chaplin proves without a doubt that he is a talented director, a talented comedian, and a talented composer. Modern Times is funny, touching, and full of Chaplin energy. Now I need to look into his other films and other famous silent films.",

Some bits are cornier and more dated than others, but all showcase Charlie's outstanding comic timing and extraordinary athleticism.

In retrospective, of course, Modern Times provided not only the most wonderful final send off for the character of The Tramp, the character which had brought his maker to unparalleled fame, but also for silent films as a whole, particularly with that unforgettable final shot of the tramp and the homeless girl walking from foreground to background towards a beautiful sunset. Forgetting all its historical symbolism as well as the usual sweet hearted poetry, Modern Times is as much a hilarious slapstick comedy as it is a hard edged satire on the ridiculousness and futility of mechanical advancements in the modern world, something which went quite the opposite way from the trend of industrialisation of the start of the twentieth century. Then again, Chaplin was never known to have gone with the flow, whereas his final silent film has a charm that has inspired many more films which followed it.",

In this film, The Tramp becomes more than an extension of vaudeville; he stands in for the poor everyman, and as a result Chaplin's work takes on a profundity and significance unique to him.\nThe filmmaking, or the direction, is quite strong.  While this was supposed to be Chaplin's first talkie, it works better in the genre Super Reviewer Alice Shen calls a \"neo-silent film\" (she coins this phrase in reference to The Artist).  Chaplin's use of sound occurs at strategic moments in the narrative: the corporate boss can speak as he has entered the mechanized age, but The Tramp stays mostly silent, only once singing in gibberish.  Chaplin sets up the conflict between the ways of the past and the future in the film's technique as well as its theme.\nI did think that the film occasionally fell into slapstick and schtick, abandoning its central concerns, but these moments were rare in the grand scheme of the film.\nOverall, Modern Times ranks among Limelight and The Great Dictator as one of Chaplin's finest films.",

            "content": "Arguably the first great superstar of film, Charlie Chaplin was the man known simply as the Tramp in his silent movies. For this reason Modern Times seems like the perfect bridge between the early silent era and the age of talkies starting in the late 1920s. Chaplin had many successes earlier including The Gold Rush (1926) and City Lights (1931). However, people wanted to hear talking and soon enough everyone would have to make the transition or else die out. Because of Chaplin's popularity he was able to make one last great silent picture. From that point on however it got a lot louder in theaters. In this film the iconic Tramp character finds himself up against modern technology and the Great Depression. The whole movie seems to be critiquing factories, the police, the economy, and even modern film by using little actual dialogue. With that being said, this is a great film which exhibits everything that made Chaplin famous. He still has that walk, that mustache, and new hilarious antics to accompany everything else. Yet again there is a love story, between a tramp and a beautiful homeless girl played by Paulette Goddard (Only in the movies). Despite all the hardships they face this resilient pair amazingly still have hope. Fittingly, in the end the two lovebirds walk off into the background, seeming to bring the end of the Chaplin golden era, but also leaving us with a feeling of hope for the future.",

Charlie Chaplin took the depression and the problems it caused and found a way to make you laugh it off. Modern times is an addition to the classic movies of the last 100 years, as it stands out as one extremely funny movie, that you have to see before you leave the earth.\n\nModern times is a movie done in 1936, that depicts Chaplin's take on the modern world and what industrialization brought with it. Set during the Great Depression era the movie's plot is about how the tramp was coping with the depression and with him was an orphan who too was struggling with the causes of the depression.\n\nOur Tramp also discovered that life in jail is better than life outside.\n\nChaplin had long been against \"talkie\" and his last film before this City Lights (1931) was a silent film and he began preparing for this flick in 1934, and it was supposed to be his first \"talkie\", but he later abandoned the idea of making a talkie because he felt the world was not ready to hear the tramp talk.\nThe movie does have some dialogue, but that can be found in the early scenes soon after the movie went back to the silent film genre. Nearing the ending there is a scene where Chaplin's tramp had to sing to keep his job, this scene was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard in any movie. The song that the tramp sang (the song is known as The Nonsense Song) was Léo Daniderff's comical song Je cherche après Titine. This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie as Chaplin's version of Léo Daniderff's song was all gibberish with the lyrics being a mixture of French and Italian words in a nonsensical manner that it made no sense but his comical gestures tell the story of what he actually meant.\n\nThe movie's opening scene shows where the tramp was in a factory and he had to keep up with the speed of production, this scene has been used by many filmmakers even Disney and in the sitcom I Love Lucy used the idea.\n\nModern Times, is my 2nd favorite Chaplin movie after City Lights and the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) rated the movie78 in its list of 100. There is no reason why you should not get a feel of one of the best Chaplin's film out there, so find it and watch it.\n\nwww.lagsreviews.com",

I mostly am strict about not watching movies released before 1960s since I neither can connect with them nor appreciate the technology used. But this movie baffled me on both fronts dealing with everlasting topics like employee management, changing times, love and hope bundled in beautifully orchestrated scenes like the blindfolded skating, video teleconferencing and automation. Considering the frame rate, scope size, loud background score, this movie didn't put me off as much as I thought it would with a large help from the screen presence of beautiful Paulette Goddard.\r\n\r\nA Factory Worker (Charlie Chaplin) works in a large manual assembly line and due to his hypnotic work schedule goes into a temporary nervous breakdown causing havoc in the operations. When sent to jail, due to a freak accident and a bizarre incident ends up thwarting an escape plan by fellow prisoners thus building a rapport with the police. With the outside world crumbling in union strikes, unemployment and hunger,  the little tramp seems to be making a good life for himself inside the prison walls. When the day finally comes for his release, he makes up his mind to do something to get back to prison which is when he meets a beautiful but down on her luck young girl A Gamin (Paulette Goddard).\r\n\r\nChaplin's entire screenplay revolves around coincidences, pure good or bad luck and how he deals with his positive outlook. Though loud, light hearted and in your face on the outset - the power of human spirit, current political satire and hope are always the underlying themes of most of his movies. The perfection of the finished product is easily seen in most of the scenes which actually looked quite technologically superior for its time. Paulette Goddard looked gorgeous and her pleasing presence elevates the likability of the movie. The background score has some melodious tunes but mostly spoiled by the loudness and acoustic nature of the sound available at the time. The comic choreography is very imaginative and actually has a very solid plot even with very little said.\r\n\r\nBrilliant comic choreography with a story relevant to this day",

            "content": "By 1930, \"Talkies\" were a Hollywood staple; a game-changing technology that slowly but surely eclipsed the landscape of film. Yet in 1936, Charlie Chaplin released Modern Times, an antediluvian \"silent\" film, and moreover, a thinly-veiled critique of the country's capitalist devotion to industry; for the times, a brazen choice. Of the decision to avoid recorded dialogue Chaplin said: \"Action is more generally understood than words. Like Chinese symbolism, it will mean different things according to its scenic connotation.\" While not terribly poetic, this devotion to action effectively reveals Chaplin's philosophy as a filmmaker. And it certainly jives with Chaplin the Performer, who spent years winning over audiences with his balletic pratfalls and boozer's grace. As for Modern Times, it is a beautiful depiction of Chaplin's one of a kind \"action,\" depicting an artist and performer deeply in his prime. For those of us more familiar with contemporary cinema (i.e. more talking in our movies), Modern Times is a wonderful introduction to a bygone era, and the waddling genius who will forever be associated with it.\n\nChaplin's first notably political film begins in a hyper-industrial factory, where filthy men spend long hours performing ambiguously-difficult tasks on a production line, and a white-haired CEO of presumed wealth sits in an office doing a jigsaw puzzle. Chaplin's Tramp is slowly coming unhinged thanks to the exhausting work, and when his boss tests an automated feeding device on him-to predictably disastrous results-he breaks, running amok in the factory, and eventually being hauled off to the insane asylum. Upon his release, the Tramp is immediately mistaken for the leader of a strike, and taken to prison. As the film progresses, so do these serendipitous calamities, with Chaplin always on the verge of doing something either fantastically terribly or terribly fantastic.\n\nChaplin's method as a director was far more improvisational than one might think. He would often begin with an essential premise, building in visual gags and allowing the story to grow around them. This is an important thing to understand about Modern Times, as it certainly follows a strange path to get from A to B to C, and doesn't really follow a three-act structure. However, inasmuch as Chaplin's goal was to present as visually dynamic a story as he could, his technique paid out handsomely; any number of scenes can be singled out as eye candy in Modern Times. By '36 Chaplin had perfected his skills as a director, and surrounded himself with all kinds of talent, from other strong performers to fantastic set designers. All of which resulted in an unforgettable visual experience. Modern Times offers Chaplin a variety of playgrounds to use as he sees fit, and his performances are notably different depending on the circumstances. While his nervous breakdown in the factory is off-the-wall and a bit demented, a later scene finds Chaplin blindfolded and rollerskating balletically on the second floor of a shopping mall, inches from a potentially fatal fall. It is these moments in particular when Charlie Chaplin earns his spot as the focal point of the silent film era. He is simply a wonderment on screen, composing visual set pieces that are the Depression Era equivalent of today's multimillion dollar CG work.\n\nStill, while Modern Times and Chaplin could comfortably hold the attention of a toddler, a dominant tone in the film is cynicism. Certainly Chaplin's Tramp is a sweet-hearted character, as is his mostly platonic female companion (Paulette Goddard), but these two are a clear exception. At every turn, the Tramp must deal with distrustful authority figures, more inclined to chuck him into a cell than hear an explanation. This is almost certainly a class commentary, though there's an element of true naivety to it as well. Often Chaplin's Tramp feels like a child, his small stature and perpetual restlessness having as much to say about the character as anything. Seeing the 5'5? scamp bump up against a stern-looking police officer, his eyes characteristically wide, it's hard not to remember the feeling of sheer terror when, as a child, you got an pretty much any kind of trouble. And while this nostalgic sense of authority allows audiences to quickly connect to the Tramp's latest predicament, it also reveals Charlie Chaplin's opinion of authority figures of any sort. Broadly, they are bad, cruel, prone to taking advantage, and disinclined to help.\n\nBut as the end of Modern Times suggests, that's not the whole story. While the world is a hard place, and making one's way is ultimately a high-stakes gamble, it's not an impossibility. In fact, while Modern Times takes a decidedly pessimistic view of the world at large, Chaplin's last major silent work deals ultimately with the joy and necessity of companionship. While adversity must be faced, it needn't be faced alone. In the end, the Tramp once more makes a hasty getaway, arm in arm with his devoted protege, and as the pair walk down a desolate road to nowhere, they do so in the rosy haze of \"us.\"",

            "content": "At a time when the art of filmmaking was rapidly churning toward the future, Chaplin was still fighting a one-man battle in favor of silent films. Famously he didn't think much of talking pictures and predicted that they would die out in five years. So, he gleefully pressed on, working his magic in, what was perceived, as a dead art form. Chaplin's contemporaries thought he was behind the times and he continued to fight a battle by keeping his films silent even though he didn't make many in the sound era. As punishment, his last two silent films, City Lights and Modern Times, did not receive one single nomination.\r\n\r\nNeither of the two silent films that he made after The Jazz Singer were totally silent, they incorporated sound effects and a line or two of dialogue, but both used sound as a means of being critical of the process. First was City Lights which opened with a political speech in which the audience only heard squawks coming from the speaker's mouths. The other was Modern Times, a red-blooded assault on madness of the machine age.\r\n\r\nModern Times wasn't his best film but it was certainly better than anything else released in 1936. It was one of his most important films mainly because it was his transition from silent to sound. Here he satirizes the process but there is a tone that suggests that he's ready to move on. It is the most technologically innovative of his works yet it remains silent. The only noises come from machines and the only voices are heard over a radio, a monitor and a phonograph. The message is that Chaplin will move into the sound age, but that doesn't mean he will give it any respect. The reason that the film is important is because it displays his best gifts for satire. His other films had satire but it bubbled under the surface - this film is more of a full-frontal assault. He exposes the madness of over-dependence on machines, the economic crisis, communist paranoia and man's never-ending pursuit food, glorious food.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, perhaps most famously, this is the film in which Chaplin bids farewell to The Tramp. There was some discussion of the possibility of giving the Tramp a speaking voice but Chaplin wouldn't hear of it. When the studio insisted on it, he created a moment in which the Tramp sings a song, an odd tune called \"Titania,\" sung in gibberish.\r\n\r\nFive years after City Lights, Chaplin uses The Tramp to show how the society has changed, how it has grown past his gentle nature and threatens to crush his fragile spirit. In the blistering maelstrom of The Great Depression (this was 1936) we find that The Tramp has had to join the work force, working ten hour days at a steel factory turning the bolts on a grotesque machine that frequently breaks down and constantly speeds up. As he turns the bolts on the conveyor belt, he has to catch up if he misses one. The machine finally swallows him, and The Tramp finds himself bending inside the machine's cogs, but he's so loopy that he doesn't even notice.\r\n\r\nAlthough the film finds The Tramp working it also underpins the same theme that Chaplin has always worked with, survival. After going insane, The Tramp is sent to a mental institution and after having been cured, the rest of the film chronicles his desperate search for work. At the docks he meets a gamine (Paulette Goddard), a plucky girl stealing bananas for her brothers and sisters. Food becomes a dominating goal for these two and one of the central themes of the picture: The gamin steals bananas and later bread; The Tramp is nearly killed by an automatic feeding machine that short circuits; The couple have cake in a department store where he works as the night watchman; He eats a very large meal that he can't pay for in order to get thrown in jail where he will have decent food and a roof over his head; Later when he gets his job back at the factory he stops to have lunch even though his supervisor is stuck inside the machine; And he fantasizes about his dream house and coming home to the wife . . . at dinnertime.\r\n\r\nThe world of Modern Times is not that far removed from Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Both films present a world besieged by the chaos of its own technology and both present the kinds of oppression that Orwell would brought to \"1984\". The inside world is a crush of machines and noise, the outside world is awash in riots, strikes and marches. The Tramp, as always finds himself caught in the middle of one damn thing after another. The message is that things are tough all over, but as The Tramp confides in the gamin to keep chin up and spirits high because if you keep trying eventually, it will all work out.\r\n\r\nMost of the Tramp's efforts come to nothing, just when he has something it blows away in the wind and he finds that he has to start all over again. This has been the theme of the Tramp all along and, given his determination, we know that he will never give up.\r\n\r\nIt's fitting that Chaplin's Tramp bows out in Modern Times, one more film and I think he would have become dated. The world has moved past him, it's grown too large and too fast for his gentle spirit to maintain. In the end we find him still searching for his dream, the difference is that in the end when he walks into the sunrise of a new day he doesn't go alone. With that, we know he'll be okay.",

He used some technological gimmicks to transcend the genre boundaries though and included sound effects and some speaking parts (mostly to display technical superiority).\r\n\r\nChaplin is arguably the most natural comedian in film history so Modern Times became an instant classic and modest box office success. His long-trained facial expressions and body language and some silly stunts still make it an entertaining watch - even for today's viewers.\r\n\r\nSlapstick silent doesn't work that well and it comes to discussing serious matters like unemployment because of economic crisis or the overpowering of workers through technology. Chaplin is able to satirize some of the aspects of the topic but he just can't seriously attack the issues when he roller-skates through a shopping center in the next scene.\r\nChaplin's political tendencies may have never been more obvious than here but on a serious level the film fails.\r\n\r\nThere's also a little forgettable love story in the film that further lightens the tone of the film and creates even more continuity havoc. The scenes themselves are really good and funny and the slapstick is great but how everything is put together can only be described as desastrous (maybe that's also because of the poor German intertitles).",

Modern Times is another classic film that I've recently seen, and it's wonderfully satirical and socially-conscious to boot. I have to say though that I found it just a step lower than his classic The Gold Rush. I found that film to be marvelous in nearly every aspect. This time around, I feel like the overriding theme and modern relevance to what was going on in the world at the time overrides the story itself. It's well-executed and expertly crafted, but The Gold Rush feels more timeless by comparison. It also seems to take a great deal of ideas from Fritz Lang's Metropolis, both visually and in a storytelling sense. It's not necessarily a bad thing because it does pave its own road and has its own ideas, but it feels a bit flat to me. That said, it's still a marvelously well-put together film and I look forward to more of them.",

Chaplin who plays a man during the great depression stuggles to stay afloat, but manages to prove that witts, will and caring can take you places. The best part is the famous Factory scene- and later having a mental breakdown (something that was frowned apon) he brings awareness to mental health.

I enjoy silent films, I mean of course its hard for some people of the modern age to sit through them, but the simplicity in their stories os fun and Chaplin uses it to his advantage.  By this time many people hadgave up on silent films, but Chaplin gives one final blow showing that silent films are still the golden age of Hollywood.  Chaplin's performance as The Tramp is still one of the most memorable characters ever and his goofy shennanigans at the start of the film and the machine that feeds him always makes me laugh.  Modern Times is a stunning film that has a great message that can be used even today, because many people are still out of work nowadays and a film like this can help a guy get up off his feet.  Chaplin sends the world a great message and does it with a lot of comic relief and a lot of fun, and its safe to say Modern Times is one of the greatest films ever made.",

This film is perfect for being made in the 30s and how enjoyable it is watching it now is amazing. Modern Times is less of a silent film than a lot of Chaplin's other works. There are some sound effects and very little dialogue that is heard. Most of the main dialogue is written on screen. Chaplin's directing is a work of art that is timeless.\n\nCharlie Chaplin is also the screenwriter of Modern Times. This film deals with unemployment and how everyone relies on factory work. I was taken by surprise how many times I laughed during this film. Modern Times is hilarious and the fact that it's from the 30s and is still comedic now is brilliant. There a really funny parts in this film like the feeding machine and the situations Chaplin's character puts himself into. Modern Times is ahead of its time story-wise and is great entertainment.\n\nCharlie Chaplin is the lead actor in Modern Times. His performance is very charismatic and you can't help to fall in love with it. Chaplin is always putting a smile on your face throughout this film, which perfect because it sucks you into the film even more. His performance really carries the film and makes you wanting more. \n\nModern Times is a timeless from the 30s and it'll be making my list of favorite comedies.

Along with a great plot and the comedic genius of Charlie Chaplin, the film has even more going for it. Chaplin himself composed the music used in the film, though he did have a little help from Alfred Newman in arranging it. The music is one of the most essential pieces to a silent movie and Chaplin is the master of silent film. The ensemble he made for this film is outstanding, giving just the right amount of mood to go with each scene or spicing up the slapstick of the film. Along with not only a great composition, Chaplin actually sings a part in the movie. His sputtering of nonsense and French gibberish while dancing is not only marvelously sounding, but the music that goes with it makes it that much better. In this movie, it is easy to say that the movie helps you feel the scene and connect on better scale than if it was done any other way.\n\nAs with every movie, the cinematography plays an important role in capturing the moments in just the right way. Ira Morgan and Roland Totheroh do an excellent job at capturing everything that is Chaplin. My favorite part cinematography point in the movie is when Chaplin is working as a waiter in the restaurant. Their use of timed zooming and panning made it as if you were rotating around the room with Chaplin. In the day this was filmed they didnâ(TM)t have the ability we have or the portability of the cameras as much as we do now. Their use of trick angles, timed panning and zooming made effects that today I donâ(TM)t think could be done any better or to even the same degree.\n\nThough this movie has great plot points, a direct link to the troubled times and growth of the industrial era as well as the depression. This movie, even today, connects with people because of the way Chaplin wrote it. Connecting to the audience of the time, their troubles, and what it was like out in the country was amazing. Though it does not just stop there, this film projects to everyone that watches it, the life of the common American, having to steal just to eat and sleep wherever you could find shelter. It is a timeless film that will forever keep Americans linked with their past and troubles of their old relatives. Modern Times may be a timeless film, but it has parts and pieces that in todayâ(TM)s time would provoke controversy. One of my favorite parts of the movie is the innocent mix up with the salt and nose powder. It was a very hilarious scene with him spoiling an attempted jail break and earning himself his freedom. As innocent as it sounds, drug scenes these days are viewed in a bad light and seen as improper (especially for a movie for all ages), but in the past werenâ(TM)t seen as bad at all. Along with this seemingly innocent scene, Chaplinâ(TM)s involvement with the juvenile delinquent (Paulette Goddard) is also an improper thing these days. In the past, relationships with minors (like 16 year olds) was not an uncommon thing, but today is a very serious offence and is most commonly viewed as disgusting, ending up in court rooms all over.",

Une situation qui n'empêche pas les capitaines d'industrie de plastronner sans vergogne, se gargarisant de leurs taux de croissance et de leurs courses à l'innovation technologique, alors que, plus simplement, l'homme de la rue se demande avec inquiétude de quoi demain sera fait.  Une situation qui indigne Charlie Chaplin, lui qui n'a jamais oublié ses débuts modestes à Londres.  Avec \"Les temps modernes\", il signe une satyre, fort controversée, de son époque à travers quelques unes de ses caractéristiques les plus absurdes, pour mieux condamner l'aliénation de l'homme qui découle de cette course vers le futur.  Dans un registre plus artistique, le cinéaste était persuadé que le cinéma parlant signerait la mort de son avatar à l'écran, aussi \"Les temps modernes\" reste-t-il globalement muet (à l'exception de quelques phrases informatives dans l'usine qui peuvent aisément être assimilées à des bruitages, et de la section chantée en yaourt franco-italien vers la fin).  Il s'agit là du dernier \"grand\" film muet de l'histoire du cinéma et de la dernière apparition du \"Tramp\" chaplinesque à l'écran (si l'on excepte \"le Dictateur\", où cet avatar est moins explicite car doté d'un nom).  Bien entendu, l'humour visuel et le rythme frénétique propres au cinéma de Chaplin sont présents tout au long du film et, dans sa seconde partie, \"Les temps modernes\" s'impose d'ailleurs plutôt comme un fable humaniste, qui prône avec une certaine poésie la symbiose de l'amour et de la liberté comme garants du bonheur et de l'épanouissement.  Mais c'est avant tout la première partie du film qui sera restée dans l'histoire, grâce à sa description féroce d'un monde du travail brutal et déshumanisé, où l'homme s'efface derrière la machine et les exigences de rentabilité.  Mais, qu'il s'agisse de cette section militante ou de cette seconde moitié plus portée sur les péripéties burlesques et la tendresse, \"Les temps modernes\" est surtout une preuve, parmi les plus évidentes qui soient, du génie de la mise en scène qu'était Chaplin, capable de faire passer, sans dialogues mais avec un science de la gestuelle sans équivalent, des émotions et des messages plus complexes que dans bien des réalisations d'aujourd'hui.",

He is eventually fired for driving everyone nuts and attempts to find work elsewhere. He does so as an advertiser on the streets, but inadvertently causes a riot and loses his job. Soon after, Chaplin gets into further trouble for being sought out as a thief of a loaf of bread and for some reason, takes the blame even though he doesn't take it, but the charges are eventually dropped thanks to a lovely dame (Paulette Goddard). The two pair up and cause even more chaos for the town and themselves, even despite the fact they are both falling deeply in love with one another. \"Modern Times\" still retains its magic after seven-and-a-half decades after the initial release, with Chaplin shining thanks to his signature walk and slapstick comedy. The integration of some sound, with none that is from Chaplin himself, also adds to fineness of this movie.",

After watching a second time, I've realized it's up there with Chaplin's greatest work. It may not be as consistently funny as his other work, but the film never gets boring and still manages to be visually arresting, even it it's downtime (which is still on a high). And there are still some of Chaplin's funniest and most brilliant gags ever here, like the nervous breakdown scene, and the magnificent nonsense song and dance. It's hard not to appreciate the genius satire and the underlying themes within that provide the viewer with a truly invigorating experience. One also can't help but be appreciative of Chaplin's daring in releasing this \"silent-talkie\" in the midst of the sky-rocketing popularity of the talkies. Respect.\r\n\r\nModern Times is definitely one of Chaplin's masterfully crafted masterpieces, it's a telling story with gripping storytelling, hilarious sight gags and ingenious satire, and an uplifting experience that will leave you smiling a mile-wide grin like an idiot. And not care who sees. Well, maybe a little. No, you won't care. Well, I guess it depends on how much you actually care about what other people think. I have trouble with that. It's hard to pretend like you don't care what other people think, because you just want to be yourself and- wait. Sorry, I digress. It's a wonderful movie. That's all.",

He meets a young woman who, like him, is out of work and homeless. Together they embark on an enjoyable and funny adventure. It really is just a whole load of fun, and there are so many iconic scenes. Chaplin allows the Tramp character to speak in one scene (or sing, more precisely) for the first time, but in nonsensical gibberish, so as to not change the image of the character.

Some parts I really liked was when he was scatting and the part when he set free the unfinished boat in to the ocean. The ending scene was also a good way to end the film. The two of them walking on the road to go find work and a better life. There's one thing I didn't understand.
