But when a vile young criminal calling himself the Joker (Heath Ledger) suddenly throws the town into chaos, the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and vigilantism.",

Dark, sinister...throughout the entirety of it you really aren't sure if Batman will prevail, and that puts you on the edge of your seat. It's downright brutal at times, but not with gratuitous gore or anything like that, but because of the psychology of it. Heath Ledger's version of the Joker is the best ever. Period. Rarely have things felt so hopeless in a movie. Joker is the perfect villain to Batman because he has nothing to lose and a great desire for theatrics. Brilliant.",

Heath Ledger's Joker is one of, if not the best by far; which unfortunately became the death of him. This movie is a very more \"realistic\" approach to the Batman franchise, seeming like most of it if not all could happen in real life. It is definitely different compared to other Batman movies or portrayals, but all the worthwhile. Heath Ledger's Joker is also different with a more serious yet dark humored Joker. It plays more to Joker being a realistic, psychopathic, madman with some dark humor to top it off. Much unlike the typical happy go lucky, comical Joker we see in most portrayals. Anyway definitely a must watch, recommend highly.",

Director Christopher Nolan's vision for the Batman franchise is dark, gritty, and deeply psychological, with stunning visuals, incredible performances, and a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.\n\nAt the center of the movie is the iconic character of Batman, played with brooding intensity by Christian Bale. This version of the character is deeply conflicted, haunted by his past and driven by a desire to rid Gotham City of its criminal underworld. Bale's performance is both nuanced and powerful, making the character feel both relatable and larger-than-life.\n\nBut what really makes \"The Dark Knight\" stand out is the performance of the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. This portrayal of the infamous villain is chilling, unpredictable, and utterly captivating. Ledger's performance is one of the greatest in cinematic history, and his interpretation of the character is a true tour de force.\n\nThe story of the movie is complex and multi-layered, with themes of chaos, order, and morality woven throughout. The action sequences are breathtaking, with Nolan's masterful direction creating a sense of tension and excitement that few other movies can match.\n\nThe cinematography and visual effects in \"The Dark Knight\" are also top-notch, creating a visually stunning and immersive world that feels both realistic and fantastical.\n\nIt's a thrilling, thought-provoking, and unforgettable cinematic experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll.

While its runtime is formidable for the genre, there isn't any fat on this film, instead filling its two and a half hour time with an intriguing and well-crafted story that adds depth to characters that are already admirably acted. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Nestor Carbonell, and somehow the list goes on. It's an impressive array of talent, especially given the superhero element, but director Christopher Nolan is always able to pull actors of this caliber due to his own prowess and, like his other projects, it elevates his final product immensely. At its core, The Dark Knight is a compelling and incredibly watchable action film, but it has interesting points to be made about how we perceive heroes and villains as bystanders. While the film doesn't delve too deeply into this element, it is always present and ramps up as the film concludes. It might have been nice to see some more of that introspection, but there was too little time on the clock when the crime drama is this good. Following the events of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight sees DA Harvey Dent (Eckhart) finally begin to clean up the mean streets of Gotham. When a mob accountant with damaging information is caught up in the city's cleaning effort, the criminal underbelly of Gotham turns to the mysterious Joker (Ledger) to eliminate him. What results is a thrilling chase through Gotham as Batman (Bale) is forced to play The Joker's game in order to save the city. The plot is so well-paced and engaging that it's easy to forget that The Dark Knight is a superhero movie at times. The set pieces are stunning and the action is so chockfull and well choreographed that I thought I was watching the concluding scene at only the 90-minute mark. In reality the film was just barely halfway done, a realization that was, itself, incredibly exciting at the time. Overall The Dark Knight is an exhilarating ride that makes excellent use of its runtime by filling the screen with tremendous performances and epic, unforgettable scenes. It holds up nicely after fifteen years and is likely still the best superhero movie of our time.",

La pel\u00edcula tiene un tono m\u00e1s sombr\u00edo que en la anterior y logra replicar la visi\u00f3n oscura del material original. Christian Bale logra interpretar un excelente Batman con un tono m\u00e1s sombr\u00edo, en especial por la voz que le da. Heath Ledger se despide de la gran pantalla y del mundo terrenal dejando un Joker bastante siniestro. Su mejor interpretaci\u00f3n final que personifica a un villano psic\u00f3tico y bastante t\u00e9trico. La pel\u00edcula est\u00e1 muy bien dirigida, escrita y producida. La banda sonora de Hans Zimmer tambi\u00e9n sube de nivel en esta pel\u00edcula con su mezcla de ambiente oscuro y siniestro con un tono \u00e9pico. The Dark Knight es sin duda otra de las mejores pel\u00edculas de Batman y la mejor de esta trilog\u00eda. Mi calificaci\u00f3n final para esta pel\u00edcula es un 10/10.",

The psychotic Joker pushes Batman to the fringes by not only going after innocent civilians but those closest to the capped crusader. An enticing and well balanced storyline keeps the audience wondering at what cost is Batman willing to endure his dilemma to put an end to his enemies? An excellent cast, writing and directing along with special effects make this one of the best superhero movies of all time!!!",

I have always been a fan of Batman and this is probably the best Batman movie and will be the best for years to come. What I love about this movie is how this would be the most likely Batman Story that would happen, like this is a more ground to earth based Batman Story, (It's more based on reality). The storyline is beautiful, Gotham is getting used to Batman being a protector but some people still have issues with him. With a new villain coming at large (The Joker) here to terrorize Gotham but also to test Batman and make him take of his mask and reveal himself. The way the Joker does this by making Gotham fall into chaos is magnificent, Killing high ranking officials, destroying parts of Gotham, making Harvey Dent go mad, making Batman make the hardest choices, that is the Joker I love to see. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was just perfect, may he rest in peace knowing that this was his best performance ever. \n\nThe action in this film is mind-blowing, all the explosions, the fights, everything was amazing, leading up to the final fight between Batman and the Joker, it was breath taking. The execution of the film was absolutely perfect, like that was the only way that film could've ended to make it that successful. I love how some people see this movie as a Batman story while others see it as a Joker Story or a Gotham story, but I agree with all 3 opinions. This movie just had such an impact on my life and is my favorite film of all time, I don't think anything will beat this film. Guys if you haven't seen this film, go and watch it right now, it is the greatest films of all time.",

It seems like Batman is getting the hang of things, he's still fighting the mob and even trying to discourage copycats. \n\nThere is a new villain in Gotham though in an oscar-winning performance by Heath Ledger, as the diabolical madman The Joker. We don't find out much more about who The Joker is accept his goal is to create chaos, and in The Dark Knight he sure does that, probably being Batman's biggest test ever in the Nolan series.\n\nThe Dark Knight isn't just the best Batman movie or comic book movie ever, but a truly great film in cinema period.\nhttp://themoviepad.com",

And lastly Christian Bale to me is the definitive Bruce Wayne just like Robert Pattinson to me is the definitive Batman Bale made me actually be interested in Batman when he isn't wearing the suit which was surprising.

            "content": "The film which nails everything. The film which turned the genre on its head and delivered an epic crime thriller. The film which redefined the era and left a lasting impact on not just the genre, but the industry itself. There's nothing else I could add to the conversation, but I'm going to try.\n\nChristopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\" transcends cinema of its era. Somehow building upon the success of the great reset that was \"Batman Begins\", it also manages to stand on its own as the pinnacle of film in its era. \n\nIt's not simply the Caped Crusader against his greatest foe, it presents them as mirror images of each other, putting the hero in a moral dilemma as he tries to save his city from further descent into chaos. This is elevated by perfect casting and performances. Cristian Bale builds upon his performance in the predecessor, both as Bruce Wayne and his crime-fighting alter ego. He delivers with passion, charm and likeability. Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon is even better and shows it in his shared sense for what is good with Bruce. Michael Caine continued to prove he was the ideal Alfred, with his foster father relationship with our protagonist. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, and is solid in the role. Lucius Fox is played well by Morgan Freeman. Aaron Eckhart gives a career best performance as Gotham's White Knight, Harvey Dent who later becomes Two-Face, embodying the theme of moral duality. The late, great Heath Ledger gives one the best performances of all-time as Gotham's prince of crime, The Joker. He serves as a mirror image of Batman, seeking to plummet Gotham to its inevitable fate, taking down the hero in the process. He doesn't need to kill him, just to go against his own moral code, believing everyone is corruptible, even Gotham's symbol of justice.\n\nThe score by Hans Zimmer & James Newton Howard also helps to engross the viewer into the experience. The visuals are also pretty clean, most of the action scenes executed with practical effects using minimal CGI. To think they actually blew up a factory!\n\n\nThe writing is also on point. As I alluded to earlier, the Nolans penned a compelling story which touches on duality, Batman as the titular character seeks to be replaced by a \"White Knight\", a conspicuous embodiment of hope and change. Joker wants to plunge the city into chaos. Harvey Dent and later Two-Face becomes the symbol of this duality. Order and chaos is the duality. This is what Joker seeks to unleash upon the citizens of Gotham. \"Take away human beings' physical comforts and safety, they will turn into animals.\" All of his acts are calculated and are done to prove a point. Dent is a symbol of order by idealism, something for people to believe in, a \"White Knight\". Batman is presented as symbol of a necessary, invisible constant to ensure order is maintained, that nobody sees, a \"Dark Knight\". I have to give props for introducing us to the world of these films in the first film and then hitting us with this film second. The plot and character developments in these films are excellent.\n\nOverall, \"The Dark Knight\" is a film which is very dear to me. It's a film I never get bored or tired of watching or talking about. A film which never ceases to entertain or surprise me. It took its premise and world seriously, using a fictional world to share real world truths which resonate with us. It stands toe-to-toe with not only the best sequels or comic book films but the best films of all-time, period. I can't think of anything I don't love about it. I'm genuinely in awe of this film.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan's grim and dazzling sequel to his 2005 franchise reboot 'Batman Begins' is terrific entertainment. He brings us a hyper-realistic superhero movie with film noir shadings, getting at the roots of the Batman legend. His cerebral spin on the Caped Crusader raises the bar on comic-book movies and cinematic summer spectacles. This is considerably better than 'Begins'. The fights are more coherent, the drama more gripping and effecting, and the scope more epic. The cast is an embarrassment of great actors--Christian Bale is superb, Aaron Eckhart is charismatic and savage, Maggie Gyllenhaal shows why Katie Holmes was miscast in the first film, Gary Oldman is splendidly empathetic, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman prove how they earned their Oscars. Pros like Eric Roberts, Anthony Michael Hall, and William Fitchner do service to chewy bit parts. But Heath Ledger reminds us of that old Hitchcock saying \"Good villains make good movies.\" And The Joker, as envisioned by director Nolan and brother Jonathan (they co-wrote it together) and brought to vivid life by Ledger's psychotic, meticulous, delicious performance, is a GREAT villain. He's one of the most memorable bad guys of the decade, a genuine mystery of a sadistic madman. Ledger received a posthumous Oscar for his work here, and rightly so. This genius turn will live on in movie-going memory for years to come. The film is also a triumph of style, mounted with a superior technical quality. Wally Pfister's cinematography emphasizes the shadows, the harsh sunlight, and the eeriness of the night. His use of IMAX cameras for big action sequences is brilliantly thrilling. The editing is crisp (if choppy at brief moments), the effects and stunts are awesome, and the script gives us human characters we come to care about. Nolan's Batman story gets at the essence of film noir, which is there are no more heroes. By the end of this adventure the moral foundation of the Batman mythology has been thoroughly shaken, and we are compelled to see where Nolan and Bale take this character next. But for now we have arguably the best superhero/comic-book movie ever made, and one of the best films of 2008",

Possibly the best comic book superhero movie ever, TDK is gritty, violent, emotional, witty, heartbreaking, and thrilling. Christian Bale does a great job in the title role, but the show-stealer was Heath Ledger's Joker, which won a posthumous Oscar. Creepy and sadistic, Ledger brings the character to life in such a lively and convincing way that Ledger is well worthy of the awards he has won. Aaron Ekhart also knocks it out of the park as Harvey Dent/Two Face, and returning characters like Michale Cain's Alfred and Gary Oldman's Gordon liven the story. The plot is complex, exciting, and perfectly crafted. The characters are well-written, and it delivers some of the best scenes and stunts in movie history. And while plot conveniences abound, and some of the characters stray far from their comic-book origins, The Dark Knight is the definitive Batman movie.",

The story was tightly crafted, with no detail going unnoticed, is packed with several emotional punches throughout due to its willingness to take risks. The actors did fantastically in their roles, most notably Ledger as the Joker, though I felt everyone had their time to shine no matter how insignificant their character might have felt. The score is fitting and tense, and the action sequences are used sparingly but are done to the absolute fullest. The props and stunts were also fantastically done, and I think Nolan really shows his unique directing style in this film. The final message of the movie was though-provoking, and the entire film feels grounded and realistic. Overall, a phenomenal piece of art in otherwise stale and copy-pasted superhero genre. A must-watch at least once.",

            "content": "Really an excellent film - the somewhat greyscale, staid aesthetic of Christopher Nolan never forgets how a great story also needs character, issues, drive to keep viewers connected. Classic, and unbeatable material from a film that it's creators described as a film that wasn't going to feel first-and-foremost like an exercise in setpieces and fake CGI explosions and fantasy powers for genre fans. This film would stand perfectly well without fantasy characters, and while the film is fun, it's also a blockbuster level film that feels like a legit piece of earnest drama also. \n\nWhile there are (dangerous) stunts and unnerving action sequences in the movie, Nolan's ethos is more in line with the hardboiled crime/thriller genre - story focuses on issue of Batman defending a city with hypocritical, flawed leadership, threat of terrorism. Bruce Wayne's backstory was fully explored in the previous set-up piece \"Batman Begins\", so no \"personal low-point\" clich\u00e9 scenes appear before the Hero finally Saves the Day - even the morality of saving the day becomes somewhat ambiguous in this well cast film. My only criticism is it's edited slightly too fast. \n\nAll three are excellent films but the last two feel bigger and more worldly - Nolan's Batman Begins is somewhat setbound, the second is paced so fast you may miss a few story connections and the third is excellent also but lingers in a way that doesn't quite feel bloated, but could use slightly tighter pacing in places. The Dark Knight is arguably the greatest film of it's type in an overcrowded marketplace.",

            "content": "Gotham City's crime is kept under control by billionaire-by-day, cape crusader, Bruce Wayne. As a masked vigilante, he is well feared and respected. But when an aimless villain known as the Joker begins to terrorize the town, Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent assist Batman in capturing him. The team soon learns that every one of their choices are critical in turning them into heroes or villains.\n\nWith a cast as equally talented as it is star-studded, the film boasts a diversely elegant cast from the likes of acclaimed method actor, Christian Bale, to Hollywood veteran, Morgan Freeman.\n\nThe spine-chilling soundtrack complements the mystery and the darkness that constitutes the film's edginess.\n\nThe elaborate criminality, stunning visuals, effects, and explosions gave \"The Dark Knight\" a resonant neo-noir quality. \n\nThe pacing is right on-target for a film that must deliver as much mystery as cutthroat action and adventure. Editor Lee Smith does an impeccable job of not letting the slower scenes feel like they're dragging, then sandwiching them in between scenes of thrill and breakneck action. I enjoyed that the wall-to-wall action was fueled by suspense. There were few cuts in massive stunt scenes which provided realism and authenticity to the violence.\n\nChristian Bale as Gotham City's masked vigilante was dramatic, suave, stealthy, and well \u2014 dark! I admire that Batman steps back to question his own morals. He has to make decisions that nobody wants to make \u2014 heroic decisions that make it impossible to please everyone at the end of the day. Batman begins to realize that his role as the Caped Crusader of his villain-laden city could be one that is critical in good and bad ways. \n\nHeath Ledger's performance as Joker is brilliantly unmatched and befittingly abstruse, but that goes without saying. I love the fact that Joker's backstory here is constantly contradicted, giving his character an even more mysterious atmosphere. The audience understands clearly that this man just wants to watch the world burn and ask questions after. The fact that he has no apparent rhyme or reason builds anarchic suspense within the film and humor within the character.\n\nAaron Eckhart's Two-Face had a great backstory here. The parallels between fighting for justice with love and fighting justice for loss contribute to a profound plot twist. In Two-Faces case, he turned to evil. In Bruce Wayne's case, good was chosen. This made the slight rivalry between the two characters over Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) that much more interesting, and solidified the two as perfect foes in the second act.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed \"The Dark Knight\" because it is unlike any superhero film around. By being so deep-rooted in the character's intentions and morals, we end up with what feels like a film about regular people who are taken to wild extremes by means of emotion and sacrifice. The stakes here are tremendously thrilling, full of adventure, meaningful and permanent. Great movie!\n\n91%!",

Maybe at that time, I didn't understand what is this movie was all about. But now, when I watch the movie again. All I got to say is. \"The Dark Knight\" is the best blockbuster movie and has the most accuracy from a comic book of all time. It has good scriptwriting and has a lot of twists that we can't find in hero movies nowadays. The score on this film is superb. This film has a depth meaning about what being a genuine superhero looks likes. It will give you a lot of feelings when you watch it. Also, this movie will play with your feelings about who you will choose to be safe. I mean, this is a tough decision for someone to have. Even you are a hero. And you want to save both of them. Also, the movie will represent how someone will become a villain even he is a man who believes in law and justice. It will be questioning you that. Is everything that we believe in all the time is correct or not? And if it's true. Will any consequences come after this? \nFor the casts, Christian Bale and Michael Cane are still doing a great job as Batman and Alfred since the last movie is Batman Begins. But this time. I have to give a big round of applause to Heath Ledger. His performance in this movie is memorable for everyone when he plays as a Joker. The best villain from a comic. It seems like we can see a Joker inside of him. He's nailed on his role. But sadly, this is the last movie he played before he died, maybe if he's still here. We might see him on a big screen again. About the production, I have to say that the action scenes in this movie look so great. The visual is so stunning. The fight and car chase scenes are looking great without CGI. I recommend everyone to watch this film. It will give you an experience!!!",

Whether it's Heath Ledger\u2018s Oscar winning performance, Aaron Eckhart performance, Gary Oldman\u2018s performance, the undervalued performance of Christian Bale, hell, even the upgrade of Maggie Gyllenhaal over Katie Holmes.  I went into this much anticipated sequel, with an ending to the previous installment, promising a new incarnation of the joker, with extreme excitement and expectations.  I thought it would end up being one of the best comic book movies ever, just like Batman Begins. Instead?  Not only were my expectations met, they were FAR exceeded.  We ended up with literally one of the greatest movies of all time.  It was obvious from the first scene of the movie, to the last.  The feeling of euphoria leaving the theater.  You just knew you had witnessed an instant cinematic classic. I immediately went into the next possible showing.  Never in my life have I been inspired to do that.  A film that touched on issues like the war on terror, surveillance state, and other hot button topics but with the entertaining superficiality of Batman mythology, and the villains that inhabit his world.  Can't express more how great this film is, even now almost 15 years later.  It's still not only the greatest Batman film, it's quite easily the best comic book movie of all time.  And that's saying something, there was a ton of them by the time it released, and there's been an infinite number more since.  TDK is the GOAT, to this day.",

            "content": "I'll be brief: yes, it's like everyone says. The second part of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is a milestone for the superhero genre in many ways. Of course, over the years, voices have piled up that the film is overrated. A word that is used far too inflationary in the film world. And yes, presumably in times of modern superhero films by Marvel and co, The Dark Knight reveals many previously uncertain weaknesses. However, it remains to be said that the genre, which was not very popular at the time, opened up new dimensions for the box office.\n\nWith over just over one billion US dollars, the 2008 film was the first superhero flick ever to break through that barrier. Since then, there have often been several films of this genre every year that have managed to do so. Films that are nowhere near as revolutionary and significant. The Dark Knight has left its mark not only in terms of box-office takings. It did not introduce a new villain from the comics in the form of the Joker, who had already been seen in previous films. But it was written and portrayed in such a way that people are still talking about it 14 years later. Heath Ledger's breakthrough performance has been talked about enough. To disappear into a role is one thing. How Ledger manages to reinterpret this already established villain and have such an impact on the central plot is truly masterful. Many think that The Dark Knight is only hyped because of Ledger's performance. Sure, that aspect has a huge part to play, but alongside the anarchic troublemaker, we have another memorable character with the introduction of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). In several ways Batman's great rival, his development is both stirring and heartbreaking. For never would one initially believe that Dent's plotline would take such a course in the third act. The paeans to these two iconic figures almost make it seem as if our protagonist is more of a follower under the mask. But rather, Batman is the ideal complement to the crazed Joker, who is the exact opposite of the Caped Crusader. Anarchy meets justice - a combination that throws Gotham into an almost impossible-to-manage chaos. Well-established characters around Alfred, Lucius, Rachel and the new police chief Jim Gordon also get more depth and their special moments in the long running time.\n\nBut it is not only the brilliantly realised characters that make The Dark Knight the masterpiece of its genre. While Batman Begins very leisurely builds up the transformation of Bruce Wayne into Batman, this time Nolan delivers an action firework from second one. The film very rarely settles down and when it does, it knows how to focus on the element that interests us: The characters. This time around, Nolan leaves out the darkness that hovers around Gotham and doesn't really rely on settings. For over two and a half hours, we get to see an exchange of blows between good and evil - carried by a wonderful Hans Zimmer score.",

Christian Bale is a very likeable Batman/Bruce, however I thought his rendition of Batman's voice was a bit odd.  Gary Oldman and Ledger lead the movie in performances.  Eric Roberts dialogue was cartoonish, I am not sure if he got it from the script or if he was allowed to improvise.  This was the film that introduced me to an underrated David Dastmalchian.  His performance in this was brief but powerful and I went on to be impressed by his performances in Blade Runner 2049 and The Suicide Squad.  Both movies where he was buried down in the credits.  I think he will go on to give us some stellar performances in the future.  This film was definitely the best of the trilogy.",

This film is visually gorgeous, with an incredible score, and excellent dialogue with memorable characters. I wish we could've gotten more development on Maggie Gyllenhaal's likable Rachel, as the only notable female character, or Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox\u2014who is lovable in any role he's in.\n\nI will say though\u2014as someone wholly unfamiliar with the Batman comics\u2014this movie felt quite a bit longer than it needed to be. It lost quite a bit of steam for me around 2/3 of the way through and some of the action sequences felt like \"hmm. Feels like we've seen this before\" and the secondary vigilante villain emerging, while intriguing on paper, didn't feel completely justified either in the actor's performance or the writing, I'm not completely sure.

The titular protagonist exhibits enough screen time of brains and brawn, but it is Ledger's uncanny portrayal of the Joker that steals the show as he constantly pushes the hero to his limits, raising the stakes in a battle between order versus chaos. Even though the fight choreography is arguably mediocre, I appreciate the more realistic direction intended as a side note.

The acting brings you right into the minds of the characters and at times makes you question their decisions while also making you understand why they believe what they do. The movie is motivated by relevant experience as we have all felt at an all time low and this is what drives the four main characters to their actions. Joker believes that the only thing fair in the world is anarchy so he chases that, Harvey Dent chooses to trust everything to chance, and Lt Gordan struggles with corruption in the police department. Batman struggles with all these things trying to protect the city while also maintaining his morals of not killing even when someone has caused so many deaths. The movie also brings into question dignity of the human person in a scene where the Joker places two bombs on two boats and puts a group of normal citizens on one and prisoners on the other. The citizens are arguing with each other about whether or not to blow up the other boat, and at one point someone says, \" they are animals over there they have made their choices\" this is not seen as a kind statement in the movie. Throughout the debate the question of the prisoner's dignity is pulled into question and ultimately the citizens decide that they are just as himan as they are. The attitude awareness is very negative as it explores what happens to humanity when it hits its lowest point. While the movie wasn't necessarily inspiring the whole time, near the end when Lt Gordon gives his monlouge to his son about what a hero is one can only feel inspired as Batman rides off into the darkness. Inspired by the sacrifice he makes so that the city might have a hero, even if it isn't him. While the movie does maintain a lot of violence and anger I think that it also exploresa lot of the philosophies that somehow make our world a hard place to live, it also sheds these in a negative light and shows the negative logic trails these ideologies can have when followed as embodied by the Joker and Two-face which i think give the movie balance",

The theme in The Dark Knight is power. In The Dark Knight Batman realizes that he's brought a great quantity of justice to Gotham, but he has more work to do once the Joker brings more corruption and destruction to Gotham. \n\t The Dark Knight makes us very invested in its characters through their power.   They see power in different ways. Bruce Wayne has power in an abundance of wealth. He uses it to help his friends such as when he uses it to help his friend Harvey Dent be voted district attorney of Gotham by throwing him a fundraiser.  He relies on science with his wealth to become Batman and with the help of Lucius Fox. Batman believes power is having the world be organized and controlling with rules. The Joker has power in which he's manipulative when he makes the police chief James Gordon not realize that he wants him to arrest him. The Joker also believes that power means having all the freedom you want with living in a world without rules or laws in, other words The Joker believes everyone should literally be able to do whatever they want. The film makes you want to be more invested with the characters after it ends. It makes you wonder if their meaning of power has even more to it after the film ends, or if their meaning is everlasting and there's no end to it.  \n\tThe Dark Knight's action is exciting. One example would be when Lucius Fox Batman's technology expert guides him in a building where the Joker is causing mayhem, or another example would be when Batman shoots mines on windows and makes the windows explode. Batman driving his bat pod or bat motorcycle around Gotham is authentically exciting action.\n\tThe Dark Knight has a unique and exciting script that creates plenty of nostalgia with enabling you to remember Batman Begins with many nods to it.",

            "content": "I'm not personally hugely into DC characters or movies that are made about those characters, but I think that The Dark Knight may be the best comic book film I've ever seen. This movie is dark, gloomy, unbelievably acted and brilliant in writing, direction and content. Christian Bale is by far the best Batman we've seen to date, and Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger give probably the best performances of their careers. From start to finish, Dark Knight is a thrilling crime movie that exemplifies the vigilante problem via the relationship that Batman has with Commissioner Gordon and the rest of Gotham's crime-fighting police squad, and it never lets you go. This is an anxiety building movie that keeps you constantly wondering and worried about what's going to happen next and how the movie is going to surprise you and subvert expectations. This is a Christopher Nolan movie that is smart and deep without getting too complicated and hard to follow the way some of his other films can be at times. Despite how much is going on in it, Dark Knight is a very refined movie with a clear focus and flows very smoothly despite how nerve-racking it is for both the characters and viewers. But the absolute highlight of this film is Heath Ledger's Joker. For a villain we've don't get a backstory for and know very little about in the movie, the Joker is a scary, complex, and intimidating villain who gives Wilson Fisk a run for his money. From the first time we see his face until his fate at the end of the movie, the Joker is a just as gripping as the movie is and is a villain who knows how to influence, mess with and terrify people. He is an antagonist who wants to fill people with fear and cause their society to do a 180 degree flip on itself and does so through very engaging and unique means you don't see coming and wouldn't think of to see in a comic book movie. Heath Ledger's performance, as I mentioned earlier, is mind-blowing; he is probably the best antagonist we've seen in any DC movie ever and I'm unsure if any villain could top him. This movie is dark enough and has complex enough themes that I'd even say this isn't a movie for kids; you need to be a little older and more mature to truly understand and appreciate what's going on in this movie. The Dark Knight is an absolutely must-see for DC fans and comic book fans in general as Marvel fans will find a lot to appreciate about this movie too.",

Christian Bale is arguably the best Batman to grace our screens, Heath Ledger is perhaps the best villain to grace our screens, the whole film is packed full of amazing performances. The suspense is unreal, its' edge-of-your-seat stuff and it's amazing. The opening scene in this film is fantastic, the ending, when you realize that The Joker won, is great for setting up the next film and everything in between is great to.

The Dark Knight offers audiences the greatest comic book film that has ever been made. With riveting performances from Christian Bale, Anthony Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhall, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and of course, the Academy Award Winning performance of Heath Ledger, TDK dives you into the dark and cold world of Gotham. Nolan creates a Gotham that looks like its out of a page from Michael Mann's production notes. The city plays almost like a character to the dedicated vigilante of Batman. Unlike previous iterations, the Batman faces foes in this film that more than just evil. The Joker is literally a prankster anarchist, with no regards for whatever action they make. Two-Face is a fallen antihero who falls down the broken path as he loses the love of his life and also sees how corruption rots the city from within.  Then there are the gangsters who run amuck in the city, and this all is covered so expertly by Nolan throughout the film. The way he makes a superhero feel real, and also make it seem believable is astonishing. The Dark Knight was the first time watching a super hero movie where I felt, the explanations and the treatment made it real world. Its one of the reasons why it works so so well! And the political undertones and commentary are just perfect, commenting on real life situations and using the famous DC characters to showcase and explain the rights and wrongs of these thought processes. All in all, a legendary film that all should watch, regardless if you're a super hero film lover or not.",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite movies ever made. I love The Dark Knight. One of the best things Nolan did for this movie happened in Batman Begins and he saved the most iconic Batman villain not for the first film, not for his introduction but for the next film. He let you get into that world, he made you invested in the characters in Gotham and everything that he was creating and now you're invested in it let's bring out the big guns , Heath Ledger knock this right out of the park. To this day that was one of the best performances ever given by an actor. What is so great about the Joker is he understands the morals of Batman, he knows that Batman doesn't want to kill and he keeps setting up all these different things that's going to cause Batman to want to do that or have to do that to get out of the situations,  he creates moral dilemmas for people and for Batman in this movie and that's why he's such a good villain because he finds the weaknesses of each person that he wants to attack in some way and he exploits them. Another thing that's so great about the Joker in this movie is the fact that he actually makes sense, he's doing horrible things but you can understand why he's doing that. He's not just some mindless lunatic maniac just out there doing whatever he wants, he understands some of the things that is wrong with society and he's trying to in a very bad way fix that. The writing is just flawless, it's fantastic and that's why he is the perfect villain for Batman ,this movie illustrates so well. One of the best scenes in this movie the interrogation scene that is some of the best confrontational dialogue ever put to film. It even illustrates my point even more as the Batman is trying to prove that what the Joker is doing is wrong and it is wrong what he's doing , the way he's going about doing it, the Joker is able to give completely logical reasons as to why he's doing what he's doing  and they make sense, they both make sense, you can actually watch The Dark Knight and understand exactly where each character is coming from. This movie is close to perfect as movies can get, I adore The Dark Knight is such an excellent movie, everything from the visuals to the music Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard score. Christian Bale's Batman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Aaron Eckhart, Heath Ledger. Everyone in this movie is flawless. This is an excellent film and I love it.",

Heath Ledger is stunningly believable as the Joker, landing dead center on the fine line between the Joker's dark hilariousness and utter psychopathy. Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent is spot-on, as the extremely charismatic D.A. who becomes a psychopathic spree killer. The Dark Knight may just be my favorite superhero film, and mind you, I've seen quite a few superhero films.",

            "content": "I know it sounds a bit too clich\u00e9 when someone says this, but this is undoubtedly one of, if not the best superhero movie ever created! It excels in every field it touches - The visual effects are done perfectly, the acting is absolutely Oscar worthy, the multiple storylines that don't seem too complex in spite of being told at the same time and in spite of being just one movie of a trilogy it managed to win the hearts of everyone who saw it.\nThe story picks up very well from where Batman Begins ended. The post credit scene in that movie had shown Joker, and I can very well imagine how excited the audience must have been seeing it. The Batman and Joker duo is used to describe the social aspects of the society, and explain how people might behave if they are left unhinged. A hero who has his moral codes and a lot to lose, compared to a villain without any moral codes and nothing to lose yet have so much in common than what meets the normal eye. Ultimately both are seen as freaks who must be eliminated by the law.\nLet's talk about the characters, starting from Christian Bale's Batman. His voice sounds horrible as Batman. Nowadays many people have begun criticising it, but they don't realise that if a real Batman has to change his voice, he only has two ways of doing it - either using a voice modulator like Ben Affleck's Batman does, or deal with trying to sound different, which isn't easy when he has to breathe heavily because of how hard he works. It's just fun to see the caped crusader doing something on the screen.\nNext let's address Michael Caine's Alfred. He's a good representation of Alfred. Just by looking at him you get the feeling of both a butler and a guardian, something we know Alfred to be. And it can be seen very nicely when he dresses Bruce's wounds or talks to him about his crimefighting.\nThen we have Aaron Eckhart's Two Face. Unlike the previous iteration that was seen in Batman Forever, this one seems a lot more serious. He went through a hefty character development, from the patriotic white Knight of Gotham, Harvey Dent, to the deranged psychopath who is ready to cross all limits if he wants to have his revenge.\nJim Gordon is also a much, much better iteration from what we had seen in the 1989 Batman. He actually looks like someone who is invested in his job and can contact Batman whenever he needs help. He is the kind of Gordon I imagine when I think of the animated movies. When someone mentions Jim Gordon, this is the one who comes to my mind.\nAnd finally the elephant in the room, the show stealer - Heath Ledger's Joker. Just like Two Face, Joker here has also gone through a complete makeover from what he was portrayed as in the previous movie that came in 1989. It's kinda sad that Heath Ledger never got to know how famous he has become, but his legacy shall forever live in the DC universe.\nThe Dark Knight is one movie I often come back to just to remember these kinds of superhero movies are also possible. Every DC character should be given such movies where their character is shown to develop as time moves on. This fire should not die out.",

You can tell with Batman '89 they had fun making it and it's transmitted in the watching experience. And what's with Batman sounding like a death metal singer and Joker always smacking his lips. It's not more dramatic, it's dumb and annoying. The soundtrack is banal, always playing and even masks the dialogue in certain parts. The action scenes just kind of happen, nothing very creative. After 2 hours in, I just wanted it to end. It's strange, because this had all the makings of a great film, but something in the way it was executed.",

I'm just your average man who loves movies with a good plot, great character development, and a cinematic experience that calls for all six senses to be entangled into the film. The Dark Knight Rises does all of these things.\n     This movie is my favorite movie of all time. How in the world could a superhero comic movie be one of the best movies in my opinion? Because it's not a superhero movie. It's a film about loss, growing from pain, and going into the deepest parts of yourself to see that sometimes you are the bad guy. You see, The Joker and Batman need each other. There isn't one without the other. Bruce Wayne tries to deny it, but Joker loves to bring this idea up. \n     The Dark Knight is great because of The Joker. Heath Ledger is the greatest part of this film. He sells it. I think he's one of the greatest villains of all time. He embodies everything The Joker is and then some through his chilling monologues and constant tempting to push Batman beyond his morals (like his no killing policy). He sees past the harden exterior of Batman and finds Bruce: The scared kid that ultimately wants revenge for his parents' death.\n     Can't recommend this movie enough.",

            "content": "When I watched the Dark Knight for the first time I was enamored by everything the movie had to offer. From the stellar performances to the excellent writing, everything was created with careful planning and execution. So that's why I want to start the review by saying that this movie is a GOOD movie. I just so happen to not like it as much anymore.\n\n*Spoilers*\n\nThis movie thrives on confusing and surprising the audience with every chance it gets, which is in my opinion this movie's greatest strength, unpredictability. Just think about it, Heath Ledger as the Joker is the perfect villain because when you look at him, you believe that he is an \"Agent of Chaos\" as he claims himself to be. And the definition for chaos is \"behavior so unpredictable as to appear at random.\" So, I will dissect the first scene quickly so I can show you how Christopher Nolan uses unpredictability to his advantage. \n\nThe scene opens up with five men going to rob a bank, two entering the bank from the roof, while three enter from the ground level. They all have their own job to do and like the men entering on the ground level say, this heist was really well planned. They mention in a brief conversation that they were hired by a clown who calls himself the Joker, who wears make-up like war paint to scare people. One guy on the roof called Dopey disables the bank's silent alarm while the other guy named Happy kills him as soon as the alarm is disabled. Surprise!\n\nThis is the first surprise to happen within this scene as the audience was not expecting the hitman to kill their teammates for a larger share. But the audience doesn't have time to react because as soon as the gun fires the movie cuts back to the ground level as they take hostages. A small detail to note is that instead of just tying the hostages up as a regular person would, the hitmen made them hold live grenades instead. Then one of the hitmen gets gunned down by the bank manager. And if you're surprised why the bank manager has a gun, well it's because this bank is owned by the mob! Surprise!\n\nAfter subduing the bank manager, the Happy is shown working on opening the bank vault, while a guy from the ground level named Grumpy, prepares to get the money from the vault. As soon as the vault opens, Happy is killed by Grumpy who goes to collect the money. After Grumpy brings the money up so they can make their getaway, he gets run over by the bus driver as he backs through the front door. Surprise!\n\nThe last hitman kills the bus driver, making him the last hitman in the Joker's crew. When the bank manager starts talking to the final hitman about how the Joker will kill him too and calling him a fool, the hitman takes off his clown mask. As soon as you see the caked-on make-up, the excessive eye shadow around his eyes, and his messy green hair, you make the connection that this is the Joker. The Joker had successfully killed his entire crew so he didn't have to share any of the money at all. Then the Joker decides to leave a bomb in the manager's mouth so he'll stop talking. As the bus drives away, you expect the bomb to blow up but the bomb starts spraying a puff of smoke instead. Surprise!\n\nSo, I'm just going to say that if you watched this blind, there is absolutely no way that you would be able to predict what will happen next. I was expecting just a regular bank heist but as soon as the hitman started killing their teammates for a larger share, I didn't know what to expect from that point on. And this sequence is so quickly edited that it doesn't give you a lot of time to process what is happening until the end of the heist. This scene also did a good job of foreshadowing the Joker's character while also giving him one of the best character introductions I've seen to this day. The reason it works so well is that the audience has no idea what's going on, so it engages them with the mystery. \n\nSo this movie already delivered one of the most unpredictable sequences in cinema history and it's only the first scene. I must say now that I've watched the movie three separate times in the past few years, that this scene does not disappoint even if you already know what the twists are. And that's a sign of good writing. \n\nAmong the other things that I liked a lot about the movie were the actor's performances and how the movie wrote their characters. The highlights in this movie were Heath Ledger as the Joker and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. These two actors are so good at their job that their performances are never dull for a moment. These actors did lots of work to make their performances great, and with a script like this as your source material, they had loads to work with.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the Joker. Everyone says that Heath Ledger's Joker is the best live-action Joker ever made, and I agree 100% with that statement. My favorite thing about the Joker in this movie is how he moves and how he demands that you pay attention to him. His reaction to the hospital not blowing up as he expected it to, is always hilarious to me as he looks genuinely disappointed in the outcome of the explosion. Then he is scared by the massive explosion a few seconds later. Also whenever he uses his hands when he makes a gesture or holds a knife to someone's mouth, I am at the edge of my seat watching and waiting for whatever he'll do next. Will he cut Rachel's mouth open, will he let Harvey shoot him in the face? So many questions.\n\nAnd it's not just his movement that is captivating, the way he looks, the way he talks, all of it works to create this horrific villain that we have yet to see on the big screen like this. His messy green hair and his caked-on makeup make him look like a clown, but severely deranged. Although I don't know how to go about describing his voice, I can say that his laugh is what you would expect a maniac to laugh like. \n\nThe story helps Ledger's performance a lot because this story gives him lots of opportunities to show off his acting skills. Like the scene where he is questioning a fake batman named Brian Douglas, the fact that he is holding the camera himself gives him a lot of creative liberty that allows him for a moment to take complete control over the cinematography. This just shows the massive respect Ledger and Nolan has for each other. The Joker also has many monologues within this movie where he can show his craziness on full display, especially whenever he tells the story of how he got the scars in his mouth. Plus he even gave these monologues while he was upside down. Now while Ledger's performance might be the best in the movie, my favorite performance is reserved for Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/ Two-Face.\n\nBut first I need to go over the character arc of Harvey Dent. Harvey Dent's character arc is going from Gotham's \"White Knight\" to a man who has gone mad with revenge. Dent is a guy who believes in justice first and foremost, as he believes anyone that does something he deems would be immoral, should pay. When he is simply a District Attorney, his sense of justice is simple enough, \"If somebody breaks a law, then that person has to pay for it.\" Whether it is a lifetime in prison or to pay a small fine, he believes whatever punishment the jury and the judge give that person, is fair. \n\nDent believed in the legal system very much, so he found a way to let the Gotham Police Force arrest 549 men (who were in the mob btw) by prosecuting Lau under the RICO law. The mob, now under extreme pressure of becoming broke, hires the Joker to help them escape the arrest warrants and to get their money back. This starts the Joker's entire plan, which eventually leads to the Joker kidnapping Dent and Rachel Dawes (played by Maggie Gyllenhall), and giving them both a 50/50 chance of being rescued. Only one of them could be rescued though, and to Dent's dismay, he was rescued and Rachel died.\n\nAs Dent is sitting in his hospital bed, refusing medication and skin grafts for his facial injury, I believe he is blaming everyone who had a part to play in Rachel's death. Maroni's men, the Joker, Gordon, and even himself, he won't forgive any of them and wants to bring everyone responsible to justice. Even when Gordon apologizes, Dent doesn't change his mind.\nWhen Dent sees the Joker while he is in bed, he is filled with rage to kill the man that he deems is truly responsible for Rachel's death. But the Joker lets him out on the secret that he never planned any of this to happen. In fact, that this was a spontaneous decision to create chaos, and that Dent should blame those who hired him. The reason I believe that the Joker is given a chance to live is that he is giving Dent the choice to introduce chaos in two ways, 1. Dent kills the Joker and everyone else goes off free and 2. Joker goes free and Dent kills the people who killed Rachel. \n\nThis is a good time to decipher the symbol of the coin in this movie. The coin has two sides and if you flip the coin you have a 50% chance of getting heads or tails. Dent has a coin that has two heads that he flips to give people the illusion that he is leaving things up to chance when in reality, he isn't. Maybe you could say that since the only probability is \n\"heads\" 100% of the time, it isn't fair. He gave that coin to Rachel, and when she died one of those heads became blackened by the explosion that killed Rachel.\n\nSince the coin now has a 50% chance to be heads or what I'll call tails for simplicity, he decides from here on out to give everyone who killed Rachel be given a 50/50 chance like she did that night starting with the Joker, who is set free. This brings us right back to Dent's ideals about justice which have changed drastically. He will no longer wait for a judge to decide the punishment for criminals because their punishment will never be fair. His view on justice is best described by his own words.\n\n\"The only morality in a cruel world is chance. Unbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair.\"\n\nSo why is Aaron Eckhart my favorite actor in this entire movie? Because if he couldn't accurately show Dent's fall from grace in a painful and dramatic performance, then I don't think this movie could've worked as well as it did. To me, Harvey Dent is the main character of this story and Aaron Eckhart is the main reason I enjoy the movie when I watch it again. Of course, it is still nice to see Heath Ledger as the Joker but it is the truth.\n\nEckhart had to play two characters in one movie and accurately depict what emotion he is feeling at every moment. When Dent allowed Gotham to arrest 549 criminals, at that moment he would feel proud and confident. Eckhart shows this confidence in the way he talks, the way he walks, even in his dialogue. \"The mob doesn't scare me.\" He says this when the Joker threatens Dent and two others.\n\nSomething that I want to point out, is that every time Eckhart says the name \"Rachel,\" it has some emotion attached to it to make it unique. When he talks to her normally, he talks nicely to be polite. When Rachel is about to die and he is being dragged from certain death, Dent wails Rachel's name over and over again until the explosion signals that she has died. Or when the Joker can't remember Rachel's name and Dent shouts Rachel's name angrily to remind the Joker of who he killed. This wide array of emotions is why I believe Eckhart to be the best actor in this film. \n\nNow I haven't even mentioned the actual main character of the story which is Bruce Wayne/Batman played by Christian Bale. And the reason I haven't mentioned him is that I find batman's character is kind of forgettable. I am not saying that Christian Bale's performance is bad but the script doesn't give anything for Bale to do other than do what the story needs him to do. The couple times the movie does stop to reflect on what Bruce Wayne is feeling after all these events, I feel like I hardly get any meaningful information out of those moments. \n\nNow compare Bruce Wayne's arc to Harvey Dent's arc. Both have lost the person that meant the most to them in their lives and Dent says \"Why was it me who was the only one who lost everything?\" to which Batman replies \"It wasn't.\" Since the film devoted so much time fleshing out Dent's character and his romantic relationship with Rachel, him saying that he lost everything makes sense in this scene's context. However, when Batman is trying to suggest he lost everything too, it feels unearned because this movie hasn't given me a reason to believe that he has lost everything. I have been told by Bruce and Alfred that he has lost everything, but I haven't been shown a good memorable moment where I believed that Bruce truly lost everything in this movie. So sorry, but Batman was forgettable in his own movie.\n\nI still don't think I can effectively critique cinematography and editing, and what makes good shots or good edits, but I can say that from a writing and acting standpoint this movie is solid, but I still have my problems with it. \n\n8/10 This movie is phenomenal from a writing standpoint and has lots of stellar performances. Thank you Christopher Nolan.",

I felt that much of it could have been condensed or omitted while retaining similar twists, suspense, and thematic discussions. Highlights of this film included the cast; Freeman, Oldman and Caine were excellent while Heath Ledger (R.I.P.) was simply brilliant as the Joker. Meanwhile, Rachel, the only woman in Gotham City, has been recast. I don't blame Katie Holmes for not reprising her role here, because in this film Rachel has been reduced even further from her two dimensional role as childhood-sweetheart-and-unattainable-love-interest into a caricature of a simpering, simple, damsel in distress. I found her portrayal in this movie to be almost unwatchable, and I felt absolutely nothing when she died. This was a massive waste of a character and undermined the emotional impact of the story. Meanwhile, the one Black man in this film outside of Morgan Freeman served one purpose: to look scary and intimidating in order to pull of a surprise message. A message which, by the way, felt weirdly out of place within the plot. Overall, this sequel is a strong continuation of the series and manages to explore a number of mature and serious themes, however, it could have done so with more cohesion and more emotion.",

And b) the movie affects or represents our culture to an extreme degree. The Dark Knight accomplishes both of these things in 2.5 hours. It is, without a doubt, one of the best films ever made. From the beginning, we are put into the angle of a villain who represents the opposite of Batman. Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, represents order, steadiness, and morality. The Joker represents the polar opposite: chaos, destabilization, and the belief that everybody is morally corruptible. The biggest feat of this movie is that the villain is correct. Every single person is capable of evil, and that's the underlying message of this film. Harvey Dent represents everything good about Gotham. He has hope and strong moral values. But the Joker is at work in him, slowly eating away at the underside of Gotham like acid. And when the Joker picks Harvey Dent, all falls to chaos. It is difficult to describe how deep the relationships between all of the characters are. From the opening bank robbery scene, to the Joker's epic conclusion, to Two Face's violent crimes, the hate of the characters in this movie can practically be felt through the screen. The Joker is physically greater than Batman; he is not stronger, but impossible to physically and mentally break. Batman's pathetic attempts against him are feeble against the underlying plan of the Joker. \"Madness, as you know, is like gravity... all it takes is a little push.\"",

The Dark Knight is no exception. The basic premise of Batman versus his arch nemesis Joker is elevated by a complex dark story in which Joker (masterfully played by Heath Ledger, his best performance to date, unfortunately he died after the shootings ended and missed his Supporting Actor Academy Award) is to terrorize and wreak havoc in Gotham City.  Anyways, Batman (played by method actor Christian Bale, truly iconic) and Chief Gordon team up and try to stop Joker's evil plan. However, Joker always seems to be a step further, which makes the mission harder than expected. We see that instead of a non descript Joker who does want to control the city just because he has to be the villain (Yes we are taking about you Cesar Romero, couldn't even shave his own moustache for the role), we have a very anarchic Joker. An ambiguous one, whose backstory variations contradict one another and his goals are beyond our understanding. Beyond sanity and logic. He tortures people just for the fun of it and burns currency just for the hell of it. He is a plethora of emotions and characters into one, quite possibly Alex from A Clockwork Orange and Jack Nicholson's Joker. That is what makes him an effective and menacing villain in this movie. We also cannot forget Chrstopher Nolan's tense, fast paced direction, which makes every scene gripping and breathtaking and the technical achievements on tis one, particularly the cinematography, the sound, the makeup and the visuals. Topping all of that with Hans Zimmer's signature minimalistic score and an amazing opening sequence, I must say that The Dark Knight is a revolutionary and gripping film that anyone, even those who despise superhero movies, will have to watch because of its being a versatile film. It manages to be an action, thriller, drama, mystery and a Superhero film altoghether. The half a star I cut will be for the whole Hong Kong sequence which I found superfluous and literally didn't affect the plot in any sort of way.",

The \"voice\" hasn't aged well. There are also a few scenes that are so absurd that I couldn't stop shaking my head. Like when Batman jumps out the window to save Rachel and they crush a guys car, say a goofy line, and then nothing. Cut away to Luscious. The Joker is still a few stories up harassing party guests. Do Rachel and Batman go get coffee or something? The Joker will have to leave the building somehow???? If he doesn't have a Laugh Wing, that means out through the lobby he goes. Right past Rachel and Mr. B still foreplaying it up over the top of an innocent driver just trying to get home to his family. How does this darkly lit grappling gun work? Does it spear into the wall or wrap around random things? How didn't attach itself to the Joker when Batman shot it at him? I'm going to imagine it spearing him. It will only get worse with age.",

Whenever he was on screen every single bit of attention just shifted towards him. He truly stole the show here. And another remarkable performance comes from Aaron Eckhart. I haven't seen too many people praising him and I really think he kills it here as Harvey Dent as well. This movie is extremely close to perfection, but some very small details that I have noticed have got to me, which are some minor plot holes. Anyway, The Dark Knight might be overrated by some, but it is a really, really good movie in its own right. Nolan keeps his original idea for the franchise, which is having a grounded and realisitic Batman, and just crafts the plot around it, which isn't the most original plot, but it's simple and complex at the same time somehow.

            "content": "Such a great Nolan film! Just like Batman Begins, you have to look at this as a Nolan film rather than expecting a big Batman movie, but it does get Batman right. Overall, I liked it better than Batman Begins (which I also gave five stars), but I had two problems with this movie that I believe Batman Begins did better. The first was Rachael. I didn't love the new actress as much, and because her character progresses, since it wasn't the same actress, some of the big events in the film weren't as intense and perfect as they could've been with either the actress from Batman Begins or having this actress play Rachael in Batman Begins also. The second was that it didn't focus on Bruce Wayne as much, but seeing as the first film covered that a lot I actually didn't mind it too much. It was clear that Batman Begins had a focus on why Bruce Wayne became a hero, while this film is how Bruce Wayne is a hero. I haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises yet but I am guessing it is thematically about why we need heroes like him. Overall, the cinematography and acting (besides Rachael) were still phenomenal, and this film was really intense in a lot of the scenes, even though it could've been better with Katie Holmes, although I won't dock the film any points for that because it most likely was not Nolan's decision to replace her, and they maybe didn't have enough time to change the movie to feel better with the new actress. Heath Ledger was so good in this movie (and MINOR SPOILER: I liked how he kept changing his story behind his scar, showing how crazy he is). Because of the new Rachael actress and how they slightly changed her character (which doesn't work because it doesn't feel like a natural progression with a different actress and different portrayals), I give this film a 9.5/10, but it would be a 10/10 with the previous actress. Also, every time they did briefly focus on Bruce Wayne, it was still great. \n\nP.S: As great as it was, I wouldn't call it THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER, because 1.) It doesn't always feel like one, which is what people like, but still, and 2.) It depends on what mood you are in, as sometimes you may want a great comedy superhero movie like Guardians of The Galaxy or a big one like Avengers: Endgame. The Dark Knight isn't perfect, but it's great.\n\nFor Reference, my review of Batman Begins:\n\nAmazing movie. The only thing is that you have to expect a slower-paced movie, but one that is fascinating and enjoyable the whole way through. It is everything amazing and adult about Batman in some of the comics, and it is a great Nolan movie. Try not to look at it as a Batman film though, just let the director (Christopher Nolan) tell his story, one that happens to be about Batman. All of the actors are amazing, but Christian Bale easily is the best actor in the film IMO, and with all of the great actors, that is saying a lot. Although, his Batman voice can slightly cringe. Otherwise, this is a very good start to the trilogy, even if many overlook it due to its sequels.",

Ultimately, the movie is anarchy versus \"the people\" and features an antagonist with real power through bought loyalty, chance and average, disorder, and his anarchist ideals, featuring a very mulit-faceted plot; rather than a purple eggplant and his magic glove that sloppily incorporates a simple plot,--as an example of today's modern superhero movies. The entire story revolves around Batman, a symbol of dark justice without jurisdiction, and Harvey Dent, the people's white knight who is very fallible and open to attack, who fights along side him in a gamble that may undo all his work in the name of justice.

To begin with the character is flawlessly written, Jokers goal is essentially to fix society. The Joker throughout the entire film showcases what is wrong with society and forces people to make these extremely difficult decisions that challenge their morals. When you take that writing and pair it with the phenomenally psychotic performance given by Heath Ledger you get one of the greatest characters in cinematic history.\n\nChristian Bale of course returns as Batman and does an amazing job once again. The Joker forces Bruce to make certain decisions about what Gotham needs versus what is right and it really challenges Bruce. It makes him question his morals and question whether or not what he is doing is inspiring good or creating more evil.\n\nAaron Eckhart is extremely underrated as Harvey Dent. His character is basically Batman as a District Attorney, they have the same goals but achieve them in different ways. But when he loses Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) his response is much different from Bruce's. Dent loses faith in society and with a little push from Joker he becomes Two-Face and shows what can happen when society pushes someone over the edge.\n\nThis movie is perfect in every way and I can not thank Christopher Nolan enough for another phenomenal film.\n\n10/10",

            "content": "The Dark Knight was a defining moment in Christopher Nolan's career. What I admire in Nolan is that he seems to find the perfect balance between thrilling blockbuster and a rich and full story, The Dark Knight is one of the best examples of this. The overall direction and writing of this film makes Batman, who, before these movies was still the campy 60s Batman to a lot of the public, the dark and gritty character we're so used to today. Batman, as a character, is absolutely timeless, and Nolan recognizes this, making the topics in his movies timeless as well. We have all felt chaos in our lives, and the Joker is a great representation of that, which, compared to Christian Bale's Batman symbolic as a man focused on justice, is an excellent contrast. While Christian Bale is fine as Batman, I did prefer his performance in Batman Begins. The performance that really makes this movie work is obviously Heath Ledger as the Joker. The way he manages to capture that character in such a menacing way is admirable. It's a shame that he won't be able to play the Joker again, because the simply way that he spoke is immediately recognizable. My biggest complaint would be the look of the film. I understand what Nolan was going for, but aesthetically, a lot of this film was extremely dark. It would have been nice to see Batman against a grey sky at some point. I also found that the two-face story line was extremely rushed, and should have been fleshed out in its own movie, as the character is great. I just feel like it was an underused plot-line, the character should have been set up as two face near the end. That way, the Joker would still have an effect on the story, and the story would have been more fluid. I know a few people who prefer Batman Begins, saying that the story is a lot less forgettable, yet, while parts of this story are forgettable, the characters are much more fleshed out and the story is much more compelling. This movie marked a significant change in the superhero genre, and that's no easy feat.",

Christian Bale brings a gravitas to his role that is not easily duplicated in the other entries of this trilogy. And Aaron Eckhart makes a great transition from the \"white knight of Gotham\" to Two-Face, albeit a rather short and sudden transition. Lastly, although I love Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine as much as anybody else, Gary Oldman deserves the highest praise as Commissioner Gordon; he is always fantastic in every movie.\nI'll share a key quality of a great movie: when you think it's over and excitedly find that you are just halfway through! I'll never forget thinking that it would be fine if the movie ended after Joker was initially captured, and to my surprise had another hour of wonderful movie to enjoy! \nIn the end, the Dark Knight is hands down the best Christopher Nolan movie, the best Batman movie, and one of the best movies, period, of all time, in my opinion.

He is fittingly fidgety and unpredictable, the perfect foil to Christian Bales's boring, noble, scratchy-voiced Batman. The lip licking, the sudden spurts of violence, the complete lack of fear of death or pain make Ledger's Joker a truly formidable villain. However, the rest of the movie falls far below the level of his performance. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman's characters are just as bland and uninteresting as they were in the original. The real sin the movie commits is that it pretends to be more than it is, a silly super hero movie, by adding supposed layers of philosophy and sociology and pretentious \"intellectual\" dialogue, and to me that's the most insulting thing a film can do. It's as if Christopher Nolan knows he can't give a Batman movie a weightier theme than hero-in-an-animal-themed-tight-suit-fights-bad-guy-with-a-crazy-plan-to-destroy-the-city, but tries anyway, in an attempt to justify to himself and his viewers why he's making yet another movie about the caped crusader. Even without all the artificial philosophy, the plot is nonsensical and it is entirely unenjoyable for the sole reason that it is played out so seriously. Unlike the 1966 Batman, which did the opposite, this movie attempts to pass every second of itself off as believable, realistic, and dark. The second villain in Aaron Eckhart's Two Face just tops it off when he defies the tremendous pain he must be in after having had half his head burned off by threatening monsters and kidnapping hostages. And the meant-to-be-realistic effect of his burned face looks sillier than purple makeup would have. The only reason it's been so well received is that it's purported depth makes superhero nerds feel like their favorite kind of movie has a place in great cinema.",

It starts with Joker, played by Heath Ledger, robbing a bank with some hired goons he's paid to off each other as they rob the bank. Why does he want them all to kill each other? This is never really explained. However, the scene is tense and exciting. We see Batman apprehend the Scarecrow and some drug dealers as well as some Batman wannabes. From there the movie becomes like a crime drama about taking down the mob while the joker creates havoc. Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is as great as everyone says it is, but I feel like the character could have benefitted from some better dialogue. He often starts philosophizing about some vague ideas he has about human nature and anarchy and it feels pseudo-intellectual. It's obvious the movie is trying to be deep with this stuff, but it just comes off as pretentious. Aaron Ekhart as Harvey Dent I feel doesn't give a very compelling performance and after he becomes scarred his motivation to commit crime as Two-Face seems lacking. Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne isn't a very dynamic protagonist, he plays him somewhat stiff and dull and as Batman he goes way over the top in trying to sound intimidating. However, the movie is exciting and there are scenes with the Joker that are very well directed and nerveracking. Overall, it's solid but overrated.",

            "content": "Batman goes to war with The Joker.\n\nChristopher Nolan's noir film The Dark Knight (2008) is a landmark of cinematic excellence. I remember being stunned in theaters when I first watched this phenomenal crime picture. I actually started to collect all the movie tickets after seeing The Dark Knight because this movie made me realize how important movies are to me.\n\nHeath Ledger steals the show as a modern and malevolent incarnation of Batman's archnemesis The Joker. He is gleeful in his chaotic violence and careless anarchism that is truly frightening. Ledger is so remarkable as Joker that every single line he utters, mumbles, or giggles out in The Dark Knight is quotable and unforgettable. He is the definitive version of Joker to me surpassing Cesar Romero, Mark Hamill, Jack Nicholson, Jared Leto, or even Joaquin Phoenix. Ledger proves everyone that doubted his casting wrong as he is magnificent as Joker. I miss him so dearly. I wish he never died so that you could know how much we all loved him. Rest in paradise Heath Ledger.\n\nChristian Bale is outstanding as the brave and dejected Bruce Wayne, while being fearsome and intimidating as Batman. His impressive physique, quiet manner, piercing expressions, and heartfelt emotional connection create a fully formed character out of this comic book hero. Bale was born to play Batman. Michael Caine returns as the dry witted English butler to Batman named Alfred Pennyworth. I love his monologue about hunting a bandit who, \"just want to watch the world burn.\" Gary Oldman is courageous and kind as the likable Commissioner James Gordon.\n\nAaron Eckhart is glorious as the smug and confident Harvey Dent in all his just lawyering, while haunting and scary as Two-Face. \n\nI'm still not crazy about Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. I still wish Katie Holmes had returned as her intelligent and sincere Rachel. She had such natural chemistry with Christian Bale. Gyllenhaal is still lovely and apt for the role of Rachel, but she plays her so differently. She is not as affectionate as Holmes was with Bale and seems more dedicated to Harvey than her work, so that you never think she'd end up with Bruce Wayne anymore. I think Maggie unfairly had a hard time after The Dark Knight came out and people insulted her looks because she is still excellent as Rachel and gets some serious dramatic moments I will not spoil.\n\nMorgan Freeman is more conscious of his ethics and morals as the steadfast Lucius Fox. Chin Han is fun as Mr. Lau. Eric Roberts is excellent as usual as the crime boss Sal Maroni. Keith Szarabajka is excellent as the tough cop guarding Joker in the interrogation room called Gerard Stephens. William Fichtner is so awesome as the brave, if foolish, bank manager Joker robs in the killer cold open to The Dark Knight. He wields a shotgun like great gravitas and intent. I like Cillian Murphy's fun cameo as Scarecrow. Lastly, David Dastmalchian is truly amazing as the insane Thomas Schiff. His crazy face is so striking that you never forget him here.\n\nThe Dark Knight is intelligent, original, and masterful. Christopher Nolan's direction and writing are immortalized within this essential feature film. Nolan upped the ante after his sublime motion picture Batman Begins by bringing Joker to the silver screen once more after Jack Nicholson's incarnation in Tim Burton's Batman. Nolan's ambition and scale are impressive as he opens with a killer bank robbery, pulls off a shocking car chase, and converts Chicago into Gotham so that you always feel you're looking at a real place. The Dark Knight is a must see movie because it's 152 minutes of pure Batman lead action.\n\nChristopher Nolan's direction is astounding. He finds every clever angle, twist, and new way to show Batman's old tricks. There's nothing more I can say about The Dark Knight that other critics and fans have not praised for over a decade now. Nolan went overboard with the engaging complex story about Batman facing decisions over whether or not to remain as Batman or retire with Rachel only to get pulled into a tumultuous conflict with Joker and Two-Face. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's script is stuffed with funny jokes, shocking reveals, harrowing violence, and clever setups with thrilling payoffs.\n\nLee Smith's editing is sleek and polished so that you always know what's happening even as Smith cuts all over Gotham as several storylines will converge at once into a wave of crime for Batman to contend with simultaneously. Wally Pfister's cinematography is already iconic. Joker burning the pile of money, Batman running into the night, or Joker standing in the middle of the street screaming for Batman to hit him are legendary wide shots. The visual effects are amazing, especially for Two-Face's make-up and CGI.\n\nHans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's score for The Dark Knight is so memorable that you will never forget the excitement at hearing their Batman theme. Lindy Hemming and Patrick Caulfield designed iconic and striking purple and green suits for Joker to adorn. Their Batsuits are cool and modern just like Two-Face's half burnt suit. John Caglione Jr., Nancy Hancock, and Sue Robb-King deliver cinema's scariest make-up for Joker's garrish clown face.\n\nIs The Dark Knight perfect? No, I cannot lie, but that does not detract from how magnificent a film it remains with enthralling action and heartbreaking drama that makes you think and feel. Not sure why after Batman catches Rachel from falling, he just leaves a room full of people at the fundraiser alone with Joker. I hate the line, \"No more dead cops\" as well as the police officer complaining while a helicopter flies towards him and he only slightly alarmed says, \"That's not good.\" I can forgive that bad line and poor acting. It's also strange how the Batmobile jump cuts into the parking complex in the beginning from where it would have had to drive up the side to get its dramatic entrance. But, I can chalk that up to a strange edit and he's Batman so he can do whatever.\n\nIn all, The Dark Knight will persevere as one of the very best Batman movies as well as one of Christopher Nolan's greatest films. It still gets ranked up with the greatest films of all time everywhere and I cannot disagree. The Dark Knight is always an intense and entertaining watch.",

And of all the superhero movies made over the past 20 years, it is safe to say that this is the best. \nAs a kid, I loved the Marvel movies. I hated DC. But as I grew up, I found myself drawn to the Christopher Nolan trilogy, a much darker set of movies when compared to the somewhat childish Marvel franchise. I find that, other than the recent addition of Endgame, the Marvel movies are somewhat stale, predictable, and lacking in emotional depth. I find movies such as The Dark Knight to be not only compelling, but much deeper as well. And that is not to say Marvel movies are bad, by no means. I must admit, other than the Nolan trilogy, DC movies are not very great themselves. Rather, it is Chistopher Nolan's incredible direction that makes his trilogy stand above the rest. However, The Dark Knight is by far the best, mostly because of Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, as well as the silent meditation on evil.",

            "content": "The Dark Knight is immediately willing to throw out everything that worked in Begins, in favour of something bold and new. Expectations were shattered in every respect. It took leftfield but wholly appropriate influences such as Heat and the more interesting comics like Gotham Central, to craft something not influenced by previous comic book movies. And Nolan, trusted to be let loose, refined his style that is still, in many ways, his absolute peak.\n\nThe sound and sound mix quality is absolutely superb, right from the opening, there are some expansive layers and breadth to it. I mean it's maybe one of the best I've ever heard. And Zimmer's score here is the coursing lifeblood of the movie, the nerves and sinew. The intensity and fear and chaos. That's why I think it's unquestionably Zimmers best modern electronic score; it was fresh, it's necessary not distracting.\n\nDialogue crackles. Scenes whip by so fast that you sit up and pay attention. And this film would have rocketed along and been very good indeed as it starts out to be. But then the movie turns its up to eleven. And chaos turns up. The exact thing to disrupt this perfect political drama and turn it on its head. The joker. \n\nWhat to say that hasn't been said about The Joker?\n\nHe's the embodiment of Post-911 fear. The movie keeps wanting to tell us, don't give in to terrorists or to fear or they win. He's not crazy. And he's super smart and he's not a psychopath either. He's funny and he knows humour. That means something. That means he's capable of greater evil. His backstory is simultaneously a sort of fourth wall joke, the different versions something that only the Joker could know is a private joke, and yet is completely serious to him. His backstory is frightening and unknown, just the same way that the motives for terrorism were certainly, at the time, unknowable and serious and shifting.\n\nThe Dark Knight taught us that comic book movie adaptations didn't have to only rely on the previously set tones of their forefathers, it still is a beacon of comic adaptations future, teaching them to unshackle and find something real to say, without TDK, Wolverine simply wouldn't have known that it could have borrowed from Westerns to create Logan.\nTwo-Face is a great example of taking the origins of the character in the comics and twisting it to fir this world; the casting of perfect pretty-boy Eckhart, the way he gets his name from a past in IA which links to Gordon and even his hatred of Gordon, the bait and switch in the courtroom, all perfected when the ballerina places a menu in front of his face and it's clear how much of a White Knight he is and could be. It's elegant stuff really. And when his dark side kicks in he doesn't seem like an actor playing anger, there's a hitherto unseen rage inside Eckhart that bursts out in a deviousness and a genuine darkness.\n\nIn terms of plot, think of a better film that kills of the childhood sweetheart of the main hero and she wasn't super powered and didn't come back to life? These days they'd tear this choice away from the filmmakers on the basis of franchise longevity but here they went full-tilt.\n\nThe shifts in ratio from IMAX to 35mm and back again aren't jarring as they feel right in the edit - there's flow, a kind of intentional idea of how to cut inbetween almost seamlessly or certainly artfully, it's really a pleasure even if you focus on it. This is unlike absolute clusterfucks like Transformer's ironically titled: The Last Knight. \n\nIt's got flaws: An act too many, even though it's brisk and well made. And things like the Jokers contrived plan to get caught, which was all the rage at the time, is farfetched and plot-hole-inducing. Also I'm sure the way that he gets prints off of a bullet makes no sense. \n\nNice little quirks are present here: The well cast Mr. Reese that can be read as a possible nod to The Riddler (Mysteries!). The Gotham Central connections stood out well, as did the moments taken from The Long Halloween. And that Batpod reveal still takes me by surprise no matter how much I've seen this movie, and like the first time has me fist-pumping and cheering and grinning from ear to ear. And there are many great filmmaking choices that I only registered upon watching this time, such as Alfred saying goodbye to Rachel who dies shortly after, giving her character a modicum of closure before we realise it. And that editing: The slam of the door on Harvey's face and more little moments that are almost laugh out loud in how damn cheeky they are. This is bravura actual honest-to-god filmmaking. \n\nAnd still there's more: The Joker's yellow teeth because of course he doesn't brush. That phone explosion seen more powerfully from far away. The epic truck/security van chase with no music that just bristles with 70's cop movie electricity. And how powerful a moment when a man who is saved can be screaming to wish he was dead because if he's alive then someone he loves will be dead in his place. Good stuff Nolan, you may now make whatever you want for the rest of your life.",

They took what I loved about the first movie and made it better by having a story where the hero is getting outsmarted. Christain Bale is Great again as Batman. The thing I think I love most about this movie is Heath Ledger's Joker. Heath Ledger's Joker is one of the best villains in cinema history. His voice just lingers with you and I like how he made the hero look like the villain in the end. I think what people forget about this movie is that Harvey Dent as Two-Face is just as good as Heath Ledger. I like how his character was fleshed out because at the start of the movie he was this optimistic guy who wanted to help the world and by the end of the movie He is a villain who is going out and killing people. I like how the Joker won in this movie because he proved to Gotham city that a hero could become the villain overnight by one incident. As Harvey Dent becomes evil you can feel the emotion. The score in this movie is great and I like how Christopher Nolan wanted all the music to be composed and he didn't want any pop songs. Like Batman Begins I have nothing negative to say about this movie. In my opinion, this is not only the greatest batman movie ever made but is also the great comic book movie ever made and the greatest superhero movie.\n\nThis is my favorite movie of all time. I'm gonna give the Dark Knight an (A+)",

There are deeper problems that infest the superhero genre itself and are particularly egregious in The Dark Knight. Why is Gotham have so much crime? The script demands that we assume it's simply because there are some horrible individuals living there, exploiting others. But who are those people and why are they acting like that? \n\nThen we must ask: is it really only a wealthy, white man who can save Gotham from what is assumed to be a problem caused by individuals? What about the capitalist system on which Gotham runs, a system which has clearly enriched one family - the Waynes - but has failed to trickle down to the rest of the city's population? Is there no alternative, as the UK's right-wing politician Margaret Thatcher once claimed?\n\nUltimately, this film tells us that capitalism would be fine if only those annoying criminals who take its lessons about entrepreneurialism and wealth creation too seriously would stop breaking the law. And that white saviours are always the only solution to social problems - it's never about social solidarity, the people working together to take power back from those wealthy few who hoard it for themselves.",

The film slows down at some points, but is ultimately thrilling to watch due to the strong and exciting performances.",

The most impressive part of this movie is the acting. Christian Bale once again portrays the role of Batman, this time being filled with more doubt about the role of Batman in Gotham. Even though Bales does an incredible job portraying, Batman, Heath Ledger steals the show as the Joker. He brings depth and emotion to the villain, to the extend rarely seen in movies. Ledger captures the audience every second he is on the screen and provides this movie with one of the greatest acting performances ever. In addition, actors like Michael Caine as Alfred, Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent play excellent roles in this film.\nIn addition to the great acting, the musical score composed by Hans Zimmer is amazing. \nHis instrumental score is intense and complements the characters well.\nAnother great element of this plot is the plot. In this movie you get to see the real protagonist, no, not Batman, Gotham evolves through previous and this film. You get to see how this city represents the worst and best parts of this city, and impact on each character.\nOverall, this film is incredible. It is a beautiful film that inspires the audience. Almost every element of this film is perfect, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone.",

The returning cast from Batman Begins are all great once again, Aaron Eckhart comes in and also plays a great role in the film as both Harvey Dent and Two Face. Elements of the cinematography were definitely an upgrade on Batman Begins, also Gotham just looked all round better in this than Batman Begins. The opening Joker bank scene may go down as one of the best ever opening scenes to any movie, it's truly phenomenal and straight away the audience gets a feel for the amazing Heath Ledgers joker. This film arguably has the best solo performance by any actor of all time. Heath Ledgers joker is iconic, it stun's but also terrify's the audience. When in his presence during the film, the atmosphere completely changes and that's down to Heath Ledgers performance, truly legendary.",

            "content": "The Dark Knight is the movie I've waited to see my entire life and let me tell you it was worth the wait.  The Dark Knight is spectacularly shot and is a visual treat, the acting does not disappoint with excellent performances from Aaron Eckhart, Christian Bale, and of course the one and only Heath Ledger.  Going into this film I was worried that the Joker would outshine the title character like in Batman 89 but I was pleased to see that Batman had a bigger part than the Joker.  That is not to say that the Joker is bad, in fact Heath Ledger is probably the best live action Joker ever, he is a real presence in the film and the great thing about the Joker in The Dark Knight is that he has no origin story he just wants to \"watch the world burn.\"  I'd say that the worst part about the movie is the recasting of Rachel; after watching Batman Begins a hundred times I really got used to Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes.  Christian Bale is even better in this film than he was in Batman Begins; the bat-suit is also a huge improvement over the last film,  this time around Batman can actually move his head and it has a cool sleek design which looks a lot more maneuverable.  After watching The Dark Knight it really made me see what we are missing in super-hero movies these days.  Today most super-hero flicks rely on the same shtick and gimmicks, and they all feel as if they are not so much of a movie as a TV show that lasts for two hours, The Dark Knight reminded me of what a movie looks like.  The Dark Knight is my favorite Batman film ever and it might even be my favorite movie of all time, it is a master class in character, visuals, and story.  It is deserving of the title of best super-hero film ever made and of one of the best movies ever made.",

The story serves as a sequel to Batman Begins but has its own plot so you can understand 95% of the story without watching Batman Begins.This deserves the title of the best movie of all time.",

I love Batman begins, in my opinion is on the best comic book films of all time, and that scene at the end, where lieutenant Gordon hands Batman a joker card... it was great.\nThere was a lot of expectation for this movie, the villain was the joker, one of the greatest villains (if not the greatest) in cinema history. Cristopher Nolan said that he choose Heath Ledger to play the joker, because he wasn't afraid. He wasn't afraid to play such an  iconic character, it's not easy to play the joker, people like Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson put the bar very high, it was a risk to accept this role. And it was worth, his interpretation will be remembered forever, he is amazing, the deep voice, the gestures he does, everything is perefect. Christian Bale is also very good, great as Bruce Wayne and Batman. One of the strong aspects of the movie is the pacing, it's a 2 and a half hour movie and I didn't feel it's run time at all, Lee Smith and Nolan did a great job, there's montages with voice over that makes the film to have better pacing.\nIn my opinion the best part of the movie is the second act, it's where it has more tension, and where we get to se more of the Joker, he is freaking smart, everything he does it's calculated, and even though Bruce and lieutenant Gordon know what he is going to do, he manages to outplay them in some way.\nThe cinematography is very good it has very good aerial shots, and wide shots that makes the movie look very good.\nThe score... Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard did a great job, it fits perfectly for the action scenes, and the dramatic scenes, I personally like more the one from Batman begins, but this one is great too. This is not only a great comic book movie, but a great movie, with a unforgettable interpretation of the joker, this is highly recommended if you haven't seen this movie, please do yourself a favor and watch it.\n\n",

That didn't go anywhere and didn't serve the purpose. Next, when we first see the Joker and he escapes in a bus, how did he know that it would end up that way in the precise predicament? It was overblown. Yet, another thing with the Joker, and that happened in the long ending of it. Where he tries to blow up the ships. The turn around of the Harvey Dent also played a part of him going rogue. I didn't buy it with his talk of going insane by the Joker. Lastly, the person that Bruce Wayne is in love but is disbanded and killed off. You can tell me if I'm wrong, but having her dying in a drastic way, it was kind of a 'no surprise' there situation. It missed the mark and that's why I have it rated so low. But, I am thoroughly engaged from the performances. Completely from the beginning, middle, and end of it I was engaged. Some have this rated so high, and I can and can't understand why. I liked the movie, but think it's way too much overrated. Solid great film, much better than the lot of them, but it missed the mark for me. ",

            "content": "I am going to start this review by saying that this is my favourite movie of all time. Every single second of the two hour and thirty-two minute run time is amazing to watch; there is never a dull moment. I will start off by saying that this review will be spoiler free at first, but later on I will get into spoilers. I will warn you when that happens so be on the lookout. To start, let's talk about The Joker. Heath Ledger, rest in peace, is phenomenal as The Joker. This is, in my opinion, the best acting performance of all time. I do not see someone acting here. I see a terrifying villain who had footage recorded of him, and the footage was used for the movie. That is how good Heath Ledger is in this film. You also have Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He is spectacular as well. A lot of people say that the voice gets on their nerves, but I personally really enjoy it. It makes sense to me, seeing as he wants to keep his identity secret, that a voice like that would be used. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent is also spectacular. Without spoilers, he is great early and later on in the movie. The writing of this movie is fantastic, as there are two different ideologies at work here. Batman has the rule that he cannot kill anyone, and The Joker wants chaos, he wants to prove that the people of Gotham are just like him. This creates a very exciting dynamic between the two characters that never goes away. I am now going to talk spoilers, so if you have not seen the movie, stop reading, and go watch the movie. The first thing I want to talk about here is the interrogation scene. This is some of the best dialogue in any movie I have ever seen. The Joker is toying with Batman, wasting his time so that he can ensure Batman will have to make a choice between to people; Rachel or Harvey. The Joker later switches the addresses so that no matter who Batman chose, he would kill the person he wanted to save. The cinematography in this scene is also fantastic. The camera starts with The Joker on one side and Batman on the other. As the scene goes on, the camera position changes, and the sides are switched almost seamlessly. This implies that Batman is crossing over to The Joker's side, that The Joker is winning. This is what I believe to be the best scene in the movie. Later on in the movie, Harvey Dent is in an accident and becomes Two-Face. This is where Aaron Eckhart really shines as Harvey. His character development makes complete sense, as he has been through a traumatic experience in  losing his fiancee, and The Joker manipulated him soon after. It is very heart breaking to see such a good man become so terrible, but you can really understand why this is happening. Now for the ending of the movie. Batman breaks his one rule at the end of the movie by killing Harvey Dent. Through fighting The Joker, he realized that sometimes he would need to break the rules for the greater good of everyone else. He realized that he was not a hero, he was something more. He was whatever Gotham needed him to be. That last part was taken from the movie, because it is just so powerful. Things echoed to Bruce earlier on in the film, things he does not believe at first, but by the end of the movie the character arch is complete, and he knows what he must do for the city of Gotham. The order in which we are shown the closing shots is important too. Because the last thing seen is Batman riding away, with Gordon explaining to his son about Batman being a watchful protector, it leaves a feeling of ambiguity; it feels like he could be back one day. If you have read through regardless of spoilers, watch it. If you have seen the movie before, watch it again. It is my favourite movie of all time, and even if it is not yours, it is still a fantastic movie. ",

The Dark Knight is the sequel to Batman Begins and if that movie was any indication of how Nolan's series would go, you were wrong because this film exceeds every expectation and gives you more than you possibly could have ever dreamed of in a Batman movie. This film is contextually darker, but does not appear physically darker, this movie is a psychological battle for the most part and it works perfectly with the style and tone of the Joker in this movie. Speaking of the clown prince of crime, Heath Ledger completely reinvented villains because of his take on the Joker, he gave a once in a lifetime (Oscar-winning), outstanding performance. I mean, Ledger gave it his absolute all in this role and it payed off bigtime, he had a great voice for the Joker, and he had that dark and twisted humour that was necessary for success in his role, and he delivered. Lets not exclude the Batman here, Bale once again played his role perfectly, but he kind of takes a back seat to the Joker in this movie, and we get more of Bruce Wayne than we do of Batman, but nobody minds that too much because the Joker is the main attraction here, the movie knows that and it centers around his character giving us plenty of screen time. This movies script is amazing and it gives the Joker so many great lines, almost everything he says is instantly iconic and memorable. Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart both killed it in this movie, they both gave their best performances and they are really good as their characters. Oldman IS commissioner Gordon, he really sells his fantastic performance and he becomes Gordon, you really do forget that he's just an actor reciting lines from a script, he was just so good. Eckhart is very underrated in this movie, he is an excellent DA and political crime fighter and he does it with such poise and and charisma, he is also pretty good as Two-Face. This movie really got Harvey Dent right, they introduced him and showed us what he stands for and believes in, and the movie builds up his character greatly and then shows us his fall to Two-Face, it was a great character arc that is clearly visible and understandable. Michael Caine was once again great as Alfred. The other cast members include Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Nestor Carbonall, and William Fichtner who were all great as well. The Batpod in this movie is amazing, it looks and moves great and it is really cool, way better than the tumbler. This film is a cinematic masterpiece with a great story, great script, great score, great characters and character development, gorgeous cinematography, great practical effects, great tone, great themes, great performances, and it raised the bar for comic-book/superhero movies, that I doubt that it can ever be passed. This is one of my all time favorite films ever created, it is flawless and Christopher Nolan directed the hell out of this movie, he will be remembered as one of the greatest directors in cinematic history just because of this movie alone. I strongly recommend viewing this precious piece of art and basking in all of its glory right after Batman Begins, you will not be dissapointed.    ",

Ergo, this season is politically influenced, challenged and correct. Above all the intricacies of the plots suggested in this crime saga, my personal favorite, is how human this said-superhero is treated.\n\nWith clean crime comes a clean film. Compared to the previous adventure of the Batman, the action is crisp, smart and a complete fanatic of itself. Take the characters, for instance. On what stage and state they are in. The reason I'd like to think, they all fail and never were ever going to reach the salvation they hope for, is because they barely are thinking about others. And here comes the final Nolan touch. All the \"bad guys\" of the film are actually thinking about others. Their ideologies hence remains above our heroes and their deeds not so much.\n\nAnd hence emerges, one of the finest and sensible villains, the history of cinema has ever encountered. The Joker played hungrily by Heath Ledger will stay timeless for both its performance and what it leaves and breathes for. And they are the questions, his cheats and lies, are actually vital questions that whips us now, just as they did then and they will in the future. For there is no definite answer or any answer that Nolan is throwing out in the world, it can float untouched in a bubble as much as you like. Personally, I felt Harvey Dent played like a bad boyfriend by Aaron Echart, has a last act that exceeds the Joker's final bluff in the game. Probably because the Joker's is a question- which comes in early- and Dent has a cold answer that no one wants to hear. And since his crux of the trick feeds on the last moment, watching those three wrong-doers play a game of chance feels like the best note to end a film on.",

Taking everything that worked from Batman begins and elevating these attributes to eleven, Nolan not only makes the best love action Batman movie of all time but the greatest superhero movie ever. Of course Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker is the highlight of this movie, as his highly chaotic and nihillistic version of the iconic character Captivates. This role is easily the crowning achievement of Ledgers career  Not only does he match the grace and execution of Nicholson's rendition but arguably tops it. ",

In this movie Nolan understood the relationship between Batman and the Joker, it\u00b4s so cool,I honestly i don't find much to complain about in this movie,the film has small failures, such as that the joker manages to stop a policeman to leave the cell, then an explosion happens and everyone dies, or passes out, or searches for bombs in all places except in the boat where people are. But I can really forgive that because I loved the movie.I have read that some critics criticize the final scene in which Batman blames himself for everything and they say that he is very forced or that he could have blamed another villain blah blah blah but seriously they think he would have seen Better if Batman had said something like: Gordon tell them it was the joker or any other criminal.

With the classic fight between batman, joker and gotham.\n\n\nThis movie starts out with harvey dent(Aaron Eckhart) becomes the district attorney but as that happens joker(heath ledger) robs a bank. At at the end the caped crusader has to stop joker from destroying two boats filled with civilians and prisoners. Will he succeed? That's for you to find out!\n\n\nThis directeur made many good decisions in this movie and only one bad thing. The good things are the special effects, the special effects in this movie make each scene perfect because the explosions looked like explosions, the guns firing looked like guns firing. Also the acting and scripts are amazing! the actors made each character come alive and the script suited the characters and what happens. Finally the camera angles. The camera angles made each scene perfect when going to gotham the establishing shots made the scene amazing. Sadly the bad thing is the scenes did not flow well it felt like it could be a police chase to a coffee breakfast!\u00a0\n\n\nIn this movie my favorite scene has to be the hospital explosion scene the way heath ledger walks is so funny it makes me laugh every time. You should know that this is a long movie at 2:32:00! Also this movie is not have swear words but is still not child friendly.\n\n\nIn conclusion i rate this movie a 9/10 for its near perfect experience. The missing part is that the scenes just don't flow that well. The target audience for this movie is boys ages 10-18. I think this because batman usually attracts males instead of females and the age group is because of the violence in the movie.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n",

I expected much more from big names like Christian Bale but I was sad to see that they all failed to provide a convincing performance. The acting is extremely amateur and forced. Not sure what went wrong - my theory is that a lot of the actors weren't properly trained to act in front of green screens which cost them a realistic performance. Obviously films are scripted but films are also supposed to convey a sense of realism which The Dark Knight miserably fails to do. The script is extremely cheesy and when you add the characters to the poorly worded dialogue, it comes off as a cringeworthy performance. It's unfortunate because these actors deserved better. I'll admit, when I first saw the film, I thought it was spectacular. So spectacular that I saw it again, and again, and again. Each time I began to uncover the truth behind the picture.

He took the character back to his dark roots as a terrifying, homicidal, carnage loving psychopath. He deserved that Oscar. The other actors were also incredible. Moving on to the visuals, the scenery and the action were absolutely incredible! This film was beautifully shot, with the lighting and scenery giving the atmosphere the dark and gritty tone it needed throughout the film. Complimenting the atmosphere beautifully is the film\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s soundtrack, which is phenomenal.\n\nAs for the story, it, too, Is great. I won\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t go into spoilers for those of you who haven\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t watched it, but I will say that it is more than just your typical story of good guys fighting bad guys. The protagonists have their own struggles, with plenty of drama besides the crime and action. Batman\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s own personal struggles and the the struggle of Gordan, Dent, and the Dark Knight to give the city a symbol of order and hope amidst fear and chaos provide a very engaging tale that goes far beyond the incredible fight scenes, explosions, and off the wall action. The themes and message of the story, again without spoilers, are also far beyond your typical superhero flick.\n\nOverall, this film stands on its own in the superhero genre. Where some superhero movies aim to be over the top and cheesy, this film is a welcome change. It\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s dark, serious, and thrilling from start to finish. There hasn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t been a movie like it before, and no movie like it has been made since its release. To put it simply, this is the superhero movie we deserve AND need.",

From the pulse-racing and INSANELY clever first scene to the emotionally powerful final scene, everything about this movie is perfectly-thought-out and formulated. The only complaint anyone could have is that Joker was left on a \"cliffhanger\", but that is only due to Ledger's unfortunate death. In other words, this movie is perfect, whether as the second in a trilogy or even a stand-alone. A perfect Batman movie, one that reinvented the genre, but also simply a perfect film.",

The reason I believe that is the best Batman film by far is showing why they call him the best detective in the world. Every Batman film is always presenting - in order - villain, tragedy, loss, encouragement, then a huge fight scene. It showed how Batman uses his wealth and expertise. But this film plays with Batman's rules. Every scene was surprising and intense with all the villains. The Joker was unbelievable.\n\nIf you are scrolling through these reviews, you'll see so many people say \"People just felt bad because he died young so they overreacted by giving him an Academy Award\". Ignores those idiots. It's a shame that Ledger died and did young - it's lucky that this is his last performance as in my opinion, it is his best. The Joker was scary, compelling and so unpredictable in every scene. It is dark, chilling and electrifying with the performance of a lifetime given by Heath Ledger. And of course, rest in peace. I loved the realism look to his character instead of the clean makeup and silky green hair, it was smudged paint, knotty hair, scars on his face. Also, the dark humor with the character was so simultaneous and entertaining. \n\nChristopher Nolan (unlike most directors) knows how to create a comic book flick. He handles the number of special effects and CGI very strong. Although I was a little weirded out about Two-Face. No, not the scary disturbing way it is supposed to be. In a way that it is bad CGI, not terrible but bad. It looked very slimy and looked as if it was moving all the time. In my opinion, they should've used makeup and possibly used a small amount of CGI for his eye. And his suit looked burnt which made no sense as I'm pretty sure not only would it fully burnt to dust, but I'm sure that the Hospital would've thrown it away. But the way they implemented Two-Face was incredible and Erik Eckhart personality he introduced for Two-Face was great.\n\nChristian Bale's acting was not at all bad. But I would say that this was (out of the three movies) his best and worst performance. At scenes, he amazingly showed how Batman wanted to kill Joker but couldn't since he doesn't want anyone to suffer as he did as a kid. But on some scenes, he didn't show anything impressive like he's done previously. Some people might say that this was the best superhero film as it used nearly included no CGI and almost all the explosions were real, it was authentic. I didn't think much of Cillian Murphy in the movie. Everything else was exceptional. If you are a huge Joker fan, watch this.",

Heath Ledger\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s Joker performance is incredible, the best villain of all time. Batman takes on all of the crime in Gotham by himself, he truly is the hero Gotham needs. The Joker tells the story of him getting the scars on his face twice throughout the movie, but the story changes each time. Bruce Wayne is very suave and represents New York executives. Bruce loves Rachel, but he can\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t date her because he\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s too busy being a vigilante.

Morgan Freeman\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s character Lucius Fox is very sharp as well and assists Bruce with management and new technologies. The scene where Batman is chasing The Joker in the Tumblr is very exhilarating. I also enjoyed when Batman interrogated the Joker at the police station. The joker seems really nuts in that scene. When Rachel dies in the fire, Harvey Dent couldn\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)t handle the heartbreak and he lost his mind. The scene with The Joker exiting the Hospital really cracks me up. There was a scene with two boats at the end of the film, one filled with citizens and one filled with convicts and they had to decide which one was going to die. This plot shows us how morbid the Joker is. Overall great movie. Nolan\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s Best 10/10.",

            "content": "A New Class of Criminal\n\nWith the tenth anniversary of The Dark Knight being this year, it only seems appropriate to take a look back one a film that has made history. The Dark Knight, a movie directed by Christopher Nolan, is arguably the greatest movie from the entire Batman series. With actors Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Heath Ledger all giving strong performances, this movie has many things that make it a great film to watch. The symbolism throughout this movie is one of good and evil, and can be related to almost any other plot along those lines. With a dark twist on your normal superhero movie, The Dark Knight is a thrill to watch. The Dark Knight is a movie that changed our world forever, whether we realized it or not.\n\tChristopher Nolan has had many great hits in the past, but The Dark Knight really sends it over the top, for me. The director of movies like Insomnia and Memento has really proven to be a fantastic director after his not-so-great movie The Prestige. One of the aspects that makes this movie one of the greatest movies of all time is quality the action scenes. Christopher Nolan did a wonderful job at creating scenes that keep the audience on their toes. The action scenes are packed with stunts and alongside a great score, each action scene keeps you enthralled in the movie. Most movies with lots of action scenes can get repetitive and often seem very cheesy, but not this movie. Nolan does an amazing job at sticking to the plot all the while making us all stay glued to the screen. Many say that they do not like to watch superhero movies because they are boring and not well done in comparison to most other movies; The Dark Knight is the antithesis to every other superhero move ever made prior its release. There is no happy ending, there are not scenes filled with foolish acting, and often times you may even forget that you are watching a superhero movie, because it is really that good. The Dark Knight is an incredible success for Christopher and his team, and we have seen him knock one out of the park yet again. The Dark Knight has played an important role in not only all comic book movies and shows, but also in every movie that we see now. The way that Christopher Nolan intertwined real life events with a super hero movie was something that had never really seen before. The way in which Nolan portrayed the world in The Dark Knight was obviously a darker, more intense version of our real world, but it is still a closely correlated world to that of our own. The film world was increasingly linking the problems of our everyday lives to the characters of their movies, and one of the films that obviously applied this method was The Dark Knight. We also see that the director might have been referencing himself throughout the movie with quotes that may have had double meanings. One instance in which we see an example of this is when the Joker says, \"this town deserves a better class of criminal.\" It is possible that Nolan is referring to himself in the world of Hollywood and how he knew that he was going to change the world in not only comic book movies, but also every movie that we would come to see. Before The Dark Knight, comic book movies were not dark and powerful like this one, and after it was released it was apparent that Nolan became a \"new class of criminal\" throughout the film industry.\n\tAlongside other great actors in this movie, such as Christian Bale, Heath Ledger delivered a surreal performance that can only be remembered as one of the greatest supporting actor roles in history. Heath Ledger has gone down as one of the greatest actors of all time, and a large part of that is due to his role in this film. Ledger died in 2008, shortly before the film was released. Even into 2009, Ledger continued to win film awards for best supporting actor, which has basically never been done before. Some say that his drug overdose was, in part, was due to the drugs that he was taking in order to complete his role as one of the greatest villains of all time. Heath Ledger showed the world a new standard for a movie villain that would change our world forever.\n\tThe symbolism throughout this movie is a great example of the good vs. evil that we see in our everyday lives. The Joker could be compared to the things in our world that we see are changing our world for the worse. Whether it is drugs or war, the evil things seem to always be poking at our society.  There is always going to be evil in our lives, and we are always going to see the good fight that evil, but hopefully we can always witness the good triumph. Some say that a movies villain is a great indicator of the quality of a movie, and with that being said, this movie is still one of the greatest.\n\tOverall, we can see that this movie is considered to be not only one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, but also one of the greatest of any movie. From an incredible director to a score that adds so beautifully to the ambiance of each scene, this movie is one to be watched time and time again without getting sick of. Christopher Nolan did an outstanding job at creating an absolutely mind-blowing film that would stay a favorite of many forever. When this movie was first released in 2008, we knew that it was a great movie; what we did not know, was that it would change the world of film forever and stay relevant for as long as we may live. For those of us who have been watching this movie time and time again over the last decade, we recognize the impact that it has had in the creation of movies in modern times. If you have not seen The Dark Knight, you are missing a new class of movie that this city needed.",

            "content": "When Christopher Nolan's second installment of his Batman franchise was released in theaters, the film was received extremely well by both audiences and critics. \"The Dark Knight\" was a box office hit, collecting a domestic box office yield of over $500 million (a feat only accomplished once before by Titanic). The film's immediate success was obvious, but the long-term impact it would have on the future of the film industry--particularly comic book films--could not have been fathomed. Now, ten years after the film was released, we can recognize just how influential \"The Dark Knight\" has been.\n\nIn the decade prior to the release of \"The Dark Knight,\" comic book movies had begun to gain popularity. The early 2000s saw the beginnings of Bryan Singer's X-Men franchise and Sam Raimi's Spiderman franchise. But with so many studios trying their hand at comic book movies, there was bound to be failure. The early 2000s also saw box office flops such as \"Daredevil,\" \"Elektra,\" and \"Catwoman,\" to name a few. By the mid 2000s, the future seemed rather dim for comic book movies. Then, there was \"The Dark Knight,\" the film that would change comic book movies forever.\n\nIn 2008, Nolan brought back actors Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman from the first installment of the franchise, and added others, such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Heath Ledger. With an all-star cast and crew, including award-winning composer and household name Hans Zimmer, the stage was set for success. What played out was nothing short of pure genius.\n\nOne of the things that makes \"The Dark Knight\" so memorable is the originality of the way in which Nolan chose to adapt the film from the popular comic book. Comic book film franchises of the early 2000s such as X-Men and Spiderman elected to take a safer approach to their films, with little variation from the comic books that inspired the films. Nolan's characters, however, seem to have been taken out of the comic book and placed into the real world, in a film that at times is less like a superhero movie and more like a crime-thriller. \"The Dark Knight\" addresses real-world issues. Critics have even drawn parallels between the cell phone surveillance technology that Batman uses to combat terrorism in Gotham and the controversial USA PATRIOT Act, and the film often reflects the moral ambiguity surrounding such technology.\n\nNolan's ability to create an original, real-world adaptation of a superhero comic book, and to do so successfully, was something that had never been done before. It was his unprecedented success, Abc News entertainment reporter Michael Rothman argues, that inspired comic book film adaptations in more recent blockbuster hits \"Thor: Ragnarok,\" \"Wonder Woman,\" and \"Black Panther.\" In an article [1] published over the summer, Rothman suggested that while all could technically be considered superhero movies, they could also be considered \"a fun space fantasy flick, a war period piece and a film on social injustice,\" respectively. It is interesting to note that these films are also some of the most critically acclaimed of their respective franchises.\n\nAnother memorable component of the film that has allowed The Dark Knight to stand the test of time is the complexity and originality of the film's villain, the Joker (Heath Ledger). The Joker is unlike other comic book villains. He is a critic of society and an anarchist. He is intelligent and terrifyingly unpredictable. In the film, he refers to himself as \"an agent of chaos\" and it is his chaotic and unpredictable nature that prompts Alfred (Michael Caine) to tell Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) that \"some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.\" He is also the perfect contrast to Bale's character. Bruce Wayne is a man of rules and order with a humanistic view of society, making him very predictable. The complexity of the Joker forces Bruce to become a more intelligent and capable hero in order to defend his city, and even though the film is a lengthy two hours and thirty-two minutes, the character development in the film captivates audiences for its entirety.\n\nThe originality of the film's adaptation from the comic book and the complexity of its antagonist made the film so popular among viewers that there was outrage when the film wasn't nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. The response may have contributed in large part to a change in the number of nominees for the award from five to ten the following year. Ten years later, many popular films such as the Pixar animated film \"Up\" (which was nominated for best picture in 2010), may have \"The Dark Knight\" to thank for their nomination.\n\nThe fact that we can still talk about Nolan's success with \"The Dark Knight\" ten years after it was released in theaters is evidence of its influence in film. At a time when comic book films seemed to be losing popularity with audiences and studios, \"The Dark Knight\" rekindled the flame. As a result, we can look back on a decade of superhero movies, each trying to emulate Nolan's success. The way that the \"The Dark Knight\" was adapted from the comic book and given a more crime-thriller feel, coupled with the complexity of its characters--particularly its antagonist--made the film something truly special. It has become the standard to which all superhero movies are held to, and it may be that way for years to come.\n\n1. https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/dark-knight-completely-changed-superhero-films/story?id=56625046",

Christopher Nolan done a brilliant job with Batman Begins, but done a whole better job with this masterpiece. Heath Ledger plays the Academy Awards winner performance of the fiendish Joker who terrorizes the citizens of Gotham city. This  is the best live action Joker performance that we have ever seen on the big screen. \n\nThe film's plot is with the help of allies Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Batman (Christian Bale) has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City. But when a vile young criminal calling himself the Joker (Heath Ledger) suddenly throws the town into chaos, the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and vigilantism. This two Academy Awards winner has brilliant acting, brilliant sound mixing/editing, brilliant visual effects and cinematography and astounding acting and the best score that I have ever seen in a movie that was done by Hans Zimmer. How Christopher handled the Joker was so brilliant and even the cast was afraid of him. \n\nHeath Ledger acted like he was the real life Joker because he put so much hard work into this role. To make himself ready for the role he locked himself in a hotel room for a month. The scene when he blew up the hospital was real and he done it at the wrong time to make himself even more psychotic. In the interrogation scene Heath asked Christian if he could beat him up and he did which made this scene truly remembered by everyone. Heath Ledger hated using visual effects so some of the film wasn't CGI which made it much better. \nEverything about this movie is done so well and is 'THE BEST COMIC BOOK MOVIE OF ALL TIMES'. \nThis is the best movie of the 2000s and is the best movie ever. \nGrade X (Higher than A+)",

Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Morgan Freeman all shone in the film. But of course, the real star was Heath Ledger (RIP) as the Joker, who truly deserved his Oscar win. Along with Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's music, Wally Pfister's cinematography, Lee Smith's editing, Nolan and his brother, Jonathan Nolan's screenplay, this film is already a classic.\nIt isn't just a typical Batman film. The way the film depicts crime, and how the characters choose to face these problems in Gotham, shows that the film is on a different level when compared to every single other comic book movie. Even the other instalments of its trilogy can't reach its level of quality.\nThe film is definitely a must-see every year.",

What makes this movie good? Acting yes, story yes, characters yes, music yes. This movie is not full of cgi. It's gritty, loud, dramatic and tense. Batman is dark and dense and complex.\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan may have created quite possibly one of my favourite trilogies. Christian Bale teeters between the pschopathic Batman and self absorbed, silverspooned richboy with ease. Heath Leger's Joker is simply genius. Maggie Gyllenhaal is tough and sexy.\n\nI wanted to test my sound system after a few tweaks. Man, didn't deliver! We get flooded with Hollywood crap. This movie is NOT crap. Do yourself a favor throw in this DVD or Blu-ray and watch it again. Or if it's the first time prepare yourself. Turn up the volume, dim the lights, get some popcorn and let the best Batman and Joker entertain you for for the next 2 hours and 32 minutes. \nComing up next, Secretary starring Maggie Gyllenhaal then American Pycho starring Christian Bale.",

            "content": "\"What the hell are you?\"\n\"I am Batman!\"\nThis line will surely go make a mark in Hollywood history! Christopher Nolan, the director of the critically acclaimed movie INSOMNIA, unleashes his version of BATMAN, which I should say is the closest to the comics after the treatment Tim Burton gave to the character.\n After the release of the first pictures of the Batman costume, (Thank god it was without the Bat-nipples) and the heavy duty model of the Bat-mobile (which again was a refreshing change from the sleek Bat-mobile) the world was pretty excited about what seemed to be a more dark, hard gritted take on the character. Fortunately, Mr. Nolan does not disappoint at all.\nWe get to see a perfect origin story of Bruce Wayne starting from the day of his parents' death until the day he finally dons the costume. We see him working with criminals to study their mind eventually meeting Alan Ducard (Ra's Al Ghul) brilliantly played by the versatile actor Liam Neeson who trains Bruce Wayne to be the Dark Knight with his own evil plan in mind. The training justifies the fighting methods of Batman in the movie, which is actually inspired by Ninja fighting skills.\nReturning home, we meet Bruce Wayne's loyal and the most trusted friend Alfred portrayed by Micheal Caine which makes a good father figure for him with his witty advices. \nWe see Gary Oldman playing Jim Gordon, Gotham City's Police Commissioner and another ally of Batman. Talking about the characters of the movie, all of them fit really well in the movie. Be it, the scarecrow, who actually gives some jumps during his tenure in the movie, or Ra's Al Ghul; talking about endurance to Bruce Wayne or Alfred asking \"WHY DO WE FALL?\", all of them are near to perfection.\nThe movie itself has some nice thrills, for say, the entry of BATMAN, actually creating fear and panic for the villains. The fantastic monster Bat-mobile chase scene along with the background score of Hanz Zimmer is one which will be played by people driving at top speeds for years to come! Now that I did mention about the background score, Hanz Zimmer is almost half-responsible for creating this perfect image of the dark Batman with the music he gave! \nSpecial mention to Morgan Freeman a.k.a, Lucius Fox, takes the mantle of the technical support for Batman. We see him explaining the suits, the weapons and my God, the Bat-mobile in a thunderous scene.\nSomething that did not add up was the inclusion of Katie Holmes. I found her an alien being in the whole movie, though she does her best.\nSo, go ahead and check out the guy who is flying on rooftops and you will be left craving for more because at the end we see what's coming next!",

The Joker/Harvey Dent storyline of the film symbolises the fall of a great man and this classic plot is portrayed perfectly in the film.\n\nOverall, The Dark Knight is possibly one of the most important films in recent times, it has revolutionary special effects and performances and has a lasting effect on the superhero genre as a whole, with films becoming darker after it's release.",

Do I like the character?  Yes.  Do I think he was played as he should have been? ...Maybe.  To have him talk in a falsetto-ish cant the entire time...wouldn't it have been better for him to work into it?\n\nE.g. when he is talking to Rachel, at first sound like a normal-ish person (without the falsetto lilt) but when he starts trying to tell her where he got his scars, having his voice gradually pitch up an octave would have scared the crap out of the audience, and had their tension rise with the scene.\n\nOtherwise, the late Heath did a phenomenal job with portraying a mental illness sufferer, with the licking of the lips (common for people who get off certain anti-psychotics) and general quirks (makeup on the hands in the Batman interrogation at the police station interrogation scene).\n\nStill the best superhero movie ever made...since Batman Begins....Ha ha ha...",

Christian Bale is great as always, but the late Heath Ledgers Joker steals show with his wonderful acting. If you have not seen this movie do yourself a favor and watch it. It is probably one of the top 5 movies of all time. NOT AN EXAGGERATION!!!",

Di sicuro che entra di diritto nei miei film preferiti. \u00c8 tutto perfetto, bellissimo, Nolan ha girato un qualcosa di spettacolare e senza ombra di dubbio uno dei migliori cinecomic di sempre. Ho preferito ovviamente questo al primo, soprattutto per il villain, Joker, interpretato da un magistrale Heath Ledger. Ogni volta che era scena oscurava qualunque personaggio, anche Batman, e durante tutto il film non aspettavo altro che le sue scene. E la pellicola inizia proprio con una sua scena, quella della rapina in banca e da l\u00ec il resto \u00e8 storia. Veramente pazzesco e Oscar strameritato. Per non parlare del doppiaggio che \u00e8 stato fatto in maniera divina. Bale \u00e8 sempre un ottimo Batman e pi\u00f9 che perfetto per il ruolo e grazie a Dio \u00e8 stata cambiata l'attrice di Rachel, questa volta interpretata da Maggie Gyllenhaal.\nFotografia e trucchi fantastici, realizzati benissimo; le musiche bellissime e come nel precedente film giustissime per ogni scena. Bellissimo, stupendo, perfetto, non so cosa dire, l'ho amato.",

What a fantastic story. \nDark in the perfect way. \nI'm not sure why they replaced Katie Holmes in this movie (from Batman Begins) but, Maggie Gyllenhaal did a stellar job. Perhaps better than Miss Holmes did, who did fine herself.\nNow the first film, Batman Begins, was a great film, I loved it. Every moment. A great origin story for Batman. Yet, The Dark Knight still managed to knock it out of the park. Just a whole other level. \nI had to give this 5 Stars because I really enjoyed the whole ride, was in disbelief in many moments and once it was over, I couldn't pick it apart. \nI was going to give it 4.5 but, I couldn't think of a reason to Not give that last half-star. Was it a perfect movie? \nIt sure as hell wasnt missing anything.",

            "content": "In light of its 10 year release anniversary, The Dark Knight demanded to be paid homage. Christopher Nolan's take on the Batman legacy created a work difficult to surpass; and the crowds agree. Even though it is a superhero movie at its base, there was nothing simple about this picture or even comparable to past movies of its kind. The effects and visuals were grandiose and the fight scenes were intense. Moments of deep thought by the batman were portrayed by his standing at the top of a skyscraper alone. Fight scenes were all-incorporating as buildings collapsed, autos were involved, weapons, and even hand to hand combat. Fortunately, there were no 'booms' or 'pows' as in the original batman.\nHans Zimmer's soundtrack was superb; highlighting the emotions of each scene and character. The music turned to noise when there would be mental commotion, and beautiful melodies arrived when the most honorable and loyal parts of batman's character were portrayed. Never did I catch the music take away from the film, but only contribute to the emotions which should be felt in each scene. \nThis was a new type of superhero movie. For example, Batman is faced with an opponent who becomes overwhelming. He must rely on his peers, super cool weapons, and brute strength to fight his opponent. We have seen these aspects in past superhero movies. What was different about this movie was how Batman was not untouched and he did not end up as the \"knight in shining armor.\" From the villain's perspective, the film became very poetic as it delved into the deeper parts of the Joker. We learn why he became who he was, and how he and Batman \"needed\" each other. So many supporting actors, one played by Morgan Freeman, acted as Batman's foundation as he traversed such a mentally and physically taxing trial; losing loved ones as he had in the past, deciding who would live and who would die, and avoiding the joker get inside his head. \nThe star-studded cast worked seamlessly as they interacted and developed their characters. In addition to these great performances, Heath Ledger's Joker was all-time. Words truly cannot describe how deeply his role was felt and how he relayed the joker's diabolical nature to the viewer. He truly assumed this role and turned it into something infamous which couldn't be contained by the movie's running time. As a viewer, you return to your daily activities, plagued by visions of the disturbed personality. The rotten and psycopthic thought processes continue to develop in your mind as you try to process how the joker and his men were able to scheme what they did. The complexity of the plot and all the twists really leaves the viewer asking questions that could never be answered. The joker constantly has you guessing what he is going to do next while simultaneously trying to figure out how he just did what he did. He is so divisive in plotting people against each other to prove just how dark the human race really is all on its own. He keeps himself out of these situations to make people choose. At the pinnacle of the movie, batman is left with a choice, which choice leaves the viewer thinking, and hoping to see more. \nThis is a must-see movie and truly a basis for all superhero movies created since. Christopher Nolan outdid himself with this one. The only regrettable part of this movie is the bar was set so high. Superhero movies will never be the same.",

            "content": "It's 1981. I walk in to QuikTrip, a convenience store in the Midwest, in this case Broken Arrow, OK. I fumble through my allowance, trying to find out if I want a 3 Musketeers bar, a Twix bar or a made-by-me sundae from the soft serve ice cream bar. I'm bored with all that stuff, I tell myself. And I drift over to the comic book rack. I've never read one, except maybe for an occasional Richie Rich, Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry one. I find a rather odd book from DC Comics called Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew. #1. It's a collector's item! Aren't they all?\n\nI buy it. I read it. A gazillion times. I love it. But it doesn't translate into other additional comic book purchases, at least for another year or so. No, I was too busy pumping my allowance into Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nFast forward to 1982...maybe 1983. I walk into a Walgreens in Sunrise, FL. (I got around quite a bit as a kid). I buy a DC Comics issue of Brave and the Bold. It's a \"team-up\" comic, which featured, in this case, Batman and Ragman. Yes...Ragman. I read it. A gazillion times. Again...no translation into additional comic book purchases though.\n\nFast forward even more to later in 1983. I walk into a 7-Eleven in Thousand Oaks, CA (see what I mean...I got around...cross country this time) with my allowance. Still struggling to define the merits of one calorie-laden candy bar over another. And out of the corner of my eye, I locate the Avengers. I buy it. I read it. A gazillion times. This time, I'm hooked. Yeah, maybe I'm a little slow, but I finally realize that I like these little things.\n\nObsessively, comic books consume my life from 6th grade until early high school, when girls took over my interests. During that span of time, Daredevil met Elektra. Superman was rebooted John Byrne style. Mike Zeck introduced the black Spider-Man costume that would eventually become Venom. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles came out of their shell. Alan Moore made sure adults would read comics too with Watchmen. And Frank Miller redefined Batman, and comic book writing, with the The Dark Knight Returns.\n\nI was done with comics when all of the above ensured that prices outlasted the paltry allowance of an early teen. I just couldn't afford to continue. It didn't stop me from being interested when Batman, from Tim Burton, Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, came out. It looked dark. Not Frank Miller/Dark Knight Returns dark, but dark. It was outstanding, at the time. It was the best anyone had, and could have, done. And it became a joke of a franchise.\n\nThen came Batman Begins. I saw it the day it came out in 2005. I was absolutely blown away. I still think it's the best comic book movie ever made. The film snapped in the middle of the presentation. I waited for an hour or so to get into another showing so I could finish watching. And at the end, when they alluded to the Joker being the next villain, I was salivating.\n\nAnd then came The Dark Knight.\n\nI was a bit confused when I heard that the title would be The Dark Knight.\nI know Batman had been called that for a long time, but I guess I equated it to Frank Miller's story. Also, the choice of Heath Ledger didn't fill me with a lot of confidence. I mean, I liked him, but I had Johnny Depp in my mind as a good Joker.\n\nWas I wrong...\n\nThis movie was appropriately titled, but it could have easily been called The Joker. The movie was entirely about, orchestrated and scene stolen by Heath Ledger's absolutely flawless portrayal of Clown Prince of Crime.\n\nI winced too when I heard early buzz about The Dark Knight. One, I didn't want to get too hyped about it because it would not have been able to meet my expectations and, in some ways, it didn't. However, I really hated the talk of Heath getting Oscar mentions. Everyone knows that those kinds of things are randomly leaked to create buzz, plus the added death of Ledger only exacerbated the talk.\n\nI have to say though...I saw The Dark Knight twice. I had to, apparently. No, not because it was \"the thing to do.\" I had to because I clearly missed some things in the first showing.\n\nFirst things first...The Dark Knight is a very different movie from Batman Begins. This shocked me. Batman Begins flowed so perfectly that I thought, at the very least, it would be a smooth movie. It was far from it. The beginning was a little slow starting, but at the same time it had to set up so much of what the whole movie was about, and the length of the movie was already too long, the result was a very choppy, seemingly poorly edited movie. I was stunned by this. When I saw it a second time, I didn't get it as much, and when I go see it in Imax next week, it may flow even better. But Batman Begins was perfect the first (full) time I saw it, so this cut seemed rather messy to me. I'm curious if there will be a different, extended cut of the film on Blu Ray that may make it go more smoothly.\n\nNevertheless, it is a nonstop roller coaster ride of a movie (how cliche is that??).\n\nLet's talk comics.\n\nJoker has never had a fully established origin. It's curious to point out that nearly every writer who takes him on as a character takes past origins and adds to them, subtracts some, etc. And all the changes are from his perspective. As though HE changes his origin. That is why the \"Jack Napier\" character in Tim Burton's Batman now looks to be pretty stupid, especially the completely fabricated component that The Joker killed Batman's parents. I never liked that.\n\nNeedless to say, I was SO happy to see David Goyer and Christopher Nolan treat Joker the traditional way. No matching prints, no names, no aliases, an ever-changing explanation of his scars, etc. From a comic book character-to-screen portrayal, it was absolutely perfect.\n\nWhat is overlooked many times in these two movies, compared to the campy Batman franchise from 1989-1997, is that Christopher Nolan hates CGI. He believes Batman is a human trying to be more than human, which is true to the comics, and that the portrayal of him should be very human as well. From straight combat, to references to real military equipment, to the scars and bruises on his body, Batman is as real as he can possibly be. That is why, when he thinks he has the \"typical Gotham criminal\" pretty sized up on how to handle them, it was very human to admit that he didn't see a criminal with the complete chaotic, insane, without-a-weakness criminal coming. Joker outplayed Batman throughout the whole movie, which was absolutely perfect. He made Batman a better hero, a better detective. This movie is just as much about Batman's growth as Gotham's Dark Knight as it is about the impact Joker has on everything in sight.\n\nIt was also human, as well as tightly tied to the Batman Begins story, that Bruce wanted to inspire fear in the hearts of Gotham's criminals while, at the same time, inspiring strength in the people of Gotham to take over their city, and that humanity saw given hope when Harvey Dent entered the picture. He and Bruce shared the goal of a stronger, people-run Gotham, only he did it legally and in public. He was definitely Gotham's White Knight. Throughout most of the movie, I understood (at least I thought I did) the contrast between Batman's Dark Knight and Harvey's \"White Knight.\" Batman had to be dark and fearful to rattle the cages and inspire change. Harvey had to be the white knight so that, as Bruce alluded to in the movie, Batman could slip back into the shadows while the people of Gotham finished what Batman had begun.\n\nAnd in yet another show of humanity, the Joker exploits every single person in the movie for his own amusement to prove that no matter how admirable Batman and Harvey's efforts were, they were all corruptable. Joker thought the pursuit of law and order was, itself, the big joke. And Joker had every intention of delivering the punchline.\n\nIn the end, Joker was right. Harvey, after losing his beloved Rachel Dawes, played by the wooden Maggie Gyllenhall (my only real complaint of the movie), plays right into the Joker's plan and shows his \"other side\" (Ugh...I'm sorry...I even had trouble typing that one) by killing a few traitors and kidnapping Gordon's family.\n\nThe movie was pure chaos from minute one, with the Joker the only one capable of keeping his finger on the pulse. The anarchy, combined with the history of the Joker character and Ledger's flawless performance, made for a movie that absolutely delivered the goods. No one could have done it better.\n\nThe end, when, in yet another humanity-laden theme, Batman realizes Harvey wasn't perfect, but that he represented the closest thing to perfection Gotham had in years. His \"legend\" needed to continue so that Batman's vision could be realized. And, as all good heroes do, he sacrificed his already-damaged reputation as a vigilante so that Harvey's legacy, and Gotham's path, could continue. He had to be the true DARK KNIGHT to Harvey's White Knight. He would continue fighting as a vigilante, but he would also have to now linger in the shadows even more so that another person would step in one day where Harvey left.\n\nI ranked the movie a 9 out of 10, one rank short of the 10 out of 10 I gave Batman Begins, because of some very small, seemingly insignificant problems I had with the movie. One, it was too choppy during the first 30-45 minutes. Again, maybe I will grow out of that, but I stand by it at this writing. Two, Maggie G sucked. She is just unappealing in every way and was absolutely the wrong choice for this movie. Third, I, like most of America, are a little irritated with Christian Bale's Batman voice. In the first movie, I liked it. Especially in his first battle scene as Batman. It worked, while making me giggle...just a little. However, in The Dark Knight, it was too much. I get that he has to instill fear, so that has to be over the top, plus he has to completely differentiate Batman from Bruce and this \"character\" was it. It just seemed to be a bit much in The Dark Knight. And if something like that makes the audience giggle or wince, it's not working.\n\nAll in all, though, The Dark Knight was near-perfection. I would hate to be Christopher Nolan and David Goyer. It's going to take Johnny Depp as The Riddler and Angelina Jolie as Catwoman to even get close to amount of interest The Dark Knight stirred. I doubt anything else will ever come close to $471 million in 5 weeks and the #2 all-time highest grossing film. The stars (pardon the pun) were aligned for this one. It hurts that Ledger died, but what a way to go...",

While Caesar Romero gave us the original antagonist to Adam West's Batman and Mark Hamill is beyond a doubt THE VOICE of the Joker, Ledger delved into deep psychological waters to give a performance that scared everyone on set during filming.  His slinking body language, his painted facial expression and gravely voice made what this film is to many Joker fans, the pinnacle of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy.  The quick cuts, the labyrinth of plot twists and even the infra-sound keeps returning audiences on their toes.  The only bad thing about this film is the fact that Ledger died during post-production.  Thus, never giving us the added villainy of The Dark Knight Rises but also robbing us of Ledger's chance to deliver the one line that epitomizes the Joker's relationship with Batman; \"Without Batman, crime has no punchline.\"",

Additionally, Nolan made the risky yet brilliant idea to use IMAX to shoot most of the film.

Moreover, one cannot view this film without noticing the sheer perfection that was Ledger's Joker. He was able to make every scene humorous and entertaining yet also profoundly unsettling.

            "content": "One of the best, undeniably enduring superhero films that does more than most others.\n\nChristian Bale returns to the role of Batman, Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel Dawes (played by Katie Holmes in Batman Begins), and Brokeback Mountain star Heath Ledger dons the ghoulishly gleeful Joker makeup previously worn by Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero. Just as it begins to appear as if Batman, Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), and District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) are making headway in their tireless battle against the criminal element, a maniacal, wisecracking fiend plunges the streets of Gotham City into complete chaos.\n\nThe sequel to \"Batman Begins\", \"The Dark Knight\" faces one of the greatest super villains in the history of comics paired with potentially the greatest super villain performance we've ever seen. I mean, this film has a couple of flaws for sure, but it's so awesome I don't really know where to begin. Not only is this one of my favorite superhero films, but it genuinely does so many things right that you just can't help but admire what Nolan did here. \n\nOne thing I love about this film are the characters. Let's talk about The Joker because that's an obvious one. Heath Ledger puts on a scary and extremely memorable performance as The Joker. At this point, it's hard to say it's overrated or talked about too much but his performance is one for the ages. I'm really bummed out about his passing (not recent), but he certainly leaves us with a performance we don't deserve. Christian Bale continues a strong performance as Batman, and Aaron Eckhart really puts in a top notch performance. Maggie Gyllenhaal does a good job as a replacement and the rest of the cast seemingly performs up to par. This film has a great cast led by Heath Ledger and even if you don't like this film, you can't deny the performances are great. \n\nThe entire concept and conflict here is so well done. The reason why The Joker is so amazing also relies on the fact that he tries to strip Batman's one moral. It becomes this psychological battle throughout the entire film and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The action sequences are well done and throughout the entire film, you always feel uneasy because of the conflict they've created. It's an external struggle and an internal battle and it all shows up so well on screen.\n\nWhat I really love about Nolan's trilogy so far is that he does a great job of world building. Gotham is a city in shambles and you constantly feel like anything can happen. There's thrills around every corner and the I love the suspense he's able to build throughout. You feel like the world is so well established and I love all the little elements that shows you the current condition of the city. Whether it's the imitation Batman's running around, the corrupt personnel in every corner, or just the dire nature of the city, everything comes together so well. \n\nThe screenplay is also really well written. For a film that has a decently long runtime, it never feels too long. Unlikes some blockbusters these days, the film was allowed to have a longer runtime and build up the world around Batman. It was allowed to explore the characters and bring us a brilliantly constructed narrative without feeling rushed. I feel like I'm constantly on my toes and wanting to see what happens next, while still being astonished and a little frightened by the severity of the events. It's so amazing what this film accomplishes psychologically and it also shows that superhero films can be dark, but still find success.\n\nIn the end, this is easily one of the best superhero films out there and continues a run of great art pieces from Nolan.",

The film itself is one that works as a pop-culture comic book flick and a dark bruiting crime drama that's tense throughout, with that underlying feeling of never knowing when and where the Joker will strike next. It's also a Batman movie where Bruce's Bat is not nearly as unstoppable when it comes to protecting Gotham, but rather innocent lives can't be saved since the hero can only do so much. That vulnerability element is what makes this one of the most, if not the most, intriguing super hero films to date.

Building on Batman Begins, Chris Nolan takes the concept of Batman in a realistic world to the next level with this excellent sequel. No more plaudits are needed to describe Heath Ledger's Joker. An iconic portrayal of a loved villain that has had a transcendent effect on the character in the comics since, and looms large over anyone who dares put on the make-up and purple jacket on screen- perhaps only Mark Hamill's voicework on the animated series holds up to Ledger. An almost perfect film, several flaws unfortunately means it does come short of 5 Star, for example, there are one or two plot jumps that don't make sense (what happened to the Joker and Harvey Dent after Batman saved Rachel atthe dinner party?) and the boat scene which halts the pace of the film dead in its tracks (kill your darlings strikes again). That said, this film could not be any cooler and I've seen it countless times. People mock Christian Bale's gravely Batman voice but everyone at some point has snarled \"I'M BATMAN!!\" in its wake. Again, Han's Zimmer's score turns every emotion up to 11. Buy this on BLU-RAY so you can watch this again and again and again.",

            "content": "The Dark Knight? Or the Joker show? \n\t\nHeath Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight made what would have been a good movie into what is now, and forever will be a great movie. His performance as the Joker was a phenomenal, one of a kind performance that could not have been acted any better than what was displayed in The Dark Knight. It still pains me today that The Dark Knight was Heath Ledgers last film before he passed away, but boy did he end on an amazing performance. He deservedly was awarded an Oscar for Bests Supporting Actor in 2009 after he had passed away, adding on to his amazing legacy. Heath was the star of the show, even ironically enough over Christian Bale, the Batman, in which the movie is named after. \n\nThe Joker was the definition of pure evil causing mayhem through Gotham city. He ran around the city with his purple suit and white and red face paint doing all kinds of terrible things. To name only a few of those things, the Joker went from robbing banks, to slamming a pencil through some one's head, to making videos of him torturing civilians, to bombing a hospital, to planting bombs on boats, to almost anything you could think of. Even the creepy way that he would share how he got the horrific scars on his face as he would quickly lick his lips would give me the chills. Because of his performance the 2 and a half hour movie of action packed excitement still had me wanting more when it came to an end. \n\nThe Influence that the Joker had in the movie was mind boggling. Literally everyone in Gotham city was affected by the Jokers motives to create havoc. After the Joker received stacks on stacks of cash that he and the mobs had stolen he put all that money in a huge pile, poured gasoline on it, and burned it to ashes.  The Joker was the kind of villain that didn't care about worldly things such as riches or power; he didn't care if he was well known. There was only one thing on his mind, and Alfred Pennyworth described him perfectly in the movie. Comparing the Joker to another man that he had come across in Burma, he said about the Joker, \"Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.\" That's all it came down to with the Joker, the only incentive and sense of accomplishment that he felt, came when he saw the world burn.  \n\nThe Joker had not limits. He loved playing sick twisted \"games\" with the civilians in Gotham just to watch people suffer. There are many scenes in the movie that displays the Jokers insanity but one specific scene really puts it all in a nut shell. As the people were evacuating Gotham the Joker planted bombs onto two boats. One of the boats was filled with convicts from the prison and the other was filled with average civilians. Instead of just blowing the boats up himself he allowed the people to do it. He put a detonator on each boat that detonated the bomb to the other boat, and told them if they didn't blow up the other boat before midnight then they would all die. Instead of easily killing all the people in those two boats the Joker enjoyed bringing others down with them. He didn't want to be the only one \"having the fun\" so in an evil twisted way he involved others in helping him inflict pain and cause mayhem in the city of Gotham.   \nHeath Ledger's performance of the Joker will go down as one of the best acted villains of all time. The way Heath Ledger acted the Joker was admirable. There are not enough words to describe all that he did for The Dark Knight and the movie industry in general. He has left his mark in a big way. Heath Ledgers legacy will forever live on.",

The Joker is no demon, god, or unstoppable creature, but a vulnerable, human vehicle for chaos, anarchy, and terror. Heath Ledger's Joker is hands down the greatest performance of the decade and--arguably--of all time. A film (and trilogy) that must be puzzling to next gen DC fans because it's not an awful Marvel knockoff like Justice League, Suicide Squad, or any other current projects.",

            "content": "CRIME THRILLER AND DARK FUN. SO WATCH IT NOW.Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy \"The Dark Knight\" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the \"damsel-in-distress\" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than \"Begins\" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.\n\nSimply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than \"Begins.\" The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet. But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' MASTERPIECE of a superhero film. To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'. While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the viewer's interest. And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too. But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down to the cast. Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose it's pretty appropriate. Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? But...well...how can I put it...? It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just looks...well...lame. If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment. Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks. As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you get the idea. Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz. Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK. Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular talent. Go Gaz. Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister! The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and action. I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman &",

            "content": "Debunking the Batman \n\tThe movie that I will be evaluating is \"The Dark Knight\", the second in the Batman trilogy directed by Christopher Nolan. This film breaks the standard formula of the traditional superhero movie, which would contain a black and white morality system and a clean resolution. Batman, also known as \"the Dark Knight\", may be this movie's protagonist, but he does not fully embody the typical image of what a superhero should be. For example, throughout the movie, he engages in a lot of internal conflict due to fact that he knows he cannot be the Batman forever, and needs to find a successor. During the events of the movie, the people of Gotham now look at Batman as a hero who has failed to save them time and time again due to the Joker's machinations. These serve to present Batman as more human, with his own share of troubles and doubts that make it easier for the audience to relate to him.\n\tThe movie's main antagonist, and the one driving most of the plot, is the Joker, played by Heath Ledger. His manic personality and unpredictable actions present him as suitably unhinged and, appropriately terrifying. What sets the Joker apart from other villains is his near Machiavellian plans that, to everyone else, seem like nothing more than random and chaotic actions , making him unpredictable and \u00a0almost impossible to stop. Ledger does an amazing job portraying the sheer insanity that is the Joker, and his outstanding portrayal of the maniac clown brings the character to horrifying life. The Joker's chaotic intelligence makes him a perfect match for Batman.\n\tThe overall mood of this movie is very dark, and an unbelievable amount of action and suspense is packed into every minute of the two and a half hour running time. Some may find this exhausting, as there is not much room for a breather, and a lack in dialogue, considering the long running time. However, the dialogue that is present reveals a lot about each character and their motives. A lot of the decisions that the characters at first seem reckless or just wrong, but once you understand why they do it, you really discover a lot about who they are, and notice the complexity of each character. Any movie that contains complex characters has a lot going for it. The characters in this movie are what make this movie unique, and each time you watch it, you learn something new about each person. Some of the decisions and choices that Batman makes in the movie could even be relate back to real life situations that the everyday man faces, \u00a0in a much grittier context, of course. This is what makes the movie so good, because it is packed with action and amazing special effects, but also features real people, with real decisions, and real problems. \n\tIn conclusion, I think that this movie is definitely worth seeing, and should be on everyone's list of favorites. It has something that could appeal to every type of audience member, and can even relate to people in some parts. It is packed with thrilling scenes, amazing special effects, one of a kind costumes, and complex characters. I believe this movie deserves a very high Rotten Tomatoes score, nearly perfect. A movie that finds success in all of these categories is hard to come by, and should be appreciated and praised to no end.",

Then there's the Joker. Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances in the history of cinema. His interpretation of the Clown Prince of Crime greatly surpasses Jack Nicholson's legendary turn as the same character. Every single scene he's in is made better because of it. The best part of The Dark Knight is that if someone besides Ledger had been cast as The Joker, the film's quality would barely go down, and it would still be one of the best superhero movies ever, just maybe not #2.

            "content": "One of the most overrated movies of all time and proof that human beings are dumb sheep. Heath Ledger wasn't scary at all. People just felt bad because he died young so they overreacted by giving him an Academy Award. Chris Nolan cannot film a good action sequence at all. The fight scenes are just garbage. The fight choreography is terrible and Batman looks so slow and lame in his fight scenes - even after he switches to his lighter armor. Everything in this movie sucked -- literally everything. I laughed out loud at Bale's unintentionally funny Batman voice -- that ridiculous growly voice that's supposed to be intimidating but is comical instead.\n\nThis whole stupid movie is based on one stupid idea: you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.   The plot is just one big, dumb, elaborate contrivance with the goal of shoehorning Batman into the role of the villain.  To that end, the writers make Batman the bad guy in the end because, according to them, the entire population of Gotham is so enamored of Harvey Dent that they just wouldn't be able to handle that he became a bad guy -- Gotham would just be completely devastated and demoralized if they found out Dent became a killer. What a joke. Nobody cares who the district attorney is in their city. They're not revered as heroes -- that's preposterous. I'll bet most people can't even name the district attorney in their city. Athletes, rappers, pop stars, actors -- they are idolized by the dull masses, not district attorneys. If the district attorney in your city was convicted of a heinous crime, I'll bet you wouldn't lose all hope in humanity and be completely demoralized and broken. That's just stupid.\n\nAlso, why don't you go find some old people and spit at them.  Yeah, that's right.  Go to the old folks home and spit in some old people's faces.  Excoriate them and call them villains.  If security or the cops show up and ask you what the hell you're doing, tell them that this dumb overrated movie told you that people either die heroes or they live long enough to become villains.  Hey, do you have elderly parents or grandparents?  Well, I guess they're villains, right?  Hey, do you think you'll ever grow old -- like ninety or one hundred years old?  I guess you'll be a villain, too.  Even if you've never committed any crimes and led a decent life -- it won't matter -- you'll be a villain too, according to this dumb movie.\n\nFinally, Batman fans often say that Batman can beat any super villain or hero if he has time to prepare, but they should consider that he had the whole damn movie to prepare for Joker and Two Face, two non-super-powered villains, and they make him out to be a total chump. Additionally, this movie shows Batman getting his weak, slow ass owned by a couple of mere dogs. How can Batman beat any super villain or super hero when he can't even handle a couple of canines? Batman is just weak and dumb in this horrible movie. Should've named the movie \"The Weak, Dumb Knight\" or \"The Weak, Slow, Dumb Chump.\" Or \"The Weak, Slow, Dumb Chump Who Tries to Sound Scary by Making His Voice All Growly.\" Thanks for nothing Chris Nolan.",

            "content": "As we all know by now, Christopher Nolan is a dominant name in the modern filmmaking. His films combine all the elements in filmmaking such as complex storytelling, brilliant cinematography, and stunning practice action sequences. Nolan's name has been around Hollywood before 2008, but The Dark Knight has driven his name to the top level of filmmakers, and since then he can do whatever he wants.\n\nDuring the 2000s, superhero movies are becoming the new money-making machine for major studios. However, there was an up-and-down in this genre. When Batman Begins was released, the world met the new approach to this genre. However, the true game-changer that provides the new perspective and new definition of the superhero genre is The Dark Knight. Everything that we believe has changed forever, and it has become the new highest standard in this genre. There are few movies that ever come this close, including Batman Begins, The Dark Knight Rises, and Logan.\n\nThe plot of this film is unbelievably complex and realistic. During that time, none of the superhero films have this kind of story, and their plot is very straightforward. However, Nolan took it to the whole new level by taking out unnecessary subjects that could ruin the movie and replace them with a darker tone, more realistic elements, and complex characters. He testifies the definition of hero by showing and letting the protagonists and antagonists do what is right and wrong in their perspectives, and the results might not be as we expected. By allowing them to come close to the line that divides them from one another, we can see how similar they are.\n\nBatman is a character from the comic as well as others in this film, but all the characters are realistic as hell. Their motivation is legit and their standpoints are clear. The Joker is the energy behind all characters. He tears the the heroes apart. He is the one who change Harvey Dent into evil of his own. He destroys Gotham's hope and convinces them that Batman is nothing but like him. In addition to Batman and the Joker, their relationship is very fascinating. Yes they are rival, but the bond they have throughout the entire runtimes is speechless. Without the Joker, Batman wouldn't be anything but just a guy in a dark costume. The same can be said to the Joker. He even says it himself that without Batman, his mission to terrorize the city would be useless if no one stand to protect it. Nolan makes us care more about the stories and motivations of people behind the masks as much as we care about them when they put the masks on.\n\nAll of the action sequences in Christopher Nolan's films look practical from every angle. In The Dark Knight, all action sequences are practical. Nolan uses as less as CGI as possible, for as we know the CGI can make the sequences less effective. The scenes with the truck, the exploding, and the hospital are real, which make them even more awesome when we know the facts.\n\nThe success of Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy is beyond any definition. Many movies try to follow his footsteps, especially DCEU and Zack Snyder. They try so hard to duplicate Nolan's works by making their new films more realistic and darker. However, none of them have received the same criticism as The Dark Knight Trilogy has. That is because it's not about how realistic the film is or how the tone is, but because of the structures, the story, and the scenes. Nolan understands this concept and masters his works while others who try to copy his works struggle.\n\nThere is nothing bad I could say regarding this film. Every single minute I invested into this film is full of excitement, amaze, and tears of joy. Christopher Nolan understands what it needs to be done. The Dark Knight is one of the most critically and commercially successful film. The film that is so perfect in every way possible. We can't even imagine how superhero of the other genres can surpass this madness.",

            "content": "Now I've been wanting to review this for a long time, The Dark Night has been and always been in my top 5 favorite films of all time, I love Batman even more, I love the Joker even more, and I'm in love with Christopher Nolan films and invested by what his next project because of this movie!! \n\nThe Dark Knight is directed by Christopher Nolan a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins, starring an ensemble cast including Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Morgan Freeman. \n\nThe Dark Knight did a lot of things right with the film, one, grounded the story with the Joker and Batman, two, confliction with Gotham city and Batman, three, drama and noir like base film, four, convert the story form Batman: The Long Halloween, Five casting Heath Ledger as the Joke, and making the Joker like Alex from Cockwork Orange from Stanley Kubrick, love it all the way.. \n\nBack in 2008, I was 14 years old soon to be starting my freshman year in high school, I was grounded for 3 week, the week before the film was released. I sacrifice on one thing and one thing only, staying in for three weeks in the summer, and not getting grounded to go see a movie or any television. So worth it!! First thing the Dark Knight, it was iconic before the movie was released because of Heath Ledgers death, and Rest In Peace to him!! But Christopher Nolan wises to the publicity I made such a cult classic film that is deserve to be talked about, and should've been Oscar praised on top of it!! \n\nJust of the begining of the film, it was a break robbery, no batman, no joker, just A bank robbery of jokers henchmen, as for the joker disguises with the henchmen is so eye popping then revealing of the joker was all the henchmen dead. Since I love clockwork Orange and is one of my favorite films and it is in the top 5 of my favorites, I see a lot of Alex in the film of the joker, but for the joker we see more of his mad humor, and his craziness with his own personality of the joker. \n\nWhat I love about Christopher Nolan films is that whatever genre it is, it is more of the humanistic of people. For the Following, A secret colt, Memento, disabilities and lies, Insomnia, lies and mental issues, the prestige, competition and revenge. The Dark Knight, \"You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain\". \"Some people want to see the world burn\".  These are the various quotes throughout the film. Burning or seen the hero become the villain. Good and bad bad versus evil. \n\nWhat I love about the beginning of the film but the show they original suit from Batman Begins, then 10 minutes later he wants a new suit so he could move his neck. Most of the Batman films they show new suits without even a constant change in the middle shows just the genius writing of Christopher Nolan. Because in every single Batman film from Tim Burton to Joel Shoemaker they always change the costumes!!! \n\nBut the joker is the iconic matter of the film, yes Two Face Harvey Dent is in the film, what is love about it that they made it so real. They really did show of harvey dent burn in half. For the Joker, he was not chemically induce his skin with acid, he simply cutt is face with a knife for a smile with war make up.. Genius!!! \n\nWhat I love about even more of a joker of the back stories the lies of back stories, One that his father cut his face and he became evil,  Two he cutt his face for his wife, like this is the thing in the comics for the joker we don't really know his backstory. And it just shows the genius of the writing for this film, and I love everything about it. \n\nJust the hospital scene with Harvey and the joker ?\"Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos... and then the blowup at the hospital is so iconic. \n\nI don't want to spoil the end because this is a required field that everyone needs to see!!! This is a requirement film to see, go see The Dark Knight, The best Christopher Nolan film ever put a date!! Seeing this in movie six times when it was first released was so worth it and I wish I had a higher grade because it is so good!! \n\nGrade: A Perfect 10",

There are many things going on in this movie and while it may seem like a bit much at times, the writers do a good job with connecting them all together.\n\nLet me just say that the acting in this movie is fantastic.

The downside to this film mainly has to do with Harvey Dent's subplot. I understand why he was an essential part of the overall story. However his descent into villainy was very rushed at the end and he ended up coming across as very whiny as opposed to menacing. Batman still sounds like he needs a lozenge. Unfortunately Bale wasn't given direction to change that ridiculous voice. 'The Dark Knight' may be the best live-action Batman film ever made (so far). I don't envy any future Batman films that try to best this one.",

And the last thing I likes is Two Face because he isn't black criminal,but he did bad things because he wants to revenge for his girlfriend.It's very good movie I ever seen and I think it will be the best movie forever.",

And now that I can fully comprehend the writing that brought Gotham to life and the utter experience that watching Heath Ledger's Joker brings, I can say this movie has secured itself in the top 10 of all time.\n[ANOTHER REWATCH in May 2022, fairly soon after a rewatch last year. Still a top 10 all-timer. The palpable sense of dread and anxiety as chaos seeps further and further into the heart of Gotham at every turn of Joker's plan...it's just masterful. These characters are challenged so deeply as their plunged into the most desperate, most trying of situations. So fascinating to see how that stains Gotham's White Knight in actuality but not in the eyes of the city and pollutes the public's perception of Batman because he knows--despite remaining steadfast to his cause--that the \"symbol\" and \"legend\" of the Batman can channel the disappointment, disdain, and disgust of the city so that they have room to find hope in each other and the city's officials.

One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it's not real, people don't dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don't name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.",

            "content": "A review of The Dark Knight, at long last. And here we..go:\nThe Dark Knight represents the pinnacle of superhero/comic book films. It's an amazing film thanks in large part to Christopher Nolan's direction ultimately improving over the already spectacular Batman Begins. There's never a dull moment, regardless of circumstances. Every actor does a great job of portraying the character. And what type of person would I be if I didn't acknowledge Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker? Every time the Joker is on screen, he never ceases to entertain because he's just a really great villain. May Heath Ledger rest in peace. Most people claim that is an epic crime thriller that just happens to have Batman in it and that's not even a bad thing. Well, guess what? I agree. The action is intense yet still awesome. Never has any one of Batman's personalised motorcycles, in this case entitled the Batpod, looked this inviting. The Dark Knight is one of those films in which the villain seems to gain a better advantage than the hero, in fact the most memorable lines come out of the Joker's mouth. It ends flawlessly. Not happy but flawless, in a way. Helps foreshadow a possible third part, which we got 4 years later with The Dark Knight Rises. I wonder if it's as bad as anything which isn't a review aggregator says it is. I'll probably disagree since the said review aggregators are some of my most trusted comrades. At least we'll always have this film. I'd definitely add this on my Top 10 list of comic book movies set outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Congratulations, Nolan.",

In my mind, there will never be a better Joker portrayal than the one he brought to this movie. Christian Bale is phenomenal once again as the dark knight himself, Batman, and great performances again from Michael Caine as Alfred and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. The script is fantastic while being gritty and dark, while having that sliver of light peeking through the darkness from time to time. A marvel of large scale comic films that will stand the test of time as one of the very best of its genre, and an incredible movie over all.",

This movie set the bar for special effects and how acting needs to be done. Actors Christian Bale (Batman) and Heath Ledger (Joker) took their acting careers to a whole new level. I also think that it adds to know that this was the last movie for Ledger due to his passing from prescription drugs.\n\nReading over all of the other critics and reviews that have been posted before mine, I can see that I am not the only person that feels this way.

Christopher Nolan in my opinion has never made a bad film,  Nolan has created a dark, creepy Gotham City where anarchy reigns and justice is corrupt.\nBatman Begins was a very dark and gritty movie however this sequel is far supirior and supasses the first in everyway.\nChristian Bale returns to play the part of Batman, which he does flawlessly, for me he is my favourite actor who has ever played the role, come on i wasnt going to pick Clooney was i?\nThe Dark Knight movie is kinda more based on the graphic novels which i find brilliant, Warner Bros facilitating to an older audience was the correct move to make.\nNow, Heath Leger makes the character The Joker his own, every little subtle thing that he does to make The character come to life is genius, from the way he speaks, to the slight toungue movement tic, to the way he walks. \nHes like a twisted Kurt Cobain, tourmented, troubled.However he also makes The Joker a very likable character, the scene where he was dressed as a nurse was brilliant!\n He definatly steals the show from all of the solid cast members.\nLedger is simply the greatest Joker of all time fact!\nHowever believe it or not the main story isnt about The Joker, no, well for me It was the rise and fall of Harvey Dent played by Aaron Eckhart. Throw in a love triangle as well and youve got a great story to tell. \nMichael Caine's plays the ever so loyal butler Alfred, he has the wisdom of a battle veteran and cares for Bruce like he would if he was his own son and for me was casted perfectly. \nI have only one flaw in this movie which is the re-casting of Rachel, not sure why this had to happen, but it did, in doing so this would of scored the perfect 10, but i gave it 9 1/2 out of 10.",

While that is indeed the highlight of the movie, the truly effective attributes are the subtleties in the background. The cinematography in this film is wonderful, a constant movement of the camera gives it a feel of naturalism. It's also very impressive how they kept this feature subtle, never moving to the point of distraction. Character intent is also done brilliantly through visual and auditorial hints. In the scene where Gordon enters Dent's office, there is no chair on the opposite of the desk. This showcases Dent's inability to face problems and his distaste for opinion based justice, favouring instead what's 'fair.' The score also adds to the naturalistic feel of the film, by using a lot of minimalistic music, it gives just the right amount to trigger the audience's emotion and therefore involvement. So while all the technical aspects are wonderful, how does the acting hold up. Well, Heath Ledger bathes in everything that makes the Joker who he is, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman both understand their place as the emotional anchors that keep Bruce down and Aaron Eckhart does a good job of playing the Harvey part of Two-Face. Unfortunately, Christian Bale, with his utterly ridiculous voice, and unemotional portrayal of Bruce Wayne does let it down a little, The writing also seems to misunderstand the character of Two-Face, in the way that they forget he is psychologically Two-Faced, the real base of his character. Despite these problems, The Dark Knight is still an incredibly involving and powerful movie, and the best Batman has to offer.",

The slight twist of \"why so serious?\" Just adds to the complexity and keeps you at the edge of your seat. In my opinion the joker in general is the best character ever created and deserves his own movie. Jared Leto had a hard time living up to the hype of Heath ledger and that's because he just wasn't as good. This movie deserves all good ratings and I have literally never met someone who didn't enjoy every aspect of the movie.

I absolutely love everything about this film, the acting is amazing, Heath Ledger absolutely tears the screen in half in his role, upending amazing performances by Cristina Bale and Aaron Eckharts best acting performance in his lifetime so far in my opinion. The film isn't so much an action movie as it is a drama, a crime drama more specifically, with some amazing action scenes. Nolan moves the camera in such great ways that the camerawork alone is what makes some of the scenes, combined with Ledgers Joker in the same scene, it's about as great as one can imagine a Nolan movie being. There are so many different themes in this film, and they all are fully realized and make the movie even better because of it. Great dialogue is in here as well, this is especially obvious in the interrogation scene with the Joker and Batman in a battle of wits, which arguably is more fascinating than their physical combat that is in the final scenes. It will always be a tragedy that Ledger died shortly after this movie was shot, only leaving audiences to imagine what could have been if he was available for more films. The Dark Knight is truly the best film ever made, and will stand as a pillar of greatness forever in cinema",

He does psychotic things and has no clear backstory, but you still believe why he is doing the horrible things.

Christian Bale's Batman is great, because it isn't just a superhero, it is a symbol. This makes Bruce Wayne's character also much more hearth and makes his motivations more believable. The over the top Batman voice did not even throw me off guard, because I was so invested in the character. \nThe side characters are also great. Aron Eckhart as Harvey Dent and Michael Caine are the stand-outs for me. They gave me the versions of their character I always wanted to see on the big screen.\nMaggie Gyllenhall is also a great replacement for Katie Holmes, she gives a lot (and I mean a lot) more dept to her lines than Katie did in the first movie.

            "content": "I grew up on the animated series, loved the first two Batman films, sort of liked Batman Forever but disappointed in Batman and Robin. I have yet to re-watch Batman Begins, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film on re-watch having really liked it first time. It is very well made and gripping with some great performances, but personally I would put Casablanca, Wizard of Oz, Amadeus and It's a Wonderful Life over this.\n\nThe film does suffer from being a little too talky, and the plot on occasions can be hard to follow due to a lot going on. Nevertheless it is extremely good, and not only one of the better Batman movies but also one of the better superhero movies. Visually and technically, the film cannot be faulted. The cinematography is superb and the spectacle of Gotham City is dazzling. Christopher Nolan's direction is taut, and ensures that the action is explosive.\n\nThe plot is a little bloated, with the Joker bent on destroying organised crime for good and making Batman cross between hero and vigilante, and subplots about Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes, and Hong Kong. But there are some truly effective scenes that are tightly structured, and the screenplay in general while a little too talky in the first twenty minutes is intelligent and sophisticated. The Joker especially has some very sinister lines that stay with you for a long while afterwards.\n\nThe music by none other than maestro Hans Zimmer, who also composed music for The Lion King, Gladiator and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, is outstanding. Rousing, beautiful, haunting, it is definitely memorable and doesn't become forgettable or generic like the music in The Hurt Locker for example. And I have to say the sound engineering here is phenomenal, particularly on very high volume the explosions sound very authentic as if they are coming from outside rather than from in the film.\n\nAnd I have to mention the acting, as that was terrific. Christian Bale manages to be dark, brooding and charismatic like Batman should be. Though if I did have a complaint, he does speak in a very hoarse voice as if he's got a sore throat and I somehow did not know what to make of it. It wasn't irritating or anything, just...odd. Anyway, Aaron Eckhart is terrific as Harvey Dent/Two-Face even if his storyline was a tad too rushed, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is very sensitive and caring as Rachel. Morgan Freeman does well in a smaller role, as does the excellent Gary Oldman, and Michael Caine is perfect as the loyal butler Alfred.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Heath Ledger gave the best performance of the film. He wasn't just brilliant, he was phenomenal, unpredictable, insane, extremely sinister and corrupt not to mention chillingly psychotic. I am torn on who I prefer over Jack Nicolson or Heath Ledger; it is a very close call. I admit I am more familiar with Nicolson's portrayal and liked his mix of the scary and comical and even tragic Joker, but the Joker here in The Dark Knight is truly sinister and even more of a threat to Batman and in my opinion this Joker has lines that linger longer into the memory.\n\nOverall, not absolutely perfect but it is extremely good thanks to primarily Ledger's performance and the dazzling visual spectacle. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",

My favorite part of this movie would either be every single scene of the Joker at the police station or the ferry scene. The suspense about which ship would press the button was overwhelming, I was sure that the prisoner would detonate the bomb and then I was sure yet again the civilian would trigger the explosion. The ending made you want more and was a dark and satisfying climax to such a great film. The themes were good and befitting a film of this stature, though  not iconic they successfully accompanied the film though it's admittedly somewhat overlong narrative. THE DARK KNIGHT is a dark and superior comic book adaptation that's is better than any superhero before or since. I'd give the THE DARK KNIGHT a 9.8/10.",

            "content": "The Dark Knight is a film about a vigilante named Batman who seeks justice for those who can't get it for themselves, basically a big super dude who defends the defenseless. In this movie Batman comes head to head with a formidable foe dubbed The Clown Prince of Crime, The Joker, just in case it wasn't obvious enough. The Joker plays psychological games with Batman such as, capturing those he cares for, and weakening him at his core by turning those he trusts against him, such as Two Face. Two face is a man named Harvey Dent who once fought for justice alongside Batman, but was soon corrupted by the Joker, who blows the right side of Two Face entire skin to nothing, so basically he looks really fucking creepy. This turns Two Face into a man blinded by his misfortunes. This movie is my second favorite DC film adaption, coming close to Man of Steel. It doesn't try to hide the emotion behind a bunch of hardcore action sequences, it actually manages to balance both fairly well. It doesn't do a BvS either and just have 2 hours of talking and a thirty minutes of action. It lowers Batman down from comic strength and makes him what a human at his peak would actually be. Whereas Batman from everything else manages to crack a human spine with one hand and lift a fucking crate with the other. My problems with this movie is that it is very dark, not as in emotion, you can't actually see what the fuck is going on half the time. It's hard when you trying to watch it in daytime, actually, the first time I watched this movie I then had to re-watch it days later cos I had no idea what actually happened. Then there is also Christian Bales voice. Oh my god, how many throat lozanges do you think Bale went through, He must've done some amount of damage doing that voice fore three damn movies, and it's so annoying as well. All an all this movie is another masterpiece from such an amazing director who I hope continues to make movies just as good as this. And considering how he went with Interstellar and how good Dunkirk he's upcoming film is looking, Christopher Nolans future as a director is looking up as always. I still can't get over that damn voice though.",

            "content": "The Dark Knight\n5/5 Stars\n\nThe Dark Knight wastes absolutely no time getting to the action, with the first scene as intense as the rest of the movie.  The scene depicts men wearing clown masks zip lining between high-rise buildings as their partners storm into a bank. \"Criminals in this town used to believe in things,\" a dying banker uttered as the joker shoved a hand grenade into his mouth.  \nThe film is sinister and extremely intelligent and the acting done by Heath Ledger as the Joker is outstanding.  He portrays an unbelievably evil and deadly character, whose sole mission in life is to wreak havoc in the city of Gotham.  His crimes are so elaborate and well thought out, they could only be pulled off by an evil mastermind.  Many of the lines said by the Joker in this film will go down in history as some of the wittiest and intelligently evil quotes we have seen on the big screen.  This was one of Ledgers final roles before his untimely passing, and it will always be remembered as one of his greatest accomplishments.  The horror Ledger depicts on screen does nothing but add to the sinister vibe of the film. \nOn the other hand, Christian Bale does a stand up job playing Gotham's hero, The Batman.  His character represents hope and justice for the citizens of Gotham. Unlike other \"superheroes\", The Batman has no super powers.  He's just a normal person who decided to take a stand against evil. Both the roles of good and evil are so brilliantly represented in this film in comparison to the countless other superhero movies that exist. That's what truly sets the Dark Knight apart from the rest and lands it on the top of my list when it comes to films in this category.\n            The plot line in the Dark Knight is elegantly crafted.  It's extremely easy to follow, yet it remains action packed and exciting throughout its entirety. On top of that, the scenes are well thought out and brilliant, something you don't see often in movies of this category.  At the core of this film is a battle between good and evil, but there's so much more to it than just that.  The Batman represents justice and peace to the citizens of Gotham, yet just like the Joker, he is acting against the law. The Joker believes in nothing.  He is different from all the other thieves and murders in Gotham. He thrives on conflict and evil and cares nothing about financial gain. He lives to create terror and to influence and question the morals of a \"model citizen\". In one scene, the joker rigs two boats with explosives.  One boat contained innocent people, and the other contained convicted criminals.  He gave each boat a remote detonator and gave both groups an opportunity to detonate the explosives in the other boat and save their own lives. This scene is an excellent representation of the Jokers character.  Throughout the film, he does everything in his power to influence good citizens into doing evil.\n            This excellent film by Christopher Nolan will always be remembered as a classic. It's fast paced and action packed plot keep the viewer engaged throughout the entire duration of the movie.  The acting is top notch and the scenes are extremely well thought out.  With this film breaking the single day box office record at $67 million and grossing over $158 million its first weekend on the big screen, it's blatantly obvious The Dark Knight is one of the greatest movies of the 21st century.",

Both hide behind \"masks\" they have created, both are deeply conflicted and wounded individuals at their cores, as academic author Mithun Shetty puts it \"Both are fighting against problems they believe to exist in their city, and have spawned from some tragedy in their life; they really only differ in methodology.\"(Shetty). Joker arrives in the movie not killing innocents on the streets, or tearing apart buildings in a fit of rage; he arrives almost subtly pulling off a clown mask and making off with millions in mob boss money. Joker may very well feel that what he is doing is as justified as what Bruce Wayne does, he's making an example out of those he feels are in the wrong. He brings his own brand of \"justice\" terrible and psychotic yes, but arguably equally as effective as anything Batman had perviously done in Batman Begins. Often villains are characterized as being power hungry, greedy, money-loving, self absorbed people. But the Joker is able to flip this role, without losing creepy and disturbed way he makes us the audience feel. He is ambitious, intelligent, and frankly doesn't care at all if he ends up sitting on any kind of throne. He wants to show Gotham how truly corrupt it has become, a moral rotting that has taken form all the way from the alley ways to the courts.  The movie exemplifies everything a good fight between \"good\" and evil should entail. I love this movie until the end of time.",

            "content": "WHAT I LIKED: Few films leave as much to admire as 'The Dark Knight' does, but the sheer fact that Nolan's second Batman venture is such a heady ideas-movie that's driven by such impressive spectacle means that you'll be looking up at whichever screen you're watching it on with the utmost admiration throughout. Yes for a start this film genuinely features some of the most well-choreographed action set pieces and some of the most technically impressive elements of any blockbuster ever put to film as it often immerses you with incredible visual splendour and beautifully raw sound design to accompany the energy and brilliance of the incredible cast. But whilst that's clearly a huge achievement, the main point of admiration for this film really lies with its thematic foundations, for this is a film that doesn't just discuss and interrogate its themes, but one that appears to be entirely based on them where every character and decision represents a key part in a very intricate and interesting social puzzle.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Equally however the fact it is such an ideas-based movie, and the fact these ideas are mostly rather conceptual, means that character and emotional development largely get left behind. Now it doesn't have to work like that - look no further than Nolan's other filmography to see ideas and engagement thriving together - but the problem here is that our characters are really just physical representations of conceptual ideas within a narrative that they largely govern themselves. As a result, whilst you definitely watch in awe, you equally do so with very little engagement in what's unfolding outside of each swooping set-piece.\nVERDICT: So yes, I'm one of those annoying fools who thinks 'The Dark Knight' is a touch overrated. It's an admirable film without a doubt, but it's also a flawed one in many ways.",

            "content": "According to IMDb The Dark Knight is literally a better movie than every movie ever made, except The Godfather Part I & II, and The Shawshank Redemption....\nWHAT?!\nBetter than: Citizen Kane, Gone with the Wind, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Apocalypse Now, The Wizard of Oz, Seven Samurai, Cinema Paradiso, M, etc, etc.\nAccording to IMDb it is the FOURTH greatest film of all time. I think anyone with any understanding of film can see this is completely crazy. I don't hate this movie, i quite enjoy it a fair amount, but it is very far from being any kind of ''masterpiece'' - It isn't even Nolan's best movie...\n\nWhen destructing this movie i like to use David Fincher terminology: Fincher theory is that there are films, and there are movies. A film is using cinema as art and not as JUST entertainment, such as: 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and modern movies like There Will be Blood, The Fall and Hero. (just to name a few) Then there are movies like: The Raid, Speed, The Game, and The Dark Knight, which are solely 'entertaining' films and nothing really more. Nothing to get inspired about, nothing to make you think, or ponder what has just happened. Nothing, which is fine, you wouldn't want movies like that constantly, but a movie that is solely entertainment can not be classed as one of the best movies of all time, let alone the FOURTH best.\n\nSo, why then is The Dark Knight so ridiculously popular? Nolan separates his movies from the average blockbuster by giving them a sense of realism and reliability. The most obvious example of this is his very slim use of CGI and the use of practical effects. At a time when CGI is common use, in most blockbusters, as it's much cheaper and easier, this is obviously appreciated by audiences. You can see how audiences can be awed by this.\n\nProbably the thing that most separates this movie is how he chooses to make the viewer feel empowered. Where most Batman and other superhero villains have been cliche, cheesy or unrealistic, The Dark Knight (and the other Nolan Batman movies) have had villains that feel a lot more like modern day terrorist than the average comic book villain, which is usually just ridiculous if you think about it. Post 9/11 you can imagine the impact this can have on people and the realism it gives. Though in Nolan's determination to make the viewer feel empowered he sacrifices making The Dark Knight anything more than a movie, he makes everything extremely obvious and doesnt leave anything for the viewer to work out for themselves.\n\nAt times it can even be patronizing. During the part of the movie where people are being killed until batman takes off his mask, he is constantly being by everyone even one of the officers does so. I think this is a testament to how much Nolan trusts is audience and how painstakingly obvious he thinks he has to make everything to get his point across.\n\nEven within expectations of it being a Nolan superhero film, The Dark Knight still has quite alot of faults. The main one being how anticlimactic the ending of the movie was, I was hoping/expecting some kind of big send off for the Joker but instead his send off was very brief and unsatisfying. There's also the many plot holes but i dont have anything new to say on that.\n\nA movie to be called ''One of the greatest film of all time'' it needs to excell in every aspect of filmmaking. The Dark Knight only excells at one, the performances, Heath Ledger's The Joker is excellent, he is truly phenomenal. But other than that, the direction is OK, the writing is very weak, and the movie is tedious, and overlong. The Dark Knight is good but grotesquely overrated\n\nIn short, Nolan offers a somewhat charming comic movie, that has all his usual traits: good and bad, but despite its charm, at its core is a rather one dimensional hollywood blockbuster with the popcorn audience as its target demographic. It may be the ''greatest superhero movie of all time'' but that doesnt mean a lot, does it?",

The villain played by a Stellar Heath ledger has own story arc, but at the same is mysterious as you only know of the events that are happening to him during the film but that IS his character arc. He creates mystery and character through the Unknown. Harvey dents character definitely has the most progression as it tells his story, as he put it in the beginning. \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" That is why this film will always be one of the greats.",

We use to have Batman catching the bad guys but now we have him catching drug dealers and anything that is bad in sight, and i think that's what makes The Dark Knight one of the best Batman's in the franchise.",

In this situation, though, I didn't log critiques or interesting quotes as I would while watching a movie by myself.  Here are highlights that I retained by memory:\n\n* No Robin.  Hmmm.\n\n* \"Tumbler\" Batmobile and Batpod motorcycle initially stun the audience with their speed (a simple film production trick), yet they lack creative ingenuity compared to the plethora of devices found in the Batmobile from the 1960's television series.\n\n* Heath Ledger's performance as Joker doesn't match its hype accumulated over the years.  Excellent--yes.  Contributed to his death???--one example of why I avoid franchises where the public responds like a herd of crazed sheep.\n\nNot sure whether Joker's hunched-over gait works.  Rather than adding to his persona as a \"maniacal criminal mastermind\", whenever I saw the drooping shoulders, I felt a tinge of condescending pity for him. Would have preferred to feel 100% abject fear.\n\n=====\n\nThe movie begins to drag after Joker's visit to District Attorney Harvey Dent in the hospital.  The kidnapping of Commissioner Gordon's family and all surrounding events should have hit the editing room floor.",

Just chaos for the love of chaos. I watched the first Tim Burton's Batman at cinema, when i was a child, and i loved Nicholson's Joker. But Heath Ledger's one is the true essence of the Joker, the one showed by Alan Moore's Killing Joke, for example :  not just a comic villain, not just a mad man, something completely different, something way way more disturbing and specular to Batman.The only flaw i could find in the movie is that it showed what immense talent was wasted by Heath Ledger's death. Ok, it's \"just\" a comic movie. But watch repeating in your head that Heath Ledger was  28 at the time of the movie (it looks way older because of the make up) and had decades of acting career in front of him.

I also enjoyed the character of Two-Face in the movie, but unfortunately as interesting a character as he was, he was still overshadowed by the duo of Joker versus Batman. I found myself not that invested in his character and his character motivations, since I felt that he was more of a distraction, a pawn in the two main characters' war. Supporting cast can't be left unmentioned either, as they made Gotham city around the main characters feel like a real world that exists somewhere.

The filmmaking, story and cinematography are one thing.  Then their is Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker. Through the years the Joker has been portrayed mostly as a goofy fun loving criminal more like a clown.  Not in The Dark Knight.  Ledger takes this complex character into an entirely different stratosphere in this movie.  This portrayal of the Joker is a dark sociopath with a haunted past and soul.  Making him one of the most unpredictable characters in movie history. You literally cannot take your eyes off the screen when he is performing as this character, it's just simply incredible.  Ledger deservingly won an Oscar for his role.  Just imagine years ago if you said that the guy who played The Joker in a Batman movie was going to win the Oscar.

            "content": "\"THE DARK KNIGHT\" (2008) AND THE OPPORTUNITIES OF SEQUELS\n\n\"The Godfather: Part II\" (1974). \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\" (1980). \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" (1991). And now, \"The Dark Knight\" (2008). Few franchises tell stories that transcend the first film's ambitions, and fewer still make a dent in cinematic history. Sure, you might have enjoyed \"Thor: The Dark World\" (2013) more than the original, and it could be argued that \"Lethal Weapon 2\" (1989) made an impact as notable as its predecessor, but let's focus attention on those sequels that were truly extraordinary. One word defines them, sets them apart, and describes both the method and the result.\n\nMeticulous.\n\nThese entries are steeped in detail, their characters and their themes diving far, far below the surface. They are not movies that you fully appreciate until the second or fifth or twentieth viewing, a process that speaks to their depth rather than an inability to tell a clear story. Before that, however, it's important to acknowledge that, in truth, they are testaments to the potential of their originals. Each franchise poses a fascinating concept in its first film, fraught with storytelling opportunity:\n\n- A returned war hero is eager to build and nourish a life of his own, autonomous to his mobster father and family - a family he loves so much that he is drawn further and further in as their eventual savior and leader. He resolves the crisis that forced his hand and sells his soul in the process.\n\n- A farm boy longing for a life bigger than his remote world is pulled into a high-stakes adventure that sends him careening through a war-torn galaxy. Boasting faded innocence and invigoration born of clarified purpose, he is baptized as a samurai of the stars and takes the first steps on a narrower strip of destiny.\n\n- A good-natured waitress targeted in a serial killing is kidnapped from her normal life by a warrior sent from a holocaustic future; she learns that her unborn son becomes this future's last hope. Humanity's apocalyptic enemy, an evolved artificial intelligence, tasks an infiltrating machine assassin with a kamikaze mission to kill the mother before the son is even conceived.\n\n- An orphaned prince dedicated to justice in its rawest form wanders the earth with the sole purpose of becoming the most dangerous possible version of himself. He returns to his ravaged kingdom, the kingdom that slaughtered his parents, and unleashes a dark assault of purified rage upon its underworld.\n\nThese tales are ideas you just can't walk away from. They invite, nay, beg a continuation of the story. Yet their creators weren't content with maintaining status quo for their next installments - they wanted to expand their mythology, pick apart psyches, and introduce ideas that we didn't even realize were prevalent in the original concepts all along. They sought to overwhelm their audiences with a rich tapestry of human experiences, immense conflicts, and enhanced worlds. They succeeded.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" is the most recent addition to what I un-creatively refer to as the Sequel Hall Of Fame?. Strongly influenced by Michael Mann's crime epic \"Heat\" (1995) in both tone and scope, \"The Dark Knight\" is the further realization of Christopher Nolan's ambitious effort to bring Batman and the trials of Gotham City into the real world. His intelligent, careful portrayal of these fictitious elements is what allows this sequel - featuring a guy in a bat costume going up against a guy in a clown costume - to transcend the comic book movie genre and become a crime saga in its own right.\n\nThe titular hero and the Joker battle not just each other, but for the soul of Gotham itself. Batman is lured deeper and deeper into the cunning and frightening psyche of his enemy, forced to confront the uncomfortable truth of his relationship with a city still teetering on the brink of utter corruption. The now classic interrogation scene that centers the film is just as fascinating after the umpteenth viewing, reinforcing the idea that these characters are two sides of the same coin.\n\nBatman thrives in darkness night after night, remorselessly throwing himself into Gotham's filthy maw, risking being swallowed by it entirely. The Joker pushes the hero to the point where Batman fears he must become his foe to truly stop him. Even after his final capture, the Joker still claims a victory: the loss of Harvey Dent. The symbol that stood tall in the daylight and boldly confronted criminals, the only chance to replace the shadowy, \"silent guardian\" symbol of Batman, threatens to be extinguished. But although Gotham's white knight is consumed by the rage and obsession of Two-Face until his untimely end, Commissioner Gordon and the Dark Knight secure the city's future, allowing its true hero to shoulder the blame in the aftermath of the Joker's reign of terror.\n\nAbsorbing the intensity of both the action and psychology of \"The Dark Knight\" takes time. It invites repeat viewings, and joins the aforementioned sequels in demanding a higher class of storytelling. Nolan has stated that he had no plans for a continuation of \"Batman Begins\" unless the right plot required it; \"The Dark Knight\" was not written purely for money, but for the rarified joy of seeing compelling narrative supported by intriguing characters. And while the late Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning Joker performance will stand alone in movie history, don't move on too quickly from Hans Zimmer's atonal score, dragging us into the chaos of this madman. Wally Pfister's cinematography is on fine display as well - Gotham feels real and inhabited, allowing the audience to fully connect with the \"reality\" of its creator's universe.\n\nA quality sequel reinforces this universe, and plumbs its depths anew. It allows the story to become reality, to answer questions that were never even posed in its predecessor. The war heroes, farm boys, waitresses, and princes will learn more about themselves and help us understand the opportunities and pitfalls of not only humanity, but the stories we tell.",

The movie was released in 2008, and was by far one of the greatest Batman movies of all time, with over a billion dollars in revenue at the box office. The movie continues the tale of Bruce Wayne, and his role as guardian of Gotham City. With the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, appointed to Gotham, the city's biggest mobsters are afraid that their organizations will come to an end. Batman is caught in the middle of it when a psychotic criminal, the joker, is hired to put an end to Batman, and all the he stands for. Batman must stop the joker, who is played by Heath Ledger, from turning Gotham city into a nightmare of violence and destruction. Overall the Dark Knight was an outstanding movie for many reasons. The movie portrayed an excellent example of good and evil, and the roles each character plays. Also, their are many excellent examples of symbolism throughout the movie, and finally, the Dark Knight uses excellent music in certain scenes to add to the overall effect of the movie.",

            "content": "The film, The Dark Knight, is set in a chaotic city full of corruption and anarchy that is in desperate need of a savior.  The city of Gotham is overrun with mobs and dirty cops that never allows the system of the police force to take action.  This is where Batman comes in.  Alongside the new Commissioner, Gordon, he and Batman work together to take down criminals.  Although Batman can be unconventional at times he always gets the job done and never harms anyone more than he has to.  He makes the city a safer place even if the townspeople don't agree or even knows, the town of Gotham would be running under the control of the criminals without this vigilante.  \n\tThe movie portrays the evil that subsides in Gotham through the cinematography.  The producer uses costumes, setting, and colors to their advantage to create the overall feeling of the movie.   Throughout the entire film it feels dark and gloomy because the city is surrounded by corruption which they cannot escape.  Within the city, there is a new villain in town who is bored of the typical criminal scene and wants to try something new: seek out Batman.  In the opening scene of The Dark Knight, we are introduced to the Joker as a man who is a mastermind at his work.  He has an elaborate plan to break into a bank, however, he is killing off every team member one by one after they are not needed anymore.  This shows how dangerous he is and how he does not follow the rules even the rules of criminals.  He is always seen wearing a purple suit and clown makeup covering up his scars.  This is contradictory to Bruce Wayne's Batman outfit that is all black with sleek lines that is incredibly intimidating.  The contrasting costumes also take part in representing the theme of chaos verse order.  This is because the Joker's messy, purple outfit is never put together whereas Batman always appears to has things in order and firece. Although the two are polar opposites, both are frightening costumes for different reasons. \n\tThe movie focuses on the crime and corruption that takes place not only on the streets of Gotham but in the police stations and politics as well.  The Dark Knight also has multiple side stories allowing it to fall into multiple genres so it can be classified as a crime, action and adventure, superhero, and a romance film all in one.  Throughout the film Batman has to intervene and capture criminals that have been able to escape and avoid the police time after time.  An example of this is when Batman is asked by Harvey and Gordon to fly to Hong Kong to capture Lau, a supposedly good business man who actually ends up working for the mob in Gotham, because it is out of their jurisdiction.  The Dark Knight can be easily classified as a crime action and adventure movie because of the speed chases, fight scenes, and battles that take place from the very opening scene to the last.  We are first introduced to Batman busting a drug deal between a known mobster, Chechen, and the Scarecrow.  Batman comes crashing in with his Batmobile and makes his deserving, grand entrance.  He quickly takes out each criminal one by one, without killing a single criminal, using only his combat skills and strength.  He ties Chechen, Scarecrow, and their henchmen to wait for the police arrive to take care of the necessary and correct punishment.  The movie intertwines each storyline, from action to romance, to create a larger and stronger plot.  \nIn the movie, the Joker revealed he had a plan for Harvey Dent: to see him fall.  Harvey Dent was known as the White Knight of Gotham for cleaning up the streets, through the courts.  This even made Bruce Wayne question himself about continuing being Batman or not.  The Joker saw Harvey Dent as a challenge as to whether or not he could make the purest man, filled with greatness, fall down to the depths of evil.  This can be foreshadowed with the coin Harvey Dent had that was two-sided.  He used it for good things as in to decide whether or not he would take his girlfriend, Rachel, out for dinner that night or who would take lead on the case that day.  Once the Joker set his plan into motion to destroy the goodness that was in Harvey Dent, the only person that could truly stop it was Batman.  However, the problem was that the Joker made it so Batman had to choose between Harvey and Rachel.   Rachel and Harvey were both tied up to gasoline drums triggered to explosives that were to be set off at any given moment.  The Joker gave Batman the location of where Rachel and Harvey where being held.  Without a blink of an eye, Batman jumped on to his motorcycle and drove as fast as he could to save Rachel and Gordon left with his police team to try to save Dent.  Rachel and Harvey Dent were able to talk to one another through speaker phones the Joker had set up, so they knew one of them was going to die.  They were beginning to say their goodbyes just when Batman had arrived in time to save Rachel, except it wasn't Rachel.  The Joker had lied and switched addresses knowing he would choose to save the woman.  Gordon doesn't make it to the destination in time and Rachel is killed.  The buildings are blown up and Harvey's face is half burnt off.  Although he is the one who survived, something inside him changed and he became a lost man seeking revenge.  The Joker had successfully brought down the light of Gotham the people had looked up to and turned him into a monster.  Now known as Two Face, he urged vengeance on those who took part in the scheme that killed Rachel.  His now burnt two sided coin played a part in his role as a villain.  Harvey now used the coin as a tool to decide whether or not a person would live or die.  \"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain\"-Harvey Dent\n\n\t\tThroughout the Dark Knight the movie plays with different themes between multiple pairs of characters and the society as a whole.  At the end of the movie, Batman decides to take the blame of Harvey Dent's actions in order to preserve his image of a White Horse and leader.  Gordon agrees to this plan because he knows the people of Gotham need hope, and that person was Dent.  Batman is acting as a scapegoat and the people will now fear Batman also as a criminal for what he has supposedly done.  A constant theme throughout the movie was between the Joker representing chaos and Batman representing order.  Batman rejects the idea and temptation of the dark side, he does not choose to kill anyone but only chooses to bring the criminals to justice and allow the court system punish them the correct way.  This is demonstrated when Batman is driving his motorcycle directly in the path of the Joker and the Joker is yelling \"Hit me!\" over and over again, however, last minute Batman swerves out of the way and falls off of his bike in order to miss the Joker.  This shows how he does now want to kill the Joker because that is not in his character, Batman wants to follow through carrying out punishment the correct way: through jail time.  The Joker was drawn to Batman because he saw him as a worthy opponent to play his games with.  The Joker also challenges Harvey, creating the theme of good versus evil throughout the film.  Ultimately, the Joker wins the battle between him and Harvey because he was able to break Harvey down after the death of Rachel.  However, Batman was able to win the war.  The Joker was finally able to be locked up for good by the S.W.A.T. team in the end thanks to Batman.  \n\tThe movie The Dark Knight plays a major role in configuring good versus evil on a new level.  Batman isn't a normal hero because he isn't portrayed as a good man throughout majority of the movie but rather an outcast.  The townspeople see Batman as a person who is causing more harm than good which is not the case.  Batman seeks to help his city of Gotham which he ultimately succeeds at but has to hide what he has done for the greater good.  The Joker and criminals who live in Gotham overrun the city day in and day out and has a strong grip on society, this is extremely dangerous and Batman has recognized this.  Batman is an unusual hero but ultimately he saves the city for his dedication, although he doesn't follow the norm of what a superhero should be he is still one of the greats.",

Tutte caratteristiche che sembrava impossibile comprimere in un unico grande film, ma il regista Nolan \u00e8 riuscito nell'impresa, la creazione di un capolavoro senza tempo, esattamente il film che tutti noi volevamo. Con grande coerenza vengono mantenute tutte le numerose note positive del primo film, il realismo generale in primis ed in secondo luogo una trama ancora pi\u00f9 complessa ed intricata che sfocia in temi molto pi\u00f9 intensi e coinvolgenti. Ancora perfetti e convincenti tutti gli aspetti tecnici, che confermano una grande organizzazione produttiva e una spiccata intelligenza da parte di tutto il team. Quello che eleva il film a capolavoro, per\u00f2, \u00e8 il poderoso personaggio antagonista. Il merito non va solo al grandissimo attore, che ci regala una delle migliori interpretazioni della storia, ma anche al regista e agli sceneggiatori che riescono ad introdurre il concetto del Joker in una narrazione che non aveva bisogno d'altro. E' proprio il contrasto tra Joker e gli altri personaggi del film a creare l'antagonista perfetto, che garantisce enorme forza narrativa e coinvolgimento senza fine. Il conflitto di questi grandi personaggi regala un'esperienza profonda ed intensa che non si limita alla durata del film ma dona insegnamenti morali non banali ad una grande fetta di pubblico. Un gradino sopra anche a Spider-Man 2, secondo la mia modesta opinione i migliori comic book movie della storia.",

This is one of the greatest performances ever given in the 2000's decade. His performance was amazing, giving us a great interpretation of the Joker.  The acting is also very good in this movie, from Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Aaron Eckhart. The Cinematography is very good, showing off Chicago in an awesome way. The ending is so awesome that I am glad there were commercials, and I could take a break from the amazing action. The news scene from the Joker, is one of my favorite movie moments in film history. In fact the only thing that does not work as good as the other things in the movie is Christian Bale's voice as Batman. It is not the best, but I could stand the voice. But, that is a nitpick. The Dark Knight is a great movie, and one of my favorite movies of al time. It is definitely a must see.",

This is not a comment on the actors, but a comment on a mangled screenplay that was more like a draft, a movie that couldn't decide on its genre and didn't want to be compared to it's comic book roots. \n\nThe thing about this movie was that it had some truly great lines and great scenes but an presented with an overall image of some kind of Frankenstein's monster. As if the best scenes had been pilfered from several different movies and strung together with great expectations and a hope for something wonderful only to come away with something ugly. I'm not sure if anyone else will agree with me, or even see what i'm talking about... But this wasn't batman. This was an unfortunate shade.",

His performance is easily one of my top five favorite movies villain portrayals and his Joker is so twisted and haunting that he was pretty unsettling at times. This movie has everything a great movie can have and it made Christopher Nolan one of my favorite directors. This may be my favorite superhero film and may be one of the most unforgettable and best films of all time.

This movie builds off the first installment as a continuation of the same story, and Nolan's interpretation of the great anti-hero takes an unexpected twist, providing fans with an epic finale that most movie-goers have not seen since the infamous Empire Strikes Back. The satisfying conclusion will leave you wanting more as the somber tones stay with you long after the credits roll.

            "content": "According to IMDb; the dark knight is better the apocalypse now,\ncitizen Kane, raging bull and 2001: a space odyssey and the forth\ngreatest film of all time. I think anyone with any understanding of film can see this is completely crazy. I don't hate this movie and I quite enjoyed it but it's very far from being any kind of masterpiece. \n\nWhen destructing Christopher Nolan's movie's I like to use David Fincher's terminology; Fincher theory is that there are films then there are movies. A film is using cinema as art and not just entertainment, such as; the godfather, mirror, There will be blood. A movie would be something of a guilty pleasure: the game, the raid, the dark knight. \n\nSo then why is it the dark knight is so popular? Nolan separates his movies from the average blockbuster by giving them a sense of realism and reliability. The most obvious example of this is his very limited use of CGI and use of practical effects. At a time when CGI is common use in most blockbusters as it is cheaper and easier; you can see how audiences can be awed by this. \n\nProbably the thing that most separates his movies; is how he chooses to\nmake the viewer feel empowered. Where most Batman and superhero\nvillains have been clich\u00e9 and even cheesy; In the dark knight (and the\nother dark knight movies) the villains feel a lot more like modern day\nterrorists then the average comic book villain. Post 911 you can\nimagine the impact this can have on people and the realism it gives.\nThough in Nolan's determination to make the viewer feel empowered he\nsacrifices making the dark knight anything more then a movie; he makes everything extremely obvious and doesn't leave anything for the viewer to work out for themselves. \n\nAt times it can even be patronizing. During the part of the\nmovie where people are being killed until batman takes off his mask; he\nis constantly being blamed by everyone, even one of the officers does so. I think this is a testament to how much Nolan trusts he's audience and how painstakingly obvious he thinks he has to make everything to get a point across. \n\nEven within expectations of it being a Nolan super hero movie, the dark knight still has faults. The main one being how anti climatic the ending of the movie was, I was expecting some kind of big send off for the joker but instead his send off was brief and unsatisfying. There's also the many the plot holes but I don't have anything new to say on that.     \n\nIn short Nolan offers somewhat charming comic book movie, that has all his usual traits; good and bad. And despite it's charm, at it's core it's a rather one dimensional Hollywood blockbuster; with the popcorn audience as it's target demographic. It may be the \"greatest super hero movie of all time\" but that doesn't mean a lot.",

This effectively emphasises the magnitude of his performance that he managed to capture the attention and hearts of $1 billion dollar worth of viewers and force his way to the Oscar even if he wasn\u00e2??t there to receive it. His reincarnation of the most intriguing villain is freshly fanatical. He is a highly intelligent, maniacally twisted clown who forces his way up the dread ladder and manages to control Gotham\u00e2??s actions by simply bulldozing his fear factor into people\u00e2??s skeletons. His unrecognisable empathy levels is because he is a psychopathic, mass murdering clown who like all villains wants to upset the social order and define himself by his battles with Batman. His appearance is spot on! He wears purple jacket and gloves, scruffy undergarments, white face paint, mildly fluorescent yellowy-green hair and the much-needed real life scars. He brings a terrifying realism to his method-acted role and is able to wholly distinguish himself from Jack Nicholson\u00e2??s interpretation and in fact completely blows him away. There is nothing comical about this Joker, he is just chillingly mesmerising in everything he does.\n \nWhilst the Joker is startlingly good, the brilliance of Batman in this film is that he manages to never be overshadowed by the Joker, he stays as the hero and even though we love the ultra-villainous Joker, Batman is our hero and we never want to see him fail. Then it is no wonder the scenes involving our protagonists are the best moments in a film that is jam-packed with spectacular sequences.\n \nFirstly, the genius of the fundraising scene is that it builds and climaxes with verve, never relenting, just amplifying! The wordplay is perfect, from when the Joker tells Rachel how he got his scars, to the point she kicks him and Batman saves the day, up until the Joker dangles Rachel out of the window and Batman hopelessly utters \u00e2??let her go\u00e2?? and the Joker listens to his \u00e2??poor choice of words\u00e2?? and releases her for Batman to rescue. Not only is it the moment that the Batman and the Joker first encounter each other, but it is also the scene that skilfully lets you know that the final 2 hours will be a thrill to sit through.\n \nThe second scene that amazes is the interrogation scene where even the Joker is surprised by the Batman\u00e2??s appearance. The image of both the Batman and the Joker looks as if it has just been plucked out of a comic book; it stays true to the comics whilst adding its own spice to the proceedings. The fluctuation of power between Batman and the Joker is electrifying as Batman uses his raw power to attempt to overcome his nemesis, but the Joker employs his dastardly ways yet again to deceive everyone, even the audience, and delivers a killer blow to Batman.\n \nAmidst the palaver, Aaron Eckhart\u00e2??s Harvey Dent\u00e2??s, the white knight of the Gotham, is broken and renovated into Two-Face; another of the wacko antiheroes Batman must defeat. Dent is quite irritating as the arrogant district attorney whose only shining light is that he is the only person who shows his face in the battle against Gotham\u00e2??s dirt, which essentially backfires upon him. Once he becomes Two-Face in such spectacular fashion where half of his face his burns off and he does not even need to plaster himself up, he dazzles as someone so malevolent, it was as if his character was born to be a villain! He is probably even more maniacal than his villainous counterpart, the Joker, as like the Joker he has nothing to lose anymore but is eagerly impatient to cause pain to the innocent because of the loss of his fianc\u00c3\u00a9, Rachel Dawes.\n \nUndoubtedly, Rachel is the most irksome of all the main characters. The replacement of Katie Holmes with Maggie Gyllenhaal is not confusing at all, however, although to Bruce, Rachel means everything, to the audience she is so fucking annoying\u00e2?\u00a6 she keeps playing around with Bruce\u00e2??s feelings telling him she wants to be with him then deciding to marry Dent. When her character was gotten rid of by the twistedly brilliant deceitfulness of the Joker\u00e2??s antics, there is an underlying joy that her character is now defunct because to be honest she is a frustrating character in both films, no matter who the actress is!\n \nNevertheless, from the opening heist scene, to the Joker\u00e2??s first, second, third, fourth, fifth appearance, Harvey\u00e2??s transformation into Two-Face, the realistic action sequences or the dark tone that permeates throughout, The Dark Knight is a truly magical 152 minutes that capture the hearts of anyone that lays eyes on this gem. The genius of this film is that it brings a terrifying realism to Gotham that it contravenes your typical superhero film and becomes a consuming tragedy that leaps boundaries of cinematic expectation.\n        \nThe second outing of the Caped Crusader will undeniably be heralded as the greatest ever superhero film. It transcends every boundary set by previous superhero films and continues to set the pace for new ones. A modern masterpiece.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        10/10",

He just stole the place and really surprised the audience which is refreshing to see that when almost all the time, people expect positive things about the aspects of the film, but with this, they just expect Heath Ledger to suck and never be as memorable as Jack Nicholson. Christopher Nolan and writer Jonathan Nolan knew what the Joker is like and they created one of the best and unpredictable villains in superhero movies. Christian Bale is great as Bruce Wayne, and his Batman voice is still silly, but I try to take it serious and get used to it. Michael Caine is really great as always, Gary Oldman always does his best to give off a memorable performance, and Aaron Eckhart gives off a wonderful performance that it's sad to see that people are going to remember him as Harvey Dent, and nothing else. The story is really good, and the writing is just ingenious. People would think of The Dark Knight as one of the best superhero films, and in my opinion. They are right on that one.",

People sensitive to spiritual and psychological evil should be warned that the Joker of this movie is as disturbing as Hannibal Lector; however, the Joker is the key to this movie's greatness. Without his depth of evil and incisive commentary, we do not understand what is truly at stake in the battle for Gotham. A superheroe's heroism never rises above the depth of the supervillain's villainy; This movie delivers in Spades because the Joker brings us to the depths of despair and morbid curiosity - and then Batman find a way to win! This is a movie where the hero wins, but it costs Batman something he can't get back - until next installment.",

No super powers, just rich, badass and awesome, and I think this movie takes the number one place out of both the Batman franchise, and super hero movies.  Plus we got the Joker, my number one by far villain, who is played amazingly well by Heath Leager.  As good as a movie as the Dark Knight Rises is, and how strong and evil an enemy as Bane is this movie takes number one, but it is a close call for sure.  The acting is great, by everyone, but particularly by the Joker, who looks better, and crazier, and more badass than the original one played by Jack Nicholson, although he did great as well.  The script is good, and the effects are great too, far better than the original franchises and improved over Batman Begins. The action is awesome to watch, faced pace, intense and well done with effects and all the goodies.  The hand to hand that is typical of Batman is great as usual, but it's the car chases and scene with the Tumbler fighting to protect the police cars moving the prisoner, against the Joker in his semi truck, with it's great final climax.  The Scarecrow is back again, not for long, but still loose and not to be caught, leaving possibility for more use of his character.  The ending is good, but I was disappointed with the last scene with the Joker.  Not very climactic for his character, and being such a famous and my favourite villain, was hoping for more.  Using the phone sonar to find him seemed kinda ceap, but I guess it's Batman can't go without some over the top gadgets.  I can only hope for a final movie with the Joker and Scarecrow as the last bad guys in maybe the Dark Knight Returns of something, but after the ending of The Dark Knight Rises and the death of Heath Leager I dought that will ever happen unfortunately.  Anyways great movie, best scenes are for sure anything with the Joker, he's the star of the show for me, couldn't get enough of him and was a amazing movie all together.",

The Dark Knight booms into Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, who is so crazy and menacing it stops being enjoyable, just boring and not that creepy. Christian Bale has voice problems, and unrealistic fantasy story powers that turn Batman into nothing but a muscular man in a black suit that just jumps around doing stuff. The movie is awfully long, that has so many unusual and unnecessary talks and scenes just to make a Nolan film Nolan type like boring Superheroes. I got the feeling that it repeated so much, that it wasn't pleasant at all. I know why Ledger got the Oscar, he was ok but the rest of the movie was confusing and made no sense where none of it supported anything. Did you notice any mistakes? The Joker is being choked by Batman, and his hands keep fidgeting. Also, the whole\u00c2\u00a0trailer, captions, and plot misleads everything from watching the movie. You start to decide who to follow in the last 45 minutes, because everyone is doing something that has\u00c2\u00a0some representation on them or that The Dark Knight gets longer and more intense, but stupid. The minds of everyone is so dumb, like Dumb and Dumber meeting superheroes, combined to make stuff. So bad and pathetic. Rated PG-13.",

            "content": "Everybody knows about The Dark Knight. Absolutely everyone. The morbid curosity which surrounded the film as a result of Heath Ledger's passing was global. So the hype which surrounded Christopher Nolan's second chapter of the rebooted Batman franchise was unbelieveable. Good thing it was warranted then.\u00a0\n\nFrom the opening scene, the opening shot, the opening note of Hanz Zimmer and James Newton Howard's incredible score, the very moment that the film begins, you know you're in for something good. What follows is 2 and a half hours of pure cinematic brilliance, with amazing set piece after aMAZing set piece, all the while interjected with character building side-steps and action escalating build-ups. This film will have you rooted to your seat from start to finish. You won't even notice the exhorbitant runtime.\u00a0\n\nChristopher Nolan's direction in this film is masterful. Making full use of his incredible cast and their abilities as well as keeping you on the edge of your seat in the action sequences, he uses his IMAX cameras in groundbreaking form, shooting chase sequences, hesits, fights, everything, in crystal clear IMAX quality. He gives a sense of serenity to the chaos, doing away with the handheld camera feel which action movies tend to lean towards, utilising, instead, some incredible cinematography and inventiveness to capture beautifully long-held shots in places where you wouldn't expect to see beautifully long-held shots. He shows that as long as what you're watching on screen is as ridiculously awesome as it is in this film, you don't need to shake the camera from side to side constantly. This makes for much easier viewing. Instead of having to fight to see what's on the screen, you're basking in the awesomeness of the choreographed genius being played out on screen.\u00a0\n\nThe script is fantastic, a perfect balance between the over-stylised feel of a comic book and often-too-cryptic realism, creating a script which is both entertaining and definitely not superficial. The comedic moments are underplayed enough to not feel forced, as are the emotional moments, and unnecessary dialogue is trimmed to great avail. The script could have been twice as long and incredibly bulky, as comic book films often are. Instead, this script is endlessly quotable and a perfect place for the actors to find their characters.\u00a0\n\nSpeaking of characters, The Dark Knight dances its way through the usual troubles of a sequel without a step wrong, even including extra little flourishes for good measure. Batman keeps his character of incorruptibility, but instead of finding it in the first place like in its predecessor, this time its put to the test; stretching and straining him to breaking point and seeing the results. And the stretcher and strainer is none other than one of the greatest characters created in the last 20 years: The Joker. A ramping-up and supercharging of Tim Burton's Joker in '89, The Joker is, in his own words, \"an unstoppable force.\" The moment he appears on the screen, you can see the crazy in his eyes, with an even deeper level lurking at the back. A true psychopath, he is vicious, cold, brutal, chilling and utterly likeable. No matter how bad he gets, no matter how many chills run up your spine, there is not a moment in the film when you truly don't like him. Maybe it's the hint of laughter in all of his craziness or the dark humour in everything he does, but it makes it difficult to root for Batman when there's such a fascinating opponent onscreen. As with all great films, the two characters are a perfect juxtaposition of each other; each with the same level of ambition, each with a mind to change the world, each with the same ability to influence people to their respective causes, but each one having chosen or being forced down a completely opposite path to one another. And this aspect is the most difficult for Batman to conquer; to, in essence, face himself. His bizarro-self maybe, but himself nonetheless. When these two titans clash onscreen, that's where stars are born.\u00a0\n\nThe acting is of a completely different, higher, standard than its predecessor, good as it was in the original. The inclusion of Ledger is a perfect casting choice, and the posthumous Oscar is proof of that, but it truly is a tour de force performance. He inhabits The Joker entirely, from his scarily dark undertones in his voice, muscular ticks, everything. It's an incredible character to be trusted with bringing to life and Ledger lives up to the task and even goes beyond. The rest of the cast are fantastic as well. Though nobody in the film measures up to Ledger's monumental role, they all pull their weight, Bale especially. He shows more sides to the often one-dimensional character and shows a depth which is lacking among a lot of the current Hollywood \"talent.\" His previous amazing performances (see American Psycho) are enough to make any casting agent's jaw drop, but this one is especially notable. His softer moments are ironically the most hard-hitting. Not that he is any less convincing in action, but the raw talent and incredible skill shown in his moments of doubt should show the rest of the world how to really play a superhero. The rest of the cast, though they are not the main focus, really are great, with Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Maggie Gyllenhall, Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart creating a thick web of talent.\u00a0\n\nBut this is the film worthy of this incredible cast list. A film which stays true to its superhero roots while, at the same time, redefining the entire genre. From the beautiful blue filter of nighttime, remeniscent of Michael Mann's 'Heat,' to the amazing work with the fantastic IMAX cameras, to set-piece after set-piece after set-piece, each more amazing than the last, and not least of all Ledger's incredible performance of an amazing character, The Dark Knight will spin you about and knock you for six every time you watch it. Heath, we hardly knew you. Rest in peace.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nBatman and The Joker in a not quite conventional interrogation scene.",

            "content": "\tThis review is extremely personal as has spoilers\n\n   Though it's been over 6 years, 'Dark Knight' is still a masterpiece. Even compared to movies these days, Dark Knight is just outstanding. However, such flattery has been said over and over by critics and viewers. They say how they enjoyed the amazing action scenes, how Batman was amazing, and most of all, how joker was just jaw dropping. \n   Of course, everything about this is true, however, I'd like to focus on a rather veiled character, the man known as Harvey Dent. I think Harvey Dent is amazing and could have even been a main villain in a different movie. Its just a shame how he was lost all the spotlight by the Joker. I believe that the main character of the 'Dark Knight' is neither Batman nor the Joker, but Harvey Dent. He is Gotham's white knight who is eventually corrupted and becomes 'Two face'. That is why I believe that 'Hero' and 'Villain' are just on different sides on the same coin.\n   Harvey Dent is Gotham's new hero. He put 550 criminals in jail (Half of the criminals in Gotham)! Though he had the help of batman, he is still praised as a hero in Gotham. That is when we can see the difference between Batman and Harvey. One is exposed and one is not. One shows his identity while the other hides it. One is the 'Dark Knight' and one is the 'White Knight'. With such an attractive hero in the city, the citizens want Batman to disappear. Though Batman helps the citizens of Gotham, he is still considered a hooligan since he goes around and destroys the city. The citizens desire a hero that is safe, not a hero that is dangerous. However, unlike the citizens, Harvey Dent protects and advocates Batman by saying that he is batman. Someone who understands and needs batman appeared.\n   Unfortunately a problem occurs; the Joker kidnaps Harvey Dent and his girlfriend Rachel. Batman has to choose to only save one of them. Though Batman tries to go and save Rachel, he was tricked by the Joker eventually saves Harvey Dent. In this incident Harvey Dent burns have of his face due to burning oil. After the incident, Harvey Dent learns the fact that he lost Rachel and becomes the villain 'Two face'. Harvey Dent did not become 'Two face' because he lost his face, but because he lost other half, Rachel. This is depicted in the movie as the coin Harvey always had. One is fine, but the other side is burnt.\n   Harvey Dent, or rather 'Two face' then begins to aim his hate towards the very justice he tried to protect. Joker did help Harvey become 'Two face', but he was only a trigger. The Joker and the police betrayed Harvey. Though the police had there own reasons (family was threatened), Harvey was still betrayed by what he was trying to protect. Thus, he was reborn as 'Two face'. Corrupted justice created a new villain. However, that new villain was no other than 'Two face', once Gotham's White Knight. Later on, we can see Harvey punishing the corrupt police with his game of 'chance'. He flips the coin and kills the person depending on whether it was head or tails. \n  Though 'Two face' is later killed late in movie, he left too much of an impression. So called 'Justice' created a corrupted hero. A White Knight was betrayed by what he believed the most. All I see is irony in this movie.",

            "content": "So far in Nolan's career, he has managed to turn around excellent films, however 3 of them are perfect examples of cinema at its finest. The Dark Knight, is not only one of them but it could quite well possibly be, one of the greatest blockbusters ever made. In Batman Begins, Nolan managed to create a grounded universe for our caped crusader to stand up for. Now the building blocks were down, this was our chance to see what the new Batman franchise could really accomplish and my oh my is it nothing short of genius. Now resided to a penthouse and an underground bunker, Bruce Wayne continues his vigilante duties, followed by Batman fanatics. Since the last outing, Batman has become a celebrity, people want to be him. Gotham has a new DA, Harvey Dent, who's sole objective is to clean up the streets of Gotham for good and bring as many criminals to justice as physically possible, even if it means endangering himself. Life couldn't get much peachier, that is until The Joker, turns up and turns not only Gotham upside down, but our hero's morals. The Joker spends his time trying to push everything to the limit, fixated by the bat, he is the true idea of anarchy. This forces Batman to go to dangerous lengths to stop this mad man, who has some striking similarities to himself. The regulars are back and continue to build upon and strengthen their characters, new to the ball park however is Aaron Eckheart and Heath Ledger and what an addition this pair make. Ledger's Joker, makes every itteration of the characters previous portrayal look like ametuer hour. He turns the Joker into something frightening, something uncontrolable and mysterious, everytime you think he's letting you in on a little back story, he flips it on its head 5 minutes later. Heath, totally stepped well out of the norm to get this role up and running and it shows, he steals the entire show here. His scene's with Bale are tremendous, their constant moral conflict it exciting and engaging and you genuinely have your heart in your mouth anytime the Joker shows up to play. Eckheart gives our good pal, Harvey Two Face a much needed piece of profesionalism. Unlike Tommy Lee Jones who played him as a laughing maniac, Dent here is more passionate, proper, his motives are true and meaningful. He truely wants to make a difference, he wants to join Batman and Gordon and catch the Joker, he is Gotham's white knight. Only the Joker knows spoils him for good. His transformation is just handled expertly. Eckheart gives a believability to the character that could have came across as completely hoaky if played by a lesser actor, here were in safe hands. The usual suspects crew wise show up to have their input as well Pfister and Zimmer make this film look and sound eerily frightening and realistic, gone is the old Gotham, here is the new shine, with some fantastic visuals and a grade to die for. The film never feels bloated, it never stops, it never gives you a moment. Even in its closing moments we are left hearts pounding. This is a bleak film, its handled amazingly by Nolan, who miraculously manages to keep it relatively family friendly but make no mistakes about it, just because it isnt gory does not mean its not adult. This is a modern day, gripping, disturbing and awe inspiring look and phsychology, terrorism and technology. It's doused in social commentary and not only leaves Batman asking himself questions but us as viewers. When a film can sit and make everyone shut up for over 2 hours and constantly haunt you, when it stays fresh over constant watching, when it inspires an entire genre of movies to come, that is when you know you have something special in your hands. Not for the feint hearted but one hell of a horrifying ride. Must own.",

            "content": "It's 1981. I walk in to QuikTrip, a convenience store in the Midwest, in this case Broken Arrow, OK. I fumble through my allowance, trying to find out if I want a 3 Musketeers bar, a Twix bar or a made-by-me sundae from the soft serve ice cream bar. I'm bored with all that stuff, I tell myself. And I drift over to the comic book rack. I've never read one, except maybe for an occasional Richie Rich, Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry one. I find a rather odd book from DC Comics called Captain Carrot and his Amazing Zoo Crew. #1. It's a collector's item! Aren't they all?\n\nI buy it. I read it. A gazillion times. I love it. But it doesn't translate into other additional comic book purchases, at least for another year or so. No, I was too busy pumping my allowance into Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nFast forward to 1982...maybe 1983. I walk into a Walgreens in Sunrise, FL. (I got around quite a bit as a kid). I buy a DC Comics issue of Brave and the Bold. It's a \"team-up\" comic, which featured, in this case, Batman and Ragman. Yes...Ragman. I read it. A gazillion times. Again...no translation into additional comic book purchases though.\n\nFast forward even more to later in 1983. I walk into a 7-Eleven in Thousand Oaks, CA (see what I mean...I got around...cross country this time) with my allowance. Still struggling to define the merits of one calorie-laden candy bar over another. And out of the corner of my eye, I locate the Avengers. I buy it. I read it. A gazillion times. This time, I'm hooked. Yeah, maybe I'm a little slow, but I finally realize that I like these little things.\n\nObsessively, comic books consume my life from 6th grade until early high school, when girls took over my interests. During that span of time, Daredevil met Elektra. Superman was rebooted John Byrne style. Mike Zeck introduced the black Spider-Man costume that would eventually become Venom. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles came out of their shell. Alan Moore made sure adults would read comics too with Watchmen. And Frank Miller redefined Batman, and comic book writing, with the The Dark Knight Returns.\n\nI was done with comics when all of the above ensured that prices outlasted the paltry allowance of an early teen. I just couldn't afford to continue. It didn't stop me from being interested when Batman, from Tim Burton, Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, came out. It looked dark. Not Frank Miller/Dark Knight Returns dark, but dark. It was outstanding, at the time. It was the best anyone had, and could have, done. And it became a joke of a franchise.\n\nThen came Batman Begins. I saw it the day it came out in 2005. I was absolutely blown away. I still think it's the best comic book movie ever made. The film snapped in the middle of the presentation. I waited for an hour or so to get into another showing so I could finish watching. And at the end, when they alluded to the Joker being the next villain, I was salivating.\n\nAnd then came The Dark Knight.\n\nI was a bit confused when I heard that the title would be The Dark Knight.\nI know Batman had been called that for a long time, but I guess I equated it to Frank Miller's story. Also, the choice of Heath Ledger didn't fill me with a lot of confidence. I mean, I liked him, but I had Johnny Depp in my mind as a good Joker.\n\nWas I wrong...\n\nThis movie was appropriately titled, but it could have easily been called The Joker. The movie was entirely about, orchestrated and scene stolen by Heath Ledger's absolutely flawless portrayal of Clown Prince of Crime.\n\nI winced too when I heard early buzz about The Dark Knight. One, I didn't want to get too hyped about it because it would not have been able to meet my expectations and, in some ways, it didn't. However, I really hated the talk of Heath getting Oscar mentions. Everyone knows that those kinds of things are randomly leaked to create buzz, plus the added death of Ledger only exacerbated the talk.\n\nI have to say though...I saw The Dark Knight twice. I had to, apparently. No, not because it was \"the thing to do.\" I had to because I clearly missed some things in the first showing.\n\nFirst things first...The Dark Knight is a very different movie from Batman Begins. This shocked me. Batman Begins flowed so perfectly that I thought, at the very least, it would be a smooth movie. It was far from it. The beginning was a little slow starting, but at the same time it had to set up so much of what the whole movie was about, and the length of the movie was already too long, the result was a very choppy, seemingly poorly edited movie. I was stunned by this. When I saw it a second time, I didn't get it as much, and when I go see it in Imax next week, it may flow even better. But Batman Begins was perfect the first (full) time I saw it, so this cut seemed rather messy to me. I'm curious if there will be a different, extended cut of the film on Blu Ray that may make it go more smoothly.\n\nNevertheless, it is a nonstop roller coaster ride of a movie (how cliche is that??).\n\nLet's talk comics.\n\nJoker has never had a fully established origin. It's curious to point out that nearly every writer who takes him on as a character takes past origins and adds to them, subtracts some, etc. And all the changes are from his perspective. As though HE changes his origin. That is why the \"Jack Napier\" character in Tim Burton's Batman now looks to be pretty stupid, especially the completely fabricated component that The Joker killed Batman's parents. I never liked that.\n\nNeedless to say, I was SO happy to see David Goyer and Christopher Nolan treat Joker the traditional way. No matching prints, no names, no aliases, an ever-changing explanation of his scars, etc. From a comic book character-to-screen portrayal, it was absolutely perfect.\n\nWhat is overlooked many times in these two movies, compared to the campy Batman franchise from 1989-1997, is that Christopher Nolan hates CGI. He believes Batman is a human trying to be more than human, which is true to the comics, and that the portrayal of him should be very human as well. From straight combat, to references to real military equipment, to the scars and bruises on his body, Batman is as real as he can possibly be. That is why, when he thinks he has the \"typical Gotham criminal\" pretty sized up on how to handle them, it was very human to admit that he didn't see a criminal with the complete chaotic, insane, without-a-weakness criminal coming. Joker outplayed Batman throughout the whole movie, which was absolutely perfect. He made Batman a better hero, a better detective. This movie is just as much about Batman's growth as Gotham's Dark Knight as it is about the impact Joker has on everything in sight.\n\nIt was also human, as well as tightly tied to the Batman Begins story, that Bruce wanted to inspire fear in the hearts of Gotham's criminals while, at the same time, inspiring strength in the people of Gotham to take over their city, and that humanity saw given hope when Harvey Dent entered the picture. He and Bruce shared the goal of a stronger, people-run Gotham, only he did it legally and in public. He was definitely Gotham's White Knight. Throughout most of the movie, I understood (at least I thought I did) the contrast between Batman's Dark Knight and Harvey's \"White Knight.\" Batman had to be dark and fearful to rattle the cages and inspire change. Harvey had to be the white knight so that, as Bruce alluded to in the movie, Batman could slip back into the shadows while the people of Gotham finished what Batman had begun.\n\nAnd in yet another show of humanity, the Joker exploits every single person in the movie for his own amusement to prove that no matter how admirable Batman and Harvey's efforts were, they were all corruptable. Joker thought the pursuit of law and order was, itself, the big joke. And Joker had every intention of delivering the punchline.\n\nIn the end, Joker was right. Harvey, after losing his beloved Rachel Dawes, played by the wooden Maggie Gyllenhall (my only real complaint of the movie), plays right into the Joker's plan and shows his \"other side\" (Ugh...I'm sorry...I even had trouble typing that one) by killing a few traitors and kidnapping Gordon's family.\n\nThe movie was pure chaos from minute one, with the Joker the only one capable of keeping his finger on the pulse. The anarchy, combined with the history of the Joker character and Ledger's flawless performance, made for a movie that absolutely delivered the goods. No one could have done it better.\n\nThe end, when, in yet another humanity-laden theme, Batman realizes Harvey wasn't perfect, but that he represented the closest thing to perfection Gotham had in years. His \"legend\" needed to continue so that Batman's vision could be realized. And, as all good heroes do, he sacrificed his already-damaged reputation as a vigilante so that Harvey's legacy, and Gotham's path, could continue. He had to be the true DARK KNIGHT to Harvey's White Knight. He would continue fighting as a vigilante, but he would also have to now linger in the shadows even more so that another person would step in one day where Harvey left.\n\nI ranked the movie a 9 out of 10, one rank short of the 10 out of 10 I gave Batman Begins, because of some very small, seemingly insignificant problems I had with the movie. One, it was too choppy during the first 30-45 minutes. Again, maybe I will grow out of that, but I stand by it at this writing. Two, Maggie G sucked. She is just unappealing in every way and was absolutely the wrong choice for this movie. Third, I, like most of America, are a little irritated with Christian Bale's Batman voice. In the first movie, I liked it. Especially in his first battle scene as Batman. It worked, while making me giggle...just a little. However, in The Dark Knight, it was too much. I get that he has to instill fear, so that has to be over the top, plus he has to completely differentiate Batman from Bruce and this \"character\" was it. It just seemed to be a bit much in The Dark Knight. And if something like that makes the audience giggle or wince, it's not working.\n\nAll in all, though, The Dark Knight was near-perfection. I would hate to be Christopher Nolan and David Goyer. It's going to take Johnny Depp as The Riddler and Angelina Jolie as Catwoman to even get close to amount of interest The Dark Knight stirred. I doubt anything else will ever come close to $471 million in 5 weeks and the #2 all-time highest grossing film. The stars (pardon the pun) were aligned for this one. It hurts that Ledger died, but what a way to go...",

Bale, Caine, Freeman and Oldman all excel once more, although unfortunately I feel Maggie Gyllenhaal did not match Katie Holmes' performance.

Jack Nicholson played the role so well that I couldn't imagine anyone ever getting close, and the Ledger name I associated with that pretty poor Knights tale movie. But even though the character is different, so therefore somewhat difficult to fully compare, Ledger was as brilliant as Nicholson, which is huge praise coming from me and a very welcome surprise. The film wastes no time in introducing the Joker (about 5 mins), but we never really learn anything about him which normally is a bad thing, but here it works as the audience has to almost make up their own back-story around what little is given to them. For a movie rated 12 this is still quite a hard edged watch, as the true evil of the Joker is never sugar coated. Bale is a better than most Batman/Wayne even if the grainy voice he uses is still a flawed concept, and Caine lines always seem to be speech based, but overall this is a very impressive comic book crime movie that's worthy of its gold standard.",

Along with an unbelievable cast, Bale and Ledger make for one of the finest on screen hero-villian duos ever seen on the big screen and in cinema-recorded history. The Joker (unlike any other) has now set the bar as the most evil and statistically crazy mad man in the realm of the film reel.

Christopher Nolan's Gotham city epic has transcended the superhero genre and raised it to majestic proportions. What sets it apart from other films in the genre is that it doesn't really feel like a comic-book film. It doesn't even deliver the usual action payoff of a blockbuster. The Dark Knight is a sprawling crime epic that explores the innate flaws surrounding the basic foundations of society and the lies that we have built to hide them. This haunted and poetic superhero tale touches on deeper and darker philosophical themes than most Hollywood films dare to. It's brutally depressing and intensely bleak but at the same time masterfully executed. What I found most enthralling about this modern masterpiece is the multi-layered storyline that beautifully balances the ideas of morality, terrorism, hope, despair, fortitude, outcast, existentialism and entropy. The Dark Knight has permanently raised the bar for all blockbuster films. Christopher Nolan took a story meant for pop entertainment and turned it into cinematic art. A touch of Hamlet in this Batman. \nThe Dark Knight can be summed up by the following words-\n\n\"Everyone has a hidden darkness within. Although we may choose to portray our light side for the most part, in the most severe of circumstances, darkness can triumph and all of us, no matter how righteous, are capable of dropping the law and being the cause of terrible things. And when you're in that situation, all you can do is hope that there is someone beside you, who still believes in you and what you once stood for.\"",

            "content": "Action film with a linear storytelling device. Making the fantastical elements of the Batman comics down-to-earth and them taking an earth-like humanistic form. Nolan materializes this world in such a way that makes it seem believable and realistic, and it's incredibly fascinating. So Heath Ledger was brilliant, the prominent member of this cast as far as I'm concerned. He stole the show in terms of iconography, and only did about 7 scenes. He sprung this movie forward as an off-screen and on-screen presence and it was amazing. The character could not have been better portrayed. From a literalistic view, he was a total terrorist, any way you look it at it. Dicks were hard watching him on mainstreaming degrees. The dry humor, the accent, the demeanor is what set the tone for the entire film. All his little ticks and character extensions like the lip smack and the hair slick. He embodied everything that was so revolutionary about the Dark Knight Trilogy. Simply stunning. Ledger left a lasting impression that will stay with us forever. A career defining performance. This stands as a testament to how great and invested an actor Ledger truly was. The lengths he went for the authenticity of this character, I know, baffled the minds of many method actors. He exceeded everyone's expectations.  He had a single-minded devotion, and he truly was gone before his time. Christian Bale also continues to astonish me. How versatile he is. He is capable of adapting to any field of acting endeavor. He has a lot of mouths to feed and does so with flying colors. Incidentally, he moves effortlessly to the Batman rhythm and hits every beat. He displays some good emotional impact as both Bruce Wayne and Batman, on both ends of the superhero spectrum. The nucleus of this atom is Michael Caine however. He is the moral compass, voice of reason, and heartwarmth of this movie. And I would say, Aaron Eckhart is the keystone the of this film, and the visual representation of the fact that even the so-called saints of Gotham can be corrupted. Once the Dawes Domino falls, the whole impact is greatly increased, it sparks the metamorphosis of Batman, and it fills in the empty places. The film hinges on his character, and I don't get medially hung up on the window dressing aka the cgi facial chop. I didn't have a problem with it like most. I think it works personally. Morgan Freeman, as always, great. There are a lot of season pros with full range of motion in this movie, and then you have Rachel Dawes who just seemed like a pastel. She just wasn't nearly as memorable as the others, but that's probably just cause she is overshadowed by the other bright stars in this sky. Also to give high praise to Nolan, his underlying theme of fear and how it is often wielded as an instrument of torment for both good and evil is so fitting to the story he tells throughout the trilogy. It's got such a dark reservoir and I absolutely love it and the artistic flourishes of it. Nolan ranks up there with the A-List directors and has now made a household name for himself and has set a gold standard for himself. Probably the best, dare I say it, screenplay I've seen in my lifetime. Such a starch film cut. Probably my favorite movie, as well, both perfect as there is no chinks in the armor and it subjectively speaks to me on a personal level. This movie is ageless.",

It put a serious and dramatic spin from the original series. The Dark Knight had a lot of hype. The only question was if it was going to live up to it. And it does. No question. \n\n     The Dark Knight picks up about a year or two after Batman Begins. Crime has dropped drastically. Batman patrols the night, forcing the mob to meet in the day. Christian Bale and Gary Oldman take over their previous roles as Bruce Wayne (Batman) and Lt. James Gordon. Their partnership is making Gotham City an easier place. However a new team member is coming into play: District Attorney Harvey Dent. \n\n     This team is up to stop the mob as best as they can. But even this seemingly unstoppable team isn't ready for what's next: The Joker. \n\n     The Joker is an unpredictable, mentally unstable character who is out to cause chaos as much as he can. And he is just AWESOME. The actor, Heath Ledger, puts on a monumental performance. He plays an amazing villain and is a huge part of what makes The Dark Knight so enjoyable. \n\n     Heath Ledger isn't the only actor that has a standout performance. Christian Bale's Batman is a flawed yet fascinating character. He faces many hardships throughout the film and his story stirs up emotions on almost every level. My only problem is his voice when he plays Batman. In the first Nolan outing, his voice was actually pretty badass. But now, it's become a raspy whisper. It annoyed me. Just keep your mouth shut and kick some ass. Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent also faces much tragedy, and Eckhart puts on a great performance for the eventual Two-Face.\n\n     This isn't your average superhero movie. There is no superhero saves the world, everyone is happy. There is so much more that hidden in this deep, emotional film. Christopher Nolan takes an interesting comic book character and makes an action-packed, dramatic, thrilling, and overall terrific motion picture. This isn't just a great superhero movie, but a great film in general. I absolutely loved this movie and it is definitely the best picture I have ever seen. 10 out of 10 AMAZING",

            "content": "The Dark Knight is, simply put one of the greatest experiences I have had with a film. Even ignoring the story, acting and themes, it's one of the best visual experiences I have had. The IMAX format that takes up roughly 30 minutes of the film is simply breathtaking to see on the silver screen. Watching Batman soar between the towers in Hong Kong was one of the best IMAX scenes I've ever seen. I've said it before and I will say it now, The Dark Knight is a better visual experience than Avatar (also IMAX>3D). The amount of praise and respect that the film has received has caused many to consider it 'overrated'. A lot of this stems from problems people had with Begins, 'it wasn't their Batman'. On top of that, this time there are people who say 'that's not my Joker'. Batman is a character that can be interpreted in many ways, as is the Joker. And I haven't even started on the story yet. Let's go to that now. \n\nStory\nThe story in The Dark Knight is multilayered, but, at the core, it's a classic struggle between good and evil. It's the eternal struggle of the hero vs the villain at its finest. The writing for this film is top notch, thanks to Jonathan Nolan and David Goyer. It's really quite the balancing act keeping all the elements they have up in the air. You have to have the protagonist (Batman) be active, have the villain's (Joker's) plot make sense, have to have a love interest (Rachel) and they have to remain in the rules of the genre. Well, I'd actually dare to say that this film burned and rewrote those rules. And, the key thing to this film is that it actually gets this all right. The Spiderman films couldn't do it (they came close in the second), the Superman films couldn't do it, the older Batman films couldn't do it, Fantastic Four couldn't and even Bond couldn't (Iron Man is the closest). But this film intricately weaves a narrative that brings all these aspects and more. Not only does The Dark Knight do a better job than most other comic book films out there, it does it with a new, ambitious script that presses questions about today's society and the true nature of right and wrong. In my opinion, the best types of superhero movies are the ones who do something else first and be a superhero movie second. The Dark Knight does exactly that. \n\nThe film is about Joker's plot to bring the city down to his level. To show that everyone is as twisted as he is. To show that everyone would eat each other if it came to it. That people would backstab, murder and betray for survival. Let's start with the prologue: \n\nThe prologue is simply one of the best openings to a movie I've seen. It gives us loads of narrative in a 6 minute action scene. That's really what it is, it's an action scene. But it's an action scene that tells a story all on its own. It lays the groundwork for the entire movie and sets the events in motion. Also, this scene is visually impressive in IMAX. Blows anything Dancing with Smurfs ever did out of the water (though that's a discussion for another day). The fact that it's all (or at least mostly) practical effects enhances the overall experience. The robbery marks the beginning of the rein of the 'freaks' and the beginning of the end for Gotham's underground mafias. Crime in Gotham was ruled by the mob until Joker shows up. Joker begins the shift to a city run by 'freaks'. The Joker represents something new to even the mob: an amoral, brilliant rogue with respect for nothing. The Joker card is a wild card. You're always confident that you know the rules of the game, but then the Joker appears and changes everything. \n\nFor the rest of the film, I likely won't go into so much detail and am mostly going to discuss the themes. \n\nOver the course of the movie, we are told three times that Batman is not a hero. Alfred says it, Bruce says it and Gordon says it. \n\n\"He's not being the hero, he's being something more.\" \n\n\"Gotham needs its true hero, and I let that murdering psychopath blow him half to hell.\" \n\n\"Because he's not a hero. He's a watchful protector, a silent guardian, a dark knight.\" \n\nIs the film suggesting that it's hero really isn't the hero? Is Batman being noble by not being the hero like Alfred said or is all of this his fault for getting involved in a situation he didn't fully understand back in Batman Begins? His fault for inspiring evil as well as good, even if it was unintentional? Was he ever a hero in the first place or is he just cleaning up his own mess in the end? The film realistically questions how being a superhero would work and what the broader implications of that are. Batman Begins was about the superhero coming of age story, about a man facing his fears, using his fears and developing it into an ideal he will use to inspire others to change the state of things in his city. The Dark Knight is about how society is affected by that idea; it's about how complicated real life is. You can't just put on a costume, be the good guy and punch out the bad guy then call it a day. For every action in Batman Begins and this film, there is a consequence. The question The Dark Knight asks is 'is it worth it?'. Is he a hero or is he just making everything worse? \n\nSpinning off that idea, one big question is: If Batman never existed, would it be a better place? The Joker was inspired by Batman. Without Batman, Harvey wouldn't have been scarred. Without Batman, Rachel would never have died. Without Batman, nothing in this film would have happened. Now, does this mean Batman has made Gotham a worse or better place? Well, that depends. Had Batman not come into existence, the League of Shadows would have attacked Gotham with fear toxin and destroyed the city, resulting in the death of millions. Batman was responsible for bringing Joker into existence, yes. But, the Joker didn't kill millions of people as Ra's would have. So, in my opinion, despite inspiring the Joker, Batman has made Gotham a better place. \n\nA large portion of this film is devoted to something we really don't see too often in superhero films: the hero's limits. What can they not do? How far will they go? Where is the line that they will not cross? Do they even have that line or will they stop at nothing? Batman learns his limits in this film. He learns that he has to be whatever Gotham needs him to be, whether that's the hero or the villain. Only when he can play both roles and by what Gotham needs can he become a symbol. At the beginning of this, he's Gotham's hero. He's inspired good in Gotham (Harvey) but he's also inspired the worst of his rogues gallery, The Joker. \n\nBatman does not understand the Joker, the two don't play by the same rules. Joker believes in no rules while Batman adheres to a moral code. Though, Joker begins to get through to Batman and make Batman actually do morally questionable actions. Out of desperation, Batman has to turn the city's cellphones into sonar devices so that he can find the Joker. This allows him to monitor the entire city, violating multiple rights of the people of Gotham. \n\nOne revolutionary (for superhero films) event that takes place in this film is that Batman really doesn't win in the end. Sure, he caught the Joker. But the Joker made his point. The ferries were never the target, just the distraction to keep Batman away from the real action, Harvey Dent's murderous rampage. Joker pulled 'incorruptible' Harvey Dent down and brought him down to his level. In order to keep Harvey's prisoners locked up and to make sure the citizens of Gotham still had hope, he has to take the blame for Harvey's kills. Now, some people have said that he doesn't need to take the blame, that they could have just blamed it on Joker. But, think about it for a minute. In Batman's philosophy, he is responsible for them. He inspired Harvey to become DA. He set into action the bold move of rounding up all of Gotham's gangsters. He gave the big party to ensure Harvey's power. He set about making Harvey daytime Batman so that he could stand the hope of giving up his burden and stealing Rachel away. He created the power vacuum that gave rise to the Joker. He tried to make Gotham a better place and failed in every conceivable way. The Joker wins in the end of The Dark Knight and Gordon's dogs are chasing after him now. \n\nPeople often complain about Batman being foolish in The Dark Knight. Those people are looking for the strong, always right, never wrong Batman. But would that even be interesting to see? A character that is never wrong? The greatness of the Dark Knight's narrative is that Batman is often wrong against The Joker, a man he doesn't fully understand. There is no defense against evil, only the strength to not give into it. \"If Batman has limits, I can't afford to know them.\" Is what Bruce tells Alfred in the first act. And In this film he's confronted with the folly of such a head strong philosophy. Batman is all about limits, and the narrative of The Dark Knight is, in large part, an examination of Batman's limits. \nEven though the story does have a few flaws, for posing the questions it does and giving us a wonderful philosophical debate that it does, I will give the story: 9.8/10. \n\nActing\nHow do you improve upon the nearly perfect cast of the previous film? You take the cast you have, replace the weakest link, give us one of the greatest performances of all time and have everyone give double the performance they gave last time. \n\nI'll start off with our protagonist, Batman a.k.a. Christian Bale. Christian Bale pulls off a remarkable performance, improving upon his work in Begins. The character continues to feel as real and three dimensional as he did the last time, even possibly reaching being four dimensional. The performance was spot on and Christian Bale continues to be the best on screen Batman so far. \n\nNow for our dueteragonist, James Gordon a.k.a. Gary Oldman. As with last time, and every time, Gary Oldman brings a wonderful performance. He really is the heart of the film for me. Every second he is on screen is a pleasure to see. The character of James Gordon is fully fleshed out in this film, even more so than in Batman Begins. He's likeable, relatable. You feel for him when he fakes his death. He's one of the hearts of this film. \n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. She is definitely an improvement but not really the starring female character that a Batman film needs. \n\nThe rest of the supporting cast is wonderful. Morgan Freeman is great, Michael Caine is great. New comer Eric Roberts is great as Salvatore Maroni. In the end, the weak link is once again Rachel Dawes. The acting for this film gets a 9.2/10 \n\nVillains \nThe Joker is the iconic Batman villain. He is Batman's opposite. They are so vastly different yet so similar, and that's what makes their never ending battle so compelling. It's a battle between good and evil. But it's also a battle for Gotham's soul. Batman wants to purge Gotham's soul of crime while Joker wants to corrupt the soul of the city (which he does with Harvey) and bring it down to his level. This film perfectly illustrates the true nature of Batman and Joker's relationship and does it with ease. Heath's performance as Joker is, as has been often said, incredible. Simply one of the best performances on screen. Heath Ledger's Joker is already being compared to villains like Darth Vader and Hannibal Lector. I have a feeling that once the film is old enough, he'll be considered a classic and take his place alongside them. 5/5 \n\nHarvey 'Two Face' Dent is an amazing character and this film pulled it off to a t. He was likeable, well rounded, fun to watch, interesting. It was like Two Face leaped off the pages of The Long Halloween and dyed his hair blonde. The character was absolutely perfect. Some people feel like there wasn't enough Two Face, but really, the movie was about him. He goes through the largest character arc. The movie is about the struggle for his soul, which is the soul of Gotham. When people say that Two Face isn't really in the movie, I believe they mean 'Two Face's special effects makeup isn't in the movie and he doesn't have a major scheme'. The Joker will never be finished; he wants to bring the world down to his level. Two Face has the opposite of a grand scheme. He just wants to make the people responsible for Rachel's death pay. People who want a grant scheme Two Face, like his giant mind control plot team up with Riddler in Batman Forever, are looking for a supervillain. This Two Face is not a supervillain. This Two Face is a human being. Eckhart is able to capture the emotions of this rich character perfectly and make us like him and actually maybe even root for him and his murderous rampage. After all, he's just getting justice for the death of his fianc\u00e9e. 5/5 \n\nSoundtrack \nHans Zimmer and James Newton Howard are back once more with a memorable score that keeps you on the edge of your seat in every scene. We hear some reprisals of themes from Batman Begins as well as hear new scores that keep us engaged on the action unfolding before us. Quite simply, this is the duo at their best. If you haven't downloaded or bought this soundtrack, I highly recommend it. It's a soundtrack that will have tunes stuck in your head long after. From the low whine of the Joker theme, Why So Serious?, to the pulse pounding excitement of the Batman theme, Molossus (incorporated into other songs, not its own), this is a soundtrack to remember. 10/10 \n\nDirection \nDirector Chris Nolan brings his vision of Gotham to life once again on the silver screen in breathtaking IMAX. The move from Gotham to Chicago isn't as jarring when you look at the amount of space Gotham occupies (See: No Man's Land map of Gotham City, which was used as a guide) compared to the amount we saw in Begins. What I found interesting about the switch is the more orderly fashion that it looks. It's cleaner and looks very straight. It represents order in Gotham, something the Joker stands against and comes to tear down.\n\n\nWall Pfister once again brings his cinematography skills to the film, capturing the city of Gotham like never before with IMAX cameras sucking us further into this world. \n\nThe directing for this film gets a 10/10 \n\nThat brings the final score to: 49/50.",

Although we may choose to portray our light side for the most part, in the most severe of circumstances, when faced with death, darkness can triumph and all of us, no matter how good, are capable of dropping the rules, codes and morals that society has imposed on us and be the cause of terrible things. And when you're in that situation, all you can do is hope that there is someone beside, who still believes in you and what you once stood for.\"\nI loved how the Joker constantly made batman face moral dilemmas questioning him about everything he stands for and the value of his \"code\". The Joker paradox ,of him having an ideology that there must be no ideology which governs, is so cleverly done. It's the perfect mix of subtlety and irony.\nTo most people, Ledger is the life of the films but I tend to disagree, in my opinion it's Christopher Nolan's writing and directing that's the real star. The action scenes are shot much better in The Dark Knight in comparison to Batman Begins. The cinematography is spot on. The dialogue is rich, complex and poetic at times. It has the perfect mix of subtlety, intensity and irony. A touch of Hamlet in this Batman. \nThe Dark Knight has permanently raised the bar for all blockbuster films. It has really proved to the world that comic book films can be worthy of artistic appreciation. A true modern-day masterpiece.",

The dark knight is the quintessential super hero movie it trumps any other movie in that category my opinion. The movie is elevated by Christians Bale's Batman and Christopher Nolan's impressive directing; however, it's the well written storyline and stupendous performance of The Joker played by Heath ledger that make this movie one of the greatest of all time. This movie works even if you aren't a fan of superhero movies. The no nonsense superhero movie gives you everything you could ever want. The rest of my review is completely based on the joker. Jack Nicholson's 1980's joker was a faithful adaptation to the comics and was fun, campy, and a really great joker. However for the darker Nolan adaptation Heath Ledger made the joker is own and took the character to a Darth Vader level. Heath ledgers signature cackle and crazy persona made The Joker the greatest villain in the past 20 years. I love a good psychopath in movies and when I see a great one I can't help but get excited by the movie and that's why this is my favorite movie of all time.",

Admittedly not a Christian Bale fan in the least, I was absolutely willing to give this a chance based largely on the strong supporting cast of Heath Ledger, Michael Caine, and Aaron Eckhart.  There were parts of the movie that I enjoyed greatly - such as Ledger's extremely dark & psychotic take on the The Joker.  \r\n\r\nHowever, the ending of this movie was so poorly executed, that I left the theater feeling angry.  When I watch movies, I can generally suspend belief with the world at hand.  For example, I can accept the fact that James Bond can get out of any situation.  I can even accept the walking, talking Robots in Transformers - and if it wasn't incoherent and stupid, I might have enjoyed it (Transformers that is).  But, what I can't accept in ANY movie, is an illogical and unbelievable \"human response\" to a situation.  What do I mean by this you ask?  Tom Cruise's character in Risky Business was VERY believable - you take the concept of his character from the beginning of the movie, and his actions throughout the movie fall in line with the character foundation at its core.  Hence, Risky Business worked very well.  \r\n\r\nOn the flip side, George Clooney's character in Gravity was so incredibly unbelievable that it ruined the first half of the movie (the second half was ruined by everything else).  We are all animals and, as such, our natural instinct is to do whatever we can to survive.  Clooney's laughably cavalier attitude towards his own mortality and lack of any significant effort or realistic emotion showed to that end was embarrassingly lazy and unbelievable on the part of the writers, director, and Mr. Clooney himself.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me back to The Dark Knight.  *spoiler alert*  At the end of the movie, Batman kills Two-Face (Dent).  No problem there, he had it coming.  But, then Batman convinces Gordon to frame HIM for Dent's murder - essentially rendering himself a martyr.  But why???  There was no reason for this whatsoever.  I get that he wanted to city to be able to hold Dent in high regard.  That's fine.  But, what the hell was wrong with saying...\"see all the Joker's men dead here?  They killed him.\"  Or, \"we have the Joker in custody - HE killed Dent\".  Again, there was no reason for Batman to take the blame for Dent's death - NONE!  Nobody would do that when you have a multitude of bad guys to blame...and that once again brings me back to character believability within a sequence or setting.  \r\n\r\nAlthough The Dark Knight did succeed on a number of levels, the (always) marginal performance of Christian Bale coupled with the unbelievable manufactured ending makes it an average overall movie that was a huge letdown given the moderately high hopes I had for it.\r\n\r\nGrade = 5/10",

And when you're in that situation, all you can do is hope that there is someone beside, who still believes in you and what you once stood for.\"\nI loved how the Joker constantly made batman face moral dilemmas questioning him about everything he stands for and the value of his \"code\". The Joker paradox ,of him having an ideology that there must be no ideology which governs, is so cleverly done. It's the perfect mix of subtlety and irony.\nThis is far and wide Nolan's greatest achievement so far. It's Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan's magnificent screenplay that really makes it a true crime epic. I thought the dialogue was absolutely beautiful. The cast, Ledger in particular are terrific and Nolan's direction as well is very impressive.\nThe Dark Knight has really proved to the world that comic book films can be worthy of novelistic appreciation. It has transcended the superhero genre and raised it to majestic proportions. The bar for all comic book films has been permanently raised. The Dark Knight is nothing short of a modern-day masterpiece",

            "content": "The Dark Knight might be the most overrated piece of tripe to grace the movie industry in the last decade. Rife with cheesy, nauseating speech driven dialogue, a hackneyed romance sub plot and a nonsensical script that is in every way inferior to that of the titular character's animated incarnations, most notably 'The Mask of the Phantasm'. Christian Bale's Batman is a brooding cardboard cutout  whose gravely cartoonish voice has managed to pierce even the most die hard of fans. Ah yes the fans, we'll get to them later. Granted Nolan is masterful at building set pieces but with such wooden characters who speak in such stilted platitudes and musings about 'redemption' and 'chaos', it's hard not to feel a bit cheated. Obviously the big stand out was Heath Ledger's heavily lauded performance which spawned a million memes and impersonations, which although good wasn't worthy of the Oscar over say, Michael Shannon's exceptional turn in the period drama Revolutionary Road. Unfortunately Ledger's performance as the 'clown prince of crime' devolves into being just a character and never feels like anything more than a well acted cartoon. At the end of the day, Batman will always just be a silly fantasy and no matter how 'dark' or 'gritty' you make it, it can be viewed as anything other than a comic book character. This is not to say that comic book films can't be good, I thoroughly enjoyed Sin City and the polarizing 'Watchmen', which while not giant cash grabs like Marvel, are still unique in style if not in original story telling that plays off the beloved themes of neo noir and pulp fiction. The real standout for me was Aaaron Eckhart, who perhaps muses in the most sophomoric of dialogue, fills the role of the ill fated Harvey Dent with a calm coolness and desperation unlike those we've seen before. If only Nolan had taken the best parts of 'The Long Halloween' and not have tried to tackle the joker until the third film. It's also hard to maintain a suspense of disbelief when you have such recognizable veteran actors like Morgan Freeman (who seems to be in everything these days) and Michael Caine running around chewing the scenery. Plot wise the movie is more or less just a typical game of cat and mouse that spans the course of 2 1/2 hours with little to no pay off in the end. I think Nolan made a mistake using the Joker and Two Face in the same film, as we are taken out of the real story, which is the rise and fall of Harvey Dent with the Joker as a novelty to put on posters. The stupid storytelling combined with dumb dramatic set pieces such as the end scene with the two ferries and the laughable GPS Bat computer which in theory should make Batman's job piss easy and you have to wonder why anyone would want to get rid of such a valuable tool.  In the end The Dark Knight plays out like a middle school play. Very speech driven dialogue and flexing villains who bring to mind some of the worst B-movie type of script writing. It's a film that ranks right along with Michael Bay's Transformers and the two inferior sequels to Pirates of the Caribbean. Bloated, overlong, silly and at best mildly interesting. I can only hope that the man who was once capable of making a film like Memento and Insomnia can again find his footing beyond mainstream drivel such as this.",

            "content": "\"THE BAT VERSUS THE JOKER\" \n\n- The second installment of Christopher Nolan's (The Prestige, Inception) superhero Trilogy is this 2008 'The Dark Knight', with returning cast members Christian Bale (American Psycho, Terminator Salvation) as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Michael Caine (The Prestige, Austin Powers in Goldmember) as Alfred pennyworth, Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby, Seven) as Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman (Bram Stoker's Dracula, True Romance) as James Gordon. This is most definitely the best of the series and for me the best superhero film ever. The whole thing seems perfect; from storyline to visual effects. Most memorable is of course the Joker, played by Heath Ledger (Brokeback Mountain, The Brothers Grimm) who passed away while the film was being edited. He was posthumously honored for his role. In the supporting cast we see Aaron Eckhart (The Pledge, Olympus Has Fallen) as Harvey Dent/Two Face Harvey and Maggie Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, White House Down) who took over Katie Holmes' character Rachel Dawes. I also would like to mention two cameo roles played by Cillian Murphy (Red Lights, Batman Begins) as the Scarecrow and William Fichtner (The Lone Ranger, Prison Break) as the bank manager. 'The Dark Knight' is 152 minutes of pure entertainment!\n\nWhile Bruce Wayne (Bale) continues to protect Gotham City against criminals disguised as Batman with the help of his loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth (Caine) and his right hand Lucius Fox (Freeman), a new evil has arrived: The Joker (Ledger). He and his gang have robbed a mob-owned bank. In order to catch this insane figure, Batman and Lieutenant James Gordon (Oldman) decide to include the new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) who is dating Wayne's ex girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Gyllenhaal). \n\nThe mobsters get into trouble, but have an unexpected visit from The Joker, who not only takes control of their gang but promises to get rid of all who stands in their way. Commissioner Loeb and Judge Surillo are the first to die. During a fundraiser the next target is Harvey Dent, who gets saved by Bruce. When The Joker demands Batman to reveal himself to stop people from getting killed, Harvey steps up and claims he is the dark knight. Shortly after that the District Attorney and Rachel are kidnapped and taken to two separate buildings filled with explosives. Batman gets both locations, but can only save one of them. Who will he choose?",

When the film actually came out, it exceeded my wildest thoughts. There was NO missed opportunity here. Everything over a seventy year history of Joker stories was in this film. The Joker has NO origin. He likes to tell origin STORIES but they're ALL bullshit. He's SUCH a presence that in a film that's two hour and thirty minutes in which he has about FORTY he's the ONLY thing you're thinking about. Christian Bale continues to portray the three sides of Bruce Wayne with equal intensity and levity to the first and Michael Caine and Gary Oldman keep consistent with their first performances. Someone I forgot to mention in the first film was Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes and this was because of how forgettable and unlikable the character was the first time. Maggie Gyllenhaal's Rachel however seems a totally DIFFERENT character. Much cuter and more likable and warmer and friendlier than the original version who was cold and callous in the extreme .You literally could not see WHY Wayne would be friends with her. Aaron Eckhart's Harvey Dent/Two-Face is pretty awesome too. He does a great job of making Harvey a likable guy. So much so that it makes you sad when it's time for him to fall. This version of Two-Face isn't the character to a tee, but it carries the CORE of the character: He's a broken man with nothing to lose.",

The holes in the third film overwhelmed it, but Ledger's Joker largely concealed the weak story elements in the middle part of Nolan's trilogy. Nolan builds a movie of many moving parts which jerks you through even with a bloated run time, but the flow suffers, and on repeated viewings you get glimpses of the man behind the curtain and it's hard to get lost in the story. I'm largely in the minority in my preference for Begins, where Nolan kept to the KISS principle and avoided the pitfalls of trying too cram in too much that are present in Rises and The Dark Knight.\nThat's not to say it's awful. It's better than most of the second tier Marvel offerings, better than Snyder's Man of Steel, with amazing set pieces and an at least coherent through-line, just not the masterpiece it was heralded as in the wake of Ledger's death.",

But at least he left a mark on the history of cinematography forever that nobody will ever forget. Although, what was up with Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel? Sure she had a convincing character in the movie, but when Heath Ledger called her \"beautiful\" was when I noticed that he actually threw up a little in his mouth, but was able to keep it down.",

The Joker is hardly the worst thing that happened to Gotham City in comparison but he is challenging Batman on a moral and mental level while still undelining the need for Batman. Ledger steals the film from Bale but probably makes it better for it. The stunts are made real by Nolan's insistence on practical effects and makes the film more relatable than many other action blockbusters of this period. It is a complex, fast paced film that is strengthened by it's equally complex and fast paced soundtrack. Nolan delivers his best film by far with this installment in his Batman-series.",

            "content": "I remembered my experience of watching this film in the theaters with a group of people and for the life of me, cannot understand why we decided to sit up front as it left me with ringing ears and dry eyes. I remember experiencing this sense of amazement with each scene blowing me away as they pass by. Though back then, I was very ignorant of cinema and I only went to watch this for a good time. Coming out of the theater, I was so hooked onto the film that I didn't even realize that I was hearing this ringing in my ear due to the bombastic sound mix of the film. This film introduced me to the world of comic books and became very interested with the stories that surrounded this character. This film did make an impact on my mid-teenage years and introduced me to things that I never thought I would be interested in.\n\nThe Dark Knight's screenplay was written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan with story contributions by David S. Goyer. The writers have written a spectacular film that touches on themes like justice, morality, trust, chaos and order. They have taken these themes and wrapped it around a battle between two individuals who are fighting for Gotham's soul, and I found this idea to be very interesting. It was finally exciting to see someone that can truly go up against with someone as strong and symbolic as Batman. The first film addresses the importance of Batman acting as a symbol for Gotham, to protect Wayne's loved ones and to create an idea that is indestructible, but the writers contradicted that here by conjuring up a similar being that nobody could understand and boasts polarizing values causing cracks in Batman's values and legend. This allowed the writers to have stakes for the protagonist to be much higher and eventually involving members of his personal life. Underneath the surface, lies a couple of sub plots that keep us interested between the big moments. One of these sub plots include the romance between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes, which didn't feel forced and was only used in order to show the audience another shade of Wayne and an apparatus tool for the main plot. I was actually surprised on how they handled this romance, because action-oriented films tend to really force it in and it brings the film down. The film also carries the ideas from the first film about trust and corruption, indicating that Gotham is still being plagued by this and the people who are idealistic, particularly Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent, are finding it hard to create progress towards restoring the image of Gotham. The film's dialogue is definitely a step up from the previous film as it is much more well written, I think it had something to do with Jonathan Nolan being involved with the writing process, and it doesn't seem to be as pushy anymore in being clear with it's themes and messages. It is more concerned with driving the film along and creating tension, while still giving it a layer of depth that is present to be explored if one is interested to search for it.\n\nThe film was directed by Christopher Nolan who, by the film's release, has already proven to be a notable director but this was the film that made him the important director that everyone now claims him to be. Though I agree with this praise, I don't agree that this was his strongest film as I felt that his next two films were his masterpieces, at least that's how I feel about them for now. Nolan has created a film that proved that films within the comic-book genre can be serious and that it can stand against or with the greatest films of all time. There was issues I had with the first film that was fixed here and one of the main ones was the city itself. The first film treated the city as just a setting for the story to take place, though it did try to create the world through having important citizens be present on screen, it just wasn't enough. Nolan corrected this by having multiple characters who are not really that important be more involved with the film's plot, some of these include characters like Ramirez, Maroni, Mayor Garcia, Lau, Chechen, Reese, Commisioner Loeb and Mike Engel. Their involvement makes the world of Gotham more convincing and it allows the setting to become a character of it's own and show a sense of \"character development\". Nolan also made the decision of using more of locations during exterior scenes rather than use sound stages like Batman Begins; making the world look more convincing and natural. This was also the first time where Nolan has shown his ability to handle something so ambitious. He really made great use of the studio's budget and combining it with artistic license. Nolan has improved upon the action from the first film by making them bigger and ambitious. He also widened the scope of the film by having scenes be shot from different countries and backdrops. The action was not entirely original but they were great in creating tension and excitement from it's audience, particularly the warehouse sequence and the final showdown between Batman and Joker. I felt this film was well paced, definitely an improvement from the previous film, balancing excitement with storytelling. Nolan wants us to be completely invested on what is happening on screen. The film's editing wasn't as erratic as the first film, particularly with the action sequences. Nolan has managed to show most of the scene's choreography and still manage to create that feeling of tension and intensity that was necessary to sell the scene.\n\nThe film's director of photography was Wally Pfister, a common collaborator of Nolan. Pfister has changed the look of the franchise, giving the film a more natural look as compared to the first film that had a brown palette and a dirty look. I found this approach to be much more favorable as it didn't try so hard to be noticed. Pfister has placed all of his focus instead on the performance of the actors, the storytelling and creation of beautiful shots. As this film is a performance driven film, particularly for Heath Ledger, there was emphasis on capturing it and ensuring it retains that intensity until the scene is over. The film also contained beautiful helicopter shots and action sequences which were shot with IMAX cameras capturing wonderful detail and colors that 35mm probably couldn't achieve. It's too bad that I wasn't able to watch this in an IMAX theater as it would have probably blown my mind. Like Batman Begins, Pfister went back and forth with the erratic hand held approach, found mostly in action sequences, to the steady hand-held/mounted style used primarily in dialogue driven moments. It is much more controlled here with Pfister being more confident with his style of shooting. Pfister also allowed the choreography to be more in display which was essential in selling the action-oriented scenes.\n\nThe film's score was composed by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. It still features the great epic score from the film's predecessor and combines it with a couple of new compositions that are just as epic as the main theme. Both composers were able to create tension through the heavy use of strings. They were able to create this sense of chaos and unpredictability with the score, particularly when the Joker is on screen; there is this presence of a screeching note symbolising the madness in this character. The composers were able to create this weight to the story with their score, making it feel like it's bigger than just an action comic-book film.\n\nThe acting in The Dark Knight is much better, than compared to Batman Begins. This may be due to better written characters and a story that demands more from the actors. Christian Bale was fantastic as Bruce Wayne. His performance here feels much more natural and more entertaining to watch. It's the moments between Bale, Eckhart, and Oldman that showcases the best of his performance. Heath Ledger was definitely the gem in the film's casting. He brings a performance that is unforgettable and reshaped a complicated character, giving it the sense of madness that is normally found on the comic-books but grounded the character to our reality. Ledger had a couple of moments in the film where he had to give a speech, and he nailed all of those. I like the unpredictability in his performance as it makes his performance unique. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent was great, showcasing the road to his fall of grace. I was worried that Eckhart might overplay the third act of the film, but fortunately he played it just right. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes was a delight to watch. She proved better when compared to Katie Holmes as she looked more physically and emotionally tough, which was lacking in Holmes performance in Batman Begins. Gary Oldman was again great, playing this character who is physically and emotionally exhausted during the Joker murders, while still showing that aura of hope and determination. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are barely in the film but they still gave great performances, sometimes providing comic relief. The film consists cameos from actors like William Fichtner, Anthony Michael Hall, Beatrice Rosen, and Michael Jai White. I was surprised that Nolan was able to get them just for these small segments but nevertheless they were a delight to watch.\n\nThe Dark Knight is a perfect film, though I personally prefer it's successor, boasting great performances, wonderfully written script with amazing characters, clever direction, hard-hitting scores, and excellently handled photography. The Dark Knight is a contemporary classic.",

            "content": "A very well done and a personal thank-you to Christopher Nolan for making in my opinion, the greatest superhero movie of all time. The Dark Knight is hands down the best film of 2008 and is a personal favourite of mine. Everything about this masterpiece amazed me; from the engaging script to the incredible award-winning performances. It has every element you'd want from a movie, which captures you with such allure.\n\nIt had me at that fantastic moment where the bus reversed into the bank. This exposition was one of the finest; instantly roping me in with the amazing use of camera angles in the first moment and the mystery of the story and characters within these opening minutes. The film is highly script and character driven. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathon have written a highly complex and solid script with sharp dialogue to accompany the brilliant performances. The action and drama are perfectly balanced and is the centre of the conflict during the movie.\n\nAlthough it is a follow-up from Nolan's first Batman movie: Batman Begins (2005), which is also a very good movie, this is most certainly the best Batman movie to date. But in this flick, Gotham is a place of good versus evil. There is a new villain in town and he's not playing by the rules. The Joker, played by the greatly missed legend, Heath Ledger is hands down the best thing about this movie. He wants to take over as Gotham's leader, which causes Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and Batman (Christian Bale) must come together to stop this wicked clown before he causes a time of social unrest for their city.\n\nAs for the performances, Nolan couldn't have casted better talent. Bale takes on the dual role of the Batman and industrialist Bruce Wayne. Bale proves himself in this movie and is much better than the previous actors playing the Batman role. He was a great choice of actor; being a natural and already blowing everyone out of the water in Batman Begins, he continues to bring the character to life. Although Bruce Wayne is covered beneath a mask for a lot of the time, he is still able to convey everything he needed to with just half of his face.\n\nEckhart plays and nails the character of DA Harvey Dent, a district attorney who wants justice and to bring down all the criminals of Gotham City. He makes Dent his own and is very admirable as a good guy. After the Joker has had his way with him, Eckhart makes us feel Dent's anger and pain through his performance as Two Face. Dent and Wayne's love interest, Rachel Dawes is played by the lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal, who takes over and gives a much stronger and better show than Katie Holmes previously. Gyllenhaal gives depth and has substance, making the audience build a rapport with her character and manipulates us emotionally into caring for her.\n\nLeaving the best till last is the amazing and terrific Heath Ledger. Ledger gives the most outstanding Oscar nominated performance and completely steals the show. Giving me constant thrills, chills and goose bumps, his performance as the psychotic Joker is highly disturbing yet simply astounding. He created certain mannerisms (licking his lips) to define his psycho character. His voice and way of speaking was perfect for the maniac who gets kicks out of inflicting pain on others. With his lunatic laugh and malicious wicked manner, he successfully sets the tone for this dark movie about a world that has gone nuts. Ledger is a daring and extraordinary actor who perfects his character and I don't think I'll have any disagreements when I say I cannot picture any other actor who could have done a better job; the act is master class and most definitely his best throughout his career. It is completely mesmerizing. \n\nPutting the amazing cast and performances aside, this is a big movie. There are thrilling and intense action scenes such as the heist in the exposition and the high-speed car chases. I'm not a massive fan of action movies but these scenes kept me on the edge of my seat, completely indulged in each minute of the brilliant and exhilarating action visuals that shouldn't be missed under any circumstance. Although these scenes are captivating, even the quieter moments in the movie are equally as engaging.\n\nThe main theme in the movie, aside of good versus evil, is sacrifice and justice. Sacrifice is shown through Batman and Dent's characters where they both make self-sacrifices for the city. Batman is willing to sacrifice his good name in order to protect the people. All Dent wants is justice, and to take down the criminals of Gotham City.\n\nI could speak and write about The Dark Knight all night. It will certainly take a lot of work to make a film that will knock this off the top spot for me; it will stand out for a very long time. It is a brilliant and chilling masterpiece that would be criminal not to watch.",

            "content": "The Dark Knight is not your typical summer release. It's complex and layered. It presents an incredibly well thought out plot that twists and turns in unpredictable, yet credible ways. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan then build from there. This story tests the convictions of its heroes. The Joker, incredibly well performed by Heath Ledger - their puppet master. Testing Gotham cities noble knights Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and Batman (Christian Bale.) Exposing their characters duality, and then tempting them to betray their moral codes to get the solutions they desire. As I said, not what we usual get from a mega-budget summer Hollywood film.\n\nThe Dark Knight somehow gets better every single time I see it. Each time I take this on I pick up new elements of the story, or notice a new detail I missed before. It's impeccably well made, directed and written. All the cast turn in great work too. The score by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer also sets the perfect tone for this movie. As does Wally Pfister's cinematography.\n\nMovie Prep:\n\nThis doesn't feel like your typical big budget superhero actioner. It moves at a slower more thoughtful pace. It takes its time to tell a complex story in an accessible way, and really develops its characters. At about two and half hours it's also a pretty long movie. If you're somehow new to the Batman legend, you should watch Batman Begins before taking on The Dark Knight.\n\nBest Format:\n\nThis is massive film, and needs a massive screen to appreciate it properly. At home a HD showing is a must.\n\nBest scene for me: << spoiler >>\n\nMany people comment on Heath Ledger's performance, and rightly so. But my absolute favorite scene is with Aaron Eckhart near the end of the film. After kidnapping Commissioner Gordon's family. He calls for Gordon to watch as he threatens to kill the commissioner's son. This is The Jokers victory. He turned the best that Gotham had to offer into a crazed killer. The situation is intense, and the performances moving. The score is also amazing during this scene, and adds a real emotion punch to the proceedings. If you buy the score, the track being played during this scene is called 'Watch the World Burn.'\n\n-> http://www.TalkieGazette.com\n\n-> http://www.facebook.com/talkiegazette",

I didn't know a great deal about him and had seen him in some pretty dismal films. I was wrong he completely stole the show as everybody already knows. I never thought I'd say it but it's made the one with Jack Nicholson practically unwatchable by comparison. Christopher Nolan has completely reinvented the franchise and brought it into the new century. It's one of the few trilogies where they are all equally as good as each other.",

What is so get about this movie is that it is a crime thriller masquerading as a superhero movie. Every actor in this movie is top notch including Aaron Eckhart and Michael Caine. But the actor that steals the show is definitely Heath Ledger, who gives a fantastic performance as The Joker! The fight choreography is a BIG improvement over the previous movie since the camera is more steady and focused, as opposed to the rapid quick cuts and disorienting edited fight scenes in Batman Begins. I also love that this movie deals with dark and heavy themes about being a hero and how anybody can be corrupt. Overall it is a dark and serious take on a superhero movie that is very entertaining and thrilling, and I highly recommend it to everyone!",

The Dark Knight is without a doubt in my top 5 movies of all time, he'll at times I think it is my favourite movie. One of the best things about the movie is the cast, Christian Bale as Batman is brilliant, I mean he's not as good as Michael Keaton but he's great. Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are brilliant. Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal are both great and actually quite underrated which is a shame as they give the performances of a career. But the best of the main actors (which is saying a lot) is Heath Ledger, he is a brilliant joker. He's scary but funny, he's diabolical and sadistic but he makes it sound like he's helping Gotham this way. It's so sad he died before the film was released as I would've loved to see him return in another Batman film he's so good. In my opinion we haven't had a comic book movie villain who's even competed with Heath Ledger (except for Michael Fassbender as young Magento, although I think you can argue whether he's a villain or an anti hero in the film's) the action is also fantastic, I'll take the gritty hand to hand combat fights over big Transformers cgi explosions. I also love the score, just like the one from X-men First Class I often find myself humming it a lot. The thing I love about the Dark Knight trilogy is that each one kind of has a different genre to them, Begins is an origin movie, Dark Knight is a crime movie and Rises is a war movie. This is the absolute best comic book movie and it 100 percent deserves its 94% on rotten tomatoes unlike Spiderman 2 (in my opinion). This is a great example of a comic book movie done right. See it if you haven't. A+",

The action is fantastic and this movie is probably my favorite DC superhero movie ever. It's also in my top favorite movies of all time. Christopher Nolan is such an amazing filmmaker and should be worshiped for his contribution to cinema. The plot is outstanding in this movie, and I think Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is the best villain performance I've ever seen. He deserved every single award he won, and I just wish he was still around to see it. The amount of volume he had for that role was unbelievable. His performance was way better than Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker. (Don't get me wrong he was good.) But with Nicholson you could see all of him in that role, but with Ledger there was no sign of him in that role at all, he completely transformed into the Joker. The movie is just the definition of what a Batman movie needs to be: Dark. It's so impact full it makes you want to see it again and again.  Thank you so much Warner Bros. for letting a great piece of art like this be made into a film. This movie is another one of those very few movies that's proof that the sequel can be better than the original. This one is by far WAY better than Batman Begins (2005). It's much more violent and darker and terrifying than part one, it's simply flawless. This was a great prequel to The Dark Knight Rises (2012).",

They talk about the guy that set them all together and they start killing each member that have done there on the job! when it it's to the scene of the hostages each one is given a grenade to hold so that when the police arrive they have to save the hostages instead of chasing the robbers.\n\nWhen all the moneys loaded up the last 2 guys in the room with the hostages one puts the gun towards the other and says. \"guess the boss asked you to kill me when the money all in the hall of the bank?\" the other guy says. \"no no no I kill the bus driver!\" then the other guy goes \"what bus driver!\"  after that you see a bus go into the hall and the driver and the other masked guy puts all the money in and the driver gets killed when he ask .\"where everyone at.\" Just about when the last person goes on the bus one of the hostages that tried to fight back early got shot and said \"you think your pretty smart uh\" and the robber goes up to him and puts a smoke grenade in his mouth and and reveals that he is the joker! and there is a string attached to the grenade pin and joker is walking back to the bus and drives out the grenade was a smoke grenade. \n\nI going to stop there because I don't want to ruining anything else for you! brilliant film even today!",

For most of the movie, I even forgot it was Batman.  After Batman and Robin, I thought the Batman series would hide under a trash bin and never come out, but Nolan knew what people want to see in a Batman trilogy.  The second after I saw Batman Begins, I knew this series was going to be different.\n\nThe Dark Knight is the story about Bruce Wayne, who, well should I explain it?  He's Bruce Freaking Wayne.  The billionaire who is Batman is disguise.  Bruce Wayne teams up with Harvey Dent to try and bring down the crime in Gotham.  But that means a clown comes out of the box.  Nice practical jokes, Joker!  I never thought that blowing up a hospital would count as a practical joke anymore, but you brought it back like the Twinkies!\n\nHeath Ledger's performance as the Joker may rank as one of the best modern acting jobs of all time.  This is a list where Joaquin Phoenix, Jennifer Lawrence, and Hugh Jackman are the only ones ahead.  Christian Bale does a great job too, as does Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman.  I could go on for days on how good the actors were, but I want to save your time.\n\nThen there's the score.  Oh my god, is the score ever good!  The score made it believable, and it made it seem like a real thriller, not a superhero movie.\n\nFinal score for The Dark Knight: 10/10.  I've heard many people say it's bad, I've heard people say it's overrated, but they can't argue it was a huge success.  It was not only thrilling, but was good on many other levels.",

Gary Oldman did great in this film just as he did in the last film, Christian Bale did an awesome job as Bruce Wayne, he still kept the character in place, even though many people would complain about his grouchy voice, I understand that the purpose of the boys is to put fear into his enemies, and one of the main reasons why he used the voice is so that he can hide his original voice as Bruce Wayne, Imagine a Batman universe when somebody can recognize Bruce Waynes voice (Kind of like Superman being Clark Kent only when he wears glasses, nobody can't figure out that it's Superman wearing glasses) and looking back, Michael Keaton had a grouchy voice when he was Batman, he just never yelled or raised his voice.\n\nChristopher Nolan did more than an awesome job with this film, he and writer David s Goyer really thought it through, this film is an amazing film to continue this franchise, good thing it doesn't stop here.",

            "content": "Which is the best superhero movie ever made? Superman? X2? Spider-Man 2? Avengers Assemble? Or any one of The Dark Knight trilogy? The answer probably depends on age and taste. What is beyond dispute is that no superhero series has come close to the scale, ambition, depth and success of Christopher Nolan's Batman films - quite simply among the finest movie trilogies ever made. The Batman franchise has come a long way since the turn of the millennium. Director Joel Schumacher had proved that with the release of 1997's Batman & Robin, he was one of The Caped Crusader's most dangerous foes. The film had met with opprobrium when released.  It was loud, manic, and more than a bit silly. The poor reception meant Warners' plans for a fifth instalment entitled 'Batman Triumphant' were shelved. That iteration of Batman was dead. Warner Brothers had one of the great movie characters but were unsure what to do with him next.New options for Batman were explored. Director Darren Aronofksy developed a Batman: Year One film and Wolfgang Petersen was linked to a Batman vs Superman movie, however, in 2002, showing how much Hollywood has changed in only a decade, a 32 year old director with only two studio features behind him successfully pitched Warners an idea on how to approach a new Batman film. Christopher Nolan had made his mark with the Oscar nominated, low budget yet extraordinary psychological thriller Memento. He'd followed up with the remake of the Norwegian thriller, Insomnia for Warner Brothers.\r\nAlthough a financial success, the budget for Insomnia was a fairly modest $46m. Nolan had no experience of blockbuster filmmaking but he wanted to give Batman what the Man of Steel had already enjoyed; an origin story. Using Richard Donner's 1978 Superman as an example, he wanted to detail the motivation that drove Bruce Wayne. He wanted to chart the depths of his emotions, and the scale of his preparation, training and commitment. He wanted to show Batman beginning.\r\nNo such thing as a rebootIt seems astonishing now, but only 10 years ago, there was no such thing as a Hollywood franchise reboot. Warners were entrusting Christopher Nolan with one of their most valuable properties in a refresh that had never been tried before. It was quite a risk. But then perhaps they appreciated that Nolan was no ordinary director.Alongside co-writer and comic book expert David S. Goyer, Nolan began to thrash out the story, but time constraints meant they would have to cast the key role of Bruce Wayne / Batman before a script was completed. Angel and Bones star David Boreanaz was an early frontrunner for the role, though Warners Bros were also inexplicably keen on Ashton Kutcher for a time. Actors including Joshua Jackson, Hugh Dancy, Billy Crudup, Henry Cavill and Jake Gyllenhaal were apparently all considered. Cillian Murphy had a great audition but would be offered a different part. As David S. Goyer admitted, \"Some could be a good Batman, some a good Bruce Wayne. Few could do both.\"\r\nUltimately, it was the first actor Nolan met for the role who would become his unequivocal choice. Christian Bale had just finished shooting The Machinist and weighed a skeletal 8 and a half stone. Not ideal when you have to convince Warner executives that the same man who looks like he can't climb stairs could also be an invincible ninja. Christopher Nolan got his man, and with hindsight Bale is so good, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Other Batman films had suffered for every moment the Caped Crusader wasn't on screen. For the first time, the company of Bruce Wayne was every bit as engaging as that of his masked alter ego. We now had a Batman film in which Batman didn't appear until half way through. That's brave. But for the first time we had an actor who was playing a character playing Bruce Wayne. You can feel the real Bruce's discomfort at having to engage in the ephemeral playboy lifestyle to hide his secret and mask his rage. Bale's approach really was a revelation.Nolan's approach also included casting great actors in all the supporting roles. And Katie Holmes. Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, were all stars in their own right. This gave the film a gravitas that transcended its comic book origins. Its cast, tone, and emotional depth made Batman Begins an arthouse film masquerading as a blockbuster movie. However, despite the fevered reception and critical acclaim, the film was only a modest hit by today's insatiable blockbuster standards. Its worldwide haul of $372m was solid if unspectacular and it was only the 8th highest grossing film that year in the US. The Dark Knight Weaker, less confident studio executives might have questioned themselves and their director but to their great credit, Warners doubled down. 2008's sequel The Dark Knight was broader in scope, in tone and in budget. And it's a masterpiece. Shot in the high resolution IMAX format, the opening scene of The Joker's bank heist alone could be one of the greatest short films ever made. Heath Ledger's magnetic, mesmeric performance as Batman's most famous foe, won the tragic star a worthy posthumous Oscar (though how he didn't already have one for Brokeback Mountain remains a travesty). His Joker will forever be the definitive interpretation of that character- wry, manic, and truly chilling. It is iconic- an absolute masterclass of measured madness. It's a film that is as much crime epic as superhero film. It's thrilling, menacing, unpredictable and shocking. It had a running time of 152 minutes but was paced so superbly, it felt an hour shorter. Everything that was great about its predecessor was heightened, making The Dark Knight not only one of best superhero movies ever made, but one of the finest blockbusters of all time. The astonishing $1bn worldwide gross more than repaid the faith Warners had shown in Christopher Nolan. Then came the even greater challenge. Could a third installment possibly compete with a film that was so profitable, garnered audience approbation and critical acclaim, secured eight Oscar nominations, whilst winning two? So many other film series with two outstanding chapters disappointed when attempting a third; The Godfather, X-Men, Alien, Terminator, Spider-Man... For The Dark Knight Rises, the anticipation and hype was unprecedented. The pressure immense. Could the film possibly hit the extraordinary heights of its predecessor? The Dark Knight Rises Christopher Nolan and his team delivered the answer: not quite, but crikey, it came so, so close. Boasting an even bigger budget of $250m, Nolan followed up his crime film with a war movie. Whereas The Joker was the intellectual match of Batman, Bane would be his physical superior. He would overpower an entire city. Tom Hardy is on the cusp of superstardom, and brought his unique hulking presence to the role. It's a hard thing to cover an actor's face and ask him to emote, but Hardy is one of the most remarkable actors around. His first confrontation with Batman in Gotham's sewers is a genuinely brutal and unsettling encounter that belies its 12A certificate. Anne Hathaway too was a revelation as the dynamic and intriguing anti-hero Selina Kyle, a sharp, bewitching foil to Bruce Wayne's intelligence and strength. \r\nIndeed, the character and story arc of Bruce Wayne was brought to a brilliant, powerful conclusion that no bat-fan had a right to expect after the era of Joel Schumacher, and The Dark Knight Rises could not have been more satisfying. It also happened to feature one of the greatest, most rewarding endings of modern times.  Where next, Batman?\r\nLike its predecessor, the film grossed over $1bn and enjoyed almost universal acclaim yet despite the trilogy's success, Warners find themselves with a similar, yet even more challenging conundrum than they did 15 years ago.\r\nWhere does Batman go from here?  We will know more when further plans are revealed about the sequel to Man of Steel, an ambitious Batman vs Superman movie. It's a huge challenge. Zack Snyder is the director tasked with the responsibility following the success of Man of Steel.\r\nIt may take a generation before another talented, hungry auteur is given the keys to the bat-cave, and is able to reinvent a character who continues to enthrall 75 years after his inception.

Imagine one of the greatest crime thrillers of all time which just happens to have a guy who dresses in a bat costume and fights crime. Think Godfather 2 or Heat, with a insane terrorist who paints his face like a clown and goes around killing random people. It's expansive in feel and tone. It's the type of film which you make a point to refer to as a \"film\" instead of a \"movie\".\r\n\r\n2. Bigger, Better, Longer - I'll admit that I wasn't completely blown away by Batman Begins. Sure, it was the best Batman film to date, incorporating darker themes and a sense of realism that the franchise had never seen before. But Batman Begins is also not without its problems. I think even hardcore fans would agree that the film suffers from third act problems. The Dark Knight is bigger and better in every single way. The film is 152 minutes (two hours and thirty two minutes) long, and every second is gripping. Does it feel long? Yeah. But at the same time I wouldn't have removed a thing. Every single second is necessary to tell this story. Nolan even keeps some plot developments off screen which resonate in various scenes throughout the film.\r\n\r\n3. Heath Ledger - Some friends have expressed concern that the death of Heath Ledger will taint their Dark Knight viewing experience. It doesn't, and here is why - Heath is amazing. From the first second he steps on screen you will forget that their is an actor behind the make-up. Heath doesn't play The Joker, he IS the Joker. You will believe that a psychopath wearing clown makeup is terrorizing a whole city. The performance is Oscar worthy. What Anthony Hopkins did for Hannibal Lector, Ledger does for The Joker.\r\n\r\n4. Two-Face - At the core this movie is not about Batman, or even The Joker, but instead about Harvey Dent, and his transformation into Two-face. In a way the story is almost a Shakespearean tragedy of a man who goes bad. The screenwriters play against the established conventions of Two-face's origin story to give you something new, refreshing, and ultimately more authentic than the story presented in the comic books. You will believe that a hero becomes the villain. And you might also be shocked at how long the two-face character appears on screen. It's not just a tease - you will get everything! His computer generated make-up is so gruesome and realistic looking, that I'm shocked the film was able to get a PG-13 rating.\r\n\r\n5. The Empire Strikes Back - The Dark Knight is The Empire Strikes Back of comic book movies. It is dark, bleak, and realistic. Kids looking for a fun superhero movie need to look elsewhere. This is a multi-layered, authentic crime tale. There is more than one casualty, and it doesn't exactly end on a high note. Fans will eat the ending up. After sitting in the theater for two and a half hours, it will leave you wanting more.\r\n\r\n6. IMAX - If you don't see this movie in IMAX than you haven't seen the movie. A few of the action sequences and many of the establishing shots throughout the film were shot using IMAX cameras. The result is breathtaking. There is a sequence where Batman leaps off the top of a building (you've probably seen it in the trailers) and the camera pushes in. It's so vivid and high resolution that it almost felt like it was part of one of those motion controlled theme park rides. Going into the screening, I thought the IMAX thing was probably more gimmick than anything else. Previous IMAX presentations involved up-converting the 35mm film image to fit on the IMAX screen. The footage shot with the IMAX camera is amazing. Even if you've seen a traditional IMAX movie in the past, you will be blown away by seeing a Hollywood action film on the big big screen. It makes you wonder why more Hollywood productions haven't begun incorporating the IMAX camera. I wouldn't be surprised if the inevitable third Batman movie wasn't shot completely shot on IMAX cameras.\r\n\r\n7. Gotham City - The extensive on location filming in Chicago adds to the authenticity of Gotham City. There is never a moment that you feel like you're watching a bunch of actors on a Hollywood soundstage.\r\n\r\n8. Characters - Every character that appears on screen has a history. Even when Nolan doesn't show us this backstory - we see it. Even a corrupt cop that has two lines of dialogue has an extensive past, at least I'm convinced they do. The world is so full of rich three dimensional characters, some of which only appear on screen for brief moments. And some of the characters do have backstories which were provided in the extensive viral marketing campaigns. If you participated in the alternative reality game online, than you will get more out of the film as a whole.\r\n\r\n9. The Bat-Pod - You will love how the Bat Pod is introduced in the film.\r\n\r\n10. Nontraditional - The screenplay is both multi-layered and nontraditional. I was caught completely off guard at the many wonderful choices that Nolan and Goyer made in the script. You will wonder how they got Warner Bros to sign off on the screenplay, and I mean this in a good way. Characters that you expect to die might survive, and characters you expect to live will meet their ultimate demise. Even Two-Face's origin is not exactly as you expect. That said, I advise you to stay as far away from spoilers as you can, because this is a film you want to experience for yourself in a packed IMAX theater on opening night.\r\n\r\nTo me, The Dark Knight is an almost flawless cinematic experience. Is The Dark Knight one of the best films of all time? Yes. Where does it fit in my top 10? I'll have to digest it a couple more times before my mind finds a suitable placement. Rewatchability is an important factor to me. While I do think this film will hold up to multiple viewings, I'm not sure that the expansive IMAX sequences (which are part of the reason why I loved this film) will translate in a home movie viewing environment.",

It strives to take what was already a great starting point with Batman Begins and it manages to be the most brilliant single comic book inspired movie of all time. Heath Ledger gives the most violent, profane and sadistic performance of his short career and becomes the physical embodiment of anarchy as the Joker. This movie will go down as the Godfather of comic book movies .",

Bale was great, but it was an oddball to hear him from speaking normally as Bruce Wayne, to having his voice drop a couple notches when he is Batman. Action of the movie was the great, without going overboard and having explosions for the sole sake of explosions. Using a different actress to play Rachel was a little strange, but it is barely a distraction. On the plus side they do look somewhat similar. The worst part of the movie, (it isn't really that bad, but there has to be a bad part to all movies) is the part when it ended. This is, in my opinion, not the only the best Batman film, but the best superhero film of all time.",

But not this one, apparently, at least going by the tedious soap-box \"arguments\" between characters which amount to little more than lazy writing.\n\nWell, that's the boring part over - the most boring part. Visually, this film is so grimily dark, that you have to be careful you don't have a mouthful of coffee when characters tell each other how beautiful they are. No-one is beautiful when you light everyone from the side. Just because the characters are in grimy darkness, does not mean we have to be as viewers. It was unpleasant to watch, and that must be a failing.\n\nAnd the lighting is not the only weakness. The sound is poor too. A predictable, forgettable score that recycles all the old familiar motifs in an uninteresting way. The sound is also too compressed, making the now also tedious Hollywood \"BOOMS\" sound like they are held back from peaking, which strips even this tired motif of any impact.\n\nThe best character in the film (apart from Alfred) appears too late and all too briefly. Two-face's genesis is fascinating to watch but it takes too long and eats into time that would have been better spent on his blossoming and functioning as a character.\n\nBut again, at the risk of repeating myself, the characters in this film might as well turn to the camera for most of their lines, as the dialogue is for the most part a thinly-veiled attempt at reeling out the dynamics that should have been shown through actions, not words.\n\nWhat did I like? The cameos - from the gangsters to the butler, and to Gary Oldman's sly little part, all were so good the lead actors were spoilt. And the lead actors were not as good. Batman bored me, and was not in the least charming, even in his Wayne guise.\n\nAnd lastly the film had no tension whatsoever, except for the boat scene, which was was the best written part of the film.",

            "content": "THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) was the Batman movie we deserved... and the one that we needed at the time... AND it's a movie that we shall look up to for decades to come because it is truly one of the best comic book films of all time. Scratch that, it is truly one of the BEST MOVIES of all time. This time around the Caped Crusader (Christian Bale still) has been working well with Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and Gotham City's new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in locking up most of the city's major criminals, and overall making Gotham a safer place to live. However, their plans all go awry when a new insane criminal, the Joker (Heath Ledger), starts wreaking havoc in Gotham forcing Batman to go to great lengths to not break his rule when fighting injustice. Part II of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, The Dark Knight is inexplicably an amazing movie that features astounding writing and direction, an amazing score, and hands down one of the best performances of all time: Heath Ledger's Joker (and it's EXTREMELY tragic that he had passed away as well). Before I go any further I have to say two important things. One, TDK was actually the FIRST Christopher Nolan film I ever watched. And two, in my opinion, TDK is the best of the entire trilogy and one of Nolan's top three films of all time.\n\nUltimately TDK is, in my opinion, an examination of human morals-will we always make the virtuous choice or will the given situation bend our decision and result in us doing something we naturally wouldn't do? This theme is represented mainly near the end when (SPOILERS!) the Joker plants bombs on a ship full of regular citizens and a ship full of Gotham's convicts, but puts the triggers to the prisoners' bombs on the citizen boat and vice versa; thereby now putting the people of Gotham on the battlefield, pitting them to the supreme test. Some scenes when the Joker almost has Batman even go over the limit include both the Joker's attempted assassination of Harvey Dent and the interrogation scene-the latter of which happens to be my favorite scene in the entire movie. The interrogation scene between Bale's Batman and Ledger's Joker was mind blowing awesome. A true representation of Good vs Evil, these two legendary characters just merely talking had me captivated; especially because of Nolan and his brother Jonathan's outstanding screenplay, as well as Nolan's excellent direction. I don't think I've ever seen such a marvelous yet deadly interaction of characters in a comic book movie before TDK.\n\nAnd when it comes to performances, man, I don't think anyone was prepared for Heath Ledger as the Joker (if I remember correctly we all hated the decision when it was made in the first place). He was without a doubt the best in the entire movie-and he won an Oscar for the role too-from that epic bank heist to his interrogation scene; I was absolutely enthralled whenever the Joker popped up. Never once did I see even a glimpse of Ledger in that performance. Every single scene he was in was fucking awesome and I believe Ledger PERFECTLY captured the insanity and ruthlessness of the character. He had become the monster, the Clown Prince of Crime! I mean, that first \"Why so serious?!\" scene started to scare me! Every time he told a story of how he got his scars it showed how cunning he was despite being a complete psychopath. FUN FACT about his performance: to prepare for the role Ledger actually lived alone in a hotel room for a month and kept a diary with THE JOKER'S personal thoughts; he also experimented with voices and that maniacal laugh; and also drew inspiration from Alex De Large, the main character from Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. I simply cannot stop praising this incredible performance, it's just that good.\n\nEven though I'm continuously talking about Ledger this should not discount the performances of his co-stars. Bale's Bruce/Batman is still my favorite of all the iterations we've seen and I once again say that he captures the duality extremely well here. Also his scenes with Michael Caine, who plays Alfred-Bruce's butler and guardian-were amazing. I definitely approve the replacement of Katie Holmes with Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, I think Gyllenhaal is far more talented actress and did a way better job with the character too. And watching Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon: a policeman who wants to trust his teammates rather than lie to them but still ends up seeing them, his city, and even his struggling relationship with his family gradually break apart-what an exceptional performance! And now we come down to Harvey Dent aka TWO-FACE-a man who resembles characteristics of both Gordon and Batman... Yet he's actually the better of the two in terms of both morals and life goals. Personally I think Aaron Eckhart is an underrated actor and his Harvey Dent/Two Face proves why. I mean his portrayal of the character was BETTER than Tommy Lee Jones' (of course Jones was working with Joel Schumacher and we all know what piece of shit that guy put out later... Fuck Batman & Robin... and The Number 23).\n\nFurthermore, Hans Zimmer's score is riveting and I absolutely love his theme for Batman. Surprisingly enough the Batman theme in TDK was only played TWICE within the entire movie (yeah only twice!). What's even better was the Joker's theme and every time I heard it, I knew that it was a signal. A signal that the situation was getting out of control or rather the Joker was gaining control, his chaos spreading and corrupting those around him. He was close to ALMOST having Batman break his most important rule ever. The cinematography in TDK was breathtakingly remarkable-every shot drew me in and this also adds onto the extremely well-choreographed fight sequences. Unlike the \"flash editing\" in Batman Begins, TDK had fight sequences in which I could vividly see who was hitting who. One of my favorites was when he's raiding Lau's building and at the very end when he's grappled out of the building and into a plane-honestly I was speechless but at the same time geeking out at the pure awesomeness at that point.\n\nAnd so I declare The Dark Knight the best film of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, in my opinion. I know there are people who love Batman Begins or The Dark Knight Rises more, but The Dark Knight wins through and through for me, large in part due to Ledger's Oscar winning portrayal of Joker. Although some of the Joker's schemes can appear to be implausible, I completely bought into the ingenuity of it all. Though, for example, at the end of the bank heist when he just randomly drives out of the giant hole in the bank and into a random line of school buses....... Overall it's a supremely well directed and well written film that continued Bruce Wayne's saga as Batman, and raised the bar in terms of both superhero movies and film making in general - 9.8/10",

            "content": "The following review may have some spoilers.\r\n\r\n 2005's Batman Begins restored faith in people that Batman movies still can be very well made.The strong point of Nolan's first Batman movie was that all of it's characters were strongly built and the plot was given undue importance unlike most other superhero movies.\r\n The Dark Knight changed all of this,by taking the superhero movie genre in such a direction that it will be hard to surpass the level of respect that this movie has gained.The Dark Knight is not just a superhero movie-it is something even better and something which has to be watched and there is no doubt that one watching will not be satisfiable enough.\r\n As shown at the end of Batman Begins,Batman has to now face Joker(played by the late Heath Ledger in an Oscar winning performance),who is unarguably the best villain in a superhero movie,and maybe movies in general,till date.The Joker is not only one of the most interesting villains till date,but also a very strongly built character in the movie.The Joker here is not some clown who keeps fooling around-he actually has his own reasons which make surprisingly perfect sense if you come to think of it.There is a scene in which the Joker says that if you do things suddenly,people will lose their minds and not know what to do.He feels that if needed people will eat each other to survive in this world-and that's something he wants to prove.He wants to show to Batman how his fight for protecting the people in Gotham is in vain as they will go against him if they have to.He further proves his point by turning Dent(an amazing yet underrated performance by Eckhart)into Two Face.\r\n The finale of this movie is dark,gritty and unforgettable-it is probably one of the darkest movie endings a superhero movie has ever seen.The supporting cast,namely Michael Caine,Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman,are as always in top form.\r\n Although I do abide by the principle that every man is entitled to his own opinion,I find it difficult to understand why this movie does not have a 100% at the tomatometer.It is not just the best superhero movie according to me(The Avengers is not even a patch on it),it is one of the best movies I have ever seen,and it is worthy of being called a classic and nothing less.",

The performances are outstanding, direction , visuals, technical graphics that moved me beyond the realm of a normal movie.\n\n This isn't just Batman this is genius from start to finish. The characters of the Joker, played by Heath Ledger, was so realistic and sinister he must be considered for an Oscar nomination. He was perfect for this role. \n\n Christopher Nolan brings such a realism to this movie that captures the Good versus evil and conflict of Batman, played masterfully again by the talented actor Christian Bale, who mirrors the tortured role of \"The Dark Knight\".\n\n I can't tell you more execpt this film mesmerized me for 2 1/2 hours. The images were so clear, painfully graphic and sound quality that made you feel right next to the action. In a world where there seems to be a blur between the corrupt and the moral makes this puzzle unfold engaging the audience to put the pieces back together. \n\n The citizens of Gotham see Batman as good but also view him as a vigilante. The movie is effective because the battle between these two characters is more than criminals versus justice ,its to define the moral dilemma of what happens when Gotham turns good versus the insane tortured child that is The Joker. \n\n Even the clown makeup is perfectly imperfect as the genius of his insanity forces all including Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), Harvey Dent the DA played by Aaron Eckhart and Batman who get trapped in their decisions to make choices which makes this a psychological thriller as well.\n\n The actors provide powerful drama, character development is not upstaged by the incredible special effects. The moral question becomes how dark will the characters become to fight this evil taking over Gotham. WOW \n\n The transformations are frightening, especially Harvey Dent. This movie puts you in the middle of the action and engages the audience in the bravery and savagery of these characters.\n\n Don't get me wrong the gadgets and special effects are terrific and the superb chase scenes of Chicago and Hong Kong are stunning. This backdrop has and eerie darkness that like a modern jungle finds the Joker testing the boundaries of this cage to satisfy the twisted urges not driven by money instead cerebral games of terror and plot twists and turns. Sparing no one in its path even the love tension between Dent, Rachel Dawes played strongly by Maggie Gyllenhaal and Batmans/Bruce Waynes conflict of superhero or love for her. Its an outstanding dillema that plays tricks on the audience.\n\n The great actors Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine round out this brilliant cast. Morgan Freeman plays Lucius Fox , who stays on top of all Wayne Industries Technical underground lair. Michael Caine gets better with age it seems as Alfred his faithful butler, who is the driving moral compass behind the conflicted Batman character.\n\n It is that moral compass that drives two men in completely different directions for past events that shape their vision of changing the future.\n\n This is a fantastic movie well directed and fascinating on so many levels. Nolan has allowed the Batman character to feel the pain of his solitude and absorb the pain his quest causes all who get close to him. \n\n Outstanding. great performances and just a great movie.",

            "content": "With \"The Dark Knight\", Christopher Nolan has once again proven himself a master of suspense, drama, and psychological thrills.  He has built upon the dark, moody, and gritty groundwork laid in \"Batman Begins\", and taken it to a whole new level, delivering a film with a level of sophistication never before seen in a comic-book film.  This Batman film is also a philosophical film that delves deeply into the topic of morality; what is right, what is wrong, and are they black and white?  And like the tragic heroes of Greek mythology, when faced with these decisions, Batman does not always make the right choice.\n\nAs a result, \"The Dark Knight\" is the perfect blend of drama, thriller, and action films.  From its brilliant opening scene to its suspenseful climax, \"The Dark Knight\" does not feature a single dull piece of action throughout the entire movie, and all of the action is smart, well thought out, and original.  Likewise, the twisting and intricate plot is layer upon layer of tragedy, unexpected turns, and suspenseful thrills.  Finally, much like \"Batman Begins\", the visual style of \"The Dark Knight\" is one of its many strengths.  Once again, the character designs - especially the dark, gruesome interpretations of The Joker and Harvey Dent - look outstanding.  Much like Scarecrow in the previous film, Two-Face looks incredibly terrifying, and I love how they keep teasing his transformation.\n\nBut the real highlight of this film (as you've probably heard) is The Joker.  This Joker may anger many devoted Batman fans because this Joker is no clown; he is sadistic and darkly comical.  It is a very radical and edgy interpretation, but it is the right direction for this franchise.  Not only does The Joker look horrifying, but he is INCREDIBLY well written in this film.  However, it is Heath Ledger's performance that makes this the best film portrayal of Batman's arch nemesis ever.  Heath Ledger's brings to mind Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lector in \"The Silence of the Lambs\"; cunning, manipulative, and calculating.  Lastly, and I don't know how Ledger pulled it off, but the Joker's laugh is haunting and will send shivers down your spine.\n\nHowever, as captivating as Ledger's performance is, he is not the only one amongst this huge, talented cast to give a great performance.  Christian Bale once again proves to be a strong lead and improves on his performance from \"Batman Begins\" by giving us a Bruce Wayne with more depth and a Batman with more grit.  Maggie Gyllenhaal, inheriting the role of Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes, does not give a moving performance, but she is still quite good.  Aaron Eckhart brings great intensity to his performance as Harvey Dent/Two-Face and serves as an excellent foil to Bale's Batman.  Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon excels in his expanded role and delivers a stirring closing monologue.  Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox likewise is given an expanded role and is a fun presence.  Finally, Michael Caine is once again great in his fatherly role of Alfred.  This is one of the strongest ensemble casts I've ever seen.\n\nA few months ago, I said that \"Iron Man\" was the greatest comic-book film to date.  That didn't last long because \"The Dark Knight\" is the uncontested greatest comic-book film of all time.  It is possibly one of the greatest films of all time, period.  \"The Dark Knight\" is a deep, thought-provoking film and an absolute must-see, regardless of whether or not you like comic-book movies.",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN DRIVE SEAL*\n\nI'm very disappointed and this rating reflects my disappointment. It could have been so much better, easily. First, it's as if there's no obstacles the characters couldn't overcome by snapping their fingers. It's just too easy for the Joker and Batman to do all what they do. It seems the writers didn't want to be bothered by realism and it's one of the main reasons I didn't feel involved or excited at all. Batman pulls out technological rabbits out of his hat to move the plot forward - it's contrived and not entertaining. The Joker sets bombs anywhere he wants without facing any obstacles. His team of super terrorists can fill a whole hospital with explosives in a few minutes after it has been evacuated - or was it before? Anyway we don't see them setting up anything, everything is done off-screen and it goes into action without any kind of dramatic buildup. How did his gang do this or that? Doesn't matter cause there's an explosion coming soon. *YAWN* \n\nThe Joker starts with a small gang but in only a few days or so it seems he builds a big organization capable of operating rapidly without flaws - a group we are told made up of many schizos and psychos from Arkham Asylum, as if they had all been released all of a sudden to join him and moreover in doing so became hyperobedient and hypercompetent robbers / explosive experts / terrorists / etc. Yeah. Right. As if running a criminal organization made up of Arkham inmates would be a piece of cake. It would have been so much more REALISTIC and ENTERTAINING to see the Joker having to deal with nutty and sometimes incompetent henchmen and we the viewers doubting whether or not he would succeed and yet pulling it off and laughing all the way up to the last confrontation. Instead he surfs on the action, survives all kinds of explosions and crashes and moves around as if Gotham City was butter and he a hot knife. *YAWN* \n\nSecond, the style & editing of the movie was mediocre at best. You would think the Joker's first meeting with the mob would have something of a tension. Here we are introduced to Batman's no.1 enemy and he tells them they have to kill the Dark Knight. But the way it was shot the scene was cold, he simply goes in, makes a few enemies and leaves. And next The Joker invites himself to Bruce Wayne's party to kidnap Harvey Dent and he simply comes in, Voil\u00e0!, without facing any obstacles, there's no buildup, no dramatic crescendo, the pace stays the same, we get lots of quick shots, a constantly moving camera and even one or two 360 degrees around Joker and Rachel as if this was some kind of music video. There's nothing, no tension. And it went downhill from there, like a typical dumb action movie. Explosion, car chase, car chase, explosion, fight, car chase, explosion. Can't you guys come up with something original? And those action scenes aren't even well made. *YAWN* \n\nWhy? After all you had an ace, The Joker, he should have had some cool crazy ideas to cause mayhem... but he didn't. He lacked the charisma that should be in such a character. Not that Ledger is bad but the character he plays has nothing special. He's cold, predictable and not funny. In Tim Burton's movie the man isn't just some psycho killer, you know early in the movie he's going to do his crimes with style and that he has surprises in his bag. He's a bit silly but you don't know what to expect from him - he's fun to watch. In TDK he neither has style nor surprises, HE JUST BLOWS THINGS UP WITH DETONATORS and he's not even having fun. Bbbooorrriiiinnnggg.\n\nI think a lot of people don't see all the big flaws of the movie because they like the characters and the themes. I like Batman, the lone vigilante fighting crime in his city and his struggle to retain his morality while confronting the worst criminals, I like Harvey Dent's character and the Joker trying to turn Dent into a madman like him to ruin his crusade against crime and I liked the Joker trying to corrupt the people of Gotham and turn them into murderers ...BUT THE MOVIE SU CKS \n\nI really wanted TDK to be good, good at least like half of Batman Begins is, I wanted to leave the theater with a big smile on my face but I left the theater feeling cheated because I wanted to see a cool movie and I didn't, I saw a lame piece of crap. There was no climax, no great scenes, no drama, no tension, no substance, only over the top action scenes we have already seen elsewhere. This movie itself isn't a 1 out of 10 but I'm so disappointed by it that it deserves it's 2 stars.",

Superior to all three Spider-Man installments and even its amazing predecessor in terms of conceptualization, writing, acting, and direction, Nolan's follow-up to Batman Begins is a dark, complex and disturbing film, not the least of which because it grafts its heroics onto the blueprint of actual reality rather than that of spandex-clad supermen. And while such a distinction may make little difference to those already eagerly anticipating the return of the caped crusader, suffice it to say that The Dark Knight qualifies as the first official comic book adaptation that truly succeeds in being a great artistic achievement in its own right.\n\nChristian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne, the billionaire playboy who moonlights as Batman. Having eased more comfortably into a lifestyle of excess, Wayne lurks on the fringes of his family's corporation as CEO Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) runs the boardroom. But when an ambitious district attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) comes forward to challenge Gotham City's villainy through proper legal channels, the man also known as Batman sees an opportunity to replace his vigilante persona with a figure of virtue who will truly inspire the best in the citizenry.\n\nUnfortunately, Batman's success as a crime fighter has generated new problems for Gotham, including a consolidation of the crime lords who once controlled the city independently. Meanwhile, a new adversary named The Joker (Heath Ledger) proves particularly dangerous because he seeks not only to advance the cause of Gotham's underworld, but obliterate the foundations of liberty and order that Batman protects. Torn between championing Dent and meting out justice as a masked vigilante, Wayne soon finds himself at a crossroads between being the hero that Gotham needs and the one it deserves.\n\n\nClick on the image above to watch our video review of The Dark Knight.\n\nThe great triumph of The Dark Knight is that it manages for the first time ever in the history of the genre to transplant comic book theatrics into the real world - and moreover, to examine precisely what it could mean if a person decided to strap on a super-suit and start attacking the world's criminals. The first film certainly hinted at this possibility, thrusting the hero and his alter-ego into a world where Wayne's frivolity was as despised as Batman's vigilantism. But even with real-world explanations for such improbabilities as Scarecrow's ability to scare, this was still a world where the Batmobile was cool and the climactic battle took place on a speeding train as a bomb ticked toward its inevitable explosion. Here, the Tumbler barely survives its first appearance and with the exception of one or two cooler-than-cool moves that will no doubt thrill fans, its replacement/substitute - the Batpod - serves as a largely utilitarian device for Batman to get from one crime scene to the next. (That said, I still want one.)\n\nMore important than this, however, is the idea that Batman is not just a guy in a suit, but a symbol and there are people in the film - most notably The Joker - who want to destroy that symbol. While Batman's identity remains secret and his motives unknown to Gothamites, he represents hope in a city that has little to spare and embodies a pursuit of justice - and further, a code of behavior - that quite literally threatens these criminals' way of life. By throwing Gotham into chaos and testing the limits to which Batman holds himself, The Joker is not merely plying death and destruction but willfully destroying the philosophical foundations of organized society. The closest such examination another comic book-oriented film has ever attempted was the emotional throughline of the Spider-Man films. Peter Parker's struggle was almost exclusively personal, whereas Wayne not only has to find a way to maintain his moral compass, but consider what the repercussions of his heroism are to both the public and the criminals themselves.\n\nWhile all of this sounds lofty - and it is - Nolan examines these themes in beautifully human terms, projecting his examination of \"the hero\" into the hearts and minds of his characters. Wayne, less outwardly conflicted than in Batman Begins, sees Dent's ascension as an opportunity to stop playing dress up and reunite with Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) - the one woman who knows his secret. Meanwhile, Dent and his sometimes partner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) look at Batman's existence as a good thing, a fulcrum against which they can enforce the law and sometimes bend rules to accomplish loftier goals. And, of course, The Joker wants to destroy all of that, albeit less because of some law of movie villainy than because he sees his existence as the necessary antithesis - or perhaps ultimate extension - of the murky morality of Batman's brand of justice. When, after all, was the last time a movie criminal wasn't merely mad, but had a deeper ideological motivation for his dastardly deeds? Perhaps bolstered by the success of the first film, Nolan reaches out further with his storytelling and camerawork in The Dark Knight to create an ongoing, palpable feeling of tension that never relents through the entirety of the film's two and a half hour running time. There is a hugeness to the narrative itself, which Nolan enhances first by shooting partially on IMAX film stock (which will surely be lost to those unlucky enough to be too far to see the film in the format), but he then builds this haunting atmosphere steadily from one scene to the next, building anticipation for the moments when the violence will finally erupt.\n\nThat he occasionally veers into comic book glibness with one-liners undermines none of the intensity; on the contrary, these moments provide a release that is absolutely necessary to keeping the audience from succumbing to The Joker's febrile madness. Meanwhile, the violence is quite possibly the most intense I have ever seen in a PG-13 film, leaving myself and others wondering how The Dark Knight avoided an R. But what is more disturbing is the unrelenting menace that hovers over every scene like a dark cloud. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's leitmotif for The Joker sounds like a cross between Ligeti's \"Lux Aeterna\" (from 2001) and the scraping, metallic curlicue that was used in trailers for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and enhances the clenched-fist feeling that anything can and will happen at any moment, even scenes in which he doesn't appear.\n\nLike few other mythology-based movies, The Dark Knight truly seems to think of everything, be it conceptual or purely logical. Credit Nolan and his brother Jonathan (who also helped conceive The Prestige) for really digging into Batman's world, turning over the soil and examining its roots for possible deficiencies. While this generally speaks to the film's plausibility, they also have the presence of mind to consider such things as Lucius Fox's considerable monetary expenditures - not to mention his entire division - and how and where a paper trail might eventually lead to it. Again, however, these are not ideas or even subplots to which vast amounts of screen time are devoted, but simply revealed, explained and dealt with as they might arise in real life.\n\nBale is predictably effective as both Wayne and Batman this time around, playing both with greater assurance than in Batman Begins (indeed, he and his characters seem to possess more confidence). Though Wayne is a necessary second-fiddle to Batman, he is a better defined and more poised character in this film - even when he's indulging the excesses of his trust fund - and he understands the value of being in a position to help someone like Dent, be it monetarily as himself or physically as Batman. Also great is the rest of the original cast, all of whom seem as comfortable in their characters as if they'd created them themselves. Oldman in particular creates a portrait of virtue that shows a roiling well of doubt underneath, and yet always conveys effortless authority.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile taking over for Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal adds real depth and energy to Rachel Dawes, showing how her feelings for Bruce Wayne aren't simply unrequited, but actually based in both sincere affection and common sense. And Eckhart more or less combines all of the disparate roles he's played in the past - lout, huckster, loyal companion - into one seamless portrayal of a man determined to make things better but not quite sure how to accomplish that goal in the right way.\n\nFinally, there's Ledger, whose performance I suspect will be the subject of many analyses of all sorts in the weeks and months to come. What he does with The Joker is, quite frankly, nothing short of transcendent. Early in the film he explains the origins of his trademark facial scars, and you worry for a moment that the filmmakers are giving this psychopath some kind of convenient explanation, which, talented though he was, Ledger won't be able to overcome. But by the third time he's explained where they come from - each time telling a different tale - you realize that Ledger was a master of his craft, only in his final years finding roles that truly offered him the chance to explore that mastery. His is the definitive movie Joker, and he owns the role and achieves a level of abject insanity that is terrifying as it is irresistible.\n\nOverall, the film does maintain a steady pace and function with such continuously unnerving momentum that it occasionally seems like a second installment. (There are plenty of appropriate comparisons to other sequels its quality mirrors, if not possibly surpasses: Toy Story 2, The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II, etc.) In fact, so well-executed is this film that even the title - or at least its true meaning - seemed to catch its audience off guard, until it gets explained, expertly and poetically, at the very end of the movie.\n\nA screenwriting professor of mine once said that what happens in a story must be surprising but expected, and Nolan's approach to The Dark Knight epitomizes this maxim. He gives you exactly what you want, but does it so well that it manages to completely catch you off guard when it happens. But there really is no better way to describe The Dark Knight than to call it a great work of art because it transcends both the boundaries of comic book moviemaking and even the parameters of good filmmaking. What Nolan and Co. have created doesn't just function as a thrill ride or even a terrific movie, but rather as a substantive and philosophical examination of why we need heroes, and then when we need them, what they mean.",

            "content": "I remembered my experience of watching this film in the theaters with a group of people and for the life of me, cannot understand why we decided to sit up front as it left me with ringing ears and dry eyes. I remember experiencing this sense of amazement with each scene blowing me away as they pass by. Though back then, I was very ignorant of cinema and I only went to watch this for a good time. Coming out of the theater, I was so hooked onto the film that I didn't even realize that I was hearing this ringing in my ear due to the bombastic sound mix of the film. This film introduced me to the world of comic books and became very interested with the stories that surrounded this character. This film did make an impact on my mid-teenage years and introduced me to things that I never thought I would be interested in.\n\nThe Dark Knight's screenplay was written by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan with story contributions by David S. Goyer. The writers have written a spectacular film that touches on themes like justice, morality, trust, chaos and order. They have taken these themes and wrapped it around a battle between two individuals who are fighting for Gotham's soul, and I found this idea to be very interesting. It was finally exciting to see someone that can truly go up against with someone as strong and symbolic as Batman. The first film addresses the importance of Batman acting as a symbol for Gotham, to protect Wayne's loved ones and to create an idea that is indestructible, but the writers contradicted that here by conjuring up a similar being that nobody could understand and boasts polarizing values causing cracks in Batman's values and legend. This allowed the writers to have stakes for the protagonist to be much higher and eventually involving members of his personal life. Underneath the surface, lies a couple of sub plots that keep us interested between the big moments. One of these sub plots include the romance between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes, which didn't feel forced and was only used in order to show the audience another shade of Wayne and an apparatus tool for the main plot. I was actually surprised on how they handled this romance, because action-oriented films tend to really force it in and it brings the film down. The film also carries the ideas from the first film about trust and corruption, indicating that Gotham is still being plagued by this and the people who are idealistic, particularly Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent, are finding it hard to create progress towards restoring the image of Gotham. The film's dialogue is definitely a step up from the previous film as it is much more well written, I think it had something to do with Jonathan Nolan being involved with the writing process, and it doesn't seem to be as pushy anymore in being clear with it's themes and messages. It is more concerned with driving the film along and creating tension, while still giving it a layer of depth that is present to be explored if one is interested to search for it.\n\nThe film was directed by Christopher Nolan who, by the film's release, has already proven to be a notable director but this was the film that made him the important director that everyone now claims him to be. Though I agree with this praise, I don't agree that this was his strongest film as I felt that his next two films were his masterpieces, at least that's how I feel about them for now. Nolan has created a film that proved that films within the comic-book genre can be serious and that it can stand against or with the greatest films of all time. There was issues I had with the first film that was fixed here and one of the main ones was the city itself. The first film treated the city as just a setting for the story to take place, though it did try to create the world through having important citizens be present on screen, it just wasn't enough. Nolan corrected this by having multiple characters who are not really that important be more involved with the film's plot, some of these include characters like Ramirez, Maroni, Mayor Garcia, Lau, Chechen, Reese, Commissioner Loeb and Mike Engel. Their involvement makes the world of Gotham more convincing and it allows the setting to become a character of it's own and show a sense of \"character development\". Nolan also made the decision of using more of locations during exterior scenes rather than use sound stages like Batman Begins; making the world look more convincing and natural. This was also the first time where Nolan has shown his ability to handle something so ambitious. He really made great use of the studio's budget and combining it with artistic license. Nolan has improved upon the action from the first film by making them bigger and ambitious. He also widened the scope of the film by having scenes be shot from different countries and backdrops. The action was not entirely original but they were great in creating tension and excitement from it's audience, particularly the warehouse sequence and the final showdown between Batman and Joker. I felt this film was well paced, definitely an improvement from the previous film, balancing excitement with storytelling. Nolan wants us to be completely invested on what is happening on screen. The film's editing wasn't as erratic as the first film, particularly with the action sequences. Nolan has managed to show most of the scene's choreography and still manage to create that feeling of tension and intensity that was necessary to sell the scene.\n\nThe film's director of photography was Wally Pfister, a common collaborator of Nolan. Pfister has changed the look of the franchise, giving the film a more natural look as compared to the first film that had a brown palette and a dirty look. I found this approach to be much more favorable as it didn't try so hard to be noticed. Pfister has placed all of his focus instead on the performance of the actors, the storytelling and creation of beautiful shots. As this film is a performance driven film, particularly for Heath Ledger, there was emphasis on capturing it and ensuring it retains that intensity until the scene is over. The film also contained beautiful helicopter shots and action sequences which were shot with IMAX cameras capturing wonderful detail and colors that 35mm probably couldn't achieve. It's too bad that I wasn't able to watch this in an IMAX theater as it would have probably blown my mind. Like Batman Begins, Pfister went back and forth with the erratic hand held approach, found mostly in action sequences, to the steady hand-held/mounted style used primarily in dialogue driven moments. It is much more controlled here with Pfister being more confident with his style of shooting. Pfister also allowed the choreography to be more in display which was essential in selling the action-oriented scenes.\n\nThe film's score was composed by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. It still features the great epic score from the film's predecessor and combines it with a couple of new compositions that are just as epic as the main theme. Both composers were able to create tension through the heavy use of strings. They were able to create this sense of chaos and unpredictability with the score, particularly when the Joker is on screen; there is this presence of a screeching note symbolising the madness in this character. The composers were able to create this weight to the story with their score, making it feel like it's bigger than just an action comic-book film.\n\nThe acting in The Dark Knight is much better, than compared to Batman Begins. This may be due to better written characters and a story that demands more from the actors. Christian Bale was fantastic as Bruce Wayne. His performance here feels much more natural and more entertaining to watch. It's the moments between Bale, Eckhart, and Oldman that showcases the best of his performance. Heath Ledger was definitely the gem in the film's casting. He brings a performance that is unforgettable and reshaped a complicated character, giving it the sense of madness that is normally found on the comic-books but grounded the character to our reality. Ledger had a couple of moments in the film where he had to give a speech, and he nailed all of those. I like the unpredictability in his performance as it makes his performance unique. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent was great, showcasing the road to his fall of grace. I was worried that Eckhart might overplay the third act of the film, but fortunately he played it just right. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes was a delight to watch. She proved better when compared to Katie Holmes as she looked more physically and emotionally tough, which was lacking in Holmes performance in Batman Begins. Gary Oldman was again great, playing this character who is physically and emotionally exhausted during the Joker murders, while still showing that aura of hope and determination. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are barely in the film but they still gave great performances, sometimes providing comic relief. The film consists cameos from actors like William Fichtner, Anthony Michael Hall, Beatrice Rosen, and Michael Jai White. I was surprised that Nolan was able to get them just for these small segments but nevertheless they were a delight to watch.\n\nThe Dark Knight is a perfect film, though I personally prefer it's successor, boasting great performances, wonderfully written script with amazing characters, clever direction, hard-hitting scores, and excellently handled photography. The Dark Knight is a contemporary classic.",

It borrows from various graphic novels such as Batman: Dark Victory, Batman: The Long Halloween, Batman: The Killing Joke, and Batman: The Man Who Laughs. Honestly I don't know if I can say all I need to say because The Dark Knight is just a flat out masterpiece. It's one of my favorite movies of all time and it's one of those movies where the sequel is in every way better than the original. When Heath Ledger was the first cast as The Joker everyone didn't know what to think and then they saw the movie and everyone was revealed to be an idiot. Obviously you know I'm going to say Heath Ledger as The Joker is fantastic and it's because you can also buy into the fact that someone would paint their face and act like a terrorist. He was just a hurricane of chaos and everything he said was really on point. He was also so funny and he had some of the best lines in the movie. He really nailed the mannerisms of The Joker and my favorite scene in the movie is the interrogation scene. In my opinion Heath Ledger is the best Joker ever put on film. I have faith in Jared Leto but he has some big shoes to fill. The introduction to the Joker is great as well during the opening scene with the bank robbery and all the Jokers thugs are being taken out one by one and the last standing is the Joker. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman once again are great. Aaron Ekhart as Harvey Dent is underrated in my opinion, his partenship with James Gordon and Batman along them trying to clean up Gotham was great, and they used him as Two Face in the smartest way because realisticly I don't anyone would live that long with a half burnt face. I think we can all agree he was in every way better than Tommy Lee Jones' cartoonish portrayal in Batman Forever. Maggie Gyllenhaal was a good replacement as Rachel Dawes and she does a much better job than Katie Holmes. It's a great crime drama, it's the best Batman movie of all time, it's the best superhero movie of all time, and it's one of the best movies of all time.",

            "content": "The Dark Knight\nThe Dark Knight is directed by Christopher Nolan and is the sequel to The Batman Begins.\nIn this destructive, evil, gripping movie, the Batman meets his arch rival, the Joker! Nothing is better than an intense rivalry between two foes who fight back and forth to control Gotham. Nolan evolves his characters, acting, and action to give the movie its thrilling rivalry between two foes.\nThe characters that are created and portrayed in this movie have an everlasting effect on how viewers will know and view the Joker. Many thought that the Joker could be nothing more than a villain who creates havoc and destroys things. The Dark Knight really gives a whole new perspective to any villain charcter. From the outside the Joker seems messy, crazy and diabolical, which is the form of any good villain. Once we see how he operates and how he goes about daily routine of destruction do we really see just how \"funny\" he can really be. The Joker has a whole new form, the whittey comments, his body language and his pasty white face with his scarlet red smile he is nothing less than a true villain. All of his components have created a monster for Batman to try and stop. Nothing is more dangerous than\na villain who just doesn't give a crap about anyone or anything. In many scenes we see the Joker put his life on the line many of times to prove a point. He doesn't care if he lives or dies as long as the other person is in pain and humility for the rest of their lives.\nGood acting wouldn't be good enough for this film. Great acting would be good enough, but superb acting is what is really needed for this film to fly and that is why the Batman is about to do so. Christian Bale plays two roles, the Batman and Bruce Wayne which require two different styles. As Bruce Wayne he acts as a smart yet clueless playboy who only knows how to throw around money and women. In the scene when talking to his friends about the Batman Bale has to act like he isn't a fan and portray that he is clueless about the Batman who he knows more than anyone else. When he switches over to the Batman character he must be the dark, serious crime fighting vigilante. Going from moneyman Bruce Wayne to scary, hardcore Batman takes serious and not so serious skills.\nNolan does a great job in capturing every moment and every explosion necessary to complete\nthis film. Every action and explosion scene was created and filmed in such a way that nothing was left out. The different vantage points taken in order to capture the detail of the explosion and the characters reaction was spot on. Nothing is better than seeing the whole picture. During the scene where Harvey Dent is being transported, the Joker uses explosions and gunfire to try and kill him. Nolan uses different camera angles to to capture every angle. We can see every explosion and every character's reaction to\nthe events that unfold. Nothing is lost when it comes to Nolan and his cinematography work. From Harvey inside the bulletproof truck, to Batman inside the batmobile, to the Joker and his goons shooting everything in sight, Nolan creates a thrilling and gripping movie that doesn't let you go until the very end.\nCreating a sequel is not only hard, but risky. Everything needs to stay the same, but yet have its own way. That is why Nolan is the best and this movie is the best. Not is this sequel play of of the first one with its own twist and turns it is even better than the first which cannot be said for many sequels. Nolan takes not only his skills and technique, but everyone elses to create an insanely dark and humorous movie. At the end of the movie all he wants is to put a smile on that face.",

            "content": "I love what Christopher Nolan has done with Batman.  The only problem for me is that, unfortunately, I don't like Batman in general.  Even if Stanley Kubrick had made a Batman film at some point, I most probably wouldn't have liked it.  But that isn't anyone's fault but mine.  I just can't take the concept of costumed men fighting crime seriously - let alone, ones that put on silly, gruff voices, and use their wealth as an excuse to ride the most ridiculous vehicles imaginable.   I haven't actually seen the other two properly - and the only reason I sat through this one was because everyone went on about it so freaking much.  And I would be lying if I said I didn't like it.  Contrary to what I say when discussing this film with others, I did think there were many great scenes in 'The Dark Knight'.  I won't bother listing any, because then I would feel obliged to mention the other parts which I didn't like so much.  Suffice to say - and this is strictly my opinion, which I understand is in the minority here - that I thought the film mostly hitched its success via the quirky performance from Heath Ledger.  I won't be a dick and say, \"Oh, people only love him because he's dead now,\" - that's bullshit, because Ledger was excellent - but I will say that I think they cheated in making the villain the unofficial hero - and he totally was.  The movie was all about The Joker - people remember only The Joker - they should have called it: 'The Joker Comes To Gotham'.  As far as I know, DC Comics hadn't intended on having Batman overshadowed by his enemies.  And yet, that is exactly what happens here.  But whatever, I'm not into Batman, they can do what they like with him.  At the end of the day, 'The Dark Night' is still an excellent movie.  I just don't like it, and so I'll give it three stars ... out of humble politeness, and the acceptance that I'm probably wrong.",

Nolans have\r\ngiven the character this great\r\nmanifesto that drives its actions.I will say this sincerely from my\r\nheart: Remember Heath Ledger\r\nand honor him in your minds and\r\nhearts not only for his\r\nperformances, but as a human\r\nbeing and father to his daughter\r\nMatilda Ledger.

This critically acclaimed masterpiece is one of, if not the best sequels of all time. Nolan continues to show us beautiful imagery in some of the best filmmaking I have ever seen, while Christian Bale continues to deliver his dark performance as the Cape Crusader.\n\nThe part of this movie that stands out above the rest is Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Ledger's Joker is chilling, wreck-less, and seems to lack a true motive. From his make-up, to his mannerisms, to his facial expressions, Ledger encapsulates the character of the Joker. Scene to scene he grabs the audience, including one of the best opening scenes that I have seen in a long time.\n\nIt is such a devastating blow to the acting community that Heath Ledger is gone at such a young age. RIP Heath Ledger.",

While it isn't OMG THE BEST THING EVER as some say, it was truly brilliant and he got an Oscar, posthumously, he won it deservedly. My only complaint with him is I wanted more! I have to disagree with the tomatometer, obviously. Unforgettable? I found the opposite to be true. Bland and boring. With a Bale voice even more preposterous then the last. Again, I'll probably watch this again and like it, that usually happens.",

But let's not forget everyone else. Christian Bale is superb as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He really embodies the role perfectly.  Gary Oldman and Michael Caine give great performances as well as Morgan Freeman. Also, Maggie Gylenhall is a big improvement over Katie Holmes from The Dark Knight. Great acting all around the board.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay and direction are also some of the things that make this movie so great. This is by far Christopher Nolan's best film . And that's saying something considering he's one of the best directors currently working today. The screenplay is written by Bob Kane and Jonathan Nolan, Chris's brother, who did a great job. Also, Hans Zimmer provides a truly breathtaking score.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this movie is as near perfect as movies can get. Everything falls in to place.

Besides being the greatest comic book movie of all time, it is simply a great movie regardless of genre. When I saw it in 2008, I actually ruined my first experience. I could not resist looking at some pictures and reading a little bit about the storylines beforehand and pieced together too much of the plot. Nevertheless, I was able to fully appreciate the near perfection of the movie the second time I watched it. To date, it is the only movie I have watched that got significantly better the second and subsequent times. The Dark Knight has everything you want in a movie: exhilarating action sequences, great plot, and fantastic characters. Of course, the star of stars is Heath Ledger, who stole the show as the Joker and posthumously won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. As we know, Ledger died six months before the release of the movie. After Jack Nicholson's iconic performance as the Joker in Batman (1989), few thought that his Joker could be topped. I was definitely among the majority who thought the task was impossible. However, Ledger proved me wrong and blew Nicholson's performance out of the water. Ledger's version of the Joker will forever be the face of this movie and is the main reason it receives so much acclaim. In Ledger's own words, his Joker is a \"psychopathic, mass murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy.\" While I will not say it is impossible again, I find it difficult to believe that anyone will be able to top Ledger's Joker. The one criticism that I have heard about The Dark Knight is that it has too many climaxes. However, it is like saying something is so good that you cannot believe it. As such, you need to subtract a couple of points just to be safe. I respectfully disagree.\n\nFor my full review, please go to http://rookerville.com/2013/07/23/retroactive-review-the-dark-knight/",

This movie can be considered the best movie ever. Every actor did a great job on their role, Christian Bale knocked out of the park as did Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine. Aaron Eckhart was a little over looked as two-face because of the jokers performance but he was Great in his own right. This movie deserves all of its praise, and it's a MUCH WATCH.",

            "content": "The Dark Knight is the sequel to Batman Begins stars Christian Bale as the hero we all know. When a new player starts taking over Gotham's mobster groups and eliminating public figures, Bruce Wayne has to find a way to stop him. \n\nBy this point, everybody has seen this movie or at least knows of the hype behind Heath Ledger's iconic performance as The Joker. I won't fanboy over it more than this: nearly eight years (10 days away from turning 8 years old at the time of this review) and many viewings later, Ledger is still mesmerizing in this superhero flick.\n\nTruthfully, the performances across the board are terrific. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaces Katie Holmes from the first installment as Rachel Dawes, Bruce's longtime friend and love interest. Gyllenhaal's performance might as well be legendary as well when compared to Holmes' lifeless take, so I was pleased. Once again, Michael Caine as Alfred, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Gary Oldman as James Gorden are all solid. I especially enjoy Caine's take on Alfred - witty yet subtle. The music score is fantastic, as is usually the case with Hans Zimmer, and the movie was well-shot and edited. I also really liked the VFX for Two-Face's half-burned face.\n\nNow, The Dark Knight is not flawless. Christian Bale does solid work as Bruce Wayne, but the direction either he or Nolan decided to take with Batman was frustrating. Batman, while tactically brilliant, is terrible in hand-to-hand combat, which can be blamed on the stunt coordinator as well. Worst of all is the HORRIBLE BATMAN VOICE. It's been mocked for years for good reason.\n\nThere are also some weird plot points that I couldn't get passed. How did Joker set the egg timer to the EXACT moment when police officers would fire their guns at the funeral? How did Joker know that it was time to call in to the night show to threaten a particular life when he was nowhere near a TV or his henchmen? Why did Bruce use his Batman voice when in a room alone with Lucius, who knows his identity? Little things like that pop up throughout the movie that, when noticed, pull the audience away from the action.\n\nOverall, I do love this movie. It's easy to get nit-picky with superhero films, but hey, I have high standards for my Batman flicks. While not as purely enjoyable as Batman Begins and a bit too long (2.5 hours), The Dark Knight is worth watching for Ledger's performance alone, and it's worth watching again for the sheer enjoyment of the lore.\n\nFinal Grade: B",

I'm sure everyone on the freaking planet has heard how great Ledger's performances was so I'm not going to say anything. Cinematography is dark and chilling, the music is dark and chilling, the atmosphere is dark and chilling, and even the writing is dark and chilling along with being very clever and perfectly executed.

            "content": "All hail NOLAN!!!\n\nThe much anticipated Sequel arrives and it's mind-blowing AWESOME!!!\n\nThe Dark Knight is a departure from all you have ever seen from Batman so far. It's a new, real, Dark and brooding Batman. A Batman we can all relate to. The Dark Knight doesn't only tell the tale of a masked hero but it tells the story of a troubled billionaire, a White Knight bent on saving the city and a Murderous Lunatic that just likes to do stuff! and a poor woman stuck between all these freaks!\n\nYup, TDK is really complex at the surface but you fall in love with it in no time and start feeling the story as it was meant to. TDK is not afraid to take you on a ride. In face it prides itself on taking you for a hell of a ride!\nThe characters are complex. Multi-layered and beautiful and are described to their audience through the extraordinary acting of every one of them. From Christian Bale's unquestionable talents as the Batman/Bruce Wayne to the Unforgettable, Super Realistic acting of Late Heath Ledger as the Joker.\n\nThe Dark Knight is really a new genre of it's own. It's not a comic book movie anymore. It's a masterpiece of life itself. Not only it engages the audience watching the movie but also challenges them to seek right from wrong. Just like the people in the movie.\n\nThe story is absolutely flawless. To think there's anything wrong with it is just a SIN! The Dark Knight is a story of not only a city but the one's trying to save this city. A Trio of Goodies. A Pure Good. A Lawful Good. And a Hero Good who is being pushed between the boundaries of being a Hero or Vigilante. Ironically in the end he is thrown way over the line and lands in the villain side.\n\nThe film is Dark and this darkness is not only achieved by it's beautiful Cinematography but also the wonderful editing and the heart pounding Score by Hans Zimmer. Yet of all this one thing stands out and that's the brilliant writing and direction of Christopher Nolan. Whose work has made this movie more than just a movie and made it into a Masterpiece!!!\n\nThe movie is carried away by it's talents. Namely Christian Bale and Michael Cane. But those that truly stand out are the new ones. Aaron Eckhart delivers an awesome Harvey Dent. Not only he is able to make you care for him but also makes your heart broken when you see him sad and on the verge of madness. How he played this role is beyond me but the way he showed his emotions and made us care so much for him is an indication of true talent.\n\nWe said all about others but what about the star of the show?\nNone of them. NONE can match the truly outstanding, wonderful and masterful acting of Heath Ledger az Joker! The way he acted....wow. Just wow. Not only you don't feel like someone's acting but you feel like you're watching the REAL Joker onscreen. He's made his mark. He has created a Joker that no one can ever top and no one can ever be. He made his own Joker. Completely different from all the other versions and yet he is just awesome and mind blowing. May he rest in peace for he has created a character that is unmatched and is loved by everyone. A character whose very presence brings joy and fear at the same time. A character who you can't know the truth from him. A character who pushes you till you make a choice.\n\nThe story shines! Not only as a comic book story but as a real drama. All the story is made by Joker's actions. Whose actions change people and circumstances. His unpredictable nature is what makes him the most lovable character in the movie.\nThe way Good falls to Evil! The way Chaos is made and the way he challenges people to choose between Logic and Right....it's just all a sudden wake up call for all of us. This is what makes this story stand out. \nIt's not afraid to be dark. It's not afraid to be real. And it's not afraid to make the hero....FALL!\n\nYes, The Dark Knight is a masterpiece. It's not just a movie. It's more than that. We see familiar faces and familiar things but yet they are so apart from each other. The movie is a true salute to Batman. Not only we see his skills in fighting but also his skills in Detective work and deducing. Truly something we never saw and yet it seems so satisfying.\n\nThis movie is not afraid of anything. It does things it's own way. It's own story. A story that is based on reality and yes reality is dark. A dark truth. A terrible lie that will change all the things forever. The Dark Knight is more than just a film.\nThe Dark Knight....is Life itself!\n\nRemember, all it takes is just a push to become insane!",

It is a story that is leaps and bounds ahead of average Batman Begins and not even from the planet as the garbage The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nThe Dark Knight is about the same idea as Batman Begins. The idea that justice trumps vengeance. The Dark Knight takes this idea to extremes to suggest that justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs. It demonstrates this idea with the main plot of Save Gotham's Soul. This is supported by an internal plot that takes place within Harvey Dent, his seeking of revenge or justice, which is irreversibly broken when the Joker kills his girlfriend Rachel. Joker's actions ruins Harvey and Rachel's chance at love and sets Dent on the path to destruction. Finally, Batman is not only the main driver of fights to save Gotham, he also sacrifices his reputation to Save Gotham's Soul. Thus, the idea that justice is an ideal that must be protected at all costs is demonstrated. Justice as an ideal must be protected even with Rachel's death, with Dent's false hero status, and with Batman giving up his reputation.\n\nIt's a great story and a triumph of movie making in the age of fluff and crap. Too bad the final part of the trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises turns out to be as empty as this one is full.\n\nMy Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.",

Dark and mesmerizing, \"The Dark Knight\" runs for two and a half hours and never begs for an ending.  It's so much more than a great comic book adaptation or even the best Batman movie- it's a sprawling, original crime drama that exists in it's own totally immersing world. My only gripe is with the replacement of Katie Holmes with Maggie Gyllenhaal for the character of Rachel Dawes. Gyllenhaal is much less likeable, even annoying at times, and therefore (SPOILER ALERT) detracts greatly from the tragedy of her death. Other than that, this is pure unforgettable excellence.",

I'm personally stuck on which is my favourite of the three films as they all seem to share the same level of consistency and brilliance. That's all down to how epic each of them are and how great a director Christopher Nolan is. The Dark Knight continues the story of Bruce Wayne/Batman in great spectacular fashion with a gripping plot and terrific performances. Ledger's role in the film is admittedly a bit hyped too much due to his death a few months shy of its release yet there's no denying how much of a powerful piece of acting he delivers with the character. He's twisted and unpredictable and remains the best live action version of the character. Aaron Eckhart also plays Harvey Dent terrifically as the tragic figure he was in the comics instead of Tommy Lee Jones' campy miscast in Batman Forever. Gary Oldman really stands out among the returning cast as Gordon, really benefiting from his increased screen time in this picture. The action once again is amazing and the cinematography is eye-catching. It's probably the first ever superhero film to actually feel like it's in our present day world as well with pretty much no fantastical elements present. It's a great superhero drama and worthy of its status as one of the top films in the genre.",

It is much more than a typical superhero film, it actually sets the mark for what a superhero film can be, but more than that, it is a masterfully crafted thriller that is also a Shakespearean tragedy. It is so hard to pick out what is the best part about this film, because the direction is near perfect, the script is fantastic, the cinematography is stunning, and the acting is absolutely remarkable. Nolan proves to everyone that he is one of the best writer/directors alive with this film, he and his brother, Jonathan, wrote the screenplay for it, and they have written a character driven film that makes us look further into the shady nature of right and wrong, and the psychology that makes each person tick. But the first character that I have to speak of is The Joker, both Heath Ledger and the Nolan brothers succeed at making one of the most sadistic and anarchic characters ever to be in a film. He is a mass murdering nihilistic psychopath, he literally wants nothing besides terror and chaos, money means nothing to him, and lives don't mean anything, possibly the only thing that does matter to him is the game he is playing with Batman. And I like that the Nolans chose to use that element of the character, because that is really all that has fueled The Joker throughout the history of Batman, his only goal has been to make Batman break his only rule and give in to the chaos that he has created. The Joker is the greatest villain ever invented to compliment his hero counterpart, and The Dark Knight shows us why, he and Batman are not just a good vs. evil duel, it is an endless game of one trying to break the other, and neither ever succeeding, in short, it is the greatest good vs. evil parable ever told. And not just because it is emotionally gripping and entertaining, but because it is probably the most accurate representation of how the two mingle in this ever-changing world, it shows us the vagueness of what is good, and the absolution of what is evil, which is something that The Dark Knight makes very clear to us. However, The Joker would not have been as truly terrifying and human if Heath Ledger had not given everything he had into the role, there is no instinct for self-preservation in his performance, he devotes himself so thoroughly to his role that it is as if he actually became as insane as The Joker. Honestly, it is very hard to even tell that it is Heath Ledger, his voice, body language, and the look in his eyes are not the same as the Heath Ledger we have seen in other films, they are something that is far more sinister and vindictive than anything else we have seen. But Ledger's performance is not the only one to be praised, Eckhart, Bale, Caine, and Oldman all gave terrific performances that would be gold in any other film, but Ledger just stole the show, it truly is one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. To conclude, The Dark Knight is a film that will appeal to everyone, but it is a film that will not be properly appreciated by its audience for its artistic expression.",

Best film of 2008, Heath Ledger owns and it's a damn shame we'll never see him act again, the screenplay, music, acting, action, pace, meaning and weight...all of it kills. Actually, I have one criticism: why does Batman costume still suck? I mean it, why is he wearing a bulky suit of armour? He's a dude that's supposed to be diving into the shadows and avoiding bullets. This does not harm the film, but dude, that's annoying. And somebody needs to tell Bale to lay off with that Slayer impression he's doing. It's unintentionally funny and it can't be good for his throat either.

            "content": "When Christopher Nolan brought Batman back to the big screens in 2005 with his reboot Batman Begins, audiences were blown away by how smart, dark, gritty, and realistic the film was, despite some script issues. Flash forward to 2008 and Nolan brings to us The Dark Knight. The film begins with a bank robbery, and serves as one of the most memorable introductions to a villain in film. In these first few minutes, you can tell what kind of film this will be. The film is even more dark and gritty than its predecessor, and is certainly not the Batman of the 80's. The stand out performance of the film is, without a doubt, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. His performance is definitely worthy of his late Oscar, as he completely embodies Nolan's version of the Joker. Every actor in this film brings something unique and interesting to the table. The direction of this film is also fantastic. Each scene is filled with a sense of urgency and realism, despite the somewhat fantastical nature of the situations. Overall, Nolan has crafted a phenomenal, gritty sequel that features a surprising amount of depth and works on every level imaginable.",

This movie he steps into is much much darker and you cannot believe your eyes when someone who has to pass the test for making a sequel to hands down one of the best batman movies ever,just aces the test with flying colors. The creativeness of the joker and his manipulative ways of destruction are unique and you gaze upon someone who you truly feel is in a league of his own in this performance it is remembered as one of my all time favorites. He's complex,and every scene your eager to see whats in store next for Heath Ledger as he is the bright star in the acting portrayel. Christain Bale brings everything you could want in Batman,he is the Batman hands down best we've had and i think the best we\"ll ever see,for your voice to go out doing your scenes manipulating your character and making your lines on the script says it in its own  mean,just breathtaking as well and compliments Ledgers performance very well. The Nolan brothers wrote this story different from Batman Begins and didn't miss a step they executed with everything from the opening scene to the last frame of the movie,you admire the skill and while your watching you never get a sense less than perfect. It moves swiftly and grips you in for the best ride you would have for 2008 and never lets go,you'll want more you'll beg for more when this movie comes to its conclusion because a time doesn't come when you come to appreciate a movie so finely made with its characters,main and supporting. Its story you yearn to continue,its hype doesn't disappoint you'll be impressed with every aspect of the movie and then some. Nolan created a masterpiece in this film here your average filmmakers look like just dog shit compared to his vision,his style,his skill is his craftsmanship as a filmmaker and there wont be any other like him. Great Screenplay,Great Acting,Great Director. No wonder this sits atop rankings of quite possibly top 10 greatest movies ever made.",

            "content": "The superhero movie genre, for all its innovation and accomplishments, will probably never receive the respect or recognition that other genres enjoy amongst professional circles, which is somewhat odd considering that even something as lacking in resonance as The Graduate can achieve placement on the American Film Institute's top 100 films list. This was evident in 2009 when, in the most overt joke of an Oscars ceremony, the second entry in the modern Batman trilogy was not considered for the coveted best picture award, with a nomination inexplicably going to The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This was not the first example of an excellent film being snubbed (Hoop Dreams suffered similar treatment in 1995), but then again the Academy's actions are not the subject here. \n\nThis is something I am only saying after giving it a good amount of thought: The Dark Knight is one of the great movies of all time. The reason I am bold enough to say that is because, plainly, it stands at the pinnacle of its genre. I believe most any genre, with a few exceptions, is capable of producing greatness, and no one would have to think too hard to realize that. There are animated classics, horror classics, comedy classics and even giant-monster classics. The superhero genre being unable to achieve similar heights is simply ludicrous to me. But, excellent quality is not sufficient to achieve what I am talking about. What makes The Dark Knight a classic in its own right is that it transcends its origins and reinvents the possibilities of what a movie of this type can be. \n\nThe story of the film, ultimately, is about consequences, a theme that is rarely explored in these adaptations. Batman's actions cause the mob to unleash the Joker on the city, leading to all kinds of casualties. An idealistic district attorney becomes corrupted, a city turns against its defender, the hero loses his hope for a normal life and is even tempted to break his own moral code, all consequences of one radical move against crime. It is this running theme that makes this sequel an effective follow up to the events of its predecessor, while at the same time presenting its own distinct story, and a rather strong one at that. More so than any other film starring the titular character, The Dark Knight explores the inherent difficulties that a superhero faces in trying to eradicate organized crime from a place as corrupt as Gotham, taking a few unexpected turns along the way. It draws you into this world that, while not exactly realistic, feels somewhat plausible due to the overall treatment of the material and depth of the screenplay. \n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the film, in my eyes, is actually the setting. While it lacks the style and gothic architecture of Tim Burton's 1989 film, it is nonetheless a more brooding and dangerous place. One of the things director Christopher Nolan deserves credit for is bringing the city of Gotham to life like never before. We finally get an idea of the people of the city and what they are going through, such that Gotham becomes a character itself that is just as dynamic as any member of the cast, and in this film it appears more stable than before but quickly reveals an undercurrent of danger. We get to see how everyone is affected by the situation: the elite, the civilians and the criminals. There is a very real sense of paranoia and distrust that pervades the city, conveyed well by some of the conversations. My favorite is the one between Harvey Dent and Rachel Dawes over the phone after Gordon's supposed death. This is fitting, as it brings us an idea of what it would be like to work in such a corrupted city. All of the 90's live action films failed to capture this, which is just one testament that The Dark Knight, along with its two companion pieces, boasts a nearly unprecedented understanding of the essence of the world of Batman. Of course, there has to be some action sequences but thanks to the art direction and cinematography they are more potent than one would expect. Unlike in The Avengers, when there is an explosion here it really feels like something bad just happened.\n\nAs anyone who has seen it will attest to this is a very grim motion picture, but this in and of itself does not guarantee quality, which is a misconception that is unfortunately too common. That would sustain the notion that a film like Return to Oz is better than The Wizard of Oz. What matters is whether such a tone is faithful to the spirit ofwhat has been adapted. With Batman Begins a fittingly serious approach was taken with the material, yet the feel of a comic book remained. The Dark Knight pushes the envelope in this area and includes some genuinely chilling scenes. Many involving the villain fall into this category, but two that I believe deserve mention are Alfred's recounting of an incident in the Congo and Harvey Dent's very questionable interrogation of a random thug. With the former you get an idea of how great the approaching threat is, and the latter is impacting because of its contrast to what has already been seen of Dent. For a moment, we are reminded of his ultimate fate.\n\n\tThe cast is consistently excellent, although the reception to it carries a bit of irony. Unlike with Iron Man, where the lead performance was so good that most were willing to overlook that the rest of the cast was generally unimpressive, the villain's performance here is so good that most fail to recognize what impressive work the rest of the cast brings. Bruce Wayne's tale of a very troubled man who was driven to do something unconventional is expanded upon to cover the times where he begins to doubt whether his methods and decisions were justified. This contributes to what is one of the most insightful portrayals the character has seen in an adaptation. The same can be said for much of the supporting cast, particularly of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman as the voices of reason in Bruce Wayne's life, the former being very effective in several somber scenes. Because of this, the relationships within the film are surprisingly well developed and intricate. Harvey Dent does not have much respect for Wayne, but admires Batman. James Gordon initially trusts all of his allies, but grows more desperate as that trust seems increasingly misplaced. All 3 of these people sustain the trials of this crisis and by the time the final scenes come it is fascinating to look back on what drastic changes have taken place. But the most notable dynamic in the film is, of course, that between Batman and the Joker. The conflict between these two is eventually revealed to be more than one of interests: it is one of ideologies. Both are haunted individuals who have experienced something grave in their pasts and have been driven to extreme actions. Yet, they are polar opposites battling for the soul of a city. One believes in the salvation of that city, the other seeks to prove that it will never come. The original 1989 Batman film had the potential to mine an interesting hero/villain dynamic, given that in that adaptation these two were responsible for each others existence, but that was pushed to the side in favor of typical comic-book thrills. With The Dark Knight, we understand exactly why these two will not kill the other and how it is they regard one another. I think it is interesting that out of all the people in the film, the one with whom the Joker is most honest is Batman.\n\nContrary to popular belief, this is not exactly a thought provoking film. You won't find the answers to some of life's big questions here, even though there are some neat insights into the nature of heroism and the tendencies of people. This is rather a movie that uses ideas to simply tell a story. When the characters make the claim that elected officials are preferable to outlaws it is not a statement on social matters, it is supposed to create a plausible dilemma for the hero. In other words, this tale is told with uncommon depth and intelligence, and it speaks to us because \"these stories touch on deep fears, traumas, fantasies and hopes\", as Roger Ebert put it. \n\nIf I had to pick out any problem, it would be that the rescue portion of the climax goes on a bit too long and suffers from the type of editing that makes it easy to lose your place during the action if you let your mind wander for a moment. It is not as engaging as some earlier sequences, but is redeemed by the final confrontation between the two combatants and a knockout falling resolution. Even so, this is a comparatively minor misstep and the people that worked on this film can continue their careers with the assurance that they helped bring what remains the strongest superhero film to date and one of the best sequels ever made.",

            "content": "Wednesday, June 19, 2013\r\n\r\n(2008) The Dark Knight\r\nACTION/ ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n  Quite a rebellious step for writer/ director of Christopher Nolan which may be one of the darkest super hero films ever made and may have caught me off guard centering on Nolan's reinvention of the character of Batman returning for a second installment to go after a new villain called \"The Joker\" (and the eventual arrival of \"Two Face\" who is self explainable) who is a known foe of the made up city of Gotham City. Right at the beginning, Nolan mocks people in general who idolize him since he's known to be a super hero to both the city and to the viewers where he goes after not just the criminals but also to the people who dress like him- this is a serious criticism to all the super hero fanatics who assume and think they can be like him too just because he's wearing a costume.  There's a new villain in which we don't know too much about, his name is the Joker played by the scary looking Heath Ledger who looks like he's wearing unwashed chemical paint on his face where we 're oblivious how it got their or that theirs is no real background revelation except to say that he's psychotic and loves to create fear- this was very evident when he burns up the currency after robbing one of Gotham's biggest bank's as well as execute any of his goons who sought it.   And the reason why I say that The Joker is not quite developed here is because on the first Batman movie \"Batman Begins\" the two super villains shown and introduced are somewhat self explainable who are Ra's Al Ghul and the Scarecrow.   Although, some of us still remember the persona of \"The Joker\" from Tim Burton's Batman movie starring Jack Nicolson as well as the campy 1970's TV show, this kind of Joker has a whole new persona. Here where he's bent on using his ingenuity instead of using gadgets which is defined as pre-planned traps and it has been used as part of his obsession where he manages to rig up bombs in buildings.  They're somewhat inhuman and abnormal that can sometimes be defined as a terrorist.  He's definitely has something up his sleeve and we don't know what it is but it's expected to be catastrophic making the audience wonder if the Joker is going to succeed or whether or not \"The Dark Knight\" can even prevent him from achieving this goal.  \r\n \r\nUpon seeing this movie in theatres, I haven't had any real desire to see it again on DVD not because it's not a well made movie but because I already get what Nolan is conveying, and it's entire atmosphere as well as it's approach is the opposite of \"Batman Begins\" and I should've expected that by looking at the movie's title \"The Dark Knight\".  I'm also aware that some had complained because theirs a lack of action sequences in it but that may be in fact Nolan's intention in the first place. One kid in the audience said 'holy smokes' on just one sequence and it regarded a truck flipping over saying that Nolan may have revolutionized how people should look at super heroes or heroes in general because it should \"not\" have to be faithful to what people have previously seen, read and look at because if you look at the current crop of super heroes or heroes in films such as Iron Man and \"Skyfall\"(because of the preplanned traps like the Joker and portraying Bond as being imperfect just like Wayne) and so forth some have exceeded a lot better than expected all thanks to Nolan for humanizing both the characters as well as it's story first.  \r\n \r\n3.5 out of 4 stars",

            "content": "\"The Dark Knight\" is the pinnacle of superhero movies and a masterpiece of any genre. It is one of my favorite all time movies for many reasons. The level of sophistication in this movie and its adult themes leave all other movies in the genre in the genre. The intertwining character arcs propel the plot. The most heartbreaking of these is the fall of Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Batman (Christian Bale) and Gordon (Gary Oldman) complete a triad of \"good\" characters who are forever changed by the mechinations of the Joker, played by the phenomenal Health Ledger. Ledger is not just acting; he is channeling something very dark and frightening.\n\n\"The Dark Knight\" is of course exciting and action-packed, but the dialogue is sharp, the plot is insightfully modern, and the outcome is devastating. The modernity is present in the scenes set in Hong Kong, an acknowledgement of just how central China has become to both the movie industry and geopolitics. There is also an exploration of surveillance in our society and the lengths society will go to keep the status quo. What Batman becomes at the end reflects these complexities and our modern conception of heroes, anti-heroes, and villains.\n\nBut maybe I am not hyping this movie enough. The supporting characters are all given something important to do, including the members of the mafia and other criminal organizations in Gotham. The Joker's reign of chaos is as much aimed at the criminals of Gotham as it is against authority and society. What he accomplishes by the end of the movie forces Bruce Wayne to an entirely different level of hero, but not without great cost. This is not a movie where the hero wins and the villain loses.\n\nWhat makes this one of the greatest movies of all time is the full repertoire of emotions, tones, and themes that Nolan deftly constructs into a complex journey without an easy ending. There are scenes of suspense and tension as horrifying as anything in horror, exhilarating chase scenes, several moments of thoughtful reflection, difficult decisions made by complex characters, heartbreaking losses, witty humor, the best moments between Bruce and Alfred yet, an opening and an ending that flow smoothly and inevitably, and a bewildering number of themes grounded in the complexity of unfolding events in a huge modern city.\n\nWill there ever be another superhero movie that works on so many levels and transcends its genre? I am actually pretty doubtful. There have certainly been subsequence superhero movies that I have rated 5-stars, but although they are among my favorites, they don't rise above the trappings of this particular genre in the way that \"The Dark Knight\" does. Even \"The Dark Night Rises,\" although a satisfying conclusion to Nolan's extraordinary Batman trilogy doesn't quite reach the heights of this movie.\n\nYears and many viewings later, \"The Dark Knight\" remains to me an astonishing achievement in the history of film, and it continues to point to the future of filmmaking.",

Let's throw in the Joker said Nolan. \nThe Dark Knight. The sequel to 2005's Batman Begins. Story starts off with a bank heist lead by men wearing clown masks and and soon we learn it's the mobs bank. Turns out one of the masked men is the Joker himself played by Heath Ledger and from there our movie begins. The tone is set and we know how this movie is going to play out. \nChristian Bale returns as the cape crusader and does his normal fine job but it's mainly Heath Ledger who stole the spot light with his creepy acting skills and that terrifying laughter of his. In my opinion a way better joker than Jack Nickolsan. As for Christopher Nolan and the story, a MUCH better telling and directing. Was very into it and felt a lot of key points of emotion when there was any, along with the epic-ness of certain scenes filmed in IMAX. \nThis is the film that pretty much changed the game for superhero films that need to be more serious or a darker tone than the usual upbeat ones. Minus Marvel because they're still doing everything right but as for this Batman trilogy, it fits perfectly. \nImpressive film, good acting, and leaves you wanting more.

Including, one thing I was not sure about was Heath Ledger as The Joker, don get me wrong, he was terrific in Brokeback Mountain and The Patriot as his other films. Heath Ledger stole this movie with the dialogue he was given, his lines are truly haunting and ruthless and funny. The Dark Knight has no flaw for me, 5 out of 5 stars",

The dialogue is overwhelming and again not as sophisticated as Nolan thinks it is. It admittedly has some very strong sequences and themes, but overall it's a shore to sit through. Harvey Dent is a failure of a character, Bale continues to be a mediocre Batman and Heath Ledger's Joker is one of the most overrated characters in the history of cinema. He's just an anarchist and never Joker himself while the performance is just serviceable and far from glorious.

            "content": "If Batman Begins reinvented the character of Batman on the big screen, then The Dark Knight reinvented the superhero genre as a whole and solidified this series' success, imprinting itself in the memories of countless moviegoers everywhere. The Dark Knight is one of those few great films that takes its genre, reinvents it as something we'd never seen before, and subsequently sets the standard for every movie of the same genre that comes after at (until another film comes along that's just as revolutionary, if ever). Just about everything that was good about Batman Begins is here and then some, whether it's the characters, acting, storyline, special effects, action, and etc. Christian Bale is once again fantastic as a gritty and realistic Batman. The rest of returning cast (Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman) are all great as well. But what really makes the film shine is the late Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker, which is absolutely immersive and brilliantly acted to the point where Heath Ledger almost ceases to be himself and becomes the character entirely, and subsequently, is and always will be the definitive live-action Joker (Take that, Jack Nicholson). Aaron Eckhart is also great and somewhat underrated as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, transitioning perfectly from good to evil after his disfigurement, which speaks for his duality as an actor. The only real weak aspect, once again, is the female lead of Rachel Dawes. This time around however, they've recast Maggie Gyllenhaal as the character after Katie Holmes decided she wasn't coming back to the series. Now I've never been a fan of seeing recasting in a role because it just feels wrong to me, but if the replacement actor does well, I can justify and even forgive it. However, even though Katie Holmes wasn't that good as Rachel to begin with, Maggie Gyllenhaal somehow manages to be even worse; being even more bland and uninteresting than Holmes was. At least Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes was attractive enough so that I could believe Bruce Wayne would fall in love with her, but Gyllenhaal doesn't even have that going for her (I cringe every time I watch the scene where the Joker calls her beautiful). She's so bad and forgettable that I was honestly kind of glad when she gets blown up (I know, that makes me sound like a bad person but I bet you felt the same way too). And ultimately, her bad acting can't get in the way of how epic the film is. In the end, I think it's safe to say this is the best Batman movie ever, one of the best sequels ever, and even the best superhero movie ever; just a triumphant masterpiece of modern-day cinema.",

            "content": "There has never been a perfect Batman film and there probably never will be. What The Dark Night trilogy gave us though were three coherent, original, yet each distinct pieces of the Batman puzzle each with their own ups and downs.\n\nThis instalment is the most revered and in many ways that's understandable but  its not without its flaws. You'll be lucky to find any flawless film out there but its worth taking a step back from the hype with this one, not just to get the clearest picture, but also out of respect for this, quite brilliant, film.\n\nIt deserves to be harshly judged because from the opening minutes till the very final ones it demands respect and makes clear to all that it aims to be memorable. The only way to treat a film like that is to try and be critical of it because it deserves more than being great on credit alone, it deserves to prove that its great.\n\nThat was me shedding the last of my Batman-intensity for now- it comes and goes. So, as a follow up to Batman Begins it is superb- an improvement in every way aside from the fact that there's less space for it to breath because there's more expected of it and more given in the shape of a frantic plot. \n\nAs the middle instalment in the trilogy its also superb- each film offers a different stage in the process and in many ways, this middle film, is the main course. Its greatest strengths are probably its plot, cinematography and performances. Despite being heavy on content the story is always coherent and interesting- it flows well, develops and expands well and still has enough space to breath and leave something for the next instalment. \n\nThis is almost solely due to Nolan's wholly original ability to influence a script with such finesse that  dramatic and, often movie-dominating plot-twists can be incorporated with relative ease. Its a slight of hand that occurs again and again and allows for endless elements to become incorporated into one film without it ever losing its natural development.\n\nOf course, with so many successes in that field in this one film its hard not to be left wanting more and one or two elements can't help but feel crammed in at their final stages of development. Its never rough or coarse in that way but it leaves us with a selfish disappointment in that we know we've had more than enough and yet we still want just that tiny bit more. Sadly, this is an issue that carried on into the final film. \n\nThe clearest example of this is Dent's progression into villainy- it feels too contrived and begins strong before trickling down into one of the weaker sub-plots. This is through no fault of Eckhart's performance or from the character itself, as its a favourite of mine. The fault lies in the script simply not being able to deliver goods from every angle, which is entirely understandable with something as ambitious as this.\n\nDawes is also a weak area, feeling more like a token female love interest than a real part of the story with her only real role being to speed up Dent's progression as fast as possible. Again, I don't blame the performance from this- Gylenhaal's style isn't for everyone, but I think she gave a solid performance and feel that the issues lied more with her character, dialogue and general positioning within the script.\n\nThe performances as a whole were strong but I've found the trilogy to be over-cast in this film and the final instalment. The first film already had a star-studded cast and casting Katie Holmes and Cillian Murphy in it also gave it a strong middle-ground and allowed Murphy to really stand out. (I feel his performance has been overshadowed by Ledger and then Hardy but in many ways Scarecrow is equally as strong a villain) \n\nI feel that the next two films removed this middle-ground and simply replaced it with more well-known names. I understand the need to keep things fresh and I enjoyed the performances but it comes close to turning the series into a novelty, a franchise folding under commercial pressure. That's the very extreme of course but more realistically- just by having Freeman and Caine in there you've got a supporting cast that's stronger than most films' lead cast. \n\nSpeaking of the lead cast, we have two pretty dynamic performances here. Firstly, Bale continues to deliver what we've been waiting for in a Batman but I find his performance in the next instalment to be far superior, he progresses throughout each of them and he gets it spot on in the end- the voice is finally just right and the movements are more fluid while also wielding more power. Nonetheless, he delivers here and does what he needs to with, an actually quite minimal part in the film. That sounds silly but there's seriously little real dialogue in the part this time round and Wayne is a relatively simple character at this point in the series- out of the three, I feel that this is the one where Batman actually takes a step to the side, surely just because of how much is going on.\n\nLedger's performance is great and he makes The Joker his own while paying tribute to those in the role before him. He steals every scene in which he appears and its clear that that is the film's intention- this one was always going to be about The Joker. \n\nI don't believe Ledger's performance has been overrated as some have argued- I see his influences *cough* Tom *cough* Waits *cough* and I see the unique subtleties that take the performance well-beyond the call of duty- I dare say that most other actors would not have been able to make The Joker such a success had they been cast in the role. While he steals his scenes, I don't believe that he steals the film at all and that's because the other performances are powerhouses too which is no surprise considering that the likes of Oldman and Fichtnerare involved. Heck, if any performances didn't rise up, I'd have to say they were Freeman's and Caine's- they just felt completely safe in what they were doing, they weren't pushing themselves in the way that the rest of the cast did- most people are out of their comfort zone with something like this but it felt like Freeman and Caine were put right into theirs- a weakness with all three films is the achingly simple portrayals of Fox and Alfred- they receive some of the strongest dialogue in the films but they tend to feel like 'acting breaks' in-between the intense action of plot development of other scenes. Glorified motivational speakers for the most part in this one and it feels rather unnecessary especially considering how well Oldman can carry that torch himself.\n\nThe visuals of the film are great though I have a few issues that I generally seem to be the only one bothered by- with the faster action scenes some of the editing is very slightly awkwardly-paced with the timing of the camera changes sometimes being noticeably off, at least for me anyway. \n\nIn trying to create realistic fight scenes I feel that it slows down too much at times- the fighting looks and feels great but as its rarely one-on-one the surrounding characters seem too in place, waiting for their cue which kills the realism a little. One example is when Batman breaks in through a window, does a forward roll, runs to the next room, disarms a man and then takes him down. It all looks great and slick yet powerful but there's two other men, all the while pointing their guns who could at any moment shoot- they are right by the window, they could shoot him before he is on his feet and yet they literally pause until the other man has been disarmed- the scene was just too ambitious for the format and when you contrast it to other scenes where the lighting is darker and the space is more restricted (the club scene for instance) everything works perfectly. Its a strange problem as I don't recall it being an issue in the other films but I've seen this one several times now and it always feels a bit off to me.\n\nAnother issue was the use of CGI- in creating that gritty realism throughout, CGI is hardly used and that's great but it means that when it is used its very obvious and off-putting, it doesn't help that even technology from as recently as 2008 already feels outdated compared to new films. The film is overly-flashy at times too, particularly with the batbike (can I call it that?) but the vast majority of the action in this film is very well done.\n\nThe bike scenes when the driving is close up are stunning and the Batmobile/truck/SWAT scene is astounding. These along with powerful punches, (that are great without resorting to gore) generally great camera work and the sinister streets of Gotham as epic as always, makes this a real visual-treat.\n\nThere are other issues that I could point out but saying more would just be trampling over the successes, which I haven't covered in nearly as much detail- simply wouldn't have time. The fact that I've been so extensive about the issues is proof that the film is so great, its problems need to be explained well and justified so as to be fair.\n\nIts a mighty genre-transcending piece that rightly has its place as a classic and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to thrive, many, many years from now. I am generally not a super-hero movie fan and for this one to do the franchise such justice while appealing so much to me is another thing worthy of respect. Its too grand a film for me to really love- I'll always prefer something more bare and minimal but that wouldn't suit this trilogy and it wouldn't have made it the success that it has been either.\n\nBATMAN.",

            "content": "\"I think you and I are destined to do this forever.\"\r\n\r\nI love comic book films. There were the 3 Iron Man films (all of which I loved), The First Avenger, Thor. But I don't consider The Dark Knight a comic book film. 2012's The Avengers is a comic book film. It's cartoonish and action-packed. It had aliens, battlesuits, gods, other realms, and other things that aren't real. The First Avenger had a bright and shining agent of unlimited power in the shape of a cube and had us believe Steve Rogers survived getting frozen (Even if he was a superhuman, his blood and pulse would also freeze along with his physical self, therefore killing him.) Thor had the obvious theme of magic and supernatural gods. I could also add Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man to the list of comic book films above. Both Raimi's and Webb's versions had an awkward teenage boy getting bitten by a radioactive spider. What all these films had in common were they had unrealistic set pieces. As unrealistic as they were, these films were more loyal to the comics they used as a basis. The most realistic of the movies above were, in my opinion, Iron Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man. Iron Man 3, instead of displaying the Mandarin to be an old man with magic rings as his weapon, showed him to be a terrorist leader. The Amazing Spider-Man became more loyal to the comic and at the same time became more realistic by, instead of Peter's spider web coming from his wrist, showing that Peter's spider web came from a wrist device that Peter invented. Then again, Iron Man 3 had the fiery superhuman bit while The Amazing Spider-Man had a man turn into a mutated, hulking lizard-man. Now, I'm not saying I didn't like all those films. I loved every single one of the films mentioned above except Spider-Man 3 (which I would downgrade to \"kinda liked\"). I just think that these films are inferior to The Dark Knight. I don't consider The Dark Knight as a comic book film. In fact, to any critic's review, positive or negative, that says that The Dark Knight is a comic book film is a review I'd have to agree to disagree with. I even disagree with the critics consensus with that one bit where it says this movie succeeds as a comic book movie. It doesn't. This film makes Daredevil, Elektra, and The Fantastic Four look like Superman (1978), The Rocketeer, and The Mask of the Phantasm in comparison if you're talking about how great this film is as a comic book movie. In the Batman comics, Batman goes against monsters and magic. This film isn't loyal. It changes how the Joker and Two-Face became who they were, it continues to choose a completely fictional character (Rachel Dawes) to be a main character, and most of all, Bruce Wayne does a Sam Elliott impression every time he dons his costume. No, this film isn't a comic book film. It's a superhero film. It uses comic book characters, but it's not about comics. It's about heroes.\r\n\r\nHere is The Dark Knight's best film set pieces in order:\r\n\r\n1. Story\r\n2. Characters/Performances\r\n3. Script\r\n\r\nLet's talk about the script. The Dark Knight follows The Big Lebowski as the most quotable movie of all time. The script was brilliant and it created a very serious and ghoulishly brooding overtone for the film. Serious and brooding overtones aren't necessarily good. Just look at Daredevil. But it made The Dark Knight different from older versions of Batman. It separated Christian Bale from Adam West, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney. It separated Aaron Eckhart from Tommy Lee Jones (who is still really, really awesome by the way). It separated Maggie Gyllenhaal from Kim Basinger. It separated Heath Ledger from Cesar Romero. This overtone made the Joker gleeful and terrifyingly villainous in a way that was more powerful than Jack Nicholson's Joker (But I think both Ledger's and Nicholson's versions were equally great in their own ways. And Jack Nicholson is still really, really awesome). Now let's talk about the characters. I've met some people who thought Heath Ledger's performance was only universally acclaimed out of respect for the dead. Which in this case, was unfortunately Mr. Ledger himself. RIP, by the way. But in my opinion, Ledger's suspense-inducing and horrifying portrayal of the Clown Prince of Crime is up there on the Greatest Film Characters Hall of Fame along with The Dude, Walter Sobchak, Travis Bickle, Ed Wood, Gerry Boyle, Agent K, and many others. The rest of the cast was also spectacular. Christian Bale brought depth into the character of Batman in a way even the other good Batman (Michael Keaton) never could. Aaron Eckhart was a really great villain, and he makes the viewer feel sad that Harvey Dent became a bad guy because he could've been a much greater hero. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are amazing as usual. The characters are a very big part of a film. Films with great characters like The Big Lebowski and Magnolia are enough to make them both marvelous, entertaining, and unforgettable. Similarly, the characters of The Dark Knight are one of the major reasons this film is phenomenal. Finally, there's the story. I will tell you of a film that had great visual effects and a great performance from its main star. That film was Oblivion. The positive things RT counted from Oblivion was the special effects and the performance of Tom Cruise. But what critics didn't find present in it was a good story, which was most likely what led to its rotten rating that's ever so close to a fresh one. The story of The Dark Knight took genuine storytelling and actual elements from the comics and put them into one book. For example, the comic The Killing Joke exchanged between two story lines: Batman trying to save Commissioner Gordon from the Joker's new bad guy plan, and the backstory of the evil yet mysterious clown prince of crime, the Joker. The Dark Knight's story was more similar to the former. The Joker's current plan for Commissioner Gordon was to put him through a day of true Hell. Joker captures the Commissioner's daughter, Barbara Gordon (AKA Batgirl), and shoots her through the spine, crippling her. In my opinion, that has to be Comic Book Joker's most villainous deed since he beat Jason Todd with a crowbar and blowing him up with his biological mother. Anyway, Joker's plan in The Killing Joke was to show Batman that anyone, even the sanest person on the planet, can turn into a lunatic through a day of pain and torture. In order to show Batman that, he cripples Batgirl (also turning her into her other heroine persona, Oracle), strips her naked, takes pictures of her bloodied and exposed body, captures Gordon, strips him naked (I don't know what's up with that), and sends Gordon through a roller coaster of Hell. During the ride, he is surrounded by pictures of his daughter's bloodied body all the while getting laughed at by the Joker's creepy henchmen and being subjected to the forced listening to Joker's impromptu jingle about insanity. The Joker expects Gordon to be insane at the end of the ride, but the bad guys never win. Similarly, the Joker does this to Harvey Dent by getting him captured, having half of his face burned off, and killing his fianc\u00e9e (who had just accepted his proposal). Although unlike Commissioner Gordon in The Killing Joke comic, Harvey's sanity gave in, and soon turns into another infamous Batman antagonist, Two-Face. While some people might find that too bleak, I find it to be another realistic element added by Christopher Nolan because it shows that not everything ends with a happy ending. Which of course this film certainly did not. Anyway, this film is my exact example of a perfect film. If my scoring system was similar to IMDB and I can use decimals, I would still give this film an exact 10/10. No, not a 9.7/10. Not a 9.8/10. Not even a 9.9/10. My score would be 10/10, no matter what. In other Batman media, such as the animated Batman TV shows, if you see a flaw in the realism of it all (such as Batman knowing exactly where the villain's secret lair is or how he can move so quickly from one place to another), one can easily respond, \"BECAUSE HE'S BATMAN!!!!\". With Mr. Nolan's version, you couldn't do that because in the Nolanverse, Batman wasn't using teleporting machines or rocket boots. He had military technology, but compared to everything he's used in other media, the weapons he used in the Nolanverse were nothing. He also didn't have his supernatural and extraterrestrial friends like Superman or Green Lantern. If an ultra powerful force were to attack Gotham, he wouldn't have help from them. If he dies, he can't be resurrected. It's like with James Bond and Die Hard. What Daniel Craig's Bond did was that it modernized one of the oldest characters and excellently settle in James Bond into a modern world where there aren't any exploding pens or invisible cars. Daniel Craig modernized Bond, like what Nolan did to Batman. The first Die Hard was loved by people not only because it was an action-packed and witty film, but also because John McClane was an everyman. An ordinary joe. Besides that, he was trapped in a building full of terrorists and hostages, meaning the police couldn't just bust in anytime and help John. He had to save everyone by himself. Also why some people didn't like the fourth one and why most people didn't like the fifth one. At that point, John was a Jason Bourne. He seemed like a superhuman who could survive anything and lived in a world where anytime, he can just call people for help to defeat the bad guy. Like Die Hard, in the Justice League or the Brave and the Bold animated series, Batman paired up with Superman, Green Lantern, the Atom, Green Arrow, Plastic Man, and many others. In the Nolanverse, sure, he had Lucius Fox's machines, he had help from Gordon, and he had help from Catwoman and the rest of the GCPD in TDKR. But like Batman's weapons, compared to Batman's other superhero partners, Fox, Gordon, Selina, and the police force were nothing. So overall, Christopher Nolan made Batman's life much more difficult. But still, The Dark Knight is a masterful and well-crafted spectacle for both Batman fans and non-fans, and words cannot describe, in my opinion, how true the words, \"The Dark Knight is the greatest film of all time.\" really are. Well, all I know for sure, it's true enough to make this amazing film my one and only absolute favorite.",

I love the movie, but the best performance in The Dark Knight was the late great Heath Ledger as one of Batman's arch-nemesis The Joker. Playing The Joker was really hard when it comes to Oscar-winning stars, but if Heath was still alive right now, I should tell him: \"kid, you are amazing. That's what movies are meant to be made. God Bless You, Mr. Ledger. Encore! Encore!\" Now that the series is over, what's next for Batman and what actor should replace Christian Bale and come up with a new and exciting idea to help the Batman fans which graphic novel from his collection will be next? Bar none, I think The Dark Knight is definitely one of the more definitive stories in pop culture that we still talked about for years to come. R.I.P. Heath Ledger.",

Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker was solid gold, potentially his best performance yet (i think he should get the oscar for it), it was so good that i forgot he was Heath Ledger and thought of him only as the Joker. i found myself losing interest in the other characters (don't get me wrong, i didn't lose all interest in them. infact i was quite intrigued with Harvey Dent/Two Face and how Batman/Bruce Wayne viewed him as Gotham's white Knight and true hero) and focused mainly on the Joker. i was rather annoyed to find that they had changed the actress for Rachel Dawes, the new one didn't fit properly, and i caught myself before i started thinking that it might have been a good thing that they had killed her off. instead, i gave her credit for at least trying.\r\nanyway, my overall review is this - MOST AMAZING MOVIE EVER!!! <3",

            "content": "Just as the supreme surprise that was 'Batman Begins' is about to close, Jim Gordon gives Batman information about a guy: \"Take this guy. Armed robbery, double homicide. He got a taste for the theatrical like you. Leaves a calling card.\" Batman turns the playing card over, sealed in an plastic evidence bag, to reveal a Joker card. It was probably the greatest tease in any comic-book movie and previews what is to come. But it doesn't prepare fans for the sheer experience that would soon be 'The Dark Knight'. Countless words were used to gush about it and here are a few: Legendary blockbuster cinema. This was arguably the greatest superhero film of all time and I can't disagree with that. It takes 'Batman Begins' and takes it a whole new level! It delivers everything you'd hope for in terms of action, then delivers on a whole other level as well. Deep down, the film tackles the very essence of not just superhero movies but any essential dramatic feature; a psychological dissection of the nature of Good and Evil, and the perilously fine line that often separates the two. And it encapsulates all this in an crime saga that's richly-layered, intelligent, and uncompromising. \n\nMuch of 'The Dark Knight' immense success can be pinpoint to one standout achievement: Heath Ledger's Joker. Fans were skeptical but were ultimately blown away by Ledger's completely transcending performance. It is the greatest villainous performance because it elevates everything around it in the movie. The character after all is the most dangerous and dastardly villain to bring chaos to Gotham City to begin with. From the subtle mannerisms like the twitch of his eyes, the quick lick of his lips, the hunched shoulders to the eerie voice and dread inducing dialogue, Ledger's performance is arguably THE crowning achievement of any superhero movie. Jack Nicolson gave a great performance of the same character in 1989's 'Batman' but like all the other Batman villains before 'Batman Begins', he comes off as a hyper violent cartoon character. Ledger gives us a scarier, grounded, and definitive Joker in which he delivers the true essence of the character. He is not a rational gangster or greedy mustache twister with a lot of motive; he is a straight-up psychopath who kills & induces fear because he \"just wants to watch the world burn\". The infamous bank heist prologue in the very beginning establishes the character perfectly in itself (\"I believe that whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...stranger.) but that's not all. Most all his scenes mesmerizes, like where the Joker describes how he got the scars on his face, you realize that each story might be a lie. The mystique of the character elevates his menace with razor-sharp tension and unpredictability permutating the film. May Heath Ledger rest in peace because his acting career had only begun!\n\n\nPutting aside the Joker, the rest of the film still excels on many other levels and surpasses its predecessor. Between the two films, a year has past and Batman seems to have reached his prime rather quickly; a symbol of fear for those who pray on the fearful. But throwing Joker into the mix, Bruce Wayne is faced with a new set of compelling challenges that will shake him to his core. Bale's performance is terrifically understated, often overshadowed by Heath Ledger but no less worthy. That interrogation scene between Batman & the Joker...pure cinema! Much of the Joker's crimes puts quite a psychological toll on Batman and the people of Gotham but none are more impactful than on District Attorney Harvey Dent. This is where the movie gets its most emotional arc. Dent proves to be a really good man, a bright light of hope in Gotham who will put everything on the line to get justice; a man that Bruce is inspired by his dedication and earnest idealism, even as that same man wins the heart of his love interest in Rachel. Aaron Eckhart gives a strong, spirited & ultimately tragic performance that makes the ending all the more earth-shattering. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a good replacement of Katie Holmes as Rachel. She seems tougher, more lively and more in sync with the fellow actors. I cared for her much more and I was shook when she is killed off. Her death breaks Harvey which makes him susceptible to the Joker's twisted philosophy (\"You know the thing about chaos? It's fair.\"). The rest of the cast, including Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, are outstanding. But if there was one performance that I wasn't quite impressed by is the Italian Mob guy, Chechen (Ritchie Coster), mainly because I found his accent horrendous.\n\nIf there is one thing that standouts about the film is that every set-piece feel like one show-stopping climax after another. It can be exhausting but also exhilarating to watch it all pieced together, thanks to Nolan's brilliant screenplay, Wally Pfister's masterful cinematography and Lee Smith's taut film editing. For a 2.5 hour film, 'The Dark Knight' flies by and never drags! Some might be boggled the movie's hyper-active structure but it really makes the twists in the story positively volatile and nail-biting to the end. Again, some moments of the pulse-pounding action sequences are a tad incoherent, but its not an issue as its probably moments that are representative of the Joker's state of his chaotic mind; which is also represented in Hans Zimmer/James Newton Howard's electric music score. CGI effects is minimal but rendered to perfection. Harvey Dent's burnt half of his face is all CGI and it looks so damn realistic and gnarly. The sets are quite epic too; They built an entire hospital (outside shell) to blow up. The gadgets are better than ever and Batman's suit gets a clever upgrade. I could really go on forever about 'The Dark Knight.' It is dark, complex and unforgettable. As Batman realizes he must live on to become the villain so that Harvey Dent's legacy can heal the scorned city of Gotham. Expectations were incredible high for the next film and I doubt that there will be any superhero movie to surpass for decades to come.- 10/10 (A+)",

I have always wondered if a bad guy would ever step up and challenge the question \"Can a bad guy actually win?\" We always have a that feeling like the good guy will always pull out a victory. Joker gives you a shiver up your spine and kind of makes you question whether he can be defeated. He has no motive, no agenda, or plan. He just wants to watch the world burn. Ledger truly takes his performance to a new level and raised the bar for movie bad guys everywhere. The guy that no one ever talks about in this movie is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. If the Ledger got the MVP in this film then Eckhart got  a very close runner-up award. He is the under-rated actor in this film. Overall this film in my opinion is one of the best films of our generation.   10/10",

            "content": "The Dark Knight\n\tI began watching Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight last night and thought that this was the best version of the Batman movies I had ever seen. The reasons I might think Christopher Nolan's Batman movies are the best ones I have seen are probably because of: the actors/actresses, technology, and story. \n\tIn The Dark Knight, there are a few new characters/villains added to the story. These new characters are the District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), The Joker (Heath Ledger), and Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart). Although Batman is the main character, the movie does focus a lot on the Joker and the chaos and destruction he causes, which is a vital part of the movie, because without the Joker's mischief being shown the movie would be pretty boring. \n\tIn this movie we don't only see the Batmobile (also known as the Tumbler) again, but we see something new, the Batpod. The Batpod, was used after the Tumbler took some major damage. It was incredibly cool and one of the most badass motorcycles I have ever seen. It has dual front mounted cannons, machine guns, and grappling hooks. Apart from the new vehicle Batman got, he also received new armor that allowed for better flexibility and mobility. This helps for a few reasons and the most important one being that he can actually turn his head like he would without the suit and not have to turn his entire body if he wants to see something next to him or behind him.\n\tBesides the new characters/villains in the movie that we are introduced to we have characters from the last Christopher Nolan Batman movie, Batman Begins. We have Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), Alfred (Michael Caine), and Captain/Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), and most importantly Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale). These characters help make the movie what it is, the movie is absolutely amazing.\n\tI personally think Christian Bale's performance in this movie was pretty good, but the performance of Heath Ledgers was better. I even think that Heath Ledger's Joker was better than Jack Nicholson's Joker. They portray two different types of Joker, but Ledger just blew me away with his performance. I know in previews of movies they will claim so and so gave the best performance of their career, which is bullshit most of the time, but this was his best performance in his entire career.\n\tAll in all I think the movie was amazing. The action, story, and humor really shined in this movie. Nolan is doing a phenomenal job with creating the new Batman movies. I can't wait to watch The Dark Knight Rises next.",

            "content": "'The Dark Knight' is one of the year's best films. And it's the best superhero film of all time. Although, it's more closely related to crime-drama than superhero. Never have we seen a psychological masterpiece as haunting and deeply disturbing as this one. The story is simple: Batman (Christian Bale) must battle the ruthlessly evil Joker (Heath Ledger in an Oscar worthy performance). With that set up, director Chris Nolan moves this movie into thematic territory never before seen in a superhero movie. The Joker is so evil and so psychotic that he needs no motive to do the things he does. At one point he tells Batman, \"You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self righteousness, and I won't kill you because, you're just too much fun.\" At another point in the film, he makes the mob share half their money with him, and then he burns it in front of them. The film is filmed with dramatically confounding scenes like this that leave your jaw dropped to the floor, unable to move. The unnerving sense of satanic evil exuding from this character is so frightening, it rivals the greatest screen villains in history. In fact, Ledger's Joker may be the greatest villian ever to be put on the screen. Licking his lips at the excitement of causing psychological dilemmas and ultimatums for his victims, his make up smeared, he never fails to make our insides churn with disgust. If he isn't nominated this coming year, I'll be shocked, as I will if the film isn't nominated for Best Picture. Because it is. So far anyways. Neck and neck with Wall*E. The Joker isn't the only enemy in the film, and here's the film only flaw: Two face. The character can never be completely plausible. He works much better here than he ever has before, (avoid seeing Tommy Lee Jones in a horrible portrayal of Harvey Dent/Two Face in 'Batman Forever'), but he wasn't written as genuinely or as intrigueingly as the Joker was. However, his scene at the end of the film is intensely frightening, and the dark beauty of is motivs is somewhat gratifying. The Dark Knight works on every other level. The writing, the cinematography, the editing, the music, the acting, everything. Maggie Gyllenhaal is great as Rachel Dawes, and Morgan Freeman, along with Michael Cain and Christian Bale give A performances. Director Christopher Nolan has made a masterpiece. A film that transends genres, that doesn't take cheap shortcuts are gimmicks, a film that genuinely wants us to suffer along with the victims of the Joker's horrible deeds, and that suffering is both heartbreaking and extremely satisfying. The Must See Film of 2008 is The Dark Knight.",

Through the amazing production design, costuming, makeup and score, The Dark Knight is complex enough to stand alone without the other films in the trilogy. Build on darkness and an epic thrill factor, it shows the real desperate needs of society in such an interesting way. Heath Ledger as the Joker will go down as the greatest show of acting ever. Immersive, gripping and intense, Ledger has used every single ounce of the character development to craft a villain so hateable and so chaotic and mad, that he feel real and layered. The Dark Knight is on its own level. It doesn't rely on trying to get past certain checkpoints to be a good movie. It just gets there with style and brilliance.",

I think that Nolan did this deliberately to change the spectator's monotone way of thinking. I guess he changed the concept of Movies by combining an entertainment movie to self-reacting and attractive movie. And after all it's a point of view, but why not give it another re-watch ? But Its not only about the gripping plot that this movie has succeeded,its also because of the great morality that lies inside, from a maniac we learn something as for a law hero that his changes will leave us thinking, however who won, who lost. who's right and who's wrong. This movie will remain one of most thrilling movies of all time, and thumps up again for Nolan and his crew !",

He gave a perfect performance and his line 'Maybe we're destined to fight forever.' shows that the Joker will always fight against Batman.  Both he and Jack Nicholoson were amazing in their own ways, and I do not believe that the two should be compared.  Morgan Freeman was legendary as usual and I was glad he was given a larger role in this film.  Maggie Gyllenhaal has received some tough critisism but I prefered her to Katie Holmes.

            "content": "Show me a better movie and I'll show you a purple dinosaur that can handle a sniper rifle. WOW. This is an incredible movie. It's dark, thematic, complex, action packed and emotionally stimulating in that order. Batman Begins was about expounding and developing upon Batman's character, The Dark Knight is about doing the same for the Joker's character. To a child watching the movie, the Joker is the epitome of pure insanity, but anyone who really understands the movie and what Christopher Nolan is trying to convey understands that what makes the joker truly frightening is that he's actually very smart and has some plausible ideas about humanity. The main thing he wants to prove is that everyone is corruptible and the presence of random injustice means there is no \"justice.\" The interesting thing to me is that both the joker and Batman experienced traumatic events in their childhood: the joker had an abusive father and probably dealt with other horrible things, batman watched his parents die in front of him as an eight year old. Yet, these two could not be any more different-they are, in fact, complete opposites. The joker represents chaos and the Darwinian idea of Survival of the Fittest, meaning that he thinks there should be no rules since humans are by nature selfish and incapable of truly following rules designed to promote compassion. Batman, on the other hand, has a tremendous amount of faith in people and their ability to love and be selfless for the good of the human race. One could argue that even being \" selfless\" is selfish because it brings a satisfying feeling to the person who performed the compassionate act. However, in my opinion, the fact that it may be selfish to be selfless doesn't detract from the value that doing something for another person carries. This a paradox of humanity: by helping others you're really helping yourself. One of the reasons I love Bruce Wayne is because when he experienced tragedy he decided to dedicate his life to trying to protect others from tragedy, which is an incredibly admirable thing to do. The joker, on the other hand, said \" well, my life sucks so I'm going to show everyone how bad people really are deep down\" which is not an admirable thing to do... but anyone with an open mind must admit that the joker presents truths about the nature of people. He was able to corrupt Gotham's \" white knight\" in Harvey Dent and hence won the battle against batman by showing him that even the most honorable person is capable of evil. However, there are things in this movie that show the power of human compassion. For example, when the prisoner throws the detonator to the bomb ( which will kill the good people of Gotham and save his boat from being blown up) out the window the power of good defeats the forces of human greed. This was an incredibly powerful scene that made my jaw drop. The reason this movie is so much better than The Avengers is because The Avengers is just a mindless movie about beating up aliens. This movie presents ideas about humanity and makes the audience wonder \" if I were in that position... what would I do?\" This is a thoughtful movie for thoughtful people.",

Did he burn to death on the money pile? Where did the jokers get the russian's dogs? Did he kill the russians, or did the russians join his team? Good directors don't leave us with questions. I'm assuming that since Nolan is a good director, and I still had questions that it was about cutting for time (this movie was too long) and that the director's cut DVD will answer my questions.\n\nI think that the individual performances saved the film. Heath Ledger was great. Oscar worthy? I'm unsure. But it was clear that the guy developed a real detailed character. For those of you who care to compare: His work in Brokeback was all about developing a voice and how he kept his mouth closed and that closure, even when he was speaking, lent him a very closed off feeling...appropriate for the role. Here, as the joker, his work was clearly again about the voice and vocal mechanics he employed. Too bad he didn't help Christian Bale who has that incredibly stupid ass whisper growl. Lame. Aaron Eckhart was underutilized and I wish we could have him for another movie or two, that'd be cool.

Como he dicho antes, Nolan ha sido capaz de dignificar el genero de los superheroes con esta trilogia que incluyendo grandes actuaciones (Oldman y Caine principalmente), ha sabido encantar con su trama. Con el tiempo la trilogia de Nolan sera una verdadera leyenda principalmente por ello, no venderse exclusivamente a lo  comercia para obtener todo el reconocimiento de los expertos. Los resultados economicos estan a la vista, siendo una de las entregas que mas ingresos ha generado en la historia. La conjuncion de Newton Howard con Zimmer en la banda sonora es extraordinaria. 100% recomendable.",

The caped crusader continues his war on crime within Gotham City alongside commissioner Gordon, with the new lawman, Harvey Dent, introducing new methods to help catch and convict the crooks. Their joint efforts succeed in most of the city's seedy underbelly, although the rise of a new sinister villain, the Joker, puts the trio to the test when he threatens to force Gotham into anarchy. Brooding characters and visuals are effective in upping the ante for both Batman and the city, and story offers up a new and darker rendition of the Joker than the one previously seen in the 1989 Batman. The director also utilizes a larger scope for this one than in the previous installment, Batman Begins, enabling us to see bigger consequences for the character's actions and the moral choices that cause them.",

I was absolutely gobsmacked!\n\nSPOILER ALERT\nThe story goes deeper and darker, and had a lot of twists and turns that I did not see coming! Clever idea coming from Christopher Nolan!\n\nWe welcome back some of the original cast from the first movie; Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman! Sadly, no Katie Holmes... However, we do have a great new cast! Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, and Maggie Gyllenhaal!\n\nHeath Ledger absolutely nailed it as The Joker! He was so unpredictable, you just couldn't look away from him. He was really scary with all that make-up on, and had some black comedy coming out of him, too. He sure has topped Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero, I mean no disrespect to the two fine actors. He deserved to win the Oscar. However, it's sad to know that what he did was terrific was his last thing he ever did, and that he wasn't able to meet his fans or join his co-stars and crew at the premiere. R.I.P Heath Ledger.\n\nAaron Eckhart was brilliant as Two-Face/Harvey Dent! Better than Tommy Lee Jones' performance in \"Batman Forever\", I mean no disrespect to the fine actor. Just that his Two-Face was a bit too Joker like in that movie, where Eckhart's Two-Face in this movie is how he is in the comics; a serious cold-blooded killer. Also, we get to see how Harvey Dent becomes Two-Face.\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal takes over Katie Holmes' character Rachel. Don't get me wrong, she is a good actress. But I preferred Katie Holmes' performance as she was more convincing to me. But it's no big deal, this movie is still good by the end of the day!\n\nAs for the locations, we still have Chicago as Gotham City, Bedfordshire, and London, with a new location; China, where Batman captures Chinese bad guy Lau!\n\nAn epic second chapter to \"The Dark Knight Trilogy\"!",

            "content": "A madman has brought his wrath to \"Gotham City\" (Chicago, Illinois) which is finally cleaning out the criminal element. That man is known to authorities as \"The Joker\" (Heath Ledger). And there is only one man who can stop him -- a masked vigilante known as \"The Batman\" (Christian Bale).\r\n\r\nHowever, another man is trying to do, legally, what the \"Caped Crusader\" has been doing. That man is the District Attorney \"Harvey Dent\" (Aaron Eckhart), who eventually becomes what \"Bruce Wayne\" (Bale) fights to become in his dark alter-ego.\r\n\r\nThe two men who are trying to get \"The Clown Prince of Crime\" each have the same partner -- \"Lt. James Gordon\" (Gary Oldman), who is one of the only uncorrupt cops on the force. But, \"Batman\" has two more partners in his battle against evil -- \"Alfred\" (Sir Michael Caine), the \"Wayne\" family butler and \"Bruce's\" life-long confidant. \"Batman's\" other partner is the CEO of \"Wayne Enterprises\", \"Lucius Fox\" (Morgan Freeman), who is the man behind all of \"Batman's\" weaponry.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let me say that this movie is, in my opinion, as close to perfect as you can come. Especially compared to movies I've seen recently. There are way more pros than cons if you ask me.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, most of the movie is just a little too bright for the world of \"Batman.\" The scenes set during sunlight were just not dark enough to set the right mood for this world originally created in DC Comics. Personally, I would have liked to have seen dimmer lighting in many day scenes where the lighting could be controlled.\r\n\r\nLike in the last film, I really had a problem with the \"Batmobile.\" It looked more like a military vehicle, and not something \"Batman\" should be behind the wheel of. Yes, it's painted black, but every version of the famed vehicle always reminded you of a bat in some way.\r\n\r\nI also had a problem with how some of the characters were used. First of all, this movie, like all in the genre, expects the audience to know the background of the main characters for the most part. I still have a problem with Caine, an Academy Award winner, as \"Alfred.\" I just can't picture him as a butler, and he was barely used in this film. Personally, I wish he and Morgan were in the film a little bit more -- especially Caine since Morgan was in the film a bit more often.\r\n\r\nDespite the weak writing of the characters, I found the performances pretty strong. Heath Ledger, who died shortly after filming this movie, is almost perfect as \"Joker\". He captures the insane tone of the character very well, and completely brings you into the performance. Bale is really good as \"Batman,\" although I thought his voice for the character was a bit much. He really did a good job as \"Wayne\" though.\r\n\r\nCaine and Morgan, though under used in my opinion, did a great job with what they were given. You really felt that \"Fox\" knew why \"Wayne\" wanted the equipment, but knew not to ask. I also thought Caine made \"Alfred\" more a father-figure than a butler. In fact, I can't even remember one time when he acted more like a butler.\r\n\r\nI was almost impressed with Eckhart until he became his evil alter-ego, \"Two-Face.\" It wasn't until his change that he really picked up his performance.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, Maggie Gyllenhaal had no chance at making \"Rachel Dawes\" her own. She had to fill the role created by Katie Holmes in \"Batman Begins\", and really didn't do anything that made you forget Holmes in the first movie. In fact, she just didn't make me feel for her when she met her fate in the film that was used as part of \"Dent's\" dive into madness. They tried to make her look like Holmes, but only made her look like a younger sister to her.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is a lot of action in this film. These scenes are fast-paced, and done perfectly. These scenes are edited very well, and get the job done. Another special effect which stands out is the \"Two-Face\" make-up, which is actually CGI edited over Eckhart's face in post-production. It wasn't until I saw some production stills online that I thought it was some very elaborate makeup.\r\n\r\nThe music was done really well in this movie. Although I couldn't tell you any pieces of music used if I heard it again, the music really enhanced scenes. Like the soundtrack should, the music was used perfectly.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't put this in the top five of your \"Must See\" list, but I would suggest that you check this one out the next time you find it on HBO, or even the next time you visit your local rental store or Netflix.",

It is well known that I was not a huge fan of Batman Begins but every problem I had with the original no longer exists. Bruce Wayne was a much better character, Rachel Dawes was portrayed perfectly, Harvey Dent added a new twist, Alfred was inspirational and lovable, Gordon found his comfort zone, and Heath Ledger portrayed the best Joker the world has ever seen, god rest his soul. This movie was Christopher Nolan's masterpiece and is a movie I can watch again and again.  \n\tThe Joker. That is really all I need to say to make this movie what it is. Without the joker, this movie is nothing. The opening scene we see the madman at his finest. We see how all he cares about is chaos and how he really has little to no motive towards anything. The physical and psychological attacks on Gotham keep the audience wanting more. We never get a background story on the joker, which is annoying, but perfect. We are supposed to know nothing about this man. He has no fingerprints, no ID, no home, nothing. He is a rogue madman who likes to bring out the worst in people and he is right. My favorite scene is when he is being interrogated by Batman and he talks about chaos theory and how people will turn on each other. And he is right and we see his plan come together in the third movie. Heath Ledger prepared well for this role, a little too well as it cost him his life, but he left behind one of the best performances I have ever seen in any movie, ever. It's up there. If there was ever a role to go out on.\n\tThis movie basically picks up shortly after Batman Begins left off. Batman is still fighting the mob and crime but Gotham also had Harvey Dent. Dent is the \"White Knight\" and he does wonder for Gotham. \"You rather die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" He says this early on in the film and that foreshadows him becoming Two-Face. It shows more brilliance on the part of The Joker. He took Gotham's hero and turned him into a villain, just to prove his point. Harvey's story is really kind of tragic but was also so powerful and caused conflict.\n\tRachel and Bruce had their one moment at the end of Batman Begins, but she has since been in a relationship with Dent. But, she told Bruce she would be there when there he didn't need Batman anymore. This has strong inner conflict with herself. She loves Bruce, but she also loves Harvey. Her character was so much more developed and she had such a strong impact on Bruce, Dent, and even Gotham. She found her place in this trilogy. She is a stronger character and Maggie Gyllenhaal did a lot better than I expected.\n\tMore characters were simply more relevant in this movie. Gary Oldman kills it as Gordon and Alfred just steals the show in every scene he is in. He has a way of explaining the world to Bruce that just makes sense. \"Some men just want to watch the world burn.\" Alfred just gets what is going on and understands what is going on in Gotham. Gordon tries to understand but he is too much of a cop and tries to find motive behind the Joker. That is what I think is his weakness. He tries to think like the Joker, but he can't. He wants to be one step ahead but it's impossible. Alfred understands that one cannot try and understand the Joker to defeat him. It's genius really and there are little subtleties like that in which make this move what it is.\n\tIs this movie perfect? No, far from it. The ending to this movie is highly flawed with characters not getting proper endings. Granted nobody expected Heath Ledger to kick the bucket and one could argue that Harvey Dent got screwed. Let's be honest, the ending wasn't great but it was how it had to end. I may not have enjoyed all parts but given the circumstances and assuming Christopher Nolan wanted the Joker in the third movie, the ending worked. Gary Oldman saves it with the monologue he gives before it cuts to credits. The man just speaks the truth in that monologue. Other characters, like the lawyer who tied to blackmail Wayne was never heard from again, one of the mobsters was questioned to be alive. Just little things diehard fans can nitpick at. I'm not sure how accurate these movies are to comic books, but who cares.\n\tOverall, The Dark Knight was a summer blockbuster that deserved every cent it made. Honestly, I think Christopher Nolan deserved an Oscar nomination, but that's just me. I know a lot of people agree with that but the Academy is weird like that. Hans Zimmer returns and nails it with the music once again. Music makes the movie, I say it again and again and that is a big reason why The Dark Knight gets the WillyT Seal of Approval. Go and see this movie and enjoy. It has an effect on your mind as well as incredibly entertaining. It's movie like this that inspire people to want to make movies and join the experience. So see this movie, get inspired, make a movie, and get approved.",

            "content": "For what seems like all of Batman's history with Hollywood, even with Nolan's previous effort in the Batman Reboots--Batman Begins--the original caped crusader has been forcefully cast \"into the light\". He wasn't the dark, brooding, human being that became his signature in the comic books. With Tim Burton's \"Batman\" and \"Batman Returns\" there were dark elements to the story, but the dark themes were never as all-encompasing as they should have been with the character himself. In a way, Batman in Hollywood had grown a false stigma of being very one-dimensional. Things certainly weren't helped when the atrocious \"Batman Forever\" hit theatres (let's pretend that \"Batman & Robin\" never happened, and spare Schumacher  the shame).\n\nEnter Christopher Nolan. Fresh off \"The Prestige\" and \"Batman Begins\", he's already proven his adept ability to take a simple story and wrap it around your mind, involving you mentally and emotionally into his movies. With his brother Jonathan Nolan and himself as the primary writers--not having David S. Goyer to weigh them down--they've finally succeeded in bringing the character of Bruce Wayne to the screen with intimacy, intensity, and darkness.\n\nWith Gotham finally recovered from the failed attack Ra's al Ghul and his League of Shadows, Batman has reached the absolute height of his power. The mean streets of Gotham are beginning to run cleanly again, and Batman's fight seems to be coming to an end. With the Gotham Police Department helping him track down the last remaining mod's assets, Bruce Wayne is having more issues with amateurs following his example than tracking down the criminals themselves.\n\nBut Batman's plans continue to put the mob in tight places, cutting of their escapes one by one. Clinging to the last of their blood-money with desperate hands, they've run out of options. In their haste to keep their power in place they finally decide turn to help. That help is a single man. A man with green hair and crude makeup, who is as insane as he is intelligent. The absolute worst kind of criminal. The Joker.\n\nAnd so it begins.\n\nThe beauty that Nolan has drawn to the Batman saga isn't just about a human being that has evolved to become the perfect hunter. He has become a vigilante, in every sense of the word. Being hunted by both parties, good and evil, has caused him to rise to a neutral status: he does what he does for the sake of all. He is not the judge, jury, or executioner, and refuses to be such. And the Joker, manically insane and so perfectly performed by the late Heath Ledger, is his polar opposite: doing evil for evil sake, and finding entertainment in the sadistic, darkly comical every day plans he makes. Fighting such an enemy is more than a challenge to Bruce Wayne, who not only fights as Batman but fights as himself as well. He no longer wants the life of a vigilante. He wants to retire, fall in love, and live life. Defeating the Joker is his final trial. The last push to cleanse Gotham--and retire the Batman--for good.\n\nChristopher Nolan makes pulls no punches in constructing Bruce Wayne's fight, taking the story of the Batman and turning him into the legend that Gotham needs. With the Joker hot on his tail, literally burning buildings down in order to match him on the battlefield, Batman must push the very limits of being Gotham's guardian. And choosing what matters to Bruce Wayne, the Batman, and the city, will change the identity of Batman forever.",

            "content": "Christopher Nolan?s 2008 film sequel The Dark Knight is a sick and twisted tale of the battle between a broken Batman and a depraved killer, The Joker. The movie is quite disturbing in the exploration of the mind of the murderer and his affect on the general public. Nolan brilliantly builds endless suspense with a fast paced plot and complex characters. The interest sparked in the audience is caused by the performance of The Joker by Heath Ledger. His complete disregard for society?s morals and his constant ability to force people to make horribly gut-wrenching decisions makes the audience uncomfortable and worried about the destruction he will cause Gotham City. Even the way he speaks in a calm, all-knowing manner is too strange for such a horrid being. Peter Rainer of the Christian Science Monitor further gives insight into The Joker, ?Ledger doesn't offer the audience the slightest glimmer of hope or hilarity. His motto is a sick-joke variant on Nietzsche: \"Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stranger.\" Nietzsche had it as \"stronger,\" and that applies to the Joker as well: He's fortified by awfulness.? This awfulness behind the Joker is what pushes the film forward in such an intriguing way. The Joker?s strange mind is a driving force in Batman?s internal battles that also keep the viewer guessing. The film is a troubling look into the chaos that will ensue if a major city was ever attacked by such a ruthless villain. The extremes of human nature are symbolized in the sadistic acts of the Joker and the hope trying to be spread to keep the people safe. http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Movies/2008/0719/p25s04-almo.html  \n\nBeing an avid fan of Nolan?s take on the Batman comics makes my opinions are slightly biased. As much as I love taking on a debate about a complex movie, there are some things that you can?t really argue. Things like whether or not all elements of the Batman movies are realistic. Adam Nayman of Reverse Shot made comments in his review of The Dark Knight about how many of the scenes are improbable. At the beginning of his article Nayman states, ?the general tone of the film, which is heavy on psychologizing but light on actual plausible psychology.? Although I?m not a true psychologist, I know enough to believe that a lot of the psychology behind the movies is understandable. Like in the scene when the two ferry boats are each given a detonator. One boat holds innocent citizens while the other is filled with prison convicts. They are given the choice that either one boat blows up the other, or both will be blown. It turned out that neither boat was able to make the choice to murder the boat of other people. This psychology is highly understandable. A majority of the population cannot handle the thought of playing god and being responsible for taking someone?s life. So even though the scenario may be far-fetched, the psychology behind the people?s decision is completely understandable. Another point made by Nayman is the dark nature of the Joker. Nayman expresses his feelings that ??Ledger?s performance, which is easily the least comic screen take on the role to date, but it also points to why this incarnation of the character is so unsatisfying.? In this statement, Nayman shares his opinion that the Joker in The Dark Knight was the most wretched portrayal of the character he?s ever seen. He says that this creates an unsatisfying personification of a known killer. Personally, I think that this is a completely false idea. In Nolan?s Batman Trilogy, the stories are much darker; they revolve around the disturbed mind of Batman and his enemies. To me, this is where the Joker gets his appeal. His creepy, sadistic persona and twisted schemes form the film into a worrisome tale about how people will react to a tragic situation when they have a hero to turn to. Even the way the Joker switches the story about the origin of his scarred face, gives him so much psychological dimension. The Joker?s extreme darkness is what solidifies his character as so intense and interesting for the audience to become engaged in. Overall, I completely disagree with Nayman?s characterization of The Dark Knight as a ?flawed and overrated movie.? In my opinion, the film is interesting and complex, and the wickedness of the characters creates an engaging dystopian story. http://www.reverseshot.com/article/dark_knight",

Batman isn't what Christopher Reeve was as Superman, and as it fits the movie, people might appreciate it, in individual measures. People like Spiderman, not because what they connote to the 'Superhero' tag. I don't think anyone cares about his attire, or his swinging from buildings. When people see, that he does, when he is who he is, it appears that what he does, seems as really a distraction. \n It seems, Batman when Nolan started making it, used digital video, and the association to colour Video, is extremely different. I don't know, but Scottie isn't beamed down, and digital movies are beamed down from satellites. How the beautiful concept of motion photography can be captured and broadcast, is important, because it seems technicolour was not being used, for some time, even in concept.

        {
            "content": "As a film, \"The Dark Knight\" is not as infallible as people make it out to be. The problems are there, but they seem to be overlooked due to the focus on Heath Ledger's performance and the overall darker, more realistic nature of the film. Before looking at its problems, however, I want to acknowledge and discuss what's great about it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant attributes of this film is its dark, realistic tone. It's arguably the first major super hero film that tried to look at what might actually happen if a diabolical villain terrorized a city. In reality, he wouldn't waste time doing fanciful super villain deeds; he would simply start killing people until the hero took off his mask. And that is what the joker did. Indeed, this change of tone has done more than just satisfy its audiences; it has changed contemporary filmmaking. Have you noticed the darker tinge of all the recent super hero films? Have you noticed the villains getting more frightening and the storylines getting more complex and realistic? That is all due to this \"The Dark Knight.\"\r\n\r\nSecondly, Heath Ledger's performance is fantastic. It is the foundation of the film, and, let's face it, the real reason people love this film. In the end, it's not Batman or Harvery Dent that makes us come back to see it again and again; it's the Joker, with his combination of psychosis and intelligence. \r\n\r\nFinally, the film's score obviously had a lot of work put into it, and it does a good job at not only supporting the overall tone but also adding drama and suspense to the action scenes. This, along with the great cinematography and design, gives credit to Christopher Nolan's talent as a director.\r\n\r\nBut that talent only goes so far. Along with its great aspects, \"The Dark Knight\" has two major problems. The first is Harvey Dent. The turn his character takes simply does not make any sense. In one scene he is sacrificing himself for the betterment of the city and standing up to criminals everywhere. In the next, he is holding a gun to a boy's head. And why is this? Because his girlfriend gets killed? It just doesn't add up. Of course it would be fine if the film were overall more fantastic and unrealistic, but Nolan makes it obvious that he is emphasizing realism. Due to this, Dent's dramatic character turn just doesn't fit. With a lot more development it may have worked, but, alas, Nolan was already pushing it with the length of the film, and I'm sure the producers wouldn't have been happy with a half hour more about how and why Dent turned bad.\r\n\r\nThe second major flaw of the film is by far its most significant and ubiquitous. It can all be summed up by the fact that such a dark, realistic film was rated PG-13. PG-13? How cold that be possible? Wasn't the Joker cutting up some people's faces and executing others at point blank range? Wasn't this a really evil man? Unfortunately, he wasn't. And this is due to the severe editing and toning down of the violence, which is felt throughout the entire film. We know the Joker is doing bad things, but we don't ever really see them. The camera cuts away when he is supposed to kill the black mob boss with his knife. The whole scene is skipped where he breaks out of his cell and, as can only be imagined, he kills all the officers guarding him. And it's not just with the Joker; it's everywhere in the movie. In the final scene, Dent is not pointing the gun at the boy's head (which I'm sure would have given the film an R rating); he just has it near the boy. If we are to believe and appreciate how dark the film is and how evil the Joker is, we need to see it! We can't be satisfied by a PG-13 depiction of this sort of violence! Indeed, the tone and character of the film are directly contradicted by its dearth of violence and terror. Consequently, the film suffers. We simply don't get a fulfillment of the darkness that the film promises. Indeed, it's severe editing not only causes it to lose a lot of character development for both the Joker and Dent, but we also don't get a truly dark, realistic superhero film. We only get three-quarters of one. \r\n\r\nWhy does this happen? My best guess is money. I'm certain that at least part of Christopher Nolan wanted to make \"The Dark Knight\" as dark as its tone insinuates, but perhaps pressure from the producers or simple greed made him tone down the film to get its PG-13 rating. With such a rating, many more people could see it, and it made a lot more money. Unfortunately, however, this sacrificed its chance at true greatness and originality. We are only given part of a film, and because of this, it cannot even be seen as one of the best of the decade. In the end, I can only say one thing to Christopher Nolan: I hope it was worth it.",

Heath Ledger as the Joker has added a more mature, adult layer to the character. But to say that his is the overall stand out performance in the film is unfair. Everyone is strong and consistent throughout, not least Nolan's well-paced direction. I think it is perhaps a little bit gimmicky at times, but that doesn't let the film down. Finally we get a string of comic book adaptations that have depth, character and do the Batman series justice. Nice one.",

As Gotham City Is Under Threat To A Criminal Mastermind, The Joker (Heath Ledger).\n\n   Christopher Nolan's second installment of his Batman trilogy, is not only the greatest superhero/comic book film of all time, but also one of the best films of all time.

Nolan pulls from a plethora of rich resources to construct a complex, yet engaging story. Deep emotion drives the character's every move, while the plot emits a fascinating energy that propels the viewers into each scene. The Dark Knight redefines the super-hero genre by rescaling the story of one individual into the lives of Gotham's everyday citizens, creating a multiplex of subtle themes that call for the rise of a plebeian hero. Nolan magnifies the scope of his tale by adding mortal elements of vulnerability and fear, evoking a sympathetic notion that highlights the human nature of Gotham's finest. The Dark Knight triumphs in a hero that dwells in our very own circumstance, battling a villain that caricutarizes society's capacity to harbor chaos and anarchy as a response to fear. Heath Ledger's electrifying performance as the Joker is the catalyst by which our plot unfolds, unleashing a torrent of commotion that fuels the passionate performances of the protagonists. While the film seeks to occupy the everyday familiarities, it also construes a surreal notion of capturing the most dramatic moments with little regard to the temporal continuity of the plot. The Dark Knight ultimately covers more ground with an extensive approach to montage editing, always keeping one step ahead of the audience's mind. Nolan assembles one of the finest masterpieces of recent times by maintaining a sharp edge amidst the prevalent woes of many other big-budget, blockbuster features that neglect depth and vision for mindless substitutes that lack in artistic innovation.",

I found myself loving the performances and even some of the creative action sequences played out. I even enjoyed the first half. Than Nolan's film began to make unnecessary twists and turns that marked self-indulgence. The movie did not even know where it was going and suddenly I felt repulsed by it. It's so bloated with self-indulgence and characters that do not even make sense. It's not a humanistic movie, but it's not dehumanized either. It just does not make sense. Yes, Ledger is great. Yes, Bale's great, but is this movie great? Absolutely not.",

It's a controlled cinematic explosion!! It's bursting at the seems with drama, romance, humour, passion, chaos, and superior acting! But never does one of those things take control!! This film offers some truly wonderful performances!!\n\nChristian Bale, caped crusader! Ever does Christian bale understand how to act in that mask! To draw in an audience, with nothing more than his eyes n jaw! There is so much pain in that suit, and never does it leave it! This films marks it success in many ways but to have the title name of the film, and be quite satisfied without the Batmans presents and souly Bruce Wayne! That is the mark of a true actor! \n\nHeath Ledger- well jack Nicholson once designed and crafted his own joker, and what a joker it was! Memorable and mesmerising! Heath ledgers joker is film heroin! You never want this character off screen, and when he is, you want him back! Ledger has crafted a villain that will live in our hearts and minds forever!! Oscar awarded with his performance and rightfully so! Thank you for a true on screen creation! \n\nAaron Eckhart- Eckhart plays DA Harvey Dent, and in this performance he battles with a dual personality, competitive love, and a passion for justice! Gothams white knight! Eckhart brings such sorrow and sympathy fir this character! Watching the battles he faces is heart braking to see!!",

            "content": "Just an epic super hero movie, that isn't as much of a super hero film as it is an epic crime film. I like stuff that's real, and this had more of a real feel to it. It was more revolved around real people, and it didn't have some cheesy story, or a cheesy villain. The Batman is a symbol of hope for the city of Gotham, and he helps fight the mob with the police. The first one is when he began, but this is when he has made a huge difference in the city, and when he is forced between the borderline of hero and vigilante. In the Dark Knight series he is what ever the city needs him to be. Weather it is a hero, criminal, vigilante, or just a symbol. \nHow this film is the most different from the 3: In Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight Rises the villains are trying to destroy the entire city, and the people in the city all panic, and there is rioting. In this one it is Batman against one man. The Joker is trying to take away all hope for the city of Gotham, and show how crazy the city is because of Batman, and he wants to turn the city against him. Batman has to reveal his true identity, to save lives, but he knows he shouldn't because he will get arrested, and the city will be in big trouble. This one, and the Dark Knight Rises are the two that have the most conflict for the Batman. \n\nNow Heath Ledger is everything everybody will tell you he is. He became the Joker. He blew Jack Nicholson right out of the water. Jack Nicholson played a funny, and silly Joker. Heath Ledger plays a really scary Joker, that is creepy, and terrifying as it gets. He played the role so well, that the other cast members admitted that they forgot their lines because they thought he was so scary. All of the little details that go into his performance of the Joker, such as the facial ticks, the voice, his laugh, and creepy facial expressions were all so perfect. There are so many scenes where you are amazed by how good he is. Heath Ledger obviously had an amazing range as an actor. He played a gay cowboy in Brokeback Mountain, the son of a nasty racist man in Monsters ball, and then he comes out and plays the greatest Joker of all time by far. The makeup job they did with him was fantastic, because it didn't cover his face evenly in every area. That made him look even more frightening, and like some guy who you wouldn't even be able to speak when you say him. You can't even tell it is he, because of his acting, and his makeup. He has this genius master plan to beat the city of Gotham, and turn the city against Batman. One of my favorite lines is \"Do I really look like a guy with a plan?\" He actually did. Though he is an evil psychopath, he is really smart. \nI loved the scene when he blows up the hospital, and as he is walking away he never look back until the explosion stops, and he has to figure out the remote. Then when it works he runs away, and never looks back. That was really good acting on Heath Ledgers part that made the scene even more convincing. Also when he is about to say to blow up the boat, and then he asks batman \"Did I ever tell you how I got these scars?\" You really want him to say another story. There were many scenes like that where you want too see more. Like the scene where he says we are going to have tryouts. I wanted to see what happened in that scene. \n\nAaron Eckhart I thought was the 2nd best person in the film. He played the very likeable Harvey Dent. Harvey Dent is the savior of Gotham, and has put so many criminals behind bar, and he did it without a mask. His fight against organized crime is the first successful one that was legitimate, Gotham has ever seen. He is in love with Rachel Dawes who is also Bruce Wayne's love interest. Bruce tries to steal her from Harvey, which he doesn't. Harvey does some really heroic things such as claiming he is the batman so the real batman won't have to turn himself in to save everybody from the Joker. The joker's master plan in the end made Harvey Break bad. Half of his face gets completely burnt, and he becomes two-face. Why Aaron Eckhart is good in this, is because he plays the loveable Harvey Dent who is the symbol of hope for Gotham city, and he also plays the villain Two Face. \n\nThere are certain themes and sayings that are really awesome in this movie that are famous now. Such as \"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain,\" and \"Some men just want to watch the world burn.\" This movie is just like candy it's so sweet in so many areas. The action is amazing. The bat mobile is awesome, but the Bat pod is just so cool. I love the huge tires it has, and it looks so real. \n\nThe film has a few similar scenes from the Batman where Jack Nicholson was the Joker. Jack Nicholson stood in the middle of the street saying come on and hit me, while Batman was flying at him with his plane. He flew over him because he didn't want to kill him. Heath Ledger stood there with a shotgun saying, \"Come on hit me, I want you to do It.\" while batman was driving to him on the Bat pod. Batman drove around him, and crashed because he didn't want to hit him, just like Michael Keaton did with Jack Nicholson. Jack Nicholson fell from a tall building to his death. Heath ledger nearly fell to his death, until Batman saved him. The two films have some similar scenes like that, but the Dark Knight is better because it is much more serious. Batman is supposed to be dark, which is why this is so much better. \n\nThe only things that I thought were bad in this film were the way the Joker escaped from the prison. Well it was actually an awesome scene, but obvious, and stupid the way he did it. They wouldn't leave a guard in the interrogation room with him. They left him in there so he could escape. Also when he is holding the knife to his neck, and asks for his phone call, they would shoot him because he left his head open. Also he wouldn't be able to talk to Harvey Dent in the hospital, because they evacuated all of them. You would think that the first thing they would do is evacuating Harvey, because he is the city's district attorney, and not just leave him in the hospital. The Joker wouldn't have gotten a chance to get to him. But those are the only reasons why this didn't get a ten. Other then that it was an amazing movie. So so sweet. It was like candy and sugar it was so sweet. I am so bummed that the film that came after this was the last one. They got better and better with each movie, and there was so much left that he could have done with this trilogy.",

Furthermore, the strength also lies in the characters, so well defined whether it is the titular vigilante or the historical enemy The Joker portrayed in an intense and compelling way by Ledger, whose premature death took place prior to the release of the film. And while the photography stuns and the effects amaze, it is clear to see all throughout that everything in this film seems right, and everything after this film would never be the same for a genre that had been heavily commercialised since its inception.",

Forget the old batmen, even keaton these will go down not just as the best superhero film, but also as some of the best movies of all time. Christopher nolans pulled an amazing thrilogy.",

Also the cast is absolutely amazing, Christian Bale, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart, Gary Oldman, and of course Heath Ledger. This is and will be for a very long time the best interpretation of the Joker you will ever see in film. He steals every scene he's in and it's no wonder why he won an Oscar for best supporting actor. It's the performance of  a career.  I can't help but tear up at the end when Batman is riding off through the tunnel being chased by the cops and Gary Oldman is doing that really epic voice over \"Because he's the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not a hero. He's a Silent Guardian. A Watchful Protector. A Dark Knight.\"",

He took Batman and Gotham to an even darker place with great characters that are well fleshed out and explained during the film without slowing down the pace of it or stopping the action/ story telling. The script is fantastic and the themes promoted make sense to the characters motivations. One of the biggest credits I can give this is that there is so much going on during the 2 and a half hour run time, yet Nolan balances it all perfectly. There are of course great performances in this, as there are in all of Nolan's films, but Ledger's in particular is one of the greatest of all time. He took the character of the Joker to lengths no one expected. What I love though is you spend your the last 40 minutes or so of this movie on the edge of your seat and the end scene is perfect. So satisfying. This film is as iconic as they come and deserves the title of being the greatest comic book movie of all time. Because it is. Without a doubt.",

I was worried when I heard ledger was doing the role and especially taking into consideration jack nickleson's performance as the original joker but he completly turned the role into a much darker, troubled and less comic character, that still makes you laugh and makes you feel like you shouldn't be. Bale gives a good performance again as Batman despite his voice getting deeper and deeper as the movie progresses. The joker is a menace but not just a thug he likes to mess with peoples minds and turn what appears to be mindless crime into heavy moral decisions. Does the Joker have what it takes to turn Batman from loved hero into hated vigilante? It's difficult to stop a man who just wants to see the world burn. Biggest complement I can pay is in my opinion this is not just the best Batman movie ever but the best superhero movie I've seen. One of the best cinema experiences I've ever seen but can't help thinking where can Nolan go from here!?! My hearts crying out for more but my heads saying leave it at that.",

            "content": "The second installment of Nolan's epic series, The Dark Knight also happens to be my personal favorite. While not as dark as the first (in both cinematography and story), it is certainly more chaotic. The theme of the movie is order vs chaos, first laid out as Batman vs vigilantes, then Harvey Dent vs Batman, Batman vs Joker, etc. As the movie tactfully lays out, they aren't necessarily opposites, but sometimes one in the same, and sometimes creating each other. Heath Ledger is superior to the Jack Nicholson version of the Joker, and fits this trilogy perfectly, being more realistic and less cartoonish (though how realistic is a guy wearing clown makeup), sometimes hilarious, occasionally terrifying, and always certifiably creepy. The action sequences are better than the first installment for sure. Harvey Dent is played decently enough by Aaron Eckhart, and Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine all continue to give great performances. The only downgrade here is Rachel, played by the talentless Maggie Gyllenhaal, but it can be forgiven as Katie Holmes didn't set a high standard. Sometimes it seems the movie is too long, but it's a well-written story with multiple surprises that make it unpredictable and very enjoyable. I think it's the best superhero movie of all-time, and an absolute must-see.\n\n4.5 stars: Excellent",

Of course, it's impossible to discuss the film without first touching on Heath Ledger, whose magnificent turn as the Joker unconscionably steals the show from the very moment he appears on the screen. Magical moments, memories and faces routinely come and go on the silver screen, but a role this iconic only comes around once or twice a generation, and the power of his appearance has been amplified over the years. Ledger deserves every bit of the credit he reaped for the part, even if his untimely demise may have heightened the hype to superhuman levels. The things his character gets to do, say, and imply are downright remarkable, and really elevate this from a very good superhero movie into a brilliant social commentary that just so happens to revolve around a man with a cape, cowl and vast personal armory. As in Batman Begins, the supporting cast is heavily peppered with brilliant performances from Hollywood's heavy-hitters, with particularly excellent showings from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckhart, and once again Christian Bale masterfully inhabits the dual roles of Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's a great action movie, detective story, political thriller, superhero flick and moral tragedy, never feels half as long as its 152 minute run time lets on, and sticks the landing in every single important scene.

Maggie was the weakest link for me, as \"nice\" as she is i think maybe they could have found someone a little...mmm...how do I say this...mmm...oh yeah- hotter! My only other criticism is the use of the \"sonar\" technology - went on a little long. \n\nNolan is such an amazing director/writer, i totally bought into this world and believed every choice that was made by these characters. \n\nOne thing Nolan missed, when the Joker says to the Batman  \"You complete me.\" the line should have been \"I wish I knew how to quit you.\"  Maybe they can do a re-edit for the DVD.\n\nLast thing, I loved how all the characters only refer to him as THE Batman, so cool.",

            "content": "Reprise the stellar cast and sincere performances, but this time Christian Bale is more comfortable and powerful in his role as Bruce Wayne, and more believable as Batman.  Aaron Eckhart is a very believable Harvey Dent, and his transition to Two-Face, while somewhat abrupt, lends itself to feelings of despair.  The only blow to the cast is the absence of Katie Holmes, who played a more serious and down to earth Dawes; Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance is adequate on it's own, but falters slightly when measured against her predecessor.  However, it's Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker that leaves the biggest impression; every tone, every facial expression, every gesture is compelling.  Heath Ledger does a fantastic job of portraying the Joker as an \"agent of chaos,\" a madman interested only in confusion and destruction, Batman's penultimate nemesis.  Ledger's performance leads the audience to almost feel an understanding of such a character, in concert with an impression of believable unpredictability.  Another powerful tool is employed when the film actually incorporates complaints about the first film as improvement/evolution of the Batman, his arsenal and his _modus operandi_ that occur in this film.  Finally the story, with its span and complexity, driven by its characters and ambiance - just as was Batman Begins, which was a journey of self-discovery on which the audience accompanied Bruce Wayne - feels like a journey into the heart of Gotham.  This film is quite probably the best super-hero motion picture to date.",

            "content": "It's worth noting that, four years after its success made the big summer superhero movie less the pleasant resurgence it was after Batman Begins and more of an annual (and oftentimes grudging) obligation, The Dark Knight still stands as the apex of the genre. Part of that, of course, is just because it's a terrifically entertaining movie. Like most Hollywood sequels, it ups the spectacle of its predecessor; but unlike most, it does so while also telling a more ambitious and rewarding story. And though by the third act one definitely feels the strain of the two-and-a-half runtime, those 150 minutes are astonishingly some of the tensest I've ever experienced: it's telling that two of the most frequently recurring motifs in Hans Zimmer's score sound like a ticking clock and a siren. Most of that intensity can be traced directly to Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, which is riveting not because of his untimely death (if that was the case, wouldn't we be canonizing The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus?), but because he's just that good: he takes the madcap anarchism of Jack Nicholson's 1989 performance and injects it with a barely restrained, and genuinely terrifying, sense of menace. After a first film in which, despite entertaining turns by Liam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul and Cillian Murphy as the Scarecrow, Batman still ended up carrying the movie, it's kind of nice to see the villain steal the show again as nature intended.\n\nFor me, though, The Dark Knight's real achievement is in the liberties it takes with the superhero genre--or, for that matter, the mainstream action movie in general. I can't recall any other blockbuster from at least the last 30 years where the hero's victory is as pyrrhic and ambiguous as Batman's is in this film. Indeed, like a great revisionist Western, The Dark Knight isn't really about \"heroism\" in the unproblematic sense at all, but rather about the place of violence in contemporary society, the tensions between law and disorder, and the ethics of societal control in the face of chaos. How many other mainstream American movies, much less summer popcorn flicks, so thoroughly call into question the motives and justification of their protagonists, asking us not only to parse the differences between \"good\" and \"evil\" but to acknowledge their complex interrelatedness, the culpability the former can have in creating the latter? These questions, of course, don't always have ideologically convenient answers. Critics on both sides of the political spectrum have interpreted The Dark Knight as an apologia for the War on Terror and the police-state anxieties of the Patriot Act; I don't agree with those particular conclusions, but I can see where they're coming from (just like I can see that, on one level, Batman can look like a right-wing plutocrat who solves problems alternatively with his money and his fists and thinks he is above the law). But the fact that we are able to come to those conclusions, even if they're unappealing to us, is part of the point of moral ambiguity; and I think a film like this, one that challenges and unsettles us even as it entertains, is something to be celebrated, and one of the best arguments for commercial cinema I can think of.",

Christian Bale does an amazing job as Batman and Heath Ledger does an even better job at embodying the insanity and the ruthlessness of the Joker, and no one can top his performance.

            "content": "Where do we begin? A year ago, these cops and lawyers wouldn't dare cross any of you. I know why you won't go at night, the Batman. \n\nIts simple. Kill the Batman. \n\nFirst off, I'm gonna go ahead and devote a VERY large chunk of this to the stellar and groundbreaking performance of Heath Ledger as The Joker. He was awesome! He made Joker almost human. He wasn't just some crazy guy dressed up like some clown. In fact, his appearance wasn't even referenced to as clownlike apart from his henchmen. To me, Heath made Joker a man who was  ,in some sort of insane way, very down to Earth and realistic. He's got a method behind the Joker's madness. The Joker was right in his own twisted way. He knew what the world was. He saw the Earth for the monster it was and unfortunately, he let that monster consume and spit him out as a monster himself. Heath Ledger forever redefined this longtime enemy of the Batman and I pity the man who has to try to top Heath's performance. In his final film, Heath Ledger gave us arguably one of his greatest, if not the greatest, performance of his career. His wicked performance even won him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Soo...Heath Ledger, we thank you for gracing us all with a beautiful portrayal. \n\nNOW...onto the movie itself. Okay, it topped Batman Begins on multiple levels such as acting, action, storyline and realism. I've seen TDKR and I still prefer this one. It was just so much better. Heath Ledger as The Joker was a much more fun character than Tom Hardy as Bane, obviously and he was planning to take Batman's city and turn it against him right in Batman's face whereas Bane just simply wanted to destroy Gotham. Christian Bale as Batman? ...Eh. He was better than George Clooney. Even though I prefer Michael Keaton, I've got to give my condolences to Bale. He really did work into this film. He was a great Bruce Wayne and an ok Batman. If anything, the problem I have with Bale is that hacking noise he makes as Batman. Ugh...he's everything Batman should and would be but do they have to make it sound like he swallowed an entire stick of bread? In some scenes in TDKR, he growls so much you can't understand what he's saying. That is my real only gripe about Bale as the Bat. \n\nThis movie gave us a harsh and grim look at what society could do during a war between a vigilante and a terrorist. How far a world without rules could go to survive and how quickly one man can turn everything upside down. It also gives us a glimpse of how quickly heroes like Harvey Dent can fall vulnerable and become corrupted. Christopher Nolan mixed these elements all in and he gave us arguably the greatest Superhero film in a long time. Be sure to check it out and be amazed.",

Alongside Nolan stands a brilliant cast  of Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, the late Heath Ledger and others, who all contribute in bringing the film to life. The story is near flawless, keeping you on the edge of your seat and leaving you excited, frightened, hopefull, then hopeless. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's music speeds up the movie in scenes of action and thrill but also slows down the film in moments of fear and emotion. I was blown away when I first saw The Dark Knight, and between 2008 and now, I have viewed it many times. If you have yet to see this masterpiece, then I hope my review has convinced you to.

Nolan went alot darker with his sequel and the result was a superhero film which could have been a gangster film. For Heath Ledger to receive an oscar for a performance in a superhero reboot then need I say more about how perfect is was. The main trait of this movie which I felt the Dark Knight Rise's lacked was the various scenes of Bruce Wayne talking to Harvey Dent, Commissioner Gordon....  and it must have made the dialogue just fall on to the page as Jonathan Nolan was writing it. It created the perfect situations for subtext and probably made the actors job on this film a dream too. The film revolves around Bruce Wayne (the Dark Knight) attempting to pass the mantle to Harvey Dent (the White Knight) in order to spend the rest of his days with the love of his Life Rachel Dawes. But like all good superhero movie's it never turns out the way they want it. It leads to an explosive finally where we learn that even the incorruptible can eventually be broken and leave's Bruce Wayne no alternative then to stick to his guns and take the wrap. The film is very clever by hardly ever using the word hero... he's a silent guardian and this perfectionism doesn't stop there... its in every line of dialogue, every costume.... every stunt. The opening scene alone will leave you satisfied as it's a mini short film within a feature. My favourite line of the whole movie is \"this is what happens when an immovable object meets an unstoppable force\" and for me this is the sole reason Dark Knight Rise's fell short. Christopher Nolan's Batman and Joker are the perfect arch rivals. It's in my top ten and IMDB's top ten films of all time. Watch it and I doubt you won't feel the same way.",
