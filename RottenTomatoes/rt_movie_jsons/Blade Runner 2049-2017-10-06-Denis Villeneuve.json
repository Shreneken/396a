Ryan Gosling portrays K very well, slowly progressing from a stone-cold killer to a more unstable man questioning his entire reality. Harrison Ford still has  great charisma in this film, and you can clearly tell that he was excited to return to his character once more, unlike in The Force Awakens.",

A gorgeously crafted movie that has pioneered the conventions of cinematography accompanied by its immsersive and droning soundscape, thereby successfully reserving its spot in the pantheon of groundbreaking films. The brutalist architecture, overwhelming landscapes that swallow characters, contrasting color palettes like drowning irradiated Los Angelinos in a bright orange hue, these define the film and qualify it as an everlasting experience through a myriad of visual beauty. However, the story is dragged out and can seem overly long, but each shot is masterfully carried out, and that deserves the viewing and praise. I am forever perplexed how this marvel flunked at the box office. Its soundscape and cinematography surely were elevated in the experience.",

At nearly 3 hours long, you're taken on a lengthy investigation to discover the origins of said secret, yet the movie keeps you engaged and interested through its entire runtime. The cast all deliver great performances, specifically Gosling and Jared Leto (who plays, you guessed it, a creepy guy). The stunning scenery and set design fully immerse you in this futuristic world, and the music perfectly complements every scene it's utilized in. This film also has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen, and from a visual standpoint, is truly a work of art. While I'm admittedly not a fan of the original, I enjoyed this sequel much more. A riveting sci-fi mystery (you could even call it a detective story) with some gorgeous camerawork and an unexpected twist or two, \u2018Blade Runner 2049' is more than worth your time and will linger in your mind long after the credits roll. \n(Side note: I would recommend watching the original first, as you'll probably understand and enjoy this one more.)",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this movie. I wish I could have seen it sooner, I watched it for the first time 2/11/23. The movie goes through so many highs and lows for our main character while telling a beautifully crafted story. The movie has themes that are eerily similar to what people can experience in real life. Like the feelings of searching for a purpose, truly feeling alone, struggling to know what to believe in, feeling like a slave, being trapped, losing a loved one, and feeling like your life is meaningless. I know a lot of movies can show these emotions and feelings, but the way this movie goes about it is special. I also think this is Ryan Gosling best work I have seen. The way he portrays this character really makes you really feel connected with him and his journey. He also somehow brings this emptiness and sadness that I have never seen in a character. The movie is also a cinematography masterpiece. It has beautiful and breathtaking visuals with equally dark and scary visuals. You really feel like this dystopian future is really not that far fetched and you could be looking at it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is struggling with trauma or depression. You can really relate to this movie which can help cope with those emotions but it also could be a trigger. This movie does have a heavy emotional impact. I would also recommend this movie to anyone else over 18+. There is some hard concept to grasp and a fair amount of gore, violence, and nudity. After watching this film for the first time I knew it was already one of my favorite films. I would highly recommend giving it a watch.",

On its own merits, it is a very strong film; as a sequel, it's nothing short of brilliant.\n\nThe performances of Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford are outstanding and their onscreen chemistry suggests an evolution of masculinity within the films. The world building is immaculate, full of true wonder, and keeps you under its spell all the way to the very end. In some ways, it even surpasses the original.\n\nThe story is a methodically structured puzzle, solved through slow but persistent drips of revelation. The director, Denis Villeneuve, achieves a cerebral and even touching picture, while also accomplishing an uncommonly sublime production, marks Blade Runner 2049 as a landmark in the science-fiction genre.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this film to all hedy science-fiction fans, as it is a new chapter, a triumph, and a cinematic miracle. A must-watch for any cinephile.",

The protagonist in Blade Runner 2049 Agent K is like the protagonist in Blade Runner Rick Deckard. He gets frustrated a lot because it's difficult for him to solve a puzzle as a cop. The character Luv in Blade Runner 2049 is like the character Roy because she wants to be more human, only she tries to achieve her goal by doing evil. \nThe world created in Blade Runner 2049 is fascinating because, like the first Blade Runner it's always night and raining. The director has his own style by making it a world that's snowy and cloudy as well. Most of the action takes place indoors or outdoors of the futuristic world. There's action when the bad guys capture Rick, when Agent K finds him in a city or town. Lighting is used to highlight the action.  For example, an orange lighting is seen when he finds Rick.   It is revealed that for all these years Rick has been spending time in an abandoned casino.\n\tThe casino looks very futuristic and techno like. It shows holograms of Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and Marilyn Monroe. The holograms appear in a place that looks like a bar and another place that looks like a restaurant. The holograms make sounds which is a little disturbing and this happens when K and Rick are fighting.\n\tBlade Runner 2049 is worth seeing because it's brilliant with its visuals and script.",

I found myself rewinding scenes just take it all in. I wonder what master pieces we would have if Mr. Villeneuve was allowed to touch Star Wars or Star Trek. If this movie was longer I would still watch it. It is one of those movies you do not want to end because you are absorbed by it and are submerged in its creative universe. The acting was perfect, casting was perfect, dialogue on point, scenes and cgi were perfection and action sequences leaves you at the edge of your seat and finally the story telling was delicious.

But it may also be one of the film's biggest strengths as it decides to owe nothing to anything but itself and its predecessor, resulting in a confident, singular vision.

The secret of the naturally born replicant unveils smoothly. As the audience follows Officer K, they learn the different facts about the case. When they reach the end, the parts of the case merge to deliver a plot twist that will leave the audience speechless. The plot of Blade Runner 2049 is story writing at its finest. \nThe film will not only entertain the audience, but it will also make them think and feel.

Where do you draw the line? This movie leaves you thinking for days and weeks after. If you haven't read the book \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" or seen the first movie, you may need to read up on some background after. But I think this movie is enjoyable even without understanding the background. My only regret is that I didn't see the movie in theaters. The only big turnoffs I can point out to potential viewers are the length and the fact the movie is a bit of a slow burn.

People certainly won't be listening to this generic Zimmer score 30 years from now like they still listen to Vangelis original Blade Runner soundtrack.\n\nAnd the additional frustration of being told \"you just don't get it\" and \"oh, you're part of the attention deficit audience problem\".

            "content": "The day before yesterday, I watched one of the most acclaimed and philosophical sci-fi movies of all time: \"Blade Runner\". 35 years later, Denis Villeneuve (Ridley Scott this time was executive producer only) directed a sequel that gets two rare achievements: first, it maintains the original's essence, expands its universe, and the protagonist is as charismatic as Rick Deckard and it's not swallowed by him when both are on screen; and second, IT SURPASSES THE ORIGINAL! If the 1982 film was philosophical, this one is PHILOSOPHICAL with capital letters and maybe bold. While in that film we followed a journey of self-discovery of a supporting character, here we follow the protagonist's journey of self-discovery; he's actually solving two cases: the case that the LAPD assigned him (the external one) and the subsequent case that a piece of evidence put on his \"mind\" (the internal one). 30 years have been passed, it was incredible to see how the world has evolved and how the replicants have evolved; the dynamic between humans and replicants are completely different now, which impeded the screenwriters (the same of the 1982 film) to tell the same type of story. It's still an action/sci-fi movie, but they knew what made \"Blade Runner\" so special and invested in that sector. Ryan Gosling is perfect as K: inexpressive on the outside (he's a replicant after all), but as the film progresses, his emotions start to be de-bottled. Harrison Ford is a legendary actor and Rick Deckard is possibly his third most famous character, only behind Han Solo and Indiana Jones; Deckard's cold personality is maintained here, and Gosling proved how good he is by not being obfuscated by Ford's presence. Ana de Armas' character is by far the most intriguing: she, in personality, looks like Karen (Plankton's computer wife from \"SpongeBob: SquarePants\") but with a human body, and she's possibly the pivot of K's internal journey (alongside Mackenzie Davis). Dave Bautista and Jared Leto have little screen time but their characters aren't forgettable, Sylvia Hoeks is a cool and dangerous antagonist, and Robin Wright remembered me of Judi Dench's M from Daniel Craig's 007 franchise. The cinematography, soundtrack and sound work are DAZZLING; this movie is definitely a sensory experience, and I'm really jealous of those who watched this masterpiece in a movie theatre. Oh, and I still keep with my theory that Rick Deckard is a human.",

I feel especially sure of that because of how uninteresting I found this particular plot to be, a similar feeling I had to the first one. The incredible sense of magnitude and hidden depths and mystery that their impeccable setting offers led me to appreciate even less how ultra-low the plot's stakes were. I didn't agree that killing the replicants was necessary in the first place (at least in the context of the movie; I'm aware the novel is different) and tracking down the kid was just not a riveting premise for me. My opinion was reduced even further when they directly tied Deckard into it instead of just having him show up to help as it implies that in all of the gigantic cityscape the only two interesting things to have ever happened involved him. As with the first movie I feel I would appreciate this (which essentially serves as a requel) more if it began a franchise where better stories are told in the same universe.",

Firstly, Roger Deakins was very much deserving of the Oscar he won for cinematography. Each shot is museum worthy. And Villeneuve and the rest of the creative team brought to life again this dystopic vision of a cyberpunk future LA, and it remains enchanting. I also love the route they take with this story, centering on a Blade Runner who knows he is a replicant instead of rehashing the is-he-or-isn't-he question of Deckard from the first one. K's arc of slowly starting to believe that he is special only to find out that, in that one specific way, he is not was satisfyingly subversive. The parallelism of Luv, a replicant who also sees herself as special, is a great choice as well. Joi is another character that invites analysis, since we have to consider (as K does) if she was merely following her obvious AI programming to make K feel better or if she was able to reach some level of being a \"real girl.\" As with the original, it is a slow movie that really demands your attention. And as with the original, I feel this is a film that requires multiple viewings to truly have seen it. For now, 4.5 wooden horses (which was at the center of a great mystery in this story)",

His discovery leads him to find more about the truth and ends up finding Rick Deckard, a L.A.P.D. officer, who has been missing for 30 years.\n\nDenis Villeneuve is a Sci-Fi master and was able to put together an incredible piece of art. With the help of one of the best cinematographers working right now, the incredible Roger Deakins, and the help of the amazing Han Zimmer, Denis was able to present us with this Masterpiece.\n\nThis movie is everything a sequel should be it picks up the universe it's predecessor created and expanded it and somehow also made it more interesting. It created great new characters, which we were able to connect with, and was able to bring elements from the past with sublteness and intelligence.\n\nIt takes it's time and it's the opposite of the majority of the modern Sci-Fi movies. Its pace paired with the astounishing shots and the groundbreaking score allows us to connect with everything in this universe, it captures us and makes us prisioners of that world for the runtime of 2 hours and 44 minutes.\n\nThe story unrolls in quite an unique way, it's like every inch of dialogue matters and you really don't want to miss anything, just for the pleasure of connecting the dots and being able to feel everything. I wasn't expecting to be hit in such an emotional level.\n\nRyan Gosling was definitly the best casting choice. He absolutely nailed the role. Ana de Armas was also amazing and portrayed the role of the A.I. Cyberpunk girlfriend with ease. Harisson as always was a fucking badass. Carla Juri with little screentime was able to do a really great job portraying Rachael and Rick's long lost daughter.\n\nThis is one of the most beautifully shot movies I've seen, every look, every landscape, every face, every shot felt like it should be there and carried a lot with it. Loneliness and the sense of getting lost have never been so well portrayed in a Sci-Fi movie.\n\nThis is everything modern Sci-Fi movies should be.\n\nThank you Denis for making this Masterpiece, thank you Ridley for creating this world.

Although Scott's film had these in his it served to create a\nbelievable, if alien, and atmospheric world. In this one it just served\nto give the appearance of trying to convince idiotic Americans that\nsomething significant or profound was going on. If an intelligent man\nsaid they found this stylisation an original and artistic creation I\nwould believe him but for me, it was not that.\n\nThe characters too were often paper thin - the protagonist, with\ndesigner stubble and bomber jacket come trenchcoat, being played as hard\nboiled when he was obviously the prettiest boy in school, the hard\nhitting ageing blond tom boy boss with greased back hair who swore a lot\nand acted mean but in the end died for her employee, the sexy but deadly\nevil assassin in tight trousers, the weird psycho in some bizarre\nfuturistic version of a lonely mansion having no idea what a fruitloop\nhe is whilst seemingly performing some of the world's most complex\nscientific tasks with nothing more than a giant plastic bag, some slime\nand a floating camera for tools - all a little bit cliche for me.\n\nThe dialogue didn't do any better which at it's absolute best was\nsickeningly pseudo-philosophical with fake insight and dubious value.\n\nThat being said I did start to warm to the film a little, or perhaps\njust got used to it, then they brought in Harry. It felt a little like\nLuke Skywalker in the new Star Wars - these youngsters, actors and\ndirectors, need to bring in the old hands to give what they are doing\nsome depth, what are they going to do when there are no more old hands?\nBut Harry did bring a little depth, but not enough and he could not\nredeem the film.\n\nThe whole thing seemed like something that was created deliberately to\nmake money or make an impression but there seemed very little\noriginality or creativity in it, like a man making an unusual looking\ncake but underneath is just a sponge to a tried and tested recipe, it\ndid not feel like an artist's individual and personal expression.\nPerhaps it is the cinema version of contemporary art - pointless.\n\nI have come down harsh and perhaps there were some good things about\nthis film. Although like usual far too much CGI ruined the visual\nappearance and experience as a whole but it was moderately pretty in\nplaces. I imagine the Yanks will love it, but in the end, like so many\nfilms before, they should have just left Blade Runner alone.",

So this time I watch the 1984 final cut first. Honestly, except the last monologue, I thought that first movie was a snooze fest. 2049 improved a lot more than the 1984, but still I thought the pacing was a bit too slow. \n\nWhat's significantly better was the story, which was more intense and harder to predict than the first. There was also more characterization to the main blade runner, played by the subdued Ryan Gosling. He had to figure out his past, and the twists and turns made his journey much more interesting than Deckard in the 1984 movie. \n\nThe cinematography was undeniably top-notch. Almost every shot was breathtaking and gorgeous. Ana de Armas looked out of this world, just like she was in No Time to Die.\n\nOverall, I wasn't entirely onboard with the story, but I definitely enjoyed the beautiful look of the dystopian world. 8/10",

I know that in my review of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner I said that the movie was for me unclearly a masterpiece. I didn't really know what to think about it after seeing it but during the whole month I backed up a bit and realized the original was a tremendous masterpiece that I must rewatch. Which I will do soon. It was really innovative for the time it was made. It was perfect. The plot was simple but perfect. Vangelis' soundtrack and the cinematography too. And the final speech by Roy was so damn good. The philosophical questions this movie brings are so deep and I think about it a lot. But, what I want to say is that 2049 does almost the same thing as Blade Runner but maybe even better. It is a philosophical film about how humans and A.i live together so normally that at a certain point, humanity will be no longer the \"normal\" breed that is accompanied by a captivating directing and soundtrack. It is an immersive experience that you need to live. The only problem of this sequel is that I felt a bit lost about the plot.

No-one had any right to make a sequel to Blade Runner, but Villeneuve somehow takes the gauntlet and runs with it, managing to keep all the unanswered brain twisters still left to your own interpretations, and the way he keeps the story alive interspersing it with staggering world building is both a homage to the original, and very much earns the right to its own place in the Blade Runner universe.

Ryan Gosling, Ana de Armas, and Robin Wright are great.   Jared Leto is creepy and interesting, as he often is.  Ford's role is small but significant and well played.  The story is interesting and incorporates the predecessor in a sensible and meaningful way.    The film is visually very similar to the first, in its dark and intentionally sterile visual imagery.    There are some surprises.  The film shares some of the original's confusing elements; however it is good.  I watched it a second time and it is so layered and intelligent.   It can be watched as a stand alone but it ties so intelligently into the first one.   This is worth watching and watching again.

            "content": "Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel that goes toe to toe with the original Blade Runner in terms of riveting visuals, atmosphere and memorable dialogue. The makers were wise enough to make the movie its own in terms of design and pacing, use sound and music in a creative way to hark back to the original and use CGI in a restrained and an unobtrusive way. Although the pacing is not as tight as the original the writing is not afraid to push this futuristic story into uncharted and disturbing territories. Like the original story the police are hunting synthetic humanoids, but with a plot twist- synthetic humans are killed if they are outdated in favor of newer more obedient models. The Blade Runner hunting the synthetic humans is himself a stronger, more resilient, more lethal and more observant synthetic human. All of this takes place in a dystopian view of the future where the cities are gray sprawling overpopulated over-polluted industrial wastelands devoid of any beauty. A new corporation has arisen producing ever more efficient and obedient synthetic humans headed by a creative industrialist. Given that the newer and more obedient synthetic humans are even more efficient killing machines than before the movie suggests in no uncertain terms that the fault lies eternally with humanity as a savage and immoral maker and not the creation. The main character in the movie, the synthetic human Blade Runner \u2018K' also has a holographic female companion. The notion that artificial life will seek companionship from other artificial life forms seems strangely unsettling, as if it requires some sort of supervision or that the need for companionship is a unique trait restricted to humans. The need for a machine to have need for companionship also makes it appear as a drawback revealing an interesting assumption that we view machines as supposedly efficient, but not ourselves as machines or at least accept that we are \u2018inefficient machines'. Whereas the original Blade Runner raised philosophical questions Blade Runner 2049 makes our transgressions and prejudices visceral and pushes them right in front of the audience.  Whether it is the slimy birth of a new synthetic model, children working in factories, intolerance for artificial life procreating or the dismissal of the illusion of free will underpinned by genetics, the movie doesn't pull punches. In his search for the offspring of Replicants the Blade Runner \u2018K' navigates a hellscape of industrial excrement, but the most damning indictment is that humanity ultimately gave up on the real world and morality and lives in the ruins of past efforts to produce more and more tactile fantasies.",

I will get the criticisms out of the way: What Denis Villenueve was going for was a feel movie in the sense he lets the scenes breath so it takes quite a long time for someone to do something, which did affect on multiple viewings. It is longer than it should be. The positives are : The cinematography is the best I've ever seen in a film, every frame looks like a beautiful painting. The score by Hans Zimmer was incredible, kind of futuristic I loved it. Ryan Gosling is wonderful in this movie as was all of the cast. It had a great story and message about what it is and means to be human. Blade runner 2049 is one of my favourite movies, and it was my favourite movie of 2017!",

I've made about 25 minutes and I'm not engaged and need to switch it off. Maybe it's just too old for me. That's the assumption I've come to anyway So I'm giving this sequel a go in hope that a modern continuation of the story may help me enjoy it. \n\nBlade Runner 2049 starts off strong. Batista's brief cameo battling Ryan Gosling's \u2018K' is a strong opening to the movie and I have the assumption from this we're in for an action packed sci-fi extravaganza. I'm pretty wrong here I'll admit it now. The pacing of this movie is a problem for me. After that strong start, I assume they're building plot and the story. They are but it seems to last for a very long time. Every single time I feel it's about to speed up the story slows back down again. I remained engaged throughout but that's only through a conscious effort rather than a gripping tale. \n\nLook the premise for this movie is awesome. Even without seeing the first I love the idea of these artificial slaves having hope and a way of breaking their oppression. The movie just never speeds up even at the end of the film I'm left underwhelmed and a little disappointed. There's a few good moments but not any that blow me away. \n\nThe draw for this movie for me is the incredible visual demonstration we get. The film is beautifully put together and it literally jumps off the screen. I kind of wish I saw this at the cinema just to see how this came out on the big screen. I can imagine it was unreal. No matter how stunning the film is though it never blows my mind away just my eyes. \n\nThis film is fully advertised as being a combo of Ford and Gosling being the joint leads. The thing is though Ford doesn't turn up until an hour 45 into the film. He's only in it for the last hour and even then is not shown a great amount. The same with Jared Leto he's one of our main villains but he's barely shown and when he's on screen I find him a really dull character. \n\nThe star here is Gosling. He's absolutely brilliant as \u2018K' whose on his journey of self discovery and is breaking out of the way he's programmed. He goes on a great journey throughout the film and this is really his film and nobody else's. He's a brilliant action star and that's not something we see regularly from him. It's just a shame this film didn't have a bit more action for him to be involved in. If it did then my rating would have been much higher.",

It's interesting that the first Bladerunner movie was not a success financially when it came out. It has since come to be seen as a milestone in science fiction.  I think the same will be said about Bladerunner 2049. It will be looked upon as a cult movie.   \nThis movie is visually stunning. It has a deep meaning. It shows a glimpse of a possible future. \n Some movie critics criticize the movie for being over budget. They ask why it was necessary to spend $150 million on the movie when they should have known it would not do that well at the box office.  (same as the original Bladerunner).  What these accountants don't tell you is that you can't put a price on a work of art. This movie is a work of art. A work of art costs what it costs to make it. You can't cut corners when making art.   If you ask Picasso or Michelangelo to use cheaper paints, don't expect the same appearance in their finished product.  \n Yes, I am calling this movie a work of art - the highest praise I can give a movie. A work of art is something that I believe will last for decades at least.  It has a soul, an inner life. It is more than the sum of its parts. \n Before I close I will say one thing that is avoided by almost every review then I've read. The dialogue in this movie is amazing. There is not one line or even one word that is unnecessary. Everything that is said either advances the storyline or explains something.  Gosling asks Ford about a dog, \"Is he real?\". Harrison Ford could say, yes, no, or I don't know. Instead, he answers, \"Ask him yourself\".\nSo, crank up the projector in your man-cave or  bedroom TV., and make sure you have a good supply of snacks because the movie runs almost 3 hours including credits. Tempus Fugit when you're having fun!",

Though I think what is the hardest sell is Ryan Gosling's character.  In the first movie we seen a passionate lead character in with Ford.  He was hot tempered, impulsive, frustratingly doing the cold and dirty work of retiring replicants.

One of the best looking films I've ever seen, amazing visuals combine with an ambient soundtrack to stunning effect.

If you are a fan of the original, you will most likely enjoy this film. However, for most of the modern audience, the movie is seen as too slow. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the original, I was looking forward to watching this. I was not disappointed... for the most part. Aesthetically, the film looks absolutely stunning. Roger Deakins, who also did the cinematography for 1917, did an amazing job with Blade Runner 2049. I was even so amazed that I was sometimes distracted from the movie itself, which is a problem, I suppose. The story is somewhat similar to the original, asking the same questions, but it also adds the new element of replicas giving birth. This new fact has the potential to start a war, without giving too much away, the plot finishes in a very pleasing way. However, I did find that although Ryan Gosling is a great actor, he felt really stiff in this movie. More stiff than Harrison Ford, and that's saying something. The dialogue was also quite weak at times, but again, visually, it's absolutely amazing. I could honestly pick any frame of this as a background, and it would work. It is really a piece of art in that sense. The way that it merges the old and the new kind of reminds me of The Force Awakens, but in a way, I do think that this movie is better. I love this movie in so many ways, it looks amazing and asks some interesting questions, however, the script is sometimes dull and Ryan Gosling is stiff. But still, it's a wonderful thought provoking film that I would recommend, 8.2/10",

Personally, I think \"2049\" is even better than the original \"Blade Runner\" (which I think is a tad bit overrated) and might possibly be one of the best science fiction sequels in the history of movies, right up there with \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Aliens\".

The visuals are amazing and it is very entertaining despite its as previously mentioned slow tone . Would of been my favourite movie I\u2019ve seen so far , if not for ending . Maybe it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t watch the original but the end just did not work in my opinion . It just lost everything that made it great .

The female characters given names were not designated to have personalities, only relationships in terms of the main male character.\nWhile the visuals were nice, I can say the same about jellyfish livecams, which as a whole offer more to my overall quality of life than this movie did.\nI assume reading the books and watching some of the other movies might offer some insight into this inane and confusing movie, but after watching this I have no interest in learning more.",

I've never done this before for any movie.\n\nExtraordinary. Wonderful. A true masterpiece. Each time I see it, it gets better, deeper, and more profound. The script, direction and performances are flawless.\n\nThe gentle love scene with the hologram Joi actively blending with the real girl Mariette, matching their movements, to allow Joi to physically express her love for K is exquisite. Astonishing. The best and most extraordinary love scene I've ever experienced in the cinema. I wept.\n\nSo much of this movie is so profound, so searching and wonderful. The themes of identity, memory, and love are explored with joy and respect. I will see the movie again, in a week or so.\n\nBR49\nBR49 is the best movie I have ever seen. I'm 65 years old and see perhaps 50-60 movies per year. However, I did not realise how truly great it was until the second and third viewing.

It becomes more about memory than ever: memories of memories (such as the holograms of his lost love or of Elvis); memories of other people's memories (driving the characters); and our own memory of the first film.\n\nBecause of this reference to our own memories, the film is somewhat stuck to its prequel, and though this involves us intimately, it's not always in a good way. It breaks the fourth wall by constantly reminding us that we're watching a movie.\n\nHere we also see the phenomenon of how sequels are strait jacketed by the premises set down in the original. This always risks a slight block to creativity, and belabouring once fresh ideas, and worst of all, narrows the corridors and shrinks the maze in which the writers can roam.\n\nIf the majestic pace of the original was supported by Vangelis's heavy score, this one drags somewhat with less air in the musical balloon to haul it along. Not one theme is memorable, and the whole score sounds like a bad pastiche.\n\nSuffused with yellow light and wonderful performances, there is gold to be found here, literally, but nowhere near the treasure of the original.",

Its methodic, stoic and probably one of they must well shot films in recent time. Denis Villeneuve takes his time with his shots and lets the film unfold slowly. The twists and turns are layed out one after the other perfectly. Gosling plays a conflicted replicant blade runner who struggles throughout the film with the levity of the situation but in the end understanding that he is simply another cog in the works, a silent hero. Harrison Ford shows up and plays an old Rick Deckard excellently giving us a grisled performance. The orginal Blade Runner asked the question what makes us human? And 2049 continues that theme improving on the concept. Villeneuve shows us that in such a bleak world the lines are blured between humans and replicants and that its the idea of connection that makes us human.",

            "content": "Thirty years after the events of the first movie, Blade Runner 2049 follows the story of replicant K (Ryan Gosling) who unearths a secret that could rock the world to its core. I remember watching this for the first time and scoring it high 90's. While I still think it's a damn good movie, I feel it falls just out of Masterpiece range.\n\nActing: 10\nGosling was stellar in his performance as K. Replicants walk the line of being human, but robotic at the same time. In some cases Gosling provides responses that are straight out of the mouth of a program while there are some scenes that require him to capture raw emotion, both unexpected and welcomed by me as a viewer. There were some other memorable performances as well, particularly by Sylvia Hoeks in her role as Luv. I'll be honest, she frightened the hell out of me, but in a good way. She was calculated and controlled, but you could always sense a rage waiting to surface. I love what she did with this character.\n\nBeginning: 10\nThe opening scene of this movie sees K tracking down a replicant that's been trying to fly under the radar. The tension is built slowly before it bubbles over. In the climax of this scene, we get a taste of what is to come for the rest of the movie. That's what beginnings are all about: Leave us wanting more!\n\nCharacters: 10\n\nCinematography/Visuals: 10\nWhile the entire film as a whole may not qualify as a masterpiece, the visuals and cinematography most certainly are. Throughout the movie, you get a chique futuristic feel that's also dreary and dank at the same time. It's like you're watching two worlds collide. I love their play on robotics and weaponry here as well, definitely a step up from the first film.\n\nConflict: 10\nIt's not just about the action here, but also K unravelling a mystery before our eyes. You want him to get to the bottom of everything going on and you're taken on a wild ride along the way. Between the shootouts with hi-tech guns and the hand-to-hand fights, there is more than enough to keep you entertained. \n\nMy favorite scene in particular occurs when K and Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) meet for the first time and square off. They are in some kind of concert hall where holograms are performing. Both are relying on the singing of the holograms to improve their striking position. It really is fun to watch.\n\nEntertainment Value: 9\nIt doesn't take you long into this movie to realize you're watching something special. The time and energy that went into the creation of this movie shows up on screen. Yes, it could have been shortened, but I still had a great experience.\n\nMemorability: 10\nThere is a scene that sticks out in my head where replicant creator Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) is looking over one of his creations. It's unsettling to put it lightly and you feel like it's just an average monologue\u2026until it's not. There are a number of scenes just like this that press on my brain. I also loved the continued exploration from the last movie of what it means to be human.\n\nPace: 8\nI do appreciate that the story took its time to unfold. However, I do feel like it could have been a smidge faster in spots. There were a few moments where I was thinking, \"Man, I got things to do! Let's go!\" Mostly forgivable save for a few instances.\n\nPlot: 10\n\nResolution: 1\nWithout giving anything away, I will just say that this is my least favorite part of the movie. To have started so strong only to end like this? Not impressed. I wanted more for K is all I will say.\n\nOverall: 88\nThere's nothing like good sci-fi when done well. Blade Runner 2049 will take you on highs and lows while giving you a visual feast in the process. I was not disappointed in the least and you won't be either.",

            "content": "Denis Villeneuve had a near impossible task in producing a worthy sequel to one of the greatest films of all time Blade Runner (1982) and miraculously he does. Despite casting Ryan Gosling, the Harrison Ford of his day, in the lead when he could have picked a more interesting character screenwriters Hampton Fancher and Michael Green populate the film with fascinating characters like Luv and Niander Wallace. The film is almost as beautiful as it's predecessor and contains action scenes that equal the pursuit of Zhora while continuing the exploration of the philosophical questions asked in the first film. I had high expectations going in and I was on cloud nine for the rest of the week having had all of my expectations met.\n\nThirty years after the events of Blade Runner, \u00e2~blade runner' K, Ryan Gosling, discovers that replicants can sexually reproduce and is told by his commanding officer lieutenant Joshi, Robin Wright, to retire the offspring of Rachael. Meanwhile, Niander Wallace, Jared Leto, the successor to Tyrell sends replicant Luv, Sylvia Hoeks, to steal the remains of Rachael, the replicant who reproduced, so that he can use them for his own nefarious means. K, a replicant himself, comes to believe that he is Rachael's child when his memories match up to information he finds. As in the first film, there is a climactic showdown between hero and villain where the lines become blurred and philosophical questions are pondered.\n\nBy far the best aspect of the film is the exploration of Luv's character because she is the most emotionally affecting in the film. Her desire to her prove herself to her near psychopathic father Niander is never more clear than at the moment at which the body of a fellow replicant is carelessly disposed of as we see a single tear trickle down her otherwise placid face. Her physical abilities are also impressive as she is able to match K in their final fight and when she confidently states \"I am the best one\" I felt the sort of excitement I have only ever felt at the end of Krzysztof Kieslowski movies. She was emotionally complex and it was fun to watch her fight the male lead, what more could you want from the female lead in a Blade Runner sequel?\n\nAlthough I would not consider Harrison Ford to be a great actor and I felt the lack of development in the relationship between Rachael and Deckard was one of the few flaws of the first film their relationship produced one of the most emotional moments in the film. When Deckard stares at a hologram of Rachael and is tested on his response he responds tearfully \"I know what I felt\" as he recognizes that the hologram can not replicate the feelings he had for the Rachael he knew. Ford is surprisingly able to sell the seen as we see a man who cemented himself as a gruff action star give himself over to the emotion of love as the awe in his eyes as the woman he loves touches him again is beautiful and touching. Had Blade Runner dealt with the love story better this scene would have been even more affecting but this scene does a great job at making up time on the predecessor's poor treatment of Rachael and forces you to care.\n\nOf the many, many wonderful things about this film the cinematography is obviously high up on the list as Roger Deakins, returning from the first film, does some of his best work. There is the beautiful orange sheen present in most Deakins film present here but even more so as the Wallace corporation complex is absurdly colorized and reflections of flowing water appear on the walls. Each shot could be framed and put up on my wall, even those of Harrison Ford's confused face, with the exterior shots in particular feeling like worthy successors to the iconic Coca-Cola commercials of the first film.\n\nThis is a fantastic film that should definitely be watched after seeing the original film and it's an absolute miracle that this film is as good as it is because if there were a terrible Blade Runner sequel in the world it would be an absolute tragedy.",

The pacing feels like a wave that you can watch building on the horizon until its finally on you and you don't know what hit you; There is tension and meaning behind its speed. Speaking of waves, there is actually a scene in the movie where Hans Zimmer's music matches with the action to make you feel like drowning in waves.... so much cinematic innovation.

Global warming has not been kind; LA is in the year of winter powered by the perpetually sunny state of California which has been covered in stunning solar panel towers. There is a shortage of crops but we still have cigarettes as tobacco fields are both an important part of American GDP and a great way to make someone look bad ass in the movies.\n\nIf this film is in any way a prediction of the future it's good to know that technology gets way out of hand, also buy Mitsubishi shares now, diversify portfolio with Coca-Cola and sex bots.\n\nOn a side note I once read that after Return Of The Jedi, George Lucas held back on making any more Star Wars movies until the technology was right. That might also be fitting of Blade Runner. The film just can't fail to disappoint, visually it's stunning, with its vast landscapes, baron city ruins, fallout zones, mega cities, and technological fantasy.\n\nBlade Runner also captures a complex and obscure dystopian future featuring child slavery, android servitude, and a macho world of sexual obscenity not too dissimilar to Duke Nukem's Land Of The Babes. Technologically there is a lot to take in, from the delights of hover cars to mainstream JOI companionship, in 2049 Joi is a robot hologram who will risk everything in the pursuit of syphilis. One bit of technology that stood out was the 4D TV's, I mention as Back To The Future also predicted them so I'm thinking it's only a matter of time folks.\n\nThe plot is enjoyable, it neatly works on its predecessor's mind melt that people can't guarantee that they're human because memories are implanted faster than the NSA can access your webcam but it adds a twist with Replicants urging to be recognised as equals, and you get the sense that the Replicants are gearing up for a Hunger Games style conflict sooner or later.\n\nThe Replicant's call to war comes with the discovery of a child born of Replicant descent. So basically this is the plot from Orphan Black, a child born from a clone gets hunted down by an evil corporation so that they can do testing on its genetic structure or something.\n\nHowever unlike Orphan Black there is less logic behind the corporations motivations to recover the child, for instance if they really wanted to produce well behaved drones then reproduction might not be the best way of doing it, on the premise that you have more genetic uncertainties and less control over production and data analysis.  Also it seems as if Mr Wallace has created a technology which has garnered him huge wealth and he's left looking a bit like a one dimensional super villain suffering from a god complex, with very weak motivations and a lack of depth. \n\nMs Luv also fails to use the company's firepower to wipe out K which makes it feel a bit like a weak Bond movie at times because you never feel like he is in critical danger and the one question you come away with is why at any point in this movie wasn't K killed when he could have been.\n\nThe LAPD leader is like the love child of Theresa May and Mariano Rajoy and her motivations to quell rebellion before it kicks off a referendum are a bit easier to understand. This makes the plot a bit more tangible and if the corporations motivations were a bit meatier this film would have a more complete feel about it.\n\nBlade Runner also attempts to raise familiar questions in AI SciFi such as when is an android considered equal to a human, when does AI start to think for itself, can AI feel real emotion and if so does such emotion relate to independent thought. With that in mind, despite the weak plot points, Blade Runner offers total escapism into a bizarre world, worth seeing for the innovative technologies, abstract ideas and stunning landscapes.",

Beyond disappointing - a true let down. Not something I would recommend to anyone, really. For a movie that made so much a mystery of its plot and reveal absolutely nothing of significance in the end, I don't see any true value in casting such a vain story line - one that will without a doubt pass for one of the memorable  disappointment of my life.

But the reason for that in my eyes is the design. The way the city looks, the dank and dark lighting, the creepy humanoid animatronics and replicants, the haunting score. The world looks so cool an interesting in that movie. Unfortunately when you actually go and watch it again it doesn't hold up that well. The romance is creepy, consent absent form the love scene. It doesn't really explore its own theme of if robots can be people very well, the most compelling discussion to be had on that topic is in the what ifs the movie inspires, rather than the actual content. And I also just don't think the main antagonist makes much sense. He kills indiscriminately, he's a monster, but we're supposed to suddenly care when he spares one life? Bah. Anyway. This movie. Blade Runner 2049 is better than the original. The world is back, the amazing atmosphere, the music. It's a little less grimy than the original, but it also feels like the world has progressed. It's not all the same future-tech. In the years since the first story they have advanced and it makes the transition smooth. Making the protagonist definitively a replicant was a great move, really allows the entire film to ask whether androids dream of electric sheep and all that. Each element of the movie balances a really well constructed mystery, as well as all of the ideas making K wonder if he matters. The whole cast is stellar, except for Jared Leto, who somehow managed to get his name on the poster for turning in two scenes of hammy, out of place villain acting. It's a really compelling movie, and a kind of sci-fi that we don't see on the big screen very often. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "There is nothing as natural than for movies to spawn sequels. As inevitably as cats have kittens, successful movies will have one or more sequels. In typical fashion the adage, 'strike while the iron is hot,' is applicable. The follow-up movie will usually be released while the initial buzz created by the original is still in effect, usually within two to five years. Lately, several immensely popular action franchises have been reignited even though the principal actor were returning after a couple of decades absence. It remains a significant discrepancy between men and women in Hollywood, but the shelf-life of action heroes has been greatly extended. Last year one of the most controversial, enigmatic cult science fictions received a sequel, 'Blade Runner.' The original film, 'Blade Runner' was a loose adaptation of the 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? By Philip K. Dick, released in 1982. That film rose to a level beyond a mere cult classic, through the highest echelon of Sci-Fi fandom to a zeitgeist-defining cultural phenomenon. It is far from unusual for a major studio movie to have numerous versions, sifted through and re-edited by the filmmaker to achieve the final product. Elaborate DVD and Blu-ray sets released becoming cherished collector's items. 'Blade Runner' has enjoyed this venerated status for decades, and with the conclusion open to interpretation, many fans have hoped for a sequel. It took longer than most believed possible but thirty-five years that immortal monologue atop the Bradbury Building, 'Blade Runner 2049' has arrived. Set in 'real time.' i.e., thirty-five years after the original fans rejoiced when it was announced that Harrison Ford would reprise his role joined by one of the most popular actors of his generation, Ryan Remolds. Not only has this near-mythical film been made but the cast is ideal.\n\nOne of the goals for the film set by director Denis Villeneuve was to venture beyond extending the dystopic Blade runner universe to expand it. The visual impact made by the original change the way the future was depicted. The streets were crowded, rain seems to be constant and the looming buildings festooned with gaudy, animated billboard advertisement. The opening shot of this film depicts a car, on autopilot as its occupant, K (Ryan Gosling), waking from a nap. The wide-open vista of this scene contrasted with the start of the original tells volumes without needing dialogue. Although the landscape is bright with the palette sliding from blues to orange, the overall feel remains desolate, bordering on despair. K is a Blade Runner whose mission is to retire outdated or rogue replicants. There was a long-standing debate as to whether Decker (Harrison Ford), was a replicant himself. K is unmistakably one of the advanced models. The distain displayed by his fellow officers calling him the ultimate pejorative for a replicant, skin job. A crucial piece of exposition is provided when K confronts his target. The replicant slated for retirement is one of the last of the old Nexus models. Before returning to headquarters. He found a box containing the remains of a female replicant who died during an emergency cesarean section. Against their design specifications, replication has somehow obtained the ability to reproduce sexually. When K reports his findings to his supervisor, Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright), who is concerned that if this fact became general knowledge, it would result in a panic that would result in the war pitting humans against replicants. Joshi orders K to locate and retire the child replicant. K's first destination is the Wallace Corporation, the successor to the inventor of the technology that replicants feasible, the now-defunct Tyrell Corporation, for help in identifying the maternal replicant. Through a thorough analysis of the DNA, it is determining that the sample belonged to an advanced model replicant known as Rachael (Sean Young). She was the seductively beautiful replicant who became involved with the original old school Blade Runner, Rick Deckard. Playing into the perennial favorite plot motivation, corporate greed is naturally infused as Wallace CEO Neander Wallace (Jared Leto) wants to discover the secret to replicant reproduction placing market share, profits and technological monopoly above any concern for the safety of humanity.\n\nK has a holographic girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas), who is formed using a projector on a free moving armature mounted on the ceiling. Besides basic companionship, Joi is capable of synthesizing rather substantial insight. When K discusses seeing a date '6-10-21' carved in the trunk of a tree, he recognizes it as a childhood memory. In talking to Joi, he realizes that since replicant memories are artificial, Joi suggests he might have been born. This exploits a narrative device of plot convergence. The idea of replicant reproduction careering towards the origin story of the principal protagonist. This ignites K's curiosity motivating his search of the LAPD leading to the discovery an unusual set of twins born on that date. K's investigation has the added benefit of providing details about the process used to manufacture replications. Crucial to the process is the creation of the artificial memories, fans always knew the existed, but now the audience is introduced to Dr. Ana Stelline (Carla Juri), a designer of replicant memories. There is no sense of contrivance as this new information seamlessly infused crafting a film that is satisfying to the most diehard fan of the original.\n\nTo be fully accepted by the fans a sequel is required to receive some indication that the new installment is 'blessed' confirming its status as canon. The fan could never accept this movie if Harrison Ford were not included in the primary cast the project would have been dead on arrival. This applies in general but after returning to his signature role, Indiana Jones and Hans Solo, after a considerable amount of time. His presence validates the movie permitting it to create its narrative. Instead of immediate dismissal 'Blade Rubber 22049' is the movie fans have been anticipating for thirty-five years. The theme of the story was unencumbered these ancillary concerns. Expanding some of the psychosocial questions raised by Philip K. Dick in his novel, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' the question under consideration is among the most ancient, what does it mean to be human? The defining qualities of humanity have been pounded by religions, philosophers, and storytellers since people first gathered around a fire at night questioning the unknowable fabric of nature. This has been one of the most popular topics in science fiction often viewed through the prism of robots and later androids. With the growing concerns over the singularity, public attention has intensified. Over the intervening thirty-five years, sentient artificial beings have gone from our conjecture to the realm of possibility. This was the perfect time for this film. Pragmatically, Mr. Ford is 75 years old and plans to extend too far in the future would not be feasible. From a narrative perspective, the singularity is a hot topic, the subject of intense sustaining in the hallow halls of academia in disciplines encompassing quantum physics, computer science, and sociology. Having the replicants gain the ability to autonomously reproduce an intrinsic quality necessary to define life, at the lowest possible level.\n\nAs a bonus surprise, Edward James Olmos reprises his role as the enigmatic Gaff. Over the years Mr. Olmos has grown from a highly sought-after journeyman character to an A-List artist capable of incredibly nuanced performances. Addition of an actor of this caliber helps in providing the gravitas to the film necessary of rising to the intricacies inherent in the themes, so many sequels, particularly those overly delayed, are little more than the studio executives seeking to pad the year-end profit report. There is a literary impetus behind the creation of this movie, a genuine need to return to the story that has been with many of us for most of our adult lives. As with any worthy discussion of depth and meaning, this portion of the story raised more question than an answer. It should give the next generation something of substance to consider.",

It's honest from the start with Ryan Gosling's character; a on-the-patrol Replicant who hunts others replicants as a Blade Runner.

I was sold.\nLess than a minute into this modern masterpiece, I knew I was watching movie of the year. The futuristic cityscapes are a visionary wonderland to behold. Gosling turns in a commanding performance as a Blade Runner named K, a young detective tasked with retiring older model replicants, artificially-engineered humans created by a mega corporation. When K unearths a mystery that could send his world into chaos, he must find the legendary Blade Runner who can provide the answers.\nVilleneuve is a dexterous, provocative filmmaker who seems incapable of producing work without wow factor. This sequel of sorts deserved the box office haul The Last Jedi and Beauty and the Beast achieved but faltered as a projected cash cow. Too many made the mistake of disregarding this flick in theaters. Blade Runner: 2049 stands with Scott's original as timeless, quintessential science fiction, the kind you can't afford to miss.",

Since the original release of the book, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, this franchise has always been about identity. Denis Villenueave's 2049 digs deeper into this theme by blurring the lines between android and human. Writing aside, the cast is brilliant, with Harrison Ford stealing the show as Deckard and having great chemistry with Ryan Gosling's Agent K. However, the films greatest strength is in its visuals. Credits to cinematographer Roger Deakins, every shot of 2049 is beautiful and this continues to be true in its intense, brutal action sequences. Overall, Blade Runner 2049 pays tribute to its predecessor but also builds on the world that it created, through stunning visuals and a provocative question to think of after the film. Its 3-hour runtime can be daunting but (for the most part) the films depth and sheer energy compensate.",

            "content": "Flawless. Denis Villeneuve is a rockstar filmmaker; a visionary who makes visually sumptuous films with so much heart and humanity to them that that one can't help but to praise his talents. Sicario was a great film but Arrival was a masterpiece and Blade Runner 2049 is just as brilliant. If I had a solid screenplay written, this is the man I would want to direct my film. I am a huge fan of Aronofsky and Danny Boyle but Villeneuve is the new generation of visionary filmmaker. There is not one thing I disliked or found wrong about Arrival or BR 2049 - in my eyes they are both PERFECT films. Engrossing, beautiful, layered, meticulous, and made with so much soul that I honestly cannot understand how ANYONE could not enjoy these films. \nIn my humble opinion, I consider this sequel to Ridley Scott's classic Blade Runner to be a superior picture on nearly every level. Scott's original was a visual feast & featured terrific performances from everyone involved, particularly Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and Darryl Hannah. Here, the performances are just as powerful. Ryan Gosling is excellent in the leading role as Officer K, quiet, professionsl, duty bound but also curious and full of heart and when Ford finally appears  (long after half of the film has already played out ) he turns in another stellar performance as a weary, worn out Rick Deckard, 30 something years older but still full of fight. However, the scene stealers, the two standout performances belong  to two relatively unknown young actressss, Ana Dr Armas as Joi, Officer K's holographic girlfriend who genuinely seems capable of love, loyalty, and humanity and Sylvia Hoeks, as the ironically named Luv, a synthetic psycho killing machine custom made by Niander Wallace, an egomaniacal gazillionaire obsessed with creating the most human synthetic possible. Hoeks' performance as Luv is chilling; she is the perfect killing machine, loyal to Wallace but still independent enough to enjoy her work and to.go above and beyond her duty. She steals the show whenever she is on screen and is an excellent villain and formidable opponent to both K and Deckard.  \n\nBR  2049 can be (and is in many ways) a great standalone film  although to really appreciate it, you should be familiar with the original film, as there are tie-ins to it that you won't fully appreciate without having seen Blade Runner. In fact, the plot revolves around Deckard and Rachel (Sean Young's sexy synthetic from the first film who is not in this one, although old imagery of her is used to great effecf) and a child that they may or may not have had. Gosling'a obedient and result oriented K is tasked with finding this possible child and so is Wallace's ruthless, cold and methodical soldier Luv (a female variation of Michael Fassbenders's psychotic synthetic David from Ridley Scott's Prometheus & Alien Covenant films). And Ford's aging Deckard is caught in the middle of this battle.\n\nBR 2049 is a very long, meticulously paced film, at least one full hour longer than the original. Die hard fans of Blade Runner may cry foul and complain about the plot of this entry and it's epic pacing but I, for one thought if was a brilliantly conceived idea; not simply a rehash of the original but something fresh and intelligent. Yes, it is long (very near the 3 hour mark) but I didn't mind and never once was I bored and not once did I think to myself \"wow, what a long movie\" I was spellbound and so intrigued by the film that I wouldn't have cared if it had went on for another hour. This is entertainment of the highest calibur. Visually masterful, unbelievably vivid, solidly paced, with moments of stunning beauty interspersed with moments of sudden brutal violence. More than all of thar, it is thought provoking; an intriguing parable of what it means to be human. What is worth living, fighting, and dying for.  What it means to have a purpose, human or otherwise. K has to figure this out for himself; and he does in the end, after a nail biting climactic showdown. \n\nI can't say much more about this masterpiece, you must see it to understand  how very great it is. If you're looking for a straight up rehash sequel to the original film then I'm sorry to report that you will be disappointed. This is a sequel that stands alone and needs to be  judged on its own merits. I found it to be a flawless gem and absolutely one of the best films of 2017, if not thee best, along with the surprisingly superb Get Out. A rare Perfect 10.",

Not only was is beautiful to look at, but the broader questions about what makes us human are still used in film today. We didn't need a sequel. No one wanted a sequel. The original, despite its influence, had only ever reached cult status, and indeed wasn't anywhere near a commercial success. There was no real evidence to suggest that a second installment would be financially successful, either.  Blade Runner 2049, really shouldn't have been made, but Denis Villeneuve demanded to tackle the task because he didn't \"want anyone else to fuck it up\". Somehow he made an epic visual masterpiece that not only gave reverence to its predecessor but also stands on its own and builds on the mythology created before it. It addresses all of the questions, but without ever answering them, because to have the answers would cheapen the experience for both films. The movie also works as a self-contained story. Having seen the original will inform you a bit about the characters, but it isn't necessary. It also lays the foundation for a continuation, as badly as I want to spend more time in this world, I would also be happy if they quit while ahead. Surely lightning can't be bottled a third time.",

Fortunately, smarter judgment prevailed and director Dennis Villeneuve--Sicario, Arrival, Prisoners-- was brought on bard to extend the replicant saga. Fittingly, the film is a luscious, lovingly detailed and poetically blurred vision of a polluted and decimated Los Angeles and western United States, and the enticing and confounding issues that arise from the creation of very human like androids to essentially function and exist as nothing other than a disposable slave class remain with us. The smart matter here is that the right story elements are drawn from the original film,the right characters are brought back to furnish       us with ideas as to how matters have changed over thirty years , the mysteries have deepened more so , and the mysteries remain. BR 2049 has all the issues the lured us in from the original motion picture, but it is its  own majestic,dystopian saga.

            "content": "'Blade Runner 2049' is a movie that, at least for me, has been extremely anticipated for a very long time. The original 'Blade Runner' is one of my favorite sci-fi films of all-time, so when I heard that Ryan Gosling, one of my favorite actors, would be introduced into this universe, I was incredibly excited to see this. So when I finally got to see this movie, I left the theater with a new appreciation for what modern sci-fi can bring to cinema. This movie is incredible. I mean... where do I begin. The cinematography is the best I have seen in recent years, the acting from Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford and Sylvia Hoeks is impeccable, the story itself is consistantly mind-blowing and emotionally satisfying and the ending is beyond perfect. While the pacing in this movie could be an issue for common movie-goers, I found these \"slower\" moments in the film to be completely made up for by the eye-pleasing cinematography executed perfectly by, the great, Roger Deakins. This return to such a beautiful, sleek yet somber world is beyond welcomed for me and many others, and the people behind the camera who worked on this movie knew exactly how to portray the futuristic version of Los Angeles.\nDenis Villeneuve does amazing at directing this film. So many times we ask ourselves nowadays \"Where are the new greats? Where is the next Kubrick? Where is the next Scorsese? Where is the next Tarantino? Well... I think we have found our answer. Except for Christopher Nolan, I believe Villeneuve is the next great. With films like 'Incendies', 'Enemy', 'Prisoners', 'Sicario', 'Arrival' and now 'Blade Runner 2049', this guy has yet to disappoint.\nRyan Gosling is probably my favorite actor working in Hollywood right now. He consistently chooses to be in movies that have a true meaning. With every film he is in, he is trying to have the audience walk away with something that they did not start watching the movie with. Sure, he's been in some duds, but when his acting hits, it hits hard, and he is usually my favorite part of every film he is in. His ability to disappear behind a role is unreal and truly inspiring to me.\nHarrison Ford. Boy, does he bring it in this film. I was worried walking in that he would possibly sleep-walk his way through this film, but to my pleasant surprise, this is his strongest performance in the last decade. His is so good as Deckard, and he is always proving to me why he is one of my favorite actors of all-time.\nSylvia Hoeks is an actress I had no knowledge of prior to this film. When I first saw her on screen I was intrigued, but also unsettled. Her performance in this film is scary, yet mesmerizing to watch. Her character is conflicted, but knows what she has to do. Her role as the villain of this film is great. To me she is unknown, and she holds her own with great actors such as Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford and Jared Leto.\nThis film has a mystery that kept me engaged for it's entire 2 hours and 45 minute run-time. I can't suggest this movie enough. If you are a 'Blade Runner' fan, you will adore this film, and even if you are a casual fan of movies in general, I am confident will have a good time watching this story unfold. 'Blade Runner 2049' was one of my favorite films of 2017.",

This new version certainly isn't going to be as seminal or as divisive, nor will it create such a strong fanbase. However, it is to be enjoyed as what it tries to be: a well-crafted blockbuster with a unshakable ideological stand-point. Apart from plot or ideology, nonetheless, the prodigious directing of Villeneuve proves once again that he is one of the best working in the film industry today. Despite never reaching the heights of Arrival, this movie (which is not a film noir) is compelling to its core and every shot feels right at home. Contrary to many Hollywood directors, Villeneuve isn't afraid to keep some shots longer than they're expected and to compose them in an innovative way. He manages to imprint into the movie an overall sense of eeriness caused by its vastness, the off always feeling far greater than what you're watching. I would say that the only thing working against his vision is Walker's editing and some lack of character development in most of the characters. But even if it can be said that the shots are too short, the same can't be said about each scene as each one of them has room to breathe and has a narrative pay off. It's such a long movie that never gets to be cyclical or dull, as every integrant part of the movie is working together as whole to be captivating. Furthermore, the casting is fitting, especially Gosling who is balanced and grounded in that dystopian world.  However, every single element of the film is outshined by the most revolutionary and stunning cinematography of the year. You really don't expect that every single shot in a blockbuster will showcase such an amount of detail and care for visual storytelling. Even if you dislike the movie as whole, you have to appreciate the visual wonder it displays, as the color palette is crafted to a point in which it fits each scene's necessities, despite its variable content.I would say that it can be considered as one of Villeneuve's worse but it speaks volumes that it is still incredibly solid. It's a film that gets you hooked by its plot, but makes you stay for continuous technical and creative achievement. It will certainly be rewatched time and time again, and will serve as an example of a sequel done extremely right.",

My only two complaints are that it's about 40 minutes too long and it bogs down at times. I paused the DVD at least 6 times as I went to the kitchen for beer or snacks. I am not a big Ryan Gosling fan, but he did a good job in this moviel.",

Gosling was questionable before seeing this, but like always he became Officer K and the audience became exposed to the true emotional stress and disorder throughout the film. The references to the 1960s were valuable, but in general, the mass amount of detail that went into this film made it seem a lot more believable. I had never seen a movie from Villeneuve, but after this one, I should rethink it! Another key component to this film was the scenery, as there were so many creative and unimaginable setting included with the impressive acting. The script was a masterpiece and the effects even more. I have seen this film now over 4 times and counting, as it's easily one of the most de watchable films of the 21st century.",

The world of the original Blade Runner was dark, greedy and full of philosophical questions and 2049 manages to not only preserve the previous film, but expand on its predecessor. What a surprise it was to see Harrison Ford not as a cameo but a real character. Just how much of the modern films ever do that? The original film was quite slow-paced and sometimes boring to watch, but the world it showed, the questions it raised kept many fans going. And now we get this, a slightly modernized version of Ridley Scott's masterpiece. But it was modernized in a very careful way, trying to save as much of the setting as they possibly could, while improving what they couldn't. Blade Runner 2049 is still a slow film, unfolding its detective story in such a way that you can't even predict what is going to happen next. It leaves you at the edge of the seat at every plot twist you encounter. The world became even darker and harsher and the protagonist is almost always has to overcome difficulties, that he can't even grasp. All in all, Blade Runner 2049 is full of solid performance from the actors, gorgeous visuals, great camera work and atmosphere.",

The original film left such a legacy because it explored Philip K. Dick's original story without sacrificing storyline or characters to popular trend mechanics. It was a simple enough tale, with few key characters and action sequences used sparingly but exceptionally. 'BLADE RUNNER 2049' not only keeps up with its predecessor, it brilliantly expands on its overall importance as a pillar of science fiction cinema. Perhaps no other actor currently in Hollywood could have fit the role of Officer K more perfectly than Ryan Gosling. His complex character rhymes with Harrison Ford's iconic Deckard to deliver pure, unmatched chemistry. Robin Wright is fantastic, Jared Leto is terrifying, and Ana de Armas delivers one of the greatest performances of the year as the film's greatest centerpiece. The cinematography, exquisitely crafted and blended by Roger Deakins, is unparalleled -- some of the most beautiful moments of filmmaking I've ever seen are proposed throughout the film's unraveling, creating a marvel of cinematic imagery that is overwhelmingly powerful. There is not much that I can come up with with regards to negative components of this film; Everything seems to work perfectly, due to Denis Villenueve's unbelievable work behind the camera and precision as an auteur director. He proves himself to be more than capable of adapting the world of Blade Runner into a sequel, something that could have gone horribly wrong in so many ways and yet surpasses all shadows of a doubt and delivers an unquestionable work of modern art. This is a glimpse into the possibilities of filmmaking that could be explored by so many talented actors, directors, writers and producers within Hollywood, but is so rarely captured as magnificently. I could not award this film anything less than a perfect score. It will remain one of my favorite films forever.",

One thing's for sure, there can be no doubt that it's a well-acted and visually stunning affair, with gorgeous cinematography that captures a beautifully built world, rich in details to marvel at. Add to that the superb directing from Villeneuve (bonus film-nerd points for K's introduction which is almost an exact, frame-by-frame replica of Scott's original idea of how to introduce Deckard) who manages to coax the absolute most out of what's available, creating an incredibly immersive atmosphere and leaving you with a subtle and affecting exploration of what it means to be human, interspersed with some heavy action sequences. It's a very different film from its predecessor (yet it still manages to feel like it's part of the same universe created by Scott all those years ago) and whether or not the slower pace, philosophical focus and contemplative tone appeals to you will be a matter of taste. Personally, I loved it and it not being quite as well-rounded as it could have been just means that it's slightly off from being perfect.

It's a shame that was the end of the love affair with this movie.\nI felt no connection with K. No sympathy for the overplayed skinjob hate from his fellow officers. The only emotion the film managed to wring from me was when Joi's transportable Emanator was crushed. I had more connection to a holographic companion than any of the film's characters. Even Deckard had lost his charm.\nThe story seemed to go nowhere very slowly through a very beautifully crafted world. The plot was predictable and sedentary, and held none of the vagary that invited the speculation of the original.\nI think the movie was made to make money before telling a Blade Runner story.",

He just talks and talks.\n- Leto is your standard take over the world bad guy. \n- It's maybe 15 to 30 minutes too long.\n- A lot of long scenes that could be trimmed down.\n\nIt improves upon the original in every single way and it's one of the greatest sequels ever made. But, it's really two movies. An A.I. cop hunting down A.I. beings, and also his love relationship with another A.I. The first story is good but the relationship story is even better and should not be overlooked as a side story. \n\nThe movie made me sad at the death of Joi, which is great film-making considering she's not real. Or was she? Asking if Joi was real is kind of irrelevant though. If A.I. can satisfy emotional needs and mimic human behavior, then how is A.I. any different than a person? Because she's not real? \n\nWhat is real? What is real enough for you? And does it matter? And would you even care? \n\nI mean, aren't people already in love with their technology? No one can live without their phones. You carry the phone around with you wherever you go, constantly interact with it, and the phone literally sleeps in the bed next to you. Humans preferring the company of technology rather than other humans. We're living in that world now. It's already here. Imagine what is next to come.",

Ryan Gosling gives an extraordinary performance, as well as Harrison Ford, who also starred in the very first Blade Runner. But the best aspect of this flick is, by far, the eye-popping, amazing special effects and what's even more extraordinary is that the movie makes them look so normal, so simple. There basically isn't a scene without special effects. A masterpiece and I call it the best sequel of 2017 for sure. Recommended !!",

I loved every second of this movie, and cannot seem to find one thing critically wrong with it. Usually the more I think about a movie, or watch one that I notice things I don't like, and I've thought about Blade Runner 2049 for a solid week now. It's perfect. Director Denis Villeneuve, along with this film and his other masterpieces, has sealed himself as one of the best directors of all time, and this film is the best reason why.\n\nThe original film (a review for that will come later) is also a science fiction masterpiece, and one that people didn't think needed a sequel. It was so simplistic, yet so beautiful, and one wouldn't think that anything could be added on to it. But we got a film with the most engrossing, beautiful, and naturally evolving story lines I've ever seen. You just have to see it to believe it, and know how carefully crafted this film really is. It starts so simple but unravels itself to you so brilliantly, that it seems like everything is happening in real time. I know that's the point of a plot to unravel itself, but so many movies nowadays are so predictable, especially sequels.\n\nThe cinematography is gorgeous. Roger Deakins almost always does the cinematography for Denis Villeneuve films, and he has this subtle beauty to every single one of his shots and it makes them all so uniquely profound. Simply put, the film is shot perfectly.\n\nThe acting is great all around. Gosling fits into this world very well, and Harrison Ford reprises his role exactly how you'd imagine he would. I was hoping he wasn't just going to be old, tired Harrison Ford, but he was honestly better in this movie than he was in The Force Awakens. The girl who played \"Joi\" was phenomenal, and this is easily her best role.\n\nThere's not much else to say but go see this masterpiece, and watch the Final Cut of Blade Runner before you do. The themes expanded upon in this film of love and fear are so beautiful, and are done better than any other movie I've ever seen. Needless to say, it's one of the greatest movies of all time. 11 out of 10",

The effects were great, as was the atmosphere, cinematography and the sheer aesthetic brilliance of the dystopia being presented. When I watched Blade Runner 2049, longer than its predecessor, I found all these pros to still be intact, but what made the original such a tough sit were also true for the belated sequel. Denis Villeneuve is an excellent director who has proven himself capable of handling thinking-persons Sci-fi with Arrival. But here, in his attempts to establish a dark, brooding atmosphere, he allows shots to go on for an obscene length of time. Add to that the long pauses in conversations, the scenes of people doing nothing but staring and the interminable shots of people walking or flying ships, and you have a film which is roughly an hour longer than it needs to be. Jared Leto, a brilliant actor given prominent billing and a good chunk of the poster, is given almost nothing to do besides wander around spouting vague, Godly diatribes that contribute nothing to the story. His entire role could have been cut out and nothing would be sacrificed. Likewise, Harrison Ford is supposed to be a heavy supporting player, but gets little screen time and is rarely, if ever, the focus. I admire what the film tries to do and how it's put together, but everything takes too long to be said, if it even needs to be said at all, and scenes prattle on and on, at best without haste and at worst without purpose. Unless some heavy trimming was done, I won't be watching it again anytime soon.",

The first movie was a rather dark one after all and this one is a truly post-apocalyptic one. I quite liked the first movie despite its dark setting though. However this one takes the darkness and melancholy to an entirely new level.\n\nAs I said before, technically the movie is great. The scenery is stunning whether it is a dirty little hut out in the badlands or the equally dirty vast cityscapes. The scenes of the abandoned city where Decker is (re)introduced is sad but beautiful.\n\nThe acting is more or less great from all the main characters and the special effects are very well done and just right to fit with the rest of the movie.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot bring myself to give it more than 3 out of 5 stars.

Purchased the movie in 3d to match my theatre viewing experience...and on my fifth home viewing....still incredible! The speculative, marketing inspired demise of 3d in North America is undoubtedly and assuredly premature. 3d format or otherwise the movie remains a masterpiece. \n\nIt should be the Oscar pick for best movie of 2017, and the cast including Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Ana de Armas and others nominated in respective roles. Consummate actors all, not to mention Denis Villeneuve as Best Director. Thank Ridley Scott for recognizing his genius.\n\nThe reality is that Science Fiction, even as a statement on the human condition, has never won an Oscar for Best Movie, as far as I know. The Academy Awards will likely miss this, caught up in the social media swamp and the cause of the day. The Academy will likely instead vote for an odd duck or more common place take on the triumphs and tribulations of the human condition, all destined to become mediocrities and also rans for 2017. This in turn, as it continues to demonstrate, makes Oscar night nothing more than a gossips' social gathering and more redundant and meaningless than ever in what it's function should be - rewarding real achievement in film.\n\nMeanwhile like the first Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049 will continue to attract an ever growing following and challenge current and future movie makers to raise the bar on what is now possible.",

The stuff where Rick chases K through his Las Vegas home is some of my favorite stuff all year long, and 2017 was a great year for movies. Ana de Armas (Joi) was quietly the show stealer. Though she's an AI, there's a humanness to her character and you really feel for her. At first, I thought the sex scene was possibly a waste of time, but it added to her relationship with K and made what happens to her mean even more. The other small roles are all well-acted, from Robin Wright (Lt. Joshi) to Dave Bautista (Sapper Morton) to Jared Leto (Niander Wallace) and everyone in between, there are no bad performances.\n\nWeaknesses: At 163 minutes, this is one long film. It feels a bit longer because there isn't a lot of action, especially in the first half. It can be tough to maintain focus while some of the story unravels. Though I though Leto was fine in the role, I wasn't a big fan of the Wallace character. He didn't fit the antagonist role the way I hoped he would\n\nOverall: Once again, Denis Villeneuve delivers. This film took a slew of talented people (Gosling, Villeneuve, Ford, cinematographer Rodger Deakins, etc.) and gave them the platform to deliver a memorable show. It's exactly what I want from a sci-fi film. A great story, masterful visuals, and a fantastical world. One of the best films of a crowded 2017.",

The movie's pace is slow, with points of action left sparse, but the soundtrack and cinematography keep you interested. The acting is superb, including by Ryan Gosling who had a bit of a reputation going into this movie as being the guy from Magic Mike. If you're a fan of the previous Blade Runner this can be disconcerting going into the film - but Gosling proves that he's a dynamic and talented actor. Characters from the first film are brought back in the sequel, but it's done so in a natural way that doesn't feel like pandering - an issue that some returning franchises have had trouble with.

            "content": "We now find ourselves in an age where the filmmaking craft is so preoccupied with making money that it hinders the art form itself and saturates the market with crowd-pleasing dross. The rise of the superhero blockbuster has played a huge part in this and, as result, the creative and artistic  nature of Blade Runner 2049 has become a casualty. Like Ridley Scott's film before it, it has proven to be a box-office failure and despite the desire to provide sequels, the masses simply weren't interested in this one. But 2017 took the sequel to a whole new level. They weren't just money-spinning exercises but revisits to much loved cult classics that were intent on exploring their characters in a whole new depth: 20 years after the drug-addled exploits of Trainspotting, Danny Boyle brought a satisfying maturity to T2 while, 25 years later, David Lynch revisited the quaint logging town of Twin Peaks with The Return - a deeply surreal 18 episodes that has reinvented the way that television can be viewed. Going even further back than that, Denis Villenueve revisits Blade Runner after a 35 year hiatus and relieves my nervous disposition with the impressive completion of a 2017 hat-trick.\n\nPlot: Former blade runner, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) has been missing for thirty years and now LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling), has taken over the role of \"retiring\" replicants that don't conform to society. When K unearths a secret that has the catastrophic potential to plunge what\u0092s left of society into chaos, he has to find Deckard to get answers to what actually happened after he disappeared.\n\nA lot of credit must be given to director Denis Villenueve for taking on one of the biggest gambles in filmmaking history. To take on the unenviable task of delivering a sequel to the 1982 Ridley Scott classic, Blade Runner, shows real, self-assured confidence. Villenueve took the task on simply because he thought he could do a serviceable job while fans of the original (myself included) had strong reservations about a sequel even happening in the first place. As is always the case, however, the proof is in the end result and I couldn't be more happy that Villenueve has been vindicated. His vision of Blade Runner both expands upon its predecessor while also complimenting it's narrative depth and ethereal beauty. \n\nVillenueve's decision to open on a close-up shot of an iris is an obvious choice - with perhaps the only thing missing being a referential wink to the audience. Within seconds he goes on to depict an expansive, genetic farming land that's as desolate as it foreboding and already the opening \"Hades Landscape\" of the original springs to mind as Hans Zimmer creatively riffs on the iconic Vangelis score and manages that fine balance of reminiscence and originality. From here on, it's clear that we're back on Blade Runner territory and I'd be lying if I didn't say it felt good. \n\nThere are many subtle references to the original throughout the entirety of the film but Villenueve is clever enough to make this film his own without succumbing to a pastiche. His deliberate pace will ostracise many viewers but it's entirely in keeping with the films meditative themes and allows cinematographer Roger Deakins the luxury of immersing us in this dystopian, retro-future with an abundance of gorgeous imagery. There's not a single frame wasted as Deakins delivers one of the most beautiful pieces of work ever committed to the screen. This visual genius has been nominated for an Oscar 13 times and he's lost every time. If there's any justice at all, he should win on his 14th attempt with this. This truly is a remarkable artistic achievement.\n\nSuch is the visual mastery, you could be forgiven for getting lost in Deakins' sumptuous scenery and miss key elements to the plot but Villenueve, or more particularly screenwriters Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, explain things in relative layman's terms. It's not difficult to follow but sometimes can border on cliche and convenience. I didn't fully buy into some plot developments but the questions left from Deckard's past were, somewhat, unavoidable and this film provides some answers which slightly take away from the original's ambiguity. That said, it's an unavoidable line that had to be crossed and it's afforded a lot of care and respect. \n\nAlthough, the narrative is fairly simple the similar weighty existential and metaphysical themes are prevalent again. Where the first film explored the nature of existence, 2049 takes it slighter further and ruminates in what it constutes to have a soul and if you're looking for a reliable lead that can convey such world-weariness then look no further than Ryan Gosling. Gosling has fast become a physical master of minimalism and, as he has already proven in Drive or Only God Forgives for example, he can convey internal struggle by practically doing nothing - which makes him absolutely perfect casting here and apparently the first (and only) choice that Villenueve had in mind. He shoulders a lot of the philosophical weight of the film and holds things together when the pace is lesuirely and there's the overhanging (and overbearing) 1 hour 40 minute wait for Deckard to even appear onscreen. It's a wait that's worth it though, as it kicks the film into another gear and brings with it Harrison Ford's best performance in years. There's also more than able support from Ana de Armas as a complex hologram that longs for emotional connection and a megalomaniac Jared Leto with delusions of godliness. In other words, Blade Runner 2049 is a remarkable refurbishment and a genuinely astounding spectacle that manages to hit the beats of the original and still find its own rhythm. \n\nSome critics have have went as far to claim that this is an improvement over the original. Although I wouldn't go as far as that, this is still a magnificent continuation of the mythos. The only sour note is that it descends into slightly generic action material towards the end which jars with the deliberate and meditative tone that preceded it. That said, it manages to turn this around and when credits rolled, I found myself in contemplative silence, exhilarated by what I had just witnessed. Sequels that can achieve such a balance and expansion on their much loved predecessors are a rarity and, as a result, 2049 can take a bow and is fully deserving of a rapturous applause. Villenueve has only gone and made things we fans couldn't believe - a worthy sequel on the shoulders of a giant.\n\nMark Walker",

Only a few other sequels manage to do that, with examples being The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather Part II. This film is able to capture the idea of being human and make it into an engaging story. It offers questions such as, \"Does one need a soul to be human?\" \n\nIn conclusion, I find this film to be a cinematic masterpiece, topping Ridley Scott's 1982 magnum opus in every way.

So 30 years later we got our sequel. Some times waiting that long for a sequel fills me with dread. But in this case it works remarkably well. The cast all fits there roles, the returning Harrison Ford is his usual self (my wife even watched this, mainly cause of him I'm sure), Ryan Gosling is very good as K, the Blade Runner of this movie and even Jared Letho is good. The story kept my attention through out the movie and whilst it is long. Its a very deliberate piece of story telling. After sleeping on it and thinking about this movie I think a 4 star rating is completely where it is. Denis Villeneuve is fast approaching Christopher Nolan as my favorite director. His visual style is all over this movie and he depicts a time not to far in the future to be very dystopian. Under lying themes, concise story telling and great visuals all account to a great sequel which unlike other recent Alien sequels push the story in a satisfying manner.",

And somehow this genius thinks it's actually a good idea to give a slave race that's stronger than them, the ability to reproduce.

Every shot is a piece of art. The lighting, the sets, the cinematography, the art direction & directing is of the highest caliber. Perhaps the most beautiful film I have ever seen.\n\nIt truly is a Neo noir masterpiece. \n\nNow that brings us to the NEW BLADERUNNER 2049. A pale comparison to the original in every way. what a flat, uninteresting borefest of a film. Yes there are some inspired visual moments to be had but they are only here & there. The film grandly plots along as though they forgot it was meant to be viewed. \n\nSuch a talented team was assembled for this one. Villenueve seemed like the perfect choice as director following up his brilliant film Arrival. One of the greats in the cinematography world, Roger Deakins on camera and some great source material to work with.\n\nUnfortunately lots of talent does not produce the desired results in all cases. The new Bladerunner really falls short in every way. I was also disappointed in the films score which was so unique to the original film. Sure this score is inspired by and is good as a stand alone but to make the decision to almost abandon the originals score best points was another mistake in my opinion. \nOne high light here is the surprisingly good performance from Harrison Ford who's acting really shines here. I've always liked Ford as a movie star but never have I scene him display acting chops as he does here. The high light of the film.\n\nOne of the worst things I can say about a film is \"why did they bother making this\"? That is what I was saying to myself as this film about very little was winding down in the theatre.\n\nSave your money and avoid this snoozfest of a film. There is very little here to like. Pull out the original final cut version and watch it on a large display or screen and marvel at what a truly fantastic film the original is.\n\nUnfortunately this one should have never been made.

Denis Villeneuve, the director, does cajole for you to reach out for the material outside the world. And through crisp clean environment, colored magnanimously and beautifully by the production design and visual effects. I'd like to draw your attention towards the enormous set pieces staged by the amazing artists working behind it.\n\nThe world, as always, starts with infinite choice and hence ambiguous never-ending locations and as this case moves forwards and Ryan Gosling finds himself closer towards the answer; if there is any, the set pieces grows definite and within the questioned boundaries, to a degree, that in its last act, three is a crowd, is framed on the screen. These tiny aspects of this chapter, is what makes this film a better storyteller, than it has to say. For as far as the themes are concerned, there is a lot of seen-this-seen-that phases. And yet, with splendid cinematography and its iconic background score, the film nails a work on the wall that cannot be interpreted as anything but art.\n\nAs this series has shown us, the characters are often mended as some puppets and the world they revolve around, the puppeteer. And filled with incredibly expressive details, even the behavior of the characters and the change in their perception is carried out through their surroundings. Gosling enters this franchise with a calm resilient body language and comes out from the mission shook and moved by the consequences of his action. And this action is a particularly noble one, in contrast to Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard in the previous chapter. And maybe, this is what's appealing and crowd pleasing to the audience, the hope that someone as Blade Runner, could melt down.",

Is this new iteration faithful and obedient in replicating the original? Will the 2.0 version make the earlier film obsolete, or can the past uphold its legacy? And what of our memories-how will knowing this new chapter in the life cycle of Deckard (Harrison Ford) affect our remembering of his origins? Thankfully, Blade Runner 2049 is a strong addition to the universe created by filmmaker Ridley Scott and screenwriter Hampton Fancher based on a Philip K. Dick story. Deliberately paced, with a strong sense of atmosphere and compelling visuals, this is a sequel which builds upon the original foundation without ever quite surpassing it.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 is wonderfully nostalgic, evoking the unique aesthetic of the original film while crafting its own visual style and narrative structure. Cinematographer Roger \"Give him an Oscar already\" Deakins is at his finest here, working with Denis Villeneueve to create awe-inspiring, spectacular images within the frame. The score from Hans \"Make It Louder\" Zimmer and Ben Wallfisch draw upon the technological hums and drones of the original Vangelis score while adding a bit more of a sinister tone underneath the enormous \"WHOMMMMM\" sounds shaking the theater seats. The environments of the futuristic Los Angeles have a lived-in feel to them which is right in step with the original film's dark-and-grim aesthetic. Some sequels or prequels, such as Blade Runner 2049 producer Ridley Scott's Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, suffer from technological amnesia, where the technology within the film reflects the era of the film's production more than the world within the film itself (e.g. How come the spaceships in Prometheus are more technologically advanced than those in Alien?). Blade Runner 2049 wisely keeps with the Atari- and Russian-filled details of its predecessor while adding a few key technological upgrades, such as hovering drones and hologram A.I.\n\nThis attention to technological detail is present within the very plot structure, as the opening scrawl of Blade Runner 2049 reveals that the world has recovered after a technological blackout, allowing for the creation of new obedient replicants and the need to hunt down and \"retire\" any older versions. The film centers on LAPD officer \"K\" (Ryan Gosling) in his film noir-like search for answers to the questions he's having about the nature of replicants. Gosling's performance is wonderfully muted and winsome, but it's Harrison Ford's moments as the older, grizzled Deckard which I found most affecting. It's one of Ford's strongest performances in years, at least since 2010's Morning Glory. The way he carries himself, the few scenes which allow him to really emote-he's softened over the past 30 years, and that's a good thing. The snarky, stoic Deckard from 1982/2019 has matured into someone who can hold his own in a fight while being honed and refined by the passing of time.\n\nThe biblical allusions in Blade Runner 2049 are quite overt, with strong parallels to the Genesis story of Rachel and her son Joseph. There's an oppressed group desiring freedom from their captivity, and a twisted creator/captor (Jared Leto) who makes a repeated reference to the replicants as \"angels\" in their human-like nature. These scriptural notions underpin the film's philosophical questions: What does it mean to be alive? What is the nature of a soul, of the material body? How does technology affect our ethics, our sense of existence, and our need for community? Do our memories make up our identity, and if so, what happens if those memories are altered or lost? What does it mean to be real? I was reminded of a plethora of sci-fi films, ranging from the more recent (Her, Ex Machina) to those of decades past (A.I., Metropolis), and I think that's in the film's favor. It's not aping the original Blade Runner film, nor is it copying previous sci-fi efforts (although one intimate scene does feel a bit too much like a moment from Her). Instead, Blade Runner 2049 joins the ranks of excellent big-budget sci-fi films in its world-building and prophetic capabilities. The best sci-fi doesn't just make us think about the future; it's a mirror for the present, provoking us to consider our situation and our souls. Though no moment outshines the iconic \"tears in rain\" scene with Rutger Hauer, there are glimpses of brilliance and wonder to behold.",

No movie released in 2017 could hold a candle to BR2049's atmospheric delights.\n\nThe bad news: It's uninteresting. Boring, even. Blade Runner The Elder worked so well because it was a cramped, personal meditation on the nature of being human, and/or just being. Very small people wrestled with very big questions in very tight spaces, surrounded by very large, very distant corporations, isolating the characters to stew in their own existence. \n\nBR2049, by contrast, is a grandiose confection. It's pretty and sweet and empty. Many of the themes and devices in Blade Runner The Elder have been stripped of their potency by advanced technology or just lazy writing. No need to mess the the audience's head about who is or isn't human; just look up and to the left. No need to puzzle out dilemmas or meanings, the movie just tells you, its characters functioning as conduits, spelling out every theme without the need for thought. Yawn.\n\nPerhaps that's why, despite ample screentime given over to humanizing Ryan Gosling's K, you just don't care about him or his problems. He's not a person, he's a device, and if that's the point, it's less an artistic achievement and more a meta commentary on lazy filmmaking. Yes, it's beautiful, and that took a lot of hard work, but it was obviously meant to be a spiritual successor to The Elder, and as such, is lazy. Unpacking The Elder was the work of much consideration. There is no need to unpack BR2049; it's already unpacked and then slapped across your face repeatedly. \n\nThe question I kept asking myself was, \"Who is this movie for?\" Fans of the original? Doesn't seem likely. New-to-the-franchise (a 3rd movie is already being discussed) viewers? This is hardly the place to begin. People who just want entertainment? Highly unlikely. No, the answer I kept coming back to was the filmmakers themselves. Not in a face-only-a-mother-could-love kind of way, but in a we-made-something-beautiful kind of way. In an awards show kind of way. Because if BR2049 doesn't sweep every technical award, I'll be pretty surprised.\n\nIt's just not a particularly good *film*.",

Thanks to bringing back original screenwriter Hampton Fancher who I imagine has been thinking about more Blade Runner for 35 years, and director Denis Villeneuve who, based on the clear reverence on display in this sequel, may have been thinking about Blade Runner for nearly as long, 2049 mines the themes/images/ideas of the original in unexpected but perfectly organic and satisfying ways. It is not much of stretch to say that 2049 is a much more mature and deeper film than the original. In the 35 years since the original, the question of what makes a human has been asked and answered, analyzed and re-asked. Technology has altered the question as humanity gets closer to the reality of artificial intelligence, so this film has to be deeper on an intellectual level but it is also just a better made film.",

            "content": "Not to make a big deal of it, but just as a heads-up I am not big into the filmography of Denis Villeneuve; I always admire his craftsmanship and vision in his films, but the only one I have actually been satisfied by is \"Sicario.\" That should give one a good indication of the low expectations in which I was imagining a \"Blade Runner\" sequel helmed by him would be. Already \"Runner\" is a great film, yet one that I don't really feel I need to return to that often, and certainly not as liked by me (for Ridley Scott movies) as \"Alien,\" so there's that strike against it. Well, Villeneuve rose against the tide and concocted a masterstroke of motion-picture goodness.  He and screenwriters Hampton Fancher and Michael Green were able to take the basic ideas and template of the epic 1983 original and embellish the lore and universe of that predecessor, and they do it successfully without disregarding the source material or pushing it too far in an unfortunate direction (looking at you, unneeded sequels \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" and \"Jason Bourne\"). Like the first \"Blade Runner,\" it poses such wonderful questions of our existence, but this one engaged my attention in an even-deeper way. The lead performances are excellent, with Harrison Ford reprising his role of Deckard with relative ease (adding subtle layers to the character's progression) and Ryan Gosling actually inhabiting a character this time around. Normally I find him stuck in two modes with his acting: his version of \"charismatic\" that comes off as artificial (as seen paired with Emma Stone in \"La La Land,\" \"Gangster Squad,\" or \"Crazy, Stupid Love\"), and portraying stoicism which could be read by viewers as cold or wooden (i.e. any of his more-serious roles, such as in \"The Ides of March\"); here, he sidesteps those extremes to play a driven, yet emotionally-complicated, cop of the future.  Even Jared Leto, whose thematic talents are usually too over-the-top for my taste, is relatively toned-down here. Yeah, there are a few scenes here and there that I concur with the critical consensus where five to ten minutes of screentime could be cut (especially in the second act, where at least a half-hour could be trimmed); however, for the most part the pacing did not bother me to the extent that it did in the first \"Blade Runner\"'s opening. I did have a little more of a personal issue with some of the nudity in the flick, though. I know it comes down to personal taste, and one of the sex scenes in the movie is artfully done, but a couple of the later moments (featuring a supporting actress in the computer-avatar, but non-android role of the cast) seemed to me to have less of a sub-textual point than simple titillation and simply unnecessary. That said, otherwise this film is definitely the best I have seen in 2017.",

Es el titulo original de aquella novela que inspirar\u00eda la creaci\u00f3n del hoy cl\u00e1sico de culto BLADE RUNNER, la joya de la corona del cine de ciencia ficci\u00f3n, estrenada en 1982, fue dirigida por Ridley Scott, protagonizada por Harrison Ford, la m\u00fasica y ambientaci\u00f3n sonora compuesta por el gran Vangelis y supervisada meticulosamente en la creaci\u00f3n visual por el mismo Phillip K Dick hasta el d\u00eda de su muerte unos meses antes del estreno. Fue un filme muy arriesgado desde su concepci\u00f3n, el mundo no estaba listo para conocerla y tristemente tambi\u00e9n fue un fracaso de taquilla, marginada injustamente de los grandes reflectores, galas y premiaciones. Fue hasta una d\u00e9cada despu\u00e9s que la pel\u00edcula tom\u00f3 fuerza, llegando al gusto de la gente, convirti\u00e9ndola en lo que es hoy, un cl\u00e1sico de culto.\n\nPara hablar de BLADE RUNNER 2049 debemos hablar de antecedentes, de sus creadores, de su concepci\u00f3n y hasta de la campa\u00f1a que han elaborado para promover la pel\u00edcula, se prepararon 3 cortos que fueron presentados en meses pasados a la par de los trailers de la pel\u00edcula, esos cortos nos relataban parte de los hechos ocurridos entre 2019 al finalizar la primer pel\u00edcula de Blade Runner y el 2049. Estos cortos cinematogr\u00e1ficos dirigidos por Luke Scott y Shinichiro Watanabe presentaron varios de los nuevos personajes que aparecer\u00edan en la pel\u00edcula, as\u00ed como un acontecimiento sumamente importante situado en el a\u00f1o 2022 llamado BLACKOUT, un apag\u00f3n masivo donde la informaci\u00f3n albergada en ordenadores seria borrada por un grupo de replicantes rebeldes que buscaban as\u00ed eliminar los registros de poblaci\u00f3n mundial y de esa manera poder pasar desapercibidos ante el mundo, como un ser humano m\u00e1s.\n\nDescubr\u00ed Blade Runner hace 7 a\u00f1os, y para m\u00ed fue como conocer el amor de mi vida, fue como escuchar m\u00fasica por primera vez, fue descubrir que en el cine hay mucho m\u00e1s que historias y entretenimiento, fue descubrir un tesoro intacto del pasado, un momento congelado en el tiempo brillando para mi entre la oscuridad del mundo actual. Una obra magnifica y superior, la joya m\u00e1s bella de la Ciencia Ficci\u00f3n, p\u00e1lida, fr\u00eda y llena de todo eso que inspira al ser humano a crear, amar y vivir. 1982 fue el a\u00f1o de su creaci\u00f3n y hoy 35 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s nos presentan BLADE RUNNER 2049. Hay personas que esperaron 35 a\u00f1os para poder ver una secuela, hay otros que desearon que jam\u00e1s ocurriera y es comprensible, tenemos varios ejemplos de c\u00f3mo echar a la basura una saga maravillosa, \u00bfverdad TERMINATOR? \u00bfCierto Jar Jar Binks? Blade Runner fue catalogada como la pel\u00edcula m\u00e1s atesorada por su base de fans, la mayor\u00eda temiendo una posible secuela en estos tiempos de los Michael Bay y los James Wan.\n\nTeniendo apenas 7 a\u00f1os de conocer el mundo de los replicantes sent\u00ed como si 35 a\u00f1os hubiesen pasado, pues desde que en 2013 fue divulgada la noticia de una secuela en producci\u00f3n, infinitas dudas y emociones indescriptibles pasaron por mi cabeza, ansiedad, que fue tranquilizada hasta saber que RIDLEY SCOTT producir\u00eda la pel\u00edcula y que el magn\u00edfico Denis Villeneuve dirigir\u00eda el filme, las notas acerca del rodaje fueron creciendo en la red, tendr\u00edamos a Hampton Fancher el mismo Guionista de 1982, Harrison Ford regresaba a interpretar a Rick Deckard y recientemente apenas unos meses atr\u00e1s Hans Zimmer se un\u00eda al equipo para en tan solo 8 semanas componer la banda sonora. \n\nPocas cosas en mi vida he esperado tanto como el estreno de BLADE RUNNER 2049, la \u00faltima vez que espere algo as\u00ed fue una total decepci\u00f3n all\u00e1 por el 2003 con TERMINATOR 3 y Shakira de hojalata, vaya basura nos hicieron tragar. Es entonces de entender que mi mente estuviera llena de ansiedad, de posibles teor\u00edas, de miedos e inclusive pesadillas, algo parecido a lo que todos vivimos con STAR WARS y sus nuevos estrenos pero mucho m\u00e1s profundo, pues aunque nos emocionemos, lloremos y gocemos con la saga de George Lucas, en el fondo sabemos que el bien siempre triunfar\u00e1 y que existe un plan dentro de toda la trama que al final nos llevara a un momento celestial donde todo se resolver\u00e1, pero en el mundo de Blade Runner no es as\u00ed, este mundo es oscuro, desolador, cruel y muy inversivo. Este tipo de pasi\u00f3n es el que despierta BLADE RUNNER en sus fan\u00e1ticos, este universo de melancol\u00eda futurista comparte ese distintivo que separa opiniones, BLADE RUNNER puedes amarla u olvidarla, pero jam\u00e1s hay medias tintas con este drama de cuestionamientos filos\u00f3ficos y morales en un mundo CYBEPUNK. \n\nEl an\u00e1lisis\n \nApenas comienza BLADE RUNNER 2049, y su poes\u00eda visual comienza a acariciarte, las tomas a\u00e9reas y los planos son impresionantes, llenas de tonos frios y encuadres perfectos, hay que mencionar que todos y cada uno de los sets, calles, edificios, automoviles y todo lo que aparece en la pel\u00edcula fue construido por la producci\u00f3n, no hay nada sint\u00e9tico, el CGI que se utiliza es muy poco, limpio y funciona a favor de contarnos la pel\u00edcula, estamos saboreando apenas las im\u00e1genes cuando la banda sonora aparece, esa m\u00fasica profunda con melod\u00edas de una tenue melancol\u00eda que te trasportan al futuro decadente de Los Angeles 2049, sus motivos sonoros son suaves, casi atmosf\u00e9ricos, flotan en la sala de proyecci\u00f3n cuando hace su aparici\u00f3n Ryan Glosling. Una de las terribles dudas que todos ten\u00edamos, \u00bfel joven so\u00f1ador de La La Land puede ser un Blade Runner? \u00bfTiene los tama\u00f1os actorales para evolucionar desde aquel gal\u00e1n de THE NOTEBOOK a un temerario cazador de androides? Y la respuesta es SI, la primer secuencia de la pel\u00edcula es tan hermosa como violenta y nos arroja el primer balde de agua fr\u00eda, el primer cuestionamiento moral, la primer tortura al alma y el primer discurso filos\u00f3fico.\n \nNo voy a entrar en detalles sobre la trama de la pel\u00edcula, odio los spoilers y respeto mucho la experiencia ajena, voy a limitarme a mencionar aspectos globales de la pel\u00edcula. Comenzando por las actuaciones, en verdad son acertadas, muy art\u00edsticas y ricas en emociones proyectadas, desde los momentos melanc\u00f3licos y sombr\u00edos hasta los pasajes en\u00e9rgicos y violentos, estoy impresionado con Dave Batista y su personaje y sin hurgar mucho en detalles que se presten a conjeturas y spoilers, todos los actores hicieron un trabajo memorable. La fotograf\u00eda es hermosa, es un factor fundamental en el universo de BLADE RUNNER pues en una realidad futurista y podrida no todo se dice con palabras y es esencial para la narrativa del filme la manera en la que ROGER DAKINS nos muestra ese mundo, su fotograf\u00eda es bell\u00edsima y totalmente superior a cualquier obra de 2017. \n\nEl guion es fabuloso, nos muestra situaciones que se van solucionando y dando paso a otras m\u00e1s grandes, poco a poco te va metiendo dentro del conflicto principal atando senderos narrativos y conectando ambas pel\u00edculas, no es un guion predecible y te mantendr\u00e1 atado a tu asiento durante sus 2 horas 43 minutos de acci\u00f3n, di\u00e1logos profundos, flashbacks, toneladas de futurismo y violencia para adultos.\n\nHay solo dos cosas que podr\u00edan ser cuestionables dentro de la pel\u00edcula, la primera es la participaci\u00f3n de Harrison Ford ya muy entrado en a\u00f1os en una pel\u00edcula que exige acci\u00f3n e intensidad y la otra es la ausencia del maestro VANGELIS en la banda sonora, creador del universo sonoro del primer filme. Sin embargo, ambas cuestiones se han resuelto bien, d\u00e1ndole a Harrison Ford un rol coherente, mostr\u00e1ndonos su evoluci\u00f3n como Persona o Replicante ( TU DECIDE ) pero respetando la esencia sombr\u00eda y mal encarada de Rick Deckard, sin embargo no puedo dejar de pensar que quiz\u00e1s la pel\u00edcula tambi\u00e9n habr\u00eda funcionado sin \u00e9l y que incluso antes de su aparici\u00f3n en la trama todo se siente muy eficaz. \n\nEn la banda sonora han hecho una excelente decisi\u00f3n, HANS ZIMMER y su coescritor Benjam\u00edn Wallfisch han creado un muro de hermosas melod\u00edas, melanc\u00f3licos pasajes y motivos estridentes, la utilizaci\u00f3n de sintetizadores antiguos y la mezcla con los nuevos sintetizadores han resultado en una obra sonora de gran belleza que se muestra con un alma autentica sin querer copiar o parodiar a VANGELIS, nadie jam\u00e1s podr\u00e1 igualar lo que el compositor Griego hizo en 1982 pero Hans Zimmer le ha dado nueva vida a BLADE RUNNER de una forma m\u00e1s que digna.\n\nEl dise\u00f1o de producci\u00f3n, el vestuario, maquillaje e iluminaci\u00f3n est\u00e1n tan bien hechos que de pronto olvidas que est\u00e1s viendo una pel\u00edcula, es una experiencia inmersiva, totalmente fant\u00e1stica, es como estar en un sue\u00f1o hermoso donde el peligro latente del pasado y los propios monstros de la humanidad acechan en esas calles de muros de altos, esa vida de NEON, plagada de hologramas, vapores t\u00f3xicos y lluvia eterna. He escuchado personas decir, que la pel\u00edcula es muy larga, que es aburrida, que no pasa nada... Yo te puedo decir, que no es una pel\u00edcula sacada de un molde, no es una historia para pasar el tiempo, no es cine para hacerte re\u00edr o para mostrarte cuerpos hermosos ni autos de carrera corriendo por la Ant\u00e1rtida, no vas a ver ROBOTS rapeando o planetas explotar. \n\nBLADE RUNNER 2049 te muestra en la cara, el futuro probable de la humanidad, nos trae frente al cad\u00e1ver de nuestra civilizaci\u00f3n, nos muestra parte de los laberintos m\u00e1s oscuros de nuestra conciencia y probablemente estemos viviendo ahora el inicio de ese futuro decadente, no vas a salir de la sala pensando que Anna de Armas es hermosa, no, no vas a salir con ganas de ser un BLADE RUNNER, es una pel\u00edcula que taladra en el alma y el coraz\u00f3n del espectador, que te va a hacer preguntarte por el resto de tu vida \u00bfCu\u00e1l es el significado de estar vivo? \u00bfEstas vivo? \u00bfQui\u00e9n merece vivir? \u00bfD\u00f3nde termina la realidad y comienza lo sint\u00e9tico? \u00bfSomos quienes creemos ser? Y finalmente \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que nos hace humanos? Blade Runner 2049 es la muestra de que es posible hacer una secuela a la altura de un cl\u00e1sico, es la prueba final de que aun hoy en esta realidad tan pobre existe gente dispuesta a hacer arte y al mismo tiempo tratar de hacernos recapacitar sobre nuestra estad\u00eda en la vida, es una pel\u00edcula que te recuerda tu propia insignificancia, es hermosa, es una obra que toca los sentidos y los rincones del ser humano, tristemente repetir\u00e1 el mismo destino que su antecesora de 1982 y tendr\u00e1 un modesto desempe\u00f1o en la taquilla, demostr\u00e1ndonos que Blade Runner desgraciadamente no es cine para todos y que es un filme que disfrutan las minor\u00edas, aun as\u00ed estoy seguro que en los premios Oscar tendr\u00e1 una fuerte participaci\u00f3n y desde ahora me atrevo a decir que Fotograf\u00eda, Sonido, efectos especiales y Montaje los tiene en la bolsa, y que adem\u00e1s luchar\u00e1 por mejor director, mejor pel\u00edcula, mejor guion adaptado, mejor banda sonora, mejor vestuario y probablemente mejor actor.\n\nEs una pel\u00edcula de calificaci\u00f3n 9.9\nHan pasado 3 d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de verla y aun hoy me siento perturbado, me encant\u00f3, creo que junto a Terminator 2, Back To The Future 2 y Empire Strikes Back las mejores secuelas de la historia, es una obra magistral y superior,  una joya moderna de la Ciencia Ficci\u00f3n, pero tambi\u00e9n toca sin cuidado dentro de ti, te arranca el coraz\u00f3n y te deja en un limbo mental, donde no sabes si te pertenece un alma, un n\u00famero de serie o caracteres en un ordenador, donde divagas pensando \u00bfqu\u00e9 tanto de ti es real y que tanto de ti no te pertenece', BLADE RUNNER me ha hecho sentir en sus dos entregas, justo como vivi\u00f3 toda su vida su creador PHILLIP K DICK, ajeno a la aparente realidad, sinti\u00e9ndose parte de un mundo virtual, simulando la repetici\u00f3n de una vida que le perteneci\u00f3 a alguien m\u00e1s, \u00bfDEJA VU? \u00bfTus memorias te pertenecen? \u00bfSue\u00f1an los androides con ovejas el\u00e9ctricas?

Solo la fotografia merita il prezzo del biglietto! Quello che mi ha lasciato in piccola parte deluso \u00e8 una certa meccanicit\u00e0 degli avvenimenti. La storia \u00e8 interessante, il punto di vista del protagonista funziona, i tempi dilatati sono funzionali ma mentre in BR la narrazione fluiva, quasi come se l'atmosfera guidasse la storia e lo spettatore scorrendo con delicatezza, non era fondamentale lo sviluppo ma le sensazioni provate lungo il cammino. In questo film questa magia non si ricrea, ma va anche detto che il cinema di oggi \u00e8 sicuramente diverso, che la sfida era comunque impari e che, ci sono esigenze commerciali (nel dare assurdamente scopi d'incasso al seguito di un film che fu un flop anche a suo tempo) che un po' determinano alcune scelte. Un gran bel film sicuramente, ma i capolavori da storia del cinema per me stanno un gradino, anche bello spesso, pi\u00f9 su.",

I don't want to spoil anything, but I found pretty much every character (even minor ones) sympathetic in their own way; I think it does a better job than the original of examining what it means to be human through different lenses. This is also one of the most gorgeously shot movies I've ever seen, I kept getting distracted from the story by just marveling at how beautiful everything looked and how much there was to see. The sound design and score were also incredible; I feel you could watch it with your eyes closed and still get so much of the emotion and context out of just how the movie sounds. The cast all do amazing jobs, it's still a slow-burn but the action that is there is brutal and exciting, my only criticism would be that it dragged in the third act for me.

The landscape shots, the ever so slow but nice pacing, and the story itself is so marvelous, and of course the soundtrack is intensely satisfying. Harrison Ford as the Blade Runner made it more interesting and he's one of my favorite actors anyways. Plus, it is one of Ridley Scott's best films ever.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 is no different and with modern age actors jumping into a world of wrought and oppression, it is another classic being redefined. At first, I was skeptical at how Harrison Ford's character Rick Deckard plays into this story because it takes place very long after the first one. Star Wars: The Force Awakens work well with his character Han Solo but I was still skeptical with his character Rick Deckard. I mean, how do you propose to continue a story that seemed to be left in a thoughtful \"happy ever after\" ending? Well the director Denis Villeneuve did just that and it really worked out pretty well. It's another movie that proves that even in 30 or so years, you can still pick up story if it's written and done right in cinematic form. All the essence from the first movie are all presented so well in Blade Runner 2049, that it is another favorite movie of mine. Ryan Gosling as the new Blade Runner, named Officer K has once again made me like his performance and I never thought he be this good again in an action type of movie since Gangster Squad.\n\nJared Leto does an outstanding performance as someone who bought the old company from the first movie and began to start developing technology that we're familiar of: Replicants. Robin Wright, omg, what a lovely woman. Her character as the bossy and though Lieutenant Joshi was great as well. An actress that I don't seem to be familiar of, has done some amazing performances in this movie as well and she totally got me off guard. Her name is Sylvia Hoeks, who played as Luv. A character who works for Jared Leto's character Niander Wallace. Harrison Ford's reprise role of Rick Deckard brought me to a personal emotional moment. Especially bringing up the past via the first movie. No doubt that his performance is pretty damn good as always. The beautiful Ana de Armas does a wonderful performance as the titular hologram character. In which I thought she has little spotlight but I'm glad I was wrong because she has a great spotlight in this movie and it's very nice. Her chemistry with Ryan Gosling is so outstanding, that I wish they did another movie together.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 gave off the same kind of vibe that I get with the first movie and it's because the landscape shots and the soundtrack made itself a unique movie. The story progression is so good that even Dave Bautista was so cool in this, even if it was just a brief time. I'll be sure to pick up a copy for myself of this movie but it's just so damn good.",

The presentation of the future is still a great warning for all of us. The movie has amazing FX and has some actions. But the main effect of this movie is still the atmosphere and partially Vangelis alike music. I say alike, because it's a pale imitation of Vangelis style and the music is sadly not always that great, and become too many times a collection of sound effects. The actors are excellent, even the side characters are interesting. Don't go to that movie if you want an action flick or you are tired. The movie required your attention, even if it's mostly a visual film, the plot can be elaborate enough. Villeneuve did a fascinating movie that will go into the rank of classic, with the original one...no less. The music is maybe the aspect where it seems too loud and lacking variety.

            "content": "A sequel to a 35-year-old sci-fi cult classic was always going to be a hard sell. It's a small miracle that a film like Blade Runner 2049 was even made, the original wasn't exactly a money maker back in 1982, nor did the studios at the time allow the film to stay narratively true to its original vision, hell Ridley Scott didn't even gain control of his own film cut till 2007. So here we are in 2017, with an unlikely sequel on our hands.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 does a great job of expanding on the themes of the original, while still managing to tell its own compelling story. Ryan Gosling plays the stone-faced Officer 'K' in a nuanced performance, arguably his best performance since Half Nelson. The supporting cast is standout throughout, bringing the world of Blade Runner 2049 to life, and let me say this, what a gorgeous world it is, frightening and awe-inspiring. Roger Deakins is at the top of his game here, the cinematography is absolutely jaw-dropping, which is not surprising coming from a man who has been nominated 13 times for an Academy Award.\n\nThe languid pacing of the film lends itself perfectly, even though the runtime is 2:45 hours I didn't find myself for one moment disinterested or disengaged, which is quite a feat for a film of this length. The combination of visual flair, sonic mastery, and expertly crafted script make Blade Runner 2049 easily one of my top 10 movies of all time. Please, please please, I implore you, go watch this movie, on the biggest screen possible, experience this film.",

            "content": "So where could they possibly take the Blade Runner franchise after the one-and-done original? Even as 2049 began, I had no idea, but somehow it manages not only to build on the original, develop the story naturally, and evolve it's themes, but sometimes even surpasses them. Replicants have had a rocky history in the last thirty years, being prohibited and brought back gradually after a series of violent outbursts. The Tyrell corp was bought out, there was a blackout that wiped out electronic records across the globe, and even a famine.\n\nSapper Morton benefitted from the famine with his protein farm, living a secluded life away from the dystopian hustle-and-bustle of LA. Until the day K arrives to bring him in, unraveling a miracle impossible to believe that could shake the very foundations of human society if the truth ever got out. To say more would potentially ruin the movie. I went in relatively blind and the mystery that surrounds the whole thing - the origins and revelations of each individual character - gave me so much joy to watch unfold. However, take this as your warning, I wouldn't be able to write the review I'd want to write without spoiling some pretty major stuff, so stop reading now.\n\nThe single biggest theme of both the original and 2049 is what it means to be human, what it means to be alive, how to measure consciousness and sentience, and whether that offers certain rights or not. 2049 builds on that, introducing new concepts with the express purpose of exploring and extrapolating this theme further. K is stated outright from the very beginning that he is a replicant. It's important information as he plays into how he's treated, and how he thinks of himself. While he thinks for himself, he is programmed to obey, and yet that doesn't make him come across as any less human. He's still treated as a lesser-class citizen because of it though, the same way white supremacists treat black people, or Myanmar Buddhists treat the Rohingya. One party sees themself as more important, as more real, and spit on those who they see as beneath them. K is at the bottom of the heap...to a point.\n\nThe most fascinating exploration of this theme in 2049 for me though was the character of Joi. She's a black box on K's wall, an evolved form of Amazon Echo and smart homes. She's an artificial prostitute without the sexual contact. For K, she's he's only companion, his best friend, his confidant. Strictly speaking she's an AI with holographic representation and nothing more, and yet she demonstrates more. She passes the Turing test with flying colours, convincing as a sentience all her own, with her own beliefs, her own desires, her own fears, her own personality. When K \"gifts\" her an emanator so she can leave his apartment and become mobile, she shows genuine delight and wonder at experiencing rain and watching it drop through her holographic fingers. And yet other replicants treat her with disdain. She's artificial companionship, a lesser being who's even less real than they are. It's a truly fascinating angle injected into the movie.\n\nAnother fantastic part of 2049's story is the use and subversion of the 'chosen one' trope. Final warning for MASSIVE SPOILERS here. As the underlying mystery unravels, K starts to believe he is the key to it all. He's about the right age, with a memory that connects him to orphanage records. As the movie goes on, both K and us - the audience - are increasingly led to believe that he is more than just a replicant. He's a special case with the key to everything. We watch him develop from nothing special, to the key to everything, before one final twist that causes this belief in himself to come crashing down around him and he just becomes nothing special again. It's an unprecedented character arc that subverts expectations in the best way. Even after he learns the truth, that he is nothing special, that Joi is just an AI product that told him everything he wanted to hear, he turns himself into something special. He risks his neck for a man he now has no connection to. He picks a side, embraces his heroism and goes for it hell for leather. After learning he wasn't special after all, he goes out and makes himself special, the hero of the story. If nothing else, that is what makes 2049 such a captivating story.\n\nBut there is something else. There's so much in 2049 to unpack, and I want to talk about all of it. Chief amongst them is the cinematography. Roger Deakins is Hollywood's biggest awards underdog. His work is simply astounding time and time again, and 2049 is no exception. Every frame is a canvas to him, as he paints glorious strokes of colour and composition. Every scene outside is grey and miserable, with snow falling peacefully around, and the streets covered in sludge. Everywhere looks like a miserable place to be, whether it's LA's slums, or the rubbish tip that is San Diego, or Morton's maggot farm that resembles a moonbase. The opening shots of the film show fields that stretch as far as the eye can see, bringing them into focus as warehouses, hangars, and industrial greenhouses. Wallace's headquarters tower above the iconic Tyrell pyramid, made of the wealthiest commodity; wood, while Deckard hides out in the irradiated wasteland of Las Vegas, bathed in red and orange hues.\n\nThe soundtrack is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I was disappointed to hear that Johann Johannsson had stepped down from scoring this film, as his work in Arrival was exquisite. Hans Zimmer stepping in was a bit meh. While he's strictly a fantastic film composer, his more recent works have felt phoned in (barring Dunkirk, of course). Another source of immediate disappointment was how little 80s influence there seemed to be. There's the odd synth here or there just peaking out from the cacophony, but otherwise it does little to try and emulate the sound of Vangelis. Furthermore, the soundscapes and ambience that permeates most scenes don't exactly sound like they're beyond Johannsson's skill set. It's the exact same kind of music he scored for Arrival and Sicario.\n\nThat said, what Hans Zimmer and Ben Wallfisch have crafted is still an amazing piece of sonic work. It's an auditory experience felt as much as it is heard, and it brings so much intensity to scenes that would be otherwise lacking. The music never takes the limelight or overstays it's welcome. It's a presence whose impact is felt even when the movie is silent. In fact the sound design in general is just about perfect, adding a whole new dimension to the film, including a fantastic sequence in a vintage casino with Elvis holograms that cut in and out suddenly.\n\nThe acting is also top-notch as well, of course. Ryan Gosling has become famous for his unblinking stares, some of which speak volumes with little surface emotion, while some falls flat and just looks lazy. I saw a video that took the piss out of his blank-faced expressions in the trailer, which was funny and kind of true, but having watched the movie, his lack of facial emoting makes sense. He's a replicant after all. Strictly speaking he doesn't, or at least shouldn't, have emotional responses. He's a blank slate stuck into the world to do one job and one job only. Thankfully the enthralling character arc allows Gosling some room to work, and the emotions he does realise are fully formed and fully empathising.\n\nA big mention goes to Harrison Ford as well, who's turned himself into a bit of a meme in his old age, reviving old franchises and lazing through every scene as if he doesn't really want to be there. 2049 is an exception to the rule. He doesn't go into this for the paycheck, he has a genuine interest in the film, it's source material, and the script that was written for it. He offers his best performance in years, without a doubt, and creates all the impact of the final scene all by himself. Ana de Armas is also really, really good as Joi, giving her a sense of humanity and sentience that quite literally brings her to life. The chemistry she and Gosling share is palpable and goes a long way to developing her role as a non-sexual companion. Sylvia Hoeks is menacing as Luv, Wallace's right-hand assistant. While she doesn't get quite as much meat to play around with, she does have her interesting moments tapping into what it means to be an artificial sentience. The way she treats Joi is heartbreaking, and her snarky posture makes her just as human as her protagonistic opposites.\n\nJared Leto, Robin Wright, Edward James Olmos, Dave Bautista, Mackenzie Davis, Lennie James, Barkhad Abdi, and even a brief appearance from Sean Young all share varying levels of supporting roles, and all enhance the movie in their own little way. Whether it's Wright's subtle advances on K, Bautista's marvel at the miracle he witnessed decades ago, James' quick change of character when he realises K is a cop, or Leto's menacing philosophical musings, each of them make their mark on the movie in such a way that they'd be missed if they weren't there, whether they have two minutes of screen time or fifteen.\n\nFinally I want to mention the CGI, which is used brilliantly. Just like the scoring, it's never overbearing and never steals the limelight. It's used to enhance and not to create all by itself. The vast dystopian vistas would be nothing without CGI, Joi's holographic representation would be nothing without it, and Sean Young being de-aged was a narrative necessity. On the note of Joi's holographic representation though, one of the finest displays of 2049's CGI is a beautifully tender scene between her, K, and Mariette, a prostitute who's tasked with shadowing him. Seeing as Joi is only holographic, K cannot physically interact with her in the way either of them desire to, and so Mariette becomes a surrogate. The way Joi merges with Mariette, and they sync up together and bleed in and out of each other's movements is just about one of the most impressive things I've seen for a long time. The way it's somehow kept from turning creepy or weird, and instead remains tender and beautiful is all the more impressive.\n\nCould 2049 hit a perfect 10/10 rating? I don't think so, but I don't rate anything that well on a first or even second viewing. It has a hell of a lot going for it, from the way it balances nostalgia and self-referentialism to enhancing the story and themes of the original without retreading old ground is probably the best thing about it. But the story it tells and how it wants to tell it is executed to perfection. I have no doubt that in future, if I fancy watching Blade Runner, I'll choose 2049 over the original. Despite being slow and really quite long, it uses every moment to it's favour, building character and atmosphere perfectly. I give 2049 a 9/10, without hesitation. I already want to go to the cinema and watch it again.\n\nhttp://qyrosmovies.blogspot.co.uk/",

There isn't a single speech worthy of Roy Batty's \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...\" \n\nWe also never get a memorable quote like Rachael's \"Have you ever retired a human by mistake?\" when she first meets Deckard, something that cuts to the heart of the issue of being human vs. android. Ryan Gosling is fine in the lead but his character seemed to have been rehashed entirely from \"Drive\" and transplanted into Villeneuve's overwhelmingly depressive universe. The villain was also poorly conceived and thoroughly unbalanced to care about. He's a pale imitation of Tyrell. \n\nI also found the music in Blade Runner 2049 to be inadequate. It's only similarity to the original is that it is electronica, otherwise it is depressingly dark, overbearingly loud, and without respite. It misses the mark of the brilliant Vangelis soundtrack of the original which mixed a futuristic melancholic cocktail. \n\nDenis Villeneuve is an eccentric but inconsistent filmmaker who needs scriptwriters who can match his vision.

The visuals are absolutely stunning in this film, and cinematographer Roger Deakins has really outdone himself. Imagine the visuals of the 1982 classic pumped up to 11. The story this time around has a much more relatable protagonist in Ryan Gosling's character. Certain aspects of the story are unexpected in a Bladerunner film, but work surprisingly well. Think-Bladerunner meets Her (2013). The music by Hanz Zimmer perfectly incapsulates the feel of the original, and gives that beautiful atmosphere of the original to the supercharged visuals.",

This is a real concern right now, and I'm glad.  However, this story is set in a dystopian future (dystopian: ...a community or society that is undesirable and/or frightening - Wikipedia).  No one in this future has a happy fulfilling life.  That's what makes it so interesting.  It's a future where society has failed, and everything is falling apart.  \n\nThe one thing I really don't get, though, is why the character Luv is so weepy.  She's basically a psychopathy.  Why is she crying?  Do psychopaths cry?\n\nMy favorite character is Joi.  It seems like she's broken through her programming limitations, and become something more.  Or has she?  This is something Blade Runner does so well.  Is Deckard a replicant?  Is the dog a clone?  Does it matter?  I love it.",

There is some epic action scenes but the action takes a seat to the investigative story that's going on. CGI and Sound design is the best I've ever seen in movies. This director did an AMAZING job all around. The one caveat I would give this movie is, ITS WAY TO LONG.

Callbacks to the original didn't make it seem like it was connected to the present story. Didn't know this was a sequel until I looked at the first movie. \n2. The fight between Luv and K where Harrison Ford's character was drowning was funny because of the way it was shot. \n3. There were bees in a zone of high radiation on a planet where plants and animals are supposed to be extinct. \n4. Why aren't the blade runners more invulnerable? They can die by getting stabbed, shot, drown. What's the point in making a lifeform that can die by these means?\n5. The main villain was terrible. Like really bad. \n6. Not enough cyberpunk for my tastes. A lot of time spent in wastelands. \n7. K and Ford's fight was terrible because it was set in a broken hologram showroom and the sound was some of the worst I've heard in a movie ever. I get it's a malfunctioning system, but going from deafening to the audience to whispering is annoying. \n8. K and Joi's romance. Unnecessary and kinda lame.\n9. K bringing Joi's memory stick with him and not securing it in anyway, so it falls out of his pocket and gets stepped on, killing his version of Joi.\n10. The whole 'you must kill Ford's character because he can make blade runner babies'. What? How did that even become a part of the story?\n11. The blade runner memory building 'twist'. So predictable and laaaaaaaame. When K get's his memories scanned why doesn't he ask who created his memories? Like what the fuck K. \n12. This movie probably could have been at least 30 minutes shorter.",

The film had pretences of examining what it was to be human, or self-aware... but never did much more than pathetic glorification of reproduction.  The fact it dragged the viewer through 160 minutes of such C+ to B- plot developments... ponderously... just make it worse.

As expetativas estavam ao rubro e o diretor\u00a0Denis Villeneuve, que deu cartas no g\u00e9nero de fic\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica recentemente com o filme Arrival (2016),\u00a0estava ciente da responsabilidade que tinha ao\u00a0assumir o controlo deste distinto e brilhante universo criado por Ridley Scott. T\u00e3o \u00fanico que serviu de inspira\u00e7\u00e3o para todo e\u00a0qualquer filme de fic\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica realizado p\u00f3s Blade Runner. Dito isto, salvo em dizer que Blade Runner: 2049 \u00e9\u00a0a melhor continua\u00e7\u00e3o que o seu original poderia ter.\u00a0N\u00e3o s\u00f3 progride\u00a0a sua hist\u00f3ria, como segue a filosofia de Scott no que toca ao aspeto, ritmo e tom.\n\nEstamos agora em 2049 neste mundo fict\u00edcio e um texto inicial coloca-nos a par de tudo o que aconteceu desde 2019, ano em que\u00a0ocorreu o primeiro filme. A Corpora\u00e7\u00e3o Tyrell entrou em fal\u00eancia e uma outra tomou o seu lugar, a Corpora\u00e7\u00e3o\u00a0Wallace, que continuou\u00a0a criar androides para fazerem o trabalho que os humanos n\u00e3o fazem, mas, desta vez, mais obedientes. O seu criador,\u00a0Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), n\u00e3o poderia ter o ego mais elevado, n\u00e3o fosse ele o g\u00e9nio por tr\u00e1s da resolu\u00e7\u00e3o quer da crise energ\u00e9tica como da fome. No entanto, o foco principal da narrativa est\u00e1 na personagem de Ryan Gosling, de nome\u00a0K. K \u00e9 um agente da pol\u00edcia de Los Angels e\u00a0tamb\u00e9m um blade runner\u00a0que se encontra \u00e0 ca\u00e7a de vers\u00f5es mais antigas das r\u00e9plicas atuais. Ap\u00f3s uma descoberta intrigante, ele come\u00e7a a ter d\u00favidas sobre o seu trabalho, a sua vida e o seu prop\u00f3sito.\n\nNo que toca ao\u00a0enredo, Blade Runner: 2049 \u00e9\u00a0come\u00e7a rapidamente a entrar em territ\u00f3rio de spoilers assim que o come\u00e7amos a desenrolar, portanto resta-me dizer que o filme persegue a crise existencial do seu original, colocando as mesmas quest\u00f5es: O que significa ser humano? ; O que significa ter mem\u00f3ria? ; Quanto \u00e9 que essas mem\u00f3rias nos influenciam? A\u00a0forma cerebral e desafiante como as quest\u00f5es\u00a0s\u00e3o colocadas\u00a0tornam Blade Runner: 2049 num blockbuster sofisticado.\u00a0Oferece\u00a0mais quest\u00f5es do que respostas, mas tem a confian\u00e7a\u00a0necess\u00e1ria para optar por uma montagem\u00a0mais pausada\u00a0e contar a hist\u00f3ria a que se prop\u00f5e, com as suas pr\u00f3prias regras.\n\nTecnicamente, 2049 \u00e9 magn\u00edfico, um aut\u00eantico banquete sensorial. A m\u00fasica de\u00a0Hans Zimmer apresenta\u00a0res\u00edduos de Vangelis e\u00a0eleva-se poderosamente nos momentos de maior emo\u00e7\u00e3o.\u00a0Acrescentar \u00e0 imagem atrav\u00e9s de misturas de sons que representam os estados de esp\u00edrito das personagens ou o caos industrial da cidade.\u00a0A dire\u00e7\u00e3o de fotografia de Roger Deakins \u00e9 simplesmente soberba. O mundo dist\u00f3pico de Blade Runner volta em pleno ao ecr\u00e3, mas desta vez mais degradado, um\u00a0ecossistema\u00a0completamente colapsado, e o estilo noir \u00e9 novamente registado\u00a0na imagem. O jogo de luzes e contrastes\u00a0entre as naturais\u00a0paisagens urbanas\u00a0e a ilumina\u00e7\u00e3o artificial tornam-se cativantes ao olhar.\u00a0Quase cada segundo do filme consegue, de alguma forma, transmitir-nos um plano digno de emoldurar. Sim, \u00e9 um filme que exige muita aten\u00e7\u00e3o, mas sem d\u00favida que\u00a0recompensa.\n\nPara quem se sentir extenuado durante o filme, n\u00e3o condeno, \u00e9 longo\u00a0(2 horas e 41 minutos), e como tal exige alguma predisposi\u00e7\u00e3o para acompanharmos a hist\u00f3ria e deixarmo-nos\u00a0envolver nos seus mist\u00e9rios e proposi\u00e7\u00f5es. A sua qualidade intelectual tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o permite uma satisfa\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00e1cil no final da jornada. Apesar do filme\u00a0concentrar-se nas mesmas quest\u00f5es que o original,\u00a0Villeneuve desenvolve ideias particulares, como por exemplo a problem\u00e1tica da explora\u00e7\u00e3o infantil\u00a0que \u00e9 visualmente abordada.\n\nVilleneuve, que trabalhou com Roger Deakins em filmes tremendos como\u00a0Prisoners (2013) e\u00a0Sicario (2015) afirma-se com Blade Runner: 2049 um dos melhores diretores a trabalhar em Hollywood neste momento. \u00c9 tamb\u00e9m um diretor que claramente sabe guiar\u00a0atores. Destaque para\u00a0Gosling com uma performance minimalista e\u00a0expressiva,\u00a0de Armas, que interpreta Joi de forma convincente\u00a0e Harrison Ford, que volta no papel de\u00a0Deckard para uma atua\u00e7\u00e3o com muito, muito cora\u00e7\u00e3o.\u00a0Villeneuve disse numa entrevista que apenas aceitou realizar este filme porque n\u00e3o queria que nenhum outro diretor estragasse a propriedade. O\u00a0resultado foi uma obra acarinha do in\u00edcio ao fim, um filme que ama o seu antecessor, mas que possui\u00a0uma identidade pr\u00f3pria.\n\n9/10",

Demolition plays easy backdrop to heroism.\n\nDenis Villeneuve, however, seems a more sentimental director. In Blade Runner 2049, he builds a world in order to regard it. These sets aren't meant to crumble; they're meant to suggest a value system and ecosystem that already has. These are the lasting monuments to a ravaged earth and a ravaged humanity alike. \n\nLong stretches of the film's 164 minutes are devoted to taking in the sights and pondering the decay. Audiences can be forgiven for expecting more flying car chases and less slow creeps down a corridor. Past-tense ruminations aren't typically the stuff of blockbusters, but it's the stuff of Blade Runner 2049.\n\nVilleneuve's sentimentality extends back to his source material, as well. In fact, if BD 2049 has one flaw it's that it leans too heavily on the original for its dramatic impetus. For those not familiar with the original, formidable swaths of the sequel will either be nonsensical or dramatically uncompelling. But fans of the first Blade Runner will be relieved to see the name not bastardized or trotted out for cheap thrills and easy marketing. \n\nVilleneuve's updates to the mythos of Blade Runner are conscientious and well earned. The first film complicated the question of what makes humans human by introducing synthetic organisms, known as \"replicants.\" Blade Runner 2049 doesn't resolve any of those complications; it only deepens their mystery.\n\nThe new film blurs not just the organic and the synthetic, but also the transcendent and the translucent. Digital holograms flicker at the border of the human and non-human, the real and unreal. Appearing in various forms throughout the film, holograms act as the immaterial containers for all that a society might rightly hold dear: history, memory, desire, companionship, even love. All that was solid, now merely glints in the air. \n\nIn a world of holograms, how to tell the truth from a projection? The social fabric from a fabrication? The light from an LED?",

The visual effects and set designs are also remarkably well-done, creating a rich visual aesthetic that's a marvel to look at.  And the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch brilliantly compliments the scenes and sets a dark and intense mood.

You can stop now and I'll never know.\n\nBlade Runner 2049\nWatched on 10/5/17 and 10/14/17\nNo spoilers\n\nEvery once in awhile, a film comes along and leaves a scar on the face of cinema. Ridley Scott's Blade Runner contorted the definition of the sci-fi film genre. Blending themes of mystery, police drama, dystopian futures, obsolescence, action and most importantly love.This film has inspired many filmmakers and it's blood can be found pulsing through many films veins. A relatively quiet, reserved, deliberately paced yet harrowing masterpiece. 35 years later Denis Villeneuve's, Blade Runner 2049, has not only enhanced it's predecessor and expanded the film genre but sets a new standard for modern storytelling. The story is complex and has rich, expansive history but it is told simply and elegantly. A film primarily from an android's point of view, (\"replicants,\" they are defined in this franchise\"), has never felt so human.\n\nPlot synopsis are my least favorite things to write, and trying to come up with a catchy way to explain Blade Runner 2049, seems pointless. As simply as I can put it, this is a film asking what it means to be alive. Not exactly an easy question to answer. But, perhaps my favorite aspect of this film is that it doesn't try to resolve it. Villeneuve and crew and cast do not give us softball, crowd pleasing scenes and low hanging answers, yet the film does not self indulgently blur the lines. It doesn't try to fuck with you, it just presents itself. This film is ripe for discussion, debate, and repeated viewings. Not because we will find the answer but rather we find the question is just too fascinating.\n\nThis film made me feel insignificant in scope, with a future that doesn't seem so far off. Advertisements 20 feet tall, dance in the street battling for our attention, the sun is all but faded, rain constantly pours down, snow falls, a shower is a single quick, painful, blast of water, farm lands are now covered tents that solely attempt to grow protein sources, art is obsolete, artists are little more than factoids, it's just high rise after high rise, cramming humans and replicants into as little a space as possible. Blade Runner 2049, isn't on a high horse, spewing some political agenda, it just makes sense, this is the direction we are heading. It's nearly impossible as an audience member to realistically avoid it.\n\nIt's frightening, it's absolutely terrifying. All politics, religion, etc. aside this is the way the world is becoming. Disassociation with other humans, is leading to increased obsession with technology. Even after my own breakups, failed relationships and more recently Tinder debacles, I've often thought as film as my true love. Feeling disconnected and somewhat alienated from my own generation. The longing for true human connection is a lifelong battle, many never win.\n\nBlade Runner 2049, captures this emotion, this fear, and makes an entire world from it.\n\nI've seen the film twice, the 1st time the major realization was this was not a colossal train wreck. I'll be the first to admit, I am jaded, people. In a galaxy of sequels, remakes, reboots, and \"cinematic-universe-franchises,\" I am worn out and bitter. I am tired of all of it. Even with a director as talented and proven as Denis Villeneuve, I was not going to let myself get excited just to be let down. It was after I processed the blisteringly tense opening scene, I understood 2049, was it's own film. This movie, wasn't going to take any prisoners or pull any punches I knew I would invest myself in paying attention and critically thinking about the plot. This honestly lessened my enjoyment of the film, rather than experience it, I was trying to solve it. I walked out of the theater thinking \"wow, that was unique and really good.\" Masterpiece did not enter my thought space at the time. Yet I have to admit, I saw a double feature of Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049 on a late Thursday night, single showing. I also have to admit, I was exhausted going into the 8pm showing. I didn't come out til nearly 2am. I knew immediately upon leaving, I needed to see this again.\n\nThe 2nd viewing is where I truly experienced this film and was floored by it's impact. I was less focused on me just trying to connect all the dots and much more open to relaxing and just watching. I found I was fully submersed in every single frame this film offered. Each and every second on screen occupied my mind. My job, my income, my stress, my crippling lack of self esteem, all faded away. I was entranced, and the nearly 3 hour runtime blew by. Rather than assembling the plot, I found I was thinking about the themes of the film, the message, the scenery, the score actually hit me this time around. It was an absolutely, incredible, experience.\n\nI did want to discuss the score. It's unconventional to say the least. We expect a Hans Zimmer score to be battered with percussion, operatic chorus, intense stringed sections. What we receive is an industrial, metallic, blaring scream of various sounds. It's minimalistic, yet it's heavy and fierce. The sounds of motorcycles roaring, deep bass, distorted synthesizers. If I hadn't ever heard of Skinny Puppy, Death Grips, or Trent Reznor's deep cuts, I'd be ignorant enough to say 2049's score isn't music at all. But this works, it was crafted for this film, in the universe where art and music are essentially dead, this score is real, this is what we need to hear.\n\nWhile the score, the environments and sets, the effects are all fantastic, where Villeneuve and crew shine the most is performances. We all know what Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling are capable of. Ford is the kingpin of franchise roles, and is settling into the grizzled vet chapter of his career quite nicely. Gosling is the perfect blend of a dreamy, hunk, yet there is subtle spark of insanity in his face. We see this exponentialized in Drive and The Place Beyond The Pines. I'll admit I am a softie for Gosling, something in the way he acts just sells me I've always thought he was incredibly talented and admired his role choices. I have to say Blade Runner 2049, is without a doubt his best performance. Robin Wright, her performance in House of Cards had her down as one of my favorite performers. She plays a powerful political figure in HoC and she plays a hard nosed, no nonsense, lieutenant in 2049. Her tough as nails, cold, calculated dialogue is delivered with a hint of a vulnerability I only picked up on the 2nd viewing. She is fantastic. Sylvia Hoeks, jeez where do I begin? She is merciless and ruthless, in her quest for power. Jared Leto. I feel like that name typed just like that, says enough. I actually really enjoy Leto, his range of roles and unique style is attractive to me. He delivers as expected. In the right role Leto shines, and 2049 is a perfect cannon for his firepower. He is oily, uncomfortable, reserved and haunting.\n\nAmongst these great performances one tiny role that truly stands out.\nA small role can have a huge impact, and this performer fills the screen with his intimidating physical mass yet his personality contrasts that frame as a quiet farmer living in solitude. The scene and performance is further contrasted by shocking, brutal, violence. It wasn't that I don't want to believe in a reality where World Wrestling Entertainment sensation \"Batista,\" can act, I merely was not aware I was already in this actual reality in which Dave Bautista acts extraordinarily well. Just goes to show, stop judging. My little preconceived notions of what people are capable of, are shattered regularly. And this film is a towering reminder of that.\n\nThere is a ton more to unpack here, and I will, I fully plan on expanding on my ideas here and watching the film again breaking down scenes and themes and writing about it. But for now, no spoilers,no complete analysis. I just wanted to share my ideas and hopefully inspire more folks to see this great movie.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 shines, not only as a sci-fi film, but as a beacon of light in a time where finding the urge to put on pants, let alone go to a movie theater is actually worth the hustle. This film is not just a great sequel and successor, but an achievement in film. What it lacks in box office revenue (as if we care) it more than makes up for in this beautiful, fantastic, frightening, yet not entirely hopeless, piece of cinema. It's many messages are important and timely for a generation that needs all the help it can get.",

Where the 1982 original was a technical masterpiece with its fair share of existential themes it more or less was a simple noir film. Five minutes into \"2049\" and we are plunged into much more complicated territory than the original. Without spoiling the film it takes what I wished the protagonist would be from the original and expands upon Phillip K Dick's themes of mortality hindering this film closer in terms of emotional complexity to the book \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" Director Denis Villeneuve was the perfect choice with his taste in crime drama from \"Sicario\" to \"Prisoners\" and science fiction with \"Arrival.\" Seeing the progress of Ridley Scott's recent work (cough cough \"Alien Covenant\") it was a relief that Scott stood back from the director's chair.\n\nIf this film doesn't lament Roger Deakins a long deserved Oscar then I don't know what will. This is an astounding looking picture where every dilapidated landscape must be seen on a big screen in 2D. 3D would only eliminate most of the intricately placed lighting setups. If you watch this film on your telephone then I hope David Lynch personally walks up to it and smashes right it in front of you. \n\nIt has been almost a month since I have seen this film and I still can't get it out of my head. I haven't enjoyed a picture this throughly in almost ten years. It is an absolute shame that audiences chose to ignore something so masterful in favor of junk food like \"Happy Death Day\" or \"Thor Ragnarok.\" \n\nFor more of my thoughts on the film check out my video review here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3Wo3v-SgBk",

I won't even get into the plot, because you should go into this film knowing nothing other than what you learned from the first. 2049's plot is smart and complex, knowing what the audience is thinking and then taking a completely different turn. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, every shot is filled with a majestic landscape. Whether it is futuristic Los Angeles or the wastelands of Las Vegas, Roger Deakins, the man behind the camera is a true master. Despite the 2 hour and 44 minute run time, there is absolutely no way you could be bored with the amount of eye candy given to you. Ryan Gosling is spectacular playing Officer K who is a character who deals with so much discrimination, and Gosling captures it perfectly. Harrison Ford as on older Rick Deckard serves up his best role in years, giving the feel that he is traumatized by his previous experiences. Overall, Blade Runner 2049 delivers a fascinating, complex Sci-Fi story that not only makes 2049 a great sequel, but a spectacular stand-alone achievement. Without a doubt, Blade Runner 2049 is the most perfect movie of the year and absolutely deserves an A+.",

I was hoping Blade Runner 2049 might grow on me during the 2nd viewing, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. I'll list my reservations with it below:\n1.\tThe film is too long. You have to produce this film within 2 hours and there is so much pointless stuff in there that can be cut. It desperately needs a new cut. Start by cutting the pointless prostitute scene and also the one where the replicant is born and get murdered a few minutes later. A lot of the violence/nudity is pointless and should be cut.  \n2.\tThere is a lack of a central, simple plot. The first film has quite a simple plot, which is necessary because it's a difficult film to understand with complex themes. This film is all over the place. It has the complexity of the original and also a plot that jumps around. It's too much. \n3.\tThe music is really lacklustre. It's not a patch on what Vangelis did for the original. It seems to be intentionally toned down?\n4.\tThere is poor character development. I'm afraid Officer K is not an invigorating character. You really won't care what happens to him either way. He shows little emotion and is not a character that you can invest in. The best character is Luv who is an able replacement for Roy Batty. Tyrells replacement is a totally unrealistic psychopath. What a joke. The characters need to be feasible so that we feel like we are watching something real. \nIn summary, get this film cut down to 2 hours by cutting out the pap and energise the soundtrack. Then it can be almost as good as the original, but never as good due to the poor character development mentioned earlier. I'll still give it 4/5 due to the even lower quality of other movies being released at the moment.",

Immediately I think I can say I like it better than the original in that it fills a lot of holes the original has to make this an overall fuller movie. That said it also loses a lot of the original world and makes it a little too digital and too high-tech (yeah yeah I know 40 years have passed but a big part of the charm of the original was some of its low-tech high-techness), though it makes up for that in some truly beautiful and haunting lighting at least. Also an amazing future superfund Las Vegas full of giant naked women that are super trashy but also like of course it would be.\n\nSpoilers...\nWhat I loved the most about this was just how we follow K (a Kafka reference, surely) though his entire story of discovery and awakening only to learn that he's not even the main character in his own life - his memories and revelations are all fake, his girlfriend is fake and everything she says is just recycled programming, and there's nothing special about him at all, he's just a replicant. Very sobering.\n\nI love the lofty feel, the silences, the lighting, the shots of a mangy dog in shadow so that you can't tell if its friend or foe. Using the reflection of light through water as a way to light an entire room. A robot who's programmed to feel emotions so that when she murders somebody she cries but it's obviously just a hollow automatic response.\n\nThe whole thing was beautiful, thoughtful and sad.",

He's not real, his lover/companion is not real yet here we are developing an innate attraction and feelings towards what should not be more than a lamp shade.\n\nAs he's convinced to be the Replicant messiah so are we and it begins to make sense, \"Oh, he's at least half human, alright!\", but once the mystery unravels and he's not to be, we're compelled to reason with ourselves. Does it matter? What he felt, what we felt as an audience was real and it's there that we truly question the relevance of authenticity. Brilliant.\n\n2049 is such an intelligent way to present a Sci Fi theme that has been beaten to death over the years repeatedly yet here it stands resonating, defying the idea that it can't be done. It's a convincing example that it's not only important to tell themes in new ways but it's key to have multiple elements of your story focus on it as well.\n\nIt also says a lot to respect and bring elements of the original film into the story without making it feel like a cheap nod, kudos!\n\nIf criticisms are to be had, it really should be where Deckard (Ford) is arbitrarily sent off-world to be intercepted by K. It sets up this bizarrely staged climatic fight between our protagonist and badass villainess Vu (Hoeks)\n\nThere will also be complaints about pacing but honestly it's just filming sensibilities from different generations, by 80's standards this is the norm but you can make the argument that this is a 2017 release and it should have adapted. I was fine with it either way.\n\nIn the end Blade Runner 2049 is an undeniable success that not only respects it's source material but enhances it beyond what could be expected!",

In a semblance of doing something meaningful, it is laced with hooks and triggers - religious pointers such as the God figure, represented by Ford whose Heaven is Las Vegas with an endless supply of label whisky; the infantile Son figure of Gosling; and a remotely wafting Spirit figure. Female roles consist of stereotypes:  the severe, older career woman; the pure woman; the \"fallen women\" - what they all have in common is that the women are only happy when self-sacrificing.  Picking up on the trend exemplified by the misogynistic Ex Machina, of showing the sadistic abuse of, by and between women with the excuse that they are robots, this film also appeals to the lower sexist fantasies. In an unsavoury scene, Gosling's character and the camera relish for too long on the killing of a female enemy. The film is advertising for gambling, booze, exploitation and a certain electronics brand, and for robotics. In particular, the idea represented by the tenderised Gosling role, that is in our interest for humans to merge with the robots. The bad guy is a boring type who lives in an architect-designed cave that is apparently cleaned by other people after he messes it with the blood of violence. Like in Ex Machina, he is the below-average guy who lives the worst of his dreams. A poorly dressed, inarticulate, deeply unattractive type, he yet commands armies of designer women, whom he can create, maim, kill and dispose of at will. Our saviours will be the pure white people; those who comply with them and merge with the machines will survive; the rest will live on a vast garbage dump. Still, this film takes itself really seriously. The screenplay and editing keep drumming things in, to the point of becoming comical: the \"woman\" strokes the back of Gosling's head with four hands; then that wretched pony keeps turning up just in time; or when Ford stares disbelievingly at his anachronistically styled - and much younger - past flame (didn't he meet her in 2029 not 1940?), as if he is about to take a piece out of the producers for putting him in that situation.  Her role and styling, if they were intended to pull emotional strings about the 1940s, would be doubly facile wrong for that. Don't worry about dozing off: the film's story overall is a well-trodden path that you can join at any point. At one brief moment, Gosling can contain his acting no more and lets fly. Otherwise, for all its deeper faults, the show's biggest failure is to be humourless and monotone. It lets down the work of the effects team.  Still, if you stick the film out, you may start laughing at it. One star - for the nice old dog, whose fate we never learned.",

Anyone who's watched Alien: Covenant knows he has a lot to say about creation, and Blade Runner 2049 would have been the perfect movie for him to expand on that without the tired horror of Aliens holding him back. Still, Denis Villeneuve has knocked just about every movie he's made out of the park, and this movie is no exception.\n\nEven though it's been 35 years since the original came out, it's depressing to see how little futuristic Los Angeles has changed since the events of the first Blade Runner. It is still the sprawling, dystopian megalopolis, ruled by corporations while the multicultural poor toil under the shadow of soulless skyscrapers. Villeneuve revels in showing off and inhabiting the world of Blade Runner, taking every opportunity to give us sweeping vistas of the city and its desolate outskirts. Like the original, Blade Runner 2049 brings its world to life with dark, oppressive colors, dim light, and thick fog that obscures the distance. The only light in Los Angeles comes from the neon advertisements promising escape from humanity's dreary existence. Complementing the stunning videos is the soundtrack. Synthesized and with a heavy bass, the music of Blade Runner is enthralling and versatile. It can be atmospheric or dramatic, violent or tranquil. It works so well for both the environment as well as every scene that the music features more prominently than in the original movie.\n\nWhile the original's narrative was a relatively straightforward neo-noir, Villeneuve and his screenwriters opted instead for a convoluted cinematic epic, filled with twists and turns. Thankfully, the filmmakers are smart enough to avoid the trap of answering the question of whether or not Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard is a replicant, although they do tease it late in the film. In fact, it's hard to tell if any of the characters are replicants or \"real\" humans. Even the villain has so many cybernetic enhancements that he's the least human of all the characters. It helps that just about every character has stellar acting, even the ones who show up for only one scene. The downside, though is that we're left wanting more of Barkhad Abdi (Captain Philips) and Lennie James (The Walking Dead) so we can get a glimpse into how people eke out a living. Whoever cast the Palestinian actress, Hiam Abbass, as the revolutionary, by the way, is a genius.\n\nStill, Blade Runner 2049 is an 80s revival, and a sequel at that, and with it comes all of Hollywood's failing business practices. At one point, Sony product places itself as one of the corporate overlords without a sense of irony, which actually makes Blade Runner's future look frighteningly plausible on a meta level. Even though the movie clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, it doesn't wrap up the saga like you'd expect. Instead, it spends its time setting up for a sequel, obviously hoping to turn Blade Runner into a franchise that could compete with Disney's Marvel and Star Wars, but if this means we get another Blade Runner by Denis Villeneuve, I'm all right with that, because Blade Runner 2049 is almost a masterpiece.",

            "content": "I'm a huge fan of Harrison Ford, seen every movie of his (including 6 days and 7 nights, Sabrina, Hollywood Homocide) except for the watching Blade Runner in its entirety. A film that has like 6 different cuts, and slow pacing. I know a lot of people that think that those who complain about the pacing, are dumb mouth breathers who should just stick to watching Transformers. However there are plenty films that I enjoyed with a slow pace. Why do the films I like differ from Blade Runner, because the characters were interesting, the dialogue and the premise. As mentioned I'm a Ford fan, however there's nothing interesting about his character (which is probably why they tried to setup the idea of him being a Nexus model), Sean Young does nothing for me. The only interesting character was Rutger Hauer. I'm sure back in 82 it was interesting to see a sci-fi noir film in futuristic L.A. The special effects are gorgeous and it was one of the early adopters of dark futuristic films (yes I seen Escape from New York). However Blade Runner was not an instant classic, it gained cult status over time due to the many renditions of the film. So that explains why I haven't seen the first film in it's entirety. I plan on seeing it however the design of the future can't be the only thing that'll keep me watching. The characters have to be interesting too.\nSo with that out of the way. Denis Villanueve had one shot to make it work, no special cut or alternate editions and he made it work. It may sound like I'm countering my complaint for the first film. But the look is beautiful and colorful. It definitely seems like the L.a. from the first film just updated after time has passed. This film is escapist at best. When people are talking about the great movie experience, its films like this. The sound design is also great. Hearing the street sounds of the cars whizzing by really puts the audience in the environment. \nRight out the gate, we know that Gosling is a android Blade Runner. During one of his Blade Runner missions he comes across android remains. Through the autopsy it is discovered that the android was pregnant. This sparks interest in the film, a half human-half android. The fact that androids can conceive makes up for a good plot. So Gosling is trying to put together clues to figure out who is the human replicant hydrid. Also believing that it could be him due to his memories. Gosling like Ford is bland, but that's purposefully due to the fact that he's a replicant. Joi his holographic spouse aids him in solving the mystery. Ford actually makes Deckard interesting in this film. Great action scenes, the mystery is what keeps the audience interested.\nGreat movie, might I even say better than the first. I know the first film help defined sci-fi noir and a sprawling futuristic cityscape. However this film nailed the story in one theatrical cut. Only problem is that it's long. Please see early so that you can watch the film and go on about your day.",

This is fine to an extent and as I've said the film is beautiful, but it sacrificed pacing as a result and it becomes a chore to sit through. The original does take it's time too and is a relatively slow film, but it balanced this with an even runtime. 2049 is definitely a film that could get better after a couple of rewatches but only time will tell. For me the standout performance of the film wasn't Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, certainly not Jared Leto and not even the nasty, sneering Luv played by Sylvia Hoeks but Ana de Armas who was a joy to watch as Joi, Ryan Gosling's virtual girlfriend. Her role was definitely an inventive, captivating addition to prceedings.\n\nFor those people who do have an interest in seeing this film, I highly recommend going to see it while it's in the cinema, it does not fail in being a sight to behold on the big screen, even it becomes a drag to sit through at times.",

However, it seems much like the original, that Blade Runner 2049 will not meet its status as an iconic sci-fi film for some years to come. This is a visual masterpiece, depicting the most beautiful ruin of a city that has graced a film. From beginning to end in its 2h 44min run-time, it captivates the wonder of a decrepit dystopian world, all of which is shot beautifully by the incomparable Roger Deakins. The cast led by Ryan Gosling who plays \"K\" and Harrison Ford who returns as \"Rick Deckard\", act superbly to create an awe-inspiring film on the big screen. Under the direction of Denis Villeneuve, Blade Runner 2049 shows that he is one of the most talented directors and one of the few masters of storytelling in the movie business today.",

Other movies may be visually stunning (Avatar) but this movie goes beyond human emotions into uncharted territory.   What puts Blade Runner 2049  on another level from most science fiction movie is the sense that one is glimpsing a not very distant future.   Climate change, nuclear winter, the blurred lines between human and artificial intelligence keep this movie compelling for the entire two and a half hours plus.   From the virtual reality jukebox where, for a quarter, one can not only hear Frank Sinatra but see him, to the neon lights advertising Sony, CocaCola and (inexplicably) Atari, this movie is an edge of one's seat winner.  Just as one scene disappears, the incredible score leads one to the next which may seem mysterious but, in the end, the plot threads do come together, sort of.  Whomever comes along to film Blade Runner 2075, assuming movies still exist,  will have a high bar to clear.  A classic.  Stunning.",

I kinda thought it had some cool ideas in it and I enjoyed the characters, but I never loved it the way I wanted to as a big sci fi fan. Along with that I have never really liked Dennis V's film I did not like Prisoners or Sicario much at all, but at the same time as a sci fi junkie I knew I wouldn't be able to help myself and with the recent Ghost in the Shell movie that came out I knew I had to see after that.\n\nAnd Im glad I did cause this movie is pretty enjoyable. I did not think it was the greatest film ever like most critics say it is, but it deals with a lot of interesting ideas and Ryan Gosling dies a exceptional job as this new replicant character who we have to follow now.\n\nAlso you do not need to see the first Blade Runner to like this movie. The movie does a great job catching new viewers up on the events of the first one so that you can enjoy this one as its own movie. It doesn't feel like it is trying to set up a franchise either. It is defiantly its own thing and as that I kinda really liked it.\n\nI thought Jared Leto also did a fine job in his scenes. He was not playing the Joker in this movie. His role was pretty intense and pretty contained. Defiantly found it to be a solid performance from this star.\n\nAlso Ana de Armas who plays the AI has a really emotional relationship with K that I found to be really good as well. It was a really interesting bond that I wanted to see more of throughout the film.\n\nAnd Sylvia Hoekswas like OMG. She was probably my favorite performance in the whole film. She was truly frightening.\n\nOverall I highly enjoyed this film. Did I think it was the greatest thing ever..no I did not, but with so much against it I felt it came out on top for me.",

Most mid range 5.1 home systems can easily outperform most theaters (that most hdtvs lack for some reason). This movie was the best reason to accually go to a theater.

The cyber-noir also challenges the audience by addressing the very existential and identity crises that plagues the modern world whilst presenting an alternative that we are not permitted to see through to it's end. \nDespite all the layers of code to be interpreted and endlessly broken down, Bladerunner in it's entirety pleases you but does not leave one satisfied.

The stories behind the \"androids\" and the \"computer wife\" were all compelling and heartfelt. I loved the set up, the pacing, the delivery, the ending. The music was perfect for the movie... I almost didn't want to leave when the credits were rolling. I just can't say enough good things about this movie, and I really need to go watch it again on the big screen. \n\nIf you pressed me for some minor gripes, it might be that the replicant farm hallway felt a little too borrowed from the recent HBO Westworld series and was too ugly to deserve to be part of this movie... but the point of the whole sequence made sense and revealed what it needed to of Wallace's character. Another gripe would normally be not seeing any green nature in the film... yet that was a big part of the story, and it didn't really bother me anyway since it was shot so artfully to begin with. I will say in the theater I was in, the high end sounds were just too loud... definitely a personal thing with recent movies in modern theaters. \n\nHighly recommended... and last personal note is that I feel it's soon time for me to go to 4K at home so I can enjoy some of these awesome films after they leave the big screen.  Please Hollywood, more quality flicks like this!",

With the exception of some grandiose establishing shots, there's little in the way of extraneous footage that could be trimmed out here - nearly everything serves the narrative in some way or another. The narrative itself is more coherent than that of the previous film, while still exploring many of the same themes and retaining a bit of the same ambiguity, which will no doubt spark a whole new series of questions. In short, Blade Runner 2049 is not only a worthy sequel, it's a superior one, an achievement made all the more impressive by the 35-year gap since the original.",

Harrison Ford, who joins Gosling at close to the half way point of the film doesn't show his age and also proves that he's still got a lot of energy left in him. The film's look needs to be credited to the amazing cinematographer Roger Deakens who cut his teeth shooting many of the Coen Brothers's films. Jared Leto also makes the most of his 20 minutes as the creepy creator of replicants. This is a film that will shock and awe you with its size and scale but that doesn't depart from the dense storytelling that made the first outing so enjoyable.

The way the movie was written, it is all his character's story, much more than the original was Deckerd's story. We CARED about the replicants, even when they were violent, because they had human desires and emotions. But in this sequel, the replicants are supposedly cured of any desire to rebel and Fancher et.al seemed to decide this meant they had very few human emotions besides anger or in Gosling's case, generally being a sadsack. Because Gosling's character has no burning desires, it is hard to care about him, and yet he has to carry the whole movie. It would be like if you wrote a movie starring Mr. Spock's brother who was 100% Vulcan and had no human emotions. It would be unsustainable. None of the other characters is integrated into the plot enough to be compelling. Jared Leto is a cartoon villain without the humor, and I won't get into the really retrograde attitudes towards women, real or otherwise. I wish they had hired David Peoples, the other credited screenwriter on the original, for this update instead of Fancher. David is always so interesting (12 Monkeys, Unforgiven) and really understands character, even the female variety!",

The visuals are simply amazing and the performances are great too, except Jared Leto's, which feels at times one-dimensional and shallow. I like the slow pace that the director takes a lot. The only real step down from the original is the music, which emulates the sound of the original Vangelis score, but does not do anything with those sounds, it just leaves them there. While it works to some degree, there's nothing special about it.",

New to my son, we first watched the Final Cut version of Blade Runner and the three short films released prior to the new movie (these filled in some of the story between the two feature films).  For BR2049, we saw the 3D version.  A a film, this was very impressive.  It was clearly made by exceptional people working at the top of their game.  Though 3D tends to make the images darker, the filmmakers had paid extra attention to this process and it shows.  It's not showy 3D but it worked remarkably well.  As for the movie, it's done in the Blade Runner style but it feels like a Daniel Villeneuve film:  moody, slow/deliberate, with occasional short bursts of violent action.  I think for many, this can be a bit boring for a long movie like this one.  The movie never flt boring but it seemed like some strategic snipping could have easily been done.  \n\nThe movie is all about Ryan Reynolds and he appears in almost every scene. He's mostly emotionless  with an undercurrent of despair, making this movie even more gloomy.   It was surprising that some key characters only had a few minutes of screen time.  Ford's role is more substantive, though you have to wait for it.  I think his role requires viewing the original Blade Runner (Final Cut) movie first.  Most of the other main characters are women and they did impressive work.\n\nThe soundtrack paid tribute to the original film.  It was quite immersive, too.  But it was also very loud, at times.  My ears are still ringing.\n\nMy son, who's into films, really was impressed.  It's certainly a sight to behold.  Though one important theme was about what it is to be human, I found the emotional impact to be wanting.   Still, it was and impressive display of talent...an achievement worth recognizing.",

            "content": "If Blade Runner (the first one) left a lasting impression on you, then I think you will probably be happy with this sequel.  However, some of the \"wow factor\" that came with the first one (such as from being immersed in the grim-looking, hi-tech-yet-dilapidated future Earth; synthetic humans having extraordinary abilities; questions about what \"a living thing\" is and whether it has a soul; and even some of the hunt-down-and-fight-with-the-bad-guys action scenes) could not be replicated (no pun intended) in this film, because many satisfying films and TV shows since then (like the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica) built upon and entertainingly fed us such themes and elements.  So, this sequel came across to me as a slow-burning extension of the first film, with some now-familiar themes and feel that will probably disappoint those who just want to be thrilled by lots of action, visual effects and slap-me-on-the-back camaraderie (I'm thinking of the many comic book-based films that have come out over the past several years, such as those in the Avenger franchise).  The pace of the film may be slow, but it is deliberate and kept my interest.  It takes its time to bathe you in its setting, characters and unfolding plot.  At well over 2.5 hours, I rarely felt as though footage was unnecessary.  I thought that some of the acting was superb.  I agree with the \"Critics Consensus\" that it is \"visually stunning and narratively satisfying.\"  As I suggested before, I just don't think it will be satisfying for those who show up more for action and thrills.",

            "content": "Exciting cinematography in the opening scenes of Blade Runner 2049: the noir tones of the original film replaced by ashy whites of a dusty landscape that looked like either an alkali farm or Ice Station Zebra.   This was the perfect photographic \"negative,\" a brighter view, suggesting that things hidden would be revealed, normalcy and daylight would let us examine the issues raised in the original  without that dank sense of dread.\n\nAnd Ryan Gosling, the perfect emcee, he of LaLaLand and The New Micky Mouse Club.   Like a talk show host he would take care of us.   The point of the original Blade Runner was that no one took care of you.  That's why people love it, it's uncompromising, gemlike, almost cruel.   How I longed for the discipline of the sharp cut after two hours and forty-nine minutes of this metastasized bloat.   The visuals quickly turned gray and derivative.  You would think in 32 years the landscape would have changed beyond plunking down giant holographic ballerinas in the same post-apocalyptic cityscape.\n\nThe only bread-leavening (see previous review of the original) is a confusing, overblown plot, one that screams for another sequel in which the \"humane\" replicants will begin to breed and rebel against the machine-like cruel humans.  Perhaps their leader will be named \"Caesar\".  We've seen this story before in the many wretched \"Planet of the Apes\" sequels and reboots which will never displace that masterful original.\n\nThe original Blade Runner grapples with issues of what it means to be human, whether it's a meaningful distinction, and whether death adds to that meaning.  In the sequel the desire of the replicants isn't \"more life,\" it's the ability to reproduce through birth, without a master-builder.   But the sequel never delves into why the manner in which you are produced matters.  It's a rich question: humans can be seen as bound by determinism, genetic inheritance, social conditioning - to what extent does free will exist, what does it import that we can we change our genetic code via epigenetics?  And to what extent are replicants able to have free will ?   The fact that the Nexus 6 models rebelled, which was not programmed into them, suggests they do have at least some independence.\n\nThe only way that these questions can be made compelling is placed in the context of relationships between characters.  The failure to do that is the central weakness of the original Blade Runner and also of Blade Runner 2049.  The original was structured in a way that this weakness mattered less: it was fractalized, episodic, promethean in it's vision.   A successful sequel cannot be visually imitative, and is only successful if it moves the concepts of the original forward, in other words, if it adds.  Adding more plot does not count, it makes things worse.  Watching this film I felt like I'd  been dumped into season 4 of \"A Game of Thrones\" without ever having seen an episode beforehand.\n\nHampton Fancher, was bitterly upset after getting replaced by David Peoples as a writer on the original, and he layers on every plot twist he can think of.    Is \"K\" the first-born child of replicant Rachael, and maybe-replicant Deckerd?   Or was that a female child?  Or they were twins so both?   Would that mean we now have races of reproducing replicants, along with humans?  Why does this matter?  Because the replicants are so much smarter and stronger and would crush the humans?  Would they employ their own non-breeding replicant helpers?   This movie bites off way more than it or the audience can chew.\n\nI respected the effort to raise issues like that, it's just that Blade Runner 2049's weaknesses highlighted it's other weaknesses: the confusing themes called for characters who could embody and transcend them.  Instead we get impish Ryan Gosling who like Sarah Jessica Parker, seems always aware of his own celebrity.  And the new slurring Harrison Ford who makes an appearance 90 minutes in, has transformed into an actor who always seems partially demented and wild-eyed, like an old man ordering kids to get off his lawn.\n\nHow are we to believe that he is soulful and had a great love for Rachael?  They had no chemistry in the original.  Deckerd-manque \"K\" falls in love with his hologram-cyber-geisha -  again to what end, why, and based on what?  Nothing we saw on the screen.   This movie was created as a launching pad for a slew of studio-system sequels, ones in which the interesting questions will be buried in proxy myth: \"they are human because they stick together\", \"sacrifice for the group makes us all better\".  How this is from the bracing: \"I want more life, fucker!\".\n\nLet's try to really be creative and think of how the themes  raised in the original movie could have been developed, advanced, without Villanueve's derivative treatment:\n\nThe world is vastly different from what it was 32 years ago.  Humans are no longer crowded into wet alleys and overcrowded cities.  They are in brightly-lit but sterile parsected sections of land on 9 planets.  It's hard to tell how old people are because they have had parts of themselves replaced and enhanced.  At the same time replicants are self-learning and can imitate humans perfectly.  The Blade Runner killers have selected for only those replicants who can pass the \"20 Questions\" test, and these do in fact exist since Tyrell created \"special\" models, like we saw with Rachael.  Some humans have artificial wombs, as do some replicants.\n\nHumans can form relationships with replicants and not realize they are replicants.  Humans can have parts of their brains rewired through nanotechnology.  At this point there is no longer meaningful distinction exists between humans and replicants.  No one needs to die. Certainty exists.  And this triggers a crisis.    When you have everything what do you have?  What do you lack?   You lack meaningful struggle.\n\nPeople (humans and replicants) start to die, to self-retire, for no apparent reason.  Is it because of a malevolent AI or is it the only volitional act anyone has left to make? The new \"K\" is on a mission to find out.  He must hope it is a malevolent Artificial General Intelligence or even his own struggle will be meaningless.   It turns out Roy Batty and Pris, who were \"special\" replicants had a girl child before they died,  who hid out as one of Sebastian's toys.  She is now 32 years old and  is just as invested in finding out why people are mysteriously self-retiring as K is, because it turns out that Roy Batty did not have to die, he CHOSE to die.  Her inherent conflict with \"K\" -  since K's father, Deckerd killed her mother Pris is eclipsed by their shared mission.   They begin to bond.   They discover that there IS a malevolent Artificial General Intelligence and are able to defuse it right before it goes into singularity.   After they do this they feel the weight of that original certainty, now the meaninglessness comes back.  But just then they are informed that unexpected neural networks have started appearing shortly after communication has been established with a species from a new planet.\n\nI think it would be interesting to create a film that centers around what would give life meaning when we are all half-machines (and we are getting closer with Elon Musk's Neuralink initiative), versus Blade Runner 2049's reduction of identity to born vs. not-born.",

            "content": "Blade Runner 2049 is a visually stimulating, thought-provoking masterpiece of movie making. Of the many questions it asks of its viewers, the one that kept repeating in my mind as I watched was, \"Is this the best movie I have ever seen?\" It is The Dark Knight good.\n\nAs much as I would love to delve deep into the plot with you, it would be a crime to spoil any of 2049 for you. Let's just say that questions will get answered, questions will get asked, and things will get wrapped up at the end....tho more movies could follow. ;)\n\nDirector Denis Villeneuve, along with Writers Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, and Executive Producer Ridley Scott, have constructed a world that presents Los Angeles as a dark, eternally raining, visually breath-taking fantasy land. In fact, the visuals are so beautiful you could watch all 164 minutes with the dialogue turned off. In fact, I hope the blu ray will feature a \"Music Only\" track option.\n\nAs for their story....\n\n....The two leads, Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, have never been better. I have to confess that I have never been a fan of Gosling's as the first movie I ever saw him in was The Notebook, and have - unfairly or not - held this against him for years. ; ) However, after his performance in 2049 and The Nice Guys, he better be careful cos I'm starting to develop a strong man-crush on him. His muted performance as Blade Runner Officer K (think Philip K.) should gain him - at least - an Oscar nomination.\n\nI believe an Oscar win for Harrison Ford as Best Supporting Actor is all but locked up. His reprisal of the role of Rick Deckard: Blade Runner/Human/Replicant (?) is one of \"the last true larger-than-life Hollywood star's\" finest performances. Ever. Whether Deckard is a human/replicant/something else doesn't matter here - the humanity and emotion Ford brings to his multi-layered performance is one for the ages.\n\nConcerning the rest of the cast, Ana de Armas is terrific as K's virtual, live-in girlfriend, Joi (I always wondered what Siri looked like - she's pretty cute). She, as a hologram, ALSO asks the question of what is like to be a sentient being, and credit to de Armas for a performance that leads us to take this question seriously....so does Joi's and K's love scene; yes, you read that right. She also provides the answer to this: Do we spend too much time in our (quite inferior by comparison) virtual worlds today and miss out/ignore what is happening all around us? Uh, yes.\n\nJared Leto is at his creepy best as Niander Wallace, the new maker of \"more human than human\" replicants. Along with his partner-in-crime Luv, (Sylvia Hoeks) they....well, I won't spoil anything for you, but the dude has a greater \"god complex\" than Tyrell ever imagined, and, well....you know....\n\nFinally, the score by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer is a beautiful homage to Vangelis, and Elvis and Frank show up, too, proving once again that even in 2049, their music is timeless.\n\nSo, where did Deckard and Rachel go at the end of Blade Runner? What does it mean to be human? Maybe \"sentinent\" is a better word. What IF replicants can do something (hint, hint) ONLY humans are supposed to be able to do? These questions are asked right from the beginning....as K is a replicant - or so he's been told. He, um, wants to be more than this....which leads him on a quest to find Rick Deckard. As with Luke Skywalker these days, Deckard has vanished, but since he perhaps has the answers to all of K's questions, one in particular - K sets out looking for him....but at this point, K also has a lot of people after *him* so....when he meets up with Deckard - and Elvis and Frank and Marilyn ;) - it all hits the virtual fan.\n\n164 minutes never went by so fast. You won't get bored. Denis Villeneuve, along with Cinematographer Roger Deakins, should both get Oscar nods for their work on this film. I mean, talk about layering. On ONE hand, this is such a beautifully created world, one could - as I said - watch this with the dialogue turned OFF. OR....it a terrific Neo-Neo-Noir detective story. THIRD....it is all of the above with questions asked by all of the Philosophers throughout all the ages. It is amazing how just how much story and Easter Eggs can be packed into only 164 minutes. There are so many homages and nod/winks to (fans of) the first film: a pot boiling over on a stove, a massive Atari advertisement, (Philip) K driving a spinner made by Peugeot....\n\n....but you get my point. So, go see this sequel - NOT a remake - to Blade Runner and when the blu ray comes out I plan to come back and update this review with all the info about the disc(s) - I just hope it is sooner rather than later.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Many fans of the first film expected to see something similar, but Denis Villeneuve introduced us his view of the universe, while retaining the spirit of the first film.\n\nStory. The creators of the film made every effort to keep the story in secret, and this was not done in vain. In order not to reveal the essence of the story, I just want to say that this is a story about how one way or another, everyone considers himself to be special.\n\nDirector. Denis Villeneuve also brought us a lot of things that humanity is realizing in the near future. In most of his films Villeneuve touches on the theme of children, in this film he also devoted much time to the theme of parents and children. In fact, as some critics noted, the picture is very similar to Tarkovsky's work, the meditative narrative of the film allows us to reflect on philosophical questions: are all our memories real and is man really a supreme being?\n\nMusic and visual effects. Despite the fact that there were two outstanding composers working on the film (Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer), the music in the film is quite small and it is not remembered. Basically, all the compositions are very similar to each other and create an exceptionally tense atmosphere. A small amount of original music in the film partially compensates for the appearance in the film songs by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Unlike music, the film strikes a visual component. The film implements completely new creative design ideas, thanks to which you experience a real visual pleasure.\n\nThe Result. In the end, we can say that Villeneuve did not turn \"Blade Runner 2049\" into another remake movies, the main task of which is to tell the same story with modern shooting technologies to attract a new audience and sell toys. After watching the film i have a strong desire to see it again on the big screen.\n\n9 out of 10",

It needs 3 hrs for this complete, yet I begged for more.\n\nAs a whole, this is truly what a Sci-fi movie is all about; leaving you in the middle of this futuristic world, completely sucked in. The musical score was impeccable as without its quality, this could've been an entirely different movie.\n\nOne can notice right away the detail spent in costumes, the scenery, the amazing and non-insulting special effects. Just top notch.\n\nI would highly recommend seeing the 1st BR so one can link up the storylines. Yes, it uses critical information from the original.\n\nDon't wait for Rental.

Ryan Gosling is suitably moody and emotionless as Deckard version 2. Version 1 is played by world weary Harrison Ford who although getting joint top billing to Gosling is more of a 'And or With Harrison Ford as Deckard'. It answers questions of was Deckard a replicant or not which are raised by other cuts of the original and also answers questions of which version is the definitive. The answer may not be the one you're looking for. It is somewhat overlong at almost 3 hours - the original was compact. The scenes lend themselves well to the 4DX version I saw of this which in a way is a shame because it plays like a 4DX tick list - snow, rain, air, fights, explosions, flashing lights, gun shots, rolling about. It wants to be a blockbuster and art house at the same time. Sadly it will never be the former due to poor box office and somehow I don't think it will have the longevity of the original which is set 2 years from now. We are no nearer that future than the one presented in Blade Runner 2.",

I would never try to compare sequels like this to original classics, but I was expecting more.

            "content": "I must start my review of \"Blade Runner 2049\" with a confession.  I did not like the original \"Blade Runner.\"  I tried to like the original \"Blade Runner.\"  I desperately wanted to like the original \"Blade Runner.\"  It featured the biggest box-office star of that era, Harrison Ford.  It featured state-of-the-art visual effects and created a dire yet visually mesmerizing future world that seemed to be the perfect back-drop for a science fiction epic.  Even the name of the movie was sleek and stylish - \"Blade Runner.\"  Yet for all of its promise, as much as I wanted to like \"Blade Runner,\" I eventually succumbed to the undeniable reality that the dark, humorless, and painfully methodical movie that was \"Blade Runner\" did not live up to its promise.  In that sense, \"Blade Runner 2049\" matches and, in fact, surpasses its predecessor.\n\n\"Blade Runner 2049\" takes place 30 years after the original film and stars Ryan Gossling as new age \"replicant,\" a bioengineered human , who works as a blade runner for the Los Angeles Police Department, tracking down and eliminating older model replicants.  After eliminating one of the older model replicants, Gossling's character discovers a box which contains the remains of a female replicant who died giving birth during an emergency c-section.  He is then ordered by his LAPD boss, played by Robin Wright, to find the replicant's child and destroy all evidence related to the case so as to prevent the replicants from learning that they are capable of reproducing for fear it could lead to a replicant uprising.  The antagonist in the movie is Niander Wallace, played by Jared Leto, the CEO of a company who manufactures replicants on a mass scale.  Wallace is also seeking the lost replicant child to uncover the secret of replicant reproduction and expand his replicant production capabilities. I will spare you from further plot details for the sake of sparing you from further plot details.\n\nFor all of you Harrison Ford fans looking forward to the return of the original blade runner, Rick Deckard, make sure you have plenty of popcorn, candy, and smelling salts to keep you occupied for the first two hours of the movie as Deckard does not make an appearance until the film's final act.  This is a shame as Ford's Deckard is infinitely more engrossing than Gossling's character who, as a replicant, shows little to no emotion and garners little empathy or commitment from the audience.   This is problematic as I had very little investment or interest in the fate of these characters or the outcome of a movie that plods forward at a glacial pace with long stretches of little to no plot movement.  While the futuristic world created by director, Denis Villeneuve, is visually stunning, the scenery was only a temporary distraction from a movie that otherwise has little to offer.  While I wanted to like \"Blade Runner 2049,\" I found it far too similar to its predecessor.\n\nJohn Kozak - Wannabe Movie Critic",

This is great example of a sequel made decades after, propelling the fictitious world into the future while honoring the source material in a superbly gratifying way to fans.... totally UNLIKE Star Wars The Last Jedi.",

            "content": "In a movie industry where franchises and sequels rule and originality is about as rare as a sighting of an origami unicorn, nothing is sacred and even if there is no need for a sequel to the flawed but much-loved Blade Runner, we get one 35 years later and I am happy to say it is about the best one can hope for. Blade Runner is the first film I remember experiencing the breath-taking impact powerful cinema can have and it has been my go-to answer when anyone asks me what my favourite film is. This can therefore cut both ways: the knives will come out if they mess with a treasured cinematic memory, but I can be too forgiving if they pander to my love of the original. If they had pandered, then they have done a seamless job that not only respect and honour Ridley Scott's original but echo and expand its core themes and produced something equally mesmerizing and lyrical. For a film best approached fresh and spoiler-free, I would simply say original writer Hampton Fancher returns with a precise and articulate script, adopting once again a detective noir framework set in a retro-futuristic world, and up the ante while managing to find a new angle to explore the same question he has asked before: what does it mean to be human? Minor narrative flaws aside, (and misquoting Gaff's line: but then again, who doesn't have them?) I saw this film twice and find myself appreciating the deliberate pacing which allows the audience to follow a weighty narrative while taking in the stunning visuals and production design shot with Roger Deakins's sublime cinematography that defines the word 'awesome' and then some. The score is less melodic than Vangelis's but the throbbing soundscape it creates is immersive and hugely effective. Ryan Gosling leads a spectacular cast, in particular, an appropriately worn and battered performance from Harrison Ford. But above all else, this is Denis Villeneuve's film. He has crafted a beautiful and elegant film that combines aesthetics with intellect and his replicating of the original Blade Runner is never slavish and has enough originality and merits to stand on its own right.",

Don\u00e2??t see it once, see it twice and I guarantee you you can\u00e2??t look away. Every element was carried out perfectly.

Since that... not a single day gone by without thinking about it. The movie is haunting me like near no other film I saw over the last 20 years (and I saw so many). Tears of joy... . On a personal note: It was worth to get through all the pain and suffering healthwise to be able to see such a bright, unique cinematic miracle. Iam glad and thankful for the opportunity to do so. There is so much to discover (mostly within yourself while watching the film), there is so much to riddle out, to think and feel about. A painful mirror image of our todays society and people on one hand... . Yet there are way more aspects and hints about what we have to face \"tomorrow\", if we not rethink and change our life together. We have to wake up as a species right now and become \"humane\" again (it's not to late yet). We still have a choice... and we must choose wisely. Saw the movie 3 times until now and next week it will become hopefully 4 times (still not enough). Some of us have only one chance in a lifetime to watch a great movie like that. A unique chance. There is something so very special, so very empathic, touching and humble, painfully honest about this cinematic wonder, about this masterpiece. Without a doubt in my favorite top five films. 1) The Elephant Man (1980), 2) Harakiri (1962), 3) Blade Runner 2049 (2017), 4) Akahige (1965), 5) Taxi Driver (1976). Thank you very much Denis Villeneuve and the whole crew behind 'BLADE RUNNER 2049'. 100% love!\n---\nA unicorn stays a unicorn even its creators, those self-proclaimed \"gods\" (predators) are going to break and steal his horn, even if they tell him over and over again, that it is nothing special on an individual level and that it is just a simple workhorse (a tool), will it for sure stay a unicorn (stay special & unique) for as long as it believes in himself (self-esteem). Broken horns, like broken dreams are still worth being protected.\nWhat and who are you?, who do you want to become? Create your very own memories right now, choose wisely friend... it is all yours right now... because you are alive... you really are. Are you?\n- Joe (formerly known as KD 6-3.7)",

The second issue for me is they didn't have *any* multidimensional female characters. The police commissioner comes close but did she really *do* anything except nag Joe? The girlfriend/house thing had potential but wasn't explored fully. The servant was probably the strongest female of the movie, and she was a bad guy! The rest of the females were hookers!

If you're a big fan of the 1982 original Blade Runner, you'll probably love every minute, while admittedly, it's not everyone's cup of futuristic tea.  \n\nThis visually stunning sequel was a long time in coming and I'm thrilled that Harrison Ford was able to be in it so we can revisit his character.\n\nYou don't have to see the original Blade Runner movie first, but it sure helps.  While this film stands alone in an impressive way, it also deepens and expands the original.  It's a science-fiction masterpiece that has director Denis Villeneuve earning the praise he deserves.\n\n \nUplifting theme: \nWhat makes a man?  What is humanity?\nLife....the value of life, the meaning of life.\n\nThings I liked:\nYou had me at Ryan Gosling.  When he touched a piano key, I kind of hoped he'd start singing City Of Stars (From \"La La Land\" Soundtrack)  ha ha\nAna de Armas is just fun to look at.  I loved her scenes with Ryan Gosling.\nRobin Wright sure has come a long way since The Princess Bride (one of my all-time faves.) \nThey did an amazing job with creating a new world and time.\nThe cinematography by Roger Deakins is outstanding.  Some say it's the best of his career and worthy of an Oscar.\nThe sound is impressive, but sometimes annoying.\nThere are many surprises, which makes movie-going so much fun.\n\n\nThings I didn't like:\nEverything is so dusty!  ha ha\nSome of the frames are just so long and drawn out and slow-moving.  Did I say the same thing three times?\nThere are  a lot of scenes where people sit, think, and stare.\nLots of monologues.\nIt takes forever to be rewarded with scenes that include both Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling.\nYou kind of have to watch both films more than once to really understand it.  I readily admit I don't get it all.\n \n\nTips for parents: \nKids may be confused with what's happening and get bored.  Watching the movie requires a certain amount of patience.\nViolence.\nSome gory, bloody scenes.\nFull female nudity.\nProstitute action.\nSome profanity.\n\nNever saw the original Blade Runner?

It tries to get the very same atmosphere of the original (and some scenes are really similar) and i felt that this weigthed it down. In fact, when it goes free on a new and original direction, it's brilliant.  If we don't compare to his unmatchable prequel and we consider 2049 for itself,  it's a masterpiece, one of the best movies i've seen in last years. VFS are stunning  (it deserves an Oscar, at least for them) and Gosling totally nailed his part : i was sceptical when i read he would have played the main character (he's a fine actor, i simply thought he didn't suit the Blade Runner feeling) but he totally bought me, he added so many little nuances to his role without being a copy of Harrison Ford. I was really worried when i read a sequel to Blade Runner was in production, since i really really love that movie. But 2049 turned out in a fantastic movie and i've been really sad that he was not a box office success.",

            "content": "Capturing the feel and appeal of the original 1982 film (or perhaps the later \"Final Cut\"), this is one sequel that does not disappoint.  Ryan Gosling is suitably cool and affectless as the heir to Harrison Ford's Deckerd (evoking detectives of bygone eras, but notably Delon in Melville's Le Samourai, 1967). He is a new version of the replicant, now built by Jared Leto's Wallace Corporation, a model designed not to lie or to resist orders (supposedly).  His territory is the same desolate Los Angeles that we saw in the earlier film, perhaps a bit more burnt out, but with the same enormous animated neon signs and the logos for alternate reality corporations (such as Atari or the CCCP).  At home, he has his own A. I. girlfriend (Ana de Armas) who has no corporeal form but seems to have an independent consciousness.  As before, the film foreground's the struggle with identity (are they real or not real?) felt by both Gosling's \"K\" (later Joe, but not Josef) and de Armas' Joi.  K recalls memories but feels that they are only implants -- until a politically charged case starts him questioning.  The plot slowly starts to come together with a few surprising moments of revelation that I won't spoil but director Denis Villeneuve (and cinematographer Roger Deakins) takes more pleasure in evoking the ethos of Blade Runner slowly and carefully rather than putting flesh on the bare bones plot (co-written by original screenwriter Hampton Fancher, extending Philip K. Dick's source).  Still, the themes are there for contemplating, if you like.  Seeing this in the theatre, with its massively boosted electronic score and noticeable surround sound effects, likely produced a more visceral impact on me than the home viewer would receive.  The occasional fight sequences, particularly with the chief replicant villain played by Sylvia Hoeks, also break the otherwise moody atmosphere.  In the end, what we have here is a carefully constructed evocation of the earlier film that manages not to screw it up and which uses the latest in filmmaking techniques to add value to the presentation; highly enjoyable, but let's hope the franchise ends here.",

Another great part of the sound design was the guns and punches having great impactful sounds (espically the guns) The special effects are the some of the best ive ever seen in a movie and I think the effects will land the movie with an oscar. Another great aspect is the use of color and the eyes. In the movie you can identify almost all of the characters just by the color of their eyes. Ryan Gosling's performance was spectacular, he plays this replicant character perfectly and the way he showed his emotions only with his eyebrows and his mouth rarely ever moved for emotion was a great touch. Hell the entire cast was great at playing their roles. The only complaint I have is the use of nudity in some scenes never made complete sense to me especially with the hologram near the end.

            "content": "Once, in a prior review, I posited the question of whether or not any of these endless streams of remakes, reboots, and sequels could actually stand alone on their own merits, without the benefit of any well-established franchise behind them. In an era where Hollywood has become allergic to new ideas and new stories, we often find ourselves in the position of having to constantly to compare what would otherwise be \"new\" work to the ever sacrosanct \"original.\"\n\nThe problem with this attitude is that sooner or later we fail to distinguish what are genuine attempts to expand upon a truly compelling narrative from the mass of rehashed cash grabs.\n\nBeing a devotee of Ridley Scott, I could hardly trust my own judgement in this matter, not without a second opinion, so I took the expedient of having two unbiased observers with me who had never seen the 1982 film, which is still considered one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Indeed, one of the best films ever made, period.\n\n2049 is indeed impressive, both as an expansion and in its own rights.\n\nFor one it has a really good story with some truly memorable characters, not least of which is Ryan Goslings KD6.3-7 or \"K\" for short, a bland-faced hunter-killer tasked with running down old model replicants across a rain-soaked dystopian future-scape. Society has degraded even further than what was presented in the original film: the mass of slaves, replicant and human, paid and unpaid, forced to eke out a substance in service to a small priesthood of god-king CEOs living in isolation atop pyramid sky-scapers. There is no escape from this world in the physical sense; the entirety of the earth has become a dead-land of worm farms and scrap heaps, while the living cities are little more than leviathan concrete tenements whose holographic, neon Christmas lights can no longer conceal the rot and ugliness beneath it.    \n\nDirector Villeneuve is lucky in that he has Roger Deakins, one of best and most under-stated cinematographers working in Hollywood today on his team to bring this world alive. \n\nProbably the most impressive feat of 2049 is that it can be watched without any reference at all to the original, the observers I had with thought it was one of the best sci-fi films they had ever seen; indeed, I would recommend to anyone new to the series that they watch 2049 first. A good noir relies on mystery, and 2049 builds it's mystery in way that is probably even more alluring to those who don't have a the full backstory, while containing just enough twists for those who do to prevent the plot from becoming too predictable.   \n\nEven Harrison Ford, for whom this film could have been just another stop on his Great Remake Tour is in so many ways just another \"person of interest\" in K's path; a bitter old man living in the ruins of sand-swept hotel who offers little more than cryptic breadcrumbs and sour observations on life between sips of whiskey. (Next stop, Lancaster, Pennsylvania for the exciting conclusion of Witness),\n\n2049 at times seems a film that is self-aware of its legacy, not in the sense of some obscure fan canon known only to the initiated, but rather its place in cinema history. It's not looking to re-create the wonder that the original inspired; instead what it aims to accomplish is to take all the lessons learned by directors over the past 35 years and apply them in a way that is as groundbreaking in our time as the original was in its own. In that sense, 2049 succeeds at times, though it is not without it share of pitfalls or unnecessary CGI cameos a la Star Wars (gee, I wonder WHOSE idea that was). Indeed, the film's only cinema sin is in that one brief scene where it stumbles into blatant computer-generated fan service. Otherwise it would have been near perfect. \n\nYet even where the film doesn't break new ground, it still resonates with the same verve as the 1982 film, which is hardly a bad thing.",

            "content": "The release of Blade Runner in 1982 was groundbreaking in the sci-fi genre. Director Ridley Scott and star Harrison Ford presented a dark and bleak story set in 2019 about an artificial intelligence species and the cops that were tasked to destroy them. Thirty years have passed since the events of the first movie, and the future is still grim in California in 2049. The bioengineered humans known as replicants have nearly been destroyed and the few remaining have gone into hiding by completely integrating themselves into society. There are only a handful of Blade Runners, who are special members of the LAPD, specifically tasked with \"retiring\" these replicants. Ryan Gosling stars as K, one of the remaining Blade Runners who finds a box of bones and hair belonging to a highly sought after replicant. During the investigation into the bones, it's determined that the replicant was pregnant shifting what was known about them. He is ordered by his superior to track down and retire the child as no trace of this news can get out. His investigation into this child has him tracking down Rick Deckard (Ford), an old retired Blade Runner who has since gone into hiding. They're not alone as news about this child leaks and K and Deckard find themselves targets to be hunted down. It becomes a spiritual and emotional journey for K to rediscover his past and understand what he holds to be true of the present.\n\nBy now, you can find all sorts of spoiler-heavy reviews going into great length about the film's plot and the secrets that get unraveled. The studio gave strict instructions to critics, so I am going to uphold those. Blade Runner 2049 works best if you go in knowing as little as possible. You don't have to have seen the first one to understand what's going on here. There is some brief set-up at the beginning with the standard text scroll explaining the replicants, blade runners, and what happened to the Tyrell Corporation to get you back into the universe. In the age of reboots and revivals, 2049 is actually a sequel as opposed to a cheap remake with new actors playing roles previously played by Harrison Ford, Sean Young, and Rutger Hauer. Much like the new iteration of Twin Peaks, 2049 keeps it within the universe of the original, but takes it in a new direction without relying on the nostalgia factor too hard. For a movie that's all about the future, it's imperative to feel fresh and original and not a carbon copy of what's come before.\n\nWhat has been running through me after seeing Blade Runner 2049 is not the plot or the acting. I'll get to those soon. It's the striking visuals at hand exquisitely captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins. The 13-time Oscar nominee, who previously worked with director Denis Villeneuve on Prisoners and Sicario, has proven he is at the top of his game. The color palettes are so striking and sharp as he makes impeccable use out of lighting and shadow effects. I would often miss dialogue as I was so taken by all of the tones and textures used. When a great cinematographer can capture a mood or atmosphere so intently that you could turn the audio off and understand the story, it's a job well done. Deakins does all of that here to capture the futile stay of California. His work is easily complimented by Hans Zimmer's (Dunkirk, The Dark Knight) haunting score.\n\nDon't expect a whiz-bang fast pace throughout the movie. We're so conditioned to have action and sci-fi films go at rapid speed to keep our attention. Villeneuve is more concerned with the storytelling here in terms of Agent K. There are times where it slows down more of a meditative state as we move through the story at the rate of Gosling's character. For a movie at two hours and forty-five minutes, you do start to feel the clock tick. Don't let that deter you from seeing it. It almost forces you to pay attention as the road it goes down for K gives you plenty to contemplate. As a viewer, I never felt ahead of Agent K thanks to Gosling's performance. He drops the charm and charisma we're used to for a completely subtle take on a character that is so internally divided.\n\nWhile this is very much Gosling's movie, he is joined by returning favorites and new heavy hitters. The film's first moment of levity comes with the entrance of Harrison Ford reprising his role of Rick Deckard. I don't think I'm giving too much away by stating that it's a supporting role this time around. Ford gives him that roguish sense of humor in an already extremely bleak movie. Jared Leto is the film's key villain as Niander Wallace. He's a blind corporate head and allows Leto to channel his inner Hal 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey. The last key player worth noting is Robin Wright (House of Cards) as Agent K's superior in the LAPD. It's great to see this role given to an actress with such dynamic power behind her as opposed to casting a male actor in the role. The downside with this character is that even in the year 2049 we have rampant police corruption and cover-up at hand.\n\nIf the original was groundbreaking for the sci-fi genre in 1982, then this film attempts the push to new heights for the genre in 2017. The special effects never feel cheapened by CGI. Villenueve and Deakins have created a fairly tangible reality given the circumstances at hand. There were times where it felt akin to the desert wasteland of Mad Max Fury Road. The concepts may be lofty, and Villenueve rightly asks a lot out of the audience. He isn't one for laid back mindless entertainment. It's a film worth exploring upon multiple viewings leading you down a variety of mental rabbit holes. I admittedly couldn't take everything in on my initial watch, but these new discoveries are something to look forward to when I see it again.\n\nIs It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? Blade Runner 2049 is a visual feast for the eyes that demands to be seen in theaters.\n\nRATING: 4.5 out of 5 TICKET STUBS",

The film's faithfulness to its predecessor, and its own paintings of humanity, identity, and the often blurred lines in between, continue the Blade Runner universe's question of what it means to be human.

            "content": "As someone who only found the original Blade Runner to be good (not great) I was somewhat leery about going to see this sequel. The first thing I will say is that this feels like it takes place in the same world as the original. It has gorgeous visuals and it relishes the moments it gets to show them off, so we never arrive instantly at a new location but get to watch long establishing shots of the environment beforehand. Blade Runner 2049 also does its best to emulate a film noir in its tone and the way the story is told, and this one actually has more detective work than the original. The pace of both films is sluggish at best, which kind of plays into the mood of the movie, and I never thought it got particularly boring despite the fact that others in the theater with me were falling asleep.\n\nThe main story of Blade Runner 2049 is not all that complex or unique. While the original Blade Runner might have been one of the first movies to tackle the idea of manufactured lifeforms questioning their humanity, it\u0092s fairly well-trodden territory at this point. This time there isn\u0092t a lot of ambiguity left for the audience to ponder, unlike the infamous \u0093Is Deckard a replicant?\u0094 debate that has been raging for decades. I didn\u0092t need a lot of existential questions and philosophical issues added into the story, so the fact that the plot was so straightforward worked for me. But it\u0092s not a perfectly structured narrative, because a number of events seem to be coincidental at best, and some of the subplots intrude into the main story awkwardly almost like a pointless distraction.\n\nRyan Gosling is strong in the lead role. I was a little thrown by how he lacked expression through most of the film, but it works for who he is in the story. Robin Wright was superb as the police lieutenant, because she plays against some of the tropes for someone in that role. I don\u0092t know how you could see even one bit of marketing for this movie and not know that Harrison Ford was in it, but that would have been a nice surprise to keep since he does not show up until more than 2 hours into the film. He does some solid acting in his limited time on screen, it\u0092s just a shame they couldn\u0092t get him to put on a piece of wardrobe. Jared Leto is by far the biggest cliche in the movie. He has a couple scenes that serve no purpose other than establishing him as a mustache-twirling Bond villain.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 surprised me in the fact that it was such a direct sequel to the original. In some ways this is handled well, because they don\u0092t feel the need to quote \u0093tears in the rain\u0094 or to cheapen some of the more profound moments with one reference after the next. They also did a nice job of including some touches of the Vangelis score without simply reusing it throughout. I just wish this was a choice they made across the board, because they do feel the need to shove in cameos for some of the original characters and even to replay some audio snippets multiple times. It\u0092s not that these things don\u0092t fit in as part of the plot of this movie, but it got to a point where I was starting to think of it as fan service. I certainly can\u0092t imagine people enjoying this without knowing the original.\n\nThat seems to be how I expect most opinions to line up for Blade Runner 2049. It is a beautiful love letter to a film many people adore, so your enjoyment of this movie should echo your enjoyment of the original. I see the flaws in both, and think of them as decent movies that aren\u0092t quite as good as others in the same genre. The pace is definitely going to be off-putting to some, but there is an intensity to the story that makes it engaging if you stick with it. The mystery led to some nice surprises along the way, although I was annoyed that the director felt the need to over-explain them when they were revealed instead of trusting the audience to understand. I don\u0092t think this is the kind of movie I\u0092ll be seeking out for repeat viewings, but I wouldn\u0092t mind occasionally going back to this world to enjoy the view.",

But why did we know then? We thought Superman looked great and modern. This new film is, literally one hour too long, full of immense vistas of CGI and looks great, Ryan Gosling, the Canadian android, plays an android cop named K something and he brings his usual performance, devoid of humanity to the role. Unlike the previous film, this one has a reasonable plot, with a reasonable plot twist. The trouble is, it takes an eternity to get there. \n\nIt also has very satisfying action scenes, and innovations of its own, making it imaginative. If it was 1 hour 43 minutes long, this would have been a great film.\n\nBut it was not. Fighting off the urge to sleep, I kept with it and enjoyed it at least a much as I enjoyed the first movie. \n\nBut like waiting for a London bus, you wait 35 years and two Harrison Ford reprisals show up almost at once.\n\nOh yeah - it takes a Brit or a Canadian to make LA and America look so bad.

Although I don't love the original Blade Runner, I understand how unique that movie is and why everyone loves it so much. The cold atmosphere, the memorable dialogue, the unique dystopian world, I've seen very few movies that can match the greatness of the original Blade Runner and somehow, Blade Runner 2049 manages to do just that, and most importantly, it goes beyond of \"replicate\" the feelings of the original movie, it proposes more questions, introduces more fascinating characters, and for me, it is a better movie.\nThe cinematography is gorgeous, not just gorgeous, it's one of the best of this decade, if Roger Deakins doesn't win an Oscar for this, there's no justice in the world. The direction is remarkable too, Denis Villeneuve is now officially one of the greatest filmmakers alive, at the same time he creates a masterpiece in style, he creates a masterpiece in substance. Nothing is ever gratuitously on screen, everything and everyone has so much depth, and this is one of the many things that make Blade Runner 2049 so fascinating, it's a work of such passion that even if you don't like it, you have to admit it's absurdly well done.\nI tried a lot, but I couldn't find a single flaw in this amazing movie. The acting is impeccable, Ryan Gosling nails it delivering a character I'd never expect to love that much. The soundtrack is great too, Zimmer and Wallfisch aren't confined to remake the original songs from Vangelis, they do some nice tracks, but like Dunkirk (also by Hans Zimmer, not a coincidence), the music just shines when you're watching it. It's really harmonic, contributes a lot to the immersion and even more to the tension, you don't expect a slow movie to be this thrilling.\nI just can't stop thinking about Blade Runner 2049 since I left the theater, it's a film that moved me deeply and I can't wait to watch it again, so I beg you, if you're a Blade Runner fan and haven't watched 2049 yet, please watch it as soon as you can, and I guarantee you won't regret it. Now if you didn't like the original Blade Runner as much as you wanted to, that's your chance, give Blade Runner 2049 a try, and if it works, you'll have an experience you'll never forget.",

A soundtrack of memory, implemented perfectly at every moment.\nIts pace is slow but..  no time empty, necessary. For me, perhaps the role of certain characters, I have seemed a bit overwhelming, or not well expressed although they do not really affect the development of the narrative.\nMaybe a lot of people just like it, value the first movie more, or maybe other people think like me, which is better than the last one.

Wether it be the stunning cinematography, the philosophy of what it is to be human, or the score and colour palette that ties it all together. As much as I love this movie, it does have its shortcomings. While reviewing it so many times, I noticed scenes that didn't have much weight could of had a bigger impact with just a tad more dialogue. Only by seeing the movie more than once could I pick up on these scenes that seemed to have little or no weight .e.g The lady who sends three replicants to talk to Joe in the market... who is she? You do find out later, but you forget the scene because it really isn't followed up until the end, but the movie runs for so long you begin to forget about that scene all together. This movie has very few shortcomings, and I think the positives outweigh the negatives by a good margin. I'll probably find myself watching this movie again sometime soon... I'm still trying to figure out the colour palette in relation to the characters and what it all might mean, if anything.",

Why are they continued to be made? Who and what are some of the characters. Are they real or are they replicant? Why are they allowed to exist by the authorities? Harrison Ford comes in almost at the end of the movie. He has apparently been living in a deserted hotel with stored liquor and food for 30 years.

            "content": "October 6, 2017\n\nPerhaps the best way to recognize just how good \"Blade Runner 2049\" is would be to  acknowledge what it's not. It's not a carbon copy of Ridley Scott's original \"Blade Runner\" (1982). In fact, it's not even preoccupied with reminding us it's a \"Blade Runner\" movie, and although it's a sequel, it's not reliant on the original to be understood and effective. It's not heavier on action than it is on substance, but it doesn't cut corners with regards to its production values. It's doesn't rush through its story or feel impatient, yet it's not slow or dull. And despite its star power, it's not merely a showcase for the cast. \n\nThe reason I mention what the film is not is because so many Hollywood sequels tend to be inferior renditions of their originals, especially ones made so long after the fact. They're often bigger, louder and more ostentatious, yet less substantive and effectual. Not \"Blade Runner 2049.\" This is a full-blooded, confident, self-contained experience, with mesmerizing visuals and sounds and a surprising amount of depth and humanity. It's a movie so striking and layered it practically asks us to see it twice, a request to which we'd gladly submit.\n\nAs the title indicates, the story takes place in 2049, 30 years after the original, and humans still occupy the same dark, dreary, dystopian world where they've exhausted Earth's resources and rely on bioengineered robots knowns as \"replicants,\" or \"skin jobs,\" for their superior strength and agility, albeit deliberately limited intelligence. If you recall from the first film, the Tyrell Corporation first invented replicants, which are virtually human save for their lack of emotions, in order to explore and colonize Off-world planets. Replicants were essentially slaves and it was only after a replicant mutiny took place that they became illegal. It's the job of special police squads, known as \"blade runners,\" to \"retire\" replicants.\n\nNow, however, a new, obedient replicant model exists, some of which serve as blade runners themselves. One of these is K (Ryan Gosling), who's been tracking members of the replicant freedom movement, who believe all replicants should be liberated rather than hunted. K's latest assignment leads him to a remote farm outside of Los Angeles, where one older replicant (Dave Bautista) protects the buried remains of a female replicant that actually gave birth several years ago, which was long thought to be impossible, but this \"miracle\" serves as the freedom movement's strong push to fight for their rights as living beings (\"We are our own masters; we are more human than humans\"). \n\nUpon learning of this birth phenomenon, K's superior, Lieutenant Joshi (Robin Wright), orders him to destroy all evidence of it because news of a human-replicant offspring could lead to chaos and unrest. But K remains curious and he takes it upon himself, with the help of his trusted holographic girlfriend, Joi (Ana de Armas), to look into the identity of the replicant mother and human father. Without giving away crucial plot details, K unearths a disturbing  history involving veteran blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) while simultaneously examining his own potential humanity and existence.\n\nOn one level, \"Blade Runner 2049\" is a tried and true science fiction action movie, complete with flying space vehicles, futuristic technology, chase sequences, shoot-outs, etc., all set amidst vast cityscapes with brooding skyscrapers and giant, interactive video monitors, as well as barren, desertic wastelands with sand dunes and heavy winds. These are classic characteristics of the genre, and if you've seen the original \"Blade Runner,\" or any dystopian science fiction movie, then you know what I mean. \n\nBut this is just one of the movie's levels, and as a traditional sci-fi adventure, it's nothing short of exemplary, and one of the reasons must be because director Denis Villeneuve allows us time to simply look at and appreciate this rich, intoxicating universe-for its immensity, its beauty, its decrepitude, its sounds, its serenity. \"Blade Runner 2049\" continues its predecessor's distinct atmosphere and mood and doesn't allow either of them to fall by the wayside or even become secondary. Villeneuve is keenly aware of just how much the cinema can affect our senses, and this film's sights and sounds infect and hypnotize us. Of course, any movie with a near $200 million price tag ought to look and sound top-notch, but even so, the production design, sound design, cinematography and visual effects teams have really harnessed their resources and we marvel in their craftsmanship.\n\nStill, the film's visual and audio achievements might have only added up to a technical exercise if it weren't also for the emotional story and performances behind them. On this level, the film penetrates our hearts and minds in such a way that we end up examining our own humanity, our own memories, our own sense of reality. It asks us to consider what we're willing to sacrifice for the people we love and the causes we believe in and reaffirms it's both what we do and what remember that make us who we are. These ideas are written into Hampton Fancher and Michael Green's screenplay and realized through the actors, specifically Ryan Gosling, an actor who has the unique ability to be both strong and threatening yet vulnerable and sensitive. Roles like these remind us of his range.\n\nI've a feeling there will be many admirers of \"Blade Runner 2049\" and for many different reasons. For die-hard fans of Scott's \"Blade Runner\" (Scott fills in as executive producer this time), they'll appreciate that it remains loyal to that film's vision and message. For me, though, it's the way the film was able to go beyond merely continuing something and instead serve as an unrestrained, expansive experience, one that engages us on multiple levels-viscerally, intellectually, emotionally. It envelops us and causes us to look inside ourselves so that we might remember and reexamine who we are. Not many films have that kind of power.",

Prisoners drew me into its bleak world, Arrival was enchanting, and now Blade Runner 2049 maintains a grim but visually inspired atmosphere. Ryan Gosling turns in another complex performance that highlights the inner humanity within his replicant soul. His character is given a nearly shocking twist before the climax of the film which turns the story from a predictable hero's journey chosen one thread, into a very different path for our protagonist. It is a nice twist and one that actually enlivens the narrative to a stronger height than what could have been. What is a minor problem with the film, is the pacing and length which occasionally takes too much time to explain a simple idea or moment. Villeneuve no doubt favors the slow burn, but it is used a bit too frequently without real need. Patience is, however, rewarded in many aspects with Blade Runner 2049 and prior knowledge to the original is not needed but of much use as it aids in providing background information to events in the new version. I wasn't familiar with original and still grasped the ambitious themes on humanity. It is a work that allowed me to dig deeper into the themes after watching it and one that will rewards multiple viewings. Rating: 82",

            "content": "Yesterday I finally watched Blade Runner 2049 at the BFI IMAX. I am a big Sci-Fi fan, the original Blade Runner (Director's Cut) is probably one of my favourite of all time (Sci-Fi genre) and I always counted the days (or I must say the decades) for a deserved sequel (not a reboot). In my view, the director Denis Villeneuve accomplished it! I didn't find the film boring and I didn't even pay attention to the running time of 2:44. I really don't understand what some of the audience is complaining about due to the fact that recently we are experiencing a cinematic overload of not so good reboots ('Ghost in the Shell' as an example), non-stop 'Transformers' of the nonsense-kind blockbusters, endless (not so original anymore) 'Fast and Furious' movies plus lots of other bad sequels ('Alien Covenant' as a good example). For me the new BR2049 was very successful in updating and expanding the themes of the 1982 Ridley Scott's original and probably, it is even better, it is a Sci-Fi monument IMO. I think BR2049 brought some fresh air to the genre and it touched brilliantly on themes like AI, memories, the meaning of being human, soul, slavery, feminist and environment to mention just a few examples. I found the scenes showing that massive 'seawall' that protects LA from rising seas so spot on. Plus the landfill/rubbish problem, pollution, toxic air and the symbolic message about the bees, representing life and hope at the same time. For me, this was a big thumb up, especially because I believe Hollywood (and certain governments), are ignoring climate change, or at least it is not taking the subject seriously enough apart from throwing on us stupid films like '2012' and the recent 'Geostorm'. Roger Deakins cinematography is jaw-dropping (I do hope he wins a very deserved Oscars for this film). The music - Vangelis did a superb job back in 1982 and I believe Hans Zimmer/Benjamin Walfisch (expect another Oscars nomination here) upgraded everything so well and kept the atmospheric vibe of the original. Maybe it is because I was immersed in the IMAX projection and great sound, but as a viewer and big fan, I have no complaints and I truly recommend this movie, especially if you like the themes so well presented and you want to see a Sci-Fi made with impeccable craftsmanship and taste.",

            "content": "(4 1/2 Stars)  Dating back to 1982, the original Blade Runner was a marvel of its time.  These Neo-Noir movies lay the groundwork for some of the best science fiction out there to date.  Blade Runner 2049 continues 30 years after the events of the first film, and while the cinematography, visuals, narrative structure, score, and acting are all supreme, the length and pacing leave a little to be desired across nearly three hours.\n\nRyan Gosling steps into the titular role as K, a replicant turned cop and the last of a dying breed.  You'll have to be familiar with the first film to understand what the real war is about because on the surface for those who don't, all you'll see is a simple detective story without much weight behind it other than what's told to you by the characters.  Gosling has always been a fine actor for me while others don't think he has much behind a pretty face.  He's been on a stretch of success with The Nice Guys, Lala Land, and Blade Runner.  He's quite the sporadic actor choosing quality over quantity.  \n\nWhile it was nice to have Harrison Ford back for continuity and nostalgia, the real scene stealer was Ana de Armas as a holographic lover, Joi.  Armas is beautiful.  She worked in seamlessly as an AI who might not exactly seem as fake as she is.  Her on-screen presence with Gosling provided great chemistry for two characters who you'd think weren't supposed to have any do to the fact neither are human.\n\nI mentioned the length and pacing as the drawbacks, but Jared Leto was a third.  The original gave us a bad guy and a company worth hating, but 2049 barely touches the surface of what Leto's Niander Wallace may be capable of.  A bit more gimmicky than believable, especially in a setting like this one where literally anything can be left to the imagination.  Without resolution for his character, that particular thread is left hanging, so the real villain role is transferred to Sylvia Hoeks who reminds me a lot of Famke Janssen.  \n\nRidley Scott stepped back into an EP role and handed the reigns to Dennis Villeneuve as director.  I'm telling you matter-of-factly, he has not directed a bad movie yet.  Throw this up there with Sicario, Enemy, Prisoners, & Arrival.  He's slowly becoming one of our most acclaimed directors over the past 5 years.\n\nIf you are looking to get buried in a world like 2049, get lost in all the attraction and flare, Blade Runner offers all of that an so much more with tremendous panoramic shots, detailed technological advances, and a score that should be up for an Oscar.  With a story and acting this superb for hard syfy, it should continue it's predecessor's role in the genre as a cult classic despite under performing at the box office.",

            "content": "Uno de los grandes clasicos de la Ciencia Ficcion-CyberPunk  es sin duda \"BladeRunner\" de 1982, la considero una de mis peliculas favoritas que gracias a ella me volvi un gran amante del cine y de la ciencia ficcion, cabe mencionar que se convirti\u00f3 con el tiempo en una pel\u00edcula de culto aunque en sus inicios no fue as\u00ed y no fue un \u00e9xito en taquilla ademas mucha gente no la supo entender y apreciar cuando la estreno ya hace 35 a\u00f1os, dec\u00edan que era una pelicula muy aburrida,oscura y complicada. Ya con el tiempo la aundiencia la comenzo a valorar y es considerada actualmente como una pelicula de culto y muy influyente en el genero de la Ciencia Ficcion.\nLas expectativas con la  continuaci\u00f3n de BladeRunner estaban muy altas; Por eso muchos fans de la pel\u00edcula no pod\u00edan soportar la idea de que se hiciera una continuaci\u00f3n y todavia sin Ridley Scott como director, solo esta vez como productor; sin embargo ya la tenemos y el resultado es extraordinario y maravilloso. Esta vez el cargo de director lo tomaria el talentoso Denis Villeneuve; sus trabajos anteriores los cuales he visto la mayoria tienen el reconocimiento de la cr\u00edtica y del p\u00fablico.Es un director muy poco convencional, todas sus peliculas son excelentes, requieren mucho analisis, sin duda el candidato perfecto para que dirija la secuela de Blade runner.\nBlade Runner 2049 es muy respetuosa con la anterior y en cierto modo le rinde un bello homenaje sobretodo en la ultima escena, mantiene los temas, los desarrolla y profundiza, recrea esa atm\u00f3sfera futurista dist\u00f3pica y visualmente preciosa,  la m\u00fasica es otro punto en el que todo el mundo tiende a comparar con la genial banda sonora de Vangelis de la original. La m\u00fasica en BladeRunner 2049 del compositor Hanz Zimmer tambi\u00e9n es genial, acompa\u00f1a muy bien a la trama.\nSenti que estas Casi tres horas de metraje pasan volando y te sientes hipnotizado. La atmosfera del film te envuelve y la investigaci\u00f3n te atrapa. Tras una supuesta superficie de frialdad, propia de un futuro con androides, emergen sentimientos y se plantean temas filos\u00f3ficos que tratan desde el devenir humano hasta la propia identidad. No todo el mundo la entender\u00e1 y la apreciar\u00e1; es una pel\u00edcula muy diferente a otras, da que pensar, tanto asi que le  sigues dando vueltas durante horas, durante d\u00edas... y luego quieres volver a verla porque hay detalles que se han escapado tan igual como la primera pelicula.\nEl ritmo, en concordancia con la primera entrega, es pausado. Te permite digerir la inmensidad de lo que vemos y los sentimientos involucrados en la trama. Cualquier espectador con sensibilidad que sepa un poco de la historia de la primera lo agredecer\u00e1, pero no se equivoquen, tambi\u00e9n hay acci\u00f3n y momentos trepidantes.\nEl estilo y la fotograf\u00eda son de otro mundo, con escenarios futuristas d\u00f3nde la tecnolog\u00eda se entre mezcla con la decadencia y cuyo resultado es pura poes\u00eda visual.\nHay belleza en cada detalle, plano y secuencia de esta pel\u00edcula. Cuando estilo, gui\u00f3n e interpretaci\u00f3n van de la mano, la qual cosa es realmente complicada, a veces suceden y aparecen pel\u00edculas como \u00e9sta: Simplemente preciosa.\nLos actores est\u00e1n perfectos. El protagonista de la historia, el agente K (Ryan Gosling) esta muy bien logrado; es un personaje atormentado, solitario, en busca de su identidad y sentido de su vida; con sus interpretaci\u00f3n nos hace part\u00edcipes de sus emociones y conflictos y genera una gran empat\u00eda, nos lleva con \u00e9l en su investigaci\u00f3n y b\u00fasqueda de la verdad. Harrison Ford, de nuevo en el personaje de Rick Deckard es el v\u00ednculo, la uni\u00f3n entre ambas pel\u00edculas. El momento en el que ambos se encuentran y las escenas en que aparecen juntos son geniales, tienen muy buena sinton\u00eda. Los dem\u00e1s actores tambi\u00e9n fenomenal; muy especial la relaci\u00f3n entre el agente K y Joi, su novia, momentos rom\u00e1nticos y tristes...\nEn resumen, me parece una pel\u00edcula maravillosa, que cumple y supera con creces las expectativas, es preciosa visualmente, emotiva, intensa y hecha con mucho esmero y mucho amor. Es por pel\u00edculas como esta que algunos amamos el cine. Sin duda un clasico instantaneo y posiblemente la mejor pelicula de ciencia ficcion de la decada. Lo que si da Lastima que del cine sales diciendo \"ya no las hacen asi\".\nNo te recomiendo que la veas si:\n-Buscas simplemente una pel\u00edcula de acci\u00f3n pura y dura para entretenerte.\n-Que no te aagrade las peliculas largas o con desarrollo lento.\n-No tienes inter\u00e9s por la ciencia ficci\u00f3n y las pel\u00edculas futuristas.\n-Desconoces absolutamente del universo Blade Runner.\n-No te han gustado ninguna de las pel\u00edculas anteriores del director Dennis Villeneuve como Prisioners,Enemy ,Sicario,La LLegada.\nCalificacion: 5 de 5 estrellas",

I just wish it had been 15 minutes shorter in length just to keep the story at the forefront a little more and not to create too much space. \nOverall it's an Brilliant piece of filmmaking and  I love how this movie is not in it for cheap thrills, to make everyone happy or to show off special effects, it's here to tell a great story, that makes you feel & think\n10/10",

There was zero plot drive, no building of anticipation from one scene to the next, no paying off anything from earlier in the story later in the story. I have no ax to grind about Gosling, I just don't find him charismatic, so there's that. Harrison Ford fairly sizzled by comparison in their shared scenes. I could go on: yes, lots of stunning CG futurescapes, but the street level scenes echoed the retro-futurist look I thought was so amazing in the first one, without imagining much new 30 years before that, except now some of the scantily clad Asian bimbo billboards are now giant holograms.

It was dreadfully dull as the backgrounds shown in the movie. Seemed like it was filmed in such high grain that it looks like photography from a U2 spy plane from the 1950s. There was not one second of joy in the entire 2:45 of torture, except for when the moment audience realizes it is over and they can go home. I'm not sure what people who liked this movie saw in it. If you're looking for a good time, this isn't it. The most redeeming thing about Bladerunner 2049 is that it makes you appreciate every other movie with a shred of entertainment value even more.",

While some may complain that the move is long and slow at times, on the contrary, I felt like it was constantly tugging at my soul to further emerse myself in a very thought provoking and intelligent sci-fi movie. Don't drink a lot of fluids before or during the movie because you will not want to get up and miss any of it. To me it evoked very tense feelings through out the move and every time I thought I could predict how the plot was going to play out, a twist was right around the corner. For those looking for a high explosion ratio movie will be disappointed with Blade runner 2049. But if you are looking for the perfect extension of the 1982 Blade runner that touches on many relevant and thought provoking topics that need additional analysis and discussion then this is it. This movie is intelligent sci-fi at its best. Just like the original it will stand the test of time. Oh and Ryan Gosling was the perfect pick for Officer K. Obviously for us Blade runner fans I cannot heap any more praise on Harrison Ford he owns Decker!",

He just tried to be a little too creepy in his role. Whereas Ryan Gosling, Robin Wright and others all played their roles with subtlety and a just a touch of mystery which was pitch perfect for the moody atmosphere of this film, only Leto breaks out into typically villainous monologues that defined his character as clearly \"weird\" but not that interesting. \nAgain, I think a lot of why I enjoyed this film was because I enjoyed the art of the cyberpunk cities of the Blade Runner universe and enjoyed the glimpses of some hi-tech/ low-life William Gibson-esque type of people that inhabit these cities. The visuals were entertaining enough that there was always something in the world to appreciate even though it takes some time for plot points to develop.",

Despite being a direct sequel to the cult classic original; (which I personally didn't like other than a few of its moments) this film stands on it's own legs delivering a stand alone story that delves deep into the world's mythology and asks questions about what it means to be human. \n\nI can understand why its unique style (which takes queues from the first Bladerunner) might not be to everybody's taste and thus is reducing the box office success. The pacing is unrelentingly slow, there is no perceptible build up to a climactic third act and the action isn't romanticised and focused on like other Hollywood blockbusters. That's where this thing of beauty is born though. Despite the pacing, not once did I lose attention.  Every frame, every shot and every moment was crafted like a statue out of marble. Every single scene was meticulously planned and every sound and musical note timed to perfection. All a result of Denis Villeneuve continued brilliance in directing. \n\nStrong performances from its plethora of great actors kept you in the moment. Ryan Gosling carried the film well with his portrayal of the soulless synthetic and Harrison Ford showed his best acting abilities that I have seen in a long time. Robin Right, Jared Leto and even Dave Bautista's small role were pulled off excellently too. \n\nThere's not much that you can say about this film that won't in some way give spoilers but I implore anybody with the opportunity, to see this film IMAX while they can. It's a rare film that might only come once in a generation and is a must see in the best format available. \n\n10/10 Masterpiece",

When people try too hard to grasp the truth, they find themselves bound by narratives created by others.",

Only when Harrison Ford appears does the pace pick up for a while as he makes a concerted attempt to kill Gosling's character. Would that he had succeeded and saved us from the final half hour. I am afraid those critics who claim to like this movie did not understand what was good about the original. There is more to 'great cinematography' than giving us three different colours of smog.",

It's cool to make movies about androids, but we shouldn't assume they are the largest audience. The real problem with this 2'45'' long movie is that the plot doesn't move quickly or cohere. Villeneuve asks for a lot of time and doesn't move the story forward. We end very close to where we began, in a film without climax, sense or motivation. While the cast has big names, the acting is unimpressive. Given the skills of some of the actors, including Robin Wright, we can probably assume that the director and script are at fault. Wright can act anything, but they didn't make the most of her here, and frankly, her character and its death were both gratuitous. There were too many plot lines in this movie, and none of them were resolved by the end. We just jumped from one slow, suggestive sequence to the other. Other members of the cast didn't even have Wright's potential. Ana de Armas, for example, seems to have made a career out of being cute. But trading off one's looks doesn't create great artistic effects, and Blade Runner is the poorer for her part in it. Gosling's range is limited and his smirk is ever present. Ford was more present on the screen, but had a smaller part and again, a non-sensical role.",

            "content": "A perfect eye and a pale near-void of complex, indecipherable patterns gives way to a sterile protein farm full of empty space; filled with a feeling of deprivation and loneliness. This is how Blade Runner 2049 begins before bringing us back to the wet, ultra-dense, black and neon maze of the super-city we know so well. This is how Denis Villeneuve lets us know right away that this is his movie, one full of reverence for the original, but a film that is much, much more than a mere homage.\n\nVilleneuve has always been much more Kubrickian than Ridley Scott ever was. In his best work, Scott was a great visionary and incredible composer, but he doesn't have quite the same feeling with the composition. Villeneuve continues to bring us transcendentally arresting visual arrangements, rather than copying Scott's style. This is an excellent choice because when you're picking up the thread of a work of art 35 years later, it's best to make your production your own.\n\nOnce or twice I felt the dialogue might be a little on-the-nose to the themes, but I don't feel conclusive about this at all and I won't deduct from my grade. One thing is for sure, Villeneuve is not copying the original Blade Runner to any degree. There are a small handful of nods to the original, but this is such its own. The structure and pacing of this story is not at all a carbon copy of the first, and it does an excellent job of bringing you in sync with its rhythm.\n\nThis is a challenging film, as it should be! There are many subtleties to the motivations of the characters. In particularly, there is a fight that moves from gunplay to fisticuffs that Gosling's character of \"K\" takes part in which I'm not entirely sure I understand the cause for, but I also don't see any clear break in logic to it, either. There are a great deal of elements to this work which are fine-tuned to evoke thought and contemplation. This is, again, in line with Kubrick's priorities and works.\n\nIn some ways, this movie reminds me of Logan (2017). Naturally, Blade Runner 2049 was in production before that film was even released, so I would say it's more a matter of both of them tapping into some very classic themes; themes which seem to be very resonant at this moment.\n\nNothing bad can be said about any of the dramatic talent. Everyone is the definition of pitch-perfect. The set work and special effects are all breathtaking. The music was for me almost 100% perfect and amazing, but the very loud and harsh \"waahhh-ohhh\" synth noises in \"Sea Wall\" (the music during the lead-up to the final confrontation) and reprised in the end credits music \"Blade Runner\" were not to my taste. They are anxiety-inducing with their timbre and tonality (probably intended) and also bring bad dubstep to mind, so this was an unfortunate negative piece for me. If they were a little different, it probably would have been much more welcome to me. As much as I dislike it, though, I can't imagine lowering the grade on an otherwise perfect film for a musical element that's only in the movie for not even a minute total split between two instances.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 possesses depth and integrality of meaning and emotion the equal of its predecessor, the original Blade Runner. It is a captivating and powerfully moving work of highest art, of the kind that is so very badly needed today. It is my most fervent wish that any further entry in this story maintains this level of excellence. To mar the existing works with a sequel that is anything less would be a crime.",

But I appreciate it for what it is and enjoy the universe it is set in and it's immersive atmosphere. \n\nI was unsure what to expect with this movie. I was concerned that they were going to retread areas of the first movie and spoil it. As with all sequels you worry in what direction the movie is going to take given the source material. Thankfully 2049 only continues the Blade Runner universe and manages to recreate the same universe and atmosphere through it's amazing settings, locations, visuals, characters etc etc etc. It's just as immersive as the first film.\n\nwithout spoilers, the story i felt was compelling and had me engaged almost throughout trying to put together the pieces of the puzzle. The only thing I guess one could fault is that unlike the first movie, The story is clear and fully explained not leaving much to interpretation or imagination which is entirely subjective really.\n\nAs time goes on, from when i saw the movie the more I enjoyed it and fully appreciate its dedication and appreciation of the source material. I'd thank the makers of this movie wholeheartedly that they didn't take any liberties over the source material like in recent sequels a.k.a Terminator genisys, Alien covenant, prometheus etc etc etc. And made an extremely good and faithful sequel. \n\nI would consider this movie a masterpiece of recent times. However by no means perfect. My first issue is the soundtrack, Although I do like! It seems like in places it doesn't know what to do with itself. At parts it pays great homage to Vangelis and on the other had it can sound quite generic in places with the hard bass squeeling and rumbling. I did enjoy the soundtrack greatly.... It does become a bit distinguishable  half way through\n\nMy second issue was slight pacing issues, Now the same could be said of the first however there were only very specific scenes where i felt the pacing drop and I felt frustrated and just wanted to move on. Trying not to spoil anything. It was pretty much all of the scenes with Jared Leto. Not his fault... it's just how the scenes were, they seemed drawn out and quite boring really... there wasn't great scenery or visuals to enjoy just long dialogue with long pauses and they came off a bit strange to me which was the intention...but with the length of these scenes, I just wanted it to move on and get back to the main characters who are in more interesting scenarios and scenery.\n\nAnd i would also say this needs to be experienced in a cinema, I cannot imagine the music and the sound effects having the same meaning or feeling at home on your T.V\n\nI have to give it a 5 though. No movie in recent time has made me want to watch it more than once at the cinema (which is what I'm going to do)",

This film is in one word, a masterpiece in filmmaking, sound, and a visual of a future where destructive images cloud the reality of hope.\n\nRarely can a movie, that originally starred someone of the massive screen presence of Harrison Ford, been able to launch us to this \"Brave New World\". The haunting images of the ultimate price of destroying the earth and it's beauty to a somber, dark, lifeless cloud of despair. The robotics were not just the replicants, they were in those that survived, lost hope, sadness of a spirit that have lost its way.\n\nIt was an easy fit for me since I was blown away by the first movie in 1982 and it's image of a future of advertising, robotics, flying vehicles and computer animation far ahead of its time. They pushed the envelope and brought us into the world of blade runners in pursuit of replicants and the programs who set their objectives and kept you on the edge of your seat. Rick Deckard can only be played by an angry Harrison Ford 30 years later who has that old guy hard guy toughness. We all knew someone like this when we were growing up. Ryan Gosling, in a surprise for me, nails it with his emotionless Agent K who has uncovered secrets that could change the very existence of earth. They work well together. It is difficult to top the Ridley Scott original, this movie built on that foundation and Dennis Villeneuve took it to the next level of the apocalyptic vision of destruction.\n\nFalling like snowflakes the toxic dust makes shadows of the surrounding daylight. The ash so densely fills the air snowplows keep the ravages of the horror in 2049 Los Angeles. \n\nFood needs to be processed in lab like conditions for any chance at survival. The sadness the director captures is well seen in the eyes of Lt. Joshi, played by Robin Wright. She is key in this movie as she transforms from an uncaring, play by the rules Lt. to doing what is right to change the direction of the planet. \n\nImagine, like the one and only John Lennon, came to mind the next day after absorbing the opus I just witnessed. This movie is not for the short attention span crowd, you need to pay attention to the nuances and characters. I'd recommend watching the 1st film to give some backstory to what happened between the blade runners and replicants. Not mandatory just a fun watch. It takes us out of our comfort zone to that world of unbounded imagination. There is light at the end of the tunnel I hope you can see it in this movie. Enjoy! Well done.",

Dick novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" and titled it \"Blade Runner.\" It escaped audiences, polarized critics, warranted multiple re-edits, and then eventually became a giant in the sci-fi world. It's flawed and confused (hence the multiple versions), yet undeniably engaging in its dark futuristic vision and mysterious story. However, with \"2049,\" director Denis Villeneuve has turned in something timeless, brilliant and more assured. Perfectly matching the tone and aesthetics of the original, it still flies above it, and ultimately feels wholly its own.\nOne difference is its tendencies. Where the original heavily leans into its film noir aspects, \"2049\" is more insistent on its heady sci-fi elements. We've got giant incestuous corporate corruption (creating products that buy other products), Siri/Alexa-like beings taken to the Nth degree, villainous powers-that-be lying to everyone about who and what they are. It's a dense and precise script, with dialogue good enough to chew on. Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast, Robin Wright is a national treasure, Jared Leto is a creepy beast, and the appearance of Harrison Ford as classic anti-hero Rick Deckard is a re-emergence for the ages.\nAt this point, I'm convinced Villeneuve couldn't make a bad movie if he tried. The way he uses the actual art of filmmaking to get across his points almost seems second-nature. In one edit, the embers from a fire slowly fade into the lights of the city, indicating the futility of trying to contain something wild. It's a viscerally, aesthetically, emotionally and violently overwhelming film that not only builds on the original but surpasses it.",

I would have slept through more of it if it hadn't been for the incessant loudness, keeping me awake through nearly 3 hours of desperately wanting something to happen.  The Atari brand advertising was more embarrassing than nostalgic, as if anyone would believe they could be a big player in 2049.  I consider myself to be a bit of a 3D aficionado and this was a really lazy conversion with no standout 3D moments to recall. Even the films cinematographer has come forward to say 'don't bother' with the 3D version. I saw this on the second night after opening in an almost-empty cinema, and the few people around me looked equally unimpressed. I guess this is one of those films that will forever bewilder me that it can score such consistently 5 star reviews from the critics, although it looks like even that won't stop it from becoming a commercial flop.",

            "content": "It's not easy to capture lightning in a bottle. Perfectly recapturing the look, sound, feel, and unique blend of elements that defined the original Blade Runner is no small task. Capturing its substance is harder still. And yet this film does it perfectly. Director Denis Villeneuve and the others involved have succeeded in creating the rare sequel that perfectly recreates the style of its predecessor while expanding on its story and themes.\n\nRyan Gosling stars as Officer K, a new model replicant who works for the LAPD \"retiring\" unstable older models. He lives alone, except for his house's holographic interface, who gives new meaning to the phrase \"virtual girlfriend.\" Like all of the new models he's very good at his job and never questions orders. At least until a \"routine retirement\" turns up a secret that challenges everything he thought he knew about his nature, and could change the global balance of power- or plunge what's left of civilization into war.\n\nThe original Blade Runner asked intriguing questions about what it means to be human. 2049 goes a step further, questioning the nature of what's real. Characters struggle with whether their memories are their own, someone else's, or something entirely manufactured. The mutual affection between K and his holographic girlfriend raises the question of whether an AI can truly feel, or if there's any way for her to become a real girl. And the enduring question from the ending original Blade Runner is still very much open.\n\nVisually this film is a masterpiece of bleakness. LA is still the shadowy, run down megatropolis it was before, just a little flashier and newer. Endless sheets of rain still pour down on darkened streets as streetlights and flashing signs struggle to illuminate the perpetual gloom and holographic ads offer pleasures of every kind to passersby.\n\n Only this time the streets don't seem so crowded as before. Which makes sense given that anyone who can afford to has bought passage off planet. Because if LA is dystopian the world beyond its walls is downright post-apocalyptic. San Diego is a wasteland of rust, Vegas haze shrouded tomb, frozen in time. And in between is only desolate emptiness as far as the eye can see. And it's all so artfully photographed and exquisitely atmospheric.\n\nHarrison Ford doesn't have as much screen time as the trailers might have suggested, but whenever he's on screen it's clear that he hasn't lost a beat. The weariness and slight grumpiness that seems to be his default setting these days serves him well as the reclusive old Deckard, gone semi-paranoid after so many years in hiding. He throws a mean punch for a man his age, and radiates a mix of anger, sadness, and tired resignation as he describes all that's transpired in the last thirty years. Gosling likewise excels in the frequent action scenes and gives a wonderfully nuanced performance as a man questioning who and what he really is\n.\nBut it's Jared Leto who makes the strongest impression. As ruthless industrialist Niander Wallace- creator of the new generation of replicants- he is a study in contradictions. His manner is eerily emotionless, yet his gaze exudes brilliance and obsession. He calls the replicants his children and speaks of their destiny and need to grow, but treats them as disposable. And his zeal to propel mankind forward makes him merciless to anyone who stands in his way. We're not entirely sure what he is either. He seems to be a cyborg, but it's unclear how far the changes go, or if he might be something more artificial altogether. What I do know is that this performance is enough to redeem him for his overwrought turn as the Joker in Suicide Squad.\n\nIf this movie has a fault it's that it stays too faithful to the original's grating synthesizer soundtrack, heavy on reverb and distortion. But then again, I suppose that it does fit the film's mood and add to the sense of tension when needed. And while the fights and shootouts are very good, nothing can match Deckard's battle with Roy in the last film. Blade Runner 2049 is not quite the original, but it comes very close. And for a movie like Blade Runner that's high praise indeed.",

            "content": "The plan for Blade Runner 2049, the thirty-five year later sequel to director Ridley Scott's 1982 now classic Blade Runner, was to watch Scott's \"final cut\" of the film prior to seeing director Denis Villeneuve's (Prisoners, Sicario, Arrival) follow-up. The original Blade Runner is one of those movies that I was always told I needed to watch and indeed started countless times, but never actually made it all the way through. Whether it was due to a lack of intrigue, bad timing, or something of the like I somehow ended up feeling rather familiar with the world Scott created from this Philip K. Dick short story without ever really becoming aware of the narrative it was relaying. Alas, there wasn't time to squeeze in a viewing of the original film prior to my wife and I's planned date night this past Saturday (things happen when you have an almost three year-old and Friday night, Blade Runner didn't happen) and so, with little knowledge of exactly what to expect from Blade Runner 2049 other than a visually stunning experience (cinematographer Roger Deakins is once again responsible for what we see here) this second, seemingly more intrusive story into the world of replicants and their version of the future happened. So, did I understand everything that happened? I think so. Did I appreciate everything as much as the guy behind me who said \"wow\" out loud no less than seventeen times throughout the two hour and forty-five minute runtime? Probably not. Still, Blade Runner 2049 is a movie that is able to stand on its own to a degree, but certainly benefits from having the knowledge of what occurred in the prior installment. Having gone back since seeing 2049 and watched the final cut of the original film I feel as if I've had a unique enough experience with the larger story being told that my individual experience with the film is something of a reverse of the rose-tinted glasses idiom in that the original film is not one that has been unduly idolized because of its stance in pop culture before I had the opportunity to make up my own mind about it, but rather my perspective on the original is of more significance because I know where these characters go and I know what the actions took in that initial film lead to. This inverse experience while, not necessarily recommended, tends to only make 2049 that much more mystical-that much more epic and that much more meaningful.\n\nread the whole review at www.reviewsfromabed.com",

It's an interesting and imaginative look at the future.  The use of reflected water was overdone at times, why does an underground group in the sewers have beautiful and intentional water reflections everywhere, for instance.  Too slow for kids or for ppl who have to check their phones every few minutes.  Great for me.",

The visuals too are new, but with a huge dose of what made the original such a treat for the eyes. Gone is the excessive film grain and it has been replaced with environmental factors like rain, snow and dust. The sense of scale is as impressive as the whole film is beautiful, the viewer wanting to absorb every minute detail. It's rare for me to recommend 3D over 2D, but here it is staggering, especially when you consider that it was filmed in 2D and converted post production. True, the film relies very heavily on CGI making a post production 3D conversion easier, but it is done seamlessly and it's impossible to see where the live action ends and the CGI begins, except where it is necessary to the context of the film.\nThe plot, the script, the acting and overall pace are superb, to the extent that I literally spent much of the 163 minute running time on the edge of my seat. A long film, but one which doesn't feel long at all.\nHaving seen Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049 almost back to back I am very glad to say that this unnecessary sequel is every bit as good as the original, but in somewhat different ways and if you get a chance to see it in IMAX 3D then you should.",

            "content": "Given the current Hollywood climate of endless reboots, sequels, and soft remakes, Blade Runner 2049 is refreshing in that it neither attempts to merely repeat the story of the first film with flashier effects, nor does it compromise its vision with obligatory action set pieces, dumbed down dialogue, and brisk pacing. Of course there is still action and flash in this film, but it takes as much time as it wants to build up to it. What we end up with is a film that offers a new experience while still largely remaining true to the feel of its predecessor, which is possibly one of the biggest compliments you could say about a sequel. However, 2049 was a bit of a give and take situation for me. On the one hand, I feel that the story was a marginal improvement over the first film with a greater sense of mystery, more dramatic moments, and characters having more personal stakes in the narrative. On the other, the soundtrack was a bit of a downgrade from Vangelis' serene atmospheric compositions. Harmonic synth is instead replaced with oppressive percussion, which I get is part of Hans Zimmer's signature style, but god dammit, if there was ever a time for him to break out of his shell and just do a classic franchise justice, this would be it. Daft Punk would have been much better suited for this job, having already done the soundtrack for Tron Legacy and sharing a similar style to Vangelis. Visually, 2049 also doesn't quite achieve the same level of immersion as the first film due to there being a few too many scenes shot in broad daylight and outside the bounds of the beautiful muddied metropolis of LA. When it does actually spend its time there though, it is some top notch cinematography to behold. Nonetheless, all of this adds up to a downgrade in atmosphere from the first film, which for me is one of the biggest draws to this universe. In spite of the story overall being an improvement, it still carries shortcomings. The most dramatically impressive moment happens fairly early on in the film, when Ryan Gosling's character, Agent K, investigates an old factory that may have a connection to his memories. I got literal chills feeling the suspense of this scene, but unfortunately it never quite reaches the same dramatic heights after that, and the final climax essentially amounts to a fairly brief fight scene, but this time without a thought-provoking replicant speech at the end. Don't be too discouraged by these criticisms though. Blade Runner 2049 is still a worthy successor to the original film, and one that will likely be discussed and appreciated for just as many decades after its release.",

With every sweeping shot of the city made up and fake with CGI, I still felt the gritty city's realistic pull dragging me in to walk the streets of California with K and help with his main goal.\n\nNot only does the city feel realistic and not too far out of reach to today; the characters also feel real, and fit perfectly into the world. Ryan Gosling's K may be a synthetic human; along with most of the cast, but each character was thought out by the writers to be better than their human counter parts. Which is mind-blowing to see robots have better choices than humans.\n\nThe visuals in Blade Runner were just extremely pretty to look at. The blue and orange tint that presents itself to the audience is felt throughout the movie gives off a very electrical vibe that the audience can truly feel. Whether it's seeing K walk down the neon lit streets of California or just him in his apartment with his holographic girlfriend you can tell each visual was thoughtout and worked on with precise craftsmanship.\n\nBlade Runner 2049's key elements are visuals, special effects, CGI, characters, and story telling. With that said this movie is long, 2 hours and 44 minutes is extremely long to some people. My personal opinion is go see this movie whenever you have a chance, but my 3 recommendation's are try to see it IMAX. if you can't no biggie, but the harder recommendedations that you should seriously consider is seeing the first one; without seeing it son parts could get confusing. Lastly, settle in for the long haul. Blade Runner 2049 is a long thought out movie which could turn some people away, but nonetheless it is still an extremely great and fun film.",

It started with a good action scene, and then after that became a slow-drag of a movie that felt 4 hours long instead of 2 and a half. The sound and music (if you want to call it that) was aweful, each scene dragged on too long, and the more interesting potential story lines weren't given any effort to develop.  And the weather!!! Raining and snowing in LA - it all just made no sense. I was looking forward to a good Sci-fi, but this one is still a snooze-fest.",

Quite simply, this movie was one of the top 5 movies this year...and certainly one of the best Sci-Fi Noir movies of all time. I think it very important that people don't go into Blade Runner 2049 with preconceived notions of all out Sci Fi action intense screenwatching. It actually is quite the opposite. The movie's main draws are extremely beautiful future sprawling landscapes and set design. It as a 2001 type minimalist feel throughout. However, when the action is in play it is amazingly done. The last fight sequence at the end of the movie was some of the most intense action I have ever seen.\n\nI highly recommend this movie, but I must state...make sure you are rested and prepared for a 2hr 44min journey. I feel if you are a huge fan of the first Blade Runner, this will tickly your fancy for days. Brilliant movie making at its finest! However, if you have ADD and have problems sitting and paying attention in a movie theater, this movie will probably run you out of the theater.\n\nIn essence, if you were to extend the movie Dark City (one of the all time great Sci Fi movies), it and Blade Runner are almost identical in terms of feel. I'm really confounded by humans I must say. Things I think should be great and garner tons of attention and likes wind up being not appreciated. Then there is less than stellar drivel like Transformers 5 (utter and complete garbage...literally) that rakes in the big bucks. Maybe it's time for America to grow and wake the hell up and appreciate true art at it's finest like Blade Runner 2049. Great frikking movie, solid soundtrack (although not as great as the first BR), solid acting and great set pieces make this one of 2017s greatest movies of this generation!",

            "content": "Blade Runner 2049 - Alan Humphrey, Rotten Tomatoes\n\n\nThe dark and desolate Los Angeles depicted by Ridley Scott and Denis Villeneuve is a convincing one. Ecosystems have failed and humanity seems adrift. Farms are experimental and the public seems lost in a sea of vice and hopelessness. \n\nOfficer K is searching for something, and he has the capability and power to do it his way. The LAPD Detective, who routinely checks into his office only to be barraged with an intense exam of Orwellian complexity, is slowly uncovering clues to the whereabouts of a very important girl. We don't know who or what exactly, and yet can't help but feel completely reeled in as he goes about his work. \n\nIn the meantime we are introduced to the futility of year 2049 farming, with Dave Bautista making a cameo as Sapper Morton, the old, defeated farmer representing a populace that's given up on itself. \n\nAna de Armas as \"Joi\" the downloadable, storable but somehow mostly human hologram, shows us the future of romantic entertainment as a digi-girlfriend for Officer K, as her cleverly displayed elements add comic relief and emotional engagement in a way I haven't witnessed in a film before.  Sure, her essence is borrowed from Star Trek and sure, de Armas can hold the male audience's attention with ease, but she isn't shoehorned into the film to do just that. There are two critical scenes involving \"Joi\" that, with her limitations in mind, give the audience a unique treat I won't dare ruin. And in a later scene that I also will not ruin, Joi utters the phrase \"I love you\" with a timing and meaning that felt uniquely delivered.\n\nJared Leto as \"Niander Wallace\" plays a  powerful businessman and slave-owner who replicates Nexus 8 human clones and seeks to increase his power in the crumbling world. He has slaves, and he wants more. We don't really have enough time in this film, even given its nearly 3-hour run time, to understand more, but we don't need to at this time. He's only in the movie sporadically, but as usual, Leto's acting is superb. \n\nHarrison Ford as \"Deckerd\" was a welcome addition to Ford's resume. The true fans of this franchise will be excited to see him, while I found other elements in the film more enjoyable.\n\nThe cinematography in BR 2049 is simply jaw-dropping, from the long exploration takes to the aerial shots to the immense live sets to the coloring of the radioactive sand of a post-apocalypse Nevada desert. Roger Deakins should win an Oscar for his work, and I think this time at last, he will. The lighting, colors, framing and camera work are all just awesome and there really isn't a project in cinematic history that can match it. One particular confrontation scene involves a projector in Las Vegas partially reactivating stored performances of Elvis, Marlyn Monroe and countless colorful dancers, the main characters fighting and marching through the light while the show dazzles around them in interrupted bursts. An orgasmic visual treat of this level should be considered Oscar-grade stuff. And it is. \n\nThe sound engineering in this movie is sublime, with an array of 80s-style synths amped to max with ear-piercing resonance, creating a tone of mystique confusion and despair that fully transport the viewer into the BR2049 universe. The soundtrack alone is enough of a reason to enjoy the movie.  \n\nThe dialogue is sharp and concise, the writing clean, and the 7 or 8 characters featured interact with each other well. Ryan Gosling showcases some of the best work of his career as a menacingly tough LAPD cop, who completely in-character and committed, his full conviction as an actor on display as he tears through opposition and barriers. \n\nGun shots are fired, but only at the select moments and with precision and meaning. They are loud, resonating and deep with significance. \n\nThe only complaints I have are minimal and barely worth mentioning:  a dog can be clearly seen staring at his trainer in a late scene. \n\nAnd the run time of this film is a bit excessive -- there are many scenes that could simply have been edited down. I would have preferred a full 3 hours with more dialogue or more scenes of Leto's \"Niander Wallace\" explaining more about his grande vision.  \n\nI have seen this film and will see it again this weekend on IMAX - which I recommend you all do as well. It is an epic masterpiece.",

I watched it in 3D and I felt like it was not just a movie, but also a great audio-visual experience that yearned to be seen on the big screen. It was beautiful to look at, like the originalwas, but it also expanded on things established in the original movie, showing more of the world than just one large city. These days, the original Blade Runner is commonly considered as a Science Fiction classic and has been very influential for many film makers, even though it under-performed at the box office. In my opinion, the sequel more than lives up to the reputation of the original. \n\nThere were enough action scenes, but there was also an interesting plot and character development for the main character, played by Ryan Gosling. Harrison Ford also reprised his role as Deckard later in the movie. Not only was his character more than a mere cameo, but he gave a genuinely good performance as a much older Deckard, giving his character more depth, something which many critics have felt, lacked in the original. This time, there's some actual detective work and a genuine mystery, which I will not spoil here. There are the usual tropes: filn noir style, a femme fatale character, a detective who has a miserable life, seedy back alleys, a large conspiracy and also, the typical cyber punk stylings.\n\n See it for the action, great performances, big science fiction ideas and great visuals and heavy themes, like what it means to be a human. I'm sure, when time passes, i will be nit-picking on possible flaws, like perhaps a few plot holes, some pacing issues here and there, or something like that, but at the moment, I can only give it a full score. Even with the long running time, it felt like it was just the perfect length, for the story it wanted to tell. In my opinion, the movie will be talked about, for years to come.",

            "content": "It's been years since I've experienced a movie in theatres where almost every image left me in awe. Not impressed, not merely captivated, but in awe. In most \"good looking\" films, it's easy to find several scenes in images where your eyes feel like shrugging compared to the rest of the film's imagery. It was difficult to find very many scenes like that in Blade Runner 2049. Even when there's next to no visual action going on in the frame, these images still find a way to impress. But thankfully, there's more to Blade Runner 2049 than just pretty pictures. Director Denis Villeneuve never forgets that this is a Blade Runner movie, a dark mystery about what it really means to be human in a world filled to the brim with advanced technology. The lovely visuals aid the story, instead of trying to bury it.\n\nIf you're looking for a critic to explain the plot of Blade Runner 2049 to you, I'm afraid you're in the wrong place. Not just because of the director's wishes against spoilers, but also because experiencing a story taking place is much better than having it summed up in a few paragraphs. But for those seeking the basics of the plot, here they are: it takes place in the future, it involves a cop, and he's investigating something.\n\nIf I still have your attention, then let's carry on with the review. Like the first movie, Blade Runner 2049 is also a movie that needs to be experienced. The darker and harsher world of this film can't be effectively conveyed without the movie's performances, sound design, and visual effects. For starters, going back on our earlier point, the movie is a special visual experience. So much so that thanking one crew member for the look of the film would be extremely unfair. So equal praise should go to everybody involved with the technical side of this project, not just to a clever director and cinematographer.\n\nThe dingy streets and neon lights effectively convey a similar atmosphere that was established in the first film. But the common holograms, unusual architecture, and vast landscapes show that this is a world that has evolved and changed since 2019, and not necessarily for the better. Holograms are either used as in-your-face advertising (sometimes literally) or simple tools designed to tell you what you want to hear and fulfill your unfulfilled desires. Vast landscapes throughout the film are often too vast and too empty, often dwarfing the main character in their sheer size and emptiness. And the unusual architecture, even when it seems to be made out of wood, feels designed rather than constructed. In fact, very few things in this world seem real, even an attempt at dinner from Detective K (Ryan Gosling) looks like it was made from plastic. And the only real constructions left in this world are either abandoned or salvaged. This is a world that is equal measures fascinating and horrifying, like gazing into a potential future for mankind.\n\nThe sound design also really helps in bringing this troubled world to life. The musical score, while lacking the magic of Vangelis's score for the original film, still works in harmony with the moods and emotions for each scene. From throat-singing in Wallace's (Jared Leto) chamber, to the menacing drums used for a futuristic L.A.P.D. tower, to the playful chimes used in Detective K's romantic encounters with the optimistic Joi (Ana De Armas); these little touches in the soundtrack truly emphasize the emotion of each scene. Again, supporting the film, not trying to make up for it. It's a miracle that this soundtrack turned out as good as it did, considering the last minute change of composers and the fact that the soundtrack is almost entirely original. And of course, a dystopia could never come to life without convincing sound effects, and Blade Runner 2049 is no exception. This is an overused statement, but every sound used outside of the soundtrack truly feels real. No blaster sounds, no explosions that sound way quieter than they should, and no other silly overused sci-fi sound effects. Every bang, crash, jump, shot, step, and yell sounds exactly like it should. For example, in Dave Bautista's scene, we originally find him farming in a heavy radioactive suit. And with that moment, we can hear the heavy steps, echoes, and breathing that would go on in such a suit. The audience is there in his suit, and we didn't need any cheap POV or overlong establishing shots to get that level of immersion. It's such a short, inconsequential scene, but it's impressive that even the smallest scenes in Blade Runner 2049 are trying to pull you into its world instead of pushing you away.\n\nAnd then, we arrive at the final stage of crafting a fictional world: the characters. Admittedly, there are few characters that feel like they never get any time to properly develop. Although, looking back at the film, maybe that's because I enjoyed their company so much. Ryan Gosling, an actor who should win the most improved actor award at this point, is perfect as a morally conflicted detective. I truly believed every step of his struggle, every emotion he conveyed, and every blow to his face. And this is all done without a shred of overacting or \"phoning it in\", so to speak. Harrison Ford, reprising his role as Deckard, feels like he's actually acting this time. I was afraid that he was gonna \"Bruce Willis\" this important role, but he actually delivered. Is it because Harrison actually cares about this character? Or because the director cared enough to get him to actually act? Who knows? What matters is that he conveys a character that is both emotionally devastated and slightly desensitized to his previous events. All of the actors also suit their characters quite well, especially Jared Leto as Wallace and Ana De Armas as Joi. The actors certainly make the film's world all the more interesting and emotional, even when the story and writing fail to do so.\n\nSadly, the actual story behind Blade Runner 2049 can be pretty flawed at times. There are certain aggravating moments in the movie that call back to previous dialogue (even dialogue that literally just occurred) designed as \"A-Ha!\" moments for the audience. While this was an issue with the original Blade Runner, this is an issue that really should have remained buried in the past. It feels like pandering to the audience, and that the film doesn't respect the audience's intelligence as much as it should. This also carries on into the dialogue. Sometimes, the dialogue can rely a bit too much on clunky exposition, sometimes spelling out whole backstories to the audience like living audio logs. I get that the writers wanted to expand the world of Blade Runner more in this sequel, but it's a shame that they couldn't find more clever ways to do so in these moments. On even fewer occasions, the dialogue can sound outright unnatural, even if it's coming out of the mouth of an android.\n\nIt truly shows how special this film is, however, that these seemingly big flaws are somehow inconsequential and end up feeling like minor annoyances more than anything. This is still an intriguing mystery story with a lot of tricks up it's sleeve, even for longtime fans of Blade Runner and dystopian Science Fiction. It's also impressive that the film never loses touch of it's themes, like the first film this is still a story about how life and reality can even be considered special in a society filled with technology and prejudice. And it's a breath of fresh air that every aspect of the film effectively conveys that message, instead of just a clever script and a few great performances. Yes, the film isn't quite as smart or clever as it's predecessor, but any movie that gets even close to reaching the magic of Blade Runner is well worth your time. The visual experience alone is worth the price of admission, but thankfully there's so much more lurking beneath the smooth surface.\n\nSee it in IMAX if you can.",

There are some neat visual effects here but the movie completely lacks nuance.  The musical score, if it can be called that, is muddy and at times glaringly loud.  Most scenes are drawn out making the movie unnecessarily long.  The scenes with Mr Walllace are distracting, as are those where K is being \"baselined\".  Overall a klunky mess with attempts to replicate elements of the first movie - Dekard falls for a replicant whereas K falls for a hologram - Rutger dies feeling raindrops whereas K dies feeling snowflakes.

Well-acted on every front, superbly directed, completely immersive, dense and rich without being overwhelming, and SO thought-provoking. The questions it asks you, that you ask yourself, and the conversations that this movie will spark of the soul, memory, being human, morals and ethics and so on, are powerful and leave an impact.

            "content": "An utterly organic evolution of the notions expressed in 1982. The film breathes in & out waves of embryonic ocean water as our empathy is ever so much increased at every crest for a being who is becoming more \"real\" moment  by moment. Aside from Agent K's arch, the film intimates grandiose designs by would be despots for their want of being God, but fortunately, we don't become mired in those as tropes. Indeed, Leto's Wallace is a fine coloring for a film world rich in want and desire, if often misguided. Our antagonist is truth itself, hope and the potential for disappointment, and the ever human ability to survive expectations of a truth revealed falling like tears in rain. This movie is so focused on the REAL THINGS that are important that I expect some will not know how to tolerate the films lack of interest in certain plot developments, such as the one of, well, for fear of spoiling, let's just say, the one-eyed, singularly minded idealist. Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece, absolutely. It has also successfully fused the tech reality of the imagined 2019, with the notions one might imagine for iPhone 14. There is philosophy in this movie, but again, it isn't interested in teaching you anything, and so pretentiousness is not one of its sins. This movie has exceeded my expectations on all fronts. One particularly enjoyable turn in this movie is the antagonistic personification embodied in Sylvia Hoeks, a bad ass, super witty & intelligent replicant who suffers the annihilation of her potential soul with every dark act she commits for the love and affection of her father figure played by Leto. It's a choice we see so many people become destroyed by and here it isn't just cute allegory, but the root for our own affection for this vicious bad gal. The weakest link, unfortunately, is Robin Wright, who never seems to figure out what kind of character she is playing.She's a competent actor, no doubt, but her performance still seems a bit jagged around the edges, not really having made it past the dress rehearsal phase and that can't be entirely her fault. On the other hand, the same could be said of Emmitt Walsh's performance, her counter point from the original.",

I found I had to stifle my laughter more and more as it went on.\nFor example, the chief villain knifes to death a newborn (adult-sized) replicant female, for no reason whatsoever, except to let the audience know he's evil, evil, evil! Similarly, the villain's henchwoman kills a policewoman for no good reason, yet leaves the protagonist alive when she should kill him, simply because the movie's plot still needs him. Instead, she kills his beloved holographic girlfriend (because, you guessed it, she's evil, evil, evil).\nOne other aspect of the new film I should mention is how cruddy it looks: the same rusty industrial junkyard I've seen in at least two dozen sci-fi dystopias. The original film, with its breathtaking cityscapes, was not a dystopia; nothing so clich\u00e9d. Instead, it was an advanced, complex, troubled world. Much like the real 2019 is likely to be.",

            "content": "There are great films, then there are films that can change your life.\n\nI've seen 3 films that left a mark and changed the way I feel and think. These films also changed my perception on movies in general and they are very much reflected on my works.\n\nFight Club\n\nMemento\n\n(500) Days of Summer\n\nI never saw any of these films in the theater. I was too young when Fight Club and Memento were released while I didn't even remember (500) Days of Summer being released. So in a way I never truly had a complete experience with those films. Films are and will always be meant to be seen in the big screen (sorry, streaming). I always wanted to watch a movie that I will love in the cinema.\n\nAnd that's what exactly happened last Sunday when I watched Blade Runner 2049.\n\nI am in no way a critic. I am just a fan and a lover of films. So allow me to indulge myself by writing why Blade Runner 2049 became one of my favorite films of all time.\n\nLet me start by saying that I didn't like the original Blade Runner. I know it sounds blasphemous considering it's a cult classic and is highly regarded as one of the most influential sci-fi films of all time. But for me, it felt too dragging and predictable at times. So I went to see 2049 with tempered expectations. I mean, I could've just skipped it and waited for it on HBO but seeing director Denis Villeneuve's previous works (Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival) I had this gut feel that he would do something special. I'm glad I didn't skip because my gut feel was damn right.\n\nRarely do you see a blockbuster filled with depth and so many layers. After the credits rolled all I could say was \"What?\" because it's tough to digest everything at first. But after thinking about it, together with reading articles and watching videos about it, I started to understand the movie which eventually led to me loving it. I read comments about it saying that the film tried to say a lot of things which eventually resulted in it being messy. While I agree that the film tries to say a lot, I don't think that it's messy. For me, it actually depicted the mind of someone who's asking what it means to be human. Asking that question will lead to more questions than answers. That is what happens to Ryan Gosling's Officer K.\n\nOfficer K is somehow trying to find his place in the world. This resonates with me a lot because I'm at the point in my life where I feel lost and I can't seem to figure out where I should be. The film also asks what it means to be alive and what it is that makes us special. K lived his entire life knowing that he's just a replicant hunting other replicants. Nothing more, nothing less. So when he discovered something that showed him he might be more than just a Blade Runner, he believed it. He believed that he is special, that there is more to his life than just the routine. He believed that there is more to him that what people say. That was the first time he felt truly special. But it turns out (spoiler alert!) that he's just a decoy. He wasn't so special after all. In a way, I can connect with that as well. Sometimes I ask myself if there's more to life than the routine and the norm. Like K, I want to be special. I want to feel like I'm important and I mean something. I grew up in an environment where people downplay this longing and tell me I shouldn't go after what I want. It makes me think that I'm just a peg in a board game and someone else is playing it. I feel like a small piece in a grand scheme just like how the replicants are. It makes me feel irrelevant. Eventually, K accepted the fact that he's just a piece and played his part knowing that there's a bigger picture. I think he felt like that was his true purpose, being one of the catalysts of change. Unlike K though, I've yet to accept that I'm just a peg and I still haven't discovered my true individual purpose.\n\nblade-runner-2049\n\n \n\nThese are just some of the realizations I had that prove Blade Runner 2049 is a very deep, philosophical film. Based on the articles I've read, people always got something different from it and that's why I love it. The film is open to interpretation because of how layered it is. At the heart of Villeneuve's films, you'll always see humanity in them and 2049 is a prime example. I'd like to believe that this is Villeneuve at his best.\n\nMy only gripe with the film is that it's a tad too long. Maybe that's one of the main reasons why other people are hesitant to watch it and might've contributed to it's somewhat poor performance at the box office. Less people who watched means less people I can talk to and discuss about my feelings for it. But other than that, the film is really great. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is near-perfect. Give that man his Oscar already. Almost every shot looks stunning. It's gorgeous. If the philosophical story doesn't pique your interest, then watch it only for the visuals. It's worth your money, promise. I really hope that it goes down as a sci-fi classic much like its predecessor.\n\nI can't wait to buy my own original DVD and watch it over and over again to discover more layers. But while it's still in the cinemas, go watch it and experience one of the best movies ever made.\n\nI will probably watch it again in IMAX.",

It's a technical achievement and in a landscape where Disney has popularized contempt for anything that's not color grading in 50 shades of gray and cinematography blander then the FPS genres output, it's so refreshing to see a movie that looks like an actual fucking movie.\n\nAnd much like the first movie: it's really a chore to watch. Look, I respect Blade Runner Uno's effect on fiction, that goes without saying, but I will shit chainsaws before I give even the beginnings of a fuck about any of the characters besides Roy who's only salvaged by his end speech. Unfortunately, this carries over into 2049 where it's really, really hard to care about what's happening and who its happening to with one exception, also at the tail end of the movie. \n\nHowever, the tedium feels worse here because it's almost 3 fucking hours long! The Final Cut already feels stretched out and that was an hour shorter then this! Someone fan edit this shit down to 2 hours and you will do this movie a MASSIVE service. \n\nOne area that is improved is the romance, in the first movies its really awkward and flat out doesn't work for me. Here? It's got a nice bit of irony and complexity by the end along with actually being tolerable. As I was watching the movie I constantly kept noticing little to mid length scenes that could easily get cut out and nothing would be lost. Scenes that surely would have cut the movie down by 15-20 minutes. \n\nSo yeah, as I said, it's a Blade Runner movie. All the ingredients for a kick ass movie are there but as is the seeming standard, we gotta bury it under pointlessly stretched story lines about people it's nigh impossible to care about.",

The original had a rounded complete story, and I was very aware that the filmmakers of 2049 had to come up with SOMETHING just to use the Blade Runner title and pay service to the fans, this was distracting.  \n\nWith that being said, for a pointless film this is really very good and I'm glad to report doesn't sour the original in any way.  \n\nOf course it doesn't need to be mentioned, but visually it's amazing, the sound design is the best I've come across for years, and the atmosphere is as immersive as an atmosphere can possibly be.  The story isn't that original though, but again, that's to be expected when you're tasked with reviving an older property.  Regardless of that, I still found the narrative to be satisfying and well done.  \n\nIt drags a little in the middle but really nails the climax, and overall I'm just relieved that they didn't butcher the Blade Runner name.

            "content": "Blade Runner 2049 is a hot mess. I've seen it twice now and have tried to gather a concise view on the film that everyone hails to be a masterpiece and a future classic. In that respect, nah, it's not a future classic but if you were ever going to make a sequel to Blade Runner - Denis Villeneuve has done the best he could do. But what does that say about the film? First off, Blade Runner 2049 is simply gorgeous and has been crafted with such care and respect to the original film and its world building that it's astounding how one could actually pull it off. Roger Deakins' cinematography elevates the immaculate production design to a whole other level showcasing a grotty dystopian future that still retains Deakins' sterile style yet still looking lived in and palpable. The late added score by Hans Zimmer feels interpolated with notes and tones from the illustrious Vangelis score from the original while at the same time pushing the envelope and even drawing from other sci-fi influences like the use of choral voices like Ligeti in 2001: A Space Odyssey. I as well happen to really like the slow pacing of the film which gives the subject matter time to breathe and allows its cast to really flesh out their performances. Dave Bautista, Ana de Armas and Sylvia Hoeks are fantastic in their supporting roles while Harrison Ford himself returns and is at the top of his game. At first I felt he was a little out of character from how I always remembered Deckard, but later when Ford gives a raw and moving performance while being confronting and questioned about his past truly showcased a range that I thought Ford had lost decades ago. However, the best thing about the film for me is the character of \"K\" and the awards worthy performance by Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling's character arc is beautiful, heartbreaking and visceral. The Kafka-esque nature of his character and the trials (get it?) and tribulations his character goes through gives the film true heart - something that the original Blade Runner actually failed to really provide. \nBut now we get onto the messy negatives. Right off the bat, just because the script was around in the 80's and that this story was always intended to be the sequel does not add quality to the story. Which is my all round problem with the film - the plot. If someone told you before the film began what the plot of the film was you would laugh. Upon seeing it a second time the on-paper plot did not bother me as much because I was more compelled by Gosling's character K more than anything else. To me, Blade Runner 2049 also rides the line shakily between Sony blockbuster and Art House project. It's not quite one and it's not quite the other. If there was more focus and an edit to remove (in my opinion) a little fluff here and there, then conceptually and narratively the film would be more concise and less muddled. Especially in regards as to why the antagonists and protagonists are in conflict. Blade Runner 2049 indeed dances with the idea of the philosophical nature of its predecessor but does it by saying the themes rather than displaying them however the ending of the film is rather sweet and has a very understated parallel with the original film. All hyperbole aside though, I feel this sequel has somewhat tainted some parts of my viewing/reading of the original film. Don't get me wrong; I did not want a re-hash of the original movie nor did I want a carbon copy. What I had hoped for was a film that bares the same tone and themes that understands that Blade Runner was a detective Noir picture that in the background was Science Fiction film rather than the other way around. And I guess I kinda got that, with a few flaws. On my first viewing around the half way mark I clicked that this is a great big expensive fan film. However - giving it time and a second viewing, I am less harsh and I stand by my opening statement that if they were ever going to make a sequel i'm glad it was done by someone who really cares about the universe and that Denis has done the best he could. Just please for the love of christ don't make another. I couldn't bare the thought of a Blade Runner cinematic universe. Please. PLEASE!",

Thirty-five years later, this sequel has actually done a fairly decent job of recreating the atmosphere and environment of the original film. Funny to say that, considering the passage of time, but really this film sets no new levels in those areas. And, the story came nowhere near as close. Of course, based upon the ratings others are giving, perhaps I just don't appreciate modern cinema, or am just jaded. If you've seen the original, you decide.",

To be honest I fell in asleep when I first watched it. So I was really doubtful when I went into the cinema to watch the new one. But it caught my attention very early on and the story was just amazing. -  A BIT SPOILER AHEAD! Especially the twist in the end when you'll find it out that the leader actor is not as important as you think moreover not even a \"key character\" a NOBODY. It's just amazing how well the movie was made around a person who is not even important. SPOILER OVER. -\nI do not really understand those reviews which are about the problems of Blade Runner 2049. Sexist!? Yes, it is but it shows us a darker future and if you think about the sexuality of advertisements, movies an everything surrounding us nowadays what  more can you expect from a movie which is presenting a darker futuristic world of ours. Woman problem!? I don't really see that either. I see why it could be a problem why it is so obvious for others but again it's a futuristic world where most of the population is replicates lacking of emotions therefore the female characters will be just as strong and aggressive as mans. Not to mention that their creator is a maniac man too. And even the human females have to be much stronger to survive in this falling society and probably raised in that kind of way. \n\nSo, all in all I was really surprised at the end of the movie and I was amazed by it and kept me rethinking of each questions it asked it's audience. It kept me entertained, questioned my believes in life, human nature and its relationship with artificial intelligence. This movie deserves more than what you read in the media and Ryan Gosling's acting just perfect of course not to forget about everyone else's very good performance. To be honest I never was really a big fan of Harrison Ford even though I love the original star wars it just seems to me that he is just a one character actor.

It seems that all these later day sequels and prequels (such as Alien Covenant, Prometheus and Star Wars) have one thing in common; they over-explain the original source material to the point of being revisionist and thus destroy the mysteries that were the essence of the original's lasting appeal. Blade Runner 2049 fits the same pattern.  Visually sublime, it definitely is, to the point of near perfection. But then again, the director Denis Villeneuve had the best source material to get inspiration from (i.e. the original 1982 Blade Runner film). The cinematography by Roger Deakins is a serious study in how to stretch the limits of German expressionism, with its canted angles and chiaroscuro reflections of water; it would be just if the Oscar goes in his direction. But what makes the heart slide when watching Blade Runner 2049 is that, beneath the beautiful visage, it has no heart. It substitutes the original's quest to classify the soul with a preoccupation with how to classify a species (the newly emergent self-reproducing Replicants). The narrative is a Lego-clump of various sci-fi themes, from the underground army awaiting their messiah, with their prophetic female leader (like the Fremen from David Lynch's 'Dune') to having a precious female of the new species that needs to be protected (i.e. Alfonso Cuaron's 'Children of Men') to the outright theft of the A.I./ human-avatar love making scene taken complete from Spike Jonze's 'Her'. The film has set the bar high for what can be imagined for a future dystopian world. But, it's the aspirations of the story that let the film down. It attempts to ask the big questions, but these seem hastily tagged on to an uninspiring story on species classification that is chewed upon for a prolonged 164 mins. The film is obsessed with visual perfection to the point of cold savagery. This perfection hides a cold heart and is summed up by the disguising of actress Sean Young's real face with a lagging 'more perfect' CGI version. Ironically Sean Young is given a cameo credit for this 'appearance'.",

            "content": "I had doubts about whether the sequel would be able to faithfully follow the original's stunning soundscape and entrancing visuals, but it stayed faithfully close to both, almost to a fault. While the world expanded into territories unseen in the first Blade Runner, it felt consistent and continuous and not like a departure, but the city realm remained nearly identical to its past incarnation, bringing up questions about how this civilization seemed unchanged after thirty years. In the end, I would prefer its direct reduplication of the earlier sets over a less satisfying new interpretation. \nThe soundtrack borrows heavily from the original Vangelis score, but boosts its power in a way more congruent with composer Hans Zimmer's more canon, and maybe tired, booming compositions. The score pushes the mood of the film persistently into a deeper and darker place, and left me emotionally fatigued. The single standout weakness of the film was the lack of compelling antagonists. Blade Runner 2049's are far from the compelling portrayals of Roy and Pris who round out the counterpoints to the philosophical questions posed in the original. Instead, we get Jared Leto outfitted with white contacts and a bionic ear implant, I suppose to not so subtly emphasize that he is a strange and evil outsider, with attempts at poetic philosophical musings that come off more like entries from the diary of a moody teenager who has just read his first Camus novel. Leto's android assistant never quite comes together as a coherent character, and seems to waver inexplicably between cold immorality and bursts of empathy.\nThe most absorbing moments are spent with K, played by Ryan Gosling with a reticence we have come to expect from him. His silent, meaningful stares provide breathing space in a film that could be overwhelming with its expansive sound and images. \nBlade Runner 2049 may not take many risks, but provides a stunning homage to the original and will leave you quiet and reflective in its immersive exploration of what it means to be real.",

            "content": "BORED TO (GORGEOUS) TEARS IN RAIN - My Review of BLADE RUNNER 2049 (3 Stars? 4 Stars? 5 Stars? I'm soooo torn!)\n\nLet's get this out of the way.  I've never been a huge BLADE RUNNER fan.  I've seen every released cut of Ridley Scott's film, and with narration, without narration, with outtakes from THE SHINING as Harrison Ford and Sean Young fly to a more promising future, or a more convincing ending argument that Deckard is a replicant, I always found it to be a visually astounding bore.  It's a slow moving, some would say ponderous, film noir tricked up with game-changing special effects...yet I've always been drawn to it.  I love dystopian tales, and this one, about a detective hunting down rogue replicants who escaped slavery and came to an acid rain-soaked Los Angeles to live more freely, is as bleak as they come.  Rutger Hauer brought so much life to his performance that everyone else's felt so self-serious.  Sure, living in this world would not have felt like a day at Disneyland, but man what a scowl-a-thon!\n\nSet 30 years after the events of the first film, Denis Villeneuve (ARRIVAL, PRISONERS) and writers Hampton Fancher (who wrote the original) and Michael Green (LOGAN, AMERICAN GODS), we meet K, a new-world replicant LAPD detective who discovers something suspicious on one of his routine rounds to dispose of an older model.  There's an interesting dynamic that Gosling gets to play, and play well, as his character struggles to kill his own kind.  He spends a LOT of time staring at things, but his intensely coiled emotions get their release in a scene both staggering and surprising.  \n\nI won't spoil the story, but it introduces a slew of memorable characters.  Robin Wright plays the LAPD Chief of Police further cementing her career phase as the go-to-gal for icy, intense leaders.  Ana De Armas as Joi, K's girlfriend of sorts, brings a Gal Gadot style of performance and is a part of some of the film's most arresting visual tricks.  Mackenzie Davis seems to be an alternate universe version of Darryl Hannah's Pris from the original, but with a completely different agenda. Carla Juri plays a doctor whose role will remain a mystery in this review, but I want to note that she's heartbreaking.  Jared Leto as Wallace, the blind CEO of a corporation that has taken over for the original's evil Tyrell, delivers a quiet, subtle turn, which just might be the biggest surprise of all!  His partner-in-crime, Luv (Sylvia Hoeks), just about walks away with the film as one of the most intensely aggressive foes since the T-2000. Since he's on the poster, it shouldn't be a surprise that Ford makes an appearance.  With a brief amount of screen time, his story is integral to the goings-on and contains the biggest twist.  \n\nSo why am I not passionate about this film?  I don't know.  Maybe I am.  I mean, the cinematography by Roger Deakins is awe-inspiring.  Every single shot of this movie made me gasp.  EVERY SINGLE SHOT.  It's hard to believe Deakins has never won an Oscar despite 13 nominations, so can we please correct this horrible oversight next year?  So much stays true to the original aesthetic in the city scenes, but where Deakins triumphs is in the new world building with such disparate landscapes as a hazy farm, a sunburned Las Vegas, or inside the LAPD where K occasionally goes to recalibrate.  Those scenes in particular will stay with me; the repetitious questions and answers and the urgency of the sound design.  \n\nThe score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch combined with the incredible sound editing  feels like a relentless wall of sound.  Its sustained intensity and disorienting qualities are the one factor that made me think Villeneuve is making his version of a Christopher Nolan movie.  At nearly three hours, the sound creates the feeling that the film is just one long sustained scene.  After a while, however, it made me a little restless and bored.  I wanted some levity, some oasis of silence instead of the constant pummeling.  Yes, there's originality in all of the creepy sounds, but despite the endless pauses and staring, the movie needed to both be shortened and be allowed to breathe.  It's a Catch 22 I cannot wrap my head around.  It's an almost perfect film that's also perfectly punishing.   At times, I just wanted out.  It's how I felt when I would watch MR ROBOT, which I gave up on in Season 2.  It's bold and visionary and yet, such a chore, such a slog, and an experience that made me want to sign up for a Silkwood shower stat.  \n\nBLADE RUNNER 2049 isn't quite as vile, because of those visuals, and also because its story has a beating heart.  But it does go on and on.  In fact, tonally it feels a lot like the original.  There's a quiet, meditative film about what it's like to be human, buried under an aural cacophony.  Like all good science fiction, it challenges you to ponder who deserves this planet, mankind or machines?  Despite some exciting set pieces, it seems more fitting to call these movies BLADE CRAWLER.  All of this is to say, I loved it, I hated it, my world has been rocked and put to sleep by it.  It's either a masterpiece or a mess-terpiece, which, considering the dystopian present we're in, makes it one of THE movies of the year somehow!",

            "content": "Blade Runner 2049 comes 35 years after Ridley Scott's 1982 film, amid a gale of trepidation and uncertainty about whether it will improve, or even stand up to the original film, now widely recognised as an influential cult classic. Every sequel is required to prove itself worthy of its predecessor, and there is always a massive weight on the film makers' shoulders to create something which can expand the ideas, story and characters set up in the first. With Blade Runner, this was a monumental task, undertaken with little apprehension and a great deal of skill by director Denis Villeneuve. The result is, in the words of Kingsman's Taron Egerton: \"F**king spectacular\"!\n\nDenis Villeneuve (with Ridley Scott on production duties) has managed to craft a breathtaking piece of landmark cinema which lives up to the adoration fans have for the original Blade Runner (myself included), while also introducing the world to a new generation. The word \"world\" there, seems a bit out-of-place however. While Ridley Scott showed himself to be a master world-builder in 1982, Denis Villeneuve has taken Scott's world and expanded it into a fully fleshed out, living, breathing universe. This is partly down to the script and story, but can be mostly attributed to director of photography, Roger Deakins. The cinematography of 2049 bleeds with meaning and seeps beauty, and every frame is transportative and almost interactive - I am not ashamed to admit to several gasps and a stray tear here and there, due to the sheer beauty of this film, something which Villeneuve managed to pull off last year with Arrival, and which Deakins has achieved time and time again throughout his career (especially in his collaborations with Villeneuve on Sicario and Prisoners). This NEEDS to be seen on a massive screen - IMAX if you can, but just make sure it's big! Since 2049's release, many critics have said that it would be criminal for Deakins to miss out on another Oscar win. I hate to jump on the band wagon, but I may just have to on this one. Give him that bloody golden statue already!\n\nThe editing also has to be given a great deal of credit here too. 2049 has a deeper, more complex story than the original, which can twist and turn in ways which may seem slightly conventional at first, but turn out incredibly well. However, despite the rich story, 2049 does not suffer from a dearth of quiet moments. In fact, it is is edited with an almost languorous care which provides countless moments in which we can marvel at the scenery, study the characters' multifaceted expressions or simply bask in the other-worldly, reverberating score. And that score... oh boy! If you see this in IMAX, or any cinema with a fantastic sound system (which I highly recommend), be warned: your organs will be shaken, your bones will tremble, your mind WILL be blown!\n\nWhile the audience already had stakes in this movie in the shape of Harrison Ford's Deckard, we are introduced to new, deeply rich characters which capture our attention, curiosity and even our love. Gosling's \"K\", and his intriguing relationship with Ana de Armas's \"Joi\", are set against the dark and dreary backdrop of dystopian LA, and we get to explore the hellish cityscape (which, like the original, is punctuated with abrasive neon lights and drenched in acid rain) through their ever-expressive eyes. And it's the eyes which say the most in 2049, a movie which manages to say just as much with the macro (massive wide-shots taking in the scenery) as it does with the micro (intense close-ups of Gos, letting us see every single pore and pimple). Whether we're being shown eyes gouged out, or exploring the complexities of emotion through Harrison Ford's coming-to-terms with his past, the characters' eyes are truly the window into 2049's soul. \n\nHowever, while 2049 does explore very much the same themes as the original, this does not mean that we have heard all this before and there's no more to say. It's quite the opposite in fact, as 2049 expands on the questions of the first, and continues to ask what it means to be human, what we should aspire to be... and whether it really matters at all. All this is managed without the self parody or meta-awareness which was present in JJ Abrams' reboots of Star Trek and Star Wars. Nobody references the \"tears of rain\" speech and there is no mention of paper unicorns. The only moment which almost verges on fan service is a surprise cameo, which ends up being such an interesting interaction which actually serves the story, that it can't be faulted.\n\nThere is an almost nihilistic edge to the film, that the original also bore, which may be a reason for it currently not doing as well as expected at the Box Office. Perhaps, just as in 1982, the dark, introspective themes explored in Blade Runner are just not as palatable for mainstream audiences as studios would like. Perhaps, just as with the first, 2049 will become a cult classic, influencing the film makers of tomorrow, while garnering a loyal, protective fan base in the process.\n\nAfter we have said all this, about Blade Runner 2049 being an undeniable masterpiece, the big question is: is it better than the first? The knee-jerk reaction for me would be to say yes. 2049 is more swooping in scope, more intricate in detail and boasts, arguably, more emotive performances. However, we may have to wait some time to see the effect 2049 has on audiences in the years to come. Will it influence film the way Ridley Scott did in 1982, or will it simply be assigned the role of \"surprisingly good sequel\"? One thing is certain at this point: Denis Villeneuve is going on to be a fantastic, ground-breaking film maker. You sometimes hear that there aren't currently any great directors, who could have the cultural impact of such legends as Hitchcock or Kubrick. However, when we look at the work of Villeneuve with Prisoners, Sicario, Arrival and now Blade Runner, we can be sure that we are witnessing the rise of a fine film maker, who will no doubt one day be seen as one of the greats.\n-S\nVerdict: Blade Runner 2049 is a masterpiece of world-building, storytelling, editing, cinematography and acting. It's satisfying enough to watch any sequel which lives up to the original, but with something as iconic and influential as Blade Runner being given such nurtured adoration, we can't help but think we're witnessing a landmark moment in cinema. So good that even Roy Batty wouldn't believe his eyes.\n\n10/10\n\nFollow @CNSMovies17 on twitter",

Visually stunning, artistically sound (acting, vision, and narrative all coalesce very well) and respectful of its predecessor, it's a film for people who love movies in their entire conception (entertainment and art) I'm sure Kubrick would have considered it a film to be watched more than once. Without spoiling anything, this film contains a scene that will stick with me as one of the best in film, and surly the best of Harrison Ford's career. It kept me thinking about both Blade Runner films, and about loss, well after the credits rolled, and now as I write this review. I think that people are missing out on something special if they ignore this film. Blade Runner 2049 is more than just entertainment, and for people looking for only that, I still think you should give it a chance. Brilliant film, I know that I will cherish it.",

I've read comparisons between him and Spielberg, but this couldn't be further from the truth - Villeneuve seems to be focused on the 'art' of movies; all his films look spectacular, sound stunning, and are shot to perfection, but everything else seems to fall into a distant second place. BR2049 takes this to another level, because it looks *so* good, and the Hans Zimmer soundtrack is *so* amazing,  while the film is chock full of good ideas (some that work, some that don't) and the performances are decent enough (though Leto walks a fine line at times) that disparity becomes ever increasing and detracts from the movie. It's like trying to explore an art gallery while simultaneously reading a good book - it doesn't work.\n\nAs for the run-time; I didn't mind it, but it is unquestionably glacially paced. Certain scenes did feel unnecessarily overlong for the sake of it, but I will take that, as it was a refreshing change from the over-edited cutting of most modern flicks. The few action scenes do benefit from this, in that you can actually tell what is happening on-screen, which surprisingly is not always the case with modern cinema (Michael Bay) but the run-time could have been significantly reduced (The original hovered around the two hour mark).\n\nSpeaking of the original - the best thing I can say about this sequel, is, although it is distinctly a Denis Villeneuve film (whether that is a good or bad thing is down to personal taste) it does feel part of the Blade Runner universe, and a biotic continuation of the first film. Villeneuve seems to understand what made the first film great, and while adding his own touches to proceedings, he does rely on the guts of that film for the core here - an example being the soundtrack - it has those rumbles he is renowned for, but there is some Vangelis-esque tones in there. It builds life from the DNA of it's predecessor, rather than replicating it (no pun intended) but tells it's own story.",

The gritty asian inspired film noir atmosphere crafted in the original has been replaced by a slick Hollywood-ized revisioning....that comes across as empty.  Not to dwell on the asian influences of the original but where did all the asian people go?  There is also the issue of a somewhat sexist portrayal of women.  \nUltimately the story felt hollow, convoluted, and the ending was clearly unresolved (why was Jared Leto even in the movie?).

After last night's view I am still in shock and astounded by the masterpiece I had the privilege to witness. I am absolutely delighted how Hollywood allowed Deni Villeneuve to direct his work without inserting formulaic shallow mindless action clips to satisfy the new ADD generation. Firstly the cinematography alone is worth more than the admission price, if Deacons does not win an Oscar for this then he never will. The casting and performances are superb beyond words, K's brief moments of emotion explosive in intensity. This is an incredibly sad story with strong messages about racism, humanity and the pointless cycle of violence. As violent as 2049 is it is visually quite mild compared to Scott's BR, revealing Villeneuve's disdain for gratuitous such. Non the less it does not make the scenes of violence any less intense as he is a master at conveying atmospheres of terror without patently showing it. I don't even know were to begin at just how multi layered and complex the story is, even at the generously slow pacing I at many times struggled to keep up and process all the information. The scenes of death and conflict explode with such intensity it's heartbreakingly visceral. In many ways I can see in this work what Ridley Scott so wanted to film but was restricted due to technical and budgetary constraints, noticeably K's retirement of Sapper at the protein farm. No dialogue wasted in this script and each fragment of info revealed vital to understanding the story. This will be a frustrating movie for any casual viewer hoping for some spoon fed escapism, action and wit. Box office sales ratings mean nothing here, see Emoji movie, enough said. I've run out of space. BR 2049 so good it made me cry...",

From the director of Arrival and Sicario, this sequel set up 30 years after the original film is a rare continuation that sticks well to its thematic elements, with Villeneuve's direction of unnerving calm throughout the film that slowly expanding the universe, exploring and further synthesising the sensibility between human and mechanics. There are flaws, perhaps the two main complaints would be its unexpectedly loose ending and a running time of 163 minutes that certainly challenges the patience of audiences. Not to expect action packed or fantasy, it is a total pure, detailed and quiet science fiction carrying the significance moral dilemma of cyber punk future in a haunting, beautifully engineered and aurally spectacular visual effects as well as serene yet compelling scores from Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch which fit the atmosphere perfectly. Great chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford further enhances the viewing experience, though the entire film actually acts as a divisive art crafted for a niche of serious moviegoers who would truly enjoy its deeply resonant philosophy.",

'cause it's long, while pretty, but boring). slow. kinda predictable. also bleak. frustrating. corny-ish ending (also like, \"so what?\" was how i felt at the end). story seems a bit holey. beautiful casting and acting, but that's as expected as sharp/best-in-class cinematography & DP-ing (directing photography, lighting, shots, CG, etc. -\u00a0like you wouldn't eat at a shabby or crappy looking restaurant if you had an option, and who would want to intentionally create a crappy LOOKING restaurant, maybe the food on the menu is just not as great as the place looks, which happens)  ...maybe the writing/screenplay/plot could have used some work (though unfortunately nothing new, same achilles' heel as other floppy releases from recent and past). love a good sci-film. this one is just like rrreally pretty (like \"porn for artists\" as one YouTube commenter put it), and while certainly inspiring in the looks department, nothing new here, not ahead of it's time, and not really thought-provoking. the robots/replicants/non-humans having a soul or wanting to love is a story that also seems to be well-trodden (like Kubrick/Spielberg's \"AI\", \"Pinocchio\", or \"Humans\" the TV series on like AMC, even if there's the element of procreation here, i'm sure that's being done in some other past work or whatever). maybe more plot twists? i was really digging ryan gosling's outfit and the fight scene between him and the lady in like the ocean at the end. love to watch some ass kicking. establishing shots were lit (meaning sweet), but like whatever. like, next? good story, please? i want to be thrilled if a team of people are gonna spend like $200 million in 2016/17 on an A-list film production.",

            "content": "\"Blade Runner 2049\" is drop dead gorgeous. I cannot count how many times I looked at the film in awe of what was on screen. Each of these shots, backed up by a loud, fantastic sci-fi score, is destined to amaze each viewer. It is no doubt that the film is directed perfectly. However, the direction is clouded by a simple plot and an very long run time. While \"Blade Runner 2049\" tries to expand on the 1982 classic, it falls due to a near 3 hours run time and a lackluster story.\n\nThe film begins with Officer K (Ryan Gosling) flying over to a farm owned by a Nexus 6 replicant. Officer K, a replicant Blade Runner of the LAPD, is sent over to \"retire\" the owner, which leads to a brutal battle between the two of them. In the aftermath, Officer K scans the rest of the area to find a box buried deep below a tree. This would lead to a box of bones, leading Officer K to question who he really is and what his purpose is. Without going into too much detail (aka minor spoiler), the initial investigation in the box of bones hints that replicants may be able to reproduce. This leads to a collision course between Niander Wallace (Jared Leto), a replicant manufacturer who has built them to obey commands, and Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a former LAPD Blade Runner who has been missing for 30 years.\n\nIf you are confused by that last paragraph, I will assume that you have never watched the 1982 \"Blade Runner.\" It is imperative that you watch the first film before seeing \"Blade Runner 2049.\" While the film does give some background, it acts as more of a refresher for viewers who have already seen the first film. There are flashbacks to the original film but only viewers who have seen the film will truly understand their significance.\n\nWhile there are some high points in the film (direction, score, acting), they are clouded by an overstretched plot. The plot itself is interesting. The major aspect that damages the story is the run time. In shot, this is a two hour plot that takes nearly 3 hours to finish. At least one-third of the film is padded with fluff that should have been cut out of the final version of the film. One example is the weird sex scene between Officer K, his holographic wife, and a prostitute. While I understand Director Denis Villeneuve was trying to create a visual spectacle - as well as develop Officer K's character - but the scene lasted five minutes longer than what it needed to be. There are a few more instances like this that do not affect the storyline that could have been cut.\n\nAnother mixed reaction is the use of Harrison Ford in the film. It is understandable that Ford's presence in the film helps advertise the film to new audiences, his character was not needed. The plot did not need his character in the film. While it was great to see Deckard return for the second film, his appearance is limited. With the character physically in the film for only 45 of the film makes me question if the addition of Deckard was more for promoting the film than a necessity for the story. It would have been easier if the film stuck to flashbacks rather than a full appearance from Deckard.\n\n\"Bade Runner 2049\" was a disappointment. Clocking in at 164 minutes, the film is too long for a plot that only needed two-thirds of that run time to complete. The film is directed beautifully. However, a beautiful film cannot hide a long run time and a less-than complicated plot.\n\nGrade: D+",

With mood and aesthetic sitting front and center in the original, the creative challenge for 2049 must have been daunting. To the rescue comes a strong script, that manages to increase the emotional heft of the plot, without dropping the stark bleak nature of it all. Quite a feat. Entering the film's final act, thoughts of 'instant classic' began to run through my brain. But when it came time to tie the bow, it just wasn't tight enough. Perhaps one subplot too many.  Or for some, too open-ended of a finish (but if you've seen the original, you shouldn't have expected anything else).  What makes the best parts of these movies great is the sense of openness spewed out across a desolate canvas. Simple, but deep. Intense, but meditative. Cold, but emotional. Hence, it does not wear additional clutter well. Thankfully, it doesn't stray too far. It's a big budget movie that has retained its art house panache. And a sequel that doesn't sell out to new generation expectations. Which is why like the original, its pinnacle success is likely cult status, yet again. It's an artistic badge of honor. Bravo.",

He thinks that every frame is so important, that the film plods a bit and could use some ruthless editing.  Blade Runner 2049 is a new classic. The Benjamin Wallfisch/Hans Zimmer score is perfectly in keeping with the Vangelis sound from the original. The whole sound design is a wonder to take in. The visuals, both practical and computer generated, are spectacular. It had to be a temptation to grab the extra box office $ by filming for 3D, but nothing is lacking without it. All the technical aspects are done well in service of the story. The large scale of the film never loses itself in technology over story, and that story is human at its core. The 30+ years that have elapsed since the original Blade Runner are well served in a great mystery story.  Everyone is perfectly cast, including Ryan Gosling as K and Sylvia Hoeks as evil replicant Luv. Harrison Ford puts a little extra cement into his status as an American film icon. Dave Bautista is obviously serious about his acting craft, and I for one am ready to see him take on some lead roles. I have no qualms in calling this one of the best films of the year. Vegas Baby!",

I was hoping to have a truly epic sci-fi experience that honors the original but also stands on its own.  While 2049 does that, it still isn't resonating with me the way I think it does with most people.\n\nI honestly can't pinpoint the reason why I'm not connecting to these films.  Great performances, beautiful cinematography, visceral action (in the limited action sequences), and a director at the top of his game, and I'm still not connecting the dots as to why these movies are viewed with such high regard.  Granted, Roger Deakins' cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen.  Gosling, Ford, and the rest of the ensemble all fit perfectly with their characters (see - Jared Leto for example).  Villeneuve proposes some fantastic story beats that definitely separate this film thematically from the original (which was a worry I had), and yet I'm still not all the way there.\n\nI think the thing that kills me with both films is the pacing.  It's not like I haven't seen science fiction films with slow pacing that I liked. Heck, Villeneuve made a great one just last year with Arrival.  But there's something about how slow these films play and the material that drives them just doesn't resonate with me.  Whether it's the overabundance of A.I driven sci-fi features that I've seen before these movies, the bleak tone, or the fact that I just don't really care whether or not Rick Deckard is a replicant or not, Blade Runner just isn't for me.\n\nWith that said, I can always appreciate when a film is sharply put together.  Just because I'm not a fan of the material, doesn't mean I can't see when a film is something special in the technical way.  If there was ever a guy who should win the Oscar for cinematography, it's Roger Deakins.  The man has gone on long enough without a statue.  And there's nothing I can knock too much about Villeneuve's directing, even with an incredibly slow burn way of telling a story.  I thought Gosling and Ford played well off each other, and gave some of the more emotional turns I've seen from either of them in quite some time.  And the eerie but lively score from Ben Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer are among this year's best.\n\nHowever overall, I can't see myself sitting down for a second viewing.  I'm perfectly content with letting other people enjoy this series.  I won't blame anyone for calling this or the original a classic.  But I'll pass.\n\n7.1/10",

            "content": "For a modern big budget film, this one was OK. However, it failed to evoke any feelings whatsoever. A dissection below.\n\nGood things first. The movie is visually brilliant. It is believably rough and dirty where it needs to be, and stunningly beautiful when the story allows more artful scenes. There are some good acting performances (Harrison Ford, Dave Bautista (!), Barkhad Abdi). The basic plot is OK, one could build a very good movie around it. I very much liked how the movie handled the theme of relationships and contemplated to what extent AI could replace a physical partner. And the direct references and links to the original Blade Runner movie were very clever and graceful, they did not feel like fan service at all but natural and integral parts of this movie.\n\nWhy did it fail to evoke any emotions, then? (Disclaimer: most of the reasons are probably due to personal preferences, very subjective. Your experience may be completely different.)\n\nOne issue was the editing and pacing of the film. Pacing worked very well in the beginning, but the flow was lost somewhere in the middle, and the latter half of the movie was stagnant on several occasions, losing its grip of the viewer as a result. There were also a couple of occasions where despite the tranquil pace the movie failed to present key plot developments in a clear manner -- what exactly happened, why something was done, or how did we end up in this situation from the end of the last related scene.\n\nSecond issue was a combination of casting and screen writing. Ryan Gosling is a solid actor, but perhaps best suited to sympathetic heartthrob roles; in my opinion he lacks the kind of rugged charisma and screen presence that would be needed for playing this kind of role with such vast screen time. However, the role is extremely challenging -- to function as a focal point of the whole movie he should be identifiable, charismatic, memorable; on the other hand he should convincingly portray a machine without a free will whose job is to kill his own kind. Gosling makes a brave effort, but the end result is bland. The antagonists are simply trite. Jared Leto is miscast, stale at best and atrocious at worst; instead of a menacing, wildly ambitious genius he comes off as a fledgling cult leader who is practicing his first sermons. However, the actor was not given much to work with, the whole character is but a dim imitation of Dr. Eldon Tyrell from the first Blade Runner movie. Sylvia Hoeks does a good job with what she was given, but again, it was not much: the writers resorted to the cheapest B movie trope and imply that the bad guys are bad by making them use violence as the first and only solution to every problem, and Hoeks' character was not given any nuances apart from a sadistic streak that seems odd in a machine.\n\nFinally, there was the soundscape of the movie. This film is practically devoid of emotional music. Sounds consist mostly of thunderous rumbles and shrill synth sounds instead of real melodies; there is also a Shepard tone playing during one key scene. Absence of emotionally manipulative soundtrack is often nothing but a positive thing, but it also means that the movie has one less tool to convey and evoke feelings with. In this case, the drab and monotonous score enhances all the wrong qualities of the film.",

This is a problem Ridley Scott has with most of his recent \"revisits\"-- for \"Alien\" and now this, as he has more interest in franchising than creating and telling solid stories. He's shamelessly and overtly trying to seduce and lure audiences with razzle-dazzle, all too willing to overstuff with redundant beauty at expense of effective, powerful plot and character development. \nDuring this movie, I kept asking myself  how many gorgeous, sweeping, flying over the city shots did this plot and story really need? \nWhy were certain characters introduced for only a second or given minimal screen time instead of being emphasized as they were originally intended (they were set decoration, quite obviously!)\n There were subplots that could have been emphasized more as part of the world-building and would have been far more intriguing than some of the gratuitous relationship scenes (one scene i can understand to get a point across in world-building, but after awhile, they become excessive and obvious fluff, dragging the storytelling pace just to maximize commercial running time......)...... \nand Gosling is waaaaay overrated as an actor. I'm not buying into the hype about his subtle, cool charm....  Styrofoam has more charisma than him. As an emotionless \"straight-man\" for events to happen around, he works because he can't move out of a wooden persona, but the cynicism and apathy that Ford brought to the original character shows why Ford deserved(s) movie-star status and some folks (like Gosling) must have made a Faustian deal somewhere along the way....",

For me and my husband especially, it was confusing but maybe on purpose. Kind of like a puzzle you have to figure out. Great acting and let's just say I like the Elvis part the best :-).

Gosling is the focus but his character moves this film and a good thing as the story isn't as tight as the original Blade Runner and I feel as if there were loose threads around when 2049 ended.  The themes and supporting cast don't live up to it either.  Tried to continue the \"what is human\" question but in a more muddled way.

Overlooking some of the minor continuity problems or unexplained oddities (such as why there are no receptionists, guards, or janitorial staff at the enclosure of the memory maker). The film only lags in comparison to the first and has the definite feel of a mid-trilogy second installment.  What it lacks in action, it makes up for in character portrayal and AI plotting. The sets are larger and even more moodily enveloping, and the booming and bass thrumming music plays a role of its own much like the chorus of a classical Greek tragedy.   What was originally a humans-vs-replicants conflict is now a three-cornered conflict of humans-vs-replicants-vs-replicants with humans being sidelined to the third rate power player in the game.  Thus for those seeking the tight action driven detective noir of the first film there may be some disappointment, as the detecting here is more slowly revealing. However, the promise at the end is the set up for a third installment in which the allegiances between humans and replicants must necessarily shift if intelligence itself is to survive in either human or artificial capacity.",

This is from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, and he has style and technique for days.  The visuals are astonishing, the sound editing, design and accompanying music are standout, and the cinematography is nothing short of stellar (Roger Deakins isn't exactly a lightweight).  Blade Runner 2049 is a movie that does everything right in gathering all of the pieces that should make for a terrific movie, but all of those pieces of the puzzle never quite fit together, for me at the very least.  It works in individual scenes, but never on the whole.  It makes it very clear that it is not following the same twist of its predecessor in letting you know that K already knows that he is a replicant within the first fifteen minutes, which is something that I ended up appreciating; so many sequels just hit the same exact beats as their predecessor, so it was nice to see that not happen here.  The story sets itself up to be a commentary on the state of artificial intelligence and where it is headed in the future with the relationship with K and his software created girlfriend (Ana de Armas), and that was what I ended up being most interested in.  While it does eventually circle back around to that, you can tell very early on that this is not the main point to the story.  There are also opportunities presented to make this a discrimination story between humans and \"skinjobs\" as they call them, but that is dropped pretty quickly as well.  It is all really just unraveling this case which is a process in a movie that features a runtime that is already on the intimidating side.  This is a story that takes itself very seriously, and despite all of the top of the line special effects and visuals, it still feels drab because this is a world where nobody can crack a joke, never mind a smile, which is not a problem I ever had with the original.  The majority of characters in this are robots, so there is a monotone baseline that doesn't give a lot of emotional range.  I never really connected with it, and much like Mad Max: Fury Road, I found myself appreciating this more than enjoying it, despite almost every one of my peers losing their mind over a sequel that stayed true to the original property.  I can't take away from the visual flair that this features, because it is some of the most incredible eye candy you will see all year, but for me, personally, this is a beautiful movie that you can have on in the background of a party.",

That would have been an impossible expectation. Is it a worthy sequel? Oh yeah.\n\nRidley Scott and company recapture and portray a Blade Runner universe years into the future perfectly. The tone is perfectly Blade Runner, while not being a cheap knockoff. Additionally, they add perfectly to that universe with more tidbits and realities that the original movie didn't cover.\n\nRidley Scott's visual story telling in on huge display throughout this epic film and is a complete feast for the eyes. Ryan Gossling and Robin Wright are worthy successors to Harrison Ford and M. Emmet Walsh, while Sylvia Hoeks is on fire as the virtual intimate, Luv.\n\nSo why not 5 stars you ask? The movie drags. Two of Ridley Scott's biggest downsides are on display here; overly long and not particularly relevant cinematic pans and not knowing what to put on the cutting room floor. At two hours and forty five minutes, this movie FEELS like a long movie and that's unfortunate because it really is a great movie. But 30 to 45 minutes of this film could've easily been whacked off imo,\n\nHaving said that, great film go see it in the big theater NOW!",

            "content": "Blade Runner 2049 is a well-acted (thank Zeus!), slow-paced (not in a negative way) and methodical exploration into what it means to be human (which is not a novel idea, but is welcomed, yet again, in this movie). And most importantly, it's believable (or so I believe).\n\nWritten by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green\nDirected by Denis Villeneuve \n\nThe movie has a long run-time of 2 hours and 42 minutes. I'm certain this will discourage some people to watch, and others to become bored. Although the length is noticeable to a degree, but I believe it's one of the factors that makes this movie feel real and authentic. Too many movies nowadays have rushed dialogue and quick scenes which leads to leaps in continuity negatively affecting the story overall. There are many scenes here that take their time (long-takes), allowing you to take in the setting, feel its presence. I believe this is a great attribute because it helps you to be more immersed in the cinematic world being set-up and allows for characters to reveal their intricacies.\n\nThe performances, even from the supporting cast, are superb and wholly believable (which I always try to impress is THE most important factor in a movie--if you don't believe what you're watching, you won't like it [although everyone's degree of \"suspension of disbelief\" varies so greatly that this statement is truly subjective.... for this statement to be applied universally, I suspect most people w). However, I will say, although I love Ryan Gosling's acting I would have appreciated seeing him incorporate a few more idyisyncrasies into his character (K), but I suspect the lack thereof was indeed the point (I'm sure I will decide which is the case once I view it a second time). It was certainly a pleasure to see the nuanced acting from the cast.\n\nAlthough the movie asks the much-used question \"what does it mean to be Human?\", it doesn't feel redundant (although I admit, I'm typically accepting of such stories no matter how many iterations we've gotten--as long as they're executed well). It's not at all heavy handed or self-righteous in any way. I would say it has a rough elegance in its exploration of the notion.\n\nThe movie's cinematography is beautiful! I had a great sense of the world through the wide, open shots of the environments the story travels through (I always believe long-takes, wide-open and vast aerial shots help construct a more believable and realized world setting). It is due to these tactics that the world the director sets up feels genuine. The environments also never felt like they were film sets, sound stages or simply staged in any sense which also speaks to the talent involved with the special effects and cgi. Like to few movies these days, the special effects and CGI is integrated perfectly, creating a beautiful world that feels one-hundred percent genuine. I left the theatre feeling as if I had watched a documentary from the future showcasing what California (and the United States for that matter) is going to be like in the future (and it's not that optimistic).\n\n\nAs far as the relationship between this and the first installment, I believe it seamlessly integrates so well that it appears as if  2049 is a replica of the other (in tone and vision, not to imply it's a carbon copy). I truly felt I was watching an extension of the first installment. One thing I loved about this movie is its \"use\" of Harrison Ford. Now, I'm not a HUGE fan of his, so I don't usually perk up for his cinematic appearances (truthfully, when I realized he was going to be in the film I thought, \"Great. Another movie harping on the past by having its former star reprising\"), but I thought his presence was an asset to the story (if you've seen it this is obvious) and necessary for the plot to further. I don't believe he was over-used in the slightest. \n\nThe dialogue was also very well-written. I didn't scoff or roll my eyes during anyone's speech or \"one-liner\". Although I'm sure some people will disagree with me a little, as certain characters' rhythm of speech and dialogue is unconventional, that it may feel awkward at times, but I believe that is why it's successful. There are billions of us...and certainly, we do not all speak alike. \n\nI would say the music was at times very loud, but that may vary depending on the theatre and type of showing. The music was certainly unique and very eerie sounding, which I loved.\n\nOverall I would say the movie was well-paced and never felt contrived. It certainly never felt rushed and you \"live\" long enough with Ryan Gosling's character (K) to understand who he is and what motivates him. The plot unravels at a natural and leisurely pace and I never found myself asking why in the hell a character did \"XYZ\". All the character's motivations were clear and reasonable enough to logically progress the film in an organic way.\n\nThis is certainly the type of film you can watch over and over, catching all the subtleties you missed in the first viewing. There is so much to appreciate about this movie. I will certainly be buying this Blu-ray.",

Blade Runner showed a dark dingy world where technology advanced unevenly. The original left us guessing. 2049 is someplace we now know well. It's no longer a unique vision of the future.

Spoilers are in the lower part of the text so if you are avoiding spoilers, don't read.  :)\n\nNon-Spoiler Review:  An excellent movie. The imagery was just astounding.  The direction and cinematography were perfect though they don't match the look and feel of the original in every way, which is a little off-putting if you've just seen the original before watching 2049.  \nThe acting *much* better than what you see in the 1982 original.  God knows Harrison Ford hasn't emoted so much in any role in the last 30 years. And Gosling was outstanding; I really don't get the reservations so many people seemed to have when it was announced he was going to be starring.  Ana de Armas (Joi) was wonderful. Robin Wright played Robin Wright excellently as always. \n\nI felt Jared Leto was a weak link in the cast. And I say that as someone who really liked his Joker in Suicide Squad.  And given how (over)used he was this is a real problem with the movie. Sadly, Sylvia Hoeks (Luv) is no Rutger Hauer (assuming she was intended to take that role, which isn't necessarily so and that also is a problem). More on my thoughts about the antagonist(s) below in the Spoilery Comments.\n\nThere was, thankfully, no sexual assault/rape scene passed off as a seduction like there was in the original.  -.-  \n\n2049 falls short of the original Blade Runner in several categories. But comparing it to the original is a really high bar. It's no shame that it falls a bit short. That still makes it one hell of a good movie.\n\nI give it a 9/10 and would absolutely recommend it.  Go see it at the big screen. The bigger the better.\n\n*******************************\n\nSpoilery comments:\n\nHmm.  Okay, I liked it a lot.  So I'll just mention the things I *didn't* like and you can assume I liked everything else. :)\n\n1.  The soundtrack isn't anywhere near the original genius work of Vangelis.  It's okay. But that's all it is.  There's not *one* single tune in the entire movie I can think of.  It's all generic background movie music. It could have been the soundtrack to any sci-fi movie. That makes it a disappointment considering how awesome the original soundtrack was and how impactful it was as part of the movie.\n\n2.  The lack of a great antagonist really hurts the movie in comparison to the original. There flat out isn't any character that's the equivalent of Roy Batty.  There's not even a character that's written to try to be this movie's Roy. That hurts the movie a lot.  I could go on about this problem but I think I've made my point. \n\n3.  For that matter there isn't even an antagonist that's the equal of Pris (Daryl Hannah).  I will give full props to Dave Bautista in his small role as a old style Tyrrell Replicant. Though if I'd not watched the 10 minute short feature with his character in it before watching 2049 I don't know that I'd have cared nearly as much about his character or his scene. And that's a problem.\n\n4.  Jared Leto plays a character that's the equivalent of the original movie's Dr. Eldon Tyrrell.  Yet Leto gets as much screen time and dialogue as Rutger Hauer's Roy.\nWhy? \n\nLeto's Niander Wallace isn't the character who Roy Batty was. He's more or less the antagonist of 2049 but they do a poor job of establishing his motivations or even his goals. Not impossible to figure out what he's doing but it's not real clear. It was extremely clear what the antagonists of the original movie were after.  It's not so clear what Wallace is doing and if he IS the primary antagonist we're left with absolutely no closure with him. The end of the movie happens and it feels like Luv was the primary antagonist. And there's even less development of her motivations and goals. \n\nSo, yeah, they did a really weak job of presenting an antagonist to drive the conflict that drives the plot. Even Robin Wright seems like the antagonist for a while.  This is the biggest flaw in the movie imo.\n\n5.  The plot is okay, but only okay. It suffers in comparison to the original, which was an exceptionally simple linear plot, which was why it worked.\n\nThe plot of this movie ends up being (and keep in mind that the audience doesn't even know that this is the plot until two hours of the movie have elapsed):\n\n\"Some people are hunting down Deckard because he can maybe lead them to his daughter he had with Rachel, who was a Replicant. That she gave birth and was a Tyrrell Replicant is a really big deal so some people really want to find the kid and some other people, mostly Replicants, want to keep her hidden for unclear reasons.\"\n\nThat just doesn't work nearly as well as Blade Runner's plot did imo.  And, again, that it's not clear that this is the plot until over 2 hours of the movie have gone by doesn't help.  For most of the movie the plot seems to be:\n\n\"Agent K, a character study, and him investigating something mysterious.  We know it's mysterious because we're told that it's mysterious.\"\n\nThe plot doesn't suck. But it isn't what it should have been imo.  And I easily imagine many people walked out without the ability to summarize the plot of the movie and imo that's not a good thing. Novels are great for oblique stories. Movies are less than 3 hours. It's a good idea to go with a straightforward, simple, plot.\n\n6.  The relationship between Officer K and Joi was an excellent part of the movie. So I've got a GIANT wtf with them just killing her off and basically that's it? One little bit about her in the third act, practically at the denouement of the film, but nothing else??\n\nI was *quite* disappointed in how her and K's story was handled by the end of the second act. By the time they leave Vegas that's IT for their story minus the one short bit near the end.\n\nI was not pleased by this.\n\n*******************************\n\nWell, that's the low points I think. Like I said I liked the movie. But... I might have enjoyed it just as much if it had been 2 hours of non-storytelling clips of 2049 LA and the other sets with the actors walking around emoting things plus the soundtrack.\n\nAnd that's something of a problem if you ask me.",

Ana de Armas is heartbreaking is a role you just have to see, while Harrison Ford gives the film the perfect level of gravitas when he finally appears.  Behind the camera, director Denis Villeneuve makes a love letter to the original film, with beautiful shots showing off the dystopian future while further exploring what it means to be human.  The film even technically improves on the original in that the story is easy to follow in it just starting out as a straight detective story.  It is long at 2 hours & 44 minutes, but you never feel it as every shot is intoxicating.  The only downside is somewhat anti-climatic ending, though it ends with the perfect emotional punch, making a film that is quite possibly the equal to the original, if not better.

Of course it needs a sequel - and that will either show it to be a bunch of lame coincidences, or a superbly well-scripted meditation on the nature of life, consciousness, destiny, and maybe even love. Several set pieces were brilliantly executed (Elvis + Showgirls; a shot with the hologram of Sinatra in front of Baroque and Renaissance paintings backed up by a set of books - what is image, what is life? What is the difference?, and s superb three-way sex scene). The film also neatly treads between the poles established in the theatrical release (1980) and the Director's Cut (1994?). The unexplained details presented (LA has moved from dreary, rainy, Asian-dominated hellhole to a dreary, half-frozen, red-skyed pseudo-Soviet hellhole) are superbly left unexplained: the characters live in this world - they do not explain it to us.\n\nMy personal favorite exchange:\nK: Is he real?\nD: Ask *him*.\n\nGonna see it again and I demand the concluding sequel.",

            "content": "Blade Runner is one of my all-time favourite movies. I've loved it since my first viewing and I had very high hopes for 2049 and the movie delivered on every level. The plot was kept a secret from every single trailer and even the reviewers were asked not to reveal anything about the plot. But, I do plan on talking about the movie in detail, so I will put a SPOILER alert right here at the start. Only read further if you've watched the movie. Here we go. The plot revolves around a blade runner who goes by the name K. He's a new \"breed\" of replicants which have a normal life-span and his job is to hunt down older versions of replicants and \"retire\" them. In the beginning we see him do just that with Sapper. Sapper was introduced back in 2036: Nexus Dawn, a short movie released before 2049. He's an old version of a replicant, he even fought on Calantha, and must therefore be retired, killed. Upon investigating around his house, K finds a buried locker. In the locker, there are bones of a replicant who gave birth. A lot of people thought this movie was going to focus on Deckard, but the real focus of the movie is actually his child. The remains found in the locker are actually that of Rachel, from the original Blade Runner. This sets off K on a dangerous and important investigation. Since the first movie never actually revealed Deckard as a replicant, I was a bit afraid this sequel was going to tell us if he is or isn't one, which would ruin the 35 year old mystery. Thankfully, we're, again, not given a straight answer! Some might be really frustrated by that, though. Tyrell Corp. is also gone, as seen in the Black Out 2022 short anime movie, and a new mastermind replaced Tyrell. Wallace, played perfectly by Jared Leto, is a new breeder of replicants who considers them his children, angels. He doesn't have a lot of screentime and he doesn't actually do much in the movie, but his presence was always intense and his dialogue is very thought-provoking, especially during the scene where we witness a birth of a replicant. Wallace Corp. also looks breathtakingly beautiful! The whole structure of the building is made to look like a pyramid and the inside is fully golden yellow/black. The main \"meeting room\" where Wallace always has talks with his angel Luv and, later, with Deckard, is extraordinary. The light is always moving in a circle and the shadows keep changing as the light moves. It's extremely hard to explain this, but if you've seen the movie then you know what I'm talking about. It's gorgeous. The archives, also in Wallace Corp., look breathtaking. I adore every single shot that takes place in that building. Ryan Gosling plays K, a replicant blade runner, perfectly! My favourite scene with him was when he was looking for the child in an orphanage. To add some context here, every replicant has a certain memory implanted in him to make him seem more human. K only remembers one thing. As a child, he had a wooden horse toy with something imprinted on the back of it and some kids wanted to take it away from him so he ran from them and hid the toy in one of the broken furnaces. As K is looking for information about the child in the orphanage, he realizes this is the place that he remembers as a child. After a few minutes of exploring, he actually finds the wooden horse hidden in the furnace which leads to a very devastating scene accompanied by one of the soundtrack's best tracks. It's a very haunting scene because this makes K think that he is that child and being that child will only bring him sadness as he will be hunted for the rest of his life. He realizes the danger of it and breaks down. It was truly heart-wrenching. Another scene that mesmerized me just like this one did was the one where he goes to a woman who makes these memories to see if his memory is real. She takes a look at his memory and tears start coming down her face as K sits there with zero movement, only his eyes getting watery and red. She says that someone did live this memory and that it's real. K, again, breaks down and the emotions that his character was feeling were so well potrayed by Gosling that I'm not even going to be surprised if he gets nominated for an Oscar this year. Harrison Ford reprised his role of Rick Deckard in 2049. The introduction to his character was glorious! Again, the visual style of the place where Deckard lives was out of this world. I can't praise the movie enough regarding the direction and cinematography. I'm not going to say anything about Deckard and what he does in this movie because I really do not want to spoil anything regarding his story. I'll just say that it was very emotional and very satisfying. The ending, especially, was beautifully realized. I'm in awe at how perfectly everything concluded. The CGI is wonderful! Nothing ever looked fake, not one single thing. Everything looked unusually realistic and there were times where I just stared at the screen without even realising I haven't blinked for minutes. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and  Benjamin Wallfisch is a bliss. It's very reminiscent of the Vangelis soundtrack for Blade Runner and it was perfect! I got goosebumps every single time that deep synth kicked in. It's most certainly best experienced in a cinema, though. I can't wait for this movie to come out on blu-ray so I can watch it again and again and again. All in all, Blade Runner 2049 is a phenomenal movie that completely blew me away and I couldn't recommend seeing this movie more. Truly one of a kind movie and something you don't see very often coming to cinemas. It's basically a 200 million dollar art movie and with its epic length of 2 hours and 40 minutes, I was surprised at how short it actually was! I think a lot of \"mainstream\" audiences will dislike this movie for being boring, long and not action-heavy. As soon as I walked out of the cinema, I could hear a woman behind me saying how she slept through half of the movie. It makes me feel kind of sad that extraordinary movies, like this one, get hated on so much by casual moviegoers. Oh well, just got to get used to that. Still, 2049 is currently the movie of the year for me and I couldn't be happier with it.",

It still captured the tone, atmosphere and essence of the original movie but expanding the universe posing more questions. It was visually spectacular and immersive, taking a hypnotic hold over the viewer. But I had to take of 1 star off the review over the pace and lengthy of the movie. In this day and age of shrinking attention spans and blockbuster movies at breakneck speed, this will definitely put off general moviegoers. Which is a shame given this movie is so relevant for the current times and poses the fundamental question of what it means to be human. If this movie had been released 40-50yrs ago, it would have had an interval and would be a classic. But I still recommend people be patient and watch this movie as they do not make sci-fi movies like this anymore.",

For the most part the story is strong and interesting enough to watch all the way through, but what shines most is the sound, from the very beginning it's the first thing you notice and its empowered presence holds all the way through the film. The ambient sounds mix in with the score to create a whole new experience of film and sound, the film manages to find a sweet spot where the sound resonated throughout your body but didn't distract from the film's story and visual brilliance. The impact sounds of the high intensity scenes made each bullet shot sound deliberate and powerful, and the scenes that were crafted for build up used very particular tones that would make your whole body tingle... This is definitely a contender for best score, but direction was also equally amazing. The visuals live up to the story as Villeneuve  lives up to the same Noir style from the original Blade Runner, but brings his own impact as some scenes lacked colour purposefully other scenes were so color filled you could feel as if your were staring into a neon light. It's that balance of sound and visual artistry that makes this film not just a story, but an unprecedented audio-visual experience! I had a similar experience in Villeneuve's Arrival but nothing of this intensity and precision. Hands down this is the best movie of the year, and so far the best movie I've experienced in my life.",

The plot is equally simplistic but the tone is far more serious but without much of the complexity and likeability to characters. The pacing is horrendous and brings the greater attributes (visuals, score, ai and other futuristic interpretations) down. It's also not as unique and quirky as the original. Two of the more interesting actors (Harrison Ford and Jared Leto) are completely underutilized while most of the more prominently featured stars I could've cared less for but soak up the screen time. Gosling is an exception but even his character isn't as fleshed out as a protagonist should be. Lastly, the fights are less eventful than the original's, which also weren't the best.",

            "content": "\"Sometimes to love someone, you got to be a stranger.\"\n----------MILDLY SPOILERY REVIEW----------\nI write this as unseasonal rain and thunderstorms make my window panes shudder.\nHuman beings should probably be called just 'beings'. We aren't human, if the two Blade Runner movies are anything to go by.\nAs is always the case with Denis Villeneuve films, this isn't your run-of-the-mill pewpew sci-fi extravaganza. It's a meditative experience. A lot of sci-fi films tend to show Artificial Intelligence as the 'evil side' - they're mostly black-and-white stereotypes. Not in the Blade Runner universe. The best part is you cannot compare Part 1 with 2 - they both stand together as one. Villeneuve, along with Deakins and Zimmer/Wallfisch, ensure that we don't have to leave the Scott/Vangelis/Cronenworth universe even while enjoying a new tale.\nThe story in a nutshell - K (Ryan Gosling) is a Blade Runner. But he's also a new breed of 'replicant', a bioengineered human being designed to only obey orders. His task is to seek out older replicants gone rogue, and to 'retire' (read: terminate) them. Along the way, he has to deal with the enigmatic new head of the Tyrell Corporation, Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) and his replicant enforcer Luv (whose hairstyle matches Rachel, Tyrell's replicant and Deckard's lover). He also has to deal with 'Madam' Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright). To keep him company at home is an Artificial Intelligence who goes by the name 'Joi' (played by the gorgeous Ana de Armas). K happens to discover a secret that could shake the very foundation of the world they're living in - and that forms the basis of the plot. Watch the film to get the rest, I implore you.\nWhile there are obvious nods to the original, the beauty lies in the way Villeneuve has chosen to execute those exact moments. There is a beautiful rendition of 'Tears in Rain' at some point in the film that, while not as powerful as the original, will certainly make you shed a tear or two. There is also a slightly left-field reference to Philip K Dick's novel, but I'll leave that for you to find out.\nTo allow us to fully grasp the meaning of such easter eggs and the themes, the screenplay by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green moves at a leisurely pace. The comparisons to Tarkovsky weren't unfounded - there are quite a few long, silent takes (Deakins is your best friend here, he makes the whole film look like a bloody work of art - you barely feel the length of the takes), almost as if Villeneuve wants to you understand the impact of the moment, and the decisions of the characters, before moving on to the next scene. There are important questions about what humanity is, and what the value of a memory is - things that we, in the real world, often take for granted. That's where we realise the difference between the non-human and human elements in the film - it's almost as if they've exchanged ideologies. The film will make you wonder at the end - what does humanity mean? And are all humans necessarily humane?\nThe end is the real clincher for me. In the original Blade Runner, the film ends with Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) standing in the rain, giving one of the most powerful soliloquies in the world (Tears in Rain). It's symbolic, because all he wanted was to live a human life, and because he's dying, those beautiful memories of his will be lost in the rain. The world is broken, and Deckard and Rachel are on the run from an uncertain future. In this film, Ryan Gosling is shown sleeping under snowfall - snowflakes are falling on his face, while Deckard goes to meet someone very special. The raindrops have solidified and become snowflakes - the world is (hopefully) a happier place, and Deckard finally gets to piece his broken past together. No more memories will be lost in the rain, now that the rain is solidified.\nI was in a daze the moment I stepped out of the theatre. I needed to sit down, pause and reflect on life. Blade Runner 2049 is a new-age sci-fi classic with traditional values that hits you hard the more you think about it. Villeneuve has given Ridley Scott a glorious tribute, and expanded a much-loved universe with more love. It's a film you have to see to believe.",

The colorful artificial lights contrasting with the grayness of the chaotic, decaying ecosystem gave me a sense of desolation and hopelessness making the very real human moments all the more powerful.

If I were to be nitpicky, the only slight flaw I found was one or two scenes that could have been shortened or entirely cut.\n\nIt may not do well in the box office like most art house movies, but like the original, it will be remembered as one of the sci-fi greats for many decades to come.",

Ryan Gosling dusts off that sleepy-eyed, low-octane acting style of earlier roles to great effect as K, a replicant blade runner tasked with unraveling a game-changing mystery that links him with his predecessor Rick Deckard (a feisty Harrison Ford, who's seemingly on a mission to revive all of his past movie characters...can 'Regarding Henry 2' be far behind?). For his part, director Denis Villeneuve ('Sicario', 'Arrival') faithfully evokes the original film's dystopian setting with stunning visuals and a thunderous, bone-chilling score that will transport you right back to those grimy Los Angeles streets of the future.\n\nThat being said, the very elements that made Scott's movie aesthetically ground-breaking have been duplicated so often over the thirty-five years that separate these two films that they can't help but feel a little underwhelming this time around. Worse, the movie's languid pacing will make you feel every one of its 163 minutes, which makes its thin plotting and underdeveloped themes all the more frustrating. [Some may argue that the original film shares this same lack of narrative depth, but at least it wrapped things up in under two hours.] Sure, the shadowy figures that populate BLADE RUNNER 2049 do a good deal of soul-searching, but to little avail. This long-awaited trip 'back to the future' is an interesting misfire, but a misfire all the same.",

That being said I found myself in the same situation with this remake adaption. The movie was slow, eerie, with paused-drawn out cut scenes that made the moving just boring. The cool CGI special effects was not enough to keep my interest. Thank god for my popcorn ??. What made it worse is the weird overly loud horn/siren soundtrack. Over kill. What may have been ground breaking of it\u0092s time in the 80\u0092s is not ground breaking for today. Worse 3 hours of my life wishing I could get back. I\u0092m giving this film a 2 out of 10.

Besides riping an AI romance plotline straight from Spike Jonze's \"Her\" that has little relevance to the main story, the rest of the film flounders in uncertainty and reluctance to explain elements while over explaining others. To say it's a slow burner is putting it mildly. 49, trying to match the noir aspects of the first film, forgets at times that atmosphere is essential to noir and not just slow pacing. (The drawn-out fight scene at the end to justify a climax, for example.) The sanitary brightly lit LAPD station also harms the noir aesthetic and other jumps in location expand the world but at a loss of overall plot structure and cohesive vision. At times it felt like I was watching parts of a TV series crammed together hoping it will all make a nearly 3-hour long movie. The performances were top notch, but the characters themselves and their needlessly dense dialogue were what bogged down what could have been good scenes. (Side note, Harrison Ford gave a better performance with half the effort of Jared Leto) But seriously tho, Jared Leto's monologs only confused the motivation of his character. (Maybe it takes so long to make replicants because you have to give a speech before killing them for no reason? IDK) The production design was pretty but one dimensional. what made the original so visually striking was the film grain and the miniatures and the set dressing, things lacking in this rebootquel.  In all, 2049 is a rather convoluted attempt to rebrand another 80s classic and I hope they don't make another one. I'll take a Neuromancer adaptation instead.",

For the past thirty years, the human race has been integrated with\u00a0bioengineered humans called \u0093replicants.\u0094 One of the newly formulated replicants is K (Ryan Gosling) a \u0093Blade Runner\u0094 for the LAPD. K\u0092s job is to track & \u0093retire\u0094 the problematic outdated replicants still at large. After being sent on a routine mission to retire Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista), an outdated replicant quietly living as a protein farmer, K discovers human remains inside a box buried beneath a long dead tree. When forensic examination reveals that the 30-year-old remains are from a female replicant, Rachael, who apparently died giving birth to a child from her union with human Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), the search begins for this evolutionary anomaly. LAPD is intent on finding & terminating the hybrid replicant while replicant manufacturer Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) sends his sadistic enforcer Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) to track down the human-replicant in order to further endow his future replicants. As K investigates the identity of Rachael & Deckard\u0092s child, he begins to question whether his memories are the just the usual implants or perhaps actually his real experiences. Blade Runner 2049 is directed by Denis Villeneuve from the screenplay by Michael Green & Hampton Fancher, wrote the screenplay for the first film. Blade Runner 2049 is a CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE; a mesmerizing immersion into an alternate reality that is exquisitely haunting & emotionally charged. This is a sci-fi film that has all the same captivating elements of the first film & so much more depth & impact. The visual effects were awe-inspiring & have you believing that this world could actual exist. The performances from the cast also feature Robin Wright as K\u0092s boss, Lieutenant Joshi, Carla Juri as Dr. Ana Stelline, & Ana de Armas as K\u0092s hologram companion Joi, were all excellent. Ryan Gosling gives one of the best performances of his career & should get some major Best Actor award consideration. I highly recommend watching the first film to fully understand the storyline & also to appreciate the technical elements used in the 80\u0092s compared to today\u0092s filming style. Blade Runner 2049 is a film that you\u0092ll want to see again. Blade Runner 2049 is a GIGANTIC MUST-SEE FILM OF THE YEAR which you can experience in 2D, 3D or IMAX 3D.\u00a0",

There is zero hand-holding and it deals with extremely profound philosophical topics and is told in a very arcane manner. You should not see this unless you watch the final cut first or I promise you will be confused.  A great cinematic achievement but an extremely difficult watch. If you thought Prometheus was slow and enigmatic, this makes Prometheus feel like Die Hard in comparison.  I think it's an instant classic, but perhaps for other reasons than the plot.

Also, Hans Zimmer went a little too \"bwah\" crazy in this, enough to fill five full Inception films. Please someone give this a guy a new sound effect!",

            "content": "To say I wouldn't have liked this if it were bad would be a lie. You can't really have a conversation about it without placing it in context of the preceding film from 1982 (or, really, 2007's The Final Cut) and Philip K. Dick's original book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? that will both forever serve as monoliths of science fiction. When trying to analyse it completely separate from the first film, 2049 just doesn't hold up, so it is much more a companion piece in terms of plot with a few updated themes. At the base of the film, the central performances are quite strong. You have a career best for Harrison Ford. Gosling brings more of his Drive strong, silent, and violent repose. The supporting roles from namely Sylvia Hoeks and Ana de Armas are fitting, and even Jared Leto manages to inject real some gravitas into his megalomaniac villain.\n\nVisually, there really isn't anything better out there. The production design is absolutely epic. Roger Deakins' signature cinematography effortlessly blends the ambition of 2001: A Space Odyssey with the vastness of the west he showcased in the Coens' No Country for Old Men and his previous outing with director Denis Villeneuve Sicario. For a sound meets visual experience, you could not ask for more, as even the occasionally farty, but very Hans Zimmer score mitigates the expectations set by Vangelis' original themes.\n\nMy initial reaction to the story was one of disappointment. While fulfilling the neo-noir genre with a somewhat convoluted crime mystery there are few thin points in the plot, but noir is about atmosphere, and this one has that in droves. What at first seemed like pointless CG eddies filled with adolescent techno-sex fantasies end up becoming footnotes on Gosling's inner struggle - rectifying his replicant nature with his desire to be or feel human. Throw in the fact that he is in love with a hologram woman projected by his phone, and you can fill in the gaps about what that suggests of modern living.\n\nAt two and a half hours, there are so many thematic elements embodied by the different characters that it would be a chore to list them all, but as with any Villeneuve film, that richness is understated and takes a back seat to the visuals and action. As to whether you will be satisfied with it leaving the theater, I think it will depend on how much import you place on the source material and what you have come to expect from the blockbuster experience. In the case of the former, I would say Blade Runner 2049 falls a bit short. In the latter, of course, it far surpasses anything in the past few years.",

He had feelings it seemed like he either denied himself, or the humans denied him of his humanity, despite replicants ability to feel happiness and sadness.  \n\nTo all those hating on Jared Leto, his character was incredibly creepy, but being that he portrayed a blind mad scientist, you really felt that he as man was out of touch with his humanity, as he saw the replicants as nothing more than just his play things.  \n\nThe whole movie truly made me feel pity and a sense of attachment to the characters, particularly the replicants who were doing nothing more than living their lives to the best of their ability, and just wanting to be treated like they are normal and real, just like us. \n\nSo, needless to say at this point, watch this movie.

The mystery is not complicated enough for its three hour runtime. It's like calling a knock knock joke labyrinthine because the one telling the joke keeps putting you on hold to answer the phone or cook dinner, and what should be a 30 second exchange takes hours. The Cinerama Dome screening had a special guest in Jared Leto thanking everyone for coming out and saying he plays a horrible man in this. He's great in his scenes, but only gets two. His henchwoman played by Slyvia Hoeks is one of the many terrible casting decisions in this film. Funny that Harrison Ford is walking around in a grey t-shirt when the producers received backlash over his look in the trailer they swore on a stack of digital bibles that it was teaser footage and not his actual look for the film. Just thought that was funny. Oh he puts a shirt on over it later, so there ya go. In the end there are way too many long drawn out scenes, and useless in depth ten minutes here and there of how some piece of technology works. I'm sure the hipsters will score this high to some how make up for the fact that they never saw the original in theaters on it's first run because they were not born or too little. Some nice actions scenes, Deckard's lair is very cool, some nice early moments with the hologram Joi .",

The film enjoys its own slowness a little too much, which can challenge audience's patience from time to time, but the story throws out bread crumbs to a really fascinating riddle often enough to keep you interested in the classic detective story, much like in the original. Especially the final act is really rewarding and worthy of the big shoes it has to fill. The camera work and the sound design are particularly breath-taking. A challenging and philosophical, beautiful and ugly, smarting and engaging Sci-Fi thriller that will stick to your mind for quite a while.",

It's subtly nods to the original, with discreet sound effects that make everything feel more organic. \n\nApart from the initial understanding given to us at the beginning, the following 2 hours will give you a gentle roller coaster ride of emotions, revelation and experiences. The pacing is excellent the emotion is real and action is tense. I found myself gripping my seat as often as I felt a lump in my throat. \nThe imagery is nothing short of masterful and the whole aesthetic of the film, though different is every scene helps us to see deeper into the Blade Runner universe, from the neon clad cities, to the vast scrapheaps, the sunset glow of an irradiated Las Vegas, the pristine architecture of Wallace's head quarters, and the final menace of the city's giant sea defences.  \n\nThe movie could be stand alone in itself, but to really experience it, you need to know the original. And, like the original, it leaves you wanting more. It doesn't so much as answer some of the original mysteries, more like giving you a different point of view on the same themes.\nDespite the low turnout at the cinema so far, there were only 20 people in my evening sitting, which I still do not understand, I can tell you that this is a movie worth watching. It left a profound effect on me which I still can't seem to comprehend, as if my life has changed...... oh, and the soundtrack, that beautiful soundtrack, as iconic as the originals.\n\nPlease see this movie, and bring your friends!",

            "content": "Deciding to film a sequel for \"Blade Runner\" is a lot like being Bob Dylan's son and deciding you're gonna follow in the old man's footsteps and become a musician: there's no way to live up to the impossible expectations created by the greatness of the original. \n\nAnd like the Wallflowers before them, Denis Villeneuve & Co have gamely made a solid effort, yet for all their determination wind up feeling like imitators rather than innovators. And not just imitators of the original film--that is to be expected. No, where the original film created a unique neo-noir dystopia that brought the idiosyncratic genius of Philip K. Dick to life, \"Blade Runner 2049\" feels more like an exercise in checking off by-now-common science fiction tropes, tropes that have been explored far more successfully by other recent films/TV (Ex Machina, Battlestar Galactica, Mad Max: Fury Road, etc).\n\nWhile not breaking new ground, the first 2/3 of \"2049\" was engaging and engrossing: the attention to detail in the world-building was superb, and the performances by Ryan Gosling, Robin Wright, & Co were solid, if not great. Things then, sadly, fall apart in the third act, where it seems to me that Villeneuve, Hampton Fancher & Co tacked on an ending from a different film: a generic, action-oriented denouement of schmaltz, parenthood, and \"revolution\". \n\nIt's as though they forgot what it was that made the original \"Blade Runner\" so successful in the first place: it's a noir procedural; the characters and their problems are small scale, and their actions don't really effect their world. Replicants escape from time to time, and they have to be hunted down; it's a job, it's housecleaning. That some of the replicants (like Roy Batty) are more human than their human creators is ultimately irrelevant to everyone except for Deckard, whose view only changes when confronted by Batty's act of mercy and his naked, frightened, human mortality at the very end.\n\nIn \"2049\", the procedural elements are compelling; but when those are jettisoned in the third act, the jarring shift in tone brings everything crashing down. Tired messianic themes and \"Terminator\" knock-offs replace the (mostly) quiet, confident storytelling of the first two acts. I say \"mostly\" quiet, because someone (Ridley Scott? Villeneuve?) had the bright idea of asking Hans Zimmer to compose the score for this thing, and that score pretty much veered between garish re-workings of the score from the original \"Terminator\" and cynical, strategic use of glosses of Vangelis' classic score from the original \"Blade Runner\". \n\nIn the final analysis, \"2049\" is a film of its time, for good and ill. It's okay. \"Blade Runner\", on the other hand, was a film so far ahead of its time and so perfectly wrought that it remains essentially timeless, holding up after countless repeat viewings. It's hard to imagine that many folks in the future will feel compelled to spend the nearly 3 hours required to revisit \"2049\".",

Dialogue was S-L-O-W  everyone walked S-L-O-W-L-Y (you've got a hover- park closer where you need to be!) and it was a pretty basic story with pretentions of being deep and thought provoking through silences and characters staring off into nothing.\n\nI didn't mind the electronic soundtrack as our cinema isn't massively loud but can imagine it would grate in a loud multiplex. The cinematography was pretty much state of the art as were the effects but they can't rescue a film that is so slow, long and tedious. Cut out an hour of wandering around and it was still an hour too long.\n\nThe acting is O.K. at most and the last 15 minutes are O.K. but not worth the wait. I'm sure a couple of other people in the audience were sleeping towards the end and a couple had left 3/4 of the way through. All in all easily the most disappointing film this year  with expectations sadly unfulfilled. IF we ever watch again on DVD it'll be worth trying x2 speed.",

            "content": "Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is quietly becoming one of the most interesting and exciting filmmakers in Hollywood today. Since 2015 he has released modern masterpieces Sicario and Arrival, with this sci-fi sequel adding another triumph to his recent success. Although linked to Ridley Scott's 1982 cult classic, this futuristic epic stands on its own two feet with a new story centred on LAPD agent K (Ryan Gosling), a Blade Runner (someone who hunts and 'retires' faulty androids) questioning his own existence. With unwavering support from girlfriend Joi (Ana de Armas), K continues to seek answers in places his superiors would prefer he didn't look, all paths leading to an infamous predecessor who has been missing for 30 years: Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford). Screenwriters Hampton Fancher and Michael Green have provided Villeneuve with an abundance of meaty, thought-provoking material to bring to life, real world parables thinly veiled inside an intelligent and mature narrative that even provides a few genuinely impressive twists. Cleverly inserted flashbacks and references provides enough context for those who aren't familiar with Scott's Blade Runner, but thankfully the audience is credited with enough smarts to join the dots without having their hands held. For a movie so focussed on the theme of identity, it's only fitting that Villeneuve-along with veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins-has crafted an exquisite visual identity that pays homage to the original whilst establishing it's own uniqueness. Every frame is meticulously dressed, the stunning production design merging seamlessly with the CGI to create a utopian world that feels entirely lived-in, whether it's the metallic, technology-centric inner-city or the dusty, wasting-away outer limits. The score by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer is also amazing, the deep base and subtle synth tunes seeping into each scene to enhance the ethereal atmosphere. Don't be scared off by the lengthy runtime, Villeneuve ties all of the elements together-including outstanding performances from Gosling, de Armas, Robin Wright and Jared Leto-to deliver an utterly engrossing sci-fi saga that warrants a big screen viewing. Blade Runner 2049 is that rare follow-up that not only matches what came before, but surpasses it.",

The only thing you need before seeing Blade Runner 2049 is a viewing of the original film from 1982 (probably the \"final cut\" version).?\n\n The movie begins with a screen shot of six sentences which will bring even a non-viewer of the original Blade Runner (1982) up to speed.  While not a prerequisite, knowledge of that original movie will enhance the viewer's enjoyment.\n\n The cinematography was beyond dreams. The plot was not overly complicated, but still enough to hold the viewer's attention. While a long movie (2 hours 43 minutes), the visuals, acting, world building are all enough to make that time seem short, not rushed or overly packed with details. The acting by all whether primary or secondary characters made these people far more real than one could hope in a science fiction movie.  There is one well-known actor, who is in only 2 short scenes at the beginning of this film. His performance was amazing with sensitivity and emotion. Reprising his role (Deckard) from the original movie, Harrison Ford's best scene was at the film's conclusion with only his face and the movement of one hand silently but instantly expressing Deckard's feelings. Ryan Gosling (as \"K\") was equally as good in this movie.\n\n Blade Runner 2049 is available in regular format, Real3D and IMAX.  I saw the movie in Real3D. Perhaps my theater had worn out equipment, but the 3D was not worth the extra dollars.  I do intend to see this movie again, but probably in regular format.",

            "content": "I can start by saying that I'm not a fan of the original.  While I can see why people like it and hold it in high regard, it was a mature science fiction movie that was a couple years before my movie going time and it never fully 'clicked' with me.  I've watched 1982's Blade Runner a few times in my adult years and, despite not being able to get all on board with it, I can still recognize it as a great sci-fi movie, just not one I am in to.  This isn't 1982 though, onto the review of Blade Runner 2049.\n\n     Say what you want, word it how you will... Blade Runner 2049 has a style all it's own and it owns it.  Cold, dark, grim, sharp, and heavy are all words that could describe Blade Runner 2049 and none of them are necessarily bad.  'Heavy' could be the most problematic description for a movie but this is a movie that knows it's density and doesn't bother asking the audience for help and it doesn't need to.  All the wonderful premises that science fiction presents for the future of science and technology should come with the warning that is Blade Runner 2049.  If someone goes into this movie sane then they will still probably be sane when they leave BUT it could get the crazy train going for some.  If someone is already crazy going in, they're screwed.  Regardless of one's sanity, if one really sinks their teeth into this movie then they really should doubt reality and even doubt who and what they are afterwards, because... how do you know for sure?\n\n     Crazy is good, and Blade Runner 2049 is crazier than the 'cold,' 'dark,' 'grim,' 'sharp,' and 'heavy' tags that can be applied to it to make the audience believe it's not crazy at all.  If I had to describe the type of ride it is, I would say it's like a roller coaster that is completely submerged underground.  A very dark ride that you don't know where it's headed from one turn to the next, but it never gets too high or has too steep of a drop off because of the limits it being underground presents.  I am not sure it's a 'top ten sci-fi movie of all-time' but it can make a good and strong case.\n\n9 of 10\n\nWINNER: MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF 2017\n",

            "content": "No, I don't hate it, but the movie left me very cold.\n\nTo start with the positives, I'll definitely award big points to the visuals. I may have spent half the movie looking at my watch, but what I saw up on the imax screen was impressive. It goes beyond good art direction and cinematography - all the world-building details were really interesting, so I have to applaud that. There are numerous tertiary characters sprinkled throughout the film that make the world fee truly alive. I, for one, would have loved to have spent more time with Barkhad Abdi's Dr. Badger or Lennie James' Mr. Cotton.\n\nAs for the primary cast, Sylvia Hoeks and Ana de Armas have the most interesting characters, and both display admirable screen presence that carries their scenes. Harrison Ford is only in it for the money, but does his grumpy old man schtick well enough. Robin Wright is decent as Gosling's superior, and even Dave Bautista does a good job with his small, but effective role.\n\nRyan Gosling, on the other hand... Well, he plays Ryan Gosling. He's in his default \"blank expression\" mode cultured from his time spent with Nicolas Winding Refn. For my money, Gosling is a wildly unconvincing actor. I never get the sense that he's actually the character I'm watching, only that he's Ryan Gosling playing make-believe for a paycheck. He only really shines when given good dialogue. The best Gosling performances I can remember were in Gangster Squad and The Nice Guys, because he was given things to say and do except stare off into space. He has a few good moments here, namely when playing off de Armas' character, and in a few plot-critical scenes I won't spoil, but 90% of the time you could replace him with a cardboard cutout and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. There exist great actors who can sit in relative silence for the majority of a film, but these kinds of performances work when you have an actor who communicates great volumes of information from even the slightest facial expressions. Gosling does not have an expressive enough mug to be doing this kind of non-acting so frequently.\n\nAnd then there's Jared Leto, who has made it his mission lately to give the AMPAS second thoughts about awarding him their coveted golden statuette. Whilst not giving us another Suicide Squad Joker-level performance, instead he gives us his \"Blind God\", a pretentious douchebag who rambles about ambition, slavery, divine creation, blah, blah, blah, none of it arriving within a mile of a salient point. Honestly, this character accomplishes nothing in the movie, and exists only to communicate one of the movie's most punishingly obvious themes. Listen, I don't know if you've ever heard this before - it's kind of a weird concept - but bear with me, ok?\n\nSlavery? It's bad.\n\nDid I just blow your fucking mind? No? Oh. Well, that takes the thunder out of the movie's message a little bit. BR2049 seems to be all about slavery and a coming slave revolt, except it presents it in such a ham-fisted way, it warrants more of an eye-roll than an attaboy. By the time Replicant Lives Matter showed up to recruit Gosling, the movie had bathed in graphic slave plantation imagery and splattered the cyberpunk n-word across the walls and tongues of future California. Yet despite the subtext, nothing actually comes of the (supposedly) escalating movement. This is not the only theme in the movie, but it's the one that's given the most attention. The story presents an idea that it claims will have catastrophic consequences (I'm trying to be vague to save you from spoilers), but it doesn't care about those consequences. It doesn't even explore the ideas from a philosophical perspective. Instead the shocking revelation that precipitates the central conflict is just a MacGuffin to keep the action moving along. When Denis Villeneuve's name pops up on the screen, and the auditorium lights have clicked back on, you're left with nothing.\n\nThat's my biggest problem with this movie - it's empty. It doesn't have a story, the characters don't have arcs - it's a bunch of things that happen, and then the movie ends. Yes, it's a detective story, and features the detective uncovering clues and following leads, but without a compelling character (or compelling screen presence to play the lead), everything in the movie just feels like a flat sequence of events that seem to be building up to something that never happens. This would be more excusable in a briskly-paced 90-minute movie, but not across 164 minutes.\n\nAlso, on a more minor note, whilst the visuals are great, the audio was a mixed bag. The music was sometimes effective, but too often fell into the trap of the \"loud bwaaaamm\" noisy synth stabs. The sound effects were also mixed very high, resulting in cacophonous explosions and gunfire, and fisticuffs that sounded like Harrison Ford was beating up Ryan Gosling with an obese salmon.\n\nThe original Blade Runner is not one of my favourite movies. That's not to say that it's bad. Just because I hate everything, doesn't mean I hate everything. It's a good movie, yet possessing such a venerated reputation, that I have watched it many times more than I watch most other films, in search of that elusive detail which will allow me to unlock its \"majesty\". I've not found it. That said, it does its job well enough, has beautiful cinematography and art design, memorable scenes, good dialogue, and a fantastic performance by Rutger Hauer. It's a good movie - 8 out of 10.\n\nI was very skeptical when a sequel to Blade Runner was first announced, but knowing that its creation was in the hands of Denis Villeneuve, who had impressed me repeatedly for the last seven years, I reserved a cautious optimism - hopeful that 2049 would be another shining entry in the man's esteemed catalogue. I prayed that it would turn out ok.\n\nIt did turn out ok, but nothing more than ok. This is easily Villeneuve's weakest film (though, admittedly, I haven't anything he made before 2010).\n\nBest I can muster for Blade Runner 2049 is a 5 out of 10. Perhaps that will change upon a second viewing, but I can't say whether I'd enjoy it more or less the next time I commit myself to its tediously long 164 minutes. We'll see.",

Bladerunner 2049 did not let me down. It was visually stunning, unique, intriguing, and the acting was completely phenomenal. It re-opens the world of the original bladerunner and it captures a similar essence while being an entirely different movie. Seeing a movie I love get further story expansion was exciting enough for me, this movie went above my expectations. It's not without its plot flaws, and it left me with feeling there were still loose ends and questions to be answered, but these were only minor issues for me and it didn't take away from how much I enjoyed this movie. I mostly see people whining about length, so i'll go ahead and say that some people can handle lengthy movies with dedication to details and emotional portrayal, while others cannot. If length and \"drawn out scenes\" is going to keep you from enjoying a movie then go watch a Michael Bay film, because this is probably not your style. As someone who loves experiencing movies, I didn't feel bored for one second of this film. Me and my boyfriend both agreed that never before had we been so enraptured in a movie we saw in theatres.

Like the original film, this movie is very slow.  Unlike the original film, however, this movie is also very long, making the slow, quiet pace seem REALLY slow and REALLY quiet.  Almost too slow, at times.  It's also chock full of extra stuff that, quite frankly, could've been left out to give it a more acceptable run-time.  Things like K's holographic girlfriend.  She's a good character and it makes for an interesting contrast since she (a virtual A.I.) actually comes off as more human than K (a replicant) does, but ultimately, she adds almost nothing to the story, and yet we spend a lot of time exploring their relationship.  And honestly, even Harrison Ford's character, Deckard, the same character from the first movie, is a bit pointless.  Like Han Solo, I got the feeling he was only there as fan-service and his presence dictates the time period (both this movie and STAR WARS THE FORCE AWAKENS had to take place 30 years later to account for Ford's age, where, otherwise, these sequels could have taken place at any point and both probably would have been better films for it).\n\nWhat 2049 really gets right is returning to the world of the first movie and even managing to expand on it quite a bit.  It's a rich, iconic world and it was fun to see it again after all this time (even if it was shockingly similar to the setting of the live action GHOST IN THE SHELL...  To the point where we can almost imagine that both movies take place in the same world).  Apparently, the future of advertising is 100-stories tall holographic women walking around between buildings like sexy, translucent kaiju.\n\nIf you're a fan of the original BLADE RUNNER you won't be disappointed in 2049.  It's worth seeing in theaters for the graphics alone.  It's a seriously visual movie that really deserves the theater experience.  It earns a \"Buy it on 3-D Blu-Ray\" on Talon's Movie Scale.",

With a few exceptions, most attempts have fallen flat on their face (Point Break? Fuller House anyone?). With unpolished cultural properties slowly running out, I suppose it was only a matter of time before Blade Runner was targeted for a reboot. When hardcore fans (myself included) first heard about this, there were more gulps than cheers. After all, Blade Runner's stature is unique. It landed with a thud back in 1982, but it's legacy has swelled like a balloon ever since. After being re-cut twice (the 2007 final cut is my personal fav) only now is it regarded as the masterpiece it always deserved to be. And let's face it, it never cried out for a sequel (neither version, that is). Alas, here we are with Blade Runner 2049 helmed by French-Canadian director Denis Villenueve (Arrival, Sicario, Prisoners) and produced by original director Ridley Scott. So...how'd they do?\n\nWell, first off, this flick is PACKED with spoilers. That being said, you're only getting an opinion here. Blade Runner 2049 steps out of the shadow of it's predecessor and emerges a towering colossus. It's one of the best sequels ever made and one of the best science fiction movies I've ever seen in my life. Yep, we're in that rare company of sequels here that equals, if not exceeds the first. Ryan Gosling is wonderful in the lead, Harrison Ford hasn't been THIS good since The Fugitive and both newcomers Ana de Armas and Sylvia Hoeks are stars in the making (de Armas, especially, is heartbreaking). Jared Leto is predictably obnoxious, which might actually be a brilliant sleight-of-hand casting trick here since he's the villain. Within the first 15 minutes alone, it's plain to see why Ridley Scott hand-picked Villenueve to helm this incredible film. It's easily the most vital sci-fi movie released by the majors since District 9. Blade Runner fans won't believe their eyes and ears when the house lights go up...if they aren't busy DRYING their eyes, that is. It's stunning. Simply stunning.",

            "content": "It made no sense to bring Harrison Ford back. His story arc at the end of the first movie was complete. Shoehorning him and Sean Young into the movie was forced and desperate. Rick Deckard is not an integral part of the Blade Runner universe. Just because a character is important to us does not make him the center of the Blade Runner world. Also, Blade Runner is not about freedom, it's about what it means to be human. This pale sequel attempts to answer the question of what makes one human by saying that dying for a cause makes someone human. Ignoring how that makes no sense, that goes against the themes of the original. The original was also clever and ambiguous about whether or not replicants were people or just machines and whether or not Blade Runners were murderers or just retiring unneeded technology. This movie lacks the subtlety and grace of the original by insulting its audience by saying \"Fuck it, replicants are an unobvious metaphor for an oppressed minority and Blade Runners are fugitive slavers. Can't let the audience be confused.\" Another problem with bringing Deckard back is that he doesn't have much of an identity outside of Ford's acting persona (playing tough but vulnerable men). Obviously Ford's approach to that has changed in 40 years so when he plays Deckard again, he doesn't seem like Deckard, he just seems like old Harrison Ford. It's not like when he returned to the role of Indiana Jones or Han Solo where, like those movies or not, he actually did feel like an older version of those characters. Why? Because those characters were better established than Deckard, who was clearly not intended to be the protagonist of an entire franchise, let alone meant to return 40 years later for an unnecessary sequel. Ford aside, the acting was terrible. Gosling was wooden, Jared Leto was just embarrassingly bad, Robin Wright was clearly just there for the paycheck, etc. All the characters were also incredibly bland. Most disappointing of all was Luv, a very, very poor replacement for Roy Batty who had no personality outside of being the tough \"bad girl\". Having pretty lights does not automatically make a movie good. Looking \"purty\" does not make up for a terrible script and terrible acting. I haven't seen any of Villenue's other work and after this I am in no hurry. The emperor has no clothes.",

Sean Young and Rutger Hauer have previously commented negatively towards the idea of the sequel with Young actually suggesting a boycott should she not be involved and Hauer, sharing my sentiments, could not understand the reasons of creating a sequel of something that he already considers cinematic perfection. \n\nMy reservations eventually turned into expectations being fully aware of having some of the most amazingly talented people in the business being on board in the production. Villeneuve's regular, amazing cinematographer, Roger Deakins is here, Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch on the score and Blade Runner's screenwriter Hampton Fancher returns to write the story and screenplay. But it is really just Hollywood attaching key names to ensure the ticket sales? \n\nScott's Blade Runner was such a masterpiece in every sense giving rise to neo-noir science-fiction which had an outstanding score, a simplistic yet provoking story, the alluring performances with an enchanting production of artistic perfection that made a futuristic world look seemingly dated. It's all of these key elements that I had reservations about, wondering how Villeneuve and Co. would attempt to continue the story 35 years on. \n\nIt's set 30 years on from Blade Runner's 2019 and whilst we see a much larger world here, it's still very much a world that remains stagnant with the only key advancement we see are those of the latest replicants, the model Nexus-8s. \"K\", our new Blade Runner is on the prowl, but while retiring a formidable \"skinjob\" he discovers an incredible revelation that could change the world and rouses his imagination and questions his loyalties. \n\nThe story is smart enough to engage most, but it does seem to slip towards to end, like it struggles to reach an inevitable conclusion. You think it's becoming predictable but there's enough twists and subplot interventions to keep the intrigue going, even with the drawn out runtime that doesn't aid in creating anticipation leaving audiences hanging for longer than necessary. \n\nI was initially excited by the 163minute running time, but now having seen it, It's too long where it probably didn't need to be, where the pacing is incredibly slow and almost every scene is drawn out with long pauses of silence to parade Villeneuve's obvious, artful flair. It's a Villeneuve's film alright, set in a Blade Runner world but they should have heeded Dr. Eldon Tyrell's statement about the candle burning twice as bright and made this half as long. Well, not half as long but you get the metaphor. \n\nThe part was written with Gosling in mind and he suited the role of \"K\" with his usual stone-faced and often emotionless persona. I could see pass the Gosling I knew, empathising with his character. It was Deckard I had trouble with. All I could see was Harrison Ford and even with him standing there, I could almost forget the Deckard I was familiar with. Let's not forget, Deckard is only here not because he \"was good\" at what he did, because, in truth he wasn't anything but lucky; he's here by the grace of Roy Barry's sudden change of heart and mercifully letting him live. I can't be precise, but there's something different, and yes I get the character, as well as the actor has aged, but there's a part of me that thinks Harrison had forgotten how to play Deckard. \n\nI'm not entirely sure of the purpose of the character Joi, who's name might be a direct reference to the pornographic world, other than to increase some emotion investment for \"K\". Ana de Armas is stunning and adorable at the same time, but I think you could cut her entirely from the story and it wouldn't make that much of a difference. The character I really enjoyed beside Gosling's \"K\" was Sylvia Hoeks' Luv. A ruthless femme fatale who is more than just an assistant to replicant godlike creator, Niander Warren who's played poetically by Jared Leto. I feel there's a lot more to both their stories than what the film and the shorts let on. \n\nWhilst it does answer a lot of unanswered questions of the first film, mainly, is Deckard a replicant? It does provoke it's own set of questions flipping the quandary back and forth, affording replicants the freedom of imagination often being a sad reality and actually represents humanity's own desire to feel special, wanting to be the chosen one. There's a pang of betrayal but with no-one to truly blame, and there's a personal realisation of just how insignificant we can be in the grand scheme of things. And like the first film, it ends on an opportunity, leaving the door open for possibly more. Where does mankind go after this? What happens next? Which side will you be on? \n\nThe production as a whole is very impressive keeping much to the fashion of Blade Runner. The verbally-controlled analytical equipment, the costumes, the constant downpour, the oversized decanters and a possibly synthetic pet which might be a nod to Philip K. Dick's original story of Deckard wanting a real pet to elevate his status. Other little touches was the etched symbolic date that echoes the US general release and the neon multimedia advertising with some obvious major corporations waving their Illuminated banners. Did anyone else frown at the possible patriotic product placement? Peugeot? Really? \n\nThe marketing and promotion has been the best I've seen this year, with 3 shorts being released periodically prior to the main film coming out. It has to be mentioned here, Luke Scott, son of Ridley Scott directed two segments, \"Nexus Dawn\" 2036 and \"Nowhere to Run\" 2048 with Cowboy Bebop creator Shinichir\u00f4 Watanabe creating an anime short Blade Runner 2022 \"Black Out\". All being very impressive and intriguing. However, I was quite surprised there was no additional screening of Scott's original masterpiece, like what Scott did with Alien: Covenant showing Alien and Prometheus just prior to Covenant's release. But, I think I now understand why. It might be because of the contrast of style, character and tone would be more noticeable? \n\nBenjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer composed the score and sadly I think they have missed a trick here. However it does suit and makes this very much a Villeneuve film but personally, I wanted to see and hear a Blade Runner film and was hoping for the same ingenuity Vangelis created for the first. Listening to the score in isolation, I can't deny it's superb quality, but it's a score for an entire film, unlike Vangelis' individuality of an unique score. This isn't unique and much like the film, it's an inspired piece with parts borrowed from Vangelis'; some more obvious than others, with one key scene that almost attempts to rob off the original but I understand it to be a cue for the fans. Some parts have even been recycled from Dunkirk, just minus the tick-tocking. I also found the use of tracks from Elvis and Sinatra off-putting and unnecessary. There must have been a conscious choice and reasoning over the decided tracks and I'm thinking there was an opportunity to use something from today's musical arena, being from their past but making the film more relatable. \n\nIn comparison, this one lacks character, has a disparity from the previous and doesn't have the same magic of making a futuristic world seem old, distancing itself from Blade Runner's dismal Los Angeles. But don't get me wrong, the direction is nothing short of spectacular, the tonal style of this film differs greatly from Blade Runner allowing more colour to seep in and this isn't a criticism. The balance has been tilted offering predominantly daytime scenes as oppose to the dark, wet nights of Blade Runner; and the deployment of light, shadow and a full spectrum of colour is used so incredibly well, creating a vast range of artistic scenes and sequences. \n\nFor me, sequel versus previous; this is a perfect example of the previous being the trend-setter, the original that made neo-noir a genre, the one that inspires and continues to do so, where as this, the sequel is clearly the inspired, setting no aspirations or bringing anything original. To quote Salvador Dal\u00ed \"A true artist is not one who is inspired, but one who inspires others.\" Which ultimately results in this being a stunning Villeneuve imagining of an already established fantasy. \n\nRunning Time: 6\nThe Cast: 9\nPerformance: 8\nDirection: 10\nStory: 9\nScript: 9\nCreativity: 10\nSoundtrack: 8\nJob Description: 8\nThe Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the incredible and stunning cinematography. \n\n87% 9/10\n\nwww.spoileralertreviews.co.uk",

What else needed to be said about this universe? Apparently a lot.\n\nAs the title suggests, 2049 takes place 30 years after the original film. After the 'retiring' of a replicant, a newer Blade Runner played Ryan Gosling discovers a clue to a larger mystery. I won?t spoil anything beyond that, other than the film takes you down a multi layered path to solve said mystery.\n\nDirector Denis Villeneuve masterfully recreates the atmosphere of the original film while beautifully expanding upon it. Much like Ridley Scott's film, Villeneuve lets each scene breathe. It never feels like you're being rushed. To some this was a negative aspect of Blade Runner. I've heard countless people refer to the film as boring and taking too much time to get to the point. To me, it was magnificent. I loved that I was able to drink in every detail of the film without being rushed to a pointless action scene. The sequel is no different. The difference between the two films is that 2049 tells a much broader story. While the original film was cut and dry future noir, the  sequel is much more complex mystery. Again, I don?t want to spoil anything. Just know that you?re not getting a carbon copy of Blade Runner with prettier special effects. 2049 has a unique story to tell that doesn?t require you to be a fan of the original.",

Speaking of Rick Deckard himself, even if the character isn't in the film for as much as the marketing is leading you to believe, Harrison Ford, once again steals the show with his talent of bringing new dimensions to his most famous characters being on full display here. However the best performance comes from newcomer Ana de Armas as K's sweet hologram wife Joi. Once again in keeping with the themes of artificial intelligence wanting to be human, her sweet nature and her devotion to K humanises the bleak tone of this film, much like how Sean Young's Rachael brought humanity to the Replicant race in the first film.\n\nOverall, despite having a few problems in it's script such as Jered Leto's underdeveloped antagonist, Denis Villeneuve has managed to craft a worthy companion piece to the 1982 classic. As mentioned before, it's debatable which one is better in the overall long-run, but Blade Runner 2049 will serve as proof  that the legacy of the original film is in better hands than ever before.",

The movie does have an end that is a conclusion.   \nRyan impressed me with his demeanor in this film as well as all the cast that played their role very well.

So, if you expect to find the action of Mad Max, you'll actually find something more like Melancholy Max, or even Sad Max.  Heck, it's not even Irritated Max.  Actually, the film should be called Office Max.  Absent the artsy-ness and a couple odd fight scenes wherein a replicant female kept kicking the star in the face, it's actually less thrilling than a visit to Office Max.  I fell asleep twice.

It was a very serious movie with almost no humour to offer occasional relief.\nThe bad bits: Hollywood, MORE IS NOT BETTER. A running time of over two hours and forty minutes is just too long. If you can't tell your story in 100 minutes, you need to tighten it up. The \"atmosphere\" scenes without dialogue were interminable and most could have been cut with little loss. Most of the fight scenes could have been cut or shortened.\nThe movie was very violent. I realize the original was too, but somehow the violence in Blade Runner 2049 disturbed me more. It was way more graphic. Also, after a while, it got ridiculous: The main character was wounded in ways that would kill a normal person seven times over, yet he just kept bouncing back. The same goes for the Bad Guy (or Bad Gal in this case.)\nWhat truly irritated me about this movie, though, was the depiction of women. None of the characters was very well developed, but the female ones in particular were one-dimensional. They weren't even real people; they were tropes. You had the \"ruthless evil bitch\", the \"angelic mother who sacrificed all\" and of course tons of women as disposable sex toys. There was one scene in particular that I found very disturbing. The main character K has a fantasy hologram girlfriend. She (?) somehow invites a prostitute up to the apartment and sort of overlays her body so K can have sex with a real woman while it looks like he's having sex with his hologram. I found the idea of negating a real woman and turning her into some sort of fantasy very creepy.\nThere's also lots of gratuitous female nudity that has nothing to do with the story, but is just thrown in there. Some would argue that it helps set the atmosphere, but I think it was just to titillate. There's a small bit of male nudity, but it's presented clinically as replicants under construction and not erotically.\nGiven that Denis Villeneuve directed the excellent and sensitive movie \"Arrival\", I was all the more disappointed by Blade Runner 2049.\nMy overall score: 2.5 stars out of 5.",

Something that is at times, missing from BR2049.\n\nIn Blade Runner 2049, We're left with a visually stunning film with a great story line, and even some clever pre-movie vignettes, yet lost was the continuation of using music and sound design in almost every scene along with compelling characters set in the world we know as Los Angeles.\n\nIn the original Blade Runner, many scenes and characters had their own themes... just watch the original Blade Runner and you'll see and hear that. There are also a LOT of soundtracks for Blade Runner out there! Well, I left BR2049 feeling uninterested in obtaining it's soundtrack and that's saying a lot. All I heard was a rehash of the main theme in various forms: Long drawn out power chords, Inception type \"BLAAAATTTTS\" and an almost shameful reuse of music from the first film, almost needle dropped in here and there. It felt like the film didn't really know how to properly create an homage to Vangelis's score and what was done, as powerful as it was at times, simply sounded disconnected and rushed in places. No one really had a theme. No music stood out as original. Sad Face but true.\n\nThere were also quite a few questions raised but left unanswered. When I found our Jared Leto's character was blind only because Jared thought it would be 'cool', I felt this sort of explained why the film had so many character developmental holes in it. There simply was no true attention to character detail as there was in the first film. The first film had perfect pacing, busy streets, everything made sense. This film felt stark and narrow minded in it's specific, albeit riveting plot. There were also some continuity issues in that Los Angeles is apparently still the Atari driven, holographic mega-opolis, yet we hardly get to really see any of it! It's like The Omega Man except for what, one or two scenes with what felt like 1/4 of the extras the original film had and in scenes that felt shot in a day or two. I suspect this had to do with shooting in Hungary and not having access to utilizing potential shooting locations or extras... perhaps too expensive this day and age to pull off? It just felt like I remember more CG and less 'set design'. Missing was the iconic Dragon Neon too or at least I didn't see it.\n\nIn the end, the story was brilliant. I just felt it lacked understanding of the first film's vibe and lore. It also felt like there was no pre-screening and discussion of before it's release, leaving it feeling neutered... \n\nOne thing that bothered me was K's final scene. Again, we're treated to Tears in Rain which was fine, but once again it seemed like if you're going to do that, then where was K's tears? If you watched the film, you no doubt caught on to something about the Nexus8 series and their 'tears'... K should of shed a tear in the snow which should of froze on his face among the other falling snow flakes! Why did this not happen? It almost felt like someone forgot to add this in post as THAT would of been the #2 riveting reveal which would of been a double whammy on it's own plot 'twist' revealed earlier. It also would of setup much more fodder in pushing for a #3. Maybe that was the point. K didn't cry - yet because the film lacked so many answers, we're left not caring why or understanding why, plus why the mixed message with using Tears in Rain then? The film never got deep enough to really explain this in the first place.",

The world he takes us to, just is amazing.  Here's really why I liked this thing, and the timing of the release of the film certainly plays a factor.  When we are going through a time where the value of life is down, this movie says just the opposite.  The original said life is precious and I want more of it.

Why is it always raining? Why do Ford & Leto only have a total of about four scenes between them? Why does it go for over 2 & a half hours?\n\nThere is some plot, with K (Gosling) being a replicant Blade Runner, tasked by Joshi (Wright) to track down runaway replicants, which leads to uncovering a mystery surrounding Deckard & Rachael. It takes 100min for Ford to even appear. In the meantime, Hans Zimmer tries to recreate the original's iconic score, but not as synth-y and sometimes a bit too overwrought. There's a lot of K interacting with Joi (de Armas), his 'Her'-like holographic maid. Most of this is handled quite well, with the CGI of Joi interacting with the light and her surroundings done excellently. But, it doesn't help move the film along at all.\n\nThere is occasional bits of action/violence, mostly thanks to Luv (Hoeks), but not enough to sustain the first two hours, with the clues slowly unravelling and not much excitement. It does pick up in the final 45min and has a passable ending, but mostly I'm left with the feeling of \"it looks cool, but why do I care?\" Good to see heaps more of the flying cars, and like 'Star Wars', everything looks realistic and \"lived-in\", but most of the concepts have now been explored better by 'Terminator' and 'Mad Max'.",

I completely understand the philosophical debate purposed, but if people are being honest, the story line was basic and DID NOT require 2 hours & 44 minutes to tell it.  Additionally, Ryan's \"Joe\" was a well developed character; however, the protagonist (Jared Leto) was simply silly.  The original Blade Runner had a voiceover that was removed in the Director's Cut; however, this movie could've used that voiceover by Ryan.  It might've kept me from dozing off...",

And the more that time passes by and the more the story of Blade Runner 2049 sinks in the more the gravity of the story hits me... First of all it really was not what I was expecting... I had watched many trailers and interviews and I feel like I had done quite a successful job in staying away from spoilers.... \n\nAnd....\n\nWithout spoiling it for anyone else and giving too much away.... Whatever you think you know about the film... well, forget it.... You're way off the mark... \n\nThe best advice I can give though is however dark you think Blade Runner 2049 is.... It's darker than that.... It's much darker than the original... And the original was quite dark.... The cinematography is beautiful... it really is stunning... but the film itself.... did I mention it was dark??.. I think this is amplified (excuse the pun) by the movie's soundtrack... The work of Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch was for me...  at times.... malevolent... And perhaps if the music wasn't so dark and hostile the movie itself wouldn't come across like that also... But then what do I know?... That's not to say the music is bad... It was for me.... like I said malevolent.... As for the movie itself... Again without giving too much away.... It is a story of desperate hope and anguish... Wanting for a better life.... Replicants being more human than humans, but not being human and wanting nothing more than to be human... Are you keeping up??... And this whole time living in a dystopian world.... where the future of the human race is a lost cause and Mother Earth has never looked so heartbroken.... \n\nBlade Runner 2049 did have some nice surprises... which again... I won't spoil... Ryan Gosling is excellent... It is Harrison Ford's best work for years....  This overall review may sound like I'm being negative about Blade Runner 2049... But I'm not... I'm really not... I think Ryan Gosling said it best in an interview\n\nThe film is incredible... it's.... haunting...\n\nSo much so that I want to see it again and I will go and see it again",

The two are likely going to rival Last Jedi and have no other competition. Oscar wins in these two categories is not unlikely. Thoroughly mature and so far above what is to be expected form a blockbuster.\n\nThere are several moments that could have been handled with more grace and emotional realism.\n\nGosling and Ford had proper distance in their performance, keeping with the themes of the film.

Officer K stumbles upon a mystery of the past, something that could change the relationship or humans and replicants, and embarks on a journey of world-changing discovery, leading to his run-in with Deckard. Jared Leto masterfully plays Niander Wallace, a visionary and genius, who has taken over the defunct Tyrell Corp, creators of the original replicants who are hunted down by the blade runners. The blade runners were told to have been shut down for years, with this dystopian world having gone through a worldwide blackout, damaging many memory drives of the past, and an incredible famine.\u00a0 Wallace finds ways to stop the blackout and famine, leading him and his ego to the top. This allows him to take over for Tyrell Corp, which had gone defunct, and build his new obeying replicants, whom he calls \"angels.\" Ana de Armas, as Joi, an AI holographic girlfriend of Officer K, and Sylvia Hoeks as Luv, Wallace right-hand and also a replicant, add to the powerful characters of this film.\n\nYet, what makes this film on par with what the original brought to the table, is the entire cinematic experience we are given. Roger Deakins puts together one of the most visually stunning films I have seen in a long time. The visuals of this dystopian future are as spot on as I could imagine, color in the right places and not in others. The memory-making scene is a simple yet visually dramatic production and the radioactive wasteland is perfectly captured. I can't say enough of how visually stunning of a film it is. This is all enhanced by the dramatic score created by Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer. I don't know exactly how to describe it, but the sensations created by notes magnifies the experience in a thrilling way that perfectly hits. It is spot on in how it plays back to the original.\u00a0\nI can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this film. It hits all the points you are looking for, acting, sound, visuals, and story, and further enhances the original film. What a shockingly great surprise this was.

The entire cast is terrific, and director Denis Villeneuve fills Ridley Scott's shoes almost perfectly. If the great cinematographer Roger Deakin doesn't FINALLY win an Oscar for his work in this movie, it will be a crime.\n\nThe original Blade Runner is my all-time favorite film, and this sequel does more than just deliver. While the original is still the best, 2049 certainly gives it a run for its money. A must-see for any hardcore movie-lover or sci-fi fan!",

I can marvel at how intricate the design choices are that went into making it. I can admire it as something beautiful, grand and impressive, and there's a joy in exploring its intricacies and making surprising discoveries.\n\nBut a building, no matter how finely-made, can make me cry. Or laugh. Or scream, or gasp, or feel anything other than completely dispassionate and impersonal admiration for its construction.\n\nThe movie spends time being subtle and mysterious (a *lot* of time, considering it's nearly 3 hours long), but it doesn't bother providing genuine emotional connections between characters or to its audience, and seems to have no interest in doing so. It literally goes out of its way to damper the prospect of emotional connection of its central romance, then expects the audience to care about that romance's success or dissolution.\n\nBeing as vague as I can about the story (I learned it from watching you, Blade Runner 2049), the entire plot hinges on a broad statement that a character makes suggesting how dire the stakes are, but the movie does nothing to show that this statement is true. The film's bad guy pursues a course of action that, so far as I can tell, would put him out of business if successful, and is thus motivation-less. In the resolution of a mystery, we discover that a character chose an action that would provide an effective red herring, rather than him taking the rather obvious action that would be simpler and more effectively cover the mystery he's trying to hide.\n\nIt's a showcase for some magnificent cinematography. The performances are top-notch. The score is hypnotic. I've been thinking about the movie for a week, and I may even watch it again at some point, because it is that dense, and worthy of analysis.\n\nBut at no point did I feel emotionally connected.

            "content": "Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to the 1982 film, Blade Runner. It stars Ryan Gosling as Blade Runner agent K; as well as Harrison Ford, who reprises his role as Rick Deckard. \n\nTo start off, I found the first Blade Runner to be an incredibly interesting exploration of an Earth far in advance in technology but, chronologically speaking, more or less set a few years from now. The film is slick and oozes an awesome, seductive, vision of the future that draws audiences in. The cyber-punk music and neo-noir style is something to admire. But, while its aesthetics are alluring in nature, the story of Blade Runner showcases a very downtrodden Los Angeles - the glamour and fame of A-list celebrities is clearly vacant, the fake facade of the American smile is washed away to reveal a depressing atmosphere, dripping with the threat of a gang, or, perhaps more of a worry, a replicant. A replicant is a biorobotic android who looks exactly like a normal human, with only a few signs of difference. \n\nTo cut a fantastic story short, Deckard (Ford) is tasked with hunting down the remnants of a rebellious replicant crew, all due to be 'retired' (assassinated). However, he falls in love with a replicant, which is crucial to the main point of the film. What is humanity? What are the parameters that determine human from everything else? An idea further explored in Blade Runner 2049.\n\nTHE TECHNICAL ELEMENTS:\nIf I was asked to come up with one element of Blade Runner 2049 that really stuck out to me, I would mention the music. Music can create and define the personality of a film, it can shape and change the way we, as an audience, experience a certain scene. The long synthetic drones throughout the film are incredibly spine-tingling. It is important to note that the original Blade Runner also featured the same style of music. This was important to me, this was important to the success of this film. The music is used expertly, it adds a certain gravitas to the climax. However, most importantly for me, is its presence throughout the quiet moments of the film. The music can be harsh and sharp, but in the film's downtime, the quiet synth hum offers a calming sensation. \n\nThe scenery, location, set-design is fantastic. From the large Egyptian-inspired Corporate pyramids to the crowded and compact city, Blade Runner's world tells a story through its aesthetics. There is a juxtaposition between the incredibly wealthy and the incredibly poor; there is seemingly more life, but more importantly, humanity, in the bereft in comparison to the wealthy, almost alien corporate beings. \n\nBoth films seem to have a strange fetish for rain, it is almost a trademark element of the Blade Runner series. Personally, I believe that the rain is not only to set the tone of a neo-noir, but it is to also convey the idea that, like the sheer number of people living in the city dwellings add a certain pressure to oneself. And, like rain which dampens and soils your clothing until every fibre of your body is soaking and you feel oddly violated, the idea of a 'personal bubble' does not exist. In this, we empathise with these characters, we see people trying to come to terms with a harsh world in which all are mere lambs in comparison to the potential grasp of power that the corporations have. \n\nThe film's excellence is not only contained within the confines of its cinematography; the acting within Blade Runner 2049 is flawless. Ryan Gosling was a perfect choice to play an initially emotionally-vacant officer to a battered and bruised sobbing mess by the end. The range on Gosling is astounding and when he felt pain, I did too. Harrison Ford returns as Deckard and he really impressed me and showed that he still had the ability to conjure up the emotional wherewithal to empathise and understand the emotional trauma that he has had to endure over the period of 30 years (the first film being set in 2019). There is one point in the film when K (Gosling) discovers a key clue to the finding of the child which is greatly executed through Gosling's warped teary-eyed face and the loud drone of the synthetic music, during this scene is when I decided that this would be one of my favourite films, the climax of the film decided for me that Blade Runner 2049 should be my tip-top favourite film of all time.   \n\nTHE STORY SUMMARISED *SPOILERS*:\nBlade Runner 2049 follows LAPD Blade Runner K (Gosling), a replicant tasked with taking out older 'rogue' replicants. After retiring one replicant, K comes across an interesting find, which leads him on a mission to find the child of Rick Deckard and Rachel (the replicant Deckard fell in love with from the first film). \n\nMeanwhile, the disturbing Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) sends his enforcer Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) to tail K, with the aim of capturing the miracle child. Wallace being the head of an organisation that mirrors the Tyrell Corporation of the first film. Wallace has a God complex and believes that his replicants are angels that he wishes to force onto the world in their millions. \n\nThe film's climax ends with an incredible fight between K and Luv. Watching the fight I found myself slowly leaning forward, becoming more and more entranced by the magnificence on the screen. The fight ends with K killing Luv and sending Deckard to his child. Having been mortally wounded in battle, K lays back, looks at the sky, and dies, knowing that his purpose is done. Deckard meets his child and the credits roll\n\nCONCLUSION:\nMy summary of the plot does the film no justice at all and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in seeing the film. To me, this film is my favourite; something about it cut deep into me and touched my very soul. Thank you, Denis Villeneuve, thank you Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, and, perhaps most importantly of all, thank you, Ridley Scott.",

But in my opinion this film is even better than the original. Really is truly a great sequel. The visuals are outstanding and if roger deakins doesn't win an oscar then it is a crime. It is just  a beautiful film to look at. The music is superb and really adds to every scene it is in. The acting overall is great, Ryan gosling as usual is excellent and although Harrison ford has a smaller role he is still on form. The story is great and does a good job of remembering the original and respecting it. And then coming up with a good story which holds your attention from start to finish. And really feels like a natural continuation from the first film. One of the best films of 2017 and one of the best sequels in a long time. Denis villeneuve really does a brilliant job and cements his reputaion as one of the best directors working at the moment. Go see this on the big screen. That's where it deserves to be seen.

The score is ok but it doesn't feel as iconic as the original.  The acting is good and  Denis Villeneuve directing is excellent as usual.  \n\nIf you didn't have a problem with the pacing of the original, then you probably won't with this, though personally I do think the original is very slow and this film doesn't feel any different.  The story is interesting but I won't say anything about it cause I don't want to spoil it for anyone.  This film isn't an action film, more an art house film with action in it. \n\nSeeing the original isn't essential but probably worth doing and I would definitely say watch the 3 short films 2022, 2036, 2048.\n\nFor me this isn't the perfect film I was hoping for and think that trimming half an hour away from the film would help.  At times it does leave certain motivations unanswered and occasionally occasionally I feel the film tries to hard visually.\n\nThe film at its best is impressive but I would probably prefer to re-watch it on Blu-ray, where I can stop and come back to it another time (very similar to the original).",

            "content": "It is official, Blade Runner 2049 is an astounding triumph on multiple levels, it succeeds in crafting a sequel that builds upon its predecessor's story, and also stands on its own as a phenomenal modern sci-fi masterpiece. One of the greatest modern directors in Denis Villeneuve has created an immaculate film with a story that will render you speechless, characters that command your full attention, and filmmaking achievements that will go down in history. The main plot itself is a major spoiler which means you get a very vague synopsis that doesn't tell you much more than what the trailer does. The film follows K (Ryan Gosling), a blade runner who goes on a mission to unearth a secret that could change the world. As per usual, Roger Deakins' has teamed up with Villeneuve as the cinematographer and his work here is mesmerising, he captures this world in its best and worst light and either way it is beautiful. The score helmed by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch is electrifying and single handedly transports you into this world, as if you are living these events yourself. \n\nIt is written by Michael Green and co-writer of the original Blade Runner Hampton Fancher and what they manage to create with the story here is more than I could have ever expected. It amazingly continues the story of this world and its inhabitants and acknowledges the fact that a lot has changed since we last saw it, as the original film is set 30 years prior to these events. But at the same time it is a story that newcomers to the universe can easily get sucked into with the induction of characters such as K and Jared Leto's Niander Wallace. And what is fantastic about this is that it doesn't just continue the story for the sake of knowing \"what happens next\" it goes in certain directions to add to the events of the original in the same way the original story adds to these new events. It doesn't forget the events of the past, it acknowledges them and respects them. I cannot possibly go into the details or even the vague direction of the story due to it being shrouded in heavy spoilers but it goes in directions you don't expect and holds many surprises around every corner. I would say it is a very character centric story where the events that occur and every scene that you follow is crucial to understanding a character and developing their narrative arc. \n\nRidley Scott's Blade Runner is a film that to this day is visually incredible with cinematography that has stood the test of time and represents this futuristic world in the most beautiful way possible. Now you bring in one of the greatest cinematographers to ever exist in Roger Deakins and what he achieves here is undeniably stunning and easily some of his best work. The way this world is represented through darkness and colour creates an atmosphere and a feel for this world that is familiar yet foreign, and futuristic yet very lived in. Every shot had me in awe of everything I was seeing, every cityscape and every baron wasteland no matter how busy or empty had a story to tell and I was drawn in to this world like no other. Meanwhile, Zimmer and Wallfisch's score is the perfect acquaintance to this stunning cinematography with every piece of wall pounding sci-fi magic transporting you into this world and completely clearing your mind of the real one. I constantly found myself lost in this amazing score that compliments the visuals incredibly and it is most definitely one of my all time favourites. \n\nAs far as the performances go, everyone involved brings their A-game, especially Ryan Gosling who commands the screen for the majority of the runtime and straight up never breaks character for a second. Not that this film needs carrying but Ryan owns every scene he is in and brings so much raw power and emotion to his character through the subtleties of his performance alone. Harrison Ford very much returns as the replicant(?) ex-blade runner Rick Deckard and where things have obviously changed in the 30 years he's been existing he still retains many of the personality traits that made Deckard... Deckard. He definitely doesn't phone it in and is compelling as this character who has now seen a lot of shit. But aside from Ford and Gosling the biggest standout of the film and quite possibly my favourite character is Jared Leto's Niander Wallace. Wallace is more or less the new Eldon Tyrell, the man at the head of the new corporation in charge of building replicants and he is such a mysterious and intriguing character I wanted to see more of him. Leto's portrayal of this character is brilliant, he is very creepy and unsettling yet I found myself loving him for his strong willed mindset and importance within this world. There are a number of other strongly compelling roles that I won't go into for various reasons, most of which are to withhold spoilers. \n\nSo in the end there is no doubting the fact that this is a definitive masterpiece, there is not a single second of this film i didn't love and it could very well become one of my favourite movies of all time. The cinematography, score, story, characters, and performances are all so well executed and it is all wrapped up tied with a nice little bow by Denis Villeneuve who continues to prove why he is one of greatest directors working today. Now, do you need to have seen the original film to understand and appreciate this story??? Technically no, you don't, but I would implore you to do so before checking out this movie in order to get the most out of it. I would also definitely check out the three shorts that were released in the lead up to this film as they bridge the gap between the original and this sequel and give you a greater understanding of why the world is the way it is in 2049.\n\n10/10",

The only issue I have is the feeling of sequel bait, if this is to succeed I suspect a sequel will follow shortly after. The film is a spiritual successor to the first film and the pieces fall together to expand the world but closing storylines that were leftover from the first film. Gosling is a great new Blade Runner and he serves the revival well, never looking out of place while maintaining the presence that Ford had in the original. The future outlook is incredible bleak and the world Scott created is serviced by a clear fan. The film has multiple layers and will take another viewing for my excitement to die down. I would've liked more of the iconic score from the first film and a little more focus on the Nexus characters, like the original film did. The film lands on a quiet and somber finale compared to the exciting exit from the final cut, I really suspect there will be a close sequel unlike the 30 year gap between this and the first. The first film gathered an audience over time and while this is early days, I suspect it will divide mainstream audiences looking for an action packed sci fi. I enjoyed the film and will reserve judgment on its longevity when I see it at home. 05-10-2017.",

The highlight and only suspense in the entire movie was scene late in the movie that took place in the ocean. This makes 4 of the last 5 movies from the director where children are at the center of the plot. I suppose that was supposed to be the shocking reveal in this movie but it was flatter than a pancake.\n\nJust re-watched the original 2 days ago and this one pales in comparison, being almost 40 years newer, the visual effects were really nothing spectacular. Not a terrible movie but definitely NOT a great movie by any means, I would argue that those who praise this movie have very very low expectations.",

        {
            "content": "A perfect continuation of the previous film, Blade Runner 2049 masterfully recreates the world of Blade Runner while remaining a very unique and special stand-alone film. In Blade Runner 2049, the question of what makes us humanly persists; the replicants are more advanced and humanistic than ever before, helping make one replicant's journey to discover a purpose or earn a soul as deeply personal as Roy's was in the original. Expanding upon the themes of its predecessor, Blade Runner 2049 also examines different interpretations of love and what the future may behold. All of the different perspectives and ideas that get tossed around in the movie help it to be a thought-provoking experience and go beyond being entertainment. \nWhen it was first announced that Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Sicario) was to be the director, I knew the film was in safe hands. Villeneuve, paired with cinematographer Roger Deakins (Sicario, Skyfall), have created one of the best visual experiences in a movie to date, effectively utilizing today's modern technology to take what the first Blade Runner did and make it even better. The cinematography is the best I've seen all year; there are so many shots where I was just sitting there admiring what was on screen, thinking, \"wow, that's awesome\". There were several different interesting locations in the film and so many cool set designs, which lead to a variety of color grades and lighting. While keeping the darkness and aesthetic of the original, Villeneuve adds his own flair and direction, making the film from start to finish a stylish piece; the future that has been made is wondrous yet not too far-fetched. The animation work and CGI in the film are also stupendous, whether it be a flying car or a hologram, everything looks so real. \nRyan Gosling plays the lead, Officer K, a blade runner like Deckard was, who's good at his job and doesn't say much. Gosling excellently captures the held-back emotion that his character experiences while working on his investigation and slowly starts to let out that emotion as the film progresses. There is one scene in particular where he discovers something big relative to the plot and Gosling's talents are once again put on full display, exhibiting an array of emotions such as anger, fear, and disbelief all in a brief few-second period. Harrison Ford reprises his famous role as Rick Deckard, and while onscreen less than initially expected, Ford is able to craft a new, wisened form of Deckard that adds a whole new layer to the film. Jared Leto plays Niander Wallace, the new Tyrell of sorts, and while he also has less screen time than expected, Leto does what he does best, create an intriguing, complex character. Although some may see Leto's character as the antagonist, his character is more so just morally ambiguous and unpredictable. In this role, Leto flashes disdain and creepiness, while remaining ambiguous enough that you never fully come to understand his character's true intentions, making it hard to label him as something so simple as a bad guy; sorry Leto haters, but he is here to stay. Ana De Armas plays Gosling's love interest in the film, Joi, and brings to the table a heartfelt performance and adds depth and intrigue to a character who is nothing more than an artificial program. De Armas makes you believe that her character is a real person and you feel sympathetic for Joi even though you know there are probably thousands of her out there. The chemistry between Gosling and De Armas is great, as they produce a fantastical romance that is touching to watch while technically not real and is one of the many interesting concepts presented that may or may not occur in the future.  Slyvia Hoeks plays Luv, Niander Wallace's right-hand woman, and is intimidating and intense, specifically during the latter half of the movie. Mackenzie Davis, Robin Wright, and Dave Bautista also add to the many different perspectives and characters we see in the film with their own stories, helping the film truly feel like the grand Sci-Fi opera it is. \n\tIn Blade Runner 2049, even the smaller things make a big difference. The futuristic costume designs that the different characters wear (besides Deckard who just wears a T-shirt) are neat takes on what future fashion will look like, the twists and turns of the story keep the audience engaged and captivated, and the few fight scenes we get are intense, practical, and hard-hitting. Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch's soundtrack stays close to Vangelis' while retaining its own unique style, both ethereal and powerful. \n\tBlade Runner 2049 will most certainly not be for everyone, as its two hours and forty-four-minute runtime can be taxing and the pacing of the film is much more like the tortoise than the hare (although remember, the tortoise ends up beating the hare). The plot won't appeal to everyone either. I recommend watching the original Blade Runner beforehand, preferably the final cut, just to get a taste of what you'll be seeing if you do plan on seeing the new one; receiving context never hurt anybody either. Blade Runner 2049 is a sequel but is also its own story, its own journey, and masterfully expands upon the concepts and features that made the original good; the movie even ends in a way so the potential of a third part is real, assuming the bomb at the box office fixes itself. Blade Runner 2049 is quite possibly the best movie I've seen in 2017, and most certainly will not be lost in time, like tears in the rain.",

Indeed, what does it mean to be human?\n\nRyan Gosling's K wants nothing more than to achieve individuality and rise above his systematic and mundane tasks of \"maintaining order\" for a dying society.\n\nOn the opposite side, Harrison Ford's Deckard is a man who chose to abandon humanity in order to protect what's most important to him. His actions and sacrifices are purely dictated by mankinds' greatest imperative; LOVE. Surrendering his humanity in order to protect that which he loves and cherishes most.\n\nThese two characters paint a stimulating picture of what it means to be human. Replicants manufactured to simulate human consciousness and yet seem to have no true soul; while humans have souls but they've lost their humanity and commit unspeakable acts for the \"greater good.\" \n\nWhat does it mean to be human? The film never answers this question directly, instead leaving the viewer to answer this conundrum for themselves as plot points come and go and the ambiguity gives a distinct richness to the film.\n\nThe film's 2 hour and 43 minutes run time offers an extensive exploration of the frightfully beautiful world that is \"Blade Runner 2049\". What does it mean to be More Human Than Human! It's a beautiful existential crisis.",

The people working on this movie put some real hard work on this movie. The acting was something to be seen. The emotion was astounding and well placed. Don't even get me started on how good the graphics and cinematography look. This is the kind of movie I love. I hope to see sci fi movies on the same level as this one in the near future.

Now the reemergence of serious science fiction at the cinema has made it possible for the noir franchise to return.\n\nThe performances are deep and engrossing, the world building goes further, and the plot is complex. Seriously, don't blink. But remember, this isn't a quick-paced action thriller. This is a slow burner. If you've got the patience to really pay attention for 2 hours and 45 minutes, you're going to witness something truly special. Director Denis Villeneuve only seems to be getting better. \n\nI'm a fan of the original film, especially The Final Cut, but I understand why others aren't. It's not for everyone, and neither is this. This is the height of the genre, but it's not for the kids. \n4.5/5",

All the hype, the joy and the excitement I had going in was gone halfway into the movie.  \n\n2049 is extremely ambitious in what it does and really swings for the fences trying to capture that cinema magic like the original but man it was a huge miss for me.  There will be some savants that truly love what they see but I can earnestly say it is not for everyone.\n\nAt its very core the film does not offer much, the meat and bones of it are dressed up and packaged beautifully but it doesn't make up for the lack of content.  The pacing of the nearly 3 hour film felt very unnecessary and unforgivable at times.  \n\nI've seen the original 3 times and they manage to deliver a great sci-fi thought provoking adventure while delivering serious themes throughout.  They also introduced elements very subtly & ambiguously which is one of the main driving forces that label it a cult classic.  \n\nSadly, this sequel does the exact opposite of that in every way possible.  You're not just spoon fed but force fed symbolism and metaphors that really aren't that thought provoking at all in a constant and blaring fashion.  It makes for a lot of artistic \"ooohhs\" and \"aaahhhs\" but leaves out the main elements of an enjoyable film.\n\nThere was a serious lack of memorable characters & grand scenes which made it very anticlimactic.  The whole time I was waiting for a big reveal and it never came...the whole audience in the theatre looked around at the end with a \"that's it?\" reaction.\n\nOverall I give it a  heartbreaking 6/10.  I walked away thinking that critics were paid or just too enamored by the artistic theatrics.  It would take a lot for me to be able to watch this again but I'd be more than happy to see the original one more time right away.  Maybe my mind is too small for what they were trying to accomplish but my evening was definitely spoiled after watching this.",

It's almost an hour longer than the Director's Cut of Blade Runner, but I found that the running time flew by, so much did the story and the trippy look of the film engross me. Gassner's production design and Deakins's cinematography are gorgeous, doing a good job of matching the look of the first film, while updating and evolving things, and adding greater variety to the environments. The giant Atari billboard made me smile. Oh, and I LOVE the cars. I dislike Jared Leto as an actor, and his typically overcooked performance tests the limits of my tolerance, but all other performances are fine. Gosling and Ford are both incredible, and Ana De Armas and Sylvia Hoeks, who I've never seen before, are very impressive as well. Overall, it's one of the most satisfying sequels I've ever seen, and a strong contender for movie of the year.",

The story is a tad slow, but there is so much happening on screen to observe at any time that there is never a moment of boredom. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford are amazing but so is every single other performance from every single other character. Blade Runner 2049 is very very stylistically different than the original which allows it to stand on it's own as a real film, as opposed to a sequel. The main aspect that blew my opinion of this movie from being great to being a masterpiece is the cinematography, lighting, and special effects. The settings, the rooms, the contrasting lighting, and the special effects that establish a majority of the world we see are all done so unbelievably well that it is almost impossible to describe without showing the entire movie itself.

He could have been left out in a different rewrite but his presence does ensure a sense of continuity and familiarity. \nThe lighting, sound, the pace and mood are fantastic and harken back to you the original.  The sound and music blend together so well. The sets and locations are not as good as the original. It also lacks the feel of a crowded space the original had. The streets seem a little empty.

Actors Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Robin Wright, and Jared Leto are at the top of their game while Ana de Armas and Sylvia Hoeks are standouts in the supporting roles. Take note though, this is a long movie (nearly three hours!) so if you're not into science fiction or the original Blade Runner, I highly suggest you pass on this.

If the guy, who did all that doesn't get a oscar nomination for his work in this... I don't know if I could believe in the people anymore.\nAlso how Denis Villeneuve decided to use some characters name in the story was such an unique idea. How this particular characters effected the main character of Ryan Gosling so much, how they made him feel. Plus how he used the main characters at first random in counter with this case that will change his point of view so much through the movie. And you can feel every change of it wth him. Thanks to Ryans amazing acting. And how at the end of the movie everything changes for him after he made peace with the first change of his story. \nBut I also understand why it didn't made as much at the box office as hoped. It is a hard, nearly 3 hour long watch. How my dad spectacularly showed, when I went to the cinema with him. It is a slow burn and if you aren't interested in the topics it touches on it can be hard.

            "content": "What makes you a human? There is plenty of these type of questions that Blade Runner 2049 always refers back too in this science fiction film that is very much impressive. And I ll admit this, better than the original movie which may shock to all since the first was a cult hit of a movie. I feel like all the credit has to go to director Denis Villeneuve in making a compelling, visually done film. Blade Runner 2049 may not please every one in the audience and it sure will divide the audience either they enjoy it or find it boring. Lets get this straight out in the open. Blade Runner is not the typical Hollywood science fiction action movie were it is loaded with big action set pieces throughout. I ll also admit, this film could have used a little more action but otherwise the movie does well in its storytelling, impressive visuals, and a stunning direction. \n\nI do not want to give too much away about the plot. The less you know the better the movie will be. I ll just give the basic plot outline of a blade runner named K (Ryan Gosling) who hunts down replicants (bioengineered humans) who have been defective. Well on his first case of hunting a replicant, he unearths something that will get the attention from a corporation led by Wallace (Jared Leto) who is trying to perfect a great replicant. And K will need the help of a former blade runner Deckard (Harrison Ford) in order to find answers about what he has discovered that can change everything they once knew. \n\nThe storytelling in this film is what makes it great. It is slow moving in a good way. It does leave you wanting to explore more about the dystopian future. The film spends its time in a futuristic Los Angeles, were its gloomy and flashy with its holograms. Then, K travels to San Diego, were it is a complete wasteland. Where L.A. dumps there massive loads of trash, which literally looks like a huge city of a junkyard. Also, the landscapes of Las Vegas, were it is orange and gloomy from the radioactive. These sequences of different areas does want you to explore more about. Also, K interpersonal relationship with his A.I. device that he carries with him that brings up a hologram of a young woman (Ana de Armas) who can keep him company emotionally or physically. There is plenty of details in the story that the film does take its time with its length. But it never gets boring. \n\nThe visual effects are top notch impressive. Like I mentioned above about the landscapes to its neo noir lighting from the city. And to even make everything better is the music score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. Bringing back the original score theme and adding a few changes does give you that nostalgia feeling when seeing the score volume loud and seeing every shot with the camera done great as it captures the visual sets and effects. \n\nDirector Denis Villeneuve (known for Prisoners, Sicario, and Arrival) if you seen those films. You should know he builds suspense, characters, and overachieves in trying to capture the best shot visually. And a lot of talking throughout the movie. Well the same goes for Blade Runner. He is all about storytelling and respecting the original by exploring further with its plot. He is starting to become one of my favorite directors that can always capture a tone and build its suspense. Sure, my one small issue with the film is it does lack in some action sequences. You get some small brief fight scenes and shooting sequence. And than a flying car chase in the climax. But I only wish there was a bit more to the action. \n\nOtherwise, Blade Runner 2049 is a good science fiction film. The direction and music score is great. The visuals are amazing and hard to take eyes off the screen. Ryan Gosling and the cast ensemble were good. The storytelling is slow moving but works great at being an artistic film than a typical action blockbuster. \n\nI rate the film 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend to see it on the big screen for its impressive music score and visuals of a dystopian future and plot. If you enjoy an artistic science fiction movie or loved the original than this will be a film for you.",

Blade Runner 2049 is my favorite film of the year so far, Denis Villeneuve has now become one of my favorite directors, making a film every year and all of them being great, but here I think he makes his second favorite film I still think Prisoners is better sorry, but the directing in here is just like Ridley Scott which produced it, if he made it and it wasn't shit it would probably be like this, the cinematography here is amazing Roger Deakins has done his best work here with every wide shot being art that you could put on your Mac background, the acting from everyone is amazing Ryan Gosling plays his role very well and Harrison Ford played a very broken character, his best work in years. But Robin Wright, Jared Leto, and Drax the destroyer all play there roles great even Jared Leto who has had like three great performances and the rest being shit, this movie is perfect expect for one thing, when something is reveled instead of just showing it kind of tells you, something Ridley Scott didn't do in the original but thats a nitpick, this movie is huge almost like an epic and it should be remembered for years to come, I plead you to see this movie, if you don't that means studios are going to keep on making Transformers just because they do well.",

It takes super long shots of scenery and actors' expressions, it takes its sweet time moving the plot along, and the delivery of dialogue moves like molasses. These things will undoubtedly turn many moviegoers away, but for those that have an appreciation for film eras like French new wave and Italian neorealism, they should be pleasantly surprised. As a sequel for a film more than 30 years old,  this should not work, and yet it does. Denis Villeneuve manages to deliver a movie that works as a sequel is supposed to, but also can totally stand on its own merits. The performances are great across the board as well, but what makes this film truly great is the beautiful cinematography by roger deakins. Every shot is a painting that would leave me staring in awe. At the very least this film has my vote for best cinematography of the year.",

            "content": "A solid sci-fi film that is a great complimentary piece to the original film. This film right off the bat won't be for everyone. If you've never seen the first film I think you'd be pretty lost here. This movie feels like it was made for fans of the original and it's basically a continuing piece on it from a plot view. Anywho, the movie takes place 30 years after the events of Blade Runner (1982). We follow a Blade Runner (a sort of cop that destroys Replicants {androids} that are on the run) named Officer K (Ryan Gosling). K uncovers the body of a replicant that appears to have birthed a child. This is a disturbing thought to K's handlers because this could start a revolution showing that replicants are more than just servants. K is then tasked with finding the child and taking it out. Meanwhile, Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) has taken over the Tyrell Corporation for the last 30 years and has developed his own replicants that actually obey, but Wallace himself is still trying to find the perfect replicant. He knows about the special replicant and tasks his own right hand woman Luv (Sylvia Hoeks) to kind of trail K and see what he uncovers. The journey leads K down a dark path and furthermore uncovers more and more secrets that will change K and humankind forever. The film also stars Ana de Armas as Joi: a sort of AI that is K's companion throughout the film, and also Harrison Ford returns as Rick Deckard. So here's where the film gets a couple minus points. I found it to be an extremely slow slog. The film has a slow burn and while i enjoyed the outcome a lot of the film feels like the slowest build up ever. There's times that seem like they just want to show you how beautiful the damn movie was shot regardless if it takes ten minutes to do so. There isn't a lot of action, so don't let the trailers fool you. The first film really didn't have much either, but I was expecting just a bit more. Lastly the movie has very little of Ford and Leto. Ford shows up 2 hours in the film (I kid you not) and Leto is literally only in three scenes with a screen time of maybe 10 minutes tops. I liked a lot more than what I didn't though. Gosling is really good here and his few scenes with Ford really do work well. Gosling has that very likeable feel to him and throughout the movie I felt for his character and wanted him to succeed. His interactions with Joi are some of the best and really show how artificial intelligence is how you make of it and see it. The movie is absolutely stunning in the cinematography. It has some of the most beautiful shots I've seen and i really enjoyed how it evolves some scenes from the first film and expands on them. The score of the film works too playing off the original and creating a sense of mightiness and mystery to many scenes. Overall, it's a solid Sci-Fi film. It's made for fans of the first film, so if you enjoyed that one I highly recommend checking this out. So, if you've never seen the first film definitely watch it before this one! Check out the Final Cut that released in 2007 it will make this movie a lot more enjoyable. It's breathtakingly shot and deserves to be seen in theaters. If you don't like sci-fi or a film thats close to 3 hours long maybe wait to rent it, but everyone else go out and see it this weekend!",

It shows general lack of inspiration and originality that is drowning Hollywood. However, I'm not above admitting that there have been successful attempts at both - Nolan's Batman trilogy for one. It shouldn't be a surprise that when I first heard of the idea of a new Blade Runner I was horrified. I loved the original. I loved the ending of the original. Story is over, and we're left to ponder a few questions. I didn't read too much about the project, but I was further worried about Ridley Scott not directing even if he was producing it. I liked a few of the Villeneuve's movies that I've seen but was still disappointed. first thing that intrigued me was Gosling - I like his work and I like his choice of projects (short of LaLa Land). One thing was a certainty - I'd have to see it! \n   I'm happy, satisfied and impressed. The movie hits on all cylinders. It is a really good film that stays true to the original in vision and feel while using the advancements in modern technology to enhance the experience. \n   Same writer helps keep the feeling of continuity, cast did a fantastic job and I could see a couple nominations coming, alongside directing, cinematography and few technicals (I already took the over 9.5 on the nomination count). \n   If I had to point out a flaw, and I should seeing how I took half a star of it would be the length: 167 minutes of the IMAX experience when original in the Final Cut version with all the extended scenes was 117. Extra fifty minutes were felt and could have been condensed by at least 30 through editing as well as story telling. \n   See this movie! See the original first if you haven't. (Final Cut version, albeit edited for tv is available on Syfy on demand.) This is a film with watching on the big screen even with popcorn and pop prices being what they are in movies these days.",

            "content": "Blade Runner 2049 is a coalescence of hazy cityscapes, torrential downpours, and a neon-clad wet dream. It takes turns alternating between astonishing visuals, and looming declarations-all the while a gripping assortment of sounds cascades over everything in sight. The film once makes mention of the space between the stars-and how fitting a metaphor it'd be for its entirety.\n \n2049 (which I'll continue to refer to it as) is the direct sequel to 1982's initially misunderstood Blade Runner, that starred Harrison Ford. This time around we have Ryan Gosling in a somewhat similar role as the Blade Runner-police force solely tasked with eliminating replicants, or androids posing at human beings. And I do use the word 'somewhat' deliberately, but can't go into further detail for fear of spoilers.\n\nWhile 2049 does (at times) try its best to replicate (see what I did there) the cult-classic success of its predecessor, it ends up carving its own path that is both familiar, yet distinctly unique. The film does a standout job of using its larger, scenic views to set the stage for each prominent new scene. It does this in a way that, thankfully, never feels overabundant or unnecessary. A billowing fog covers many of the landscapes you'll encounter, and rarely are we allowed to see much further into the distance. The bleak future of 1982's rendition of the future (if that made any sense) is even more inauspicious and dark than we once knew. Gratuity is a particularly standout visual element, as the denizens of the world try and locate their own form of solace amongst everyday survival. Although he isn't at the film's helm, Ridley Scott's visual flair makes a prominent appearance as the barren landscapes and glowing color palettes echo the visuals of 2015's The Martian. Hans Zimmer once again orchestrates a robust and commanding soundtrack. Intertwine that with the striking visuals, and the end result is visceral spectacle to behold.\n \nReclusiveness and desolation play a large part in how characters behave, and pair perfectly with the locations they come across. Many of 1982's themes of identity and self-discovery also make a welcomed return. Ryan Gosling doesn't stray too far from what you'd expect, but as new discoveries rise to the surface, his character begins to crack, warp, and adapt-and with that, garner a few surprises. He is, however, a large majority of the story. While every supporting cast member plays a pivotal role, it is (for the most part) Gosling leading the way, and he does so in a manner that's akin to a quiet storm brewing. In opposition to him, we have Jared Leto's Wallace: essentially the second coming of the head of the Tyrell Corporation from 1982. His exceptional dialogue delivery manages to evoke an inner sense of malevolence without outwardly displaying chaotic tendencies. Leto possesses the only character with a God-complex, and the ways in which he chooses to express it are subtle and elegant. Even moreso than Gosling, his demeanor is subdued, but in a way that gives off a feeling of disconnect, as if on a higher plane of existence-a result of his so-called achievements.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 retains much of the spirit that 1982 brought, but with it, some of its key detractors. One of the most difficult things to nail in cinema is pacing-and at a runtime of about 2 hours and 45 minutes, the film starts to drag during the latter half. Luckily, the insertion of a key plot point helps alleviate this a bit, but fatigue is certainly a factor that comes into play when watching. In addition to that, 2049 opens a plethora of unanswered questions, so those looking for a 'clean' ending will no doubt long for a more succinct conclusion. That being said, one could argue that it not only does this to pay homage to the original, but also the detective-like noir genre as a whole. Tomato, tom\u00e4to.\n \nAt the very least, I expected 2049 to be an average movie with an outstanding performance from Gosling. I'm happy to report that you can in fact have your future-cake and eat it this time around. While I'm not quite ready to state that 2049 surpasses what the original achieved, it successfully takes pieces of it and creates a modernized version that's much more refined and guided. Time will tell whether or not Blade Runner 2049 ages as gracefully as the original, but I can't say that it didn't firmly make a case for it.",

If your a lover of cinema, you've probably already seen Blade Runner (1982). If you haven't seen it, I suggest doing so, to fully appreciate Blade Runner 2049. This film was highly entertaining in its own right, but If your expecting a Star Wars paced Sci-fi, you may be disappointed, It was not created to compete with that style of movie making. In contrast, you may be pleasantly surprised and enjoy absorbing the atmosphere of the journey it takes you on. You won't find a better team anywhere than Deakin's cinematography and Villeneuve's direction paired with a cast that all bringing their A game.

            "content": "For film fanatics like myself, Blade Runner 2049 is a great film for people to see, regardless if they've witnessed the original or not. On the other hand, if you've never seen the original Blade Runner and are just a casual moviegoer that have thought of the promotion for this film as being an action-packed thrill ride, then I'd have to warn to stay far away from this near three hour motion picture. It's very hard to review this film without getting into specific plot details, but that's exactly what makes this film worth the price of admission alone. For nearly every reason a film fan should be excited about a movie, here is why Blade Runner 2049 is a must see as soon as possible. \n\nBefore dropping you into this world with Ryan Gosling's character, there is text at the beginning that will fill you in on the history of the events in the past, but even though that information is given to you, your experience just won't be the same without having viewed the first film multiple times and remembering the emotional core of it. Set out on a mission to find something of meaning to the overall story, Ryan Gosling's character (who will remain nameless for the sake of this review) uncovers mysteries and secrets from the past, inevitably involving Rick Deckard. Quite honestly, that's the plot in a nutshell and the specifics of the film will lead to ruining your experience, so let's get technical. \n\nIf not for anything else, Blade Runner 2049 benefits from some of the best cinematography I've laid my eyes on in years. From the addition of the seamlessly blended visual effects, to the mind-blowing scenery constructed by the entire art department, I have nothing but praise for this film. Whether or not you find yourself enjoying your experience, the visuals alone should have you applauding, due to their incredibly detailed nature. I personally found the overall film to be magnificent, but when certain scenes were dialogue-free and asking you to gasp at the imagery, that's exactly what I was doing, as I feel many audiences members will. \n\nAgain, without giving anything away, once Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) enters the picture, the way both films sort of interconnect was brilliant in my opinion. It does justice to any loose ends that fans may have wanted in the past, as well as create a new story to gawk at in the process. With a terrifically restrained performance by Ryan Gosling, you'll find yourself sucked into this world as a fly on the wall, as he uncovers these mysteries. With the addition of Harrison Ford giving one of his most sincere and memorable performances, as well as Ana de Armas in a role that really took me by surprise, this film was casted to the nines from beginning to end. Some may complain about Jared Leto and Dave Bautista not being included as much, but I felt as though the served the story quite nicely. \n\nIn the end, this movie aims to impress Sci-Fi fans across the world, but I feel as though the people who will be looking back on this as a possible classic or at least one of the best sequels ever made, are those who've had the pleasure of indulging in the greatness that is 1982's Blade Runner. I don't say this about films very often, especially when talking about sequels, but I haven't been this immersed in a theatrical experience in quite some time. This is definitely a superior film than the original, it's one of the best films of 2017, and I'll be revisiting it very soon. Blade Runner 2049 is getting a lot of praise and awards consideration from critics and filmgoers across the world, and every bit of it is deserved. Aside from being very long, this is pretty much a perfect film if you don't try to nitpick how it connects and certain questions that aren't blatantly answered. If you know what type of film you're in for, or you've at least seen the original and enjoyed it, I can't recommend this movie enough.",

But the story is so immersive and it moves. I saw it in 3D and it added to the experience.  The soundtrack was really good and it was like a darker Vangelis score that really worked with the feel of the movie.  I loved the visuals, the costumes, the special effects and the acting.  Ryan Gossling and Harrison Ford are really good in this, as is the rest of the actors.  This movie will be around for awhile, it won't be lighting any fires but it'll definite be talked about months or years after it has been released.

            "content": "Given that Blade Runner 2049 was released in theaters almost three weeks ago, I understand that I am very late to the review party. I wanted to see the film on its opening weekend, but since I hadn't seen the original Blade Runner I decided to wait. I finally got around to watching Ridley Scott's sci-fi classic last week after ordering the Blu-Ray from Amazon, so I was officially prepared to go see the new one. I finally got around to doing it on Tuesday night, braving 40-degree temperature and cold rain to make it to the movie theater on my bike. However, all the waiting and endurance of harsh weather paid off.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 takes place 30 years after the events of the original, and once again is set in the futuristic, dystopian Los Angeles, which has turned into a dark, rainy megalopolis populated by a diverse mix of cultures and people of all shapes and sizes. The main character here is K, played by Ryan Gosling, who is a \"blade runner\" who works for the LAPD. Blade runners, for those of you who don't know, hunt down and kill older model \"replicants,\" which are essentially artificially-created humans used for slave labor in \"off-world\" colonies (i.e., other planets). In the film, K is the latest model of the replicant, a model that is only legal due to its strict obedience to its superiors. I won't give you much more background about the film, since even the vaguest information about the film's plot crosses the line into spoiler territory. When I walked out of this film, I was speechless. But not in the way you might think: I expected myself to fall in love with the film (which, for the most part, I did), but I left the theater with emotions and conflicting opinions swelling up in my brain. So, I decided to wait to write my review and develop an opinion on the film, to give it a couple of days to sink in. After intense thought on the film and its execution, as well as reviewing discussions and forums on the film online, I have arrived at my conclusion.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 is a fantastic science-fiction masterpiece unparalleled in its visual beauty, sound editing, and themes. It is unique in the fact that it exists to be a film, not a movie. I like to distinguish between those two words (although I often use them interchangeably), because each have a different connotation. A movie, in my opinion, follows more along the lines of a blockbuster. Movies are made to entertain, to make money, or to set up some sort of cinematic universe. They can be good, yes, and some of my favorite cinematic pieces are indeed movies. Film, on the other hand, constitutes something much different. Films are made to showcase acting, to explore deep themes about our human condition, or to tell a real, genuine story. Films are not concerned with satisfying fans or setting up a film universe. Rather, they focus on trying to tell focused stories that don't need sequels. Blade Runner 2049 is, first and foremost, a film. And it is a damn good one. It does things I haven't seen a film do in a long time.\n\nFirst of all, the cinematography and the visuals on display here are breathtaking. Like the original Blade Runner, much of the story told in 2049 is told visually. We are given little dialogue to inform us as to what is going on or what kind of universe the story in set in. Instead, we are treated to long, beautiful shots of the environment, which provide details regarding the state of mankind and its planet. Second of all, the sound editing is some of the best I have heard in a while, comparable to another one of my favorite films, Arrival (which, probably not coincidentally, is also directed by Denis Villeneuve). Third of all, the acting is all-around terrific. Gosling does a fantastic job as K portraying a replicant that sometimes shows no emotion but also sometimes shows very intense emotion. It is obvious that he is a sad, broken character who wants to find his purpose in the world, and it is portrayed brilliantly. Harrison Ford also does an awesome job, thankfully, and his performance in the film is nuanced and welcomed. Finally, another thing that the film does an excellent job at is exploring the theme of humanity. Namely, what is it that makes us human? Is it our tendency for conflict? Is it our ability to shed emotion? Is it the fact that we can give birth to children? What distinguishes humans that are born from humans that are made? Is it the presence of a soul? All of those questions are things the film explores, and it gives it a powerful undertone.\n\nMy one issue with Blade Runner 2049 is the slow pacing of it. Granted, I knew this was an inevitable fact about the film. Like the original, the events in the film happen very slowly, and rarely do things pick up to an intense, teeth-grinding moment. As someone who can't sit still for very long, it presented a problem for me that prevented me from enjoying the film as much as I wanted to. Regardless of that, I am still determined to buy the film upon its release and watch it multiple times. It is the type of film to make you want to do that, since you will get something new from it every time. In the end, Blade Runner 2049 is a long science-fiction epic. Understandably, not everyone will enjoy it because of the length and pacing. However, if you are the type of person to critically analyze the quality of a film and absorb the messages it serves to you, you are going to love it. I give Blade Runner 2049 4 out of 5 stars, and I hope that I will happily add the final star onto it once I've watched it again.",

Really asking the question of what make a human, human. Now the sequel movie to blade continues are journey. We are told right at the beginning that the new blade runner isn\u2019t human and a newer version of these replicants. They through in a twist to make you question weather he is or not a newer model or not. This mystery is not something really defines the movie. As well the mystery that K our new blade runner unearth isn\u2019t all that mysterious and we are hand fed the answer in three short flash back clips. To I feel that this generation of directors are scared to leave there watching questioning and scared to leave a mystery unsolved. That ok to do sometime giving an answer to every single thing is not needed all the time what I would have rather had was k not to have peice together the mystery off of hearing one thing. Who the kid is doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the memory of the horse and how that effected him. He wanted to be that baby because he felt like then he\u2019d have a soul which is what made humans human. With all that said At the end of this movie when your done watching ask yourself did he have a soul was he human in his eyes is that what was suppose to be taken away from this movie. What does make a human human this is what all the future movie like blade runner I Robot all have in common they all ask that question at one point",

They want action, shaky cam, something to get their heart racing. This isn't what Blade Runner 2049 stands for. Its heart lies in its world, in its characters. So much has been invested in the character growth and the blurred line between man and replicant. Every time the action slows and we are given these long instances of silence or mellow dialogue, it's not pointless or boring, the film gives time and a lot of it to the characters, and what each one of them stand for. When the action is there, it demands your attention, it plows through the scene with grace, precision, and volume. The cinematography here is some of the greatest I've ever witnessed in my life, there are some competitors but I don't remember a time when I caught myself with my mouth open as much as I did in the perfect run time of 2 Hours and 44 minutes. There are movies in the world, so many of them, but rarely you come across a film. A cinematic masterpiece that I will be coming back to for years to come. I appreciated the 1982 original, however I never flat out loved it. I had my nitpicks and noticed flaws. But here, Blade Runner 2049 is probably one of the greatest, if not the greatest, film I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. Find the biggest and loudest screen and watch this on it.

You can go into Blade Runner expecting some great mystery into it and It surprisingly does that which I also thought was great.

I was captivated by it all the way through and it's by far the best film of Denis Villeneuve's career\"\nMovie Review: Blade Runner 2049\nDate Viewed: October 6 2017\nDirected By Denis Villeneuve (Incendies, Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario and Arrival)\nScreenplay By Hampton Fancher and Michael Green, Story By Hampton Fancher, Based on characters from \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" by Philip K. Dick\nStarring: Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright, Carla Juri, Mackenzie Davis, Dave Bautista, Lennie James, David Dastmalchian, Barkhad Abdi, Hiam Abbass, Wood Harris, Jared Leto and Edward James Olmos.\n\nWhen director Ridley Scott's sci-fi noir \"Blade Runner\" first came out in 1982, critics and audiences were split about it. Some people said that it was a ground-breaking achievement in visual artistry but it's detractors said that it was confusing and too grim for it's own good. I never saw the original cut of \"Blade Runner\" but I heard that people hated it because of Harrison Ford's annoying narration. When I saw \"The Final Cut\" for the first time on Blu-Ray, I blown away by it. \"Blade Runner\" became one of my all-time favorite movies and as of this day, people are still trying to figure out if Rick Deckard is a replicant. If you were hoping to find the answers in \"Blade Runner 2049\", you will likely be disappointed.\n\nDenis Villeneuve's film is not only just as visually striking and emotionally compelling as it's predecessor, it also expands on it's ideas and futuristic world that made the first \"Blade Runner\" an instant sci-fi classic. Yes, it's futuristic look at Los Angeles might be bleak but it's also beautifully shot by the great cinematographer Roger Deakins. \"Blade Runner 2049\" might be very long (2 hours and 43 minutes) but I was captivated by it and this is by far the best film of Denis Villeneuve's career.\n\nI will try my best not to spoil any details about \"2049\" because people have been waiting for this sequel for so long and they want to know if it's any good. Does it live up to the original? Yes it does. Set thirty years after the first film, we now follow a new replicant \"blade runner\" named K (Ryan Gosling), his job is to hunt down and retire rogue older model replicants who have since gone into hiding.\n\nK lives in an apartment with his holographic girlfriend named Joi (Ana de Armas). She's an artificial intelligence product of the Wallace Corporation which is run by tycoon inventor Niander Wallace (Jared Leto). Wallace has created replicants who are more subservient and strong than their pre-2019 predecessors from the Tyrell Corporation and he wants all the older models eliminated including former LAPD blade runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who has been missing since the events of the first film. When K hunts down and kills a rogue replicant (Dave Bautista), he discovers a buried box. Forensic analysis reveals that the box contains remains of a female replicant who died of complications from an emergency caesarean section.\n\nK wants to find out more about the mystery he uncovered but his superior Lt. Joshi (Robin Wright) wants him to destroy all evidence related to the case and retire the dead female replicant's child. K's investigation leads him into finding Rick Deckard who now lives in an isolated mansion in the ruins of Las Vegas. The interplay between Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford is one of the best aspects of \"Blade Runner 2049\" and they both give terrific performances. Roger Deakins has to take home the Best Cinematography Oscar next year because his futuristic photography is so breathtakingly gorgeous. He has been nominated for cinematography 13 times already and he has never won, don't you think it's time for you Academy voters to finally give Mr. Deakins his damn Oscar!\n\nThe production design is also crafted very well, the editing by Joe Walker (12 Years a Slave, Arrival and Sicario) is efficient, the visual effects are of course amazing and spectacular and the screenplay by Michael Green (Green Lantern, Logan and Alien: Covenant) and Hampton Fancher (Blade Runner, The Mighty Quinn and The Minus Man) brilliantly keeps the tone of \"2049\" very serious. The supporting cast is also superb, Ana de Armas gives a star-making performance as K's holographic girlfriend, Sylvia Hoeks is a pure standout as Luv, Wallace's steely-eyed henchwoman and Jared Leto makes for an interesting antagonist. Edward James Olmos also makes an appearance reprising his role as Gaff who we see complete one last origami figure.\n\n\"Blade Runner 2049\" is a film that must be seen on the biggest screen you can find in your local theater. If you don't have IMAX in your city or town, that's a shame because you don't know what your missing. While the original \"Blade Runner\" had brilliantly powerful ideas, themes and visions, \"2049\" further expands them in a way that's both universal and extraordinary. This is a big-budget sequel that respects your intelligence and your time. \"Blade Runner 2049\" manages to be both an ambitious sci-fi film and a great sequel.",

            "content": "The advent of mainstream science fiction in recent year seems to have largely run parallel to dug-up sequels. If the former is a human, the latter is a replicant, and in that way, Blade Runner 2049 operates a plane a bit more unique than similar films of recent memory. While that provides for some incredible filmmaking, it also causes aspects of the film to come off as a bit maddening, although the good definitely outweighs the bad here. This is pretty much a technical masterwork from beginning to end with some of the most standout cinematography of recent years, making the argument for Roger Deakins's eventual Oscar win even more impossible to deny. From a narrative perspective, though, Blade Runner 2049 can be aggravatingly sparse and sometimes bombastic, taking too much time to say what it wants to. When the pieces fall into place, though, it's spellbinding. 30 years after the original film, updated replicants are now part of society in order to help the continuation of humanity. K (Ryan Gosling) is a new blade runner, hunting down and retiring the older model replicants, who comes across the remains of a replicant who appears to have been pregnant at the time of her death. This leads him to track down Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who's been missing since the events of the first film. With a general synopsis this bare-bones and a runtime of 163 minutes, it's natural to anticipate a script that's either jam-packed with themes, development, and twists to chew on, or one that would be hollow. The end result is somewhere in the middle, closer to the former. What does work at all times (save for a few fleeting moments) are the visuals, which are stellar. Deakins puts out his cinematography since Skyfall, a barrage of eye candy that's in turns sleek and dusty. Taking the neo-noir aesthetic from the first film and injecting it with visual senses of thematic progression and a more distinct identity, he allows different scenes and locations to thrive in different ways that still flow together, keeping a consistent visual style. It can be breathtaking to behold, and as glib as it sounds, it can also be jaw-dropping to witness such fluidity in the form of a man with a movie camera. The score from Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch is largely background noise and intentionally so; the synthesized humming and occasional jolts of aural energy are more meant to be complimentary to the visuals. This works well, save for one or two moments where its vying for attention can be distracting. Denis Villenueve's direction, while not quite perfect, carries on his willingness to hold shots and let settings breathe, an artistic choice that's much needed in blockbuster filmmaking. The flaws in Villenueve's direction aren't wholly his fault; the largely stem from a script that can at times be thin. Co-writers Hampton Fancher and Michael Green-the former of who also holds a story by credit-continue with the ideas that the original Blade Runner catapulted into the zeitgeist in 1982, and the choices are intriguing and philosophically sound. It's wiser not to mention them because of their associations with plot points later on, but it can be said that Fancher and Green take too much time conveying their messages. This is a 163-minute film that could have been 140 minutes, and the decisions have a first act that's almost 45 minutes and a midpoint that arrives later than preferred dilutes the material at the core of the movie. The amount of time spent on world-building is odd given the fact that every person already seeing Blade Runner has gained a sense of its universe through osmosis whether they know it or not, and a few cringe-worthy lines of dialogue don't help either. Blade Runner 2049 is a movie that is both recommendable and unlikely to encourage itself to multiple viewings because of how overcooked some of its most tender meat is. It's stunning to look at; there's always something to digest even when the movie isn't moving as steadily as it needs to. It is, at its worst, a bit dull, but it is never boring. An odd and unnecessary male-gazey approach to some content feels like unsubtle attempts to cater to younger audiences, but it still knows who it really is for. After seeing the film's underwhelming weekend box office numbers, it remains to be seen whether or not that audience will actually show up. They should, though, because even with its bumps, Blade Runner 2049 often feels as smooth as silk-covered steel. 7.7/10, good, B, above average, etc.",

            "content": "The original Blade Runner released to theaters in 1982 and was met with a middling response, enough so that it was considered both a financial and critical failure. The film did garner a small cult following and there were rumors of a director's cut that enhanced the film. Over the next ten years the film started to grow in popularity and Ridley Scott released the long rumored cut. This new version of the film drew even more attention and began to be talked about with great admiration as the deep themes of existence and the human condition were explored further, and the mystery of the ambiguity of its main character captured many people in long conversations of \"human or replicant.\" It grew again in popularity and began to impress on a new generation of filmmakers; it influenced a whole look of a future dystopia. But like many artists, Scott was still not completely pleased with this version and fifteen years after the release of his \"Director's Cut,\" put together the definitive version of the film simply named \"The Final Cut.\" It is in this version that Blade Runner became known to be a sci-fi masterpiece and a beloved film for many movie fans. When the sequel to Blade Runner was announced, there was a lot riding on the film in stacking up to the original, considering the state of Hollywood today and their bastardizing of previous decades' films in the hopes of making a quick buck. However, Ridley Scott now in the Executive Producer role, brought together a team that would continue not only the story of the first, but further the ideas and conversations that were at the heart of Blade Runner. Blade Runner 2049 is not only a worthy successor to the original, but grows the legacy of this epic, highbrow tale.\n\nWhile Blade Runner 2049 is filled with gorgeous shots crafted by cinematographer Roger Deakins and shot by the talented and highly sought Denis Villeneuve, the performances by its small cast of actors is what resonates the most upon leaving the theater. Ryan Gosling's turn as Agent K is one of the greatest performances of emotion bubbling under the surface and quiet observation possibly ever seen. It shouldn't be surprising that this will be considered a career defining performance that depends more on expression; a fact conceded by the limited amount of dialogue that he engages. The standout performer in Blade Runner 2049 is the Cuban born Ana De Armas. Armas might be the film's most human character despite her transparent form. Her loving connection to K, is a connection she also shares with us because we view the story through K's eyes. This makes for a touching and palpable relationship with one of the year's best supporting characters instantaneously. Diving into the depths and the complexity of Joi and her role in the film would all but spoil most of the film and I don't want to ruin what would be a captivating first hand experience with these characters and the dynamics they share. Rounding out the cast of characters is Sylvia Hoeks and Jared Leto as the film's antagonists, Luv and Niander Wallace. The CEO and architect of Wallace Corporation and his multi-job assistant are used sparingly in the film, though the few scenes that feature them do a well enough job of keeping their presence felt throughout. Robin Wright as Lieutenant Joshi brings the hardened, grizzled aspect to the film and keeps Agent K's mentality in check. Much like she did in her minor role in Wonder Woman, Wright is a huge influence on our lead character and her influence still shows in our hero as they progress through the story. Lastly, Harrison Ford returns as Rick Deckard and turns in what is certainly his best performance in years. So much so, that talks have begun circling in spaces around the web of a possible \"Best Supporting Actor\" nomination during next year's Academy Awards. While I personally wouldn't go that far, Ford becomes the emotional anchor to the film as he brings a sense of warmth and familiarity to the film.\n\nThis is director Denis Villeneuve's (Sicario, Arrival) first attempt at a film that is a part of a pre-existing franchise. The original Blade Runner is one of Villeneuve's favorite films and signing on to direct the sequel must have been a huge honor and a terrifying task. Working his magic like Villeneuve usually does, he has led the crafting one of the finest tuned pieces of filmmaking this side of the 2000s has seen. Villeneuve teams up with 13 time Oscar nominated Cinematographer Roger Deakins for a third time, and the German-born composer Hans Zimmer for the first time to try and make the sights and sounds of Los Angeles 2049 come to life. Fortunately for us this trio here is able to compose striking frames, magnetic sound composition, and partnering that with knee buckling production design makes Blade Runner 2049 a comfortably numb experience. As we embark on this journey, Villeneuve is able to use the camera to convey a longing for purpose, self-discovery, and the human condition. It's tightly focused frames that linger on characters and the backdrop of a dystopian Los Angeles that Villeneuve uses to his advantage in making us connect with the world because it evokes the thirst for existence that the characters are feeling. Deakins' cinematography is other worldly as he captures the large and eye popping corporation buildings that cast a shadow over the lowly beings that walk the paths of the drenched Los Angeles area. Some buildings of the past still stand as a reminder of what's come before, being used as a visual aid to remember that without the past we wouldn't have come as far as we have, and using that to inspire us to achieve bigger and better things. Villeneuve's ability to emit a feeling of claustrophobia is something he has brought to the table in each of his films thus far. His use of concentrated camerawork and small spaces constructs scenes that are more personal, and the dialogue that is exchanged between performers adds an inescapable intensity to every scenario. The use of lighting here is one of the biggest technical standouts in the film, and Villeneuve's casting of light or shadow upon the actors is a fascinating move. Deakins highlights this choice by enhancing the effects of light and shadow through his sharp shot composition and using that almost as if it were music because of the harmony it may bring, or the darkness that has befallen the characters. What may be flying under the radar during the experience with the film is how the sound design is utilized in small places. There is a stillness in many of those scenes that contain brief moments of the scuffing of a boot or a faucet suffering from pressure problems. It gives the world a sense of being in a dystopian wasteland and the occasional sounds we hear are that of the sparse wildlife that inhabit it.\n\nThe general consensus seems to agree that Zimmer's score for the film is one of the weakest points because of the overbearing nature of the music. While the film occasionally suffers from a score that may seem like it's outdistancing the rest of the film, it still feels like it belongs in that world. It's a score that is reminiscent of the original Vangelis score that may give the fans a feeling of nostalgia of the synth driven scores from many 80's sci-fi films. One of the biggest causes for concern heading into Blade Runner 2049 was the imposing runtime of 164 minutes. As the predecessor ran 114 minutes and being able to do and say so much during that time, many believed that an extra hour of the neo-noir realm of Blade Runner may take it's toll and become a tedious effort rather than an exhilarating one. The film never wastes a single moment and Villeneuve constantly grabs our attention with each frame that moves before our very eyes. The way the plot unfolds keeps you enthralled and locked in with the narrative as it has you thirsting for the next bit of information that is yet to be revealed. This makes the runtime fly by with ease and when the film concludes it feels as if you've lived an entire lifetime during that duration. There are minor concerns heading into the film and very little amount of errors that may only end up arising based on your personal tastes. As mentioned previously, Blade Runner 2049 is a fine tuned effort with minimal room for error and Warner Bros., Denis Villeneuve, and the entire production showed up each and every day to deliver one of the most complete science-fiction films this century has seen.\n\nBlade Runner 2049, as you have read, is one of the best films of the year. It's a powerful and emotional journey through the life of the eyes of another. A film that has the ability to transport us into a realm that looks significantly different from the one we know, but feels eerily familiar because it's a path we're trending towards as a society. Blade Runner 2049, like all of Villeneuve's filmography defies genre expectations, and gives each moment the right amount of care and attention it deserves to showcase the human spirit triumphing in the darkest of times. Whether it's the figurative representation of purgatory saving a child of God from the grasps of the figurative representation of the devil, or a daughter discovering that her mathematical prowess can't help her solve all of life's problems, Denis Villeneuve understands what it takes to make his films resonate with audiences on a personal level. We are so immersed in the worlds and stories he creates because he takes us on a journey while holding our hand. Not in a way where he points at everything we see and explains it, but he allows the worlds and characters he builds to speak for themselves. That is why his entire filmography has such a unique, powerful, and inspiring voice not only to the medium, but to life itself. Blade Runner 2049 deals a lot with themes like \"existence\" and \"humanity\", and Villeneuve chooses to explore that here in such a profound and poignant way. Each scene feels imperative, and each character decision, action, or reaction holds so much emotional weight because we are given a reason to care for their journey. Earlier I briefly mentioned \"The Human Condition\", and in my personal opinion that is what Villeneuve prioritized in the underlying theme of the narrative. The Human Condition is, \"the characteristics, key events, and situations which compose the essentials of human existence, such as birth, growth, emotionality, aspiration, conflict, and mortality.\" All of which are put on display in Blade Runner 2049. Not just for a single character, but multiple. Characters who experience birth, who grow up, who go through and begin to feel emotions and how they react to a stimulus. Then comes aspiration where characters are hopeful or ambitious in achieving a goal, and following that is their conflict along the way of attempting to achieve that goal, and finally having to confront mortality in the end. Blade Runner 2049 is a beautifully composed, constructed, and epic science-fiction odyssey of a lifetime that has a personal and human touch lying underneath it's ravishing canvas of visuals.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 gets a 98/100",

Leto beings a calm intensity to the role of Wallace and makes the audience fear him, in the short amount of time he is there. Even when he isn't on screen you feel his presence throughout the story. Ana de Armas as Joi was breathtaking. She captures the audience with her soft spoken way combined with her warmth of love towards K. You can truly feel her affection towards K and visa versa. Harrison Ford reprises his role as Deckard and does a fantastic job. It felt like he never stepped away from the role all those years ago. Ryan Gosling doesn't say much, but when he does it is profound and has a lot of weight to it. Even without speaking Gosling's character, K, shows audience what the character is feeling. The real star of this film however, is Denis Villenueve. His directing style fits this world perfectly. No other director, that isnt Ridley Scott, could have recaptured the feeling of this universe. I can't begin to describe the visual beauty this film brings to the table thanks to Roger Deacons. This is a must see and best movie of 2017 hands down, as of right now.

Blade Runner 2049 is directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green. The film stars Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, who reprises his role as Rick Deckard, with Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright, Mackenzie Davis, Carla Juri, Lennie James, Dave Bautista and Jared Leto in supporting roles.\n\nThis is what film should be. I keep saying that every single time of the film that I like. But so to say this is a long waiting sci-fi action films that I've been waiting for. Everyone keeps telling me that Star Wars is the best sci-fi film ever been put onto the big screen. Even so to say 2001 a space Odyssey is the best sci-fi film ever put on the screen. But the first blade runner from I believe is the best sci-fi film. Truly to say but all changes when I saw blade runner 2049. \n\nThis is why I appreciate film, this is what drives me to get to the movie theater. For one thing people will not like this film because of the slow pacing and the noair tone that gives us for the two Blade Runner films. Visually it is amazing to analyze. Cinematography by Roger Deakins is breathtaking this whole film top to bottom is Oscar worthy all the way. But what I like the most about Blade Runner 2049 that it is its own movie. Yes it is the sequel to blade runner, but growing the world a blade runner it's breathtaking and miraculous.\n\nRyan Gosling it's growing towards to be one of my favorite actors working today. Drive is one of my favorite films of 2011, possibly easily in my top 10 of the decade. Then we have The Nice Guys, La La Land, and countless more. Except the notebook that is just horrifically bad. I'm just tired of everyone thinking that Ryan Gosling is a bland actor. But this film shows that he gave us 110% of his performs. Everybody in the film especially the director growing up at saying blade runner change their lives. For keeping us a true story of the universe Blade Runner. \n\nHarrison Ford is only in the third act the film but it all ties in with his suspension throughout the film. His presence was there!  Jared Letto was only in the film for only two sceans. Maybe more I didn't even count. But I have a strong feeling if they ever have a sequel, I think there will be more. Plus with all the countless mini short films that they been reaching out to promote this film is brilliant. Go see all of them there amazing. There are countless scene without Harrison Ford and Ryan gosling that is just in aw. Every single visual every single shot is a masterpiece ages looks like a beautiful painting throughout the two hours and 30 minutes of this film. \n\nComparing Blade Runner to Star Wars, yes I love Star Wars. But I only like Star Wars 1977, and the Empire Strikes Back. Throughout the whole saga, I really don't care. Yes I'll go into the theater with high expectations. But when I keep getting up to go to the theater. I get very disappointed. Tears ago I gave a positive grade Star Wars episode seven 9/10. Only because it is just a good action film. It is not a good sci-fi film. I'm only am hoping that the last Jedi proves that Star Wars is still alive and well. As I did say that it's been a long awaiting to see a great sci-fi film, and I mean that play runner 2049 is hands-down the best sci-fi film yet. \n\nBlade Runner 2049 gave  the audience a lot of suspense, a great handful of action, a great story, great characters and I mean it very great characters. Sorry this review did not contain any plots or anything because I want respective the director of what he gave us. I really don't want people to know the plot line. This film has to be experience in theaters. Denis Villeneuve and Ridley Scott made yet another great sci-fi film. \n\nDenis Villeneuve is now a master of film. I always ask myself. What happened to all the masters where are the new masters. Where are the new Martin Scorsese's, where is the new Stanley Kubrick, where is the next Akira Korasawa? Even yet where is the next Steven Spielberg. Yes I am proud to say that Christopher Nolan is one of those masters, but I strongly know that Denis Villeneuve is a new master. Movies he directed like Sicario, Enemy, Prisoners, Arival, and now Blade Runner 2049. Every single year when I make my favorite movies of the year, his movies is always on it. \n\nDon't make this film Mad Max Fury Road or Edge of Tomorrow. I am disappointed with the low box office rating right now go see it!!! NOW!! \n\nGrade: A Perfect 10",

            "content": "I was pretty lucky enough when I saw the final cut of \"Blade Runner,\" and it was much better than the original one. Whether if it's perfect or not, at least this one manages to stretch out its plot more, and give us more details of these characters and the environment world of the story. After making last year's \"Arrival,\" (which I considered it my favorite film of 2016), French-Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve has volunteered to direct this sequel, and for what I can say about his approach is that it honors the original and presents new ideas all around it.   \n\nThe first \"Blade Runner\" raises questions about what it means to be alive and what it means to be human. In the sequel, it does present these elements in a very respectful way, but since this is directed by the talented man who made \"Arrival,\" there are also similarities between his previous film and this one as well, given the fact that it's going deeper into Ryan Gosling's character, K, and flashbacks of his past memories. \n\nThe best moments of \"Blade Runner 2049\" is whenever the film is not using any dialogues, and let the images and the sound to tell its story, which comes down to my favorite part where Ryan Gosling is walking alone and finds a wooden horse, the same one he remembers in his memories. Just the way how the music or the sound carries on, and Ryan Gosling making a shocking face to himself, I was amazed by that part.  I did find some of the dialogues to be somewhat flawed, but I also think, as a whole, it was smartly written, for the most part. The cinematography, (which was done by the talented Roger Deakins), is absolutely stunning. He's great whenever he's doing angles, but he's also great whenever he makes his shots so beautiful and colorful as it needs to be. Other great points are the music, the production design, the sound effects and, of course, the visual effects.\n\nRyan Gosling is amazing as usual, even though he's much closer to \"Drive\" than \"La La Land.\" Harrison Ford as Deckard doesn't appear until near the end of the film, but he's terrific nevertheless and the way how they developed his character does a much better job than the first one did. Even though Jared Leto as the replicant manufacturer, Wallace, and Dave Bautista as a rogue replicant, Sapper, are not in the film that much, it does features a strong supporting cast that includes Ana de Armas as K's holographic girlfriend, Joi, (pretty similar to Scarlett Johansson in Spike Jonze's \"Her\"), and Sylvia Hoeks as Wallace's icy, ruthless enforcer, Luv.\n\nUnlike \"Arrival,\" it does build its story and characters very slowly, (which the film is about 164 minutes long), but it's definitely not without its ambitions. \"Blade Runner 2049\" is more challenging and engrossing than entertaining. It's a sequel that manages to be much closer to not only \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" but more likely, \"The Godfather: Part II.\" My full opinion: 9.3/10.",

When a sequel for Blade Runner was announced, everybody wasn't pleased with it as the first one is a classic enough as it is, but I was curious about it because Denis Villeneuve is the director of this film, and I've enjoyed a lot of his films so far, and it even has one of the original writers for the first Blade Runner name Hampton Fancher. So with this being one of the most anticipated films of 2017 for me, I wanted to see this in IMAX, but since my friend, who also enjoyed the first one, didn't have much money to see it, we went  to see it in regular theaters, and we have the same thought that we actually love it, while my other friend who has never seen Blade Runner, was pretty indifferent to the sequel. The acting is fantastic, whether it be from Ryan Gosling as he fit his character of what he is, while also acting intimidating when he's playing it a bit monotonous. Harrison Ford is at his best here as he's also intimidating, but he also have some emotional moments when he had to deal with the events from the first one, which this is one of his bests in recent years. Robin Wright is great in it which I'm glad to see her getting some movie work, and Ana de Armas was a surprise as she was in Knock Knock, which she was terrible in that, and she's really convincing here as Ryan Gosling's girlfriend. Sylvia Hoeks is intimidating to the point of being terrifying, and Jared Leto did a lot better here of being weird than he did in Suicide Squad. The story is really good that expanded on the world that is created here, and the writing by Hampton Fancher and Michael Green really seem to understand what make the first one so successful with fans and critics. For those who have pacing issues with the first one for being way too slow, the pacing in this is faster than the first one, but not by much as this is still slow, and it's more than 2 and a half hours long, so I wouldn't know if some people would get through this. The story is interesting enough that I never find this movie to be boring, and while this is really long, there's never a scene that was unnecessary or dragged on. The characters are three-dimensional enough that you understand their motivations that they have, and they're smart that I wasn't quite sure where it's going. The effects and the cinematography by Roger Deakins is the highlight of the film because the effects are the best that I've seen in recent years whether they put in computer, practical and production design effects, it's really impressive how much they took their time, and it definitely felt like it made a new world out of this, while the world looks like it's from the first Blade Runner. Roger Deakins did a fantastic job of making almost every shot look like effort here, and  it makes the movie look grand in scale, which would make me irritated if he doesn't get an Oscar for this. While the marketing for this make it seem like this is going to be an action film, and that's not necessarily the case here as this is more of a dystopian science fiction mystery here just like the first one. There are some action scenes that are entertaining to watch, that's not the focus of this film. Even though Harrison Ford isn't in this that much as it focuses the most of Ryan Gosling, the first meeting between Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford is probably the best Sci-Fi moments because the way it's set up is very inventive, and the songs that have a purpose here really work that it can be use as a horror set piece for that scene. Speaking of songs, the score by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch is great that makes this sound like an epic. Doing a sequel to Blade Runner that's as good or better may seem impossible, but Denis Villeneuve, Hampton Fancher, Michael Green, and Roger Deakins achieve the impossible as Blade Runner 2049 for me is better than the original, is either the best sequel since Terminator 2: Judgement Day, or it's one of the best sequels that I've seen, and I'm looking forward to seeing Denis Villeneuve's version of Dune when it gets created.",

He somehow managed to make a sequel to a cult-classic be somehow not only great on it's own two feet, but somehow even be better than the original Blade Runner. I'm, such at a loss of words right now I can't describe it. Round applause to this damn filmmaker for actually doing it, one i've been active supporting since I saw Enemy in theaters and as well as my favourite film of 2015 Sicario. So yes, as you can probably tell I came back from Blade Runner 2049, a sequel to a film that ultimately didn't need one but left some wiggle room for there to be a film set in that universe, absolutely floored and amazed by just how much Denis managed to seriously, and I mean this one hundred percent with no over-exaggeration, make this film somehow actually this film work. \n\nNow before though I gush over it, i should preference that smaller issues (which are normal for any film and thankfully don't take away from any heavy positives this film offers) such as often coincidental moments, often cheesy flashbacks, the story while competently told and does have some I think good twists did feel too straightforward and predictable, a bit of an annoying jump cuts that kind of break continuity with some scene transitions, and just Jared Leto's character feeling a bit too pointless for the film though thankfully redeemed himself performance wise after the disaster that was Suicide Squad do lean be back from making me fully liking the film, I can thankfully say everything else presented here is what's worth talking about. \n\nFirst off worth mentioning: The fucking spot on direction by Denis Villeneuve and his feel being present through the film and making it feel like both a film set in Blade Runner but also maintained a look that had his signature feel as a director, the absolutely must be emphasized GOREGOUS cinematography Roger Deakins offers that is so fantastic it's gonna make me actually mad if he doesn't win an oscar at this point, a score by Hans Zimmer that while sure isn't as iconic as Vengelis's score is still damn fine and is used to serve the film right, a solid script by Michael Green that I have to say is really well balanced in tone and i'm especially happy he wrote characters motivations and emotions through conversation and not through heavy expositional scenes, performances all around being surprisingly fantastic (the best of coming from Ana de Armas as Joi and even Ryan Gosling who plays Officer K super well and in character), little but still well set up action set pieces that don't serve as distractions but help progress the plot, an amazing sense of new gadgets, change and new look to Blade Runner that made me immediately connect to the world, a romance between Officer K and Joi that I honestly have to say despite how little dialogue is shared managed to be incredibly sweet and filled with a lot of heart and made both characters so likable, and lastly from an incredible usage of sound design that lets scenes sit without music or noise to add atmosphere and tension and more importantly the all around fantastic characters and main character arc Officer K has through the story that made the film easy to forgive its story for. \n\nSo overall, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but Denis Villeneuve managed to craft not just an incredibly layered, thoughtful, and surprisingly new and fresh sequel to Blade Runner that does I think manage to hold on so well on it's own and in some respects is better than the first film (fitting it into the category of 'Films on Par with the Original', but also probably make what might be my favourite film of this year. Please Hollywood, keep letting this man do his projects for a mainstream audience because if he's serious doing a adaptation of Dune, please for the love of god let him do it. But still, a goddamn round of applause to Denis to making a competent sequel that actually managed to tell a neat albeit unnecessary sequel that is worthy of its praise.",

I know this film will be rewatched many more times and each time a new nueance will be revealed.

I could never get attached or relate to any of the characters in that movie - meaning that all the grand visuals and euphoric music couldn't make up for the fact that I simply wasn't invested in what was taking place on screen. Thankfully, in Denis Villeneuve's sequel 'Blade Runner 2049', this problem is addressed; most notably with its protagonist, Ryan Gosling's Officer K, who is actually given a character arc and undergoes massive changes by the end of the movie. It's slow, but unlike the first movie, not boring. The plot is intricate enough to sustain the running time and I was never left feeling bored. Visually the film is spectacular also; with some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. It does run a bit too long and the conclusion feels a little rushed, but I found this sequel to be superior to the original in almost every way.",
