    "summary": "The Joad clan, introduced to the world in John Steinbeck's iconic novel, is looking for a better life in California. After their drought-ridden farm is seized by the bank, the family -- led by just-paroled son Tom (Henry Fonda) -- loads up a truck and heads West. On the road, beset by hardships, the Joads meet dozens of other families making the same trek and holding onto the same dream. Once in California, however, the Joads soon realize that the promised land isn't quite what they hoped.",

            "content": "Great movie but shows a lot of suffering. It seemed a bit like communist propaganda at the time given the difference between the private farm quarters and the government quarters. I would imagine it was movies like this that made people think that Hollywood was full of communists. And interesting read to see John Steinbeck‘s real life take on the situation of the California farm, pickers or persons who picked fruit would be to read \"the harvest gypsies,\" which is some thing he wrote for a newspaper detailing the life of persons to pick fruit in California. \n\nNot a job anyone would remotely want. I believe I understand some of the dynamics of present day, California a little better after seeing this movie, and then doing a little reading from Steinbeck afterward I would highly recommend this as a movie to watch.\n\nThe real problem with the situation in California I think is that at harvest time which is a very short period of time, farms need about 20 times the labor they need the rest of the year. So they need all these temporary laborers, but what happens to the temporary laborers once the work is completed?",

            "content": "Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad captures perfectly the humanity and compassion of the Steinbeck character, an ex-con who breaks his parole conditions by joining his family in their epic journey across the southern US to a ‘better life’ in California. This is not the usual Hollywood fare. Tragedy and betrayal beset the Joad family from the outset. But it is nonetheless an uplifting movie. Spirit, compassion and tenderness mark them out. Fonda's role is particularly understated, and we see, as in Steinbeck's masterly epic, the maternally robust figure of Ma holding the family together. The performances all round are wonderful, and Ford's direction and sense of space under the big sky of the Midwest is breathtaking. This film is now largely a testament to the time in which it was set, but like the war movies that were soon to follow, a story that needed telling lest we forget.",

I cannot emphasize this enough. This is as down as you can get and still survive. We are taught to be grateful when watching this and to also consider the other guy, whoever he is and at the least, do not add to his burden. Actors are on their game as is the Director. Of course, none of this exists if it wasn't for John Steinbeck and his book. I thought about this movie during the recent Real Estate downturn and what the banks did in real life was indeed captured in this movie way back when. Indifferent, callous, and greedy while practicing their rights leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth and we bailed them out if that isn't the gall of galls. Have something to eat while watching to appreciate that you have food and the people in the movie do not, a tasty drink and a snack which is unheard of back during the depression days will help you connect more to the movie theme. There is humility, gratitude and lessons to be learned while being entertained.",

            "content": "A masterpiece, based on John Steinbeck's classic Pulitzer Prize- winning novel. Captures the desperation, hopelessness and human suffering caused by the Great Depression better than any other movie. Surely one of the saddest, most depressing, movies ever made. Director John Ford pulls no punches. Other than the direct effects of the depression, the depiction of the lengths people go to to abuse the helplessness of other humans is shocking (and very probably true). Yet, among all the cynicism, there are acts of kindness and selflessness that leave you with hope for mankind. Henry Fonda is great as Tom Joad, and deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination. Supporting cast are superb, with Jane Darwell (as Ma Joad), to the fore. Her Best Supporting Actress Oscar was well- deserved. A must-see, whether you've read the book or not. Realistic human drama at its best.",

            "content": "John Ford Connects With Modern Day Audience Through Decades-Old Film\n\nThere are a few movies that are produced that should be a must-view for the sole reason that the events portrayed should always be remembered. This is one of those films. Modern day America should never forget the suffering that took place during that desperate time and the events that forged the hardworking American people of the 1930's. Director John Ford has been able to create a work of art that allows the viewers to empathize with migrants in the Great Depression. Henry Fonda, who plays Tom Joad stars in this classic film that follows the Joad family after they get kicked off their land by the owners, as they move towards the \"promise land\" of California in search of a better life. The film portrays many different themes throughout the film such as perseverance and suffering through the pursuit of the American dream. Something the film does exceptionally well is the ability to match a small American family to what hundreds of families were experiencing at the time. Many families that initially watched this film could resonate and empathize with the Joad family story and the accurate portrayal of their story felt as if they were given a voice. A theme that can find empathizers today can be the injustice that the Joad's experienced in the working camps. A pivotal topic in today's society is the perception of injustice that people feel towards authority. So even as a modern day American, there are themes that viewers can resonate with. Visually, the temptation is to write off the film because it is in black and white but I found the lack of color brought other aspects of the film to the forefront, like recurring themes, which made me appreciate the recurring themes in the film. The film was also using technology that was modern at the time so it gives it an authentic feel. Another positive surprise for me was that the acting in the film feels genuine and authentic, which may stem from the fact that at the time of release (1940), the people involved most likely had first hand experience through their own struggles or struggles of people they knew. Overall, I would recommend this as a must watch for people to understand what the Great Depression was like and the film felt authentic to what the story was.",

            "content": "The film Grapes of Wrath was directed by John Ford, produced by Darryl Zanuck, and based on the written work of John Steinbeck.  Some key characters in the film were Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), Ma Joad (Jane Darwell), and Tom's friend Casy (John Carradine).  It was a profound film that showcased the issues of sharecroppers in Oklahoma during the dustbowl years as they faced economic ruin and were forced to flee to California based on flyers that promised work.  Unfortunately, the flyers did not convey accurate information.  The film begins with the character of Tom Joad, recently released from prison returning home only to find his family gone.  When he catches up to his family he learns that the bank has taken over most of the farms and demolished the homes of the sharecroppers.  With no land and no home, Tom and his family start out for California based on information from a flyer that promises plenty of work and with it the promise of a better life.  However, when the Joad family gets there, they find that there are more families than there are work opportunities.  They also initially find harsh conditions at the first migrant camp where they are brutally treated.  Tom sees the harsh and brutal treatment of the sharecroppers as undeserved and inhumane.  Tom's friend Casy is then killed by one of the camp security guards and Tom kills the guard in return.  While initially Tom is not discovered when the other security guards look for him and they move on to a better run government camp where he finds work, those who do not want the migrants in CA start trouble there as well.  At the end of the film Tom needs to leave as the investigation for the deceased security guard comes to the new camp.  The addition of sound to the film (new in the 1930s) really adds to the emotive concept in the film; it particularly comes across in the scene where Tom has a parting conversation with his mother conveying his concern for the families in this dire situation.  I also believe that leaving the film black and white instead of adding color adds to the grave subject matter in the film.  I was very moved by the entire film.",

            "content": "What was so great about Grapes of Wrath?\n\tJohn Ford, Nunnally Johnson and Darryl Zanuck were the soul backbones of the 1940's film \"The Grapes of Wrath.\" Oddly enough, Ford and Zanuck were adversaries to each other in the film business, they also fought in World War two together. Ford directed the famous film with Zanuck being the producer, alongside longtime screenwriter, director and playwright Nunnally Johnson. The film is headlined by lead actor Henry Fonda who plays Tom Joad, a son in the Joad family. We start the film with Tom returning from jail to his family in Oklahoma, only to encounter the family farm being taken over by the bank. The Joads, being as frustrated as they are, have a sheer desire to take it up with the people in charge. However they're unable. Luckily enough, at least in my opinion, they find some flyers seeking help in California, \"800 pickers wanted.\" The film is headlined by another massive role in Ma Joad, played by Jane Darwell. Throughout the film, Ma Joad expresses great emotion towards her family. She understands its her job to take care of the family, physically and mentally, and to keep the spirits as high as possible. Ma Joad's role over the entire film gets larger and larger. She turns into a leader over the entirety, taking over Pa Joad's role. It wasn't her job to be the leader, but as she sees the family drifting and complicated circumstances start to take over, she takes it upon herself to keep the family together at all costs. Along the road-trip, we see every characters' true emotions come to life. We see tragedy when the family arrives in Barstow, California and its revealed that Grandma Joad has passed. We see trouble when the family hears that eight-hundred pickers means possibly five-thousand flyers were printed, meaning that the Joad's may never find work in California. Another instance of trouble happens when Tom has to kill yet another person in his life after he's attacked with a club, he then turns it on the man and strikes him to death. One of the greatest aspects of this film however is Tom's character. Tom plays a lead role, but acts as such a simple player throughout the film. Every time he comes on scene the audience just expects something simple, never too much, but never giving us too little. \n\nOverall, the film does a great job of providing the audience with perspective. Through deep emotions and magnificent lead roles, were able to experience the film in the directors eyes. As John Ford takes us on a journey throughout 66, it's hard to take our eyes off of what comes next.\n8/10 recommendation",

            "content": "After the Great Depression, the righteous son decided to lead the people in revolt. On the night of parting, his mother asked where to find him. He replied, \"Where the poor struggle to eat, there will be me; Where there is a policeman beating the poor, there is me; I'm among the angry shouts, I'm among the children laughing at the smell of supper...\" .\nAs soon as the film was released, capitalists panicked and states scrambled to ban it. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the bloody suppression of the Black Panther Party, and the exporting of the values of the rich and powerful in Hollywood transformed \"Black Panther\" from a term that practically led the Black revolution into a high-tech, tight-suited mashing clown in the Marvel universe. Would such a film be made in America today? This is a question worthy of our deep reflection. The films that can cause people's reflection are never famous, but those meaningless Hollywood science fiction films are most sought after by people. The tone of the film is sad and sullen. Although some of the plot or humor, or calm, but can not hide its sadness. At the same time, it has a glimmer of light, leading the audience to expect and imagine the people's rise and struggle. The protagonist Joad is brave and has a fighting spirit. Even as the family flees west, some of the characters leave one by one. But the image of the poor and simple farmer who never gives up is deeply rooted in people's hearts, which is thought-provoking and touching. It can be said that under the harsh environment and arduous tribulations, it also shows a positive and positive transmission to the audience. By means of satire, the film exposed and criticized the darkness and suffering of the society at that time from all angles, and truly criticized the evil capitalism at that time. Throughout the film, it is able to trigger tears, empathy, anger and deep shock.\nIn today's society, those who dare to speak the truth will be spurned, The Grapes of Wrath really taught me a lesson.

            "content": "Grapes of Wrath was a 1940's cinema film directed by John Ford, produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, written by Nunnally Johnson, and based on the book by John Steinbeck. Henry Fonda was cast as the lead role at the height of his career which gave a large pull to audiences through star power. The story follows Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) and his family as they move to California after being forced off their farm during the great depression and dustbowl where they seek out jobs for fair wages to create a life for themselves, but at every turn, something seems to go wrong. Tom Joad and Jim Casey become fast friends while this black and white film had great shots to foreshadow events, such as the lighting and windstorm near the beginning with the preacher before they head to the farm. This movie was made to give a more realistic representation of the struggle of individuals/families the treatment of workers during this time and the labor practiced that was already used during the building of the transcontinental railroad where all the money they earned working went straight back because of the cost of food, clothing, etc. so they remained poor. This film also represented the political activist movement to stop the exploitation of migrant workers how Tom Joad tries to write to earn fair wages but is accused of communism by a police officer. \n\nThis was inspired by Jim Casey (John Carradine) who works to organize the workers.  The film was a great medium for messages to the public because people could see the hardships and empathize with the characters. I highly recommend this movie as an overview of life after the stock market crash and the effects of the great depression. The struggles the family goes through while trying to seek a better life and survive while being ousted by communities where migrant workers tried to settle because they were trying to take jobs from them. In conclusion Grapes of Wrath was an instant classic movie and came at a time when it was most needed to help society deal with the unfair treatment of workers. It also competed against the mainstream entertainment of radio shows, and mafia movies and was something new to cinematography which shows the impact of the film on society with how successful it was. This film adaptation of John Steinbeck's book was done brilliantly and the casting for it worked out rather well with just enough big names to bring people to the movies.",

            "content": "Should The Grapes of Wrath been left at a novel?\n\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, was directed by John Ford and was eventually released to the public in 1940. Darryl Zanuck was the man who produced this film starring Henry Fonda, a big name in the industry. \n\nThe film starts with Tom Joad coming home from prison to his father's 40-acre farm to meet Casy, a man who was previously a preacher. They arrive home to find out the Joads had been forced from their home and had started for California with the rest of the farmers. These farmers had been forced to move by the dustbowl, a significant dust storm that plagued the southern plains in the 1930s. Many farmers chose to seek a better life in California in an attempt to run from the dust bowl and the great depression that clouded the nation. Tom finds this out by talking to Muley, a shaky man who doesn't want to leave his home. Tom brings Casy and reconnects with his large family to start their trip to California. The Joads make it to a refugee camp and earn minimal pay for their physical labor. A strike breaks out in the camp, leaving Casy dead and Tom with blood on his hands, so the Joads pack up and move again. This time coming across a better government camp with better provisions for the family. When the cops eventually come looking for Tom, he is forced to flee and say goodbye to his mother, who kisses him on the cheek as she weeps for her son. \n\nThe film has an overall slow pacing as it works through the story of the Joads family. The dustbowl might have been the cause of the family's move, but the great depression causes the root of the hardships throughout the movie. This makes the film applicable to American troubles today because many parts of the US are still poverty-stricken. Some US cities have neighborhoods that are relatable to third-world countries. Throughout all this, the family can keep a positive outlook on their situation because they see the light at the end of the tunnel in California. I believe the film does a great job of storytelling, which is helped by the fact that it is based on a novel. The actors had good performances that allow you to feel the pain they are going through, and Tom Joad's continuous positivity is admirable. I would recommend this film to an older audience that would enjoy the slow pace. It could also be more relatable for them if they had close relatives who lived through these times. \n\nTo end, I think the movie is an American classic that is a good view into the past of our nation. It allows for thoughtful analysis and makes for a good watch if you have the time.",

Henry Fonda is excellent as Tom Joad, a former convict who, by film's end, becomes obsessed with social justice, as evident in the emotional speech to his mother prior to his departure.

This is a story firmly based in people, humanity, and community, following the Joad family as they are displaced from their home in Oklahoma and journey to the promised bountiful lands of California. Their struggles to find work, to go on in extreme hunger, deal with travel, and persevere is not distinctly American, but Ford's script and use of imagery makes it so.\nTom Joad, portrayed by Henry Fonda, is the film's hero and possesses many attributes that would become archetypal to the classic Western leads of film. Fonda does an immensely commendable job leading the film and carries an energy through the lens that embodies old Hollywood stardom. He leads an equally adept cast, yet remains the standout – perhaps because he is given the most meaty scenes and dialogue. Through heartbreak, loss, and tragedy, the Joads continue on in their great journey West. This story, though fictional, is all too common to resonate in any impacted by the Great Depression or similar economic situations that would follow it. Taking place many years ago, we can see how and when structures were put in place that still put many families in positions like that of the Joads today. Ford creates a melancholy tone of mourning the America that died in this era, while highlighting the common people who worked to endure it and banded together as a community through their exploitation. \nPerhaps one of the most significant scenes comes at the diner when Grandpa takes the children inside to buy what little bread the family can afford (not even a full loaf). The waitress, refuses to sell the bread and says they must purchase a sandwich. Grandpa humbly explains how their budget cannot afford such luxuries and the man behind the counter insists she sell them the loaf for all they can pay. Whilst paying for the loaf, Grandpa asks if that is penny candy for sale – to which the waitress replies that it is two for a penny. He purchases the candy for the two children and goes on his way. Two truck drivers who have been eating and witness the whole interaction recognize that the waitress lied about the price and leave her the difference so that she was not at a loss. Perfectly scripted, paced, and shot, this scene embodies the spirit of the film and original novel – to find kindness and empathy for one another in such trying times. It is this sentiment that makes the working class the heroes of the film and the era.",

This film begins in Oklahoma better known in the 1930's as the \"Dust Bowl\". The story is of a family that has to leave their long time home due to their not being able to cultivate the land any longer and the land being taken over by a new owner. Despite the sadness that surrounds the family they are also in a sense optimistic as to what is to come when they venture to California. The family is under the belief there will be endless opportunity available to them but getting there proves to be detrimental and taxing. \nMy take on this movie is that it is filled with moments of highs and lows these highs and lows will keep you enthralled throughout the 2 hours you are watching the film. You will form a connection with the main characters as they attempt to find the promise of opportunity in route to California. There are moments where you will be gripped with anger on behalf of the characters because unbeknownst to yourself you will become invested with characters like Casey played by John Carradine and and Tom Joad played by Henry Fonda. Jane Darwell (plays Ma Joad) delivers moments of compassion and worry for her family that will cause you to want to root for the family to succeed during their passage and time in California. \nIf you are looking for a film that is based on American history this film is for you. The film will take you through moments that occurred for people that lived in Oklahoma during the 1930's. You will understand the mix of desperation to ride out the hardship that has befallen the many farmers and not want to let go of land that was pass down generationally. You will also see the determination of a family to seek opportunity as far away as California. The willingness to work for what at the time was a minuscule amount to ensure the family continued to prosper together. This movie will leave you wanting more a sequel so to speak to see what else occurs and comes of the main characters.",

It is starred by Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell and John Carradine, directed by John Ford, and written and produced by Nunnally Johnson and Darryl F Zanuck.\n\nTom Joad, played by Henry Fonda, has just come out of prison. When he returns home, he finds that his home is empty. Later, I learned from Jim Casy, played by John Carradine, that local farmers were forced to leave the land due to industrial development. The two of them and their families are also going to leave their hometown and go to California to find a new job. Unfortunately, on the way, his elderly grandparents died one after another, and Casy was killed. Joad was chased after avenging his friend Casy and had to flee with his family.\n\nAs an excellent director, John Ford vividly shows the scene of farmers going bankrupt and fleeing during the economic panic of the 1930s in the United States that this film needs to show. It deeply reflects the sufferings of the peasants at that time under the persecution of capitalism! It also reflected the turbulence of the social situation in the United States at that time. And the farmers' reluctance to grow up, work, and accompany their land all their lives in the film also makes me empathize. In China, there is an idiom called falling leaves returning to their roots, which means that people hope to return to their hometown when they die or after. The peasants who were expelled in the film died and escaped. I think that as a record of the significance of the westward movement of the United States, the film is very valuable for preserving the pain of every people during the economic depression!",

            "content": "A powerful melodrama about struggling for survival during The Great Depression, The Grapes Of Wrath is anchored by a lead performance from Henry Fonda that many still regard as his finest. The supporting plays are great too, and the black and white cinematography emphasises the bleak and desolate wastelands the characters are living in, and the hopelessness of the circumstances they're constantly trapped by. The film often leans too hard into sentimentality, and the runtime is excessive, making it difficult to always give your full attention to. But what the film does well, and what it's so beloved for, is it's honest, uncompromising portrayal of the rural folks who were driven from their homes and lived in abject poverty for so many years. Much effort has been made to show the conditions of The Great Depression as realistically as possible. We see people in ragged clothing, baring dirty faces, standing round a cooking pot hoping for the smallest scrap of food. But along with showing the horrors people had to endure, it also demonstrates mankind's incredible capacity for charity and compassion, even in the darkest of moments. It's not a film I'd rewatch in a hurry, but for its acting, authenticity and message of optimism even when all seems lost, I'm glad I seen it once.",

            "content": "The Dust Bowl period and the Great Depression affected millions of Americans during the decade of 1930, forcing them to leave their houses and move to other states searching desperately for low-paid jobs for feeding their families every day, the Joad family is not an exception.  \n\nThe Joad family is a farmer household from Oklahoma expelled from their land because of the drought of the Dust Bowl. On their trip to California, they will see how the crisis affected families from all over America and that is not going to be that easy to find a job as they thought.  \n\nDespite the simplicity of the plot, the director John Ford and the producer Darryl F. Zanuck made an excellent job adapting the novel written by John Steinbeck to the big screen. He managed to make me feel the same way as the characters did thanks to the appropriate choice of actors. Henry Foda perfectly suited the role of Tom Joad, a strong character who cares about his family, but the words of Jane Darwell as Ma Joad touched my heart, especially the last speech she gives to Tom before he leaves.  \n\nDorris Bowdon, who interpreted Rose of Sharon, was one of the less experienced performers and she did an excellent job, her face and body expressions were natural, and the acting of Charley Grapewin, grandpa Joad, was spectacular especially at the beginning of the film when he shows his love for his land until the point he wants to stay there forever. \n\nHowever, the course of the film was heavy and everything but dynamic as instead of being one single movie, it looked like small shorts put all together with weak connections, for example, the borders between each state. Moreover, the beginning of the film did not hook me and it was not until the police intervention in the first camp when I started to feel a real interest in the film. \n\nFinally, the visual production was shocking, innovative, and vanguardist. The camera was used as another way of expressing instead of having just a narrative function, for example, when the tractors brought down the houses of the farmers, the camera shows us the shadow of the people on the tracks of the tractors as if they had brought down their lives too. This was joined by the great and adequate soundtrack that boosted the sensations transmitted.  \n\nOverall, I think is worth seeing this movie so I recommend it to everybody, especially to history enthusiasts. The realistic reflection of the old American people along with the amazing shots makes The Grapes of Wrath a unique film.",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath is a 1940 film based on the novel by John Steinbeck. The film was directed by John Ford and the screenplay was written by Nunnally Johnson, who also served as a producer alongside Darryl F. Zanuck. The film stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, and John Carradine as Jim Casey. The film takes place in the 1930s during the Dust Bowl crisis in the southern United States and follows the Joad family after they lose their farm and decide to travel west to California in search of work. \n            Although The Grapes of Wrath is a black and white film, it is a masterpiece of its time and worth watching. Cinematographer Gregg Toland does an excellent job making lighting decisions to match the mood of each scene. Additionally, the film editor, Robert L. Simpson, makes some very interesting editing choices including the decision to blend certain shots together to evoke transitions.    \n            Overall, I highly recommend this film because of its masterful ability to convey a timeless message through a historically significant lens. This film clearly evokes the harsh reality of the time, but the eternal resilience of the Joad family as they encounter obstacle after obstacle sends a message of hope and optimism that is applicable to audiences of any generation. Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad is particularly noteworthy; Fonda's commitment and attention to detail render his character extremely believable and relatable. His character seems to represent the Everyman; he starts the film at a literal crossroads, a corner store called \"Cross Roads\", after his release from prison. No matter how hard Joad tries to stay out of trouble, he cannot help but fight for justice, a tough fight when the opposition is society itself. Additionally, Jane Darwell's performance as Ma Joad is thoughtful and moving. As the matriarch of the family, Darwell's character holds the family together. In one memorable scene, Ma Joad burns the possessions she will no longer need before setting out for California. She holds a pair of earrings up to her face for a long moment before hastily stuffing them in her pocket, hopeful that she may have the chance to wear them again one day. \n\tThe Grapes of Wrath is a rare film because of its ability to transcend time and resonate with viewers from the 1940s until the present. The film preserves the historical landscape and social context of the 1930s, while presenting characters who face the hard times and tough choices that face all generations in some form. The Joad family represents all families and, no matter how tough the circumstances, they always persevere.",

It just breaks the mood.\nThe cast however is fantastic with Henry Fonda starring as Tom with a host of brilliant supporting actors taking on other roles. I think special mention must got to Jane Darwell as Ma Joad who is the rock of the family and perhaps, more than the others, manages to show the real dignity of the people who found themselves in this terrible situation.

This movie and book depict a time in our history a time in our history when families were moving west looking for a better life for themselves and their futures. Our main character Tom Joad ( Henry Fonda) has been paroled for a fight he engaged in resulting in a killing 4 years earlier back home in Oklahoma , but his family is being forced off their family farm by big banks and investors so they decide to move west to California like most families at this time. When I look at some of the themes of this movie I can see some resemblance to the 2008 meltdown with the banks and the mortgage crisis. People were forced out of their homes because of bad lending practices but the banks lived to fight another day with the bail out from the federal government.  Tom Joad was just one story of many of how important having unions are when you have to fight huge corporations. When people with the same goal and like aspirations band together they are able to fight these huge corporations as one. The journey of the Joad family from Oklahoma to California due to the dust bowl ,wiping out farms and corporation buy outs think California is going to answer all their prayers. What they will find when they reach California , just like the millions of other families had the same idea to move west, the opportunities are not as plentiful as they think. They arrive and find they're not wanted and are relocated to a town for all the migrants arriving from the mid-west. Within this town there able to find work but the work is tied to them filling in for workers who have walked off the job. From this they are able to come together form a union and fight for the rights of all workers against landowners.  This movie gave some insight on a part of American history about the great migration from the Midwest to California and how difficult it was for families to move their entire family across the country in search of a better life",

He finds former preacher Jim Casey, played by John Caradine, who inform him that his family was forced to move due to the damaged caused by the dust bowl.

The Joad family is large, including Ma Joad, played by Jane Darwell, Grandpa, played by Charley Grapewin, and many others.

I don't frequently watch black and white film, and when I do its often just Christmas movies. After watching the film, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was fascinating to learn more about a time long past. When the Grapes of Wrath was released, the Dust Bowl was a recent tragedy, fresh in the mind of those who had struggled through it. But now, the vast majority of those who lived through the Dust Bowl have passed on. The Grapes of Wrath helps bring a face to this tragic area of history. The film does an excellent job capturing the length and difficulty of the Joad's journey. The portrayal of the Joad's vehicle helped emphasize how difficult their journey was. Throughout the movie, the vehicle looked ready to collapse but still kept going. At points, it would look like it was about to tip, but barely stays upright. I felt that this really helped show how overburdened the Joad's vehicle was. The film helps emphasize the distance of the trip with shots showing large swaths of the rugged southwest countryside. Seeing how small the vehicle was in comparison to the land helped highlights the enormity of the trip.\n\nAnother key aspect of the Grapes of Wrath is it's look into worker's rights issues that were prominent at the time. The film takes a strong stance in support of worker's rights. This is an issue that was very personal to the cast of this film. I imagine that having the opportunity to be a part of this commentary was very motivational to the cast, and helped lead to the amazing performances found in this film. \n\nI would highly recommend you watch the Grapes of Wrath, even if you don't regularly watch black and white films. I felt very attached to the Joad family during their trip, and had a glimpse into a time long past.",

Jane Darwell also won an Oscar for her role in The Grapes of Wrath, for best supporting actress. However, the main character of the film is Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda. Tom Joad's role in this movie is to fight for change when it comes to social justice. \n\nThe film begins with Tom Joad being released from prison making his way back to his family and home town in Oklahoma.

The Joan family have decided to migrate to California because they have heard that there is work there. However, the the grandparents of the Joad family become extremely ill resulting in the grandfathers death on the road to California, and the grandmother passing away once they arrive in California. This is definitely a huge part of the film because it expresses the lack of health care during the Great Depression. Once the Joad's arrive in California at a migrant camp, it is nothing what they expected it to be. They make their journey to different migrant camps just to run into more trouble. However, Tom actually finds work and is inspired to keep fighting for social justice.

I've never really watched a film like this before which made me truly realize how much society has changed. However, many of the obstacles the Joad family faced, many Americans are still currently facing those same problems. I believe that John Ford was an incredible director. Even though we are much more technologically advanced in the film industry now, I had to adjust to a different era of film.

Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell give some of the greatest performances I have ever seen as they express all of the internal pain of their characters through facial expressions and small gestures, they're better than almost any actor working today and 79 years later they still appear brilliant. I felt a deep sadness and compassion for those who faced this historical tragedy with absolutely no support and this film explains why social change was needed in the United States during this time period better than almost any social issues focused picture.\n\nThe Joad family, led by adult son Tom Joad, Henry Fonda, and Ma Joad, Jane Darwell, are forced to leave their family farm in Oklahoma and travel to California as a result of the Dust Bowl. They face a grueling journey along Route 66 as they are following thousands of other Okies and Arkies with the same problems and experience the deaths of the oldest members of their families. They find respite at a camp but this may not be enough as it implied that the camp is communist based and when preacher Jim Casy, John Carradine, a family friend who has joined them on their journey, comes into conflict with the police there are disastrous consequences.\n\nThis film takes a large scale tragedy that hurt so many people and caused major social upheaval and tells this story through the lives of a few ordinary, well written characters whose lives are irreparably changed by the Dust Bowl. The supportive, unflappable matriarch and the flawed but hopeful son are common archetypes in film but here they feel real and fleshed out because we spend time with them and see in their everyday interactions who they really are. It helps that director John Ford is an expert at capturing little moments in people's lives that are more revealing than any big, emotional scene. I was connected to this family and desperate to see them prosper despite their circumstances.\n\nHow Fonda's performance didn't earn him the Academy Award for Best Actor I don't understand, obviously the Academy get more wrong that right but this is one of the best performances by an actor I have ever seen. The complex emotions that pass over his faces even if only for a short moment reach out and pull you into his story as he is the emotional center of the film. Darwell was rewarded for her performance with the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award and the quiet strength and morose commitment that she displays will forever be in my mind. I was invested in Tom and Ma Joad because Darwell and Fonda made them feel so fully realized and I held on to them even as the film's credits played and the illusion was broken.\n\nJohn Ford primarily worked as a director of Westerns, a genre that I'm not particularly fond of, and although I've seen The Searchers (1956) and Stagecoach (1939) I would call this my favorite of the films he has directed. He has such a clear vision for the film as we get classic Ford shots that capture the landscape and scenery that have made these people's lives so rough. Ford is gifted with a great screenplay from Nunnally Johnson that brings the story and characters to life better than in say My Darling Clementine (1946). Ford deserves to be considered one of the greatest directors of all time even if only for this film because it is such a marvel of cinematic excellence.\n\nI would rank this highly if I were ever to create a Top 100 Films list and I think it deserves to have a large audience not just because of it's importance but because it is a well made, genuinely moving film that is a testament to the power of film in it's ability to express the anguish of a whole generation.",

It was written by Nunnally Johnson; based on the novel ï¿ 1/2~The Grapes of Wrathï¿ 1/2(TM) by John Steinbeck. Darryl Zanuck and Nunnally Johnson produced it. It first aired in 1940. The film ï¿ 1/2~Grapes of Wrathï¿ 1/2(TM) starts off with a man by the name of Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda, walking down a long road in Oklahoma during the Great Depression. He seeks a ride from a truckdriver at a local gas station, trying to get home to his family. Tom Joad was just released from prison before the movie begins. After finding a truck driver willing to give him a ride, he stops at a dirt road off of the highway and continues by foot until he runs into a preacher he knew growing up. The preacher named Jim Casy, played by John Carradine, tells Tom that he is no longer a preacher and that a lot has changed since he went away to prison. They continue on towards Tomï¿ 1/2(TM)s family home where they discover that no one is home, and that the whole family already left to Uncle Johns house due to the banks repossessing all the farms in the area. Families that have lived and worked on the land for years were for the first time in generations being told they have to leave and have nowhere to go. Tom invites Jim to join him on the trip to his Uncles house. When they arrive, the family is shocked and very happy to see Tom come home. They explain the situation is the same at Uncle Johnï¿ 1/2(TM)s house, and that they have to be out very soon. The family saved up to purchase a car, and hopefully enough money to get them food for their trip to California where they have been told by fliers that there is ample work there. The family packs up the car and makes the long trip from Oklahoma to California. During the trip from Oklahoma to California both grandparents pass away as it is simply too hard on them. Pa Joad, played by Russell Simpson, organizes the trip and tries to get food and candies for the little ones, but the trip and experience is very hard on him. Ma Joad, played by Jane Darwell, is a strong support for the family as she keeps moral up as best as she can. \n\nAs the family makes a several stops to camp out on their way to California they meet up other families doing the same. One night at one of the campgrounds, Pa Joad learns that the flier he got stating there enough jobs for 800 people was sent out to thousands of people. The traveler that tells him this explains that is because the owner of the land is trying to get extremely cheap labor, and by having thousands show up, he can offer an unreasonably low pay; assuming the most desperate will still accept the work. This discussion ends in an argument, and the Joad family decides to ignore the manï¿ 1/2(TM)s story. The Joads continue traveling until they reach a farm looking for work with a campgrounds of other Oklahoma folk living out of their cars and tents with entire families. As they enter they get an odd feeling about the owners and the local police. People are treating extremely poorly, and offered horrible pay for picking fruit. Some of the people protest and want to organize a strike. One evening Tom goes for a walk after dinner, only to find Jim talking to other people under a bridge. They are discussing organizing a strike in large numbers demanding better pay. Just as they are discussing this, the local police, whom have forbid the ï¿ 1/2~Oakiesï¿ 1/2(TM) from walking around after dark, attack the group of men. During the struggle one of the cops kill Jim. This angers Tom, who retaliates by killing one of the police officers. Tom gets injured in this altercation and knows he must flee. He goes back to the cabin where his family is sleeping and plans on leaving in the middle of the night before his Ma convinces him that they will all sneak out together and find better work elsewhere.\nCONT...",

The setting of the movie takes place in Oklahoma City and throughout the movie shifts to California.  The main character in the movie is Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda, who is released from the penitentiary and looking forward to seeing his family after four years of being away.  To his surprise, he learns that his parents, Ma and Pa Joad, along with other family members and neighbors, were forced to leave the homes they had lived and farmed over 50 years by wealthy bank owners.  When Tom reunites with his family, he further learns about a handbill soliciting Pickers in California.  The story line is about the family's journey from Oklahoma to California and the arduous challenges they encounter throughout their travels.  Yet, in their quest to reach what they envisioned as 'The Promise Land and The Land of Milk and Honey', they set out with high hopes and the prospect of turning around their dreaded fate in Oklahoma City for beautiful and luscious lands in California.  In addition to challenging, the travels of the Joad family and others migrating to California proved to be fatal.  Notwithstanding, they maintained their faith and prospect of securing full time employment upon arrival.  Adversity was short-term in their minds.  However, little did they know that they would find that 'The Promise Land and The Land of Milk and Honey' which they envisioned would be threatened by the socialites and people in power in California.  The Joad Family wanted to work and earn an earnest living.  Yet, despite their well-intentions to be great citizens, they experienced difficulties finding work, putting food on the table, and pursuing a little piece of the American dream because they were not welcomed nor wanted in the migrant-filled state of California.  Great film which one a Pulitzer-Prize.  Appropriate for all family members to watch.  Film is black and white.  Very simple to follow and understand movie.  Difficult at times to watch the challenges of this family and migrant friends.  It is a humbling experience we can all learn from which occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Highly recommend spending the $3.99 to view this great movie.",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful screen adaption of John Steinbeck's 1938 widely-acclaimed novel of the same name. The drama is set in the midwest during the Great Depression which showcases the livelihood of the Joad family as they face homelessness, unemployment, and starvation.  The hopelessness of their situation being a predominant theme throughout the film. The movie focuses on the perspective of our protagonist, Tom Joad, and how he and his family survived misfortunes caused by the Dust Bowl. Their home was taken away  as the bank repossesses their land, their only choice being to get in their truck and cross the desert for hope. Living through the Great Depression the family couldn't avoid the natural disaster by investing into any industrial equipment to keep their land and they were forced to abandon their land/business. The film captures the family's agonizing uncertainty while they look for hope in California. It wasn't the only family looking for hope though, reason why jobs and food were limited. The people in California did not welcome the migrants and they called them the \"Okies\". They were put in camps and starved. One camp, \"Hoovervilles\" named after the President who many considered the one responsible for causing the Great depression. This movie takes a closer look on the reality lived during the Great Depression. Tom Joad is portrayed by Henry Fonda whose performance was nominated for an Oscar. The movie was directed by John Ford and produced by Darryl. F Zanuck, while screenplay was written by Nunnally Johnson that focused on the whole journey of the Joad family. To sum up I highly recommend this movie because it is the closest we can go to relate to the people living through the Great Depression. The film captures the family's sorrow and the agonizing uncertainty endured along their journey in search for opportunity in the west. While the family was searching for hope in California some members of the family die off or left on the way, while Ma Joad tries really hard to keep the family together. On the other hand, Tom begins to perceive a new vision for humanity.",

From there, they head back home to Oklahoma to find their farm overrun by tractors and bought out by large banks.  After coming home to this disaster, Tom, his family, and Casey decide to head west for California in hopes of a better life.  Unfortunately, they only have one vehicle so all twelve of them pack in for the trip.  Along the way, before arriving in Texas, Tomï¿ 1/2(TM)s grandpa has a stroke and dies.  Once in Texas, their car breaks down and needs a new engine.  After getting the car fixed for a cheap price, they continue on their journey.  They made a pit stop in Arizona where Noah, Tomï¿ 1/2(TM)s brother stays behind, shortly afterward Tomï¿ 1/2(TM)s grandma dies as well.  With heart break from leaving his brother and his grandmas passing, they continue onward toward California.  Once in the ï¿ 1/2prosperousï¿ 1/2Â? state in a town called Hooverville, Connie, Tomï¿ 1/2(TM)s brother-in-law, runs away.  Tom believes the town is not safe, so he and his family move onward to Weedpatch, a place heard to have work.  Once there, Tom is the only one who could find a job which was digging ditches, shortly afterward they all migrate to Hooper Ranch due to the lack of work available for everyone.  Upon arrival, Tom unities with Casey, only for a short while until he was killed which caused Tom to kill a man.  In suspicion of Tom getting arrested, they again leave Hooper Ranch to go to a place for workers to pick cotton.  That too only last a short time due to Ruthie accidentally telling someone Tom killed a man.  Tom then leaves but assures everyone that he will continue Caseyï¿ 1/2(TM)s dynasty in creating unions and bettering the conditions for workers.  Toward the end of the story, the family ends up leaving the cotton-picking sanctuary aside from Al and his new wife Agnes.  Upon their departure, they come across a barn with a son and dying father with an illness.  Rosa Sharon breast feeds the man until he recovers from the illness and recovers well from the treatment. \n\n\nProduction highlights (positive or negative):\n\nThe overall message is trying to shine a light on migrant workers, work conditions, and unjustified low wage pay.  The really cool part about this story is that it was written in the 1930ï¿ 1/2(TM)s but still stands true today, especially in regard to the unjustly low wage pay. \n\n\nOverall Recommendation:\n\nIt is an absolute classic however, I would not recommend unless you have time to spare or you work in the art/film industry. \n\n\nConclusion: \n\n Great story, great message, I could have lived without seeing this movie due to the fact that my work or personal life does not evolve around art or film at all.",

There was not a moment in which the standard lagged, and this made watching the movie a pleasant experience in which one could take the directing for granted, and therein be more attentive to the storyline. Additionally, the cinematography aided in conceptual aspects of the film. Moments such as the opening gesture of the movie sparked my interest, in that it showed, with much purpose, the vast and barren landscape with man coming out of it to greet man. This moment, as well as several others, provided one with the sense that nature was empowered and man was living in its domain, rather than the opposite.\n\nFor the most part, I found comfort in Nunnally Johnson's writing. I enjoyed the pauses taken to provide moments of solace, in story and reflection. Additionally, I enjoyed the contrasting short revealing bursts of information, such as when Tom Joad, played by Henry Fonda, departed the bus and stated simply \"Homicide.\" I found this to provide a comfortable balance between tender and informative moments.\n\nI found acting in a multitude of secondary roles to be both dispassionate and unintentional. In these instances, this disapassion was accompanied by the kind of presentational acting that was prevalent in this era. I had trouble overall finding a real effort being put into accents. \n\nI found much comfort in the acting of Henry Fonda. He possessed a great presence, due to his very thoughtful and intentional acting. What I found to be really spectacular, especially for this era, was the fluidity and organic quality in his motions and speech. His unique and consistent body language made for a cohesive performance that I was very pleased with.\n\nI was very surprised by how gripping this movie was, due to Henry Fonda's exceptional acting and the work of John Ford and Darryl Zanuck.

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath is a film from 1940 directed by John Ford, written by Nunnally Johnson, starring Henry Fonda, and based on the novel written by John Steinbeck. The Grapes of Wrath is an emotional film focusing on the Joad family, a family of farmers moving out west to California from Oklahoma. The Joad family is pictured trying to make an honest living in the hard-economic times for many, especially farmers. The story gives insight to the struggles many people had to go through to make a small living and the unfairness they met from employers and those with power including law enforcement. Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad the main protagonist. His performance was inspiring. Henry Fonda perfected his role and you could feel his emotion throughout the whole movie. Each of the tough decisions that Tom Joad had to make felt like they had real weight thanks to Henry Fonda. The film gives a mature outlook to the battles of good vs evil/corruption, some of which we still see in our country today. The Grapes of Wrath really caused me to take a step back to appreciate the laws and regulations we have in place for our work force today. While there are still injustices some experience in today, The Grapes of Wrath helps you to remember there are always those willing to fight and do what is right no matter the cost. My biggest critic for the film is that during times of sadness, loss, or death it wasn't as profound as it could have been. I felt it was under played at a times where some films can go overboard. In conclusion, this isn't a typical film that I would normally watch, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. I can see why this film has earned the praise of many critics and audiences. For a film created in such early times it is impressive that they were able to create a film that is still relevant today. While I don't see myself watching this film again or recommending this film to people as a highly entertaining film. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting more insight to the history of depression or anyone looking for the very best of American classic film.",

            "content": "In \"The Grapes of Wrath\", the 1940's film adaption of Steinbeck's classic novel, director John Ford tragically illustrates the dissolution of the American dream of Western settlement amidst the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. The story centers around Tom Joad, who returns from jail after four years on parole, only to find his parent's house abandoned due to unrelenting dust storms. Tom reunites with his family at his Uncle John's house, but the group is soon evicted from their farm by the land owners. \n\nThe rest of the film chronicles the journey of the Joad's, an eight person family of sharecroppers, who are now forced to travel west. The family sets their eyes towards California, urged on by labor pamphlets which promise thousands of well paying agricultural jobs to those willing to make the trek. With all of their belongings packed into the family truck, the Joad's and former town preacher Jim Casey head westward in search of a new life. Along the road, the family faces heart-wrenching circumstances that faithfully depict the struggles of the rural poor during the 1930's. \n\nFrom a directorial standpoint, Ford excels in capturing the spirit of the downtrodden American settler. Working alongside cinematographer Gregg Toland, Ford employs a variety of wide-lens landscape shots to convey the scale and gravity of the midwestern plains. In doing so, Toland and Ford create a visual backdrop that begins to symbolize the burden of the rural poor. As the plot develops, the inhospitable country serves to reinforce the severity of their working class struggle. Throughout the film, Toland utilizes low lighting to add to the depressing tone of the movie. During night scenes, Toland employs candle like lighting to envelop the actor's faces in shadow. As a result, the family's circumstances feel more tragic during dialogue. Pinned against such dark and overwhelming visuals, the Joad's feel especially helpless in their quest for California. \n\nThe movie was produced by Darryl Zanuck of Twentieth Century Fox, whose prior films at Warner Brothers often depicted the struggle of the working class during the Great Depression. Nunnally Johnson's well adapted script serves as a homage to the resilience of the everyday man, despite some minor alterations to the language from Steinbeckï¿ 1/2(TM)s novel. Johnson's script is brought to life by moving performances from Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, John Carradine and Charley Grapewin. \n\nServing as the film's lead, Henry Fonda does an excellent job depicting Tom Joad's transformation from a headstrong ex-convict to a man overwhelmed by the reality of his living situation. By the end of the film, Tom Joad leaves his family behind to fight against the injustice he perceives in the world around him. Fonda's careful attention to dialogue allows the viewer to fully invest in Tom Joad's character as a victim of his time and an eventual symbolic hero of the working class. Fonda's final speech serves is a poetically delivered homage to the resilience of the common man.\n\nAdditionally, Jane Darwell shines as Ma Joad, the family matriarch. A personal highlight of the film is Ma Joad's final goodbye to the family house, as Darwill silently but expressively portrays the sadness of leaving her former life behind. Furthermore, Darwell's final speech serves as a perfect conclusion to an otherwise gloomy film, as Ma Joad reasserts the resilience of the working class despite the crushing circumstances they face. John Carradine charismatically portrays John Casey, the former town preacher, who has lost his faith at the beginning of the movie. As the plot unfolds, Carradine glows as a glimmer of hope and redemption amidst the darkness around him, aided tremendously by his expressive acting.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this film as a poetic commendation to the working class spirit. The film is at often times tragic, but the conclusion of Ford's movie will leave attentive viewers inspired. Modern viewers may be bored by the film's slower pacing, but I believe those willing to give the film a full viewing will be more than rewarded. Viewers may benefit from some prior  contextual knowledge regarding the dustbowl to augment the reality of the Joad's situation, but the film certainly holds its own without this. The Grapes of Wrath holds up as a classic homage to the downtrodden after all these years.",

This movie is centered around the Joad family, who lost their house to the bank and embark on a journey for a better life. They set out to California, where they hear there are ample job opportunities. Along the way they endure many hardships such as: deaths, fights and having to constantly steer clear of the police. Once they arrive in California, a better future is the last thing they will find. However, through everything they stick together and support each other, which makes it clear to readers that the importance of family is one of the main themes of this film.\n\n The characters in the movie are played brilliantly. We have Tom Joad, who is introduced first in the movie. He was recently released from jail (after four years) and joins his family just in time as they go to California. Through his time in jail, he has adopted a different mindset where he focuses on the present moment. We also have Ma Joad, who is extremely strong and able to face any problem head on and Pa Joad, who is a bit weaker than his wife. He is constantly looking up to her for solutions to the many problems the family struggles with throughout the film. Two other important key players are Jim Casey, a former preacher, and Rose of Sharon.  She is Ma and Paï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s oldest daughter and ends up being left behind by her husband and giving birth to a dead baby. \n\nIn some of the best shots of the movie, the audience gets to see how terrible these natives live. The dry dusty land, dilapidated houses, disgusting camps and terrified faces all help to paint a picture of pain and misery.  The camera captures the pure turmoil and fear in the characterï¿ 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s eyes, which is very effective in showing the audience how hard it was to survive through this. I would describe the film as very convincing. The director definitely got across the message he wished the audience receive. I can say, that one will better understand the importance of family and lifting each other up after seeing this movie. The depiction of real-life fear and feelings are still prominent today, especially the element of social injustice by police officers. This movie, although it has a little bit of comic relief, is mostly meant for people to understand that people not only had to live through this, but that they barely survived.",

When characters would talk between each other for a regular conversation, you felt like you were there. You could hear the happiness in their voices and the genuine sadness and hopelessness that the Joad family experienced. Henry Fonda as Tommy, Jane Darwell as Ma, and Russell Simpson as Pa, along with the rest of the cast, all did an incredible job at portraying the struggles, hopes, and disappointments of the Joad family. Their acting, combined with the directing, sets, and sound effects made the viewer empathize with the family on screen. In 1940, America was just coming out of the Great Depression. This film related the book, the Grapes of Wrath, to what the American people were feeling. During the Great Depression, families were homeless, had a hard time feeding their families, and couldnï¿ 1/2(TM)t find jobs. This film became relatable. The Joads were forced out of their home they had known for so long and went to California in hopes to find reliable work. Through the film you see the family struggle, have hope, and get disappointed. In the end, the viewer feels somewhat hopeful, but not too hopeful; which is something the American people likely experienced when this film was released. This was a simple story. Nothing overly crazy happens throughout this film. Itï¿ 1/2(TM)s simply a story of an American family trying to make ends meet during a difficult time in America. Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson, along with the rest of the cast, in combination with the director, writer, producer, and others that contributed to the film, made this simple story not boring, but relatable. This film is not like the ones today with a lot of action, mystery, drama, and comedy. This film simply took the story of the Joad family and made it relatable to the rest of the American people. It is a story that is still relevant for today, and will forever be a historical turning point for the film industry.

From the beginning through the end of the journey, Tom Joad's determination to fight not only to get his family to their final destination but also to fight for what's right without prejudice, or discrimination due to their social and financial status is sincere and deeply felt. Specifically in his last scene with his good friend \"The Preacher\" played by John Carradine. \nI highly recommend watching this movie. At first, I did not think that I would enjoy it, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. To me the most positive part about this movie was seeing the portrayal of the importance of family values. Although the family is poor and the struggles are many, one thing that never fails is the love that they have for each other. The performance of all actors in the Joad family was very honest and represented the importance of family, love, hope, loyalty and respect. There are very powerful, emotional scenes where the interaction/exchange between characters is truly touching or I was able to feel the anger or frustration of the character. This is one of the key factors that makes a \"good\" movie.\nThis is a very old film in black and white, produced during a time where the movie effects available today were not available then. However, in multiple, if not the whole movie, the sound, music, change in sceneries and lighting effects, all together capture the true feeling and tone that makes up this wonderful production.

            "content": "John Ford directs a truly amazing production that allows viewers to see and feel what it was like during the Dust Bowl era. The story is based around the struggles of the Joad family and their migration from Oklahoma to California after being kicked off their due land. Throughout their journey, the family faces many struggles, some viewers may be able to relate to. As Tom Joad (main characters), Henry Fonda's performance was brilliant. From the beginning through the end of the journey, Tom Joad's determination to fight not only to get his family to their final destination but also to fight for what's right without prejudice, or discrimination due to their social and financial status is sincere and deeply felt. Specifically in his last scene with his good friend \"The Preacher\" played by John Carradine. \nI highly recommend watching this movie. At first, I did not think that I would enjoy it, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. To me the most positive part about this movie was seeing the portrayal of the importance of family values. Although the family is poor and the struggles are many, one thing that never fails is the love that they have for each other. The performance of all actors in the Joad family was very honest and represented the importance of family, love, hope, loyalty and respect. There are very powerful, emotional scenes where the interaction/exchange between characters is truly touching or I was able to feel the anger or frustration of the character. This is one of the key factors that makes a \"good\" movie.\nThis is a very old film in black and white, produced during a time where the movie effects available today were not available then. However, in multiple, if not the whole movie, the sound, music, change in sceneries and lighting effects, all together capture the true feeling and tone that makes up this wonderful production. In the end, writers and producers still delivered a movie that even a student like me did not want to stop watching.

I am totally rooting for this family because these two make me care about them. They are given the unforgiving task of delivering some heavy-handed monologues at the end, but it never came across as insincere, which had to be tough. \n\nWhile I realize this movie isn't based on a history book, I appreciated the strong historical feel of the story. These specific things probably didn't happen exactly as shown, but I thought the feel of that time was captured perfectly. There were things that they experienced that did happen back in those days, and trials that wrecked thousands of lives back then. \n\nRating and ranking films like The Grapes of Wrath is a challenge for me. On the one hand I see some real quality and care that went into the film. I see good acting and a well-crafted story. But on the other hand, it's just not enjoyable.

The way you review a movie made 76 years ago is you imagine you're in that year and put yourself in the place of a person watching the movie when it came out and then review it. After thinking about that it is pretty clear that this is a good movie. The acting was very believable and not once I thought that these are just actors. I felt like that they were really who they are and this is just us watching what was happening.\n\nI always felt bad for the family when something bad was happening to them. I just hoped that nothing else bad would happen to them. Many of the characters made me laugh in parts of the movie and it wasn't because of something went wrong or the screenplay was bad. It was that they were making a joke and it hit the right note. Looking at it in today's society I laughed a lot more in this than in a lot of the comedies now on tv and movies. That's something that today's movies lack is a touch of realism, you can tell it's a movie now and it's just for mindless fun and enjoyment. But a movie like this was made to have effect on people's lives and mean something. It stands out more than many movies from this decade.\n\nI knew that life during the great depression is bad but I could have never imagined it being like this. I've seen the first half of Cinderella man and know how bad it was to live in the city and to lose your job. But this is the first time I got to see what it was like for the farmers. Even though this movie is not based to a true story , it's like this is what actually happened to people in this decade. What happens to people in this time was terrible and in a way, this movie made justice for all of those people whose story was never told.",

Although the film itself is in black and white, the screenplay was written entirely in purple (as in purple prose) and and feels like the writers were trying to fill a minimum word requirement for an essay than create a realistic dialogue . The majority of the characters speaks almost entirely in deep, meaningful, almost shakespearean monologues that convey the same general messages over and over and over again, and destroy any sense of genuineness. Despite being poor/lower middle class farmers from Oklahoma, they all speak as if they are high school english teachers attempting to convey their superior vocabulary to a room full of students. And every speech is almost the exact same thing every time too, regardless of who is saying it. You could swap out one character's lines of dialogue in this films for another's, and not notice the difference. The only scrapes of character development in the film only serve to highlight the fact that these really aren't characters at all, merely shells created to stuff more dialogue and symbolism into, making them more fountains of pretentious rambling than anything else. The only two characters who at all speak differently from the rest, have different mannerisms or have different opinions or ways of solving problems, are killed, one of them being the father, who is at nearly the very start of the families journey.  In the end, the film becomes more boring and eye-rolling pretentious  than it does involving or heart wrenching because none of the main characters feel real enough to care about, and the story itself serves more to highlight its author's self-perceived flawless sense of morality than to highlight the struggles of real people.",

Henry Fonda is suitably rebellious as Tom Joad, the kid just back from prison who has to pack up with his family (11 all told) and navigate the route and the perils upon it.  So, it's a road movie of sorts, but the real drama takes place in the Golden State when their hopes and dreams are dashed. Director John Ford chose his character actors well (they are not all recongizable stars) and cinematographer Gregg Toland uses light beautifully both on location (particularly in the desert) and on the studio sets. Yet, for all the realness infused here, you can't forget this is a prestige picture, as the flow of things comes to a sudden halt every now and again when one of the players let loose with a hefty chunk of text from John Steinbeck's source novel.  Fonda gets the meatiest quotes (\"Wherever you can look - wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there...\") but the picture ends nobly with Ma Joad's (Jane Darwell) \"We are the people\" speech, apparently producer Zanuck's idea against John Ford's wishes for a more downbeat ending.  But how downbeat can you get?  That said, I reckon the actual reality for folks at that time was harsher and less cinematic.  For all their attempts to p a collective solution to the problems of poverty and exploitation by the owning classes, Steinbeck and Ford wound up being investigated by HUAC (even though Ford was a noted conservative).

            "content": "Based on one of the most famous novels of all time, I didn't know what to expect from The Grapes of Wrath but as a fan of Peter Fonda's acting I was more than happy to check it out.\n\nIn the 74 years since the release of The Grapes of Wrath, it still maintains the importance of its themes because of all the humanity. Although the story in The Grapes of Wrath dates back as far as 1939, it presents a society which has been forced to endure many of the same things under a society which is beginning to collapse in terms of democracy where people have been forced to look out for themselves and each other without the expectation that there will be someone there to do it for them. The theme is prevalent in the real world, and it reflects a lot of everyday life which has been placed into a different context, and it constantly has themes of optimism about the determination to keep going in the pursuit of happiness and the search for the American Dream. A story like the one in The Grapes of Wrath does not get old because it is constantly prevalent throughout society, and it reveals the way that we as people have to stand for who we are and what we do instead of waiting around for the world to change on its own. The optimism is consistent in The Grapes of Wrath, and it encourages viewers to go out and help to make the world a better place, so its themes are all important and easy to feel a connection to. The Grapes of Wrath proves simply to be a thoroughly compelling feature, even though it is a  very slowly moving one which runs for a rather long runtime and the fact that it doesn't really have too much to do a lot of the time.\nIf you can tolerate waiting around for The Grapes of Wrath to move along, you should be able to find it to be a compelling film which has characters that are easy to sympathise for simply because they are human beings who are facing adversity but have banded together to succeed as a team. The Grapes of Wrath is great because it touches upon themes of both independence and looking out for each other and reveals how both are key to a person's survival in a situation like The Great Depression. Really, The Grapes of Wrath is a great examination of humanity above all.\nVisually, The Grapes of Wrath is terrific because it is full of a lot of really strong visual aspects incorporated in by director John Ford who in his Academy Award winning role as director manages to prove once again that he has a keen eye for grand visuals. He constantly keeps the film rolling through visual excellence thanks to giving a lot of thoroughly convincing costumes and art direction to the film against the backdrop of its dry scenery and it is all captured with great cinematography which is filmed well enough to capture the large spectacle of the story. John Ford treats the story as he has treated many of his western films, and he gives it the same kind of visual quality which allows the film to develop a naturally rough edge. John Ford is a great choice as the director of The Grapes of Wrath, because as well as ensuring that the film is a visual spectacle he gives the story the right treatment so that none of its drama is degraded in the transfer from paper to the cinematic screen. Although the story is changed around a bit and it isn't as deep as its source material, for what it's worth The Grapes of Wrath does manage to capture the spirit of the novel and John Ford manages to take advantage of the chance to adapt it to the cinematic screen by bringing along a script that stays sufficiently true to its source material and visual elements that can only come from a director who has an appreciation for them. \nFrankly, The Grapes of Wrath stays true to the material of the classic novel that it is based on and manages to prove itself as a firm and mostly entertaining adaptation. And on top of it all, John Ford ensures that a perfect cast is lined up so that The Grapes of Wrath reaches its true potential.\nHenry Ford is the ideal actor for the role of Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath. Easily capturing the persona of a character who is very likable and sympathetic, Henry Fonda manages to load his lead performance in The Grapes of Wrath with natural charisma. Interacting with the other cast members as if he genuinely cares for them and speaking his words with serious thought, passion and wisdom behind them, Henry Fonda gives an exceptional lead performance in The Grapes of Wrath. The heart in him isn't over the top, it is simply in the way that he says he words with true love for them. And it is one of his greatest performances to date which earned him a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Henry Ford is an absolutely perfect casting decision for the lead in The Grapes of Wrath, and he makes it thoroughly compelling all throughout.\nJane Darwell also gives a really compelling performance because of the fact that she reminds us how family looks out for each other, being the caring matriarch of the Joad Family on their journey. Russell Simon and John Carradine do their part as well.\n\nSo despite being a film which is slow and long, none of the themes in The Grapes of Wrath mean any less today than they did back in 1940 and it is so thoughtful that its message carries itself over until today, as well as the fact that it has John Ford's keen eye for strong imagery and Henry Fonda's immense acting skill as a source of benefit.",

            "content": "I think a lot of people may be expecting one of my longer reviews for this one but I am going to try and make it shorter, because there isn't much to say except that this is a masterpiece (and although there is a change of tone at the end, and some censorship of the book, I understand why it was necessary because of the time), and mostly I will just offer my counter to a couple of common complaints people wrongly have about this movie. \r\n\r\nI think the biggest complaint I ever see is how the movie re-arranges the order of the migrant camps and censors some important parts of the book (such as the woman breatfeeding the sick man) but I have to say that given the time it was understandable. Also, it was John Ford's take on Grapes of Wrath and while Steinback's book was a masterpiece (and yes better than the film) this movie is also a masterpiece in its own way. Yes, the ending is more optimistic but it rings much of the same message that the novel yielded, it was just made more subtle and more hopeful, which again given the time it was made I can see why it was necessary. That being said, that makes me very open to the re-make that Spielberg is doing for the novels 75th anniversary because it can adapt the book and not feel like a remake of this movie. The book and film for Grapes of Wrath are different, but they are both still powerful, impactful, and bring the same important, timeless themes. \r\n\r\nAnother complaint I have heard (not often) was they thought the acting was bad, and the best thing to say is that they clearly haven't watched much film from this era. A lot of the older, classic films are done in a different acting style (You can make an exception with Citizen Kane) and filmed differently than they are today, and for an important reason. The acting that you see in many classic films, such as Grapes of Wrath, is done much closer to stage acting and putting on a recording a stage like play without the limitations a stage play has. Eventually, with movies like Citizen Kane (which is why this movie is so important) you see filmmakers learning they aren't limited like you are on stage and they can provide a much more realistic approach to the story that a stage play couldn't because of its restrictiveness. Even if you don't have this knowledge of why the acting seems weird to you (it's a different acting style, a different style does NOT make the acting bad) it's fairly to realize that the performances in this movie are fantastic, they are iconic, powerful, and continue to be remembered and watched to this day. \r\n\r\nNow I am going to take a brief moment to talk about what makes this film so powerful (since this is a movie review I won't touch on the book that much, but the book is just (actually probably more) as impactful) and it has to be that the movie completely depicts the era, it may be fictional but the migrant workers were not fictional, what they went through was not fictional, and the themes showed the importance for the migrant workers to keep their dignity. The film shows how man will turn against man when he has fear of losing his power and that one of the greatest struggles at the time was not the Dustbowl, but the corruption of the few in power to stop others from ever being able to obtain anything, even if it meant having the thousands upon thousands starve or be beaten and die. Another important thing to note is many of those migrant camps shown in this movie were REAL migrant camps, there were many families that went through what the Joads went through, the movie depicted exactly how corrupt the powerful could actually get (in one of the more wealthy countries) and how they would (and did) treat the thousands in need like complete dogs because of the fear of losing any power. \r\n\r\nI went a little longer with this review than I actually intended (I did not want to write an essay for this, to many people have analyzed this film and book enough to where I can't really contribute much more) but Grapes of Wrath is a powerful movie, with many impactful themes that continue to resonate in importance today as they did 70 years ago, it is a timeless classic that will never die. 10/10",

Based on the classic and controversial novel by John Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath is deserving of the greatest film title and is possibly one of the most powerful films a person can witness.\r\n\r\nDuring the Great Depression, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) returns home to Oklahoma after spending jail time only to find that The Dust Bowl has consumed their crops and the lack of profits has forced them to leave their homes. Tom and his family load up and head to the \"land of milk and honey\", that is, California, to try to find work and live a better. What they learn the hard way is that the grass isn't always greener on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe film also features Jane Darwell in an Oscar-winning performance as Ma Joad, Russell Simpson as Pa Joad, John Carradine as Jim Casey, a former preacher who joins the ride, and Doris Bowden plays the family's pregnant girl.\r\n\r\nThe Grapes of Wrath, both the book and this film, have been the subject of controversy since its original release, especially in the political crowd. The \"right\" politicians accuse it of going too far to the \"left\" while others accuse it of promoting communism. Fans of the book have also criticized the film for changing the ending to make it a little happier. When it comes to watching movies, I don't watch a movie to analyze a director's political views or the whole political message of the story; I watch a movie to escape political problems and have a good time. For The Grapes of Wrath, this experience paid off, and I experienced a drama that's very powerful to watch.\r\n\r\nNow I never experienced the Great Depression personally, but with this film, I can fully understand why it's called a great depression. Farmers being kicked out of their homes cause they don't have enough crops, coming to California to find a better life only to be accused of communist strikers. It's a very depressing film for some, especially those who are still around to remember it, and it's also a very difficult film to watch. But, I managed to get through it all, and I loved every minute of it.\r\n\r\nFor starters, the black-and-white cinematography is outstanding. Although the majority of the film was filmed in Hollywood sets, the cinematographer really makes you believe that the opening scenes were in Oklahoma. The lighting in the nighttime shots are stunning and should have at least earned an Oscar nomination. I don't know how the cinematography here was snubbed.\r\n\r\nBut what really serves as the inspiration to the film's success are the acting performances. The lead actor, Henry Fonda, is fantastic as Tom Joad, and should have won the Oscar here (he lost to best friend Jimmy Stewart for his role in The Philadelphia Story). Fonda delivers in a lot of emotional scenes, such as his reaction to the Dust Bowl and a scene involving the burning of a worker camp. The other strong performance here is Jane Darwell as Ma Joad. Like Fonda, she delivers in a lot of dramatic scenes, such as the scene where she says goodbye to the farm and her final speech at the end. She ended up winning the Oscar, and while I thought she was great, the Supporting Actress Oscar should have gone to Judith Anderson for her role as the creepy maid in Rebecca. I was also impressed with John Carradine as Casey the former preacher. For a preacher who \"lost his spirit\", Carradine's take on the character is very memorable and I was impressed with the intensity in his performance.\r\n\r\nPOSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:\r\nThe ending has caused problems for many people, especially fans of the book. The book ending involved the pregnant woman's baby to die and something about her feeding an old man. (I might be rusty, cause I've never read the book). The film ended with Fonda's departure and the family's hope for survival. My belief in films based on books is that the film needs to keep the spirit of the book without trying to copy the book. For The Grapes of Wrath, I found nothing wrong with the film ending. For 1940, Hollywood was cautious of depressing its audience (especially in the wake of WWII), and I believe the ending was changed to inspire the audience for hope of better times. That's a good message that can apply in today's times. \r\nEND OF SPOILERS\r\n\r\nIt may be controversial in the changed ending and in the world of politics, but The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful, stunning, and inspiring film. Had it not been for the political controversies, the film might have won Best Picture. But at least the year's winner, Hitchcock's Rebecca, was a film that was worthy of the award.",

            "content": "It's difficult on a first viewing of \"The Grapes of Wrath\" not to be somewhat disappointed with it. So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film, and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the \"gee whizz\" style of film-making so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book, you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own, and the film inspires a great deal of admiration, and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.\n\nOf course the most controversial parts of the book are left out (like its final image, for example), but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film. Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad--never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect. And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad--she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel. The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland, who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything. Indeed, much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images, and isn't that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do? One of those films that feels ahead of its time.",

Die meisten klassischen amerikanischen Autoren mit ihren klassischen amerikanischen Themen interessieren mich einen Gugelhupf. Aber was tut man nicht alles fürs Studium, und wie schön ist es manchmal überrascht zu werden wenn man über seinen Schatten springt.\n\nFilm ist nunmal ein anderes Medium als ein Roman und was John Ford hier präsentiert kommt nicht nur überraschend, sondern auch gekonnt.\n\nGregg Toland war der Mann an der Kamera. Das ist der gleiche Herr, der durch Citizen Kane Weltruhm erlangte und den Deep Focus-Hype auslöste. Seine Fertigkeiten zeigt er auch hier, und erstaunlich oft kann man auch schon in The Grapes of Wrath Deep Focus erkennen.\nToland und Ford schaffen es auf geniale Weise poetische Bilder zu erzeugen, teils fast expressionistisch spielen sie mit Schatten und Silhouetten und geben dem Film einen unvergleichbaren Look. Die karge Armut rückt oft fast in den Hintergrund angesichts der genialen Kameraeinstellungen und mise-en-scène Entscheidungen.\n\nDie visuelle Poesie wird stimmig von poetischen Dialogen begleitet. Vieles scheint mir direkt von Steinbeck übernommen, und auch wenn ich teilweise bezweifle, dass Farmer aus Oklahoma so sprechen, ist es doch ein Ohrenschmaus.\n\nDer Film weiß jedoch nicht nur durch Dialoge und malerische Bilder zu überzeugen. Die Thematik ist eigentlich der Hauptgrund warum The Grapes of Wrath ein perfektes Rating abstaubt.\nGerade von John Ford hätte ich nie ein sozialkritisches Drama mit stark linken Tendenzen erwartet. Die Thematik ist bis heute aktuell - wie sehr muss sich die arbeitende Bevölkerung gefallen lassen gegeneinander am Arbeitsmarkt ausgespielt zu werden. In der Great Depression nahm dieser Kampf natürlich ganz andere Maßstäbe an als heute.\n\nDas Endergebnis ist ein tragisches, herzzerreißendes und charakterbetontes Drama auf Weltniveau.\nHenry Fonda ankert den Film als Tom Joad, ein Mann, der nach einem Mord aus dem Gefängnis zurückkehrt, nur um seine Heimat verloren vorzufinden - seine Familie hat ihre Farm verloren und muss nach Kalifornien auswandern. Tom wirkt nicht wie ein gefährlicher Mann, beweist aber zwei, drei Mal seine Gewalt und seinen Willen für seine Überzeugungen zu kämpfen.\nJane Darwell, damals mit dem Oscar für die beste Nebendarstellerin geehrt, überzeugt als Toms Mutter, die die Familie zusammenhält.\nEbenso erwähnenswert ist ein enorm wandlungsfähiger John Carradine, den ich über die Fortdauer des Films nicht erkannt hatte. Er spielt den ehemaligen Pfarrer der Gemeinde in Oklahoma, der die Joads begleitet auf der Suche nach einem neuen Lebensinhalt (den er im Sozialismus finden sollte).\n\nWas zeichnet den Film also aus: ein geniales Drehbuch samt großartiger Dialoge, geile Kameraeinstellungen zu Hauf, gute schauspielerische Leistungen und ein knackiges Sozialdrama, dass sich erst nach einiger Zeit als politisches Drama zu erkennen gibt.",

John Ford's film is a hauntingly vivid vision of poverty and hopelessness but the unity of a family to find strength in difficult situations. At a time when Hollywood often dished always fewer films with a social weight and importance as this one, The Grapes of Wrath really stands out as a genuine and rare portrayal of difficult situations the kind that neo realists did in Italy. Gregg Toland's photography is stunning as usual.",

Maybe it's not so much the grapes that are wrathful as much as it's the grapevine, because if root is associated with all evil, then vines have to at least be pretty wrathful. Symbolic and ironically fitting planting term jokes aside, whenever I look at that title, I can't help but imagine a giant bunch of grapes descending from the sky and destroying everything so that the humans would finally know what it's like to be juiced, though I knew that this film would never be about that, because Steinbeck probably wouldn't do something that stupid. Lennie Small would look at that book and say, \"I may be retarded, but don't insult my intelligence\", but hey, it wouldn't be too much cheesier than this film's trailer, whose first minute was spent going on and on about the success of the book and even went as far as to put together corny dramatisations involving people talking about how they've \"never had such a demand for a book\" and \"can't supply the demand\". Of course, when you get down to it, the film is hardly cheesy, or at least about as hardly cheesy as it could get in 1940, which is probably why this film won John Ford his, like, sixteenth Oscar and hardly anything else. Well, to be fair, John Ford could have directed the biggest piece of garbage ever, and he would have still won Best Director, as sure as the hypothetical film in question would be lauded as a masterpiece fifty years later. Shoot, Ford's been dead since '73, and I'm surprised he's still not winning Oscars, as the Oscars did love him just so much, and I'm fine with that, because the man sure know how to make some good films, such as this one, and yet, as rewarding as this film is, not everything in this effort proves fruitful... if fruitful is actually supposed to mean rewarding.\r\n\r\nQuite a bit has aged reasonably gracefully with this, for its time, in quite a few ways, fairly unique film, yet there's no getting around that, at the same time, quite a bit has dated, and often pretty cheesily, with dialogue being particularly faulty, whether when it's turning in a couple of shoddy one-off lines or serving as a component to the film's awkward exposition. The film opens up with Henry Fonda's Tom Joad character catching a ride after getting out of jail and predicting the thoughts and curiosity of the driver, just so explanations on where Joad was coming from and why he was sent there could be crowbarred in, and while expository dialogue pieces of that nature in the subsequent body are rarely on that level of awkward unsubtlety, screenwriter Nunnally Johnson puts only so much subtle delicacy into crafting plot and characters, with the character aspects being particularly flawed, partially because of some of the performances behind the characters. Now, some performances are better than others, with John Qualen stealing the show for the startlingly limited amount of time that he's occupies, delivering a strong presence, complimented by a surprising amount of potent emotional range, both strikingly broad and hauntingly subtle, that defines the human depth of the victims of this terrible time and helps in making the early acts effective as a hook. Of course, that's just the hook that Qualen all but carries, and outside of that, while you can expect quite a few other passable, if not reasonably decent performances, particularly that of the Oscar-earning Jane Darwell, also expect to see a couple of performances that fall flat as hardly effective, occasionally embarassingly, with Henry Fonda proving ineffective as a key lead by donning a presence near-devoid of layer variety, and making it all the worse through sometimes wooden, sometimes overdone and altogether nearly consistently weak line delivery. There are more strengths to the characterization than missteps, thus compensations for some faulty performances can be found, and backed up by perhaps as many fair performances as improvable ones, yet the fact of the matter is that the handling and portrayal of many of the characters who help drive this plot isn't without its shortcomings, much like other areas in plotting, for although the story is strong enough and, in quite a few areas, well-structured enough to make the final product compelling, there gets to be too much filler and not enough material to fully sustain your emotional investment, which leaves the potency of the dramatic depth to go a bit distanced at times. Again, the film is a compelling one today as sure as it was during its time, yet much has not aged as gracefully as it probably should have, with certain aspects being improvable on a general level, thus making for a flawed drama, yet one that rewards nevertheless. The film has its fair share of shortcomings, yet accels more often than not, particularly when it comes to visual style.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the visual style of this 1940 black-and-white film has dated all but considerably, yet for its time, Gregg Toland's cinematography was stunning, and remains commendable to this day, boasting near-striking detail and near-exceedingly clever lighting play that accentuates both darkness and light in a fashion that proves to be both quite handsome and supplementary to the film's tonal and, to a certain degree, thematic depths. If you can claim appreciation for the relative uniqueness of the Toland's photographic efforts, then you'll find yourself hard pressed to not be consistently engaged by the visual artistry that both catches your eye and stands as one of your more subtle touches to the film's depth, which isn't to say that the script is completely devoid of much of the graceful subtlety that this subject matter deserves. Again, some of the film's biggest flaws usually rest within Nunnally Johnson's screenplay, which gets to be all too often rather awkward and, in some areas, problematically-structured, yet perhaps on the whole, Johnson's take on John Steinbeck's classic vision, whether it be faithful or loose, stands reasonably strong, boasting only so much color in exposition and depth, yet color, nevertheless, that fleshes out and breathes enough life into the story to keep it lively and engaging, or at least more so, as the basic story concept, alone, holds quite a bit of livliness and engagement value. Yes, people, while I have, of course, not read Steinbeck's classic Pulitzer Prize winner that was apparently too successful for them to, at least according this film's aforementioned lame trailer, \"supply the demand\", yet am still quite aware that, after a while, this film strays quite a ways away from the original source material, yet whether it was the vision of Steinbeck or the revision of Johnson, what I'm seeing here is a very potent story concept with strong ideas, complimented by much dynamicity and weight of both a tonal and thematic nature, and while the execution of the worthy story concept doesn't always do the subject matter total justice, Johnson does a generally decent job of handling the tale, while director John Ford does an even better job. Now, with that said, it's not like John Ford's directorial efforts prove thoroughly effective, as he could work better with Johnson's script and Steinbeck's story, as sure as he could work better with more than a few performers, yet on the whole, Ford's efforts feel nothing short of inspired enough to keep atmosphere alive in order to produce a consistent degree of vitality that creates entertainment value, as well as an occasional degree of dramatic punch to really spark engagement value. The film's emotional resonance isn't exactly thorough, nor does it always age all that gracefully, yet it's there, and when it arrives, it often truly engrosses with graceful humanity that won't exactly leave you to cry your eyes out, but will certainly move you as it defines much depth within this should-be more well-handled tale. Make no mistake, this film could have indeed been better, yet as it stands, what is done right has enough charge to it to grip consistently and leave you to walk away rewarded.\r\n\r\nTo wrap up, the film finds its share of cheesily dated areas, whether it be dialogue or certain spots in exposition and characterization, whose effectiveness go further softended by more than a few improvable performances to match the passable, or even commendable performances, and with moments of problematic plotting proving to be distancing, the final product comes out falling short of its potential, yet not to an underwhelming state, going supported by striking cinematography and a worthy story concept, brought to life with general success by Nunnally Johnson's colorful script and John Ford's reasonably inspired direction, thus leaving \"The Grapes of Wrath\" to stand as a flawed yet ultimately compelling and rewarding classic dramatic piece.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

Hell, it's just one of the the great films of all time.  Henry Fonda somehow ended up NOT winning Best Actor for his inhabiting the role of Tom Joad. (That reason being that Jimmy Stewart didn't win Best Actor for Mr. Smith goes to Washington the previous year, so they gave him the Oscar for The Philadelphia Story instead) Fonda was able to do so much with simple facial expressions and body language to communicate what was going on inside, it's mesmerizing to watch. John Ford won the Best Director Oscar for this film, showing how a great director doesn't waste a single moment and there's absolutely no extraneous filler to be seen. The use of darkness/black is astounding in the film, great work of cinematography and great camera work on closeups of starving children and the faces of the adults who have to see it.  Ford was the greatest film chronicler of the West and Manifest Destiny, so it's fascinating to see his take on what was in many ways, the last great Westward migration, during the Great Depression.  Above all else, this is the story of the human spirit, it's will to survive, endure, and move forward in the face of crippling adversity. Leaving the politics behind, focusing on the people, is what made this film great, and what will keep it great and relevant for all time.",

You just can't help but to feel for the plight of the main characters, and follow them intently as they continuously journey onward searching for hope and prosperity.  In a rather grim fashion, the characters are forced to confront disappointment, and ultimately persecution and hardship at every turn.\n\nThis classic John Steinbeck story is perhaps as relevant now as it was back in the 30s; it serves to criticize the ideals of the American dream, and it proves quite effective as it documents the migration of displaced farmers and workers across the nation.  The story is a journey that pushes the characters to extremes, and provides a fairly hellish view of the dustbowl in general.  It's driven by a constant pattern, in which the characters come close to finding what they're looking for, and then having it snatched away from them.  It's pretty bleak, but the characters remain endearing, especially with their endless conviction and motivation.\n\nOn film, the story is immortalized with excellent photography and editing.  The acting is swell:  Henry Fonda, John Carradine, and heck, just about everybody inhabit their characters quite well.  The writing is superb.  This production is loaded with good, real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales.

            "content": "As one of the most critically acclaimed pieces of literature in American history, it was nearly inevitable that John Steinbeckâ??s 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath would eventually be made into a film. John Ford soon pounced on this opportunity making The Grapes of Wrath a film only a year after the novels original release. While John Fords recreation of The Grapes of Wrath stayed accurate to the book on which it was based in terms of general ideas and events, he chose to leave out significant events that led to important messages the Pulitzer prize winning story was meant to provide its audience with. Ford also chose to take a much different path in terms of what the Joad family meant to the story. Steinbeck used the Joads as an example of a typical family traveling west during the dustbowl, while Ford focused less on the familyâ??s journey, and more on the relationship between Tom Joad and his mother. While the Film provides its audience with a significant history lesson similar to that of Steinbeckâ??s version, the novel remains superior, as it provides a meaningful life lesson to its readers.\n\tJohn Steinbeckâ??s The Grapes of Wrath utilizes the character Rose of Sharon to educate the reader on many different aspects of being a pregnant woman during the dust bowl. Steinbeck zeroâ??s in on her emotions, her relationship with both her family and husband Connie, and her realization that she truly has a purpose on earth. Her purpose, as ma told her, was that when the baby was born she would be responsible for a human life, and the way that child turned out would be based on her parenting. When her pregnancy unfortunately results in a miscarriage, she realizes her purpose wasnâ??t necessarily to assist the life of that child, but those in need. This realization occurs when she meets an emaciated man in a barn that she proceeds to help survive. This lesson by Steinbeck shows the reader that every person has a purpose, and that it will eventually be discovered. While Rose of Sharon was very important in the book, she played a minimal role in the movie. Ford does not give Rose of Sharon many lines at all, and her emotions throughout the story are barely even touched upon. Ford includes the relationship between Rose of Sharon and Connie in order to keep accuracy to the book, but the significance of the relationship seems completely unnoticed by Ford. Because Fords adaptation of The Grapes of Wrath ignores Rose of Sharon as a character, it fails to utilize the significance of her pregnancy, and the important message that went along with it in the novel. Although the end of the book is not included in the novel, it cannot be fully blamed on John Ford. These final scenes were not included in the film due to the controversy with the public the scenes were presumed to have caused (IMDB).\n\tThe journey from Oklahoma was a long treacherous one for a 1930â??s American family commuting in an over occupied jalopy, or at least it was portrayed that way in Steinbeckâ??s version of the story. Steinbeck focuses a majority of his novel on the Joads trip to California, in order to stay true to reality. Ford chooses to make the journey of the Joads less important than the familyâ??s experience once they arrive in the Promised Land. The main focus in each version of The Grapes of Wrath differ greatly: Steinbeck used the family as more of a way to display the journey and dynamic of an average family of the time period, and possible troubles they may encounter, whereas Ford focuses mostly on the Joad familyâ??s experiences upon arriving in California. This comparison can be supported by the fact that John Fordâ??s production left out most of the inner chapters consisting of an abundance of metaphors that Steinbeck used to craft the various messages of his novel.\n\t It is safe to say that a book totaling over 450 pages has much more room for analysis than that in a 2-hour movie. This disability for film certainly shows in this situation. Not only did the film not include the metaphorical chapters and ending that the novel did, they also developed the characters much less. This definitely shows in the underdevelopment of Rose of Sharon and Connie. Given the time constraint, Ford does an excellent job developing the character of Ma. He inserts her as the heart and soul of the family, which would be more meaningful if the start of the novel were included where Steinbeck explains that all families looked at the bravery of the men to gauge their attitudes. Although the Novel proves superior to the film in many significant categories, the movie by no means fails. John Ford took on a tremendous challenge in creating The Grapes of Wrath. Ford certainly succeeded in making the dialogue and scenery accurate to what one would have assumed from reading the book. Whether one becomes acquainted with the Grapes of Wrath visually or by text, the experience will certainly not be a disappointment.",

            "content": "Film Review: The Grapes of Wrath\nNearly every book is better than the movie. The Grapes of Wrath based off John Steinbeckâ(TM)sâ(TM) masterpiece is no exception. The Grapes of Wrath was made into film in 1940, yet today we can still say it is easily one of the most significant films ever produced in American history. Its significance is not only that of film making accomplishments at the time, but the historical context of the story. The film follows the Joad family on their California bound trip towards a better life. In the process they meet a number of characters, encounters and dangers. The real accomplishment of the film though is the cinematographic advance made at the time. Today, we donâ(TM)t regard the Grapes of Wrathâ(TM)s cinematography as the best of today, leaving the viewer with a huge gap between intended effect and actual effect. Perhaps that is the greatest fault of the film. \nThe main reason for the gap between director and audience in the film is the fact that the movie is, quite simply, so old. Todayâ(TM)s audience thrives on films such as Avatar, nearly 60% computer generated, The Hangover and Pirates of the Caribbean, all of which had great technical experts and stunt doubles on board. Today, we have become accustomed to technology and ability. It is a vital part of our life and a crucial part of movie making. It is because we are used to high tech movies. We are accustomed to seeing innovative angles used to capture the scene as it unfolds. Hardly are viewers today used to black and white pictures on the scene or grains in the images. As a film for an audience today to watch and enjoy, the cinematography is simply too different. \nOverall, the process of movie making has not changed a great deal, but technological advances have made colors brighter, transitions easier, editing smother, etc. An audience viewing a film that was made over 70 years ago in black and white wonâ(TM)t receive the films same message if the film were to be recreated with the same script today. The somewhat choppy transitions between scenes or the panning from face to face seems immature by todayâ(TM)s standards. Itâ(TM)s not that the film was poorly made. At the time, it was a demonstration of how far technology had come and a great asset to the movie making industry. \nEven more so, the film itself does contain many of the same lines, scenes and nearly all of the same characters as the masterfully crafted book but it lacks the final scene: a scene which, in all essence, makes the book. To exempt the final scene in the barn from the movie would have tacked on another ten minutes to make the story work. But the feature already runs 128 minutes, whats ten or even twenty more? \nQuite simply, the film was a great leap for its time and we will continue to remember it as an iconic asset to the history of movie making, nothing more. It doesnâ(TM)t make sense to remember it for any other reason other than that it is of legendary importance. Other movies have been made that surpass the technical qualities and acting abilities in the Grapes of Wrath. The Grapes of Wrath deserved its Grammy nominations. But even with its high honors and achievements, it is simply not the type of film one would walk away from today and say, âI wanna see that againâ?. It is the type of film one must see in their lifetime because it is a legend. Even being a legend, the book is always better than the movie.",

This is a highly critically acclaimed movie and is famous for its strong acting performances by Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell, though it moves pretty slow and if I had to pick a grape movie, I would have rather watched \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\"  A few of the more memorable scenes are John Qualen's flashback about everybody being forced off of their land, the elderly grandfather (Charley Grapewin)'s refusal to leave his home, and just about any dialogue delivered by Ma Joad (Darwell).  I don't know that I would rank her performance as Oscar-worthy, but she is the first thing to come to my mind when I think about this film.  Even though the film is lauded for its acting, my enjoyment stems from John Steinbeck's story.  The screenplay writers sacrificed a lot of tragedy by changing some of the ending events but the film still captures the helpless situation of Great Depression victims.  The loss of humanity in this situation stuck out to me, as families are desperately searching for work to support their families and business men take advantage of their desperation.  It may not be my favorite, but I'm not surprised that \"The Grapes of Wrath\" appears on a lot critics must-see lists and find it to be a historically relevant film that should be experienced.",

If I was to pray, I'd pray for folks that's alive and don't know which way to turn. \n\nThe Grapes of Wrath is very much the classic I was expecting. It is probably the best example of the human struggle to better one's life. The story is one of the most known, as most read it before their out of high school. It's setting is the depression era dust bowl. There's a lot of bad going on and not a whole lot of good. Everyone struggles to find work so that they can feed their families. But work isn't easy to come by. Watching The Grapes of Wrath now, during this economic climate is rather sobering.\n\nThe story follows one family, the Joad family. Tom has just been released from prison and makes it home just in time; right before his family was to set off from their land. They have lived in Oklahoma all their life, but the land is turning a profit or any crops and the government is taking it away from them. So the Joad's decide to do what everyone else is doing, and head for California in hope of finding the land they were promised. Handbills don't always tell the exact truth though. California is just as much a struggle as Oklahoma.\n\nThis is only the second John Ford film I have seen, but I'm already seeing why he is so highly regarded. He captures the hardship of the depression like no film I've seen. He does it extremely well, but also never overplays it. He let's the Joad family speak for themselves. Their hungry, their tired, and their poor. \n\nSomething else Ford does really well is showing the different ends of the spectrum, when it comes to people helping people. Their are always people that will help and their are always people that will exploit. In one scene the Joad's go into a diner and the workers there give them food at a discounted cost because they see how hard they got it. Then when they actually get work, all the employers are just exploiting how poor the workers are. \n\nGrapes of Wrath is often regarded as one of the best American films ever. It's a movie that everyone knows about and it's influence is just about everywhere. It's one of those movies that everyone almost has to see before they die; a true classic in every sense of the word.",

            "content": "John Ford directed a film based off a novel that everyone loved. It was written in 1939 and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940. This is just 10 years after the stock market crash and everyone was still feeling the effects. A year after the book was published, The Grapes of Wrath came to the big screen. John Ford gave the people something to connect to. They were seeing stories that they knew all too well. But it showed them they weren't alone. There is such great heart behind the film that it hard not to feel something from it. I think the first scene that really hit me was when Ma put the earrings over her ears and looked at herself in the mirror. Here's a woman who has been evicted from her home and is leaving the state the next day. She misses being the pretty young woman she once was. Where did the time go? What about this future that you dream about having when you're young? All of this within a single shot. And the film is filled with these moments. Tom Joad wants to change himself around and help his family move to California and give them a better life. But he can't stand someone treating someone else poorly. We assume this is why he fought and killed a man, which landed him a 7 year sentence in prison. Henry Fonda plays this rough character in an interesting way. We don't think he's dangerous, but when he is put in a situation we know what he will do. The way he looks at the police passing him, or when they get to the camp to pick peaches he won't take their lies. It was an interesting choice that when they bring Grandpa on the truck to leave Uncle Joe's house he is as stiff as a board, like a dead body. I thought that was perfect. And the night they get stopped and Grandma is dead in the truck with her eyes open gave me an eery feeling. I just had a feeling she was dead without having been told much. John Ford really didn't have to say too much with the film. He lets you feel what is going on. Just show the tragedy of everyone and that's all you need. These are the working class and they will be around forever. We see them today, and this story will, sadly, always have a relevance to society.",

Lead by a moving performance by Henry Fonda who is out of prison on early parole, the \"Joads\" are on route to California, where they believe they can find work and restart their lives. Along the way, they mourn loses of loved ones and cherish whatever they have to survive. They make stops in campgrounds and pitch tents so that they may have a place to keep warm enough through the night. As the worst possible occurences come their way, Tom (Fonda) finds himself killing a man, which then leads to him having to make decisions of where to move next. This is one of the most moving pictures of all time. The cinematography makes you feel that you are in every situation and the dialogue will make you cringe. It is wonderfully written and the direction by John Ford is heart-stopping. There is never a dull moment in this film. I would be underrating this film by calling it a masterful breakthrough in cinema, because the only word to describe this work of art, is \"Spine-tinglingly, awe-inspiringly, magnificent!\"",

John Ford captures the majority of Steinbeck's message, although leaving out the most crucial meaning that Steinbeck hoped to render. \r\n\tThis film captured its audience and made them part of the Joad family. Using advanced camera placements, such as the hood of the Joad's Jalopy, the viewer has a first person view on history. Although fiction, Ford brings forth the true trials from the times and positions them for a revolutionary experience. \r\n\tWith option for color, Ford succumbed to his natural liking for black and white. This allowed a poor feel for the movie, again bringing forth the emotions that families must have felt.\r\n\tThis is a great movie, but Steinbeck's message of community was lost. The film focuses on only the Joads, but the novel focused on twenty families becoming one. This sense of community is vital in creating a successful novel, but with consolidation for a film, Ford let go of community. Not only was community an important point in Steinbeck's overall message, but more predominately capitalism. The film conveys not relativity to capitalism, yet the novel does. \r\n\tFor a fun and entertaining experience, the Grapes of Wrath is a great movie. After boarding the rollercoaster film, one will walk away with appreciation for what they have and will have deeper knowledge of history. \r\n\tAlthough a moving film, the novel definitely should be read. Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath includes much more detail and a stronger ending that capitalizes on his point of capitalism. \r\n\tBoth the film and the novel are very well done, but the movie is only half of the book's success.",

            "content": "If one was to watch The Grapes of Wrath without reading the book it would be considered a great movie. Throughout the entire movie John Ford accurately captures the feelings and emotions generated by this time in American history. Utilizing black and white film rather than color gives the movie a somewhat desolate appearance which mirrors the dust and sand of the setting and the general distress of the farmers. The farmers, who have been left out to dry by big corporations, are on their way to California where they have heard that there are plenty of jobs for all because the large land owners have taken their land. \r\nThe camera work was well done by capturing the Joad family and the tribulations that they go through.  The acting was well done by Henry Fonda as Tom Joad and Jane Darwell as Ma Joad for example. \r\n However, the movie changes Steinbeck's message and because of this can only be considered mediocre at best. In the book, Steinbeck preaches that in society community is the most important aspect rather than the individual. While in the movie the focus strays from the importance of the community and sticking together and centers more on the family where the overall meaning seems to be the Joad family and that the family will get together rather than teaming up with other people in the same situation. For example, in the book there it starts to rain and the families in the sourounding camp must help each other shovel dirt into banks to keep the camp from flooding and this reiterates Steinbecks point of community. But this and other scenes are left absent from the movie including the ending where Rose of Sharan breast feeds starving man to save him from death. These missing scenes from the movie readjust's the true meaning of Steinbeck's story so if you want just a good movie rather than book-to-movie accuracy I'd go for it.",

            "content": "This is one of the few films on Rotten Tomatoes with a 100% rating.  The reason why is because, well, it´s a classic, in almost every sense.  It was one of the first 25 films to be selected for preservation in the US National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.  The book it's based on is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by John Steinbeck.  \r\n\r\nSo what kind of film is this?  Well, it's movie based on a historical event; depicting both the Dust Bowl and many elements of the Great Depression.  For two, the film itself is historically significant given the time period and context it was made (in 1940).  For three, it is a powerful film about a family living in what seems the most dire of times and succeeding regardless, through thick and thin.  All three of these are important things to consider when viewing this film.\r\n\r\nOne thing to keep in mind is that at the time it was produced, faith in capitalism had been extremely shaken.  The Great Depression seemed a failure throughout the majority of the western world, with the country being least hit by the Great Depression being the one that lay outside of the international markets in that area -- the USSR, namely.  The USSR had such a unique economic system that lay outside of almost every other economic system currently in use, it was not affected when world trade was.\r\n\r\nThis is important to note, as the Grapes of Wrath is undoubtedly sympathetic towards Communism -- although the book goes more heavily into this than the film does, from what I've heard (I haven't read it myself yet, alas, and will edit this review if I am proven wrong).  In the present day perspective, only one country with communism really \"succeeded\", and that's China; and even then, China is growing more and more capitalist economically, while still remaining an autocratic government.  Thus, modern day perspective and the perspective this film was made in are decidedly different.\r\n\r\nThe events seen in the film that are touched on are also historically interesting; I watched this film as part of my American History from WWI to WWII course, and it was an intense time period, especially in the dust bowl.  The scene in the plains of the US was an amazing story in and of itself, from when the Comanche were driven from the area, from when XIT Ranch bought a major chunk of land, from when XIT tried to raise cows and failed miserably, and then sold the land as real estate for people to farm a living on land that, while good for grass, was crap for wheat and vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe film doesn't quite focus on this, however, more catching the tail end with the dusters.  Grapes of Wrath instead focuses on another idea; small groups of wealthy men and business owners driving out many tenant farmers with industrial machinery (namely, the caterpillar tractor), and big business becoming the major problem of the Depression.  This theme is explored again and again throughout the film, where in every place the Joads family traveled to, the common man was the one that tried to look out for one another; there's a very significant scene in a diner that I felt particularly emotional:  The owner gives the Joads a $.15 loaf of bread for $.10, and two $.05 candies to the children for $0.01 for both, out of compassion... and then the wise-cracking truck drivers paid with what seemed like a full silver dollar, leaving without taking their change.  However, big bosses did not show this level of generosity, explicitly exploiting workers whenever they could; in the case of a boss offering a job for peach-picking $0.50, and then halving it when he can.  Workers strike, and he finds other workers to pay the $0.5 for, intending to repeat the process over again.\r\n\r\nWherever the family goes, people seem to grow more and more selfish, with the only truly selfless people being the few workers that had had enough and were trying to fight back in any way they could.  Than the Joads finally reach a place that almost seemed like out of a Normal Rockwell painting; a community that had dances, laughter, showers, and generally where one could feel civilized again.  This small community is the closest one can find to a commune; the police are not allowed inside without a warrant (on exception of a strike), and those in charge of the community are voted by the five different sectors that comprise it.  While there's a conspiracy between police and bosses to try to destroy the community, they are quickly outwitted subtly, through good observation and looking out for one another's back.\r\n\r\nAll of this shows a very important theme of the worker vs. the industrial baron, with definitely a sympathetic eye to the ideals of communism.  But that's enough about the history and context; onto the film itself.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is good.  It's well-paced, it's interesting, it has cast members that fill their role incredibly well, and perhaps something I found most interesting, it had a strong female character not defined by sexuality -- Ma Joad, played by Jane Darwell.  She makes an interesting character throughout this film, being the foundation the rest of the family can rest upon.  She's quick-witted and able to do what needs to be done as the family goes on, never giving in to the hardships that surround her.\r\n\r\nI could probably go on some more, but I should probably save it for the actual essay I'm to write on this film.  I'll just finish by saying this:  If you have any interest in this period of time or on the Great Depression in general, or if you want to see a great classic and don't mind a black and white film, this should be your choice.",

What really stood out to me was the the cinematography. I was reading that the DP and director John Ford tried to replicate the look and feel of the pictures and film taken of the actual Depression. With the stark overpowering shadows and great costume design I'd say they nailed it. It was quite a bit happier and optimistic than the book (and quite a bit more entertaining). I was surprised to find out Steinbeck actually loved the movie in spite of the drastic changes. It is another example about how politics stood in the way of a great film winning the Oscars. I think it deserved it although I haven't seen it's adversary: Rebbecca.",

Any accolade this film recieves is well deserved, whether it's any award nominations and wins and it's status as an American classic.\r\n\r\nThrough this film, we get to take a frightening look at America through the eyes of a naive Oklahoman family. Our heart breaks when these characters go through hard times, and our spirits soar whenever something good happens to them. All of the actors are absolutely amazing in this film. John Ford also did a fantastic job as the director.\r\n\r\nThis movie does the impossible and shows us some of the darkest moments in American history, while at the same time offering the hope of freedom that America offers. We the audience get absolutely captivated by this film, and I was completely drawn in to the film and didn't withdraw until the film was over.\r\n\r\nLike any story that has realism to offer, this movie really doesn't have an ending. It just simply ends. The family has a lot more hardships that are ahead of them, but Ma's speech at the end sums up the spirit of the movie so well that it left me absolutely breathless, and it ended on the perfect note.\r\n\r\nI searched hard and low for a flaw to this movie, and there was absolutley none that I could find. This a beauitful American cinematic masterpiece that gets you emotionally involved with the characters and offers realism unlike any I've ever seen in a film since To Kill a Mockingbird.",

The Grapes of Wrath is adapted from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of same name by John Steinbeck. Renown method-actor Henry Fonda plays Tom Joad, a character we seem to explore to be experiencing harsh mistreatment by authorities under Great-Depression era. Joining his large family. Migrant-workers move out of Oklahoma in search of beginning of new life. Jane Darwell as Ma Joad, has delivered outstanding performance, almost overshadows Henry Fonda's performance. What I simply liked  and enjoyed from the movie, is the way the family embarks upon journey to find prosperous life by working their way out of poverty. Gregg Toland uses excellent use of cinematography, especially from shooting at U.S. Highway 66, till the end almost exhilarating me and making me speechless. James Stewart who was nominated Best Actor for the role in George Cuckor's The Philadelphia Story, who later credited his win to his longtime friend Henry Fonda, siting his performance to be powerful performance.

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath is set in Oklahoma around the thirties, during the dust bowl and the great depression. The film begins with our tale's hero, Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), just being released from jail, and heading home to find his family. Once he gets there he only finds an old beat up house, and he is informed that his family is fixing to leave for California. They all have a happy reunion right before Tom and the rest of the family depart for California; However, once the Joad family reaches California they realize that it may not be near as pleasant as they had imagined, and now they must try and make a living off of very little work. And with things looking bad for the Joad family, having almost no food on the dinner table every night, they will have to do everything they can to just remain alive in these dark times.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grapes of Wrath is one of the greatest, if not greatest, american films ever made. And it is one of my personal favorite films of all time. I have put off reviewing for awhile for whatever reasons, and now I am going to finally write it. The story to this film was for the most part amazing. For those of us that live in today's time, the great depression is only something that we learn about in history books, so for some this film may not be quite as pwerful as it is for others. But for anyone that actually lived in the depression, or has known people that have, it is is easier to understand the importance of this film, and the book by John Steinbeck. It is really sad, but true, that life was once this way, and this is both an educational and meaningful film about how life used to be in America. The Grapes of Wrath, both film and book, truly capture the real horrors of the great depression, and that is one of the reasons I love this film so much. It is as important of a film to this country as To Kill a Mockingbird is, and in my opinion that is saying something. The Grapes of Wrath is hands down for me one of the best film adaptions of a book. I know a lot of these types of fims get critcism for not being like the book, but I feel that even people who enjoyed the book, will also enjoy this film.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeing as The Grapes of Wrath was directing by the great John Ford, I do not think the film's success will come as a surprise to many people. John Ford was one of the finest directors to ever walk this earth, though I don't think you will see him at the top of many people's favorite list, no one can deny some of the great film making he did over his career. He was a brilliant man who had an absolutely brilliant career. And when he filmed The Grapes of Wrath he did one of the most difficult things a director can do, and that is take a book and make a movie out of it. Not only that, but he made it just as good, or better than the book, and that takes talent. John Ford's direction in this film is absolute perfection. He takes what could be a very boring story, about a large counrty family moving to California, and he turns it into what is what I believe to be one of the greatest stories ever told. Filled with some of the best characters in film history. Especially Tom Joad and Ma Joad.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acting was superb. Henry Fonda gives what may be his career performance in this film. He plays the main character in the film, Tom Joad, and he does it perfectly. He may not have won best actor for the performance, but he was still nothing short of excellent. Henry Fonda is one of my all time favorite actors, and he deservedly was given the Honorary Award. Though not to take anything away from his performance, as brilliant as it was Henry Fonda's acting was not my favorite in this film. Jane Darwell stole the show here. She did not have all too great of a career, but I do not think there is another actress in this world that could have played the part of Ma Joad better then Jane Darwell did in this film. It would have been wrong to give anyone else the Oscar. Words cannot describe how meaningful, and incredible her performance was in this film. And really all around everyone did a good job acting in this film.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, The Grapes of Wrath is a true masterpiece. Not many films have been made that I can say I felt were better than this one. This is the true meaning of film making right here. Absolutely perfect acting, it does not get much better than this, and the cast was great as well. I enjoyed everyone's performances in this film, and I can't say that for too many movies, especially nowadays. The direction by John Ford is not to be missed, and as magnificant of a career as he had, The Grapes of Wrath is probably the greatest film he ever released. And even for an old classic the music was actually enjoyable in this film. Movies just do not get much better than this, if you are a movie fan at all, The Grapes of Wrath is for you.",

It's best that the film was made in the more humble days of Hollywood, when actors like Henry Fonda played the characters in the novel, not Hollywood's interpretation of the characters.  Can you imagine if it was made today?  I can just see Sean Penn attempt to play a character of Tom's depth and fail epically.

This classic film follows a family who is forced out of Oklahoma to California to find work as they move from place to place and find nothing but struggles and trouble. It may seem like very little to what the film is about, but the film is very interesting, and I feel it has especially held up well today. At the time, this film well represented the reality of such unfortunate results from the economic depression, while viewing it today it's quite fascinating how well the economy has prospered since, it's like we're looking directly at life as it was 70 years ago. I can't compare it to the novel since I haven't read it, but I can't imagine this film being any better or more faithful to its theme. The cast all play their parts wonderfully, and the film is very well produced for its time. This is an extraordinary classic not only as a film, but also as a highly well written story by John Steinbeck who I know was a great writer in his time (I highly adored his novel Of Mice And Men).",

Thought maaaaybe there'd be an hour and a half when I could watch The General online. Nope. Then I really wanted to take my baby cousin, Carys, to see ...Dragon but timing didnt work out. Although that turned out for the best cause Im gonna get to see it at the IMAX this weekend. Anyhoo, as much as I wanted to just put on something mindless and pass out tonight, I figured that I really gotta get these AFI movies done. I keep missing one arbitrary deadline after another another, and I'm so \\m/ close.\r\n\r\nBefore I get into tonight's movie, I forgot to post this article. It amused me (mostly because it prominently features the word expletive, including the phrase expletive deleted) even if I dont agree with the writer's stance on the subject.\r\n\r\nRight. AFI movie. Tonight's pick was The Grapes of Wrath. I dont know if its cause I didnt do a good job balancing out the movies so Im left with a decent selection, or if Im getting exhausted on the last legs of the project, or if its life in general, but Im finding it more and more difficult to get into these films. Although this time around, I swear I really was trying. And it had me sometimes. But the problem was that its really depressing (and slow) and with everything I've had to deal with lately (still not going into detail), depressing isnt exactly what Im in the mood for.\r\n\r\nI did like the characters. Ma Joad in particular stood out to me, as did the preacher, err former preacher. Also particularly liked that diner scene early on where they're trying to buy food for the trip. Found the way it played out and ultimately concluded very touching. I can see how the film is considered significant in the movie world, but just not quite something I woulda wanted to watch right now if I didnt have a mission to accomplish.\r\n\r\nhttp://expletivedleted.livejournal.com\r\nhttp://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted",

            "content": "The Grapes of Wrath, based on the Pultzer Prize winning novel by John Steinbeck, boasts a powerful performance from Henry Fonda and stylish directing from John Ford, but is very flawed. The films starts with Tom Joad (Fonda), who is released from jail after several years, and arrives at his family's farm to find nobody there. Along with an ex preacher named Jim Casey, Joad finds his family at is uncle's house, preparing to go to California in search of jobs, because the banks had evicted all of the farmers in the Oklahoma from their houses. And so begins one of the greatest American tales of ambition, rebellion, and tragedy. The story is expertly told by John Ford through interesting camera angles and riveting performances, but the script was childlike; because it was incredibly simple, talked down to the audience, and lacked the adequate amount of emotional depth that was needed to carry along the story. Although the theme is timeless, a few scenes are very contemporary and don't sit as well with the rest of the film as they might have in the 1940s. Within these scenes, there are many minor characters that give terrible performances and say useless lines. Despite this, Henry Fonda defines himself flawlessly as the common man: Tom Joad, one of the most iconic figures in film today. Jane Darwell and John Carradine also give tremendous performances. Though it is undoubtedly a true American classic, The Grapes of Wrath falls short of its potential and is scarred by poor writing. 88/100",

            "content": "Read the book before you see the movie.  Read the book even if you never see the movie.  There's no way to capture the pathos and heartbreak of John Steinbeck's novel.  But John Ford makes a reasonable running jump at it in 128 minutes.\n\nThere are some beautiful shots cinematically in this movie.  Long-range shots of individuals against a vast sky frame the movie, and appropriately so, in keeping with a theme of how small man is - whether in contrast with the inexorable pressures of life, at the hands of institutionalized greed, or in terms of character, in perpetrating horrendous cruelty and exploitation against other human beings.   There is also great use of lighting, particulary in regards to the former preacher, Casy (played by John Carradine).  Characters - particularly Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) - move in and out of shadows and darkness throughout the movie, both literally and figuratively.\n\nThere are also some terrible shots that are obviously done on a soundstage (there is actually an echo when the characters speak).  \n\nHenry Fonda gives a great performance, conveying a quiet intensity throughout the film as he seeks to understand the world he has re-entered after four years in prison.  \n\nThe main difficulty is that there is no way that the movie can adequately carry the exposition of the book, much of which is internalized.  Characters that receive a little more treatment in the book are oddly incongruous in the film, coming to the forefront once or twice, ever-present and relatively pointless in the background.  \n\nThe book rails against the exploitation of the poor and disadvantaged 'Okies' - share-croppers in the Midwest, devastated by the massive change in agriculture from small farms to corporate conglomerates, and by the terrible winds that stripped the soil of the midwest and made small-scale farming almost impossible.    One of the interesting things about watching this from Netflix is that the DVD includes two screens of text that preceded the UK-release of the film, and sought to provide a historical context to it for those unfamiliar with the situation in the United States.  \n\nPhilosophically and theologically, the film grapples with the nature of life and changing values in America.  The exploitation of the Okies as they migrate to California is ruthlessly demonstrated, yet still muted compared to the book.  Steinbeck clearly sees the dangerous alliance of industry and government that becomes possible, ensuring the continued suffering and deaths of citizens who have already lost everything, so that they appear to be not even human.  Critical roles are those of Tom Joad, Casy, and Ma Joad.  \n\nTom functions as a sort of Everyman, trying to make sense of things.  He has an idea of how things ought to be or used to be, but is unsure of how to manage the personal and economic transitions and convulsions he is caught in the middle of.  While mankind once fought off wild animals and other people to establish a stake in the world and eke out his daily bread, the poor are faced with a far more menacing foe now.  An enemy that has no body, but is rather a corporate entity.  There's no one enemy to face down or kill - only the relentless, grinding machinations of industry.  You can kill the parts, but the parts are replaceable.  \n\nCasy is an interesting character.  He's a former preacher who baptized Tom as a young boy, but Casy has now \"lost the Spirit\", and can't preach any longer.  He was and is haunted by the demons he has personally battled and often lost to.  But he's seeking truth.  He functions as a seer of sorts in the novel/movie, affirming the truth of what various characters express as they cross the Joad's path.  And he ultimately 'sees the light', so to speak, in California, as he finds himself able to once again champion truth and rightness - a role that, like the Savior he once served, gets him killed.\n\nMa Joad is the family glue.  She holds the family together with her strength and determination.  Where the men become disoriented as their roles in society are destroyed (bread-winner, provider), she steps into the gap their absent leadership creates, focusing on maintaining the family.  But it's more than even her considerable strength can accomplish.  The land formed a \"boundary\" that helped her create stability and enforce the routine and traditions that bind a family together.  But without the land and that objective focus, there's no way to keep the family together.  They fragment, lost in doubt and disappointment, felled by heartache and loss, scattered by their rage against the faceless, disembodied oppressiveness of a brutally capitalistic society. \n\nTom leaves in search of truth, both to find it for himself and to share it with others.  We may work to feed ourselves, but if we don't have a central truth to provide the grounding for our lives, even full stomachs ultimately aren't enough to keep a person going.\n\nThe brutality of  this movie & book is driven home all the more by realizing that this occurred within living memory.  There are people who remember the Depression, who lived through it and bear witness to it.  And it happened here - in America.  Important lessons to keep in mind when we try to fool ourselves into thinking that such abuses 'can't happen here', or that we've evolved beyond such responses.  It could happen here - to you, to me.  And how we respond to such a situation, and what role we take up within it, may be guided in large part by how diligently we have sought truth, and how tenaciously we hold on to it as the defining aspect of our lives, rather than visa versa.",

Tons has been said about the film itself, it's stars, director John Ford and of course based on the gripping novel by John Steinbeck, what I found surprising is the 2007 Fox DVD release's DVD commentary track with John Ford historian: Joesph McBride and Steinbeck Historian: Susan Shillinglaw. How many times have you ever heard respectful disagreement about men's motivations as artists. These 2 really know thier stuff and between them they give a lot of detail on the men and the days they lived in. Ford & Steinbeck both came from everyday man backgrounds and were both adamant Anti-communist liberals who because of thier works highlighting the battles of the common man against a rich ownership society (especialy this film & book) were accussed of being COMMUNISTS of all things. These accusations were made by powerful California Farming/ Banks monetary forces who stood a lot to loose money wise by the exposure of the unsafe farm housing conditions, poverty and indebited servitude that the low wages forced upon thousands of migrant dust bowl American farm workers and thier families. Both men were American Patriots. Ford served in the OSS in WW2 and made frontline combat films for the military and Steinbeck served as a war correpondent in WW2 and later in Vietnam.

The old-timeyness was also funny to me, probably not intended.  How at the dance they play the same 30 seconds of \"coming round the mountain\" for about 10 minutes.  Or when the Grandma dies and is asking for Grandpa....didn't Grandpa have a first name?  \n\nAnyways, it did give some insight into a side of the Great Depression you don't see very often.  Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell are good in it.",

Even though these are fictional people they are so broadly written that it feels as though they are real. What I was most amazed by in this movie is that these people try to \"make it\" by being honest. I also liked how they showed how the common man was brow-beaten by the state authorities. The poor were barely given a chance at this time and it's amazing people survived at all. It's not surprising that force was used and necessary to provoke change from the government.",

The slow and extremely painful collapse of the deeply complex, lovable, pitiful yet admirable Joad family was so saddening and strangely so uplifting at the same time, that in my mind the Great Depression, actually the entire country I live in, IS that book. Truly a difficult story to capture on film, I thought. \r\n\r\nBut, several years later, I decided to give the very famous movie version a shot, just to see if it was half as good as the book. To my suprise, the film doesn't compare with the book, but instead adds a whole new element to the vivid image of 1930s America started by John Steinbeck. Somehow, while telling almost the same story, the film finishes the book, and completes the portrait of the deeply complex Joad family. Henry Fonda is otherwordly as Tom Joad, and Jane Darwell holds her own right beside his legendary performance with her own of Ma. What was most enjoyable though, was the short, but extremely memorable appearances of characters like Grandpa, the former preacher, and the (not so) crazy man who explains that a man owns land when he's born and dies on it, not when he owns some piece of paper saying he does. It's these performances that are special and they all come together to make a truly beautiful film. A must see.",

I am a big fan of John Stienbeck and thought the movie portrayed everything that was great about the book (of course some things are going to be lost, but you remember the size of that book). Again, I also think the cinematography was one of the main reasons I enjoyed this film so much. It really pulled me into the story that much more.
