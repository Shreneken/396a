    "summary": "Alfred Kralik (James Stewart) and Klara Novak (Margaret Sullavan) are employees at Matuschek and Company, a general store in Budapest. Klara and Alfred are constantly at odds with each other, butting heads and disagreeing on almost everything. Both are enamored of their respective pen pals, who serve as welcome distractions in their lives. Little do they know, they are each the other's pen pal and, despite outward differences, have unwittingly fallen in love through their letters.",

While the film had decent acting by James Stewart and Frank Morgan, the film was dragged by Margaret Sullavan's wooden acting abilities. Despite the film's writing by Samson Raphaelson was clever, the film wasn't really funny. The Shop Around the Corner may be a pleasant film to those who are very fond of the romantic-comedy genre but for anyone else, it's just your average film about anonymous romance during the holiday season.",

            "content": "\"Didn't he impress you as being rather witty?\"\n\"Well he struck me as rather depressed.\" \nJimmy Stewart throwing a punch at a solid 75% of film reviewers. \n\nA cute and charming script that was among the first to really take advantage of a pair of leads that could level snide remarks just as well as they could make doe eyes at one another. Despite the inherent humor and sweetness in the premise of two people that are falling for one another without realizing it, The Shop Around the Corner touches on surprisingly dark territory - infidelity, grief, and suicide, to name a few - all while dedicating a surprising proportion of its runtime to the operation of the titular shop. And yet, it strangely works, benefiting from the added characterization, the authenticity imparted from the daily bickering, and the eventual triumph of happy sentiments over the persistent conflict and chaos of daily life at Matuschek and Company. I'm not sure I personally enjoyed it quite as much as films with a similar frenemies dynamic of the period (particularly It Happened One Night), but it is still very solid and worthy of a watch mostly for the great back and forth between Sullavan and Stewart, perhaps slightly less so for the Capra-esque/Dickensian subplots. (3.5/5)",

But the central relationship between Klara and Alfred is a bit lackluster, something You've Got Mail would later get right. There's not enough budding romance before Klara suddenly reveals she had a thing for Alfred the whole time; she never showed a hint of it. She's not lovable either, so it's not a good look for a figure like Jimmy Stewart to throw himself at an uninterested woman. Despite this, supporting characters create a wonderful, vibrant energy, and there's so much funny wit that's well performed that even a problem as central as the key relationship is forgivable.",

The movie ends wrapping up all loose ties. I fully enjoyed this light-hearted, easy watching classic from the 40s.\n\nSetting is 75% within the shop, 10% outside of the store front, and 15% elsewhere in town. In this aspect, it's easy to watch, but knocking down a star due to the simplicity.",

            "content": "I've seen the musical version of Ernst Lubitsch's black-and-white classic (\u2018She Loves Me') and of course the rom-com remake (\u2018You've Got Mail') but it is only now that I get the chance to be cinematically educated with the original and despite its often corny and antiquated attitudes, there's just no denying the gentle yet glorious innocence and charm this film is bursting with and its ability to melt the meanest and hardest of hearts especially during this festive season. Effortlessly directed by Lubitsch, it's set in Budapest (where all signs are in Hungarian but everyone's speaking in English of course) as a result of its source material (a play by Miklos Laszlo), and revolves around the employees of Matuschek & Co., the titular shop around the corner. Interestingly, I find the father-and-son-esque relationship between the owner, the wonderful Frank Morgan's Hugo Matuschek and his longest serving employee, Alfred Kralik, played by a very young James Stewart (who then only takes second billing) more compelling than the romantic subplot between Kralik and Margaret Sullavan's Klara, who unbeknown to each other were secret pen-pals before they became bickering co-workers. What surprise me most is how much the rom-com was amplified in the 1998 remake compared to the original; while a passing reference to ungentlemanly behaviour in the stock room sadly still rings as true today as it did 80 years ago. If some of the comedy feels a little dated, the alluringly witty dialogue can still manage to liven things up. In this strange and bothersome year, this Christmas classic is perhaps the exact escapist tonic we all need to bring a little joy and Christmas cheer to our lives, even if it is over-idealistic poppycock.",

            "content": "The strength of The Shop Around the Corner is in the cast and the characters they create. The gift shop is full of a unique group of employees that each have fun mannerisms and personalities that make it feel like a charming place I\u2019d like to visit. I couldn\u2019t figure out why the film took place in Budapest, since almost everyone in it is American and it never feels like they are in Hungary, but that is an unimportant detail that they mentioned at the beginning and I quickly forgot about. I found the mystery of the film to be quite interesting, so I had fun trying to figure out why Mr. Matuschek was angry with Kralik. You could sense the history in their relationship, and it made me instantly curious what made it break down. When we discover the truth, it then seemed somewhat obvious what was really going on, but they avoid revealing everything long enough for me to puzzle through the questions that the story was raising. However, since that was the aspect of the film I latched onto, it didn\u2019t feel all that comedic. This part of the film is a relatively dark story, and even when good things happen it\u2019s in the wake of some depressing details. What I think they want you to focus on is the love story, which I knew about before watching. I think The Shop Around the Corner suffered from the fact that I have seen You\u2019ve Got Mail many times before and that film took the concept of this romance and made it work much better. In comparison, this romance felt almost like an afterthought. Many of the times the letters were mentioned it was in passing while a number of much more important stories were going on. I also didn\u2019t feel like there was a strong animosity between the two leads, which is necessary to pull off the story they are trying to tell. However, it was nice to see some of the scenes that You\u2019ve Got Mail copied from this one. It triggered some fond memories and made me want to watch that movie again soon. I feel like I\u2019m being a bit harsh when I write about The Shop Around the Corner, but I think it\u2019s the comparison that hurt it. If I watched this movie in a vacuum prior to ever seeing the remake, then I think it would have charmed me a lot. It\u2019s a nice film that I found pleasant to watch, and one I\u2019ll probably seek out again someday.",

            "content": "A film with many layers and a joy to watch, it\u00e2(TM)s a real triumph for director Ernst Lubitsch.  He gives us a romantic comedy in which the romance is just a part of a larger canvas, one that touches us in so many ways: the loneliness of the holiday season, the humiliation of betrayal, needing to endure other people and the boss at one\u00e2(TM)s workplace to support a family, and of course, an unlikely love that only comes from scratching beneath the surface.  \n\nLubitsch is so complete in the way he tells this story, and yet seems to tread lightly as he does so.  He fleshes out his characters in the simplest of ways, with little gestures and comments.  He exercises the deftness of restraint in all things, from the slyness of his comedy to letting silence and his actors\u00e2(TM) faces say it all when appropriate.  He gives us a rich symphony of human emotions, showing us human dignity and the angels of our better natures, but also our pettiness, jealousy, vanity, and disdain.  In love, he shows us the importance of inner character but also acknowledges physical appeal.  In community, he gives us a sense of comradeship, but also the inevitable pecking order and little rivalries.  There is real wisdom in his observations of how people behave, but also a philosophical acceptance and elegant refinement in how he presents it.  He always seems to thread the needle, and maybe that\u00e2(TM)s the essence of what the \u00e2~Lubitsch touch\u00e2(TM) is all about.\n\nOne theme in the film is how people communicate, and the need to be honest and yet graceful.  We see this in how one salesman (Jimmy Stewart) talks to the boss (Frank Morgan) contrasted to the way another does (Joseph Schildkraut), a guy who sucks up and is an example of grace without truth.  We also see it in how Stewart and the new saleswoman (Margaret Sullavan) antagonize each another, never giving one another the benefit of the doubt, and often being forthright but lacking grace.  They are of course much more eloquent and kind to one another as anonymous pen-pals, and it shows us how much our openness and attitude towards someone else shapes our view of them.\n\nThe cast is fantastic, led by excellent performances from Morgan and Stewart.  Felix Bressart as the family man and William Tracy as the errand boy stand out in supporting roles.  I wasn\u00e2(TM)t as wild about Margaret Sullavan, but she fits the part quite well.  The scene she has with Stewart in the caf\u00c3 (C) is wonderfully acerbic, and is preceded by Bressart pointing out just who has the copy of Anna Karenina with the red carnation in a clever way.  Another great scene is Stewart\u00e2(TM)s dismissal, which is one he and Lubitsch both execute as true masters.  I also loved that moment Frank Morgan has with the new errand boy after seeking someone to go to dinner with.  \n\nThere is such a genuine feeling to this film, where Lubitsch really takes us into the world of this little shop.  As in life, there is despair, humiliation, and bickering, just as there is warmth, friendship, and higher love.  This is an old film to seek out.",

            "content": "Shop Around The Corner (1940) Is based upon the play \"Parfumerie\"\n\nA film where you really need to be able to follow the dialog and who is speaking to who and what. The other thing is the body language with the micro expressions on the actors faces. I think that this is one of the better acting films. \n\nI saw this a second time and the story made much more sense because I knew what to look for in the other character while the other was saying the dialog. \n\nWhat I find interesting is how a key figure to this story is in an affair with one of the characters in the film that is never seen but only referred to by other characters or on the phone. Not much is seen from that particular character as a sign of a relationship but just small hints. \n\nI think the costumes stand out in this film. It is obvious to me that each costume choice perfectly fits the character they are portraying. \n\nI think one of the major stand out characters in this film was Pepi Katona. I like Mr. Pepi Katona in his lines and way he speaks. Pepi almost stole the film by his performance even though we see so little of his character in the film. His character changed drastically when he went from errand messenger to a clerk. I even liked how Pepi's voice and tone changed on the phone as he talked to different characters. Even Pepi's clothes and how he presented himself to others changes in this film as we presents himself to others as different characters. \n\nI liked the scene where Pirovitch is looking through the window of the caf\u00c3 (C) to see who is the girl to Alfred. I enjoy the scene because in it we never see the girl. The scene is purely driven by dialog and what the listeners reactions are to the speaker yet we understand or get a mental picture of what the other sees. Because we don't see the girl and we only can infer what is happening and going on based upon the dialog and reactions. \n\nI like Jimmy Stewarts acting in this film. Just by his body language, facial language he is able to convey a lot in this film about what he really is thinking without necessarily saying anything.\n\n\nI also like the loyalty and character of Pirovitch.\n\nWhat gets me about this film is how it mostly takes place at the shop but never felt bird staying in one location. This film is mostly driven by the performances.",

Instead subplots of infidelity and a failing business cloud whatever romantic juice can be squeezed out of the primary plotline.  The film is not boring nor are the characters bland, but the heavy air of the Hungarian milieu and the heavier subplots bring the story to a slow climb toward nothing interesting.\nOverall, I suspect the modern You've Got Mail might have a better tone but less substance, and as a whole, this story feels too uneven.",

This movie was fairly simple and straight-forward, no unnecessary characters or sub-plots but it was a little corny and na\u00efve, but that's a reflection of the times. I love Jimmy Stewart (who plays Alfred Kralik), he's so adorable and he has good chemistry with Margaret Sullavan (Klara Novak).

            "content": "While this wouldn't quite make it as one of my favorite Jimmy Stewart movies, it's still a classic well worth seeing. It's an original and clever romantic story, which later inspired the movie You've Got Mail (which I still haven't seen, somehow). It's not as much of a comedy as I went in thinking it would be, but it still works really well as a more straightforward romance. It's also got a great group of side characters, the sort you never really get in movies these days.\n\nThe story, which is set in Budapest - most probably only because the original stage play was Hungarian - follows two clerks working together in a shop: Alfred (Stewart), a longtime salesman, and Klara (Margaret Sullavan), the new hire. By day, they disagree about things and snipe at each other, but at night they each go home and engage in passionate romances-by-mail. What neither realizes is that the love letters they've been writing have in fact been written to each other. You can imagine how the movie goes from there.\n\nJimmy Stewart is, well, Jimmy Stewart here, as he is in every movie; but he's perhaps a little less Jimmy Stewart-y than usual. The character isn't quite rounded out with the same \"aw shucks\" likability I usually associate with Stewart; we almost never see him except at work, and I actually found his behavior towards the end of the movie almost a little cruel. I realize the movie's over as soon as the secret is out, but I felt like it would have been more fun to watch them deal in greater depth with the revelation, rather than having the revelation instantly solve everything. Margaret Sullavan is terrific as Klara; it's really something to watch her not know the secret when we in the audience do. The supporting players are strong too, especially Frank Morgan as the gruff but well-meaning shop owner Mr. Matuschek.\n\nThe movie was directed by Ernst Lubitsch, a German emigre who became quite well-respected in Hollywood. Somehow this was the first movie I've seen by Lubitsch. As was the case with many great classical Hollywood directors, there's no obvious personal style, and yet the film is immaculately directed. Those old-timers were real professionals. Like I said, I expected the film to have more humor, and I was a little baffled by some of the Stewart character's behavior late in the film. But overall it's still quite a fine movie.",

An ingenious script renders a witty plot set-up which only leaves our leading lady unwittingly snared inside a white lie while audiences' appetite has been fully whetted and the final revelation is well-anticipated, humorous, affecting and sincerely good-natured, this is \"the\" kind of film which Hollywood doesn't (or is unable to) produce any more, pitifully!\n\nThe temperaments of the two leads are plain congenial and mutually harmonious, the James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan pair oozes the optimal chemistry in the conventional rom-com mis-matched setting. The two represents the quintessential precious nature of the two sexes, role models of the golden age and rarely can be found in reality now, it all reminds us nostalgically what a pure golden-heart could be and elicits more whole-hearted appreciation. Stewart would win his Oscar for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY (1940, 8/10) the same year, but under Lubistch's guidance, his slightly reserved suaveness and gentleman-like diffidence achieve an irresistible personal debonair which also is difficult to find at present. Sullavan, not quite a household name but in this film, her performance is exquisite, heartwarming, say, the ending, when she finally gets to know the man of her dream is her bickering partner in the shop, her psychologically-shocking-but-exhilaratingly-content transition is the killing of the film and saves the film from being an emotional overkill or worse, a stroke of bathos. \n\nFrank Morgan (afresh from THE WIZARD OF OZ 1939, 8/10) and Joseph Schildkraut both deliver excellent work as the credulous but kind-hearted shop owner and the sycophantic poseur in the shop respectively, pristine frills added to the main storyline. \n\n THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, is a rare gem of its own kind, I highly doubt Lubitsch could excel himself in his canon, where I will burrow and wish me luck!",

There are also subplots revolve around the harmonious working relationships at the shop. \n\nIt doesn't strike me as a memorable movie but I like its heartwarming humanity. It is a perfect movie to watch late at night and then go to bed with a smile. \n\nRating: B",
