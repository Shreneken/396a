    "summary": "This classic romantic comedy focuses on Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn), a Philadelphia socialite who has split from her husband, C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), due both to his drinking and to her overly demanding nature. As Tracy prepares to wed the wealthy George Kittredge (John Howard), she crosses paths with both Dexter and prying reporter Macaulay Connor (James Stewart). Unclear about her feelings for all three men, Tracy must decide whom she truly loves.",

Grant is charming as all get-out, Hepburn brings a sharp wit to stage a career resurgence, Stewart is characteristically wholesome, and Hussey leads the supporting cast with a memorably barbed and aloof peformance that earned her an Oscar nom despite her relatively brief appearance. That said, it's got some weaknesses; parts of the romantic dynamic are woefully dated, and some aspects of the plot are a bit convoluted for their own good (the switched identities, for one). As far as I'm concerned, nothing can take the crown from Capra's It Happened One Night and the pure chemistry between Gable and Colbert for the top pre-war rom-com, but The Philadelphia Story is still a memorable and above all well-acted standout of the genre.

            "content": "Playing possibly the most quintessential Katharine Hepburn role of her career one of the most famous actresses of all time gives an iconic performance in a role that feels tailor made for her. She is the primary selling point of the film and I couldn't help loving her but the film boasts many other charms. However much like another Hepburn classic, Woman of the Year (1942), it really botches it's ending as it cuts down what would have been a great feminist tale. Is it one of the 100 greatest films ever made? No, not at all but it is a fun romantic comedy that is likely to appeal to all audiences, young and old.\n\nPhiladelphian socialite and tabloid fixture Tracy Lord, Katharine Hepburn, has been divorced from her alcoholic ex-husband C.K. Dexter Haven, Cary Grant, for two years and plans to wed the self made but dispassionate Geoge Kittredge, John Howard. Haven arranges to have disgruntled reporter Mike Connor, James Stewart, and his co-worker Elizabeth Imbrie, Ruth Hussey, cover the wedding under the guise of being his close friends. Lord figures out this deception quickly and chooses to present herself a certain way so that the articles covering her will be positive. Her aggression when it comes to her relationships with men proves to be derived from her father Seth, John Halliday, having publicly had many affairs that have hurt her mother and brought shame upon the family. She begins falling in love with the goofy Connor but Imbrie harbors an attraction to him and the passion is clearly still alive between Lord and Haven. She comes to regret some of her past actions and is humbled as the men around her inform her of the pain she has caused and ultimately calls of her wedding to Kittredge and remarries Haven.\n\nDescribing the wonder of Hepburn's work is difficult because to most it may seem as though she is just playing herself. I would contend that she does play on the public persona she has built up but injects a vulnerability into her portrayal that wasn't there in previous Hepburn vehicles. Probably driven by the fact that she was making a comeback and had been rejected by Hollywood she is a woman of great talents forced to admit her flaws. She also displays her tremendous comic timing as few actresses can enunciate as well as she can and simply a repetition of the word \"Swim\" elicits great laughter. Her damaged, wounded pride shines through when she is attacked by her father, a character that the film likes but I hated, and her torture at seeing her mother, whom she tenderly cares for, become subservient to him. We are as enchanted by her as all of her male suitors are as she is a queen and a goddess in equal measure.\n\nStewart is quite lovely as the daffy competition to her ex-husband and it is easy to see why he became the leading man of the 1940s. He has great chemistry with Hepburn and the two radiate sexuality during the famous drunk sequence in the film but I imagine that few actors could have made this odd little writer quite so appealing. Grant is a bit of a letdown, as he often is for me, with his love interest seeming stolid and dull and he is easily overshadowed by supporting players like Hussey who has one of the best moments in the entire film when she notes that Connor has some growing up to do before he is good enough to be with her. \n\nWhere the film lost me was in it's ending as the ideas that I believed it was supporting and it's presentation of the strong, capable Lord are suddenly subverted to damning effect. Her father has a horrifying monologue in which he blames his daughter and wife for his infidelity and suggests that only a meek, subservient daughter will do. I was disgusted by this and I believed that the film was too but Lord later apologizes to her father, for what I do not know, and returns to Haven who has very obvious problems in being an alcoholic that justify her divorcing him. I understand that under the Hays Code you couldn't portray divorce positively and a comedy of remarriage was a way to get around certain restrictions but they did not have to hammer home the sexist ideas so heavily.",

Crazy to think that as late as the 1940's, American movies were not permitted to depict extramarital affairs.  My how times have changed.  It's also noteworthy that Katherine Hepburn's character being aggressively pushed in the face to the ground by her husband is actually a comedic point of reference.  Yikes.  Those \"that's how it was then\" observances aside, The Philadelphia Story is a thoroughly pleasant viewing experience.  \n\nJimmy Stewart's only Oscar-winning performance is a hoot, displaying a range of emotion from disdain to goofy, but in a likable manner all his own.  After a successful Broadway run in the same role, Hepburn is sharp as Tracy Lord, a wealthy socialite that learns love isn't about being worshipped, it's about opening up.  As her wedding day approaches, pesky Mike Connor (Stewart) and Ruth Hussey (wonderful as Liz Imbrie) track her every move for an unwelcome tabloid spread.  And C.K. Dexter Haven (Grant) finds joy in stirring the emotional pot.  \n\nIt's at once old-fashioned but also feels fresh, given Donald Ogden Stewart's Academy Award winning script.  A mash-up of romantic comedy tropes of the past, with a dash of what they would become in the future.  Both staid and playful, in an envelope-pushing way for the time period.

            "content": "One of the things I love most about the Criterion Collection is how it provides the means and reasonable excuse to take a respite from the blockbusters that dominate popular culture. Their commitment to providing the discerning cinephile with examples of the most illuminating and enjoyable examples of cinema as a creative means of artistic expression. From the classic film presentation of the genic embodied by the works of William Shakespeare to the definitive gangster movies of the forties and creature flicks of the fifties, the Criterion Collection has continually stood out as a place to enjoy the creativity of the best auteurs whoever peered through a lens. Frequently. When I receive a new member of the illustrious list for review, it is a film I may not have seen for many years if ever at all. Most recently this was the case with 'The Philadelphia Story.' Released in 1940 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), it was a part of Hollywood's contribution to the war effort. Film at that time played he invaluable service of helping to keep morale up, and people hopeful. Typically, this was done in one of two ways. Dramas, mysteries, and thrillers reinforced the jingoistic confidence that our morally right cause will prevail. The popular alternative was to offer a distraction from rationing, battles occupying headlines on every newspaper and radio broadcast. This movie possesses a timeless quality that is derived from superior writing, exemplary direction, and performances from a cast of iconic performers. It will be of interest to fans of that most popular of date movies, the romantic comedy. Aficionados of the rom-com are certain to be fascinated by comparing a rom-com with modern stars, for example, Katherine Heigl and an actress from the golden age of Hollywood, Katharine Hepburn. Among the most obvious differences is that Ms. Hepburn was accomplished in a broad variety of genres. She is just one member of an amazing actor, each one worthy of their A-List status.\n\nThe Lord family has held a prominent position in Philadelphia society for as far back as that illustrious lineage extended. The eldest daughter Tracy (Katharine Hepburn)), had been married to wealthy yacht designer, C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant). Although he was on par socially, the marriage encountered irreconcilable differences and the couple divorced. Younger members of the audience are admonished to keep in mind that at that time divorce was infrequent and had serious, negative social stigma associated. The extreme action was undertaken as C.K. was unable to maintain the exacting standards of conduct demanded by the Lord family. He had a penchant for a drink which was exacerbated by the family's constant pressure to quit. After permitting a suitable couple of years to pass Tracy was engaged to George Kittredge (John Howard). A match was technically suitable as George did come from an affluent family, but it was tainted but the social faux pas of being nouveau riche and being popular among the common throng. True wealth, derived from money inherited through generations, never lowered themselves to associate with the lower caste. The need to be explicated stated wasn't necessary, but the audience would understand that a divorced woman would be unsuitable for the most desirable young men topping the social register. Still, George's popularity with the people was certain to turn the nuptials into a media circus.\n\n'Entertainment news' and paparazzi are now a new contrivance, they have existed for as long as one group of people were held in higher esteem and bestowed with elevated social status. If this story were told today, the next player in the tale would be held by TMZ or 'E! News'. In the forties, the primary source of innuendo, rumors, blind headlines, and gossip were the Hollywood fan magazines. The commitment to journalistic integrity and the veracity of their sources were secondary to obtaining the scoop and increasing distribution. The dubious representative of the fourth estate in this story is a gossip magazine Spy. Its publisher, Sidney Kidd (Henry Daniell), is anxious beat out the competition by securing the location and other details of the pending nuptials. To this end, he assigns reporter Macaulay \"Mike\" Connor (James Stewart) and photographer Liz Imbrie (Ruth Hussey). The requisite twist that drives the confusion of the genre, the secret identity reveal, mistaking one individual for another, to a contrived plot to purposely deceive. The chosen plot contrivance utilized here is the unknown job. When a character is engaged in a job or career that potentially compromises the core relationship.\n\nAs George is from new money, he was still in need of a job, if not for the essentials of life than for something to occupy the endless hours of prosperous tedium. He had been working for Spy in South America and is to introduce Mike and Liz into the venue. Many movie genres have undergone some changes in the defining criteria, but the venerable romantic comedy has endured largely unaltered. The fundamental formula is bringing the couple together, induce the same relationship threatening stressor or deception and pull them back together. This movie initially premiered over seventy-five years ago. The romcoms enjoyed when this audience's grand or even great grandparents were dating. Terms such as iconic are tossed about, but not many categories of the film were so well defined three-quarters of a century ago. The plot concocted by George is to introduce Mike and Liz as friends of Tracy's brother Junius, who is a U.S. diplomat in Argentina. Tracy expresses her refusal to be complicit. George threatens to release a salacious story exposing her father, Seth's (John Halliday), affair with a dancer. His cheating, while not publicly known, had been the cause of Tracy's parents sleeping in different bedrooms.In the current proliferation of divorce much of the stigma has been ameliorated, but in the forties, u=it was admitting to an intrinsic failure often perceived as a character flaw. For the social elite, it was certain to diminish the family ranking considerably. What is fascinating, from the vantage point of a new millennium, is to examine how its possible to present so many identical tropes, circumstances, and archetypes with the context of such dissimilar societal norms and moral restrictions. Arguably a case can be made the romantic comedy is firmly based on the inherent facets of human nature that it can resist the vagaries of changes in social structure over long periods of time. Tracy relents allowing the reporter and photographer to remain.\n\nRight on cue, the audience is pulled into cinematic geometry as the sides of the mandatory romantic triangle is formed. Tracy discovers a book of short stories written by Mike finder herself enamored by him. On the night before the ceremony Tracy gets drunk, only the second time she has been in a state of inebriation. The diminished self-control resulted in a midnight swim with Mike. A modern romcom, even one with a mild rating of PG-13, would inevitably be highly suggestive of some inappropriate state of undress. This is one aspect of movies that have suffered from the greater contextual freedom. With the strict Hayes Code of 1930 in full effect, even the hint of such impropriety was unthinkable. The filmmaker had to be cleaver in getting adult themes across to the audience while eschewing any hint of adult content. The director of the perennial classic was George Cukor, the master of movie romance in its multitude of forms. Besides the comedic format Mr. Cukor made his mark in the romantic drama, 'A Star is Born (1954) and the musical, 'My Fair Lady (1964). He received five Academy Award nominations over the course of his career winning Best Director for 'My Fair Lady.' The romantic comedy may currently be considered on a lower tier than other movies, but a film like this provide proof of their lasting contribution to the art form.\nbullet\tNew 4K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack\nbullet\tAudio commentary from 2005 featuring film scholar Jeanine Basinger\nbullet\tNew introduction to actor Katharine Hepburn s role in the development of the film by documentarians David Heeley and Joan Kramer\nbullet\tIn Search of Tracy Lord, a new documentary about the origin of the character and her social milieu\nbullet\tTwo full episodes of The Dick Cavett Show from 1973, featuring rare interviews with Hepburn, plus an excerpt of a 1978 interview from that show with director George Cukor\nbullet\tLux Radio Theatre adaptation of the film from 1943, featuring an introduction by filmmaker Cecil B.

            "content": "The Philadelphia Story Review\n\tThe Philadelphia Story is a brilliant rom com. It's smart, funny, emotional, romantic and so much more. Much of this comes from its brilliant screenplay (its Oscar win was well deserved) and the actors who make it come to life. The story is a creative twist on classic tropes (for example, rather than a love triangle it has an odd love polygon, featuring three potential suitors competing for Katharine Hepburn's Tracy Lord and a sub-triangle surrounding James Stewart's Macaulay Connors), the dialogue is clever and witty, and the humor works extremely well. It is a wild, fast-paced joyride of a film, but it manages to never get the audience lost along the way, even through multiple faked identities and misunderstandings among the characters. \n\tMuch of the credit for the success of The Philadelphia Story goes to the actors. Its central figures are played Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, and Cary Grant, all undeniable titans of filmmaking. The manic pacing of the film presents a challenge to these actors, as they need to be over the top to meet the demands of the script, but going too far makes the film hokey and unbelieveable. Luckily, the film delivers on the promise of its billing, with each of the three leads delivering a stellar performance. The film is also stocked with scene stealing supporting players such as Ruth Hussey, Roland Young, and Virginia Weidler, each one adding to the merits of an already excellent film.\n\tThe Philadelphia Story fits into a number of subgenres. While it is most associated the remarriage subgenre, in which a divorced couple rediscovers love, much to the chagrin of their current romantic partners (ex. His Girl Friday), but it also fits into the wedding subgenre in which one of the romantic leads is about to get married to another person and the other lead has to break up the wedding (ex.  The Wedding Singer, Made of Honor), and the journalism subgenre, in which one of the romantic leads is tasked with writing a story about the other and in doing so falls in love (ex. It Happened One Night, 27 Dresses). Ultimately, this subgenre transcendence reflects one of the more fascinating traits of The Philadelphia Story: it is a conglomeration of a number of classic rom com themes. It explores the relationship between social class and romance, definitions of manhood and masculinity, the validity of marriage, and female sexual agency, to name a few. Dealing with so many issues often could dilute each of them; however, the confused and manic nature of the film makes this compounded exploration of issues successful. The hectic pace implies that all of these anxieties coming up at once is in itself an anxiety unto itself.\n\tTo the extent that The Philadelphia Story doesn't get the attention it deserves, it can only be attributed to the fact that it is often overshadowed by its central player's other output. Each of the three leads was incredibly successful both before and after The Philadelphia Story, collectively appearing in films such on the level of Bringing up Baby, His Girl Friday, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life, Vertigo, North by Northwest, and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, to only name films from the top of my head. However, The Philadelphia Story is a phenomenal achievement and not one to be missed.",

            "content": "What a delightful movie this is - loaded with star power, clever dialog, and a script that keeps us guessing.  The first scene, where Cary Grant is shown leaving his wife Katharine Hepburn with no words spoken, sets the tone.  As Hepburn plans to remarry, Grant seeks to get revenge on her by sneaking a reporter (Jimmy Stewart) and photographer (Ruth Hussey) into her home on the wedding weekend.  \n\nStewart is brilliant in the role from beginning to end.  He's upset over being there in the first place, as he's a serious writer who has been asked to write a trashy tabloid story, and he's not a big fan of the well-to-do either.  The scene early on where he examines the silver, thinking he's alone, and is confronted by the butler, is hilarious.  Later he dials up another room within the home at random and says \"This is the bridal suite, would you send up a couple of caviar sandwiches and a bottle of beer?\"  When asked who he is, he then says \"This is the voice of Doom calling.  Your days are numbered 'til the seventh son of the seventh son,\" before hanging up.  He has other comic scenes early on, including asking the librarian \"Dost thou have a washroom?\" after sensing her formality.\n\nI just loved how the film wrong foots us, as we expect it to go in a direction of these two being undercover spies with all sorts of similar antics throughout the weekend.  Instead, Hepburn immediately sees through the ruse, and proceeds to hilariously torture the pair with questions of her own.  Along the way an uncle will be assigned the identity of the father, only to have the father show up unexpectedly himself.  Hepburn's much younger little sister (Virginia Weidler) is part of the fun, at one point going up to the piano with a gleam in her eye, and busting out a raucous tune: \"Lydia, oh Lydia, say have you met Lydia?  Oh Lydia, the tattooed lady.   She has eyes that folks adore so, and a torso even more so...\"\n\nThroughout all this madcap chaos, the script is fast-paced and clever.  For example, in response to her mother asking if there's no privacy anymore, Hepburn quips, \"Only in bed, mother, and not always there.\"  I also loved it when she referred to the poet Li Bai at one point: \"There was a Chinese poet who was drowned while trying to kiss the moon in the river.  He was drunk....but he wrote beautiful poetry.\"  More importantly, there are observations on character and love.  The father (John Halliday) tries to explain an older man's attraction to a younger woman, and even though he seems like a rake, there's something to what he says.  The film takes a serious turn when he and Grant both say some devastating things to Hepburn about her insensitivity, and the hurt in her reaction shows her acting prowess.  \n\nWith all of that said, I think it was really Jimmy Stewart who really made this movie special with two wonderful scenes.  The first is where he's drunk and goes over to Grant's place, which is an absolute classic.  The scene was unrehearsed, what we see was the first take, and it includes a couple of improvisations - Stewart hiccupping, and Grant quipping \"Excuse me.\"  The look in Stewart's eyes really make us feel that he's drunk, and that we're getting a glimpse at two friends (the actors themselves) having fun.  In fact, the way Stewart looks at people throughout the movie - the butler, the librarian, Grant, and Hepburn - is just fantastic, and still makes me smile thinking about it.\n\nThe second amazing scene is when he and Hepburn (who's also drunk) realize they're in love.  \"A magnificence that comes out of your eyes, in your voice, in the way you stand there, in the way you walk. You're lit from within, Tracy. You've got fires banked down in you, hearth-fires and holocausts,\" he says.  She answers, \"I don't seem to you made of bronze?\", a reference to one of the cruel things that's been said to her, and he responds, \"No, you're made out of flesh and blood. That's the blank, unholy surprise of it. You're the golden girl, Tracy. Full of life and warmth and delight...\".  When he kisses her, she emits a beautiful \"golly,\" and later, before they dash off across the lawn, she says \"put me in your pocket, Mike.\"  It's a wonderful, romantic scene.  Oh, and I should say, the lines they say to each other earlier in the evening - \"Hello you... You look fine\", \"I feel fine\" are just lovely too. \n\nIt's for that reason that I have to say, I was a bit disappointed in Hepburn's choice at the end.  The evening before she does say \"The time to make up your mind about people is never\", and it is in the spirit of a reconciliation which grows, but just doesn't feel right.  Aside from her feeling the blame for her ex-husband's alcoholism (the nerve of her not understanding him better!), the real passion and chemistry is with Stewart.  With that said though, it's a delightful movie, and the story behind its making and Katharine Hepburn's resurrection is a real testament to her intelligence.",

Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart â?? showing us how to fall in love on the big screen in pinball fashion. Hepburn stars as the wealthy socialite Tracy Lord who has divorced her familyâ??s favourite man for her, Grantâ??s Dexter Haven, is set to marry nouveau riche Mr Kittredge, but ends up flirting with Stewartâ??s reporter assigned to cover the wedding, and suddenly cannot find herself to decide which man is the one for her. This was Hepburnâ??s chance to shine and boy does this breakout role do just that, as well as define her as the epitome of a modern woman. Her characterâ??s power over her position was integral in giving her this image of a liberated woman with an unconventional lifestyle, something she maintained in real life by dating a married Spencer Tracy for 26 years, making her portrayal as Tracy Lord utterly believable. Having three men lust over her in The Philadelphia Story breaks all barriers faced by females, and exemplifies the importance of Hepburnâ??s persona in allowing her character to blossom into a vehicle for change. Lordâ??s constant wailing and exaggerated actions make her an instantly powerful character that thrives massively under the drooling of her male co-stars who it seems are entranced by Hepburnâ??s all-eyes-on-me performance. But no one can forget the men trying to win her affection as Stewartâ??s immature lusting over Hepburn produces that explosiveness of a short-term romance, whilst Grantâ??s calm and caring faÃ§ade emblazons him as the lover Hepburn desires, but cannot have. The Philadelphia Story is a comedy of remarriage due to the production code of the time, therefore Hepburnâ??s character had to divorce first, then be allowed to flirt, and then she can get back with her ex-husband without breaking any rules of adultery. This ingenious way of working around the censors of its time demonstrates why romantic tales of the past will always be better than those of today because the fact that it canâ??t just show what it wants, it has to work to find a way, develops the story in a unique way, and allows for plenty of candid moments. Hepburnâ??s drunken night with Stewart typifies why The Philadelphia Story remains a rare portrayal of affection. Along with It Happened One Night, this film proves that the simpler the romantic tale, the more believable the romance will be which in turn elevates our love for the characters and our connection to their vocation. The Philadelphia Story is so straightforward it is bland, but the manner in which Hepburn and her male co-stars joust for affection has seriously made The Philadelphia Story a rollercoaster of a love-square that never ceases in its pursuit of love.\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nKatharine Hepburnâ??s empowered nature allows her to stampede her way through men and love, as well as, along with her male co-stars Cary Grant and James Stewart, produce a romantic comedy in The Philadelphia Story that ranks as one of the best.\n \nâ??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??â??        9/10",

I love Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart, so a 40s comedy starring those two should be a big win for me.  Yet I was sadly disappointed.  One of the issues I had with the film was Katharine Hepburn.  While I certainly don't think she is a bad actress, I wasn't even slightly convinced that she felt genuine affection for any of the men in this film.  There was no chemistry at all in those relationships.  Therefore I wasn't interested in how she would decide because I didn't know if she even cared.  That doesn't matter in some films, but I feel like this was intended as an early example of a romantic comedy, so selling the romance is extremely essential to the story.\n\nBut even romantic relationships without chemistry can still interest me if there is a good story or a lot of laughs.  The real difficulty I had with this film was the fact that the dialogue was way too rapid-fire.  I struggled to follow half of what was said, and even rewound some scenes just to make sure I was able to understand what was going on.  Any humor that might have been included in the dialogue was lost on me because I didn't have time to react to it before 3 more lines had been delivered.  I'm all for quick-witted humor, but The Philadelphia Story takes that term way too literal.  There are a few sweet moments, and I might have chuckled once or twice, but this is a movie that fell drastically short of my expectations.  Perhaps if I were willing to watch it more times I would follow the story better and get the subtle nuances, but there weren't enough positives to make me want to give this movie another chance.",

The long scenes and simplicity of the sets make it easy to see that this is an adaptation of a stage play, but I think that format works well for this story.  The only problem (and only reason I didn't give the film a perfect rating) is that it caused the movie to drag on at a few points.  Regardless, the humor is great and Jimmy Stewart gives one of the greatest drunk scenes ever.  The chemistry between characters is fantastic as it revolves from love to hate and back again.  The script is very clever, neatly tying up all loose ends and remaining unpredictable from start to finish.

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\n\n\"I'm going crazy. I'm standing here solidly on my own two hands and I'm going crazy.\"\n\nEver since I got into classic cinema, there's always one particular film that's been calling my name for some time, and that's The Philadelphia Story, a romantic comedy directed by George Cukor and starring some of the finest classic Hollywood stars in the history of film, Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, and Jimmy Stewart. It's also regarded by many classic movie buffs as one of the greatest comedies ever made, with an 100% score on the Tomatometer and is ranked as the #51 movie of all-time according to the American Film Institute. With all this praise, you'd think that I would also really enjoy the film right? After my two-hour experience, I'm sorry to say that The Philadelphia Story was not worth its hype.\n\nMeet Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn), a spoiled rich woman who's about to be married to George Kittridge (John Howard). CK Dexter Haven (Cary Grant), the guy who was once married to Tracy and still sore over the breakup, calls upon Spy Magazine reporter Macaulay Conner (Jimmy Stewart) and photographer Elizabeth Imbrie (Ruth Hussey) to crash the wedding, which starts to backfire when both Dexter and Macaulay start to fall for Tracy's charms.\n\nWith all the acclaim the film has, you're probably wondering why I didn't care for the film too much? Well, for a 1940's comedy, it's quite dated. Most of the humor which is filled with witty remarks and punchlines that I should have really cracked up on just didn't fly, and I was mostly bored with the final result. I only laughed out loud at least twice in the movie, one being the opening scene where Cary Grant is kicked out of his own home (which I'm surprised got passed the Hay's Code as it features him knocking Katherine Hepburn to the floor, which was actually very hilarious) and the other time when I realized how overrated this film is. I knew the film was going to be annoying when I heard this so-called funny joke (\"If you're not Papa then that makes you...\"   \"Available.\").What also disappointed me was that the film wasn't really a comedy, it felt more like a romantic drama or something like that, and that's what makes the film so... boring. The situations the characters get into aren't really that memorable or entertaining and we're left with a very dull screenplay and a very boring movie. Even the film score by Franz Waxman, one of the best composers in that era, was not even remotely catchy in any way. I just don't get the acclaim of this film.\n\nIf there's one word I have to give on Cary Grant's performance, then bland would be that word. As much as I like Cary Grant, I didn't feel the connection here. You don't care for his character, you don't get a good reason why he still cares for the woman he's trying to wreck, and his chemistry with Hepburn is weak, which shocks me cause they did a fantastic job together in Bringing Up Baby, which had a much funnier script and more engaging humor than this had. Don't get me wrong, I think Cary Grant is a great actor, but I was not impressed with his role here.\n\nAs for Jimmy Stewart, who I rank in my Top 5 actors of all-time, considering the not-so memorable screenplay given, he actually does a good job in what he's given, especially his chemistry with Hepburn (which was decent compared to Grant's wooden performance), though there are some moments in the film where he kind of overdoes it, such as a scene where he wants to make out with Hepburn drunk (a scene that doesn't work due to the Hay's Code restrictions, I might add). Stewart won an Oscar for his performance, something that he believed that the Academy was making up for on account of him not winning the Oscar for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. I believe Stewart is correct on that statement; Mr. Smith was a very compelling role to handle, especially for an actor as young as Stewart was when he did the film. His performance here was definitely not Oscar-worthy. Henry Fonda should have won for The Grapes of Wrath instead.\n\nKatherine Hepburn meanwhile, is the most complicated actress to talk about, especially for The Philadelphia Story. Before the film's release, she was labeled \"box-office poison\" after the failure of Bringing Up Baby (which she was blamed for) and was kicked out of Hollywood, forced to do her acting on Broadway. After the success of the Broadway version of The Philadelphia Story, Hepburn thought it was a good idea to make into a movie, and with the film's success, Hepburn's career skyrocketed again, up to the point where the AFI regards her as the greatest actress of all-time. While I honestly did not care for the film, I give Hepburn credit for gaining a comeback with this film, and I was actually impressed with her performance. While the humor was dated and the situations were not that memorable, Hepburn still managed to grab my attention, despite the fact that she has poor chemistry with Cary Grant. I liked the fact that though her character's supposed to be spoiled, she doesn't go super obnoxious in the role, rather having a more independent nature in what her character is going through. I strongly believe that if anyone deserved to win an Oscar for a film that I would call rotten, Hepburn should have been the one to have won it, not Jimmy Stewart.\n\nI can see why the film was regarded as a classic back in 1940, but I could care less about The Philadelphia Story. Despite the good performances of both Katherine Hepburn and Jimmy Stewart, the humor doesn't hold up in today's standards, the so-called hilarious situations are not memorable, there's parts of the story that feel one-dimensional (such as Cary Grant's motivations), and Cary Grant gives one of the most dull, bland performances in a 1940's film that I've seen. When I watched It Happened One Night, I described it as \"the most overrated comedy that I've ever seen\". After watching The Philadelphia Story, I now believe that it's the most overrated comedy that I've ever seen. Funniest part is that the film's remake, a musicalized version called High Society, starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelley, and Frank Sinatra, even with the same situations and mostly the same dialogue, was a lot more memorable and a lot more fun, and one that I would call a real, essential classic. I did not get that when watching The Philadelphia Story.\n\n\"You're lit from within, Tracy. You've got fires banked down in you, hearth-fires and holocausts.\"",

Cary Grant gives a nice performance as Dexter, while the screenplay, written by Donald Ogden Stewart, won the film's second Oscar. It was later remade in 1956 with the musical High Society.

The Philadelphia Story is my least favourite of the three, because it's a fair bit less absurd and comedic (the other two are His Girl Friday and Bringing Up Baby). But that doesn't mean The Philadelphia Story isn't awesome in it's own right. In many ways it's not typical screwball comedy at all - sure it has it's fair share of farce, but this film is deeper, richer and more complex than most of its ilk. It's also a lot crueler and heartrending - mainly thanks to Katie H's incredible perf as Tracy Lord - not many characters in 2 hour films get given some complexity, and I can't think of another actress (then or now) that could've nailed the role of the wounded, yearning socialite so well. She's matched by Stewart here, playing a more cynical role than usual, and he delivers the funniest scene in the piece - his drunken bit opposite Cray Grant is beautifully, hilariously observed. Speaking of CG, HE'S different from usual too, less of the manic panic in his earlier roles, less of the narcoleptic urbanity of his later ones - here he underplays perfectly as one of the realest characters I've seen him observe, a person (like his ex-wife) burdened with past mistakes, grasping for the chance to maybe make up for some of them. Damn, that all sounds really heavy. This film IS a comedy - a fleet-footed, fast-moving, spolit-society-of-manners, stage-play-type comedy. It's just a very interesting comedy. And it's very, very yar.",

It's so unfortunate, that Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore (and I seriously doubt they could ever recapture this bygone cinematic magic) because they are just so wonderful. The talent was so different back then, there's just this aura of sophistication that sorely lacking with the crop of \"celebrities\" now-a-days, and the quality of the humor was so high-brow, relying more on lightning-quick, whimsical quips, perfectly timed banter and double entendre rather than on juvenile, sophomoric fart (or other bodily function) jokes.
