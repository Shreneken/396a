            "content": "You'll need subtitles just to catch all the fast talking, transatlantic, double talk. \n\nDirector Howard Hawks' romantic comedy His Girl Friday (1940) is very humorous, but also kind of too chaotic to even make sense. The entire movie is every character yelling over one another in hectic double talk sequences. Hawks' direction looks fine, but I found myself horribly lost in the pointless side stories and not really enjoying the stressful double talk and randomly serious drama that critiques unethical journalists that just lie for headlines. \n\nHis Girl Friday wants to be a smart satire, romantic comedy, screwball comedy, and earnest melodrama and so it only accomplishes all of these to a moderate extent. It's too cluttered. The simultaneous conversations seems like a neat gag, but when it's the only real joke, His Girl Friday failed to make me belly laugh until Billy Gilbert's Joe Pettibone character showed up. His Girl Friday felt longer than 92 minutes, honestly.\n\nIt's sort of funny as writers Charles Lederer and Ben Hecht's script is clever and full of wit. But the endless talking around matters is obnoxious and incredibly hard to follow. The charismatic performances bring all this stream of conscious dialogue to life. His Girl Friday is not very romantic as Cary Grant is practically the villain, manipulating his ex-wife into getting back together with him in a relationship and at work. I found Grant's character sexist and overbearing like his only redeeming quality is that he's Cary Grant. \n\nCary Grant is excellent as Walter Burns, but I don't like seeing Grant as a sexist newspaper editor. He's casually cruel and manipulative with his endless lies and deceptions. He is fun, but Grant is better as the nice everyman rather than a fast talking con man. Everyone talks quickly with Grant's same Transatlantic accent, so Grant doesn't even stand out vocally as much as normal.\n \nRosalind Russell is charming, but gullible herself as Hildy Johnson. I feel like she's introduced as a smart independent woman, but she gives up her family life and fiancee for a man that treats her terribly. If all she wanted was a career, that's fine, but Grant gives her no reason to fall in love as they're barely on screen together. Ralph Bellamy is fun as a completely gullible fool named Bruce Baldwin. He's almost too stupid to believe. Abner Biberman is fun as the con artist and thief Louie.\n\nJohn Qualen is touching as the wrongly convicted death row escapee Earl Williams. He's far too sincere for a comedy as these serious scenes drag the tone and pace down considerably. Helen Mack is shockingly moving as Mollie Malloy out of nowhere. She's the only person that cares about the man about to be wrongly sentenced to death. Billy Gilbert is hilarious as Joe Pettibone, who delivers the pardon of the criminal. His boisterous laugh and charming personality are very funny as the clueless fool. He elevates the film considerably.\n\nGene Havlick's editing could have cut this down into something slicker. It's fairly slowly paced for how much talking takes place and how short His Girl Friday is actually. Joseph Walker's shots are pretty flat as it looks like a play rather than a dynamic film. It's all wide shots with a few choice close-ups and medium shots to freshen things up. I thought the camera held too long in the same place to really hold my attention. \n\nComposers Sidney Cutner, Felix Mills, and Ben Oakland wrote a fairly forgettable score that's slightly lively, I suppose? Lodge Cunningham impressively mixes all the voices together so that you can clearly hear what each person is saying despite them talking over one another. Robert Kalloch gives Rosalind Russell a crazy patterned suit and Cary Grant a neat tailored suit. Everyone else has regular suits of the era.\n\nIn all, I am a bit disappointed by His Girl Friday. It is funny, but not nearly as hysterical as it should have been.",

I really don't think it would work even at 75% speed. It was a fun little story and Rosalind Russell's character really was something special for a movie made in 1940. I loved the gender politics in the film and the matter-of-fact dark comedy worked really well. That being said, the plot and characters and filmmaking really weren't anything to write home about but I did enjoy this movie.",

It seems that the filmmakers and actors sought to show off more than anything else in order to deliver speed rather than thoughtfulness. Grant's character is a charming scumbag and much of the film seems antiquated and aged rather than timeless. The screenplay weakens in the second half as it focuses on tying up the plot rather than offering the amusing quips in high volume earlier on. His Girl Friday is a decent time-killer, but not one that modern audiences are particularly missing out on.",

            "content": "Packed full of incredibly fast-paced dialogue, characters constantly speaking over one another, and an incredibly charming performance from Grant, His Girl Friday is probably one of the greatest romantic comedy classics that isn't really part of pop culture mainstream these days. There is always something happening, though Hawks dedicates a surprising amount of time towards darker moments that haven't seeped into the film's reputation - criticisms of the police and judicial systems, and particularly the press and yellow journalism (a woman literally attempts suicide due to the mischaracterizations of a group of backroom wordsmiths, and it stops the film dead with sobriety for a moment). The plot is convoluted, but that's part of the point - that Grant's Walter would go to such bizarre lengths to create the opportunity to preserve his relationship with Hildy (Russell), as faking phone calls gradually escalates to harboring a convicted killer. The fast-paced dialogue and consistent one-liners and brisk jokes often make this film seem like a slightly more fleshed out, romantic version of a Marx Brothers film, though championed by a magnetic performance from a single actor rather than a trio. Funny, short, and distinctive, His Girl Friday is still an absolute must see for both fans of classic film and those just looking for some entertainment value. (4/5)",
