    "summary": "After dedicated service in the Great War, a Jewish barber (Charles Chaplin) spends years in an army hospital recovering from his wounds, unaware of the simultaneous rise of fascist dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also Chaplin) and his anti-Semitic policies. When the barber, who bears a remarkable resemblance to Hynkel, returns to his quiet neighborhood, he is stunned by the brutal changes and recklessly joins a beautiful girl (Paulette Goddard) and her neighbors in rebelling.",

In it, Chaplin plays two roles, a Jewish barber and the incompetent fascist dictator Adenoid Hynkel, a parody of Adolf Hitler.  Considering it was released just after the start of WW2, it is a brave and powerful condemnation of fascism and the hatred that it can breed.  As with most slapstick, some of the humor misses the mark, but there are set pieces of inspired genius, among them Hynkel's dance routine with globe balloon.  The whole thing is topped off with a somber and impassioned speech from the barber, who has been mistaken as Hynkel, to an enthusiastic crowd about the evils that men do, capped off with \"in the name of democracy, let us all unite!!\"  Sadly, The Great Dictator is as relevant now as it was eighty years ago.",

            "content": "The Great Dictator is, largely, an absolutely stellar film, perfect in pretty much all ways except one.  That one problem is that the movie balances outright comedic sequences against dramatic moments that are almost harrowing, and honestly, the movie's shifting between these two tones is extremely jarring and uneven, and not quite in the Citizen Kane \"it was meant to be disorientating\" kind of way.  However, I don't hold this against the movie, as both of these elements work brilliantly on their own - the harrowing moments are genuinely impactful and gripping, like a PG-precursor to Schindler's List, while the Comedic segments are genuinely on par with Duck Soup (which I would still argue to be one of the funniest films of all time).  Charlie Chaplin's portrayal of both the downtrodden little man AND the monstrous and power-mad dictator is quite a sight to behold, and his Directing of the film is genuinely great as well.",

Charlie Chaplin acted, wrote, and directed the movie very well as he does with all of his productions, and while it was kind of slow and wasted time in a few parts, I'm glad that I chose to sit through it. Plus, who can't get enough of Charlie Chaplin's style of slapstick comedy??",

            "content": "Speaking of Chaplin, the most memorable is probably the bread dance in the Gold Rush. Always a funny face, a grin, a clown. But do you know that he was never just a clown, hidden behind his funny mask, is a great soul. \n\n  \n\nHollywood was at its high point in the 1930s and 1940s. Many classic Hollywood films were released during this time period. \"Gone with the Wind\" (1940), a roller-coaster love story set during the American Civil War; Waterloo Bridge (1940), about a beautiful love that shocked the entire world. However, it was he who tried his hardest at the time to create The Great Dictator. On the one hand, Chaplin maintains his poor little style as a Jew who has bad luck everywhere in this film. Although it stated that it would maintain the previous style, there was a qualitative change on both the inside and outside. \n\n  \n\nThe first distinction is that Chaplin's first sound film was The Great Dictator. Those who have seen Chaplin's films will be impressed by his lovable and hilarious silent films, which are always in poor condition. However, Chaplin speaks for the first time in this film. If you believe that his voice will match his previous acting abilities, deliberately make a very strange, exaggerated voice, you are mistaken. Although Chaplin is the same Chaplin in this film, exaggerated and funny, it's the same recipe, but the taste is completely different. Chaplin appears to be more normal here. On stage, he was the same clown, the same burlesque. But, unlike the previous vacuum-like feeling clown, this clown has blood and flesh, pain, and feelings. The poor creature who had been hiding behind a trembling body finally spoke for the first time in \"The Great Dictator.\" A staged or humorous plot, a tragic fate, or a tenacious life. Chaplin's Jewish ancestry is also worth mentioning. Hannah is the name of the film's heroine, but it is actually the name of Chaplin's mother. Hannah Chaplin, Chaplin's mother, was Jewish. However, until The Great Dictator, Chaplin never acknowledged his Jewish ancestry...  \n\nAs I previously stated, the filming and release of The Great Dictator were extremely delicate. The world of the 1930s and 1940s was in ruins. While the world was loudly celebrating the end of World War I, a man named Hitler was slowly making his way onto the stage of history. The world's situation is becoming increasingly tense, as everyone waits with bated breath for the aggressor's sword, to say nothing of him... Chaplin took the lead and created The Great Dictator. He portrays a devout Jew. Of course, we must mention his other series character, Singhal. If Charlie the Barber represents the normalization of Chaplin's drama, Singhal's character is closer to his former antics. But the wind here is funny, but always astringent enough to make you laugh out loud. Call him burlesque or artistic charm, but there is so much skill and sleight of hand here that you can't laugh. Because the hyperbole here is incredibly realistic. The lunatic, the representative of neuroticism, is fearfully fed by nearly half of the world. So, when the so-called \"upper human beings\" are absurdly leading the destruction of human nature, a clown spoke up in a corner of the world... \n\n  \n\nOf course, making the film was extremely difficult. Local Francophiles wrote him anonymous letters saying that if he continued to work on the film, they would not mind killing him. Even Roosevelt, the United States' president at the time, admitted that The Great Dictator was bad for America's foreign relations. When the film was finally released, some newspapers complained that it was too long and dealt with too serious a subject. The committee also claimed that the film was an attempt to enlist America in the anti-Hitler coalition.  \n\nOf course, if you believe there are no normal human beings in the world, then no. Halfway through the film, the United Kingdom declares war on Germany, and just when everyone believes they have won the battle, the Maginot Line is breached... The New York office immediately sent Chaplin a frantic telegram: \"Finish your film, everyone is waiting!\"",

            "content": "Dictator's are Never Great\n\n\tThe Great Dictator was the first sound film that the legendary Charlie Chaplin ever made. Charlie Chaplin does about everything in and for this movie from directing it, to producing, to writing and even starring as two roles. Two other main roles were performed by Paulette Goddard as Hannah, and Jack Oakie as Napaloni. There is so much about this film that impressed me. From Charlie Chaplin doing almost everything, to the depiction of what a dictator really is and how dictatorship never works out, and even the funny satirical scenes that make the movie bearing to watch. The fact that Chaplin was also able to portray a picture of this dictatorship and also make the movie a comedy is just outright legendary. I also love how he played both roles of a barber and a dictator. Two completely different aspects of the game and he killed both of them. He also does such a good job of making comedy scenes out of stressful moments. The scenes like the airplane when the pilot passes out and they flip upside down but Chaplin just continues to be himself and the funny guy he is. Obviously it's a 1940's film, but I felt like it was a perfect mix of a sound film and a silent film. There's some scenes that really emulate how good Charlie Chaplin is at capturing the moment without sound, and then with sound. The best part is the end of the movie when Chaplin delivers one of the greatest speeches of all time. The film was so funny up until this point and when he starts speaking everyone just knows to tune in. The production having Chaplin be dialed into the middle of the screen gazing deep into the eyes of the audience really captures the message he's trying to convey. It's undeniably one of the best endings to a film. His tone and deliberateness deliver a message to the people who aren't fond of the world at the moment, to the people that have some doubt in themselves or what the future looks like, and Chaplin tries to bring them back up. \n\n\t10/10. Like I said, I'm super impressed with Chaplin's ability to deliver such a well rounded film, and be a part of every single step.  His desire to deliver his message is also beautiful. He wants his audience to laugh a little, and then in the end understand the reason he decided to make the film.",

            "content": "The Great Dictator premiered in 1940 and was directed/produced by Charlie Chaplin; it starred Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Reginald Gardiner, and Jack Oakie. The film was based upon Chaplin's satirical portrayal of Adolf Hitler, as Chaplin wanted to bring to the attention of the world the disturbing issue of fascism that was taking over Europe under Hitler.  Chaplin plays both the characters of the dictator Hynkel as well as his counterpart the Jewish barber in the ghetto (both good and evil characters); ironically, this is Chaplin's first talking movie.  While Chaplin polks fun of Hitler with his exaggerated gestures, there are also various portrayals that are chilling, such as his voice on the loudspeaker in the ghetto, and when he is dancing with the globe imagining himself as leader of the entire world.  Chaplin's speech at the end of the film where he speaks directly to the camera, imploring people to stop the hate and be kind is trying to influence the audience that fascism must be stopped.  Chaplin took a big risk with this film given the ambivalence about the United States becoming involved in World War II at the time it was being filmed.  I highly recommend this movie; a clever film with an important message.",

            "content": "The Greatest Evil \nThis film was made in October of 1940, written and directed by Charlie Chaplen. It was Charlie's first and most successful comedic sound film made shortly after sound films were being made. The film was said to be historically significant and covered crucial topics of the time. The film was set during the Great War and was a play on Adolf Hitler and the time of Nazism. While these topics layed heavy this film was a comedic and dramatic way of portraying these times. After spending his time as a dictator he has a change of heart and urges those who hear him to fight for democracy and fight for their freedom no matter how hard. The notable final speech that was given at the end of the film where he asked for peace and compassion from those that were listening. He discusses how the world has become cynical and how we are one together with kindness and caring for one another and the world has room for everyone rather than making some feel that they are unable to provide. His speech was important to so many and those watching it made an impression on them. Like I have said, all of these films differ in many ways, but there are many ways that these films relate to one another in the way of having a strong impact on those who watched them. This film as well as Do The Right Thing, both discussed strong and important social injustices which most films are afraid to discuss and tread lightly on but these discuss to the full extent because they realize that these topics must be discussed, which is something that people are really attached to. We look at two sides of the story: the good and the evil, one who is a dictator and one who is a barber. The comedic punch is that later in the film the barber actually gets mistaken for the dictator. This was a historically important film and earned nearly 5 million dollars worldwide after its release. It was his first talking film which was a big deal in the world of silent films. It was also his most expensive film and I think worth the money for sure.",

            "content": "The Great Dictator is a 1940 satirical comedy/drama film directed, written, and starred by Charles Chaplin. The cast also included Paulette Goddard and Jack Oakie who were both well established in the film industry by this time. The plot of the movie is that a Jewish barber who had suffered severe memory loss and begins to experience the suffering of the Jewish people under this regime. This movie is a satire of Adolf Hitler and has a representation of his rule when we see his favorite opera being produced with the world globe spinning in the background as a balloon which then explodes in a great foreshadowing. Another major aspect was that I felt the dramatic camera angles and the slow panning made it feel like you were experiencing things as if they were just happening in a live broadcast. In a historical context, this film showed people how Chaplin thought of fascism and how it should be done away with contributing to the evilness of the world and holding on to hope that humankind was better than that. I would definitely recommend this movie to people, as it both is a historical work and one of the first movies with Charles actually speaking and is one of the few films that dared to cover such a sensitive topic in that time period. \nI felt this film was more relevant to a socio-cultural standpoint like Do the Right Thing due to how it showed the treatment of individuals within a race, social minority, and religious views being persecuted. The difference in how they handled those situations was completely opposed whereas Do the Right Thing did turn to violence and promoted action, while The Great Dictator pushed for peaceful solutions and forced out dictators/tyrants and other groups that would put people under the boot. The former used powerful scenes and controversial methods to highlight the discrepancies while the latter used comedy to show the ridiculousness of the actions taken and the motives behind them. In conclusion, I think this was Charles's best work in my honest opinion, most of his work being in silent films did not contain the impact this film did and because of the content, it just drove the point home far more effectively.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin the Workhorse\n\n\nThe Great Dictator was written, directed, and produced by Charlie Chaplin. The satire comedy about Hitler starred Charlie Chaplin and made 5 million at the box office. \nThe film begins with Charlie Chaplin as a soldier fighting in world war I. After he is sent to the hospital for twenty years, we learn about a dictator named Hynkel, a play on Hitler. Hynkel has taken over the country and led a force of discrimination against the Jewish people in order to wipe them out. There are various comedic points throughout the movie, like when Hynkel tries to play off his disdain for Jews in order to get a loan from a Jewish banker. This subtle comedy reveals how foolish Hitler's ideas were and pokes fun at him in various ways. Chaplin's take on Hitler is hilarious and allows this \"great dictator\" to be laughed at. Since the film was released in 1940, Hitler was still reigning supreme in Germany, so the historical meaning of this film was tremendous. For Chaplin to create a film like this was revolutionary and opened up the industry to all sorts of movies.\nThis film is an excellent example of why Chaplin was so well known and liked. He wasn't afraid to poke fun at one of the most dangerous men in the world at that time. He uses film to critique the world around him and wants to display his worldview to his audience. I think this movie can relate to Do the Right Thing by Spike Lee because of the discrimination that is played out in the film. The Jewish people were blatantly discriminated against during world war two, and when Spike lee was making his movie, there were plenty of issues of race between the black and white community. Riots started breaking out all over Los Angeles in response to the police brutality taking place at the time, which is still relevant to this day. The use of rhetoric in this film is what makes the movie so great because it comes from both sides of the table. The dictator and the Jewish barber, who look eerily the same, each make speeches that reflect their perspectives. I would recommend this film to all fans of Chaplin because it is one of his great works. I would also recommend it to anyone who is a fan of silent films.",

            "content": "Running towards freedom\u2014\u2014Appreciation of The Great Dictator\nThe Great Dictator is a film directed by Charlie Chaplin and starring Pauline Gaud, which premiered in 1940. This is Charlie Chaplin's first sound film. The film is about the First World War, when the dictator Singer (Charlie Chaplin) of the Kingdom of Thomania came to power. The conscripted Jewish barber Charlie (Charlie Chaplin) is doomed under the policy of hating Jews. When Charlie escaped from the border, the army stationed here mistook him for dictator Singer, and he took the opportunity to make a speech of \"fighting for freedom\".\nThe film was shot in 1940, when the Nazis swept across Europe. Chaplin openly bears great pressure on Hitler's ridicule and satire. Chaplin had the courage to attack the Nazis on behalf of righteous people all over the world. This film is not like the other two films, which can render the atmosphere or express beauty through color. In terms of sound, it is also Chaplin's first sound film, the use of sound effects is still in the trial stage. So most of the reasons why this movie is so outstanding is only Chaplin's superb acting skills. There are many classic scenes in the film, such as Chaplin dancing with the globe in the office with Hungarian Dance No. 5, but I think the most classic is his speech at the end of the film. This speech, praised as the boldest speech in political history, reflects Chaplin's great ambition. Whenever Chaplin is mentioned, his funny movie performances are always mentioned. But a little deeper understanding, we will find that comic is only a tiny aspect of Chaplin's life, more of which is his enthusiasm, his sincerity, and his justice. Although it does not use a lot of special effects and professional equipment as the current commercial films, its cry for justice in the background of the times made it famous in history.\nIn general, As one of the most successful comedy films in history, The Great Dictator not only showed us the witty acting skills of the comedian Chaplin, but also planted a seed of kindness and yearning for freedom in the hearts of each of our audience.",

Chaplin fought the chance of being socially prosecuted for such a film during a historic time, and nailed it. He was able to bring hope to the people that tyranny can be fought and defeated, while putting his comedic twist on it. Co-Star Paulette Goddard's (Hannah) was brilliant with her strong and brave character, helping viewers to feel empowered by her grit and courageous personality. Forming a relationship with the Jewish barber who had suffered a head injury in WW1 only to return to his hometown to see it had changed for the worse. Nominated for Best Supporting Actor Jack Oakie (Benzino Napaloni) brought double comedy relief teamed up with Chaplin, it was a hilarious back and forth between two dictators as they tried to one-up each other on the big screen. Using mid-shots, eye level angle, and low angle shots during the film was a Chaplin classic. Although Chaplin will always be know for his films during the silent era this was one of his best films because of his use of sync sound, it brought life and humor to his character that nobody had seen from him. I would compare the film to \"Do the right thing\" for it's bravery in going against the social change of it's time, and finding a voice and motivation for those to change that social injustice.",

Also noted actors in the film are Paulette Goddard that played Hannah and Jack Oakie that played Napoloni, The dictator of Bacteria. Charlie Chaplin's character in the film is a comedic rendition of Adolf Hitler. At the time Charlie was making a political statement without pointedly making it known that he disapproved as to what was happening between Jews and Germans. Charlie comedic stand against injustice can be seen reflected in the artistry of Spike Lee's 1980's Film entitled Do the Right Thing. Just as in the film with Charlie Chapin, Spike Lee highlights the maltreatment of those who are considered other and targeted due to their ethnic background. \nThe movie The Great Dictator is about a barber that was part of a war during his stent as a patriot he lost his memory and when retuning back to his home he faces an onslaught of derogatory comments and is harassed by militia men that are known as storm \ttroopers. These storm troopers continue to harass him and those who live in the \"Ghetto\" and the barber does not stand for it. In doing what he feels comes as second nature to him \"defending his community\" he meets a woman that further ignites the fire of justice within him. But all the while defending his community the barber runs into comedic situations that he narrowly escapes. While the subject matter is very hard pressing the comedic flair of it all such as the accidental bumps on the head the ingesting of items all offers a bit of tension release. \nWhile this would be considered an old time film due to it being taped in black and white I would still recommend it because this is one of the first sound picture done. The other films previous to this did have music and sound effects but this was the first true sound picture. The audience is finally able to hear the voice of a comedy legion and what is being said in this film is especially profound towards the end of the film. Charlie takes the time to speak directly for the need for unification instead of separation.",

            "content": "Adolf Hitler never had a chance against the mind of Charlie Chaplin!\n\nDirector Charlie Chaplin's satire The Great Dictator (1940) tears apart Nazi Germany's infamous fascist dictator and mass murderer Adolf Hitler. It's amazing that it was controversial for Chaplin to produce The Great Dictator lambasting Hitler right at the start of World War II. He was a truly brave director ahead of his time. The Great Dictator is his best made picture and ambitious far beyond what we've seen from the creator of The Tramp. \n\nChaplin's direction is lovely with J. Russell Spencer's elaborate art direction and Edward G. Boyle's pretty set decoration. I love that Chaplin kept his same goofy slapstick humor for the Jewish barber segments as The Tramp basically, while finding a zany Mel Brooks type vibe for his Adolf Hitler parody dictator Adenoid Hynkle. Chaplin finds these quirky gags to spoof the Nazis with an incredibly fast pace. Jack Cosgrove's visual effects are splendid with creative flair like the falling mortar round, exploding plane, or floating globe. His effects have the same pleasant absurdist humor as Chaplin. Editor Willard Nico cuts so quickly and sharply that The Great Dictator is 125 minutes that feels like 30 to me.\n\nCharlie Chaplin's writing is the most impressive aspect of The Great Dictator. He carefully critiques every aspect of German society and Hitler's cruel regime with inventive spoof after spoof that is simply hilarious. I was surprised by just how funny I found The Great Dictator. I appreciate the touching drama scenes that sympathize with the Jewish population forced into ghettos. The drama of seeing families in hiding, innocents bullied, jailed, and murdered is always difficult to watch, but I found The Great Dictator both entertaining and important. It's an incredible picture. Cinematographers Karl Struss and Roland Totheroh shot The Great Dictator with a fast moving camera with a far moving crane shot to glide along the ghetto to the absorbing close-up on Chaplin during his last speech. It's shockingly well shot and should have won Best Cinematography at The Oscars.\n\nOf course, I am most astonished by Charlie Chaplin's final speech, wherein Chaplin essentially speaks directly to all of us in a plea for basic human decency and kindness to prevail over cold machine efficiency, tiresome workloads, vicious armies, and anti-Semitic hate. You can feel and see how deeply moved Chaplin was as he desperately begs the world to change to be nicer and peaceful instead of hateful and violent. The Great Dictator contains the most powerfully moving speech I have ever heard in a film and to think it was released during Hitler's reign is poignant indeed. Chaplin was a genius comic, prolific director, funny actor, and poignant humanist writer. God bless Charlie Chaplin for this one.\n\nComposers Charlie Chaplin and Meredith Willson craft melodic bliss for The Great Dictator. Their sweeping score is captivating and really touching within the dramatic scenes and playful for all the comedy sequences. Sound designers Glenn Rominger alongside Percy Townsend make every slap, gunshot, and crowd cheer echo in your mind. Ted Tetrick's costumes are cute on Paulette Goddard and fiercely funny on the spoof of the German uniforms. Ed Voight's funny make-up looks so realistic and charming on everyone.\n\nCharlie Chaplin's acting is outstanding in his funniest role as he shaves and speechifies his way into memory as Adenoid Hynkle, Dictator of Tomania. I love his brutal and meek performance as the dictator, while also playing the frightening, but brave Jewish barber. Paulette Goddard is amazing as the funny, sweet, and moving Hannah, who represents the persecuted people escaping from Nazi Germany's terror in the ghettos. She's as funny and touching as Chaplin. I'm really surprised the entire ensemble is outstanding alongside Chaplin as they keep up his frantic comedic pace.\n\nJack Oakie is hilarious as the Italian stereotype of Mussolini with his Benzino Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria. Reginald Gardiner is funny and sympathetic as Commander Schultz, representing the dissenting German officials. Henry Daniell is absolute hilarious and fearsome as the Goebbels stand-in, Minister of the Interior Garbitsch with his terrifying all out support of fascism, hate, and genocide. Daniell is my favorite supporting actor here besides Goddard as he plays it straight, which is all the more horrifying to witness. Billy Gilbert is funny as the goofy general Field Marshal Herring as the Goering representation.\n\nIn the end, The Great Dictator demonstrates both Chaplin's sheer comedic genius as writer and director alongside his brilliant dramatic skill as an actor.",

Chaplin's expression through the film carries a strong entertaining, \"unoffensive message\" through history. Chaplin's display of Hitler in regards to a tramp plays on his anti-Semitic policies as dictator, it was an informative piece because at the time crisis was unknown to many. This movie broke barrier in the film industry it was a gateway for filmmaker to express political and social statements, it was easy for Chaplin to do this because he had the financial capabilities and his own studio even though there was must resistance Chaplin remained fearless. It shows that artistry and film and movies will never remain timeless. A great movie and groundbreaking film marking history and theatrics.",

            "content": "The first talkie of Charlie Chaplin came to the big screen as an immense success in 1940 as a satire of fascist regimes focusing on the Germany of Hitler. With this film, Chaplin managed to impact with his humor while he was reporting a situation in which many people were living at that time. \n\nThe movie's main characters are a Jewish barber from Tomania and the dictator Adenoid Hynkel, both interpreted by the director, writer, producer, and music composer Charles Chaplin. At the beginning of the film, the Jewish barber during the First World War saves the life of the official Schultz (Reginald Gardiner), but they suffer a plane accident, and the Jewish man starts to suffer amnesia in the hospital. After twenty years he escapes from the hospital, and he goes back to his ghetto without knowing that now a dictator that looks like him is ruling the country and they discriminate against Jewish and dark hair people. \n\nThis movie was filmed in 1939, the year in which Second World War started when Germans invaded Poland, and released one year after in 1940. The movie was banned in several countries because of the topics treated, for example in Germany and territories invaded by them, but in the U.S was well received. \n\nChaplin criticizes the abuse of power and the discrimination of other people; we can see that social issue in Napoleon Dynamite because \"superior\" students used to bully Napoleon because he was different from them. Also, both movies at the end transmit a feeling of hope, Napoleon by being recognized by their classmates when he dances, and with the last speech of Chaplin about equality, democracy, and freedom. \n\nChaplin was one of the first directors that hazarded to use comedy to make a social and political critic. He uses a lot of slapstick in his movies proving that humor is not only based on used jokes, but comedy can also be silent and visual. However, between all those comedic moments, he managed to surprise us with his encouraging speech and the amazing final shots of Hanna (Paulette Goddard). It was also characteristic of Chaplin his ability to stare at the camera and support his acting with the feelings transmitted through his gaze. \n\nIn conclusion, The Great Dictator is one of the best films by Charlie Chaplin, the message behind the whole movie, the hilarious humor, and the great characterization makes the movie worth it, I would recommend it without a doubt.",

            "content": "The Great Dictator is a film that was directed and written by Charlie Chaplin, who stars in the film as both Adenoid Hynkel and as a Jewish barber. The film also stars Paulette Goddard as Hannah and Jack Oakie as Napaloni and was produced by Charlie Chaplin and Carter DeHaven. The movie is a political satire that provides commentary about world affairs at the beginning of World War II. \nThe film was released in 1940 and follows the stories of Adenoid Hynkel, the dictator of Tomania who clearly represents Hitler, and a Jewish barber, both played by Chaplin. The film highlights Hynkel's absurdity and deep insecurities, while showing the terrifying scope of his public influence. The film concludes with a case of mistaken identity as the Barber and Hynkel are mistaken for one another, and the Barber delivers a controversial speech that remains chillingly relevant today. \nProduction highlights include Meredith Wilson's musical score and Chaplin's masterful acting as he jumps back and forth between the roles of Hynkel and the Barber. Chaplin collaborated immensely with Wilson to create a beautiful classical score where the music matches the on-screen movement perfectly, especially during scenes of silent physical comedy, and the film was nominated for the Best Original Score Academy Award in 1941. Chaplin is committed and convincing in each of his dual roles and the viewer is easily able to differentiate between the two characters, even when other characters in the story begin to mix them up. Chaplin's ability to jump back and forth between such two such opposite characters and inhabit both so completely is evidence of his artistic brilliance.   \nIt was risky for Chaplin to make The Great Dictator because of its divisive political content, but Chaplin did not shy away from the opportunity to use his platform to enact social change. When Chaplin began writing the script in 1938, he did not know if the US or Britain would even allow his movie to play in theaters due to the film industry's hesitation to get involved politically, but he persevered because he understood the potential impact of his message. In the final scene of the film, Chaplin seems to break character and gives a heartfelt call to action speech, directed not only at the fictional audience in front of him but at the viewer. In 1940, when the film was released, the United States had not yet become involved in World War II. Chaplin urges the US to abandon its isolationist stance in his concluding speech, calling for unity to create a free and democratic future. Chaplin's words were relevant in their original temporal context and remain so to this day. \nThe Great Dictator was Charlie Chaplin's first movie with sound and is different from a typical commercial movie because of its combination of the slapstick physical comedy of the silent film era with the realism found in films of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Much of the film's exaggerated physical comedy occurs in silence with nondiegetic classical music, such as a scene where Hynkel and Napaloni, the Bacterian dictator, compete to see who can elevate their barber stools the highest. Hyperbolic actions such as Hynkel climbing halfway up the curtains of his office remind the viewer of the movie's fictional nature and act as a buffer to the horrors of the fascist regime. \n\nI highly recommend The Great Dictator because of the way it reflects the historical climate of the time and for its uncanny ability to sense the future. The film foreshadows World War II without yet understanding the full scale of events to come and, although moderately uncomfortable to watch in hindsight, The Great Dictator is a must-see. Like the 2004 comedy Napoleon Dynamite, Chaplin uses comedy as a means of delivering serious social commentary, masterfully masking a serious political film beneath a comedic veil to examine the highly controversial political climate of the late 1930s and early 1940s. Chaplin implores audience members to follow his lead and take action, sending a timeless message of universal unity that, while it was too late to stop the horrors of World War II, may help us avoid similar global calamities in the future.",

            "content": "The Great Dictator Review\nThe film The Great Dictator, directed by and starring Charlie Chaplin tells the story of a Jewish Barber living under the role of a fascist dictator. The story is clearly meant to address what was happening in Nazi Germany as it was released in 1940. The film is a great example of how comedy can highlight social issues and address how terrible they are while also working to brighten a person's day. The film addresses the disgusting action of Hitter while expressing them in a palatable fashion. This film shows the power of comedy as it shared the atrocities of Nazi Germany in a way where people could watch and understand it. Often with a story as sad as what happened in Germany in the World War 2 it is hard for people to watch as it is so putting it in a satirical context allows for people to comprehend how terrible what was going on while still paying attention. Often, when faced with hard issues people are quick to avoid the subject by infusing these hard issues with comic relief just as Charlie Chaplin did. The fact that Chaplin played both the dictator as well as the Jewish man he is suppressing serves as a great cinematic device to show how the two men against each other are the same. It subtly expresses that although the dictator thinks he is above others just as Hitler did, he is not. The same concept is expressed in Do the Right Thing where the director Spike Lee where it is highlighted that people constantly think they are above others and where the uniqueness of everyone should be celebrated it instead divides the characters. These films show how comedy can be used to address pressing issues. The fact that this film was shot in 1940 and still expressed how terrible the Nazi's where helping inform people in the US what was going on in Europe. The film is an amazing example of how comedy can be used for more than just making a person laugh. The film The Great Dictator is an amazing film that touches on complex issues while still being easy to watch I would absolutely recommend watching it.",

Chaplin himself would later express a certain degree of remorse, admitting he never would've made the picture if he'd known just how far the Nazis had gone.\n\nIt's an important film, certainly an emphatically heartfelt one, and an astoundingly timely message, but it's also plagued with minor quibbles. A handful of conceptually proficient cornerstone scenes, genuine big-screen magic, are good enough to enhance the whole act. Chaplin's mesmerizing bubble dance with an inflatable globe, as a shining example. A cheeky shave-and-a-haircut routine, expertly timed to match the Brahms playing on a grainy box radio. His passionate, enduring speech at the film's climax, eyes locked upon the camera, which still rings, honest and true, in today's combative social climate.\n\nAt the best of times it's a brilliant example of all Chaplin could offer as an entertainer; a perfect mix of silent film pantomime, well-timed musical accompaniment and passionate, assertive rhetoric. At other points, he clearly struggles with the urge to do what he's always done. To cast aside modern soundtrack demands and merely focus on telling the story through sheer physical poetry. Apart from those few radiant examples, his instinct doesn't come as naturally as it once did. Not every scene works. The plot jerks along in stops and starts. As the film's running time grows cumbersome, we miss essential scraps of story, cutting straight to the finish before each piece is properly aligned. Though Chaplin's noble Jewish barber ultimately gets his moment in the sun, his alternate role as the scheming Hitler-lite despot is hardly served a well-deserved comeuppance.\n\nThe Great Dictator, essentially Chaplin's last bow as an international icon, gives us much to appreciate, and much to ponder, but a wobbly structure and off-kilter rhythm leaves a lot of its seething, righteous cinematic power unrealized.",

Commander Schultz was played by Reginald Gardner and Jack Oakie played the role of Benzini Napoloni. \n\n\tThe Great Dictator aims at Hitler, tyranny and Nazism throughout the entire film in a comical and compelling manner. The film begins in a state of war in 1918 where Tomainia is fighting for allied powers. The Jewish Barber saves the life of Commander Schultz whom at the time is in possession of highly important documents that could potentially allow Tomainia to win the war. After the Jewish Barber saves Commander Schultz's life, they attempt to escape by flying Commander Schultz's plane which ends up crashing. The Jewish Barber ends up suffering from memory loss and is taken to a hospital. Commander Schultz is informed that Tomainia lost. The movie fast forwards twenty years forward where the Jewish Barber returns back to his home referred to as the ghetto where he meets Hannah and falls in love with her. However, Tomainia is dictated by Adenoid Hynkel, who is ruthless and is all about anti-semitism is in control and building his military forces. The Jewish Barber is captured by the military and almost hung, however Commander Schultz, remembers and acknowledges him and demands his troops to release him. Schultz attempts to help the Jewish Barber regain his memory. While all of this is happening, Hynkel is denied a loan from a Jewish Banker, Hermann Epstein, resulting in Hynkel forcing an attack on the Jews. Schultz does not agree with the policies Hynkel is enforcing resulting in Schultz and the Jewish Barber planning an attack to assassinate the dictator. This all goes down hill when both of them are taken to concentration camps. Hynkel and Napoloni, the dictator of Bacertia are in disputes regarding whom should invade Osterlich. Hannah and her family end up fleeing to Osterlich only to be held up by soldiers. The movie then shows Schultz and the Jewish Barber escaping from the concentration camp by stealing uniforms from the soldiers. As they are escaping, there is a parade for the win of dictator Hynkel, however the Jewish Barber resembles a spitting image of Hynkel, resulting in the Jewish Barber being praised to be Hynkel. This is the only way out for them so they both go along with it resulting in the Jewish Barber having to give a speech. In his speech he addresses how he has had a change of mind and wants to end the dictatorship. While all of this is taking place, Hynkel is on a hunting trip and is mistaken for the Jewish Barber by troops. In his compassionate speech, he reaches out to Hannah who is listening to the speech and realizes that it is the Jewish Barber. The movie ends on a very joyful note where the country no longer run under tyranny, but instead democracy. \n\n\tThe making of this film sparked a lot of attention due to the fact that it was ridiculed at Hitler and Nazism. However, in the late 1930's there were not many movies out that exhibited such resemblance to Hitler and what was going on in Germany during that time. However, Chaplin did not hold back when it came to addressing the social injustice and the need for social change in his film. Even though Chaplin was nervous about how the audience would react to a comical film about a dictator, the movie did very well for itself and was considered one of the most popular movies of that year. This was Chaplin's first film with sound and he definitely used this to his advantage to portray, exemplify and mock Hitler and Nazism. I believe that the production highlights were positive at first, but after finding out the extent to what was occurring in Germany Chaplin said himself that he would not have released the film if he was aware. \n\n\tI definitely think that Chaplin did an amazing job in this film and I would certainly recommend it. The speech given at the end of the film by the Jewish Barber is definitely a cinematic device that makes Chaplin so authentic. The speech calls for democracy, peace and compassion and the way that the Barber looks directly into the camera and ensuring all the focus is on him truly allows the audience to fully comprehend the message of this film. However, what I think makes this movie so diverse from others is that he transitioned characters from the Barber to Chaplin, and took the political stance he believed in. I have never seen a movie before where the director is so devoted and orchestras a movie all around his political beliefs. I believe this was a great way for Chaplin to make a stance and address the social and political issues of during time. \n\n\tThis film definitely depicts the social change that was needing to occur in Germany during that time with Hitler as dictator. Even though Chaplin's film was unrealistic, it still depicts the social change that society wanted to see happen. Hitler did not care about others, he only cared about power. The inhumane policies and actions that were carried out under Hitler is cruel and devastating. The historic context that plays out in the film and happened in real life definitely allowed me to gain a new perspective on how society during the 1940's perceived what Hitler was doing. The concentration camps, hatred and discrimination towards Jews in the film definitely referred to an extent to what was occurring under Hitler. The Great Dictator emphasized social justice during the speech because he was fighting for society, how everyone should be treated equally and fight for a world consisting of peace. The social change needing to occur this film is very similar to Spike Lee's film, Do the Right Thing. Both films focus on discrimination and how we need to fight for equal rights to make society a better place. Both directors base their films on true stories which allows the audience to learn and gain a new perspective. However, I believe that Chaplin's movie ends on a rather unrealistic end, while Lee's film ends more realistic and hopeful.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator shows the reign of Dictator Adenoid Hynkel, played by Charlie Chaplin, and the struggle of a Jewish barber, also played by Charlie Chaplin, as he tries to live under Hynkel's rule. \n\nThe Great Dictator is an incredibly important part of both film and general American history. It is clear that Chaplin made this movie to mock Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Regime. Chaplin announced his plans to make this movie before America joined WWII. At this point in time, most countries were nervous to anger Germany, so were generally trying to avoid angering Nazi Germany. However, Chaplin was willing to act on his beliefs, despite many countries saying they were likely to ban such a movie. By the time Chaplin finished his movie, America joined the war and the movie was happily received as anti-Nazi propaganda. Chaplin's decision to start making this movie even when it was heavily controversial is what allowed it to be released at such a pertinent time during the war.\n\nThe addition of speech to The Great Dictator is another key aspect to it being as influential as it has been. Speech was also key to Hitler's propaganda. It allowed for Hitler's infectious energy to be transmitted across the world. To effectively mock him, it was necessary to be able to make fun of what was his key influential power. \n\nOne point I noted in The Great Dictator is it gives a positive ending to a dark story. The Jewish barber is able to share his opinion to the world, and it was able to take immediate effect. However, this is not a reality of a situation like this. This is done due to the necessity to end the movie. It reminds me of how the movie Napoleon Dynamite treats it ending. In Napoleon, a group of social outliers are shown as they live their life. But by the end, every character gets a happy ending. This need for a happy ending Is likely due to the films being comedies, and wanting to end on a high note. However, these movies both talk about serious social issues, and it's unrealistic to see these serious problems disappear at the end of both movies.\n\nThe Great Dictator is one of the most influential films ever made. While there are aspects of the film that are controversial, the overall message and effect are positive. I would recommend watching The Great Dictator if you are interested in early talking films, or WWII history in general.",

It also shows how he makes decisions on a whim with a group of people who have their own opinions but they're too afraid to speak up and go against this guy. One scene I found funny was when he pinned a metal on officer Herring but when Herring spoke in the eyes of Hynkel out of turn he humiliated him in front of all the other top officers by stripping him of all his metals, his buttons on his clothes and his dignity as a man. The turning point was when Schultz meets his old war buddy the Jewish barber who saved him, both find themselves on opposite sides of Hynkel's reign. Schultz makes the decision he must protect the guy that saved his life , not a Jew but a human being who is being persecuted solely for his race. This scene illustrates how if we have a personal relationship with someone, we can strip away the fear and stereotypes and look beyond the person's race. \nHistorically we can look at this film as an eye opener of how the persecution of the Jews was so wrong and how many people stood by and watched. The film was shot with some scenes where there was no talking but he used body language to illustrate emotion. The last scene in the movie and the speech that was delivered by Chaplin as Hynkel but really, he's is the barber was moving. He looked directly in the camera and chastised those who stood by and refused to speak their minds when they witnessed all this wrong doing going on and stated we all share this earth and love will always win because there are more who love than those who hate. Very powerful and could be used today. This scene reminds me of something similar that happened at the end of \"Do the right thing\" Chaplin is asking us all to do the right thing and not standby when people are doing the wrong thing.",

            "content": "The infamous speech is appealing because Chaplin is stating the obvious, something that no one did at that time, no one dared.\n\nThe Great Dictator\n\nChaplin is a bold filmmaker. But saying that, just that, would it be enough. I mean Seth Rogen and James Franco made and released a film that was accused of being an act of war. Maybe that was a bold move- MAYBE! This bravery is beyond limit, to a certain degree that it loses the wit and noble intentions and innocence and just hangs on the wall as a piece of art, alone, without any strings attached. And yet this cannot be considered or enjoyed or even understood instead of accounting the subtext that it actually reads on, no matter what the disclaimer might say at the beginning of the film.\n\nEverything, from writing to directing to acting, Charlie Chaplin is, instead of exerting, absorbing an enormous amount of energy for owning the rights of having an upper hand. And it works every time. Playing two characters, the hardworking empathetic barber with an incredibly moving from-penny-to-palace trajectory that emphasises to be of cinematic level. I am perpetually attracted towards his dictator figure that he so meticulously and passionately portrays. Not for what or who he represents, not the jokes, not the irony of it, but the enigma that Chaplin encodes that goes unnoticed.\n\nWhat he basically does and did at that time and day is, maybe deliberately or inadvertently, humanize the god-like-powerful persona. He has lavishly portrayed him, dipped and literally covered around gold, yet his dissatisfaction and inadequacies is what gives depth to this classic. Not the physical fumbles for the laugh but a sensible decision of his lifestyle that covers up his professional, personal, love and social life- the iconic scene of Chaplin playing with a globe, yes could be and should be considered as one of the best moments of cinematic history. The Great Dictator is great, simply great, and so is the crowd he wishes to nurture.",

During this time, the US had not intervened in Europe and there was a certain level of awareness about what Hitler was doing. However, this does not take away from the fact that even with what was known about the situation Chaplin took a huge risk when he produced this film. Regardless of some of the criticism and pushback he received he was determined to deliver his message. In filming this movie, I think he did a great job showing the audience both the life that a man like Hitler lived and the struggles and persecution that the Jewish community faced due to his horrific ruling. As a political satire, in this film Charlie plays the role of Hynkle Dictator of Tomainia. From the very beginning we can see that he is clearly portraying Adolf Hilter. Jack Oakie who plays the role of Napaloni, also does a fantastic job ridiculing the real-life Benito Mussolini. As his other character of the Jewish Barber, Chaplin once again does a great job using his comedy skills to demonstrate the harsh treatment from the Nazi soldiers and their living conditions. In the mist of all the chaos I think it was a great idea to see a romance evolve between the Jewish Barber and Hannah, played by Paulette Goddard. This added a good balance to the tone of the film.\n\nIt\u00e2(TM)s the message in the speech at the end of the movie where we find the social justice in this film, and a truly moving point for the audience. Having been the first movie Chaplin did with sounds, he could not have taken advantage of this in a better way. This was my favorite part of the movie and even after so many years his words stand true. His speech leaves us with the message that as humans we are not to live with hate towards one another but instead universal brotherhood and encouraging one another to live freely and happy. His message of democracy encourages viewers to fight for what is right and just and not to be overcome by evil.    \n\nIn addition to the speech, another production highlight is the great job Chaplin does playing two completely different characters and how they do, yet don\u00e2(TM)t relate to each other since one is Jewish and the other Nazi. For a film that was produced in the late 1930\u00e2(TM)s early 1940\u00e2(TM)s I thought that the sets for each scene were very well designed and realistic. For example, the side of the buildings in the Ghetto and the yard of the Jewish community. Another thing that stood out to me was the music used, I think it was well chosen and helped set the tone of the scene. The only negative I would say was the plane scene which obviously was very fake-looking. However, in their defense it was the 1930\u00e2(TM)s.  Some of the cinematic devices that stood to me was mainly the use of many closeups and once again the appropriateness of the music and sounds used made each scene powerful and engaging. How he closed one scene and moved to the next was very organic \u00e2\" for example when the Jewish community is gathered and the scene end and shifts to a day in the life of Hynkel . \n\nIn conclusion I highly recommend watching this film with an open mind. Although it may be a bit hard to watch or laugh at the comedy given the reality of the situation, it\u00e2(TM)s important to watch the entire film and understand Chaplin\u00e2(TM)s purpose in his production. This movie reminded me a lot about Do The Right Thing as they both portray the struggles and social injustice of two different communities during a different point in time.",

            "content": "Charles (Charlie) Chaplin wrote and produced the movie The Great Dictator in 1940.  If you have read up on this film, I\u00e2(TM)m sure you have read that it is a political satire where Chaplin pokes fun at Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime.  In this move, Chaplin\u00e2(TM)s first sound picture (talkie), he plays dual roles.  The role of Adenoid Hynkel, a dictator of Tomainia, and a Jewish Barber from the Ghetto, injured in the World War (Year 1918).\nRight from the start, the comedic side of Chaplin audiences have come to love and appreciate is evident.  While there is a disclaimer that there should be no comparison made between Hynkel and the Jewish Barber, aside from the wardrobe, there is no material change in the features to distinguish the two characters.  As such, Chaplin is able to brilliantly present, life in the shoes of the dictator of Tomainian, who lives in a lavish palace surrounded by men who wait on him hand and foot.  In addition, as well as of the Jewish barber, who fought in the war and now returns home to the Ghetto where orders of persecution have befallen on his town and people.  Oblivious to the oppression and maltreatment of Jews, the Jewish barber quickly comes up to speed through his neighbor, Hannah, (role played by Paulette Goddard) who holds her own by showing her comedic skills and bringing laughter to the screen in combination with Chaplin.  This is of particular importance considering the serious nature of the trials and tribulations Jewish people were encountering in Europe.  Bringing levity to the film at a time when there were rumblings of the beginnings of persecution by Hitler and German Storm Troopers was no easy fete.  As a matter of fact, it was of much contention as to whether the project should proceed. Given the main character\u00e2(TM)s strong resemblance to Adolf Hitler there was fear that the movie could create an uproar as a result of the political stance conveyed by the movie against anti-Semitism.  Yet, Chaplin defiantly forged ahead despite rumors of potential censorship and the rest is history.  \nAs an early aged movie, it was filmed in black and white.  The final production is in the cinematic technique \u00e2~mise en scene\u00e2(TM), framed as if in a picture, where everything the director wishes one to see is included in that particular frame.  As a result, the characters are seen walking off to the left and right disappearing from the picture and subsequently walking into others.  Other techniques used by Chaplin are long shorts, also known as \u00e2~establishing shots\u00e2(TM) to show a particular location or area, \u00e2~zoom\u00e2(TM) and \u00e2~pan\u00e2(TM) to get a good closeup of the character\u00e2(TM)s faces, as well as to follow them as they move from side to side.  However, you will note that when characters fall below or above the camera shot, their heads may not be visible.  One of the most success factors in The Great Dictator, in my opinion, is the non-diegetic sounds used to add to the audience\u00e2(TM)s entertainment.  For example, when the Jewish barber shaves a man, his actions follow the music.  In addition, when Hynkel dances with a giant inflatable ball, it is done so in an amusing way, again, to music.  Finally, other techniques to bring levity to the movie is Chaplin\u00e2(TM)s gibberish German speak as he makes fun of a pseudo-dictator the likes of Hitler with words like cheese and crackers and bananas amongst others ending with coughing fits \u00e2\" hilarious! \nThe very end of this movie is where everything comes together.  Again, if you read up on this movie, you probably also read about \u00e2the speech\u00e2?.  Yes, the speech which sums up the message Chaplin wishes to be clear and noteworthy to the audience.  It is the call to social justice in addition to social change required by all human kind for the benefit of the greater good.  In the speech lies the recipe to unite and achieve success as one and for one \u00e2\" democracy and opportunity for all regardless of our differences.  \nAs I think about the final scene, it reminds me of the final scene in Napoleon Dynamite where Pedro (Napoleon Dynamite\u00e2(TM)s friend running for President), has to also make a speech to win the hearts and minds of the student body.  Although these two movies were written and produced in different eras, 1940 vs. 2004, these movies are very similar in that they depict the challenges and infighting between popular majority/big guy vs. the minority population/little guy where the directors felt it important to capture the fear and intimidation in the faces of the main characters (i.e., Chaplin as the Jewish barber and Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite, an awkward high school young man).  Chaplin and Heder, in character, know that this is their chance and once in a lifetime opportunity to shine and face their opponents and adversities.  The reaction both receive from the people is eerily quiet at first but then evident how their final acts were received.  I won\u00e2(TM)t say any further as I don\u00e2(TM)t want to spoil the surprise.\nI will finish off by saying that this is a classic must see movie.  I really enjoyed seeing the movie and highly recommend taking the time to rent the movie.  It may have been Charlie Chaplin\u00e2(TM)s first talkie and his last box-office hit, but it is one which has and continue to withstand time.  My recommendation for this movie is 4.5 stars!",

This film, while still very comedic and satire, had an incredible message and empowering aspects that were very new when it first was released and still relevant to this day. Chaplin wrote, directed, and stared in this film, much like he did with his other films. However, this film was a turning point and very distinguishable from others at the time. At the time, the effects of the Holocaust were not well known and this brought it to light to others; through cinematic scenes, such as the one with the globe that gave imagery to what Hitler was planning on doing with the world and his power. This was also a turning point for Chaplin since was a breakthrough in the sense this was his first film where he would break his typical silence. This film showed much influence for social change that it should be a considered a staple for everyone to watch. This film was funny, but also conveyed a very important message to all about standing up for what is right and rejecting fascism and racism by showing the truth of how Jewish people were having their rights stripped away by a dictator. \nThis film\u00e2(TM)s message resonates from when it was made in 1940, throughout the years, and even through today. We see similar messages in films throughout the decades, such as Do the Right Thing in the 1980s and Blakkklansman from 2018. These other films that are from the recent decades have very similar issues and messages to The Great Dictator.  Do the Right Thing shows how minorities in a neighborhood still struggle with racism and other races feeling superior to them. This is exactly what happened in the Holocaust, but also what Chaplin so very well depicted in The Great Dictator. The historical context of the horrors of the Holocaust in a satire sense gave the film that much more power. It showed how this was an actual issue. People loved to see Chaplin movies because he was hilarious and entertaining. Chaplin took to wanting to initiate social change by embracing his greatest strength; getting across an imperative message through his satire films.\nOverall, The Great Dictator has shown that Chaplin really outdid himself for the time period and set a precedent for films that have similar messages. This film was comedic, but sparked deep thought about right and wrong and social change. Everyone should watch this film.",

This film was produced during a very sensitive time of world war and Chaplin had a message to deliver. Much like Spike Lee did with Do the Right thing in 1989. Both of these films were written, directed, and starred the same person so that they could ensure their message was delivered the way they intended it to be. The message in The Great Dictator and Do the Right thing was to fight oppression. Charles Chaplin took a very serious matter and some how managed to turn it into comedic gold. The Great Dictator follows Adenold Hynkel dictator of Tomania and Jewish barber who looks Identical to Hynkel. Both of these main characters are played by Charles Chaplin. Hynkel is attempting to take of the world and start his master race now that he has conquered Tomania. To do that, he must first conquer Osterlich, the country bordering Tomania. However, the army of Napaloni had already started their invasion of Osterlich before they are able to make their move. We then watch Hynkel scheme ways to befriend the dictator of Napaloni and fail hilariously at out smarting him. While this is going on with Hynkel, we witness the Jewish community and Jewish barber suffer through their oppression from the soldiers. Eventually through a series of events including a couple run ins with the Tomanian soldiers, the Jewish barber ends up in a concentration camp. While the Jewish Barber was in the concentration camp most of his Jewish community escaped to the currently unconquered country Osterlich to escape the war. The Jewish barber eventually escapes from the concentration camp to Osterlich just in time to save the country from being conquered. Hynkel gets what he deserves and ends up imprisoned. The Great Dictator really gave me some good laughs, and I found it pleasingly funny. The way Chaplin was able to make such comedic movie, yet sill deliver a strong message about a sensitive subject is impressive. This is a classic movie and I understand how it receives such praise from so many people. This is a movie I would recommend to people looking for a great classic comedy or even World War history buffs. I can see myself watching this movie again, and it was very surprising how good it was.",

Following the new fashion of sound films, which had already begun in 1927 (he considered that speaking would be the end of the character of the \"vagabond\" Charlot, which he was), Charles Chaplin took a step beyond his first audible steps in \"Modern Times\". In constant struggle to highlight the evils of his contemporary society, the director, as a strong supporter of democracy, decided to criticize an evil that was coming upon them. Asked later about it, he confided that he would have never had imagined how much fear and despair the character would bring to humanity. He went on to say that if I had known what would happen later, he would have never filmed it.\n\nHe takes advantage of his enormous resemblance to Hitler to create a burlesque parody of his person, in addition to combining it simultaneously with an entertaining drama of a German Jewish barber (Tomeio), who after coming out of deep amnesia, sees his country worse than even when he suffered the accident that caused him to lose his memory during the 1st World War. The conclusion is simply brilliant, unmatched by anyone. The final speech is not only cinema, but a message of freedom that he divulged with his cinema and his prestige (after this film he would be labeled as a Communist), with the hope that he would be immortalized forever, so that man will never forget that we are all the same.\n\nThe consequences were as adverse as could be imagined: Nazi Germany banned him for life (although it is rumored that Hitler requested more than once to be put in the film), communist Russia did not like too much due this burlesque tone of defending \"their\" ideals, and finally, in the United States, he again attracted the contempt of the most conservative factions of the population.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an immortal film whose transcendence leaves the screen to make the world aware and the audience thoughtful, and to show that cinema is not only entertainment, but also a vehicle of information and knowledge.",

Although it is funny throughout the entire film, the speech of unity and inclusion at the end makes this movie well Done.\n\nConclusion \n\nI would conclude that Charlie Chaplin wrote this film beautifully and the speech at the end should be watched many more times.  Up this point, I had not seen that speech.  It was truly moving. \n\nSocial Justice/Change Aspect \n\nThe social justice aspect of this film is how you should always do what is right.  Even if you are a solider, do not fight for injustice and slavery, but fight for liberty. \n\nComparison\n\n\nHistoric Context or Development Process\n\nThe historic significance behind this film were both of the world wars.  This film was released in 1940, a horrific time in the world\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2(TM)s history. \n\n Cinematic Device(s) Used\n\nEye level camera angles, log shots, close shots, black and white throughout the duration of the film, sound layovers (exaggerated), diegetic sound, dictator symbols (arm bands, way of speech to crowds, crowds clapping over nonsense speeches), wipe transitions",

            "content": "This final scene offers an extremely well written speech given by the Jewish barber, pretending to be Hynkler. The speech is extremely moving as it discusses a brighter future. A future without war between man, without hate, without national borders. This final monologue is truly amazing as it plays on the audiences emotions as well as desires for a world without the atrocities of war. The film ends with the character Hannah saying \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~did you hear that\u00ef\u00bf 1/2listen\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM); breaking the third wall and talking directly to the audience by saying don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t just hear what is being said here, listen and act on the words of this man\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s powerful speech.\n\nThe production of \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~The Great Dictator\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM) was well done considering that it was released in 1940. The film was done in black and white and with sound. At the time, this was still a very new technology. The footage of battles including the scenery as well as close ups during monologues were effectively used throughout the film. Charles Chaplin was also the producer of the film, which allowed for the final product to come out just as the writer of the script intended. This does not always occur due to creative differences between writers, directors, and producers.\n\nThe film \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~The Great Dictator\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM) holds similar motifs as \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~Do The Right Thing\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM). Both films raise the issue of taking violent action versus peaceful action to resolve a conflict. In \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~The Great Dictator\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM) there is a scheme that\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)s developed to attack the palace where Hynkler is living in, this scene comically approaches the issue by having a member of the group chosen at random to commit the act of violence. The character Hannah disrupts this by having everyone chosen instead of just one person. Ultimately, the Jewish barber is able to take peaceful action against the conflict at the end of the film by offering a powerful speech on humanity and peace to the world. Throughout the film \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~Do The Right Thing\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM), the character \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~Buggin Out\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM) attempts to start a peaceful boycott of a local Italian restaurant because they don\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM)t have African American leaders photos on the walls as well as Italian ones. This peaceful boycott does not take hold within the neighborhood, except for with one other person. A conflict arises at the end of the film in which the intended boycott turns into the murder of an African American by police, and a riot that burns down the Italian restaurant. These parallels between the two comedic films are clear since one films ends in violence as a call to action versus free speech as a peaceful response. Both films were very well written and produced. They each are able to discuss challenging elements in society while maintaining a comedic aspect.\n\nThe cinematic devices which are implemented into this film include the use of long shots as well as close ups to properly express the emotion of the story to the audience. The use of diegetic sounds during battles and conflicts throughout the film are effectively used to further the performance for the audience. Additionally, the use of non-diegetic sound through music is very well done; setting the mood accordingly to the scene. The technology of the 1940s limited the directors ability to employ more advanced cinematic devices, however for its time it was quite advanced.\n\nMy overall recommendation for this film is a must see. This firm is able to review the events leading up to World War II in Germany while maintaining a strong comedic presence. I personally have never seen a film that was funny as well as about a World War. The atrocities of the period of time make it challenging for any producer to create a film that makes people laugh while also noting important horrifying historical events. Charles Chaplin did a wonderful job writing, acting, directing and producing this film. As being of Jewish faith, I find this subject to be very painful and challenging due to the horrors of the Holocaust. However, Charles Chaplin was able to make me laugh throughout the film. This is truly a cinematic masterpiece not just within its time, but till today.\n\nIn conclusion, the film \u00ef\u00bf 1/2~The Great Dictator\u00ef\u00bf 1/2(TM) is a wonderful comedy about pre-World War II and the rise of the Nazi party. It accurately draws parallels to historical events while making good jokes on the people being depicted. This satire is truly a model for modern filmmakers attempting at achieving the same accomplishment as Charles Chaplin.",

            "content": "A stunning and rare example of true creative bravery, Chaplin\u00e2(TM)s 1940 film \u00e2The Great Dictator\u00e2? holds up as a surprisingly effective combination of slapstick parody and cutting edge social commentary. The film was created before the United States officially declared involvement in World War II, despite widespread reports of the Nazi\u00e2(TM)s extremely cruel treatment of the Jews. The film sees director and leader Charlie Chaplin in his first sound film using his newfound voice to criticize both Hitler and Mussolini while proclaiming the humanitarian values key to mankind\u00e2(TM)s continued existence. \u00e2The Great Dictator\u00e2? opens with a Jewish private fighting in the equivalent of World War 1 for the nation of Tomaina, a fictional depiction of Nazi Germany. The private, played by Chaplin, wakes up in a hospital nearly 20 years later having suffered amnesia from a plane crash. The man returns to his profession as a neighborhood barber in a Jewish ghetto, completely unaware of the escalated animosity towards the Jews as a result of the new dictator, Adenoid Hynkel, also played by Chaplin. Hynkel argues about the invasion of Osterlich with Benzino Napaloni, neighboring dictator of Bacteria, the film\u00e2(TM)s parody of Italy. The film\u00e2(TM)s climax comes when the Jewish private, having been mistaken with Hynkel, is asked to address Nazi Germany. In the subsequent sequence, Chaplin breaks the fourth wall and seems to speak directly to the audience, criticizing the barbaric ideals of the Nazi\u00e2(TM)s while urging the United States to fight back against dictatorship and totalitarianism. \n\tThe film differs greatly from the conventional depictions of Nazi Germany, which justifiably often communicate the brutality of the Holocaust in a dark and historically accurate manner. Chaplin\u00e2(TM)s parody of Nazi Germany is still quite bleak, but the director stresses the individuality of each Jewish character through his use of slapstick comedy, allowing the viewer to form legitimate emotional bonds with the story\u00e2(TM)s protagonists. Chaplin\u00e2(TM)s depiction of Nazi Germany uses comedy to illustrate the humanity of the Jews while parodying the absurd ideals and mob mentality of the Nazi\u00e2(TM)s. Unlike Spike Lees social commentary in \u00e2Do the Right Thing\u00e2?, Chaplin uses his comedy as a direct vehicle to delivery his social commentary. In \u00e2The Great Dictator\u00e2?, Chaplin\u00e2(TM)s denouncement of the Nazi\u00e2(TM)s is buried within the comedy itself. In \u00e2Do the Right Thing\u00e2?, Spike Lee uses his comedy as a way of disarming viewers, but the final climax and social critique have little if any comedic elements. In this way, we see two distinct film\u00e2(TM)s that both utilize comedy in drastically different ways to reinforce their overarching social commentaries. \n\tChaplin first conceived the idea of the film after watching the Nazi propaganda movie \u00e2Triumph of the Will\u00e2?, and was able to study Hitler\u00e2(TM)s mannerisms through repeated viewings. Chaplin became dead-set on depicting the oppression of the Jews and taking a firm political stance in \u00e2The Great Dictator\u00e2?. This was incredibly rare in Hollywood at the time, with many studios refusing to produce movies that included any mention of the approaching war. This was driven in part by Hollywood\u00e2(TM)s complicated financial relationship with the German film market. Despite this, Chaplin was able to self-finance \u00e2The Great Dictator\u00e2? and use his own studio. This afforded Chaplin with a degree of creative freedom that was unmatched at the time. As a result, \u00e2The Great Dictator\u00e2? stands out as a timeless classic, whose proclamation of humanitarian ideals still resonates during modern viewings. Where others shied away, Chaplin bravely rolled ahead. I highly recommend this movie, while cautioning those who may find the subject matter too dark for a comedy. In my opinion however, Chaplin\u00e2(TM)s comedy in this film elevates his social commentary by asserting the individuality of each Jewish character. The resulting film is a deeply intimate and personal, and perhaps the most significant example of creative bravery in all of film history.",

            "content": "I adored The Great Dictator. The film\u00e2(TM)s subject matter was gripping and fluid. The controversial presence of its subject matter is ever-present but not overbearing, due to the releases of tension through comic relief. I found the comical relief in this film to be employed with great intent. This relief is seen as purely circumstantial; it takes place separately from the storyline. Instances of comic relief I found to be cleverly employed in this way include the scenes when Hynkel is accidentally pushed down the stairs and when the Barber walking out onto a plank of wood while attempting to escape. Another tool I found to play well to this effect of comic relief is the use of supernatural forces. This tool can be seen when Hynkel climbing the curtain of his office, when the pocket watch being suspended, and when the microphones move on their own in reaction to Hynkel\u00e2(TM)s speech. I found the innocence of this tool\u00e2(TM)s use to be comforting; it made me feel as if the world\u00e2(TM)s inanimate objects were also reacting to and aiding in the event\u00e2(TM)s portrayal. \n\nThe film score of The Great Dictator is sparse and wonderful. In moments of tension, their national folk tunes were married with dischorant passages. Moments such as this one aided in providing a sense of instability. In another scene in which the members of the concentration camp are marching, there is a tune similar to that of the Sorcerer\u00e2(TM)s Apprentice by Dukas. Additionally, gestures in the film score were used as a means to guide us to better understand the inner lives of characters. In particular, I found that the complexity of soli violin passages did justice to Hannah\u00e2(TM)s character. These passages showcased the distinction between the way the world sees her, and how she feels. For instance, when Hannah is first seen in the film, she is introduced by her caretaker. He explains that she has lost her parents and has nowhere else to go. Following this, Hannah enters accompanied by a harmonic minor passage which is both reminiscent of Jewish music and evokes sadness. The music validates this idea that she is viewed as sad and helpless. Then Hannah walks down the street, consumed in thought, and her inner voice is heard in the hopeful melodies of an orchestra. I find that the film score employes these guiding gestures very well. \n\nMy favorite stylistic choice in the film was the well placed changes between the Barber and Hynkel. In one scene, Hynkel dances delicately as might be seen in a ballet, and in the next scene the Barber is introduced by the radio announcer playing Hungarian Rhapsody No. 5, which is a very stern and fast piece of music. I found moments such as this to distinguish characteristics between the two and clarify their mentalities at that moment in the film.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed viewing this film very much, and would recommend others to see it. I feel that this film handled the serious subject matter with great care, and should be commended for doing so.",

            "content": "\u00e2~The Great Dictator\u00e2(TM) was written, directed and produced by Charles Chaplin. It first aired in 1940. This film is a satire based on the Nazi regimes rise to power before WWII. The story unfolds with a German piolet named Shultz, played by Reginald Gardiner, at the end of World War I being saved by his comrade, a Jewish Barber played by Charles Chaplin. Charles Chaplin filled the role of two main characters in the film; a German Jewish barber who fights for his country during World War I, and Hitler; whom strangely looks similar. As the film progresses it tells a story of a German Jewish veteran of World War I waking up from a coma as a result of his bravery saving piolet Shultz. The barber disappears from the hospital he is being treated at and goes home to the ghetto, unknowing of the rise of antisemitism and the state of affairs in Germany. There are many comedic examples of this war veteran being confused and not understanding why he is being treated so poorly. As the barber arrives home and attempts at reintegrating into society, he meets a Jewish woman named Hannah, played by Paulette Goddard, whom he is romantically interested in. The film outlines the love they have for each other, although they are separated by the Nazi\u00e2(TM)s actions shortly after their relationship begins. As the conditions for Jews in Germany continue to deteriorate in the film, there is a conflict in which Nazi officers are threatening the Jewish Barber. Coincidentally, the piolet whom he saved years before recognizes him and orders the soldiers to leave him alone, as well as his friends. This is a good example of social justice. However, for his actions, Shultz is stripped of his military status, and sent to prison for being a traitor and Jewish sympathizer. Throughout \u00e2~The Great Dictator\u00e2(TM) several jokes on the chain of command and following ones leaders blindly are made, as Nazi officers continue to do foolish acts even against themselves.\n\n\tIn the film, the names of the countries and individuals being depicted are changed for dramatic effect. Adolf Hitler, was renamed to Hynkler as the dictator of Tomainia. Additional members of the Natzi party that are portrayed in the film have different names as well. For example, one of Hynklers close advisors, the chief of propaganda, is named \u00e2~Garbitsch\u00e2(TM) played by Henry Daniell. This character plays a role resembling that of Joseph Goebbels, one of Hitlers top advisors and chief of propaganda. Throughout the film, there are historical references to different aspects of Goebbels actions; such as a strong stance promoting antisemitism and violence against the Jews of Europe. There are additional comedic notes attributed to his name sounding like the word \u00e2~garbage\u00e2(TM). Another parallel drawn to historical references is Hynklers\u00e2(TM) minister of war. The character was named \u00e2~Herring\u00e2(TM), played by Billy Gilbert; throughout the film Hynkler blames and yells at \u00e2~Herring\u00e2(TM) for military and invention failures. This draws from the historical aspect of Hitler in which he would argue, disagree, and often blame his generals for his failures.\n\n\n\tAs the film develops, Hynkler attempts at creating an alliance with the \u00e2~dictator of bacteria\u00e2(TM) named Napaloni, played by Jack Oakie. Napaloni and Hynklers meeting depict the interactions and disputes between Adolf Hitlers and Benito Mussolini, the dictator of Italy and ally to the Nazi party during WWII. These disputes in the film are exemplified by a scene in which Hynkler wants to invade Russia, but is unable to until Napaloni removes his troops from the border. This meeting which goes poorly in the film outlines the historical fact that the whole world was attempting to spy on and uncover Hitlers plans, this is portrayed during a scene in which an \u00e2~American journalist\u00e2(TM) sneaks into the building to find out more about the meeting behind closed doors. The film offers the audience comedic relief by depicting the dictators of Germany and Italy during the pre-WWII period having a food fight; as well as \u00e2~English mustard\u00e2(TM) burning both of their mouths. This metaphor of \u00e2~English mustard\u00e2(TM) harming Hynkler and Napaloni represents the retaliation that occurs later in the war by the allied powers against Germany and Italy. Furth more, Hynkler is playing with an inflatable globe before he accidentally pops it. This metaphor expresses the childlike approach Hitler had to world affairs, he was willing to destroy the whole world as he played leader.\n\n\tLater in the film, the Jewish barber is sent to a concentration camp and his love interest Hannah leaves Germany with her family seeking refuge in the neighboring country. In the concentration camp the barber finds comrade Shultz and they execute an escape plan in which they are dressed up as high ranking Nazi officers. At the same time, Hynkler is duck hunting in a nearby river, as advised by \u00e2~Garbitsch\u00e2(TM), in order to dismiss suspicion of a pending invasion of Osterlich; depicting the invasion of Austria. \nCont...",

            "content": "The Great Dictator is a movie drama produced, written and directed in 1940 by a comedian named Charlie Chaplin. In the film, a man named Adenoid Hynkel becomes dictator of Tomania with plans to take over the world at the expense of the Jews. A Jewish barber who had been hospitalized for several years returns home to Tomania only to realize the country has completely changed. It is being run by troopers under a new leader. This is a ginormous social change for him to just walk into this surprising new environment. There is nothing like a warm welcome home! He also experiences social change when some troopers mistake the barber for Hynkel, their leader. He is finally able to have his voice heard by the public and takes the opportunity to spread a message of peace all across the land. This case of mistaken identity had probably saved his life and everyone else\u00e2(TM)s. Ultimately throughout the film, the barber does anything to stay safe, as these times, laws and racist tactics are changing rapidly. The Great Dictator has some amazing production highlights that are in both the big and small moments of the film. I believe that Chaplin hit the mark in creating the fantasy world of Tomania and not having the film set in an actual place. This cinematic device, accompanied by the film\u00e2(TM)s political satire, is strategic and makes the film different from a lot of other films in its era. These could be some of the reasons that there was a lot of attention being paid to it.\n\n \tAlthough this was very original, Chaplin had his dictator posing in a very familiar way. He was doing the famous Hitler salute and had the same facial hair and demeanor as him as well. Throughout the film, the audience will see the historical context of The Holocaust is present in this film in many ways. It also focuses on what it means to be in a dictator\u00e2(TM)s role. In a specific scene, it outlines Hynkel\u00e2(TM)s typical day. Spending time with women, going to meetings, posing for paintings to be made of him, plotting his next move etc. the film shows that Hynkel was always so busy. In comparison to the movie Napoleon Dynamite, this movie is much different but it also shows how each character is specific to their role with outlined duties and responsibilities. As previously assumed by society, a dictator is busy with a scheduled day, just as a social outcast is awkward and has an odd at-home-life. This rings true for both characters in these movies and both directors succeed in bringing this out in the best way possible. In conclusion, I would highly recommend one go watch The Great Dictator because it was said to come out before people were aware of what death camps or murder of Jewish people in the holocaust looked/felt like. It offers insight and perspective that was not morphed by society and gives the audience a raw impression of these times.",

            "content": "I love how Chaplin brings his pantomime slapstick into The Great Dictator. It plays as well as it did in the silent films, and makes me laugh as much as any of the lines spoken in this movie. There are a couple of set pieces where he goes into his routine (the barbershop and the globe dance) that are among the most memorable and enjoyable moments in the whole film. Chaplin knows how to insert a small physical gag into other scenes as well that elevate them beyond the humor written in the dialogue. I was laughing consistently through almost this entire movie because there was always something to surprise and amuse me. It has everything that I liked about the great silent films Chaplin made, and something more. The Great Dictator seems like it is the kind of movie that could ruffle some feathers, because people don\u2019t typically like when you take something so serious and treat it with levity. It might help a little that this is all centered on a fictional nation, but the similarity to Nazi Germany is too obvious to let that soften the blow. For me it is a delightful thing that allows me to laugh at the juxtaposition of silly things coming from Hitler (oops, I mean Hynkel.) We get to see the stupidity of evil men and laugh at their expense, and at the same time we get to see the delightful alternative from the good people who know the right thing to do. This whole parody scenario of WWII was part of what made the movie transcend a typical comedy for me. I was also delighted by the writing of The Great Dictator. It seems juvenile, but even the silly names of the characters were enough to get me chuckling. When he starts ordering around Garbitsch and Herring, I could not stop laughing. Each conversation I was ready for the next witty one-liner, and this movie delivered on them again and again. Then there was the serious stuff, because Chaplin wisely used The Great Dictator for more than just poking fun at the evil he saw in the world at that time, he also makes a statement about what we should be doing to improve the world. It\u2019s kind of amazing how this movie still has relevance to current events 78 years after it was made. I think that\u2019s what makes The Great Dictator such a milestone, because it\u2019s more than a series of jokes (even though the jokes are great,) it\u2019s also a movie that sends a powerful message.",

It's attempts to balance the Director's trademark slapstick humour with serious satire often feel unpalatable, and the overdone silliness can be grating at times, as is the length at which some scenes run for, particularly when there is no music playing, giving them a hollow, awkward feel. Chaplin is completely in his element here, essentially playing The Tramp as 2 individuals, one a mad, posturing tyrant, the other man so closely modelled on The Tramp he may as well be called that. It's competent in most departments but is a disaster when it comes to basic editing. I don't know if it's the transition from silent film to sound, but some of the scenes just stop when they look like they still have time to go, cutting off in the middle of conversations, and some of them last less than a minute. It's jarring to say the least and completely interrupts the flow the scenes usually have. I wanted to enjoy it more than I did, and I appreciate the bravery of going after essentially the most dangerous man at the time, but time hasn't been kind to it, and the uneven tone makes it hard to like both the comedy and the pathos.",

            "content": "Few students of cinema dispute to statement that Charles Chaplin is one of the greatest pioneers of both the art form and the industry. His career as a writer, director, producer and composer as well as the star of most of his features spanned over half a century which coincided at the time period that encompassed motion picture going from me a novelty to the most popular form of entertainment. This film spanned the period of time silent movies shown with a hand cranked projector not only into the age of the talkies also the advent movies and color. Like many great innovators Mr. Chaplin exploring ideas different than those in the majority to just is professional interest. He was deeply committed to social issues of the time and stalwart defender of the common man. Undoubtedly this was greatly influenced by the point in history in which he began his career. Starting during World War I he witnessed a relatively minor events can escalate into a global conflict. One of the greatest influences of a large part of his body of work was the Great Depression. After the collapse of the stock market in 1929 entire world was plunged into economic ruin. Here in United States this is exacerbated by a major drought in the Midwest which had been aptly named the breadbasket of the world. Fertile land turned to dust only to blow away in massive storms. Mr. Chaplin greatly identified the disenfranchised people left hungry and homeless in the street which gave rise to his most iconic character, the Little Tramp. Little square mustache, bowler had been cane is funny walk and mastery of facial expressions combined with his uncanny ability for slapstick comedy made him one of the most beloved and highest-paid actors were 1940 Mr. Chaplin, as the rest of the world, watch this once again the entire globe was caught up in early armed conflict, World War II. People had noticed that his mustache on uncanny resemblance to one of the most despised men in history, Adolf Hitler. Prompted by his own socio political philosophy he undertook one of the greatest political satires ever made even though he was strongly advised it was far too controversial to release. The result is the film on the consideration here 'The Great Dictator' released in 1940 now available for the highly respected Criterion Collection. This was long deserved since this was one of Chaplin's most commercially successful movies and praised by cinematic historians as being his most culturally significant and historically important films.\n\nThe family set in 1918 with the fictional nation of Tomainia, obviously a stand-in for Germany, during a major conflict. Two soldiers have a chance meeting between a Jewish barber (Charles Chaplin) and pilot named Schultz (Reginald Gardiner). The ball bounces to save the life of the pilot but the incident left the aviator with a concussion and a case of amnesia. 20 years later Schultz has been promoted while serving under the regime of ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also played by Charles Chaplin). The dictator orders a purge of all the Jews in the country an action found unconscionable by Schultz. He objects to the policy refusing to follow the orders is immediately incarcerated. Managed to escape and has to the ghetto he is taken in by the barber. His girlfriend, Hannah (Paulette Goddard) and her family are able to get out of the country for these of the relative safety of Osterlich (Austria). Just as they had managed to escape both the Bob and Schultz were arrested by storm troopers. After a failed attempt an alliance with another dictator, Napaloni ( Jack Oakie), the tyrant of the country Bacteria, Hynkel invades Osterlich trapping had her and her family in the now occupied country. Shelton the ball managed to escape again wearing stolen uniforms. As it so happens there is a huge parade to be a dictator just of the barber, now in his uniform, arrives. He is instantly mistaken for the real dictator. Meanwhile the real Hynkel is duck hunting in civilian clothes mistaken for the escaped barber and imprisoned. Schultz tells the barber that the only way to get out of this alive is for him to impersonate Hynkel and give the expected speech. As he takes the steps of the platform it occurs to him that he might as well try to make the best of the situation. Content of his speech surprises everyone in attendance as the barber, disguised as the dictator, tells the crowd that he has had a change of heart and he makes a for peace, goodwill and tolerance. Before closing the speech he has a little message directed to Hannah. Heather hears his voice over the radio and realizes who he is. She has left Osterlich and is working as a laborer on a farm out in the countryside.\n\nAs the various associations using this allegoric story are barely vailed with each character obviously tied to the real-life counterpart. Mr. Chaplin was exceptionally well read and although was famous for slapstick comedy he was exceptionally intelligent as demonstrated in this film fully capable of set innuendo in his approach to satire. His personal feeling those oppressive regimes and their dictators off little more than a disease upon mankind is obvious. The first name of the Tomainia leader in obvious standard for Hitler is Adenoid, a frequently infected and large mass of emphatic tissue in the back of the throat. Not-so-subtle placed nuance that what issues for from this man's mouth is infected the disease. This motif is even less subtly used in naming the allied country, Bacteria. There dictator, Benzino Napaloni, an obvious stand-in for Benito Mussolini. Although high-ranking officers advising Hynkel represent such heinous Nazis as Joseph Goebbels, and the personage of Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) as Henkel's Secretary of the Interior and Minister of Propaganda. Another loyal high-ranking official, Herring (Billy Gilbert), is a caricature of Hermann G\u00f6ring. Herrings functions as Henkel's Minister of War. His trust and failure at demonstrating new weapons that your source of annoyance of the dictator.\n\nOne aspect of this movie remains closely cinematic and world history is how Chaplin was influenced by the Nazis premiere propaganda filmmaker, Leni Riefenstahl. She remains a controversial figure to this very day despite the fact that she was pivotal to the persecution of the Jews through her propaganda many of her films utilized major advances in the field of cinematography and editing. Chaplin was greatly influenced by wonderful films that depicted Adolf Hitler giving an impassioned albeit hateful speech captured by Riefenstahl. Chaplin made good advantage of this being a talkie by mimicking that speech in German sounding gibberish or perfectly emulating the nuances of Hitler's body language and facial expressions. Chaplin spent many hours studying as film for the newsreels. This movie made some in the translation over the decades and would be best appreciated by those who are suitably knowledgeable about world history and some of the more innovative aspects of filmmaking. In any case remains one of the few examples of dark humor in Mr. Chaplin's oeuvre. Considering this is part of the Right Here in Collection every effort was made to ensure that the presentation is as close as possible to the original theatrical run. The high-definition video presented on the Blu-ray version of the film is the result of a painstaking full restoration of the movie.",

While playing his run-of-the-mill tramp character with his usual flourish, Chaplin delivered a masterstroke as Hynkel - a mockery of Hitler by generating laughs from the eccentricity and egotistic nature of the character. By making a comedy out of the highly precarious situation of the Jews exactly during the full blown Holocaust might have garnered a reputation for bad taste, but enough care was taken not to hurt feelings and all the angst is directed towards the fascists. \n\nA Jewish Barber (Charles Chaplin) suffers amnesia after getting injured in the war saving a General. The barber remains contained in a hospital staying ignorant to the ascent of a tyrant Hynkel - the eccentric dictator of Tomania (Charles Chaplin again) and the condition of his kind. When he stands up to the harassing fascist soldiers after walking into the turbulent world he earns love of Hannah (Paulette Goddard) but wrath from the fascists saved timely by the General. Meanwhile Hynkel is plotting to invade Osterlich by tricking Napolini, the dictator of Bacteria into pulling back their army. \n\nCharles Chaplin is already a legend in playing the tramp character, but Hynkel was a different ballgame for him. It is a character of aggression, superiority and eccentricity but still clumsy as the tramp. The war sequences, rich palace settings elevates the scale of the movie compared to his previous outing, an equally magnificent 'Modern Times'. Chaplin is a gifted all rounder with a profound writing talent that always portrays the triumph of looking at life in positive outset and a sense of humor. The background score is melodious and rich according the situations. Paulette Goddard looks aged and heavy compared to 'Modern Times' but retains the charm and infective energy she possessed there. The remaining actors and the technical departments do an apt job in putting together this masterpiece. \n\nAudacious, extravagant, contemporary and darkly hilarious",

In a silent era rife with brilliant comics, he stood head and shoulders above the rest. His physical abilities were peerless, even balletic. He was the hugest comedy box office draw in any country his movies were shown. His innovations defined the Art of Film Comedy and moviemaking generally. He was the unquestioned master of his genre; as Tom Stoppard said about Shakespeare, Chaplin was \"out in front by a mile, everybody else trying to close the gap.\"\n\nSo why doesn't he make me laugh?\n\nIt's not that I'm too jaded for slapstick. I still laugh uproariously at Laurel and Hardy and Buster Keaton. Chaplin has just never made me laugh that hard. Perhaps he was too copied over the decades. I was familiar with his shtick before I ever saw his actual movies.\n\nThat's all forgiven for a movie like The Great Dictator though, because while all the Chaplinesque comedy is there, that's not the point of this movie. In 1940, when there was still enormous resistance to American intervention into the burgeoning war in Europe, when beloved icons like Charles Lindbergh were touting support for how that plucky little guy in Germany was picking that tattered country up by its bootstraps, when there was enough anti-Semitism in America to turn a blind eye to the often disbelieved reports coming out of the Jewish ghettos, Chaplin took a stand in his art when few others in America were. It's hard to believe nowadays that taking a stand against Hitler was once controversial. But it was, and Chaplin did, in no uncertain terms, devoting the full weight of his reputation and genius.\n\nAbout halfway through this movie, I was no longer concerned that Chaplin wasn't making me laugh. The pressure of laughing at his comedy faded and the scope and artistry of his vision emerged. I wasn't just paying respect to a respected icon. I was in awe of a satiric masterpiece. And by the time Jack Oakie showed up in his faux-Mussolini character, I was genuinely laughing.",

In the mean time, he gives an equally fresh look on acting as the Tramp, this time with some dialogues. Paulette Goddard is also excellent in her role. Another thing that make the Great Dictator different from Chaplin's other films is the fact that he is backed up by a lot of superb supporting actors, a feat that's only seen before in The Kid(1921).

The Tramp's first full-on talkie has him as a poor Jewish barber struggling for survival while Germany is under power by Adolph Hitler. Sorry, I meant \"while Tomania is under power by Adenoid Hynkel.\" Poking fun at the most heinous military of the modern era was always going to stir controversy, and as Chaplin himself became more aware of the Nazi's atrocities, he shifted the tone of the film to a more somber one. And the result is an astounding film with all of Charlie Chaplin's goof-ball slapstick that matures before your very eyes. By the third act, it attacks the twisted ideals of the Third Reich, and ends with Chaplin laying bare the sentiment of humanity in an epic 5 minute monologue.",

The Great Dictator benefits from its interesting political premise that delivers strongly during its final minutes, but it sadly fails to engage me through its characters. In this film, we see Chaplin take on the role of two different individuals, and both are equally given screen time. It is because of this attempt of balance that characters are not as fleshed out as I wanted them to be; I found the dictator to be a dull character to watch, despite its satire on the German leader. The barber was a little better because his story was more inspiring and heartfelt. I also felt the film suffered from comedic dryness, with the tone of the film seemingly more serious and dire as I hoped from a satire; it shows Chaplin in a different light as a director and actor but unfortunately it does not pay off. The Great Dictator is also the start of Chaplin's use of audible dialogue and it is obvious that he is still getting the hang of it, as many of the scenes throughout lack the impact that he intended for them to create. Despite all of these complaints, there are still some moments in the film that ultimately worked, I liked the relationship between the barber and his neighbour Hannah, and some of the scenes in the film did gain a laugh from me. I just simply wished it would be much more, reaching the heights that The Kid and The Gold Rush was able to deliver.",

When I look at comedy's today I see good work and overall a good comedy. But it will never be like Charles Chaplin the great dictator. This movie mixers comedy and drama together so perfectly nothing can top it. The globe scene, the train scene and the speech at the end which made me cry because how true it is and how much we need it to make the world a better place. Overall the great dictator is outstanding movie with a great story and a brilliant speech. \n\nQuote from Dictator of Tomania: \"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you; who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate; the unloved and the unnatural. Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of St. Luke, it is written that the kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power. Let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people. Now let us fight to fulfill that promise. Let us fight to free the world! To do away with national barriers! To do away with greed, with hate and intolerance! Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!",

Chaplin's slapstick humor, combined with his small frame, really provide a good laugh for me. If there might have been a complaint anyone has had with him, it might be the lack of sound within a good bit of his films. Nonetheless, they were still excellent. So, here we are with Chaplin's first ever all-dialogue film: The Great Dictator. When I had first watched this film a few years back, I found it to be among Chaplin's weaker efforts. However, upon revisiting it, I realized how much better it is. It features the usual Chaplin flare: humor, deep messages, and parodying. However, it has a spark about it. There's charm under this film and it proves to be the driving force of watching this.\n\nThe film begins in a chaotic manner, starting off with the end of WW 1. Following a dimwitted Jew, the war ends precisely after he saves the life of a German (or Hynkeloid?) soldier. After the war ends, peace resumes for a while before the dimwitted Jew is being harassed by German soldiers. Meanwhile the new dictator of the fictional \"Tomannya\" has risen to power and is asking for the trouble. There's much more to the plot than this, but I'd rather leave it at that. One cannot discuss this film without discussing the ending speech. Chaplin purposely breaks character to talk to the people of Tomannya and (more specifically) the people of Germany. The iconic speech is very straightforward, and very blunt. However, the one complaint I have about this film is, in fact, the speech. It felt very obvious what he was trying to do, causing it to feel forced. Plus, the fact that Chaplin broke character hurt a bit. The entire film we were led to believe this character was dumb and all of a sudden he's smart and very articulate? It's very strange. Also, there is a moment where something outrageous does happen, but it would involve me going into spoiler territory. \n\nWhere this film does shine is in the humor! Chaplin has always had a great sense of incorporating satire and humor. Slapstick has a strange vibe with me. I love it, but yet it's very childish. However, it's great. Another thing I can say is that Chaplin sure had balls to release this film during 1940. He risked his career, and yeah, this film did kill his career, combined with the accusations of his communist beliefs. However, you must admire his courage. Also, the film is beautifully shot. Yeah, it's black and white, but the cinematography is outstanding, especially considering the time period. Overall, if you're one to love slapstick, bold movies, and just Chaplin himself, the Great Dictator is a worthy film to watch. It features great acting, humor, and just has balls. To release a film like this, especially in the time period. That takes a lot. Even Chaplin himself thought of not releasing it cause of the controversy it might cause. Unfortunately, he was right and it was the beginning of the end for his career.

He was capable of understanding better than anyone the social realities he was part of and made one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films I've seen. Giving his character who had been silent up to that film such an important speech was such a powerful and historical moment in film history. I don't know why I always believed Chaplin was one of those directors that never managed to handle the transition from silent films to talkies very well, because ironically this (his first complete talkie) is my favorite film of his. The way he was able to use his physical comedy with as little dialogue as possible and then add some funny lines was a beautiful touch. He said what he could with his physical performance and then used sound to say what actions couldn't tell wholeheartedly. Chaplin had proved that actions speak louder than words with his Tramp films, but when those words are in tune with actions they can blow you away and that is how I felt with The Great Dictator. In 1940 no one knew about the horrendous crimes the Nazi's were going to commit against the Jews, but Chaplin was warning the world from the beginning how hate and racism could destroy the world. That powerful speech continues to resonate with audiences almost 75 years later and you can add that scene to Chaplin's wonderful legacy in film. There are several other memorable scenes in this two hour film (the longest Chaplin film I've seen, yet probably the one I would be most likely to rewatch), mostly all involving Chaplin's wonderful physical comedy as he makes fun of Hitler. While the entire world seemed to be ignoring Hitler and Mussolini's abuse of power, Chaplin courageously was warning us in the best way he could, through slapstick comedy, about their horrendous racial beliefs and the dehumanization it would lead to. \n\nThe film opens during the First World War where a soldier (Charles Chaplin) who is later introduced as a Jewish barber, is saving the life of a pilot named Schultz (Reginald Gardiner). They escape on a small plane, but eventually they crash and the barber loses his memory. Several years later he is released from the hospital but everything has changed. They lost the war, and Dictator Adenoid Hynke (also played by Charles Chaplin) is now rebuilding the country of Tomania. The Jews in the ghetto are being discriminated and treated poorly by Hynke's soldiers and the barber has no clue as to what is going on. A friendly neighbor named Hannah helps him, but there is not much they can do against the soldiers. When he gets into trouble with some of them, the commanding officer arrives and it happens to be Schultz who immediately helps the barber and offers him and the people in his ghetto protection. For a while things look good for them, but when Dictator Hynke discovers Schultz is helping the Jews he sends for his arrest and the Jews suffer persecution once again. Hynke plans to rule the world so his first step is invading Osterlich, the place where Hannah and her family were forced to flee. Things aren't looking good for the Barber and his friends, but keeping his head up and joining forces with Schultz, they are ready to make a stand.\n\nThe Great Dictator was truly a delightful and joyous experience. I don't know why I liked it more than his silent films because I really enjoyed all of them, but there was something about The Great Dictator that just hit all the right notes with me. I fell in love with this film and will definitely recommend it as my favorite Chaplin film. I wasn't considering watching his next two talkies, but after the experience I had with The Great Dictator I'm definitely considering watching them. I loved the way Chaplin clearly stated his beliefs in this film, mocking Hitler and his inhumane ideas with a courageous performance considering no one was doing anything to stop him at that time. But it's not just a brave film, it is really funny as well and I found myself laughing throughout many scenes. His physical comedic talents can still be seen in this talkie; one of his most memorable scenes involves a globe dance sequence. Paulette Goddard, who was also in Chaplin's Modern Times, gives yet another sweet performance, and Jack Oakie will forever be remembered for his role as Napaloni, Dictator of Bacteria, which was a clear lampoon on Mussolini. This was one perfectly executed satire that happened to come along at the right moment. Unlike in other politically correct films, Chaplin makes it evident that ridiculing Hitler was his main objective. It is a classic and a must see for film lovers everywhere.",

            "content": "*THE OFFICIAL BETTER THAN JUNO SEAL*\n\nIf someone ever asked me to list some of my favorite comedians, I would have to list Charlie Chaplin around the top.  Chaplin's slapstick humor, combined with his small frame, really provide a good laugh for me.  If there might have been a complaint anyone has had with him, it might be the lack of sound within a good bit of his films.  Nonetheless, they were still excellent.  So, here we are with Chaplin's first ever all-dialogue film: The Great Dictator.  When I had first watched this film a few years back, I found it to be among Chaplin's weaker efforts. However, upon revisiting it, I realized how much better it is.  It features the usual Chaplin flare: humor, deep messages, and parodying.  However, it has a spark about it.  There's charm under this film and it proves to be the driving force of watching this.\n\nThe film begins in a chaotic manner, starting off with the end of WW 1.  Following a dimwitted Jew, the war ends precisely after he saves the life of a German (or Hynkeloid?) soldier.  After the war ends, peace resumes for a while before the dimwitted Jew is being harassed by German soldiers.  Meanwhile the new dictator of the fictional \"Tomannya\" has risen to power and is asking for the trouble.  There's much more to the plot than this, but I'd rather leave it at that.  One cannot discuss this film without discussing the ending speech.  Chaplin purposely breaks character to talk to the people of Tomannya and (more specifically) the people of Germany.  The iconic speech is very straightforward, and very blunt.  However, the one complaint I have about this film is, in fact, the speech.  It felt very obvious what he was trying to do, causing it to feel forced.  Plus, the fact that Chaplin broke character hurt a bit.  The entire film we were led to believe this character was dumb and all of a sudden he's smart and very articulate?  It's very strange.  Also, there is a moment where something outrageous does happen, but it would involve me going into spoiler territory.  \n\nWhere this film does shine is in the humor!  Chaplin has always had a great sense of incorporating satire and humor.  Slapstick has a strange vibe with me.  I love it, but yet it's very childish.  However, it's great.  Another thing I can say is that Chaplin sure had balls to release this film during 1940.  He risked his career, and yeah, this film did kill his career, combined with the accusations of his communist beliefs.  However, you must admire his courage.  Also, the film is beautifully shot.  Yeah, it's black and white, but the cinematography is outstanding, especially considering the time period. Overall, if you're one to love slapstick, bold movies, and just Chaplin himself, the Great Dictator is a worthy film to watch.  It features great acting, humor, and just has balls.  To release a film like this, especially in the time period.  That takes a lot.  Even Chaplin himself thought of not releasing it cause of the controversy it might cause.  Unfortunately, he was right and it was the beginning of the end for his career.  I highly recommend watching this film, if not for the humor, but just to get a taste of what it must have been like for these people.  It's worth your time!",

One aspires to take over the world, while the other just wants to live his life free of oppression. It is to Charlie Chaplin's credit that this film is able to speak to the human heart in such a moving way, which is what it's all about. Charlie Chaplin gives two excellent performances as the dictator, Adenoid Hynkel, and a Jewish barber. Both roles give him an opportunity to display the physical comedy which he was already so famous for. He also gets a lot of laughs by ranting in pseudo-German. The rest of the cast also do well in their roles, particularly the actor who played Benzino Napaloni (a parody of Mussolini). There was also some great cinematography and set design. The only minor thing I felt was wrong was the opening sequence, which I felt dragged on a little too long. Still, it was a nice throwback to Chaplin's previous silent movies and had some nice sight gags (really, there was quite a number of hilarious sight gags throughout). Overall, this should be seen by any self-respecting movie-lover, if only for the impassioned speech at the end, which ranks as one of the greatest movie speeches I've ever witnessed.",

These two scenes tend to leave an indelible mark on people according to many reviews of the film.\n\nI found myself rather intrigued by Chaplin's grip on and understanding of the dangers of Nazism in 1940.  Though he was not aware of the true atrocities of the Holocaust (he said he never would have made the film had he been aware) he took a very brave stand during a time that the US was somewhat neutral in the war.  Couple that with the fact that he saw the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will and saw an opportunity mock it rather than cower in fright the way some did in the western hemisphere and Chaplin, possibly unknowingly provided some great ammunition on the world stage.

Ironically, the dictator scenes hit the funny bone more often than the barber scenes (the globe scene is awesome, and I can actually imagine Hilter doing that). But - even with some pacing issues, and being a bit too long - the film is never less than fascinating - slamming satirical needles into the pincushion of fascism at every opportunity. The satire is dropped for that stunning, famous final speech. No more slapstick, just a down-on-his-knees-plea to the world to wake up and stop hating. Still relevant to many people today, sadly. Yet those that will watch it...Charlie's preaching to the converted. Sigh...",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin, in his classic comedy released on the eve of World War II, is a biting satire of Hitler and the Nazi Party. Chaplin plays dual roles, Adenoid Hynkel, the dictator of Tomania, and assumes his trademark \"little tramp\" character, an unnamed Jewish Barber who is released from a soldier's hospital after suffering from amnesia in WW I and returns to his shop in a Jewish ghetto.  The movie pretty much follows the broad themes of 1930s Germany including spoofing Herman Goring and Joseph Goebbels -- Field Marshal Herring and Herr Garbitsch in the movie, the crackdown on Jewish individuals and businesses, and the alliance with Benito Mussolini - Bacteria's dictator called Benzino Napaloni, and the invasion of Austria. \r\n\r\nThere are several memorable scenes in the film including Hynkel's speaking before a throng in a gibberish-like parody of German, \"translated\" at humorously obvious parts in the speech by an overly concise English-speaking news voice-over. In one scene we see Hynkel dancing with a helium filled globe.   There are numerous scenes with Napaloni, his inner circle, and between the Barber and the regime's Storm Troopers that are pure slapstick and could have been lifted from a Three Stooges movie.\r\n\r\nThe end is noted for its obvious political overtones.  Hynkel, for some reason goes on a duck-hunting trip, falls overboard and is mistaken for the Barber and is arrested by his own soldiers. The Barber, who escapes from a concentration camp absent mindedly assumes Hynkel's identity and is taken to  make a victory speech. Garbitsch, in introducing \"Hynkel\" to the throngs, decries free speech and argues for the subjugation of the Jews. The Barber then makes a rousing speech, reversing Hynkel's antisemitic policies and declaring that Tomainia will now be a free nation and a democracy. He calls for humanity in general to break free from dictatorships and use science and progress to make the world better instead.    It is up to the viewer to determine if Chaplin meant this as an indictment against the Fascist nations or if he was including a broader charge against capitalism as well.",

In his final film portraying the part that brought him so much fame, Chaplin really knocks it out of the park. Developed as an answer to the tyrannical rantings of Adolf Hitler in the last 30s/early 40s, it would later grow into the primary template for the modern political film, and the most prolific movie of its era.\n     There are some truly fantastic films throughout his whole arsenal including the classic \"The Gold Rush\" and more hidden gems like \"The Kid\", but with this film Chaplin went beyond his standard level of greatness and created a film that still resonates with us today emotionally as well as politically.\n     Two scenes in particular stand out above the rest, however. One is where the dictator is doing a beautiful dance with a large balloon of Earth. It symbolizes in the most non-violent, beautiful way just how power-hungry and prepared to conquer the world Hitler was. The second scene is at the end when Chaplin takes the stage with a beautiful, heartfelt speech about the truth of human empathy. It's enough to make you cry. Maybe.",

As powerful in its message of international brotherhood as it is downright funny, with a very creative brand of satirical comedy that sees not only Chaplin take on his Hitler inspired role in an iconic way, but also Paul Oakie as the Mussolini inspired figure a worthy support act.",

            "content": "Putting Charlie Chaplin into an Academy Award nominated satire of Adolf Hitler, The Great Dictator sounded like a true comic masterpiece.\n\nLike most Charlie Chaplin films, The Great Dictator if a film very much of its time. As the time of Adolf Hitler's rule is now long in the past and socially acceptable comedy has changed, the shock effect of the film is no longer in play. Instead, it stands out as one of Charlie Chaplin's most bold decisions which maintains neverending relevance to both the world of cinema and the genuine. His writing is extremely brilliant.\nThe screenplay reduces the concept of Jews vs. Nazis to a mere game of high school bullying. As much as this oversimplifies the true nature of the racial conflict that occurred in WWII, it just goes to emphasize how arbitrary and ridiculous the concept of racism is. The antagonists have no sensible reason to antagonize, and their stupidity is too obvious. Most people in the modern day know that the concept of racism is plain ridiculous, but the fact that as far back as 1940 Charlie Chaplin was able to examine the concept and depict it as a childish game of bullying is just plain brilliant. He admitted that he never would have made the film if he knew of all the suffering that would happen in the holocaust, but we as viewers can remain so glad that he did. This theme transfers into the narrative during the first half of the film which is more slapstick oriented, while the second half of the film becomes a lot more focused on satirizing real life dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. I feel that as effective as this is, the second half of the film does not translate to modern day too well as it requires a more extensive understanding of history to truly appreciate. While the hilarious slapstick of the first half is more inclusive to any viewer, the second half is where things slow down and Charlie Chaplin becomes more focused on delivering a genuine political statement with his film. It is very respectable that he did this, but the shift in tones can be a little jarring for viewers who paid limited attention in history class. In that sense, I can't say that I understood every satirical element of the film. But I appreciate the man's best intentions.\nAnd underneath the complex politics of The Great Dictator lies a very fun movie. Despite its edgy setting, Charlie Chaplin's passion for creating the finest vaudevillian comedy for the cinematic screen is not forgotten. In actual fact, he combines his slapstick antics with a new level of production values and is able to offer a much larger comedic spectacle than ever before. His physical antics are transferred into a lot of large scale production design and scenery, successfully transferring the into a believable context. Seeing the man's iconic slapstick against the backdrop of a war satire is just plain hilarious and there is a strong quantity of hilarious slapstick sight gags to lighten the mood in the face of its complex political context.\nMuch of the comedy in The Great Dictator is very theatrical. All the humour is captured through a series of extensive shots which show extensive effort of rehearsal on behalf of the talented cast. Little editing is required because the cast members all work perfectly together, and the lighthearted nature of the comic life is emphasized through the use of a classical musical score. The slapstick moments have detailed technical value to them, but it is largely Charlie Chaplin who is owed the credit for his physical effort in them.\nCharlie Chaplin's dual role in The Great Dictator can be summarized by the titular adjective. Working his usual vaudevillian shtick, Charlie Chaplin's hilarious physical energy caters to fans easily. And yet, this time his role is so much more. As Charlie Chaplin is the second most iconic man in history to maintain the toothbrush mustache, it is an utmost necessity to all comedic existence that he parody the most iconic man, Adolf Hitler. And without making light of the suffering faced by the Jewish people, Charlie Chaplin plays an everyman caught up in the war who embodies the man's Tramp stereotype. And in a turn of events, when attempting to capture the madness of Adenoid Hynkel  Charlie Chaplin is able to really unravel himself into moments of insane dramatic strength which reaches the point of almost being intimidating. And yet, neither of these moments are the endeavour of his acting effort. That comes when he is told to deliver a monologue to the people of Germany. His monologue at the end of the film is a perfect summary of everything happening in the world of 1940, a chance for Charlie Chaplin to really stand up and say that unity of humanity is the only true path to a good world. In the most realistic moment of Charlie Chaplin's entire acting career, the man shouts this speech straight through the lens that he stares at and reaches out to viewers with the most genuine passion for every word. For Charlie Chaplin's first talking role, he speaks unforgettable words of wisdom at this very moment which is clearly the greatest moment of acting in his entire career. If Charlie Chaplin's hilarious slapstick as the Jewish barber and intense dramatic strength as Adenoid Hynkel wasn't enough to warrant an Academy Award nomination, then the timeless monologue he delivers to bring The Great Dictator to a close surely is.\nJack Oakie also delivers a solid performance. Although I'm not too familiar with the mannerisms of  Benito Mussolini, Jack Oakie's flamboyant physical energy follows on with Charlie Chaplin very well. He is hilarious of his own right, and the quality of the chemistry he shares with Charlie Chaplin gives the man a worthy comic adversary to bounce off of. Jack Oakie delivers arguably one of the most memorable performances from a Charlie Chaplin movie not to be delivered by that man himself, and so his Academy Award nomination is a fine piece of recognition for his talent.\n\nSo The Great Dictator does require a bit of historical knowledge and it has a lot of ground to cover, but with brilliant political commentary combined with hilarious slapstick, Charlie Chaplin keeps the film hilarious and legitimate at the same time while delivering his all-time greatest performance.",

It's fourth-wall breaking, certainly, but through the characters journey (foregoing the expected \"Prince and the Pauper\" riff until the very end), the moment feels earned. \n\nIn retrospect, the film can feel doubly more uncomfortable in the face of present knowledge of the of the events of the Holocaust-- something not afforded to Chaplin and his crew, making many of the injustices on display feel positively quaint in comparison to the impossible horrors of real life-- but to me, it has only increased the power of this, the most ambitious and brave film of Chaplin's career, and an absolute triumph of satire, comedy, and heart-wrenching drama.",
