What had begun as a vehicle to enhance Mickey Mouse's career blossomed into a full-blown feature that remains unique in the history of animation.",

            "content": "As someone who grew up to become a musician: there are certain modes and progressions used in the compositions for this feature that are linked to feelings I had while watching this as a child even though I long forgot the scenes and scores from the film. For example, the 2/2 tempo of marching in a particular way as well as the diminished scale being used to depict certain images and color is how I feel and what I envision when I hear them in other mediums and also when I use those techniques while writing. \n\nI couldn't remember much of it from my childhood until I watched it as an adult and suddenly most of it came back to me. This is not your usual movie or feature as the introduction states. It is a modern symphony that nearly perfectly matches the animation you see. You feel the story and the music similarly at the same time. It actually can feel so sensually overwhelming that you become numb to it, at which point you may find yourself bored. \n\nIf for any reason while watching this, you stopped feeling things from the music and imagery I would suggest pausing and coming back to it when you aren't distracted or have a clear mind. That being said, it seems like the type of feature you could play a couple of times a month in the background for a child to help them develop a sense of feel and emotional connection to certain aspects of music. In that way, it is to me truly magical.\n\nI rated this film in comparison of any other entertainment. Truth be told it is in a category of its own. I would give it a 5/5 for what it is. But, I would not want to watch this often as a main feature because it is as intense and interesting as it is easy to disengage from. \n\nAgain, it's in a league of its own. It is perfect for what it is. I want to rate it higher but I have to be fair to other content.",

            "content": "Fantasia is so educational, and I was gob smacked by how well the animation mixed with the classical music. Can I also say that Leopold Stokowski is one of the best conductor of the 20th century, right on a parallel with Herbert Von Karajan? I was listening to Sibelius's 5th symphony a few years back, and he conducted it the year before he died, and he was in his 90s. Not only that, but that was the best version of that symphony I had ever heard. Back to Fantasia then. Each piece was expertly introduced by Deems Taylor, and unlike its sequel didn't take too long.(Even the soundtrack vignette was interesting) In the sequel, almost half of the film felt like too much introduction and not enough music. Fantasia rectified that problem brilliantly:\n\n1. Bach's Toccata- Brilliant silhouettes of the orchestra, and then masterful abstract images. The orchestra played the piece to a phenomenal standard, and I hate to say this, but I actually prefer the piece orchestrated. It was originally written for organ, you see. The best thing about Stokowski is that you see him conducting without a baton, which is exceedingly clever.\n\n2. Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker- I recommend you see the ballet, because it is a knockout. This is coming from a classical music lover. The animation was superb in this vignette. The most impressive thing though was the fact that the finishes immediately went into the next scene, without it being hackneyed. The waltz, or Dance of the Snow Fairies, was the highlight of this vignette, reminding me so strongly of Christmas.\n\n3. Dukas's Scorceror's Apprentice- The most famous vignette, is the only vignette to feature in the sequel. YenSid(Disney backwards) has a magic hat, which he leaves lying around, and Mickey Mouse picks it up, and encounters various problems. the animation is very good here, and while I'm not a huge fan of the piece, I still found it enjoyable.\n\n4. Stravinsky's Rite of Spring- This is the only reason why the movie isn't a 10. This vignette is far too long It's longer than the Beethoven. It is an interesting subject, dinosaurs, but the ballet wasn't simplified enough. This was boring, and was better left out. It was only here to give some historical context. However, there was beautiful animation and some lovely instrumental solos. Stravinsky hated what the film did to his work, but anyway I don't like Stravinsky much. I had no problem with the animation or the way it was performed, it was just too long.\n\n5. Beethoven's pastoral Symphony- This is a fantastic piece of music. I am a huge fan of Beethoven, and I have all his 9 symphonies on my IPod. My favourites are this, the Choral and the Eroica. I loved the fact that they chose a Greek mythological setting, because it looked gorgeous. My dad who is a conductor wasn't keen on the centaurs, but I loved the winged horses, Bacchus and Zeus (who competes with Chernabog as the most frightening character of the movie). This vignette was so relaxing to watch; think it as like reciting a poem.\n\n6. Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours-This was the funniest vignette of the film, and one of the many gems of Disney. It was a bit unrealistic of course, but it was fun. At first, I was worried that the most famous scene from the opera La Giaconda, would be ruined by the animation. But it wasn't. It was perfect. Even the elephants and hippos, considering their size, danced so elegantly, I was shocked. This vignette is a must-see if you want some comedy.\n\n7. Mussorgsky's Night on Bare Mountain- Now this was my personal favourite, as when I first watched it when I was 10, and I was terrified of Chernabog. The music is also very hard to play, as the mood is very hard to capture, but this is undoubtedly the finest recording of this music. Chernabog was genuinely frightening, and a masterful creation. And the animation, while dark, matched the music, which is enough to give you nightmares, flawlessly. It was very like a Witch's Sabbath, which was what the composer originally intended. Do you know, that for his underrated fantasy movie Legend, Ridley Scott based Tim Curry's Darkness on Chernabog? Children may find it a bit too frightening, and adults may find it inappropriate, as there is a tiny glimpse of nudity. But it was still an effective vignette, and one of my favourite Disney moments actually.\n\n8. Schubert's Ave Maria- This is a beautiful song, and Stokowski did it justice. The harmonies and animation were perfectly captured. how could you say this was boring? The animation couldn't have been happy looking, it would have completely ruined the mood of the song. It was beautifully sung by Juillietta Novis, who was so quiet that you had to turn the volume up, but that was the intention. The thing that impressed me most, was the complete contrast of this from the Mussorgsky, so the key of Ave Maria was so well chosen. (It is sung in many different keys.) In conclusion, the most underrated of the earlier Disney efforts, is well worth watching and a true animated classic! Also I was offended by the review that said that it was the worst movie ever made, and that the people who love this movie need new taste, that is plain insulting to anyone who grew up with this film. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",

These are minor quibbles when confronted with the breathtaking artistry that dominates the movie.  At the time the movie was made, the Disney factory was at the absolute peak of its powers.  Fantasia exhibits a stunning attention to detail that would never again be duplicated (owing to it's initial box office failure).  The Sorcerer's Apprentice remains a tour de force of music, character animation, and photographic effects.\n\nNevertheless there are some dry spots.  \"Dance the Hours,\" with its dancing hippos and alligators is funny but drags on longer than necessary.  The Pastoral is the blandest sequence; its scenes of teenage centaurs courting one another are more reminiscent of prom night than ancient mythical worlds.  Seen decades later, much of the films imagery continues to astonish, even when compared with modern, computer enhanced extravaganzas.",

            "content": "Animation is an absolutely incredible art since its beginning, as well as all the great artists that represent it in cinema, without exceptions.\nBut of course the name the Walt Disney will always be associated with classic animation since the creation of Mickey Mouse in 1928 which has established him as an Animation Master unparalleled in history. But it was around 1938 when Mickey was losing ground to Donald Duck. Disney had the right vehicle for this: an old Goethe poem known as; The Sorcerer's Apprentice (also inspired by the song of the same name by Paul Dukas).\nFor this somewhat daring feat, he also considered the conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra, conductor Leopold Stokowski who immediately made himself available to work together and suggested that instead of making a short they could together develop a full-length film. Disney agreed.\nAnd so it was that Walt Disney dared once again to innovate and even challenge its artists to what would eternally go down in history as the first full-length film that would combine animation with classical music with a selection of 7 scores from the best known and most famous composers of all times.\nWhen I watched Fantasia in 1985, I was 18 years old and I remember that I had bought my first VCR player and I was choosing very judiciously what I should watch. I had seen some excerpts from the movie on some television specials at the time but hadn't seen the full movie until then.\nI believe that the first copies that the local video store had were not the original version and should have been edited because young children certainly didn't have the patience to watch a cartoon that didn't have action and dialogue. Not to mention the final episode where a demon appears on top of the mountain in one of the most interesting animations ever made so far. I remember my mom didn't like me watching it when I was little because I didn't sleep well when I watched horror movies and for her that part was one of them.\nBut it is clear that this movie is imposing and certainly audiences at that time did not understand how Disney came out of films like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio that appealed much more to children and the family in general, went for something so serious and eclectic. Glad he did it.\nBach, Tchaikovsky, Dukas, Stravinsky (the only living composer at the time), Beethoven, Ponchielli, Mussorgsky and Schubert these were the composers selected by Disney (who loved classical music and that's why the LA Opera in downtown Los Angeles bears his name), Stokowski and Deems Taylor (famous radio announcer who hosted Metropolitan Opera concerts).\nI consider this film as a good wine... as it ages, it is better to be appreciated. With a few exceptions, the film as a whole enchants and the animation is extremely sophisticated for the time. I can't help but appreciate every moment that something different is present like fairies, abstract waves and light effects, fairies skiing in the snow and gently touching the leaves of the trees as the seasons change, flowers sliding in the water as if they were in a cabaret, dinosaurs fighting for their own survival only to culminate in the cosmos of extinction, Greek mythology revisited with centaurs, winged horses and the drunken God of Wine, alligators, ostriches, elephants and a female hippopotamus dancing ballet and weighing less than a feather in movements delicate and mind-blowing. Not to mention that this is the only feature film with the participation of Mickey Mouse in his most celebrated film as an inexperienced magician and a broom determined to never stop working. At the end, for me the best part of all is a parade of macabre demonic creatures that at the end of their act gives place to the bells of a distant cathedral in which a procession of lights gives an ecumenical sense of praise to the heavens. And I praise the skies a million times to thank all these talents who made it all possible back in 1940 to the eternity that only imagination and animation can bring.\nI can't help but admire Walt Disney's courage and determination to produce something so sublime that I don't even think he knew what it would turn out to be. Of course, the movie was admired by some, but it did not yield a profit, on the contrary, it caused a lot of damage to the studio, but like all masterpieces it surpasses time and is consecrated with new and old admirers like myself.",

One, this film is a complete turn from what they did before with Show White and Pinocchio. With those two films, it has a definitive story, and though not deliberately, they want you to feel a certain way about characters. However, with Fantasia, the entire point is that there isn't a story and that you can feel anyway you want about a specific segment, which I absolutely love. For example, the dinosaur segment, it doesn't matter how many times I see it, I still don't know how to feel about it. If I had to pick my favorite segment, it has to be the ending with the Night on Bald Mountain and the Ava Maria. It's dark, it's mature, and it's arguably the best animated segment in this entire film.  And you can feel the exact opposite way that I feel, that's what makes it so great. I guess the other thing that makes this my favorite is that this is the best hand drawn animation that Disney has given us, and you can't prove me wrong. Even if I watch the best Disney movies by the critic reviews (Disney Renaissance films), I still don't think it's gonna be better then this. I'm not sure if this is confirmed or not, but this feels like the only Disney film that's 100% for adults, so it can make you feel more mature if you do watch it and enjoy it (like myself). Not to say kids can't watch it, but it doesn't feel targeted to them like Snow White and Pinocchio. Man, I could talk about this film all day, but I can only go into so much detail about it, you know? The only proper way to enjoy this movie is to go to Disney+ and watch it for yourself. It's my favorite, and I hope it's the same for you!",

A person, like me, who does not like classical music and prefers a \"real\" film with a plot is obviously not going to get in the mood with the film.

            "content": "Before talking about Fantasia I want to talk about Fantasia 2000.  I saw Fantasia 2000 on release weekend in IMAX theaters.  It was a massive event, they used every aspect of the theater.  Full scale of the surround sound, and even projecting events from the film in shadows around you in the theater.  It was a singular moment in time that will not be repeated.  I say this to say that while Fantasia is obviously a much better movie, I liked Fantasia 2000 more because that event experience really is how this type of movie is meant to be experienced.  I have a big TV, but it doesn't matter.  Unless you have a massive screen, and a great sound system, it's just not the same, it's that type of movie.  It's replicating the experience of going to a concert, and like going to a concert, watching a taped version at home just isn't the same.  I really wish I could experience this in theaters.  At home, a lot of it gets pretty boring honestly.  Funny enough the second half is where most of my favorite segments are, but even then most of those segments really start to overstay their welcome after a while.  Now all that being said, I can't really fault the movie too much, it was made at a certain time for a certain medium, that being the theater, and that it doesn't work as well at home isn't so much the movies fault as it is an impossible ability to have foresight.  Also, it's still a worthwhile experience.  There's something about the way hand-drawn animation looks that's just beautiful.  You can see the individual cells here too overlapping, and it's gorgeous in its intricacy.  Some segments overstay their welcome, others however are just perfect.  The Night on Bald Mountain section is absolute stunning perfection and one of my favorite things Disney animation has ever done.  So for me, it's a mixed bag.  When I saw this movie years ago, I didn't particularly like it, but even in my child mind I felt something akin to respect for it.  I knew, even as a kid, that it was something important movie even if it wasn't a movie that grabbed my attention.  Years later, I like it a little bit more, but more or less feel about the same.",

Fantasia is simply great art. Utilizing fluid, impressionistic hand drawn animation alongside superb classical music, Fantasia reaches into Walt Disney's imagination and splashes vivid colors and fantastic images of all manner to accompany legendary suites.\n\nFantasia may have bankrupted Disney, forcing them to create Dumbo and Bambi to recoup their losses, but Fantasia remains Disney's most ambitious, creative, and artistic piece. Fantasia essentially invented the music video with these sequences as they animated each scene specifically with each classical piece in mind. It's a mind boggling accomplishment when you witness the glory of Disney's gorgeous Fantasia. I personally adore The Sorcerer's Apprentice short film with Walt Disney voicing Mickey Mouse himself!\n\nWalt Disney recruited his usual cast of superb directors of animation with Wilfred Jackson and Ben Sharpsteen among several others for riveting shot choices throughout each sequence. Sweeping camera movements, dark silhouettes, shadowplay, bursts of vibrant colors, and creative sequencing form Jackson and Sharpsteen's stellar direction for Fantasia. Stephen Csillag's seamless edits flow effortlessly in his cutting of Fantasia. Joe Grant and Dick Huemer's writing is nice for the few verbal storytelling parts. James Wong Howe's cinematography is really beautiful and wondrous with stunning wide shots everywhere.\n\nThe music of Fantasia is an obvious draw with Walt Disney using a plethora of iconic composers from the world over including: Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Johann Sebastian Bach, Modeste Moussorgsky, Igor Stravinsky, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Amilcare Ponchielli, and Paul Dukas for Fantasia's musical backdrop. Deems Taylor's narration and introductions are wonderful with his calming voice and informative perspective on musical history, musical composition, and world cultures. Taylor was the perfect choice for Fantasia's narrator. Leopold Stokowski's passionate conducting keeps you engaged with his hand waving as he leads the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIn all, I love Fantasia for trying to entertain and inform families about science, culture, art, and animation all in one crafty picture.",

There's no real story to this film outside of the stories that are featured on screen to each piece. Really, nobody had seen anything like it before, and at a time when the conventions of filmmaking were very rigid and conservative, it really was a mixed bag for many audiences. Today, however, as genres have diversified, we're used to seeing things we've never seen before. Films in general have become less predictable and less dime-a-dozen. \"Fantasia,\" save for its 1999 sequel \"Fantasia 2000,\" is certainly not one of those dime-a-dozen films. Even today, it is a very unique film -- both in its content and its influence. It's safe to say that Walt Disney's gamble paid off big time.",

Freeing their animators to take some legendary classical music and create a visual depiction of what they hear/feel is an interesting experiment. I also appreciate that they all have a unique feel, as none of the songs (or cartoons) are similar to the ones that came before. But, despite my interest in what they tried to do, I didn\u2019t have a strong connection to the end result. I do appreciate classical music, but I connect more to the orchestra playing it and how it makes me feel. The first song in the film made this obvious to me, because this is where they centered the visuals primarily around showing the orchestra playing the tune. I was able to marvel at the skill they showed, and let the music take me on whatever emotional journey I felt at that time. It was my imagination in control and not the Disney animation team presenting me with dancing mushrooms or crocodiles. When presented with a cartoon, I\u2019m taken out of my own connection with the music and focus solely on the visual story the animators drew from the music. Most of these stories are simplistic or nonsensical and in a way they minimize the magic of what the composer created. That\u2019s not to say that the visuals aren\u2019t charming and fun, but they simply can\u2019t measure up to Beethoven, Stravinsky, Schubert, and all the others. I think the one piece that came the closest to evoking a feel on par with the music was the Night on Bald Mountain sequence. That\u2019s the one that clicks the best out of the bunch. I don\u2019t hold anything against Disney for trying something different, in fact most of us would think it\u2019s pretty awesome if they attempted something this bold nowadays, it\u2019s just that this particular experiment didn\u2019t work as well for me. I\u2019m not one of those people who call it \u201cboring,\u201d but it\u2019s just not for me.",

            "content": "Walt Disney strived to create some of the best content when concerning animation. He stunned audience's ears with 1928's \"Steamboat Willie\" becoming the first ever cartoon with synchronized sound. He defied the movie industry with the first ever feature length animated movie: \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" in 1937. And in 1940, Disney did it again with two features: \"Pinocchio\" and \"Fantasia\". And while \"Pinocchio\" may have been given appeal to families, \"Fantasia\" appeals to everyone. While it may not have been a huge success during Walt's time, in more recent years, the movie has gained quite a bit of attention, mostly in part due to the artistry that went into making the film a reality. Since its inception, \"Fantasia\" has been regarded as Walt Disney's masterpiece; a very notable fact. In fact, out of all of the animated films that the Disney company has released, \"Fantasia\" is my personal favorite for reasons I will explain below.\n\n\"Fantasia\" is a masterpiece of cinema. From creating stereo sound, to making a more modern interpretation of Mickey Mouse, \"Fantasia\" defined what Disney was capable of. It starts off with a collection of people sitting down to perform an orchestration of great classical music under the guidance of Leopold Stokowski. And from there, brilliance is included.\n\nThe film is divided into eight unique animated segments; each one standing out from the rest. Here they are with a brief analysis of what they represent and mean.\n\nFirst, Toccata and Fugue in D Minor by Bach. After a brief interlude of the orchestra, the animators take control and produce a series of abstract images that do not tell a complete story. Lines and shapes take the stage, all of which intertwine with the beautiful colors from all of the artists working at the Disney studios. There is no real story; just let the eyes and ears feast on the magic being presented before you.\n\nNext, The Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky. A series of dances set to fantastical images, quite literally. We see fairies, flowers, fish, and the mushrooms come to life through magic, as unique and wonderful things happen. Starting with fairies dancing on flowers just to make them look beautiful, the scene transitions to dancing mushrooms, flowers performing ballet, fish slowly dancing to music, Russian roses, and finally back to fairies to turn autumn to winter in one of the most beautiful transitions ever. This segment showcases the fantastical side of nature, without showing a single nutcracker. This segment makes one feel like they are at a concert in real life.\n\nNext, The Sorcerer's Apprentice by Paul Dukas. This is the most infamous segment of the entire program. Mostly because, it features Mickey Mouse, and everybody knows him. This one tells a more cohesive story- a young apprentice dabbles with magic, and unfortunately cannot control it. Mickey Mouse is given a better design, thanks to animator Fred Moore, and returns to the mischievous mouse from the early days of his career. What else can be said? The Sorcerer's Apprentice is something that everyone has seen, and is pretty iconic. Also, the wizard in this segment is named Yen Sid...\n\nNext, we have the Rite of Spring by Stravinsky. Here we see the evolution of Earth from its primordial stages, all the way to the age of the dinosaurs. Here, we see how terrifying early Earth was as interpreted by science and animation. The dinosaurs might not be the most realistic when it comes to interpretation, but the designs are truly worth noting. Plus, this segment is the most mature out of all of them, and that is fine with how things are represented here as the mature nature only brings up more questions younger viewers may not have the answers to.\n\nAfter a short intermission, we get some fun with the soundtrack, and what sound looks like.\n\nSoon, we get The Pastoral Symphony by Beethoven. Here, we see a day in the life of several mythological creatures, and some Greek gods. This is one of the more comical segments, as the movements of the characters due have that cartoonish feel to them. On top of this, the segment does contain the most creativity that Disney's animators had conceived.\n\nNext, it's Dance of the Hours by Ponchielli. This is the most humorous segment out of the program. Instead of having something serious, we are offered a collection of animals dancing to various times of the day. We have ostriches, hippopotamuses, elephants, and crocodiles representing various times throughout the day. And it's all done via comedy and dance.\n\nFinally, we have two very contrasting pieces: Night on Bald Mountain by Mussorgsky and Ave Maria by Schubert. On Night on Bald Mountain, we witness the demonic Chernabog raise evil creatures to to watch them suffer for his own amusement. Only until church bells ring out does the party end, and Ave Maria comes with a group of religious individuals holding candles signifying the sunrise. This is the darkest segment of the entire program as there is a lot of dark elements present, and even some scary images that might terrify younger viewers. However, with Ave Maria, the darkness is taken away to bring forth calmness and tranquility, and the short ends on an iconic view of the sunrise thanks to the multiplane camera from Disney. This final segment makes a bright contrast between light and dark in a very effective manner.\n\n\"Fantasia\" uses all of these segments to create a unique blend of music and animation. Nothing had been done like this before, and it is hard to top it since. There had been other films that have copied the style used in \"Fantasia\", like \"Allegro Non Troppo\" and this film's sequel \"Fantasia 2000\", but nothing can top the original. \"Fantasia\" blends animation and music so perfectly, it invented the modern music video as we know it. The movie is a milestone in cinematic history, and it should not be ignored.\n\nRunning at two hours long, the film can be a bit slow at times. But as it is trying to emulate the feeling of being at a concert, that it to be expected. The long run time is needed for this type of film. It makes the viewer comfortable enough to know that they will be in for a long time, and that they should use their time wisely.\n\nBut of course, this is a movie where the animation is the main star. Every segment has a different style to it, and each one works effectively. There isn't a single segment that looks  out of place, nor do they feel dated.  \"Fantasia\" brings forth everything Walt Disney was trying to accomplish with his team of animators in bringing the impossible to life. And they succeeded.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Fantasia\" is an ambitious project that Walt Disney made, that still holds up to this day. Each piece of classical music is unique and stylized in their own way, and each showcases various styles of animation. \"Fantasia\" not only is a great Disney film, it's one of the best films period.",

            "content": "If I was to look up the word masterpiece in a dictionary, I better expect to see a picture of this movie attached to it. If there is one duo of giants I think go together so beautifully and would be able to express their mastermind combination, it's Leopold Stokowski and Walt Disney. Out of all the Disney films, this may be the one to be the closest to animation perfection, synchronized so cleverly and beautifully with the score. The pacing is one of the greatest things of Fantasia. It may sound strange to say, but it's true, every very-well-storyboarded sequence is planned out at the right speed, and executed wonderfully onto animation. All I have to do is meditate with my eyes open while watching the majority of the sequences, and it'll make me feel content and emotional at the same time. An uncommon combination that results in one of the greatest feelings I've ever felt. It almost makes me want to get in there myself and either be a part of the band or play a part in an animated sequence. When I think of an adult film, this is that special Disney film that comes to mind. I would definitely show it to kids as well to see what their idea of it is. People underestimate kids, they think that it will bore them, but don't come to conclusion so quickly. My personal favorite is the last two sequences of the film. Let's say that you died, and you accidentally went to Hell. You come across the devil and witness some of the most beautifully-animated graphic imagery I've ever seen. Then, the sound of Church bells compel the devil, and you are then taken into God's hands through the Ave Maria. It's such a wonderful, wonderful experience of a couple of sequences in a movie that it almost made me cry. The wonderful singers of the Ave Maria leave me with nothing but a genuine smile on my face. I also truly admire how there are different scores for each sequence. The first part of the Rite of Spring segment has more of a brass, low-toned sound to it that really matches the animation on the dinosaurs. Which, by the way, the animation on the dinosaurs is fantastic. Then again, the animation of this entire movie is not just a masterpiece, but in literal meaning, it is a master's piece. You can tell a story without having to directly tell a story at the same time, and that's what this film manages to exceed at. It lets you experience the emotions of the characters or even of nature through the animation and musical score, combined to make you feel awestruck by its brilliance. Fantasia is one of my all time favorite Disney films. It's not my actual favorite, but it's up there in the top 10. I never fall asleep watching this film, it just pleases me with its artistic merit driven by its variety in character expressions and style along with the brilliant score. If you do fall asleep while watching it, please, take it to your advantage. Let yourself fall asleep to the music, because doing that will let you see such wonderful, very-detailed sequences of abstract thought in your head, and what's wrong with that when it's where creativity can blossom. An underrated classic.\n\n4/4",

As a series of various episodes, that it leaps to, from one symphony to another, it usually grows off putting as there is no flow or a mutual aspect as a lose thread for the audience to hold on to, but not this time, not in here. Among multiple musical acts, the first two focusing on tiny little aspects of the nature that is explored with an awe-struck beauty depicted with suave animation and bright heart pleasing colors is a testament to the fragility and ingenious minds.\n\nAnd among such animations too, the makers have managed to tell a tale depicting the mundane life of each being contributing equally and thoroughly to the nature itself. Misusing the power achieved or stolen temporarily, Mickey Mouse is on run, salivating to use the magic for his best, finds himself on a self created conflict, circling the arc of a complete tale narrated within few minutes. Personally, the Dance Of The Hours, is something that felt over thought out and naturally didn't buy into it, on the other hand, The Rite Of Spring balances the tone with stunning visuals and fluently depicting the transaction over the time.\n\nThe climatic tale featuring the night and day concept through an exhilarating metaphor, ends this film on the highest note possible. Aforementioned, as much as rich the film is visually, the music is jaggedly on mark that elevates the momentum of the chapter discreetly and as a whole. As usually these Disney movies contains, the tale has a range to adore its younger audience and push the mature one, the balance is soothing to encounter. Fantasia is one of the finest classics of Disney that is equally competent to the ears as it is illuminating to our eyes.",

Taking short Walt Disney Studio animation shorts and pairing them to compressed classical music pieces performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra was an extremely ambitious undertaking in 1940. The animation is extremely impressive for its time as it features Disney's signature character Mickey Mouse in 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' segment as well as using pioneering sound reproduction system that made \"Fantasia\" the first commercial film to use stereophonic sound. This was Walt Disney's masterpiece that uses music to express imagination and feelings together with animation.",

            "content": "\"Fantasia\" is a classic but it is not without its faults.  This huge undertaking tackles eight pieces of classical music in their entirety, but there comes a point where this feels like the longest Disney movie ever.  Its highs are really high and its lows are pretty low, from The Sorcerer's Apprentice (my personal favorite Mickey Mouse cartoon of all time) down to the slow-moving Toccata and Fugue that shows little more than superimposed images of the orchestra in Technicolor.  The entire film is incredibly creative with a vast number of characters, memorable moments that will forever come to mind when their respective song plays, and the transformation of some pieces of absolute music into program music.  The lowest point of the film is the evolutionary interpretation of The Rite of Spring.  Dinosaurs are cool but this sequence is terribly boring.  There is also way too much time spent giving this an authentic concert feel with lengthy introductions for each piece, an in depth explanation of the soundtrack, and even an intermission.  This is evidenced by the fact that subsequent releases of the film edited out the majority of the introductions in favor of a more compact musical presentation.  I prefer the more family-friendly \"Fantasia 2000\" that focuses on the music, cuts each piece to an appropriate length, and animates its sequences with memorable stories.  The film does successfully bring its musical selections to life as the colors in each scene reflect the mood of the music and the pieces are given some sort of story.  The various nationalities represented in The Nutcracker Suite are cleverly given their ethnic characteristics, though the racial representations went a bit too far in Beethoven's 6th Symphony (and have since been edited out).  The Beethoven is great when the cartoony unicorns are flying around but the centaur love sequences and drunk god of wine detract from the whimsy.  Seriously, so much nudity with those centaurs.  The Dance of the Hours provides the iconic ballet-dancing hippos and elephants that bring some much needed comedy to the latter half of the film and the Night on Bald Mountain sequence continues to be one of the darkest moments in all of Disney animation.  As I mentioned, the highlight is The Sorcerer's Apprentice.  This marks the first appearance of the redesigned Mickey who now had pupils to allow for a greater range of expression.  The colors are vivid, the story is fascinating, and it is perfectly in sync with every musical cue.  It is no surprise that this sequence has influenced rides and shows at Disney parks as well as being reused in \"Fantasia 2000.\"  You will be hard-pressed to find a better Mickey cartoon than this one.  I know that I should claim this as my favorite Disney film because of the attention that it brings to classical music but I do find it to be longwinded and that it might actually cause younger kids to dislike classical music.  Parts of the film are entertaining but the feature as a whole is cumbersome, even for some with two degrees in music.  \"Fantasia\" is a film best suited for classical music experts and die-hard fans of Disney cinema.  Everybody else should defer to the pared-down-but-equally-significant sequel that captures the essence of Walt's concept without the length, borderline inappropriate imagery, and questionable message of evolution.",

Most of my friends and colleagues praise Fantasia for its beauty and realism, for its soundtrack animation tie in, etc. I found Fantasia to be incredibly boring, aged, and slow paced, not having a real story and having most of its animation sequences unamusingly long.\nFantasia has no real plotline. The concept is classical music pieces by Beethoven or Bach set to animation, or as our only talking character in the film, our conductor, calls it \"what you may experience in your mind sitting in an opera house\". Most of these pieces and animations are based on tales and some on real events, some with impressive animation for its time and some feeling forced. Nonetheless, Fantasia failed to amuse me. Even if it is considered one of the great animated films, it hasn't aged well at all. Even with impressively done colors soaring by in every scene, the slow pace is distracting and the sequences feel overly long. There is no story and little to no dialogue. Normally I don't mind little dialogue. Silent films can prove dialogue can be prevented and a film can be compelling and have a legitimate story. Fantasia just feels very personal in the eyes of Disney. He considered it his best work in his years of animating but it's a movie you either love or hate. The eyes that see it as a cinematic great are targetted closely. Its target audience following Snow White especially is complex. If it failed to amuse me then how would kids enjoy it? 60 years after the original, Fantasia 2000 was made not just to cash in on celebrity cameos but in a sense to recognize it is a family company, not just in the eyes of Walt, and make a sequel to appeal more to kids.",

I was well fascinated by this sensational production as a very young child and I would do almost anything to have it be as well known today as it was many years ago. I especially enjoy the more abstract moments throughout the film mostly considering the introduction of the presentation, with the in-depth look at the imagination of what we may visualize when we hear not just classical music, but just about any well crafted song out there. The rest of the tracks apply the same basic principal, but mostly containing stories of interest. The Rite of Spring (the birth of living species) and The Pastoral Symphony (Mt. Olympus) are two of my top favorite tracks in this unforgettable production. Fantasia 2000 was a good sequel, but the original shall stay the best for me. The subjects of beauty and mythological fantasy need to be reminded again in this generation. A fun and childhood-classic Disney film overall.",

Like I said, for what it was at the time it was a game changer and I still think it is. The animation is incredible. All the hand drawn work was stunning and was given life to what it was portraying. The synchronicity between music and animation were flawless. They were totally in synch and due to the great pieces and animation were given life as I said before. Each of the pieces had a story to tell and I loved most of them. The best ones were the obvious Sorcerers Apprentice choice, the unicorn and mythology one, and a night on bald mountain. While I did like all the pieces, some of the stories were kind of weak. The dew fairies and dinosaur one at first I didn't find to have strong stories or nearly as interesting. The weakness of the stories kind of lead to me losing interest at points in them. The narration in between each piece I really liked and I thought gave the good stories better background to work with and I found his voice pretty calming as weird as that sounds. I can't really say a ton about Fantasia as a whole because I can't say characters worked well together or had good dialogue because there wasn't any. Technically you could call this a concert or showcase movie. Despite some scenes losing my interest, Disney made a really great animated film that is a total landmark in animation and film in general. B+",

            "content": "Possibly the greatest achievement of Walt Disney and his studio, Fantasia is a great movie, because it really isn't a movie, but but short segments separated by a brief description of the next segment and shots of the orchestra. Since I'm feeling daring today I'll briefly review each segment.\n1: Toccata And Fugue In D Minor: The strangest of the segments, as a third of it is just artsy shots of the orchestra, followed by very strange, abstract imagery. It definitely works, as it all gels with the music, beautifully conducted by Leopold Stokowski. 9/10\n2: The Nutcracker Suite: One of my favorite segments, the visuals work so well with the animation on this one, as it shows fairies changing the seasons, mixed with dancing mushrooms, flowers, fish and everything else imaginable. 10/10\n3: The Sorcerer's Apprentice: Definitely the most famous segment, people who haven't seen the movie know Sorcerer Mickey standing high on a rocky podium of sorts, lighting the sky and raising the waters below. I love the animation, and I love seeing Mickey. 10/10\n4: The Rite Of Spring: instead of the original dances that went with the piece, the animation tells the story of the Earth's beginning. though I love the segment, it's a little too long, and almost 25 minutes. still, very great and breathtaking: 9.5/10\n5: The Pastoral Symphony: Definitely my least favorite segment, the music doesn't work with the animation, it's too cutesy, and is overly long. It's enjoyable, but not as much as the others. 8/10\n6: Dance Of The Hours: This one is the most comedic segment in an otherwise \"Highbrow\" film, and yet it works incredibly, and is one of the best segments in the whole film. It keeps the piece as a ballet, but is danced by animals instead of people. What makes it work is it's choice of animals. Ostrich's (Morning), Hippo's (Afternoon), Elephant's (Evening), and Alligator's (Night). the ending is comical, as is the whole segment. 10/10\n7: A Night On Bald Mountain/Ave Maria: Wow. Just, wow. this piece is... just amazing. A Night On Bald Mountain is simply terrifying at times, while Ave Maria is one of the most beautiful things Iv'e ever seen. the film benefits from no end credits or goodbye from Deems Taylor, Master Of Ceremonies, but rather just ending when Ave Maria is over. Overall, this is one of the most beautiful films ever made, and is my favorite Disney film. A perfect 10",

The animation is superb, especially when you consider it was done in the 1930s! Hard to see you can tell the difference between then & now... Some of the shorts are not too kid friendly, especially the demon at the end, but some are cute, while most are just plain weird! A deserved classic, but probably not for everyone.",

            "content": "Timeless.  Putting music to pictures, Fantasia animates classical music to a variety of different segments, some telling a story, some just being a series of abstract images.  I recall watching this movie a number of times on VHS in my adolescence, and upon rewatching this as an adult, I think it still holds up.  Not everybody agrees with this opinion, because this is on Premiere Magazine's \"The 20 Most Overrated Movies of All Time\" list.  The section that everybody remembers fondly from this is \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", where Mickey Mouse borrows the sorcerer's hat, animates some brooms to complete the chores that he is not interested in performing, until the point where it inevitably backfires.  It's easy to see why it is so adored, as it is the one with the clearest cut story.  There is a very defined rising and falling action, and it is the piece that is easiest to identify with.  However, as far as what I would consider to be my favorite, I would give the edge to the finale, \"Night on Bald Mountain.\"   It depicts a gargantuan demon summoning spirits during a sinister night in a mountainside town.  It's really not for kids (despite me initially watching this before I turned the age of 10), but it is strikingly memorable, and it's like watching a vivid animated nightmare of somebody who is worried about being damned to hell.  Every single one of these seven segments has a lot of personality, and they all stay with you long after you have walked away.  From the history of the world, showing the dawn and the demise of the dinosaurs, to the centaurs and fauns having a raucous party until they have to weather a Zeus lightning storm, from hippos dancing with alligators to the opening number where music is put to what your brain might imagine sounds to look like, a lot of work went into the artistry of this, and with fantastic music backing this up, I do consider this to be mandatory viewing.",

But what I like the most is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.

It also helps when you add music to it which really matches the story and not majestic style but creativity and imagination to flow, which is one of the major points of this movie combining imagination with film (which I'm pretty sure we've all done that).\n                                                                                                                 the second major the other is that its pretty much for adults, true there is some amounts of kids in it as there is adult style. one being the begining piece where it is trying to give you an example of what fantasia is, the other two which are my favorites are the rite of spings, and the night on bald mountain are the big adult pieces in this movie (in my opinion), because of what there about where springs is about the evolution of earth so its very nature styled and survival is everywhere making it everyman for them selves. Bald mountain however is about heaven and hell yes that is literally true just listen to the two music pieces in the story and you know what i mean.\n                                                                                                                                           But that is like the main reason why I love fantasia, it allows thought and thinking imagination and life. When I first sawed this I thought it was going to be like its sequel but no it was way deeper so deep it actually scared cause I did not know what to think about rite of springs or bald mountain due to how dark and real it was until know.

This is one of the greatest achievements made to tell a story through forging visuals and sound. Many different moods are expressed in a visually fantastic manner: horror in Chernobog during \"Night on Bald Mountain,\" jollity in the plump flowers during \"Nutcracker: Russian Dance,\" whimsy in the dancing hippos and crocodiles during \"Dance of the Hours,\" mystery in the sparse opening during \"Toccata and Fugue,\" despair and defeat in the life-evolved-into-dinosaurs during \"Rite of Spring,\" magic in Mickey Mouse and the wizard/conductor during \"Sorcerer's Apprentice,\" etc. Besides \"Ode to Joy\" and \"Dance of the Hours,\" the film hardly indulges in cutesy Disney fare. It felt like a fine art piece in motion.The animation is so beautiful, especially since it was made in the dawn of technicolour. Since colour in a motion picture was so new back in 1940, the opportunity to colour the scenes is used both economically and fruitfully. More clearly, how colour was used back then somehow strikes me much more than how colour is neglectfully used in modern animated films. Then again, Fantasia is not very subtle. Occasionally, I did not understand what was happening on screen at all, but the music (keep in mind that it's not an original score) distracted me from that due to the exquisite blend of the art and sound. Between pieces, the director, Deems Taylor, interjects with some information about the next piece to be played, and we sometimes see the orchestra play around with their instruments before performing. In theaters today, Fantasia would be like a live concert, with the curtain closing on the orchestra as they play over projected animation. What a way for people of any age to fall in love with these classical music pieces, too. I might secretly prefer watching this again in separate segments, but the diversity of content also makes for a visually stunning, singular viewing.",

The result was an animation which was unlike anything done at the time. The film is introduced in segments by American composer Deems Taylor, and the film begins with the orchestra playing Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, then an animated take on Nutcracker Suite by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky with dancing flowers and leaves. Then, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, which needs no introduction. Then the big bang theory with Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky, after an interval, we have a take on Beethoven's The Pastoral Symphony with fawns. Then Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours with animals doing ballet, then the rise and fall of darkness with Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky and Schubert's Ave Maria. It was a brave thing to attempt a film like this back then. While it would have been groundbreaking back then, it does look twee and a tad dated now, especially when you consider where animation has gone since then. The episodic format works against it, but it is lovely to look upon at times.",

The people behind this movie made various animations that they felt went along with several classical musical pieces. The best segment out of all of them is the very last one with the devil. It was incredibly atmospheric and well done. The Sorcerer's Apprentice bit was good for a laugh, and the abstract pieces at the beginning did a fine job at letting the animator's creativity flow. There isn't anything bad about the film to be honest. It just isn't something you can watch a whole lot. It is an undeniably important film and I think people should still watch it.

The music is perfect, the art is perfect, the animation is perfect, so why a 9.6 instead of a solid 10?  The whole point of this picture was to transcend the audience into a two-dimensional world of sound, colour and inspiration, all from the passion and imagination of Disney and his team of great artists.  In other words, immersion.  That spell that had been put upon the viewers is broken after every two or three segments or so when Deems Taylor appears in the orchestra pit and discusses the following segments as if he were a school teacher.  Why did he have to reveal the segments that were coming up?  Instead of surprising the audience, it just built an expectation which might lead to the spectators being a little dissapointed.  It just takes you right out of the immersion, which you should NEVER do when you're making a movie like this (or any movie).  Such a journey through a fantasy loses its interest when rudely interrupted.  Luckily, the fantastic work presented from the artist, animators and musicians still kept the magic rolling and got us back on track.  Such an amazing and superb film.  Bravo!",

Then you gotta pay for the privilege\" mentality that Disney has developed over the years it truly highlighted here. The movie itself is overrated, over-long and aimed purely at classical music lovers, and I can only wonder how many children this bored to death over the decades. Between each segment the conductor waffles on describing the very simple story you're about to see (thanks for that) and the segments themselves are a mixed bag. The Mickey part is good, along with the dinosaurs and devil parts, but many of the others are just too dull, overly simplistic or hardly anything brilliant. Overall it is very well made and certain parts are still impressive, but the length is overindulgent by a least half an hour and it becomes a chore to sit through, and I doubt many kids, if at all, could make it through until the bitter end.",

And it's great, it works and the magic is even as it starts. However, there were two segments which i had problems with, mostly because it affected my experience on this movie. These two segemts are: The Pastoral Symphony and Dance of the Hours. The first one had imagery that's...questionable, and i'll leave it to that. The second was more strange than artistic, i mean, there's dancing Hippos with tutus, Aligators trying to get a hold on elephants, the previously mentioned Hippos and ostriches...i know it's fantasy, but that's more a mind-screw than imaginative. To redeem myself, the rest is incredible, specially these ones:\r\nThe segment \"Meet the Soundtrack\" was actually very charming and imaginative, and the segements \"Night On Bald Mountain\" & \"Ave Maria\" are simply some of the best Disney has done on its entire history as of 2014. Fantasia is extremely superb.\r\n\r\nUnlike any other Disney film, Fantasia is special. Gets the artistic affair right and has one of the best movie scenes ever in animation history (the Ave Maria). A true masterpiece of music and imagery, better than any music video.",

            "content": "A masterful and gutsy undertaking in the world of animation, Fantasia serves as an experimental blend of visual storytelling and classical music without the need of dialogue. Not well-received in 1940, the film takes a laudable stab at the overly-conservative cinematic world at the time, with sequences depicting a godless evolution, hallucinatory waves of colors/shapes, topless (and sometimes nude) female figures, and a demon tossing souls into hell for his own amusement. Much of the animation work, from the free-falling leaves and seed pods tended by nature fairies in Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite to the dancing hippos and elephants in Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours, to the gothic grotesques in Night on Bald Mountain to the classic Greek creatures of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, was the inspiration for disney artists for decades to come; these sequences were strong influences on such Disney efforts including, but not limited to, the tranquil Bambi, the slapstick Dumbo, the flittering pixie in Peter Pan (and the later Tinkerbell direct-to-video-sequels,) the semi-gothic Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, and, of course, Hercules. Unlike the later sequel Fantasia 2000, this original work does not rush the melodic performances, as many sequences are quite long. Young children may be bored. The animated sequences match the music SO well, it is hard to imagine that Walt Disney's visual narrative was not the original intention of composers. An example would be Igor Stravinsky's Rites of Spring, as each note, each drumbeat is matched through dinosaurs' snapping jaws and swinging tails. I can imagine this song no other way.",

The film is really just an ode to Disney's love of animation, music, nature, and the strangeness of reality; it features every attribute of great Disney films, except it is far more visually stunning, almost to the point of overflowing your senses. Also, it is among the trippiest films I have ever seen, so I definitely recommend it to any stoner film lover, but it will appeal to anyone who watches it. The only mistake Disney made was making this film 2 hours long, I dont think many viewers these days have the attention span to watch a film with no dialogue for that long.

Walt thought that it would be a good idea to incorporate some heavy animation with some classical music, which would entertain the audience for two hours, and he succeeded. \n\nThere are seven segments in the film:\n1. Tocatta and Fugue, which showcases some bizarre abstract images, but very impressive.\n2. The Nutcracker Suite, featuring dancing flowers, mushrooms, and fairies, plus the changing of the four seasons.\n3. My personal favorite, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, where Mickey Mouse attempts to control magic.\n4. Rite of Spring, which shows the creation of the Earth and the rise and fall of the dinosaurs.\n5. The Pastoral Symphony, a segment featuring Greek gods, centaurs, and cherubs.\n6. Dance of the Hours, which features dancing hippos.\n7. Night on Bald Mountain, a creepy, disturbing, and emotional segment about a devil who unleashes the dead.\n\nFantasia is a fantastic movie. The animation is some of the most beautiful animation I've ever seen, and it's really something to hear that it came out in 1940. It's better than some of the recent CG animation in today's time. The music is also a stunning treat for the ears, and without it, Fantasia wouldn't work.\n\nAlthough this is a Disney movie, I do not recommend this film for young kids. Some of the selections could be too long that it could bore kids, while others would be scarred for life if they saw Night on Bald Mountain at a very young age. Like it's said on recent TV shows, viewer discretion is advised.\n\nIn the end, while others rank Snow White or Pinocchio as Walt Disney's greatest achievement, I believe that title goes to Fantasia, a film with hard-to-beat animation and phenomenal music.",

The prologue explaining the movie is also bone dry and humorless. \n\nAs a more mature foray into art and music fantasy, Disney further missed its mark with careless racist and sexist references (as it often does) in Beethoven's \"Pastoral Symphony\" with the specifically colored horses and in \"Dance of the Hours\" with the offensive and alarming gender roles.

Fantasia is beautifully animated, clean, and has perfect music to capture emotion in each story.  The film works perfectly when both the story and score work together equally well; which leads to the only problem, sometimes the score outshines the story, or vise versa, thankfully that problem isn't drawn out to bad, but when it's obvious, it's very obvious.

It's a visionary music extravaganza from Disney's wondrous imagination. Although it's not flawless since you have the orchestra music and the art expressing it, the pace throughout is slow.

Fantasia features several acts or sequences involving abstract waves and patterns floating , fairies and dancing plants, a mostrous dark spirit looming large while unleashing darkness and a whole mythological paradise with centaurs and little cupids played out with a live orchestra performing works of Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Stravinsky and many more. Fantasia is like being sucked into a vortex and being dumped out on the animator's bizarre but mesmerizing fantasies! There is of course the legendary Sorcerer's Apprentice sequence where Mickey has one hell of a ride!",

            "content": "\"Fantasia\" is an animated masterpiece that features great music, brilliant visuals and a lot of imagination. Every animated segment features classical music but the animated visuals that accompany them are all distinct and unique. All of them are really memorable and they'll really stick with you, from \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" to Beethoven's \"Pastorale Symphony\" with all of the centaurs and greek mythology figures and of course, there's no way you could forget the \"Night on Bald Mountain\" segment. Some of the animation is really groundbreaking too. Remember that this is way before computers entered the world of animation so every bead of dew, every splash of water, every cloud and translucent shade is hand painted and in many instances not just a cell of solid colour that was painstakingly coloured, but a fully rendered piece of art (complete with shading) that is flipping by so quickly between other images that they look like fluid movement. This isn't a film that's meant to appeal to a children's audience while the adults are off doing their own thing. If you're a big fan of music, or music videos you'll appreciate the musical and visual choices made here and you'll be able to recognize the work that's been invested into making the film. If you are showing it to children they'll really be entranced by the merging of music and animation and in the case of the abstract segment, it could easily make them think about music and colour in entirely new ways. \"Fantasia\" is an absolute must-see and a really unique animated film that will turn you on to music and to visual art if you aren't already a fan.

By blending famous pieces of classical music with animation stories in a feature length film, Disney not only proved himself an artist as well as a successful producer, but also one with a belief in the medium as a creative medium rather than a mere cinematic gimmick. It is arguably with Fantasia that the animation genre was given the credibility that ultimately made them relevant in the cinematic landscape. Some of the segments in this film are particularly memorable, including the famous one which stars Mickey Mouse as the sorcerer's apprentice. This film is not only a feast for the eyes but also a treat for the ears. Magical.",

This is Fantasia and Walt Disney could not have picked a better title for this masterpiece and to think that it was made in 1940.\nThis movie is 73 years old and the animation can easily hold up with todays cartoons.\n\nAlthough it's Disney I would say that you can't watch this as a child and understand what you're seeing. Sure, every child has seen the story with the sorcerer's apprentice and everyone knows the dancing flowers and hippos but there are scenes which many haven't seen yet, due to many tv stations only showing parts of this great movie and never showing it in it's entire lenght. The thing is, a child could never ever possibly comprehend what Fantasia is showing us. Even adults have a hard time with it, I myself as well. But I really enjoyed watching it, always wondering what would come next.\nThis is a movie for adults who love art and music.\nThe combination of the animation with classic music from Bach, Tschiakovsky, Stravinsky and many other well known composers is just genious. There is no other way to describe what you will see in this movie.\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it.\n\nYou will hardly ever see an animated movie in this league. Fantasia is big, sucks you in and will have you wondering what you just saw, for the rest of the evening.\n\nI don't care what anyone says, but this movie is a 10 / 10. Must see.",

Humor, sorrow, anger, and contentment swirl throughout the entire experience, and a couple of these vignettes are notable Disney classics in and of themselves today.\n\nFantasia started my love for the fusion of music and visuals, and as a creative person I have looked to Fantasia as a source of inspiration. It transcends logic because it appeals directly to the emotional sense, penetrating even the roughest exteriors and taking its viewers on a ride through the right side of their brains.  As such, it's difficult to explain it on a technical level, especially considering its uniqueness in the film industry. This was a bold move for Disney and would still be a bold move today that honestly may be bashed by critics and audiences alike for being too different. That's not taking into account the awesome wonder of the experience, however. It's still a work of art despite its different nature.",
