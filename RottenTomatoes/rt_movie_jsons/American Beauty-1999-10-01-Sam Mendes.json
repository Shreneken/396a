Fed up with his boring, stagnant existence, he quits his job and decides to reinvent himself as a pot-smoking, responsibility-shirking teenager.

            "content": "American Beauty is a timeless masterpiece that explores the complexity of the human psyche and the emptiness of suburban life. Directed by Sam Mendes and written by Alan Ball, this film is a true cinematic gem that offers a profound and thought-provoking meditation on the nature of existence.\n\nThe story follows Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man who is stuck in a loveless marriage, trapped in a soul-crushing job, and alienated from his teenage daughter. However, everything changes when he becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend, Angela, and starts to embrace a rebellious and carefree lifestyle.\n\nKevin Spacey delivers a stunning performance as Lester, capturing the character's vulnerability, frustration, and longing with impeccable precision. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Annette Bening as Lester's neurotic and controlling wife, Chris Cooper as the homophobic and abusive neighbor, and Thora Birch as Lester's troubled daughter.\n\nWhat makes American Beauty truly exceptional is its ability to blend humor, drama, and social commentary in a seamless and captivating way. The film is filled with memorable scenes and poignant moments that stick with you long after the credits roll, from Lester's iconic \"I'm just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose\" monologue to the haunting image of a plastic bag floating in the wind.\n\nOverall, American Beauty is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it has received over the years. It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates great filmmaking, complex characters, and deep philosophical themes. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible. You won't regret it.",

All six main actors portray their chracters memorably and effectively outline their changes in perspective towards life. To be completely fair, this is also thanks to an extremely well-written screenplay, a masterclass in the principle of \"show, don't tell\".\n\nIn conclusion, this movie is much more than the story of a man's midlife crisis and holds up extremely well after more than twenty years.",

The story mayn't be original at first glance, but how the film is written and constructed more than compensates you completely overlook. You may argue the characters are weird and unlikeable, maybe so, but they are quite complex. Lester is a self-described loser who is unwanted by everyone, Carolyn is uptight and sexually frustrated, Jane is the epitome of a sulky teenage daughter and Allison is like a incipient Lolita who Lester becomes smitten with. American Beauty is probably an example of a movie that you may need to see more than once to truly appreciate it, I was like that with Vertigo.\n\nWhat I love about American Beauty is not only the complex characters, but also the stylish filming, haunting score, side-splitting scenarios, the intelligent and darkly funny screenplay and the assured direction from Sam Mendes. Not to mention the performances which are nothing less than impeccable, especially Kevin Spacey who thoroughly deserved his Best Actor Oscar. Annette Bening, Peter Gallagher, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari give wonderful support too. Quintessentially, American Beauty is just a wonderful, funny and brilliantly performed and directed film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I devote enough brainpower to keep up with a movie's plot and can sometimes pick out individual instances of good music, shot selection or (rarely) editing choices, but thinking of a movie in terms of its themes and motifs and its \"stunning visuals\" is just not something that I do. Spacey is by far the most disappointing casualty in the era of bad people suffering the consequences of their actions as he is surely one of the best actors to have ever done it. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the plot points of Spacey's midlife crisis, especially the ending, but I generally disliked Bentley's entire character, having found his shtick of filming people who were uncomfortable with it unrealistic and unlikable.",

Ever since watching this movie for the first time (which I think was in the early 2000's), I suspected there must be something seriously wrong with the writer, or the director, or perhaps the reviled actor himself. When the 2017 sexual allegations against Spacey came out, for some reason I didn't feel surprised, because the way he acted in American Beauty seemed -- too natural, too real. It turns out that Kevin Spacey is not acting in this movie; he's just being his natural self. For that reason, this movie left me with a very disturbed feeling, something I don't get from a horror film or a tragedy or something in the same cinematic class. What would drive a writer to create a depraved movie like this? Or what would lead someone like Kevin Spacey to accept the role of a depraved pervert for this film?

This movie not only glorifies pedophilia, but it treats it like no big deal when Lester decides he is done being a pedophile. While I thought this movie had some beautiful shots, phenomenal acting, and an original story, I can't overcome the fact that this movie treated a pedophile like a good person for \"taking control of his life.\" All Lester did throughout this movie was act like a child. This is a male manipulator classic. Lester is a grown man who ats like the world owes it to him to treat him like he's a 17-year-old. I have no idea what was going through Alan Ball's head when he wrote this, but it was weird. Of course, the women in this movie weren't good either, Carol cheated on Lester and treated her daughter jane like an employee. Carol was not great, but the difference between her and Lester was that she took responsibility. Even if she hated her life, she still toughened up and provided for her family.  When Lester got bored, he tried to f- a 16-year-old. This movie was okay, but it will never be above 2.5 stars on my list, I cannot justify pedophilia.",

            "content": "Sam Mendes' \"American Beauty\" is an intimate, heartfelt and deeply thought-provoking drama about the unseen beauty of American suburban life. With his directorial debut, director Sam Mendes crafted an unforgettable drama about a dysfunctional family in the midst of a mid-life crisis. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to humanize the lives of suburban American families, but he pulls it off seamlessly. Using captivating cinematography, Mendes draws viewers into the world of a middle-aged man that is stuck in a mid-life crisis. For a first-time filmmaker, Mendes shows exceptional control over the storytelling, technical aspects and performances. Alan Ball's screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses clever voice-over narration to put viewers into the mindset of an unhappily married father. It is hard to not admire the astonishing performances from the cast. Kevin Spacey delivers one of the best performances of his career as Lester Burnham. With mesmerizing expressions, he conveys the droll humor, loneliness and sexual frustrations of a middle-aged man that struggles to mend his broken family. The supporting cast, which includes the scene-stealing Annette Benning, is also excellent and worthy of recognition. Although \"American Beauty\" remains a powerful drama, ultimately it is not a flawless film. If there's a minor drawback to the movie, it often struggles to find a consistent tone. The film switches back and forth between moments of satirical humor and darkness, never quite achieving a balanced tone. Nevertheless, fans of family dramas will definitely enjoy \"American Beauty\" and so will movie-goers seeking evocative entertainment. At a time when Kevin Spacey remains a controversial public figure in Hollywood, it's a beautiful reminder that an actors' filmography is worth separating from his tarnished public reputation.",

            "content": "Sam Mendes' \"American Beauty\" is absolutely, positively one of the most unique films I've watched in a very long time. Mesmerizing, humorous, titillating, dramatic, and suspenseful, \"American Beauty\" is one of those rare films that genuinely works on multiple levels - and for that it rightfully earned its positive critical reception and its slew of Oscars. \n\nThe movie stars Kevin Spacey as Lester, a miserable middle-aged man who is not respected by anybody - especially not his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and teenage daughter, Jane (Thora Birch). Having been trapped in a loveless marriage for the past several years, Lester can't help but take an interest in his daughter's attractive friend, Angela (Mena Suvari). He begins to experience a series of risqu\u00e9 fantasies involving her, and her naturally flirty personality only perpetuates them. It soon becomes apparent that this newfound attraction has not only increased his sex-drive, but also provided him with the motivation to reclaim the good life he once had... and so begins the transformation of Lester Burnham. \n\nBut the movie doesn't focus solely on Lester; it branches out, giving a decent amount of attention to the character of Jane and her romantic encounters with Ricky (Wes Bentley), a boy living next-door to her. While he initially appears creepy and off-putting, Jane can't help but detect that there is something about him she finds appealing, so she gets to know him better. She learns that he certainly has some issues, but also has an empathetic, sensitive side of which she was hitherto unaware. \n\nAll of the aforementioned parts are played brilliantly by their respective actors. The most notable performance being Spacey's, as he manages to portray Lester as a likable underdog whilst also showing us his aggression, concupiscence, nihilism and volatility. It is made abundantly clear that there are no perfect characters in this story; they all have major flaws, and I can imagine most viewers will find at least one that, to some extent, resonates with them. \n\nI feel like I have a lot more to say about \"American Beauty,\" and I've been trying to  gather and organize the rest of my thoughts for quite some time now, but I've concluded that it's pointless. There's no way in which I can describe it in words without doing it an injustice. This movie is something special because it's more than a movie - it's an experience... and some experiences are simply beyond words.",

            "content": "\"American Beauty\" , written by Alan Ball, is a disturbing and engrossing film that pulls apart the American dream of middle class families and their lifestyle.  Ball uses symbolism, lighting, and each of the characters words and actions in order to explore different issues found within American society. Like other dramas \"American Beauty\" tackles and dramatizes the issues within what is considered to be the \"American Dream\". However, it uses each of the characters and their relationships to others in order to represent these certain issues. For example, Lester Burnham represents missed opportunities and unhappiness within his everyday life. Jane represents unhappiness with her physical appearance and her parent relationship.  Overall, I would give this film a rating of 3/5 stars. This is because while I enjoyed the symbolism and the issues pointed out about the American lifestyle it also normalizes these issues and portrays them as though they are nothing to fix or be ashamed of. Furthermore, this film dramatizes these issues and the main source of the main character development is a sexual fantasy about his daughters' best friend. However, this film had many memorable quotes and important lessons within it.  The film uses the color red in order to symbolize desire and overcome with passion and emotion. Rose is a common thread within the film as well. Used to indicate fantasy and passion. Rose can also mean secrecy within the film. The plot of the film moves notably slow until the last 15 minutes which are packed with twists and turns. However, the ending really gives the movie meaning and draws together what the movie had been showing the whole time. Like other parent-child conflict archetype's, this movie centers around unhealthy and struggling relationships. However, it adds complexity to each character showing the underlying issues and connections in all of the characters. All in all, \"American Beauty\" tears apart the fantasy of the American lifestyle.",

In the beginning, Lester (Kevin Spacey), Carolyn (Annette Bening), and Jane Burnham (Thora Birch) are trapped in a drab, hollow, and mundane suburban world where appearances are worshiped. Carolyn has locked her family up in her dungeon of high class success and magazine cover luxury. Later on, Lester escapes that society by quitting his job and falling in love with Angela (Mena Suvari), Jane's best friend. Jane yearns for her true self, so she hooks up with Ricky (Wes Bentley), the \"creepy guy with the camera,\" who has found inner beauty. Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper), Ricky's father, represses his past as a Marine and keeps his true homosexual self in the closet. Whether the choices Lester makes are uncomfortable or inappropriate, Carolyn's quick and shallow, or Jane's strange and confused, both characters' actions are based on the theme of self-acceptance dominating appearance. Also, the fact that both characters have different perspectives on beauty helps guide them to their desires, even if it is a videotape featuring a plastic bag caught in the wind. American Beauty is a harrowing film and one of Sam Mendes's best. It figures that his directorial debut feature is impressive, as well as audacious. \n\n(4 \u00bd Smiley Meals out of 5)",

We have Birch's character being very insecure and not fitting in to the family dynamics and her friend Suvari who only needs her to make herself look good. Large part of film explores what we don't see and what we don't know. Exploring what goes behind closed doors and what we portray to the world. The music and cinematography are very striking with the red and white used very well. We have different cameras from the handheld which appears slower and in slightly different focus than the film camera. There is a nice balance. Spacey's Lester realises he needs to change and longs for being younger and is frustrated about his life, his wife and his home.  He fantasizes about a young girl, takes drugs, gets fitter and gets a different job. Bening's character starts shooting guns and having an affair. We see Bentley and Birch's character find a connection. The street they live in is immaculate, the flowers and the cars stand out as sophisticated America with the most normal and boring characters being Jim and Jim. The acting and script is clever and very witty. There are many memorable quotes and songs throughout. Some of the conversations about seeing beauty in things might not be to everyone's taste. I enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed Bening and Spacey. The final 10 minutes is a nice built up as many characters come more out of their shell before the shocking climax. A well deserved Oscar winner.",

After I grew older and more mature I saw the bigger picture.\nMore than just the incredible shot composure and iconic cinematography (the girl covered in petals is one of the most iconic shots of the 90s and early 2000s) is the message it holds.\nAlan Ball (one of the people behind True Blood) wrote the movie in the early 90s and it shows how futile and hollow is life in suburban american neighborhoods. It also tackles feeling of imprisonment, redemption, conformity, repression and sexuality.\nA must see for everyone who hasn't had the chance to see it yet.

Kevin Spacey was his amazingly talented self, more likable than most roles where he has played a noteworthy super-jerk.  Annette Bening also put in an exceptional performance.  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari were all great.  Chris Cooper probably had the most memorable of all performances here playing the homophobic ex marine.  One interesting note, the last 20 years or so, because we have been progressing at such a rapid pace technologically, this movie has actually started feeling dated.  The story is still enjoyable, but I couldn't help but be taken aback at the cell phones and computer monitors etc.  This is not a criticism.  Rather, that this movie still doesn't feel that old in my mind but has these dated aspects was something of note to me.  Nonetheless, I loved seeing it again after such a long time.  *The notion that Kevin Spacey's character was paying 2 thousand dollars for a few grams of marijuana is patently absurd.  When and where was that the reality for anyone?  That's the only aspect that stands out as dumb to me.  Otherwise, this is a maintaining masterpiece, just stop making me feel the passage of time so harshly.  When I first saw this, I was a young 20-something.  Now I'm 4 years from being 50 years old.

He realizes that this isn't even really life. He wants to be better, he wants to feel alive, but even though he wants to do stuff that he hasn't before, he never does anything that could be considered bad. He is not a perfect protagonist, because sometimes he is a bit of a prick, but he is not a bad person.\nThat's why he feels like a real man.\n\nAnd this could be applied to every other character in the movie.\n\nCarolyn is always insecure, and she cheats on Lester. Jane is confused and doesn't really know what's her purpose in life, or what she wants to do, or be. Angela lies to herself, and other people, just so she can fake his confidence and hide her anxious self.\nRicky already knows what he wants to do, and he does it. But he has a father that is also confused about himself.\n\nI can't talk about the father, he's really confusing for me as well, but this is why he feels like a real person, along with everyone else. They all have flaws, and they do stuff that could be considered bad, but neither of them is really a bad person, they are just regular people. That's all. And people are like that. They are confusing and weird, but most of them are good.\nSome want stuff, and when they don't get it, they don't feel bad.\n\nYeah. But also the cinematography is amazing when it needs to be, all the performances were great, they all embodied the character really well, especially that fucker Kevin Spacey even though he is an asshole in real life. The music is very imperfect , and it's very surreal during the dream sequences.\n\nIt's also well edited and the symbol of the little rose-things as the joy and beauty in life is really touching and beautiful.",

He seems to be suffering from a mid-life crisis on that he is in a loveless marriage to Carolyn (Annette Bening), with one child who is at the puberty age, Jane (Thora Birch).\n\n\nCarolyn herself is an estate agent.

Going on a keep-fit regime and developing a dope habit in the process. \n\n\nAlso developing a new found confidence by telling bis employers a few home truths hence losing his job, buying an old car and 'bashing  the bishop' in bed next to his wife!\n\n\nDirector Sam Mendes is probably more well known to audiences for his James Bond film collaborations Skyfall and Spectre but this his perhaps his career peak film.\n\n\nWatching the strange interaction between the characters develop and their messed up lives. \nThe film develops into a shocking ending which I won't spoil but it is not what you expect!\n\n\nSpacey rightly or wrongly won the Oscar and at this time is probably his best performance aside The Usual Suspects from 1995.\nIf you have not seen this film, I strongly recommend.",

            "content": "I expected to love this film and I did, in between the awfulness of Dances with Wolves (1990) and Going My Way (1944) it was wonderfully refreshing to see a good, well made film that deeply explores modern sexual mores and family dynamics. Unfortunately the film is mired in controversy due to the presence of lead actor Kevin Spacey and although I am completely against the actions that he took in his personal life I would still urge people to watch this film because outside of Spacey it contains really great writing, direction and performances. Sam Mendes made his feature film directorial debut with this and I would have to say that this is my favorite of the films he has directed so far as he seems more focused here and deals with interesting characters going through mundane lives. I found the entire two hours to be highly entertaining but the ending to be emotionally affecting and I was surprised that I found it in myself to love these characters.\n\nLester Burnham, Kevin Spacey, is going through a mid-life crisis that has been spurred on by his meeting Angela, Mena Suvari, the attractive friend of his teenage daughter. He and his wife Carolyn, Annette Bening, have a strained relationship and he can't connect with his daughter Janie, Thora Birch, who has begun a relationship with her neighbor, drug dealer Ricky Fitts, Wes Bentley. Burnham quits his job, makes several purchases on expensive items and starts working out but as Fitts' abusive father Frank, Chris Cooper, directs his anger at Lester it is clear that it will all end in tragedy.\n\nSeeing a film set in a vaguely recognizable setting and featuring characters that I could relate to in at least some way was a huge relief. Burnham's actions are not endorsed as he is mostly mocked or pitied by the film for his childish and creepy desire for a teenage girl, his letting go of all responsibility and his treatment of those around him. Carolyn is also seen as an uptight and difficult to live with woman and Bening is great at making you root against her but she becomes humanized by the end of the film and her faults are understandable. The relationship between Janie and Ricky was also accurate to how a certain type of socially isolated teenager would fall for an equally discontented youth. Even the seemingly shallow and manipulative Angela is revealed to be vulnerable as she searches for approval in lascivious older men and is desperate not to be \u00e2~ordinary'.\n\nThe screenplay contains several great scenes but in particular I enjoyed the attempted reconciliation of Lester and Carolyn and the plastic bag scene. We are lead to believe that the Burnhams will be able to rekindle the love and passion in their relationship as they kiss on the couch but their canoodling is cut short by Carolyn as she asks Lester to put his beer down for fear of it staining the couch. Lester then yells at her about how materialistic she is but this belies his hypocrisy as he has bought an unnecessarily flashy car and purchased several items that he has valued over Carolyn. The plastic bag scene is all about living in the moment and being able to appreciate the beauty of everyday life no matter how small a form it comes in. Bentley delivers his lines as Ricky as though he's in a sort of trance, much like Allison Janney as his mother, with a complete lack of caring about how anybody else feels about the moment he had.\n\nAll of the performances were great, including unfortunately Spacey. Bening carries off moments that would seem terribly pantomime-y in the hands of other actresses and watching she and Spacey square off is terrific fun. Cooper is truly fantastic though as the scene in which he confronts Lester then attempts to become emotionally intimate with him was devastating as the at first relieved then shocked, humiliated and angered expressions on his character's face convey all we need to know. Cooper makes us feel bad for a man who abuses those around him and shows us all of the horror that repressed sexuality can wreak on a man's life.\n\n1999 was one of the greatest years in film history and therefore everybody has their favorites but personally I would have rewarded this film with Best Picture even though Being John Malkovich (1999) is equally as good.",

The story in this is great and flawless about Kevin Spacey as Lester Burnham narrating about his life. He has a wife, Carolyn Burnham played by Annette Bening who is an ambitious woman and a daughter, Jane played by Thora Birch who f**king despises her family. Wes Bentley as Ricky Fitts who is obsessively filming everything around his surroundings with his camcorder and he is curious about Lester's daughter, Jane next door. Lester hates his job, has a midlife crisis and becomes possessed with his daughter's best friend, Angela Hayes played by Mena Suvari. He starts having sexual fantasies about her, in which red rose petals are a recurring motif. As much as I love everything about American Beauty, this is something that I watch almost every night. It has that amazing impeccable cinematography that just makes the way the film looks satisfying like the red petals that Mena Suvari is laying on. That is the moment of beauty. \"Spec-tacular!\" The directing is really good. It's made by Sam Mendes who I assume who directs two James Bond movies like Skyfall and Spectre starring Daniel Craig. I was shocked by the fact that this was actually his first film which is quite a coincidance! I really, really love this film. It shows the characters how they're feeling and communicate with one another. Whenever you're think of American Beauty, you would be like, \"Wow! That is the most beautiful film I've seen!\" and it is a beautiful film with surprisingly dark humour, the acting is perfection, the story is well written, the cinematography is impeccably shot and it's definitely worth your five Oscars if you haven't seen it. This is one of Sam Mendes' incredible Oscar winning masterpieces! You have no idea what you're missing, I'm sure. But don't worry... you won't someday.",

American Beauty doesn't trailblaze a path into hitherto untouched cinematic territory, but its presentation of vivid characters in interesting situations makes the story seem fresh. In part because it's not a complete downer and in part because it doesn't cheat the audience, American Beauty is emotionally satisfying. There's a sense of poignancy at the end, but also the feeling that we have been on an incredible trip through the lives and souls of three perfectly-realized characters. In a year that boasts few truly memorable motion pictures, Mendes can stake a claim alongside the likes of Kubrick and Egoyan as one whose cinematic vision both challenges and entertains.

            "content": "1999 was a really good year for filmmaking. Many amazing hit movies were released that year, The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, Toy Story 2. Some movies released that year, people didn't like too much, but now it has a cult following, Fight club (one of my all time favorites), Eyes Wide Shut, The Mummy. And, there are movies released that year that many might say overrated, The Blair Witch Project, and the movie I'll be talking about today, American Beauty. This movie won best picture at the 2000 academy awards, and I found that out before watching the film. Throughout watching American Beauty, I kept wondering to myself, HOW DID THIS MOVIE GET BEST PICTURE WTFFFF. Well, I guess the academy awards in 2000 just thought that a movie like American Beauty is outstanding. As you can tell, I'm not a particularly huge fan of this movie. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, because it's not, but I don't think this movie is a masterpiece as some people have said. Let's start off with my biggest issue with the movie, the mood and tone of the movie just didn't sit right with the plot. The plot is considered creepy and weird, but the movie is a drama-comedy. Weird and drama-comedy don't mesh together very well, as presented in this movie. It's like trying to get 2 of the same poles on 2 magnets to attract to each other, IT DOESN'T WORK. I also didn't like a lot of Kevin Spacey's narration in this movie. It kind of spoils things that happens later in the movie, and I didn't like that. This isn't a con, but the scene where Ricky Fitts shows Lester's daughter the video of the flying bag was so unintentionally funny. The first time I watched the movie with my cousin, we laughed our asses off so hard. It was superbly unintentionally funny, I loved it. I'm glad that scene exists because it's so funny and memorable. Now, let's get into the pros of this movie. I'm really glad that this movie won best original screenplay at the academy, because the screenplay is really damn good. The information we need to know in this movie is presented so creatively, it blows my mind. If you watched the first Lessons On The Screenplay video on this movie, it goes over the creative methods used in the screenplay, and it is really nuts what Alan Ball did with this screenplay. The first dinner table scene in this movie is so memorable not just because it was intense, but because we learned just enough about these characters in a few exchanges of dialogue. The acting was phenomenal, especially Kevin Spacey's performance. I also like how the movie doesn't answer its questions that are brought up, because we the audience can have our own interpretation about what happens next. I think this is a really well made film. If the movie just got its tone and mood aligned with the plot, it could've been way better. 8/10",

            "content": "Career best performances from Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening. \"American Beauty\" is a comedy because we laugh at the absurdity of the hero's problems. And a tragedy because we can identify with his failure. The movie is about a man who fears growing older, losing the hope of true love and not being respected by those who know him best. The movie is the story of his rebellion. It's more about sadness and loneliness than about cruelty or inhumanity. Nobody is really bad in this movie, just shaped by society in such a way they can't be themselves, or feel joy. Thora Birch and Wes Bentley are the most grounded, talking in the tense, flat voices of kids who can't wait to escape their homes. Bening's character, a real estate agent who chants self-help mantras, confuses happiness with success--bad enough if you're successful, depressing if you're not. And Spacey, an actor who embodies intelligence in his eyes and voice, is the right choice for Lester Burnham. He does reckless and foolish things in this movie, but he doesn't deceive himself; he knows he's running wild--and chooses to, burning up the future years of an empty lifetime for a few flashes of freedom. He may have lost everything by the end of the film, but he's no longer a loser.",

            "content": "I found myself liking this movie right off the bat: the opening sequence, wherein the main protagonist Lester Burnham (portrayed by the ever-so-believable Kevin Spacey) uses self-deprecating irony to describe the incentive that'll eventually lead him into a fatal midlife crisis. From there on, \"American Beauty\" only kept me captivated throughout its full playback.\n\nFirstly, let me tackle the cinematography, as it's not enormously spectacular - although far above-average, if you ask me. Mendes & Hall did a great job at making nearly every shot one worth admiring (or, at least, appreciating): in light of this, one of the characters, namely one of Lester's neighbours, uses a consumer-grade 90s digital camera to film the activity around the protagonist's house in a fairly amateurish though certainly voyeuristic way, providing a unique point of view.\nThis furthermore describes the rest of the scenes and accompanying sound design: unique. Especially as Lester fantasises about one of his daughter's friends Angela, the scenes have a concise aesthetic vibe to them, albeit oftentimes coated in the film's eerie, dramatic self-awareness. The repeating of some compositions throughout the film to clarify the changes the characters have undergone, is a very nice touch to all of this, as well as the ending sequence making heavy use of gratuitous Hollywood-rainfall.\n\nMoving on to the story, I think it's clear by now that the movie gets the majority of its credit for exactly that. What comes to mind when trying to best describe the plot, are \"intricate\", \"existential\" and \"intriguingly thought-out\", all three with good reason: the Lolita-esque and thereby sexually open narrative paves the way for incredibly fine character construction, with Kevin Spacey once again performing like none other.\nThat is: Lester starts off as being a boring office worker, tired with life, far from daring to speak up for himself. Then, as he is both fired from his job and introduced to high schooler Angela, his character snaps in an almost tangible way, kicking off him cutting away all toxic aspects in his life whilst also working towards his ideal self, as to please an evenly idealised girl. Ironically, this includes getting rid of the white picket fenced American Dream, but in the end, after some well-placed twists, he manages to find himself, and thus his peace.\n\nI'm not going to lie: I didn't expect this movie to win me over at first, but I was happily surprised being proven wrong for two full - and I daresay exceptional - hours. Certainly, this film is a work of art possessing an intrinsic, intricate beauty - an American Beauty.",

But, after those first twenty minutes, I caught on and I enjoyed myself the rest of the way through.\n\nThe performances were great overall, but I found Chris Cooper to be the standout in terms of realism, and Kevin Spacey to be the standout when it came to what character I had the most fun watching. I realize how confusing that probably sounds, and I don't want to discredit the rest of the cast's excellent work (I shouldn't forget to mention Annette Bening and Wes Bentley), but I'll just briefly explain that while I thought Chris Cooper's character felt like a very real person, Kevin Spacey had such a charisma that every line of dialogue had me smiling.\n\nVisually, the film looks very much like every other late 90s dark comedy. The cinematography was good, but not especially unique. However, the famous rose pedal scenes and the use of frames within frames were incredibly eye-catching, and managed to still have substance with their style.\n\nI appreciated the stylized editing, but it did become tedious in a few moments for me. There were just a couple shots that were repeated too many times. The majority of the actual just moment to moment, cut to cut editing was great though.\n\nI can generally tell when a film will be better on my second viewing, and \"American Beauty\" felt like it would fall under than category. I really enjoyed it, and I imagine those first twenty minutes will be better now that I know what the overall tone is.",

While I can agree that Kevin Spacey did an amazing job in his role as Lester Burnham, I think this film is grossly overrated. It makes its social and moral commentary much to overt for my enjoyment.\n \nI also could not wrap my mind around the character Lester's arch. He goes from an average guy with a boring monotonous life to an anti-hero willing to engage in sexual activity with his daughter's best friend as well as blackmail his wife. It's not that this character arch was unbelievable, but more that it was unsatisfying. To me it was an attempt on the writer's part to make the film as edgy and biting as possible, while sacrificing the story line in the process.\n\nAnother point of discontent was the rose thread, which symbolized lust and passion. I felt it was too overt for the viewers. There is no element of this film that is difficult or trying to grasp; it is all very in your face, leaving nothing for the viewer to ponder as they leave the theater or walk away from the screen.\n \nI did appreciate the methods used in the film that contributed to the cinematography as a whole. The use of the mundane sounding elevator tunes throughout the movie conveyed the boring nature of the average American life beautifully and was a marvelous thread that stayed consistent up until Lester was shot. The sameness conveyed early in the film by the sets matching the characters' outfits was also a choice I appreciated that further exemplified the theme of monotony.\n \nAlthough some elements of the film did contribute to some enjoyable moments, overall I believe it was not as great a movie as others believe it to be due to overreaching on the writer's part to give it immense shock value, although it did convey an important social message in the end.",

Watching it again now, I still don't love it but I have a much greater appreciation of the artistry involved. The film looks stunning, and I think the writing is great. They do a good job of capturing what can happen when people become disillusioned with suburban life, and most of the relationships seem authentic. Kevin Spacey is great in the lead role, although his attraction to Mena Suvari needed more subtlety around his wife and daughter, because that felt exaggerated to an unrealistic level. Perhaps the biggest revelation watching it this time was Wes Bentley. His character is fascinating, and I love how complex the relationship was between him and his father. The movie is also a bit of a murder mystery, because Lester tells us in voice-over at the beginning that he is going to die. So we know, through the whole film, a murder is probably coming in the final act but they keep adding characters who might want to kill him. This kind of escalating mystery is something I greatly enjoy in movies. I have a slight emotional disconnect from the characters, so the movie doesn't affect me as strong as I would like. Also I feel the ending is a bit unsatisfying, almost as if they didn't know what to do after the main character was dead. But I appreciate the care that went into making American Beauty a quality film, and I recognize now why so many people love it.",

Those two things may sound a bit like oil and vinegar, but a beautiful screenplay blends them together enough so that the actors could take it and run with it. \n\nKevin Spacey and Annette Bening have arguably the strongest performances, with perfect comic timing that show us just how truly desperate these characters are. Oscar nods well deserved for both, but I have preference to Bening, as I can't help but imagine that a scene where she clings on to all of the clothes hanging in her closet and slowly falls to the ground was expertly improvised in an attempt to show raw human despair. \n\n5 stars from me.",

His transformation from an emasculated pathetic beta male to the ultimate alpha male was brilliant to watch.  Spacey is such a great actor that he brings a magnetism to every single role that he is in e.g Se7en and the Usual Suspects.  Stylistically the film is also brilliant.  The film is laden with visual metaphors, such as the use of rose petals to demonstrate Burnham's love for Angela.\n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/OkUWyg",

            "content": "This review will be short as this film is difficult to express in words. It truly mocks the audience at it's brilliance. Every shot and scene has a purpose, as if it were a Hitchcock film. Kevin Spacey's narration is superb. Every narration, as if it were an act closing in a play, creates ever longing suspense for the audience, resulting in a climatic ending for the cinematic history books. Every actor with a monologue has a quotable line that makes the viewer question his own existence and inescapable fate. The most memorable line being after Kevin Spacey's demise and narrating a beautiful monologue. He recalls his past and declares that his life flashed by in key moments. Whether it was laying in the grass and the touch of his grandmothers withered hand. Then when the audience just can't take anymore, he quotes our good friend Ricky Fitt's by saying, \"I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me... but it's hard to stay mad, when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much, my heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst... \" But then Kevin Spacey's character figures out the \"key of life\" and narrates it as beautifully as he can. \"And then I remember to relax, and stop trying to hold on to it, and then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life... You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure. But don't worry... you will someday.\" That's when I realized my own interpretation of the film, the only way to comprehend it is through death. As they say, \"You can never truly appreciate something until it's gone.\" Once you've lost something as precious as life, that's the only time you can truly appreciate the beauty of the world, and just let go. Perhaps relax and let it flow through you like rain, as said by our good friend Lester Burnham.",

            "content": "American Beauty is a film that appears complex but in reality is quite simple: It's a film that unabashedly tears apart the delusion of the american dream and the typical middle-class lifestyle. A genius film and a perfect closing-out for the '90s.\n\nThe brilliant part about American Beauty which proves that it's story is strong is that it does the classic progression method of multiple storylines diverging at the beginning before weaving back into one at the very end of the film. It's something that has been done many times over, but is completely brilliant to watch when written correctly, and it definitely is here.\n\nKevin Spacey and Annette Bening are the nucleus for most of the film, playing Lester and Carolyn Burnham, a unhappily married couple whose marriage has grown completely 100% stagnant and who are in desperate need of contact but refuse for the most part to give it to each other due to their overwhelming pent-up anger at one another which is the driving force of the film in many ways. Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is a sarcastic and melancholic high school student who is friends with the vain and self-important Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) who later becomes the object of Lester's desire. Jane meanwhile grows to befriend her next door neighbour and classmate Ricky Fitts, an equally different teenager who films everything he sees while dealing with an overbearing ex-marine father who is the very embodiment of conservative insecurity, and all these intersect at the grand finale where a preventable tragedy strikes at a bittersweet moment.\n\nAmerican Beauty is such a relatable film because many people have at least been close to relating with one, if not two of it's protagonists, whether it's the introversion of Jane, the cynical, yet desperate Lester, or any of the others who all have their own serious problems in the storyline. However, Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Lester is the driving point of the film, as everything ends up revolving around the character's fate. Spacey's portrayal of Lester paints the character as a fiercely smart person who decides to take action and bring back some freedom into his life after he has lived a torturously banal existence. It's a film that can come off as depressing, but give it the chance and you'll see that it's a true work of art, and again, a perfect closing film for one of the most manic decades of modern history. Plus, you'll discover several hilariously stuck-up and utterly conservative euphemisms for not being the complete master of one's domain.",

Of course, such things don't occur unless you're intolerant, self-centered, and stuck in a thankless job - but the movies have proven to me time and time again that, once you hit your late 30s, early 40s, things aren't as much \"I Love Lucy\" as they are \"Happiness.\" My immediate family has proven to me that a wife and kids can be a good thing so long as you work hard and treat everyone right, but stopping my probably-not-there concerns about the future isn't much of a possibility.\n\tMovies that further my anxieties follow the norm made by \"American Beauty,\" which wonders aloud if apparently having it all is as great of a thing as it's cracked up to be.  What if you do everything right in your life and still find yourself looking for a deeper meaning? An extraordinary (and extraordinarily funny) inside look at the pitfalls that dampen the cinematic trope of the mid-life crisis, it is a massively intelligent film that finds a dark humor in the trivial tragedies of suburban life.\n\tIt depicts the currently (and perhaps everlastingly) dejected life of an all-American family, a Nuclear one that surrounds their picture-perfect home with a white picket fence and a stunningly red coat of roses.  Pop, Lester (Kevin Spacey), is trapped in a boring job at an advertising agency; his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), is a struggling realtor with a winning smile and a bad habit of breaking down in soap operatic tears the minute something doesn't go her way; their daughter, Jane (Thora Birch), is so perpetually ignored that she's saving up for a boob job just so she can get attention from someone.  They all hate each other - but it wasn't always that way, and that makes \"American Beauty\" more heartbreaking that we would like to admit.  \n\tNone of their lives have much direction, so when Lester looks out into the world and catches a glimpse of Angela (Mena Suvari), Jane's best friend, at a cheerleading event, it's like a miracle: he finally has a purpose in his life, which is to impress, and maybe even seduce, the young, sexy blonde, though not realizing just how stupid, and creepy, that is.  \n\tAs he descends into an existence that seems to revolve only around \"looking good naked,\" Carolyn and Jane's problems simultaneously escalate.  Carolyn starts having an affair with her rival realtor (Peter Gallagher) and passes the time at the local gun range, and Jane decides to take up a relationship with the kid who just moved in next door (Wes Bentley), who obsessively films everything he sees, who is a pathological liar, and who is a drug dealer on the side.\n\tWe have a feeling that they all know that these hopes of validation will lead to nowhere, that their lives are a mess in the ways members of the suburbs can only understand, but it doesn't stop them from attempting to stop going through the motions and sin their way back to the top.  The film ends in a death, and we know this immediately as \"American Beauty\" starts - Spacey's narration comes from beyond the grave - but that isn't what drives the film.  What drives it is its relatability, and how true it feels when peering through the looking glass of the American Dream.  It's the American dream after the happy ending washes away and reality sets in.\n\tThe film is the directorial debut of Sam Mendes, who has gone on to make such classics as \"Road to Perdition\" and the latest two James Bond films.   \"American Beauty\" brings nuance and uncomfortably successful humor to a plot that we've seen many times before; it is the crown jewel of the mid-life-crisis movie, with Spacey (pathetic), Bening (piercing), Birch (scared), and Suvari (seductive) leading the way with indelible performances.  \n\tI still have no doubt that the 1970s, along with the '90s, are the best decades in cinema.  Most of their classics are small, character-based, talky, moving, original.  \"American Beauty,\" which arrived at the end of the era, is one of its most heartfelt.  We know its characters - we've passed them on the streets, we've made small talk with them.  Once we see life through their eyes for two hours, we understand them.",

Equal parts heart-wrenching, thought-provoking and surprisingly humorous, American Beauty is a beautifully written and sharply directed masterpiece. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Peter Gallagher and Mena Suvari all align to dish out a gorge of stellar performances. The film is a unique perspective into the life of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged white collar office worker who ditches his day to day life to chase a stunning high schooler. His sex life has all but disappeared, as his marriage becomes as bland as his life, and his daughter is distant and coarsely rude to him. A blend of sardonic humor, and a prompting, inspirational \"screw the status quo, do what you want\" theme, American Beauty is a poetic, satirical and incredibly inspirational motion picture, worthy of it's 5 academy awards and it's title as a classic of modern day cinema.",

Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a salesman of some kind who hates his life. He feels despised by his daughter and emasculated by his wife. But when a family moves in next door and Burnham meets the son played by Wes Bentley, he decides it is time for a change. and he goes through what some might call a mid life crisis and what others would call an awakening of sorts. \n\nThis movie is brilliant in every way imaginable. The acting, directing, writing, imagery, everything. all brilliant.  Kevin Spacey won a well deserved best actor oscar for his performance which reaches depths of insight and emotion that he can do so well. Wes Bentley is also good as the strange and abused son of a military man, played by a masterful Chris Cooper. Annette Benning is also great, and so are all of the supporting characters. Sam Mendes is still one of the best directors we have today in Hollywood and I think he is really underrated as a director. he always delivers good or great movies. and his directing and vision of life in this suburban neighborhood is amazing, thought provoking, disturbing, and beautiful. The script is very good as well. there are subtle little hints as to everything that will happen in the movie throughout, just hidden in the script. and all of the characters motivations are well thought out and logical. every character is fleshed out and you care about all of them in some way. you feel attached. you feel a part of the movie.\n\nThe movie is also hysterical. every line out of Kevin Spacey's mouth is comedic gold. it is infinitly quotable. American Beauty is the absolute definition of a brilliant mix of drama and comedy.\n\nIn conclusion, American Beauty is one of the best comedies ever made in my opinion. it deserved every oscar nomination and win it got. It is a flawless film and it is one of my favorites. \n\n10/10",

Tutto funziona alla perfezione, la colonna sonora essenziale, la sceneggiatura realistica e cruda, i personaggi interessanti e la regia delicata e a tratti amara di un grande regista che ha reso il film un'opera perfetta sotto ogni aspetto.

            "content": "*GREAT MOVIE*\n\n\"It's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world.\"\n\nThe definition of a dark comedy is a film that makes humor out of gloomy satire and serious situations. \"American Beauty\" is a dark comedy, yes, but it's not like any other one out there. A film like \"Fargo\" takes very serious subject matter that we are able to laugh at because of the behavior of the characters. \"American Beauty\" is different, there's a wall built between its comedic and dramatic elements, one the audience is easily aware of. \n\nIn \"American Beauty\", we laugh because we can relate, and because of the very strong sarcasm of the characters. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening were definitely the perfect choices for their characters. They're an unhappy married couple with a teenaged daughter, and it's only when Lester (Spacey) sees his daughter's beautiful friend at a basketball game, that he feels young again, and motivated to change from his usual, boring self. \n\nAt times, it's an uneasy film to watch, but it's always wonderful, even when it's a little uncomfortable. It sounds like this makes no sense at all, but it does, and you'll understand what I'm talking about if you've seen the film. Scenes in which Lester and Carolyn are arguing, are supposed to be funny because of their sarcasm, however, it's still understood as a serious scene. We aren't making fun of them, and we're not laughing down at them, we're making humor out of a serious situation, but it's understandable and obvious, and it doesn't diminish the scenes from their seriousness.\n\nThere are moments like that, and there are moments that are meant to be relaxed and serious. I was always intrigued at how, without thinking, the audience knows when a scene should be funny and when a scene is serious. This is done because of the outstanding performances from the whole cast and the wonderful script. \n\nThe story in \"American Beauty\" is layered, and the title works perfectly. Lester is intrigued by the beauty of his daughter's (Thora Birch) friend Angela (Mena Suvari). He is motivated for the first time in many years, and his descriptions of these feelings, and some wonderfully shot dream sequences, are excellent. The \"beauty\" he is referring to is merely physical beauty. The tagline of the film is \"look closer\", which suggests that outer beauty is NOT what the film is referring to. Or is it? In a way, I believe it's about both. \n\nJane is unhappy with her looks, and doesn't feel happy in her own skin, especially with her friend Angela who is always talking about how many times she has had sex. When a new neighbor moves in, she is both slightly creeped out and slightly curious when he begins filming her. Another fantastic scene is when Angela is in Jane's room, and begins dancing in the window when Ricky (Wes Bently), the new neighbor, is filming. He looks right past Angela and directly at Jane. This scene is the first time there is a focus on inner beauty. \n\nAll of the characters in the film find their own definition of \"American Beauty\". It's a wonderful depiction of an exaggerated family life in America. It's one of the few films with such a brilliant line between drama and comedy. It works as both wonderfully.",

He has always been very talented at displaying mental emotion, and in any of his roles I always feel that I can see what his character is feeling.\n\nAt times American beauty felt more comedic to me in the sense that the writer had blatantly thrown \"the truth\" at the viewers. This is how dysfunctional North American families really are, we all are a little crazy.\n\n\"America's Weirdest Home Videos\" is a statement anyone of us could make while peering into anothers life. But what about when they look back at us? \nHuman Behavior is fascinating and that's what made me like this movie more overall. I felt that was a very well portrayed theme here.\n\n7/10",

The other actors did a great job, as well, but Kevin Spacey just kind of steals the movie. The soundtrack is awesome. It makes the movie even more enjoyable. It's mostly the same kind of tune, but the way it's used in happy and in sad scenes just makes you get goosebumps. All in all, an amazing movie with great acting and a fantastic ending!

Also, I couldn't identify what the daughter's dilemma was, family issues, friend issues, relationship issues? I could not tell. And the daughters friend was very unlikable, I don't know if the character was written that way but she seemed like a rude person and weird because she was flirting with her friend's middle aged dad once she found out that he lusts after her. I don't like the daughter's boyfriend he is trying to seem deep and insightful but he is really just  coming off as a pretentious twat. I do like how he does deal drugs completely without his father knowing and he is pretty clever I will give the writers that. But the boyfriend just comes off as creepy with the filming of the neighbors and keeping the tapes. I just don't like this movie, its too pre-9-11 with its issues and for that it hasn't aged very well. I would skip it.",

American Beauty being the more hopeful movie about domestic situation's and life restrictions in regards to the boundaries we give ourselves.  Revolutionary Road would be the darker, far less hopeful film offering nothing but bleak outcomes to long term relationships.  Spacey lifts American Beauty as obviously the most memorable of any of the performances from either film delivering comedic levity to an otherwise depressed, broken in middle aged man desperately trying to find a upside to the suburban hell he constructed for himself.  There are elements of the movie i'm not overly found of such as its sub plot involving Wes Bently that only works in doses for me.  Not a total throwaway just my least favorite part of the movie.  In all, American Beauty offers far more than the average Hollywood films of the time with plenty of risky variables such as pedophilia involving Spacey's obsession with his daughters best friend played by Mena Suvari (remember her?) or the reveal of Chris Cooper's sexual tendencies as the overly aggressive military man father of Bently's character.

It speaks and continues speaking in a \nway that subtle little nuggets become things to behold long after you thought there was no wonder left to be had. \"American Beauty\" is a movie I tend to go to when \ntrying to judge people I have just met. Either they're \"American Beauty\" people, or they aren't, and its as simple as that. Often deemed overrated as a best picture \nwinner, which I believe it wholly earned, this film has seemed to settle in the dust among the younger generations. Like the classic album by the Grateful Dead the \nfilm borrows its title from, it may have never gotten the proper build up and follow through like the game changer it truly is. How something resonates with \nsomebody willing to accept such emotions is entirely dependent on the individual. This film has perhaps resonated with me greater than most movies with its \nsimplistic nuances, stimulating sensual imagery, and honest delivery... its reflections of truth clouded with misfortune but ultimately outshined by, for lack of a better word, beauty. Lester Burnham, played by Best Actor Winner Kevin Spacey in his best leading role, is the lynch-pin of this film with his quick wit, self-deprecation, and his to-a-fault leniency. He is stuck in a rut with his picture-perfect(only her intended projection) wife Carolyn(played by the fabulous Annette Bening)and his despondent, dark-eyed teen daughter Janie(Thora Birch). The movie cannot be sold on premise as much as substance. A dark, secretive neighbor boy becomes a friend of Lester and Janie respectively, Carolyn struggles as a realtor with needs unmet, and all of the internal struggles of what appear to be a simple suburban family unravel in a spectacular way. Different ideas, odd notions and segues please the senses as you become immersed in this piece of art. If you blaspheme it, I already have an idea of who you are. I am an \"American Beauty\" person.",

Kevin Spacey is actually mesmerising as Lester Burnham and brings such depth to a character who is first miserable and then ultimately freed. Chris Cooper is also rather fantastic and even the supporting characters shine. Mendes' direction is perfect. Its unique and ingenius.  One of the film's greatest qualities is actually adding a Lolita-style subplot, one that for many would be quite controversial,  yet not centering it. It shows that they are willing to suggest that there are darker things afoot. And that takes guts. I honestly, loved every minute of this film and found the ending to be unpredictable,  despite already roughly knowing it. Its story is utterly superb, because it begins so simply. Then converges into something far more interesting: a comical and grim take on peoples messed up lives. This film further succeeds because every character is severely flawed, yet all are very likeable. This film does something almost impossible to pull off. Its a very funny film.

The characters are a bit obvious of what their role is, and it may be something you seen before, but that doesn't mean that they can't be very memorable. The characters are very deep, and all of them were really well written. The themes in it were well thought out, and it's darkly funny. It's very interesting, and I wanted to see more of the characters of what they are going to do next. The acting is masterfully well done, and everybody seem to have a fun time in this. It may be too artsy for some people to think that it's trying to mean something, but I actually didn't mind the artsy stuff, it was really well done, and it wasn't actually the focus of it, it's the well thought-out characters. When it gets to the ending, it got me really sad and started thinking of my family. American Beauty is something that I didn't knew was going to be amazing, and it's one of the best movies I seen in a long time.",

It is a film that I could, and definitely would view over and over again for its themes and messages. \n\nWhat is 'American Beauty'? It's a film that won Best Picture in both the Academy and Golden Globes Awards shows. While this may seem like no more than a small honor, one must put in account how many people voted for Best Picture. A lot of people voted for Best Picture, and they picked American Beauty as the winner. A lot of people loved the film, me included. And it's understandable. The film is gold. Good to teach in film schools and for people who enjoy more than an endless action film. People who want a sophisticated indie film. \n\n'American Beauty' features beautiful cinematography and solid script work with sharp character writing. By the end of the film, I felt I could relate to each and every character in atleast one way. When the film reached its climax and started wrapping up its character's stories you were attached to the characters, felt as if you knew them. As if they were you. That's what solid scripting is. Great character development. An attribute that is misplaced often in film and it makes me cringe.  \n\nTo further my enjoyment of the film was a talented handful of well chosen actors including the likes of Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari, and Chris Cooper. All very talented actors, all fit for their respective roles. Spacey in particular exposes Lester Burnham's boredom with his life, and Bening showcases her character's stress and desires.  Bentley is fairly off putting (in a good way) as the creepy yet misunderstood next door neighbor. And finally Suvari showcases the beauty, particularly in Lester's fantasy sequences (Which were visually pleasant to the eyes). \n\nDirector, Sam Mendes perfectly captures the themes that 'American Beaut' presents. He uses colors to represent different symbols, like red in particular. \nThe color red drives Lester's story and the overall film itself. The red rose is the symbol for beauty and desire and love.  And Mendes b\\perfectly captures its meaning as well as many others on film. \n\nAll and All, 'American Beauty' is a beautiful film with an excellent script with well developed characters, solid themes of Conformity and Beauty, Imprisonment, and Redemption, and Sexuality and Repression.   It features awards worthy performances and beautiful cinematography and visuals. 'American Beauty' may very well be one of the best film's I've ever seen in my life. A 8/5/14\n\n 'American Beauty' is rated R for strong sexuality, language, violence, and drug use. It's appropriate for 16 (Depending on the child) and up. It's a pretty hard R, but parents should consider vetoing the rating and letting their older teenagers to see the film, as it supports very strong messages. \n\nI originally didn't plan on reviewing the film, after viewing it days ago, but the film stuck in my head for so long, that I felt I had to express my deep admiration for it on paper. You could call this review a love letter.",

I do not dislike the film because Lester is a \"pedophile;\" no, plenty of middle-aged men secretly or openly find high school girls attractive.  Besides, a pedophile by definition has an attraction to preteens.  I digress.  Anyway, this is a film far too pretentious for its own good, and hits you on the head with its message.",

Every character struggles with significant internal issues. None of them trusts anyone, communicate their troubles or reach out for help. There is no sense of love or goodness to offer hope or to root for. It is hard to relate or connect with such miserable and selfish individuals. There is no balance to identify with in this slowly unfolding train wreck. It is one thing to say everyone has problems, but this is too extreme.

The film takes us to the journey of characters in search of happiness, often unusual. 'American Beauty' is a drama with a touch of comedy.

Absolute nonsense. American Beauty could be the greatest American films ever made. It's up there, I feel, with Apocalypse Now, Jaws, Casablanca, On The Waterfront, and others. The more I thought about it after I watched the more I continued to admire it. It is a film of so many elements, so many subtexts, all of them so brilliantly done, that to say that the film is about one thing doesn't do service to how many layers are in this film. American Beauty is a film that defies any one explanation. On the surface it's about Lester Burnham deciding to change his life dramatically after becoming sexually obsessed with a teenage girl. Meanwhile his wife is desperately trying to sustain the facade of her perfect life, and his daughter's problems are basically ignored by the two of them. Below the surface it is a portrait of the darkside of American suburbia, ancriticism of the facades and lies that people construct around themselves, an attempt to find all the small beauties that exist in our world, and much more. The genius of this film is that's its able to weave all these elements, themes, and subtexts into a cohesive and satisfying story. It manages to hold all this together, while still being both very tragic, strangely uplifting, and darkly, darkly comic. Meanwhile every actor onscreen is completely brilliant. It is an exceptionally well-acted film, with every single character becoming unique human beings. American Beauty is one of those rare films where you don't see the A-list actors instead of the human characters onscreen. You begin to emphasize and fall in love with these characters, warts and all. Any flaw I can find with this film would be absolute nit-picking. The film is an absolute towering achievement that doesn't deserve any of the criticisms it has received. Truly a masterpiece, anyone and everyone who loves film should see American Beauty.",

A family moves in next door, a retired Maine Colonel Frank Fitts (Chris Cooper) his wife, Barbara (Allison Janney) and their teenage son, Ricky (Wes Bentley). Ricky smokes and sells weed.

For example the lighting in the film evoked a kind of somber beauty. I especially liked the scenes when Lester is fantasizing about Angela.\n      American Beauty is a modern day classic. One may even say masterpiece. Considering the fact it was Sam Mendes first film, the accomplishment is astonishing. The performances are brilliant. Bening and Spacey really stand out and deserved all the awards recognition they received. The younger actors are the glue that holds the piece together. Bentley, Birch, and Suvari all shine here. There is even some CGI used very subtly to enhance and forward the story.  I was struck by the true beauty of the cinematography. Mendes ability to frame his shots perfectly at every crucial moment is inspiring. This is a refreshing break from hollywood blockbusters.",

I'd probably really like American Beauty if it stuck to one side instead of having its message meander across the narrative like a disoriented octopus. Instead the film criticizes one lifestyle while also praising it. It expects us to take seriously these hyper-exaggerated caricatures that seem more like the creations of someone whose only knowledge of satire comes from the dictionary. There's a father who hates homosexuals and collects Nazi paraphernalia which fits the exaggerated image of what a homophobe would look like. This would be acceptable if that were the tone of the film, but the overall mood is a clash of serious and lighthearted mockery. Perhaps I am missing the point and simply don't get it.

The film takes us to the journey of characters in search of happiness, often unusual. 'American Beauty' is a drama with a touch of comedy. Brilliantly directed by Sam Mendes in his debut as a film director. The original and creative work of Alan Ball, who introduces us in this film. The cast, highlighting the performances of Oscar nominees Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey, and also the crew, who made a wonderful and great work in this film.

You really watch. There's a beautiful sense of ambiguity that the director admits to, but you're determined to find meaning in such a film - if only for yourself. Such a movie has hit several top lists; I finally see why. Of my own interest, I see this as a film that has most likely influenced Nip/Tuck. Perhaps most pleasing to me is the soundtrack - such a subtle detail makes or breaks films for me. Here on out is most likely filled with spoilers.\n\nOne of favorite things about this film is that it set us up to root for the Father. We know he's got a target, we know his death is going to occur at the very end. There's an endearing scene in which this character is talked down to, that he spills all his work papers. Not soon after, all of our sympathy is challenged when the switch is flipped, and his lust is reawakened by a cheerleader. One who is best friend's with his own daughter. From there on out, he speaks hatefully to those he encounters, he shamefully lusts after his daughter's best friend. And this breaks us. We see the Ice Queen Wife break down into tears - we see her humanity. And we see his daughter's insecurities as if reminders to our own high school hell. But the story is the Father's and we were first led to root for him. The father's later indifference to his wife's affair was perhaps my own turning point of giving up on him, of not rooting for him. But I'm not sure, even then, when he's going full force into an illicit affair of his own that I'm ready to root for his death. I'm only watching on, as the outside observer, wondering how. My next favorite thing about the film is that it manages to redeem the Father at the very end, as he wakes up again, as he dresses the young girl in a blanket and seems to have resolved his inner demons. \n\nWhat I hope to find in my rewatches is an understanding of how I then interpret the rest of the characters around the father's, now that I've stopped looking for the mystery and I can watch for the \"right\" clues.",

Throughout American Beauty, we see intricate layers of tension among several characters as well as a strangely sincere portrayal of airy sarcasm that is witty and clever enough to make this movie rewarding even if viewed simply for its comedy. While the characters and families often seem totally absurd, they are shockingly believable representations of some of the absurdity we see throughout much of society today.\n\nOften films and works of literature in general have a tendency to focus on a single character. We find one well developed personality with great depth surrounded by simple characters placed around the protagonist simply to aid the development of the protagonist. In American Beauty, Alan Ball has successfully created the illusion of entire very real families not only by creating several realistic characters, but by compounding interactions between all of them together in an elegant dancing network of personalities.\n\nThis interplay allows us to relate to every single character because we see where each of their personalities come from. It forces us to think of social ethics in a new light because we find that every individual is partly responsible for how the group constantly shapes all of the individuals within it. There is no simple answer for \"Who is to blame?\" What are we even blaming them for when there are so many factors that go into each individual's emotional state? By revealing the confusing nature of these questions, Alan Ball helps answer some difficult questions about society.\n\nNo other film I have seen has been so successful of accomplishing a personality interplay like this with so many characters at once, and this combined with its great comedy is why I award American Beauty with my rating of 5/5 stars that I reserve only for films that I consider to be the best of the best.",

At some of the most important times in their lives, we learn about the colorful personalities of these people. They all have beauty, something that pulls the audience in. We sympathize with them, we like to know about them. \n\nI'm most intrigued by the performance that Kevin Spacey gives. He's so believable, so perfectly sarcastic when he speaks during the humorous moments of the film, and so pathetic, but I like our protagonist. Come to think of it, every character has a likable aspect, but the things they hide from us, the things hidden underneath, can come out at any moment, and they're unexpected. \n\nNot only is \"American Beauty\" a brilliant dramatic picture that has us caring for the characters, it's also a successful comedy, and effortless at that. Naturally, some of these characters, especially Lester (Spacey) and Carolyn (Bening), are often sarcastic. It could seem awkward, it could be questionable, but it's not like that. I was never wondering whether or not a certain part was meant to be funny, it just is, and it works.\n\nIt's a comedy that is able to take itself seriously, and stay serious throughout its entirety. I've actually never seen a movie shift so quickly and easily from being incredibly dramatic and emotional to being a movie that seems to have some humor. \n\nHaving said all of this, I believe \"American Beauty\" is easily one of the greatest films about family, marriage, and especially beauty. The beauty and the beast. We see both here. We see lies, betrayal, depression, relationships, love, and friendship, appear, disappear, only to reappear. I loved it. The best film of the year.",
