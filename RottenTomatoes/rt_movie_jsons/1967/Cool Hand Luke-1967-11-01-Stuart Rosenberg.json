    "summary": "When petty criminal Luke Jackson (Paul Newman) is sentenced to two years in a Florida prison farm, he doesn't play by the rules of either the sadistic warden (Strother Martin) or the yard's resident heavy, Dragline (George Kennedy), who ends up admiring the new guy's unbreakable will. Luke's bravado, even in the face of repeated stints in the prison's dreaded solitary confinement cell, \"the box,\" make him a rebel hero to his fellow convicts and a thorn in the side of the prison officers.",

            "content": "An All Time Classic and one of the most unique films I've seen. The closest I can compare this too is Five Easy Pieces (1970) but without the anticlimactic ending. Where Five Easy Pieces is about having talent and not knowing what to do with it, this is more along the lines of refusing to conform, being a born rebel, and trying to find a place in a world that can't accept you. This also looks more outward rather than F.E.P. which looks more inward. This is also better paced and never meanders. It's a slow burn that slowly reveals what its about. Every fundamental piece of this is pretty much flawless. This is definitely a challenging watch and encapsules the spirit of the late 60's and New Hollywood. Without a doubt though, Paul Newman is what sends this over the top. With very little dialogue he draws you in with his charisma, charm, and smile. George Kennedy also does incredible as well. Everyone should give this a watch. While I can't say every person will love this, it will definitely leave an impression on you and that says something.",

Was it fair that our protagonist ends up with a bullet in the head? No.  Did he bring it on himself?  Unquestionably, yes.",

That day they scared \"the man\" and made their spirits soar.\nAnd then there was the time Luke decided that he could eat 50 eggs in an hour.\n\nCool Hand Luke was a hero, not an anti-hero. He never hurt a soul. (Although he did get drunk and cut the heads off some parking meters, and that got him put on the chain gang.)\nThe man hated Luke not for what he did, but because they couldn't break him.

After seeing it a few more times as I got older, I am absolutely riveted by it, I appreciate it so much more and I have come to adore this film. Paul Newman is amazing here, he IS Luke, he hides perfectly behind the character that he plays and he does such a damn good job at it. He is a drunkard who doesn't have much going for him and as you explore his past and his personality, you really get invested in his character, you get said with him, and you cheer for him when something goes right. He is so charming and suave, yet laid-back and chill about what happens to him, we see a great range of emotions throughout this film and every one of them is amazing. I loved his spirit and his boldness, he stands up for what he believes to be right, and we can't help but agree with everything that comes out of his mouth, even though he committed a crime and went there to be reformed, it really speaks for how well he pulled it off, he definitely deserved on Oscar for his performance, he was snubbed. George Kennedy, who did win an Oscar, was great too, he his the perfect other half to Luke, he was a jokester who liked to gamble, but he had been in prison for a while already so he brought the nice veteran presence with experience, and you really do believe that he knows all of the ins and outs and exactly how he should behave, I found him to be relevant to the plot, realistic, likable, and a well explored character. The portrayel of the prison life is amazing considering that this was made in 1967, they found great ways to make there character have interesting conversations and participate in engaging activities that contribute to the plot. I found the death of Luke at the end to be the perfect finish to his character, it felt earned and the best way possible to show how Luke grew and developed as a character throughout the film, it is very fitting, yet still very emotional and makes me cry. The new years eve egg-eating scene is so unique and memorable, it is fun and exciting to watch, and you can feel his pain as well, he is so strong and dedicated, it is actually inspiring. The main theme for this movie makes me tear up, it represents Luke perfectly and makes me remember that old Luke smile every time, it is wonderful and sounds great. The only minor issue I have with this film is the car washing scene was a little too gratuitous, it made sense in real life, but it really didn't need to be in the movie, but it's not bad. This movie reached emotional heights within me that have made me constantly go back and rewatch this masterpiece. I implore anyone and everyone to see this movie, I think that this is better than the Shawshank Redemption and I love that movie. With one of the best scripts ever written, the impeccable acting, the charming characters, the enjoyable plot, the entertaining jokes, great emotional sequences that feel earned, and one of the best original themes composed, this is a must-see classic.",

            "content": "A grueling depiction of prison dehumanization.\n\nCool Hand Luke (1967) is Stuart Rosenberg's starling prison drama that goes to great lengths to demonstrate how the prison industrial complex breaks the spirit of its inmates. From the assignment of numbers to prisoners giving nicknames instead of their formal names. The brutal beatings, exhausting forced work, punishment chambers, verbal abuse, and general confinement all lead Cool Hand Luke into a vicious and harrowing experience of what it is like in a manual labor prison.\n\nRosenberg's direction is fascinating as he focuses in on character's anguished faces, sweat dripping bodies, languid movements, broken pride, and tired eyes. Rosenberg's direction is an accomplishment of dissecting the human condition and our natural desire for freedom. Cool Hand Luke mirrors our humanity and cruelty back at us in a starkly realistic picture.\n\nDonn Pearce's novel and script heavily critiques authority and masculinity. Cool Hand Luke spits in the face of prison guards, wardens, and enforcers as bullies bent on projecting their insecure masculinity onto their victims. The prisoners themselves face the challenge of presenting their own masculinity to their fellow inmates in a display of dominance. They basically have to show how tough or strong they are in boxing, gambling, or talking before they earn the respect of the other inmates. Cool Hand Luke wins them over by thriving in all three categories, while finding ruin for himself due to his own quiet rebellion. He is punished for his overt masculinity and explicit disrespect to his captors. Cool Hand Luke forces men to look at how dangerous being the man with all the machismo is for your physical and mental health, while condemning the guards for their abuse of power. It's a clever dynamic at play in Cool Hand Luke. \n\nLalo Schifrin's score is mesmerizing and delightful little melodies played in the style of country, bluegrass, and folk music with a contemporary twists. The music being so playful and uplifting contrasts the horrors of the jail experience in a profoundly upsetting way. The scene in which Paul Newman plays his banjo is very uniquely disturbing and sad.\n\nSpeaking of which, Paul Newman is outstanding and endearing as Cool Hand Luke. His sure and calm manner make for a nice foil for every other character in the film. Newman's gentle voice, hypnotizing eyes, and thoughtful grace display a more mature archetype for the masculine man. He is the opposite of George Kennedy's boisterous fool.\n\nFurthermore, George Kennedy's Dragline character is hilarious and good humored, while keeping you transfixed by his strange performance. He character is loud, obnoxious, and fun. He is the prototypical male stereotype who butts heads with Luke for his own satisfaction. Once he gets to know Luke as a smart, cool, and resilient man, he respects him. It's a neat dynamic between these two characters.\n\nThe rest of the cast is interesting in how ordinary they feel. Harry Dean Stanton is kindly and meek, while Dennis Hopper is crazy and random. J.D. Cannon is confident and observant. The other prisoners are relatively regular guys and this makes Cool Hand Luke feel so lifelike.\n\nJo Van Fleet has a gripping cameo as Luke's dying and disappointed mother. She feels more grisly than the inmates. Joy Harmon gives an unforgettable car wash.\n\nOf the guards, a few standout performances make Cool Hand Luke chilling. Strother Martin is commanding and fierce as Captain. Luke Askew is horrifying and revolting as Boss Paul Hunnicut.\n\nOverall, Cool Hand Luke persists as a stellar social commentary piece on prisons and an excellent example of thoughtful filmmaking. Paul Newman's performance alone is worth watching for honestly.",

            "content": "âCool Hand Lukeâ? released in 1967 follows a man who is sentences to prison but chooses not to follow the rules. The film made me think a lot about those who are in the prison system. In the beginning of the film, it was indicated that Luke, who was only serving two years would be working alongside people who had done treacherous things and were serving 20 plus years. To me, the film separates itself from those in its genre as Luke proves to be a good guy overall. There isnâ(TM)t anything that I wish they did differently. In terms of the writing, I loved the scene when Luke does the egg eating contest. Itâ(TM)s comical at how intrigued everyone is by it. It just goes to show how the guys in prison come to appreciate the little things in life as a result of their isolation. One of my favorite shots in the film is when the floor walker gives the prison rules to the men, the shot of him is with the camera down below him, looking up at him. This shot gives the character power and authority by having him tower over the other characters. A scene that I enjoyed regarding the editing was when Luke is sawing a hole in the floor of the bunk that they stay in. the shots cut between him sawing, people are around him dancing and having a great time, and then it cuts to the floor walker ringing the bell, almost catching him. Instead, Luke is able to hide the hole just in time. This series is a great example of adding tension. Paul Newman is tremendous as Luke, and he showcases such an incredible range in the film. Heâ(TM)s charming and endearing, he sings and plays an instrument, he has moments of joy and despair. It is easy to see why heâ(TM)s had such a successful career and so many people love him as an actor. Regarding the cinematography, I felt that the shot when the prisoners wake up to start work was so beautiful. The sky is bright, almost white, and thereâ(TM)s an orange/pink glow coming from the lights in the cabins. It gives a beauty to a terrible circumstance for the men. A scene that I appreciated for the sound design was when Luke gets beaten up. The punching noises sound so painful and certainly warrant the reactions from the guys watching the fight.",

Luke Jackson (Paul Newman) is sentenced to a stretch on a southern chain gang after he's arrested for drunkenly decapitating parking meters. While the avowed ambition of the captain (Strother Martin) is for each prisoner to \"get their mind right,\" it soon becomes obvious that Luke is not about to kowtow to anybody. When challenged to a fistfight by fellow inmate Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke simply refuses to give up, even though he's brutally beaten. Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. Finally, when Luke finds out his mother has died, he plots his escape; when he's caught, he simply escapes again. Soon, Luke becomes a symbol of hope and resilience to the other men in the prison camp -- and a symbol of rebelliousness that must be stamped out to the guards and the captain. Along with stellar performances by Newman, Kennedy, and Martin, Cool Hand Luke features a superb supporting cast, including Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, and Joe Don Baker as members of the chain gang.",

A prison that sends its inmates on hard working chain gangs and keeps the inmates locked up in a communal dormitory.\nThe petty criminal is sentenced to two years and soon earns the nickname Cool Hand Luke because he's called Luke, he is very cool and is good at cards! Luke also wins over the other prisoners for his bravery, bravado (winning large bets by eating 50 eggs in an hour!) and having the sheer audacity to say no to the system by making repeat escape attempts.\nEach time he escapes he is eventually captured and on return to the prison he faces ever tougher sanctions be it iron fetters, confinement in some solitary box and being mentally broken by the guards by being given back breaking impossible tasks to complete. \nHis final escape attempt is a tragedy.\nA great film that despite its age shows that old fashioned life skills such as perseverance pays.

Cool Hand Luke is the story of a man who is sent to a rural prison and decides that he will not let that life break him.  Paul Newman is great as Luke, his charm is so evident that you can see why he wins over all the people around him, and it makes the last act of the film that much more surprising.  All the prisoners are interesting characters, but many of them kind of fade into the crowd and I wasn't able to differentiate specific personality traits that set them apart.  But the one guy who stood out was the late-great George Kennedy.  He is the perfect actor for that role, and his fight with Luke is a great scene which causes a logical shift in his performance.  Perhaps the most engaging part of this film is the arc we see the prison guards go through.  Early on I saw them as very reasonable people, but as the film progresses you sympathize much more with the prisoners and start to see the oppression of their captors.  All around I think Cool Hand Luke is an excellent film, but it is tough to take the bleakness at times.  There's one particular scene that is heartbreaking which almost brought me to tears.    But to be honest, the biggest difficulty I had with the movie was the ending, so SPOILER ALERT:\n\nIn many ways this film felt like the anti-Shawshank Redemption.  Part of the joy of watching that film is that it puts Andy in a similarly depressing situation but he finds his happy ending.  In Cool Hand Luke the ending is so sad that I just can't imagine myself wanting to revisit the film.  It's well-made but I can't rate it as highly because there's another movie which is so similar that I like more, even though this one came out first.",

            "content": "Luke doesn't think of himself as a legend.  Sure, he's a decorated Korean War vet, and sure, he has good enough looks to inspire widespread questions of stardom.  But he ain't perfect.  So imperfect is Luke, in fact, that something as stupid as cutting heads off parking meters during a drunken stupor lands him in a chain gang, despite a solid reputation and round-the-clock likability.  When arrested, he doesn't put up a fuss.  To hell with societal expectations.  \n\tWhen he unceremoniously arrives on the grounds of the prison, he is instantaneously targeted by his personality searching counterparts.  He's a picturesque panther in a crowd of wild hogs.  They torment him, mocking his every word, attempting to find a demeaning nickname that suits his sardonic face - but he won't have it.  Luke is a man of integrity, of bravery; his ability to withstand dire conditions makes it easy for his peers to eventually idolize him.  All it takes is a losing fight where he just won't back down, and a willingness to devour fifty eggs for the sake of proving a point that doesn't really matter in the first place.  He does all this with a smiling face, somehow ignoring the brutality of the guards and the fact that he is, you know, spending the next two years in prison.\n\tIf you were to only watch the first half or so of \"Cool Hand Luke\", you might look at the titular protagonist in the same way you did Harry Callahan and Frank Bullitt, an anti-hero worth bragging about to your friends because you knew him, because he was cooler than you ever were, because he was a crazy S.O.B. that didn't have much of a problem with questioning the MAN.   But the film is a multifaceted account of an idol, a layered portrait of someone who seems flawless in the context of one's soul searching thoughts, but, in truth, is just as much a mess as the fellow messes of the 1960s and beyond.  Perhaps the men of \"Cool Hand Luke\" will always see Luke as that guy who knew what justice was, the guy who didn't let the beating sun damage his seemingly uncrushable spirits - but the movie is just gutting enough to remind us that, beneath their slick dexterity, maybe John McClane was hot shit because he had to survive, not because he was trying to be hot shit.  Maybe Philip Marlowe looked danger straight in the eyes while also fearing for his life.  \n\t\"Cool Hand Luke\" doesn't see its anti-hero through lazy rose-colored glasses; it doesn't want us to see him that way.  It is a prison movie too optimistic for its circumstances, one that just so happens to have a movie star leading the array of buffoons.  And once the film suddenly and quickly takes a turn down kitchen-sink-realism lane, we realize that \"Cool Hand Luke\" was never optimistic to begin with; it only seemed that way because its world was seen through the eyes of the prisoners that placed Luke on a pedestal for so long.  When Luke unexpectedly jumps off his pedestal and becomes a man who can't take the beatings of the guards any longer, our smiles are, without warning, slapped right off our faces.\n\tPaul Newman could have become the next Clark Gable/Cary Grant/John Wayne, a pretty boy with enough of a rugged exterior to pass himself as a movie hero, but the '60s changed any preconceived notions one might have had.  (Not that there were many, considering his star-making turns in 1950s fireballs \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" and \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\".)  He sprinted from one anti-hero role to the next, evidenced by \"The Hustler\", \"Hud\", and \"Harper\", all unseen by be (besides \"Harper\", which I enjoyed many moons ago and can hardly remember).  \"Cool Hand Luke\" is said to be his peak, his most famous moment of the '60s.  It's hard to disagree: Newman doesn't just provide us with one of the most investing cinematic characters of all time; he also gives a tremendously heartfelt performance, tricking us into thinking that he's an assured societal diamond accidentally in the roughest place in the state when, in actuality, he's a lost soul in search of existential meaning after finishing his prime years.  We become convinced that his drunken mind must have told him to steal the coins of parking meters because he simply had nothing better to do besides become someone else's God.\n\tStuart Rosenberg's direction is arguably too cinematically voluptuous for its own good, making the life of a chain gang member seem sweeping and summery, like something out of a Loretta Lynn scented country song.  But maybe we only see the beauty, the characters finding themselves in an atmosphere emotionally similar to that of \"Papillon\".  But the screenplay, penned by Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson, is stunningly moving, upstaging Rosenberg's many intriguing directorial choices.  They find a commonplace between pity and empathy for the prisoners who spend their days doing nothing except idolize Luke.  They don't make them pathetic; we somehow understand that they probably never had a father to look up to and never had anything to discuss at home besides a female that glanced at them once or a cathartic bar fight they participated in a few days back.  \n\tMost notably is Dragline, portrayed by George Kennedy, who goes from active chain gang bully to Luke worshipper.  His fascination does not come from a homoerotic place; it, instead, is an unexpected twist in a life that has been cruel to him.  Finally, he has a friendship with someone that doesn't fear his toughness and doesn't write him off as a not so gentle giant.  Luke doesn't quite feel the same way, but we have an affection for Dragline.  He is so blinded by his new emotions of adoration that, even when Luke shows signs of human struggle, he can hardly ignore the charade that plays out over and over again in his mind.  Long after Luke leaves his life, he will still be telling new meat, and, later on, family members and bar patrons, the stories of Luke and what he meant to him, while they nod along politely, never quite understanding why the protagonist of his story was such a supposedly incredible guy.  Kennedy, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, is unquestionably terrific.\n\tBut \"Cool Hand Luke\" is Paul Newman's movie, and is, on a broader scope, the movie that flipped the anti-hero cliché onto its back and reminded us that, hey, anti-heroes have feelings too.  The film is as level-headed as it is romanticized.  We see life from the eyes of Dragline and Luke himself, as it just comes to show that a cinematic world isn't as much of an escape as we normally expect it to be.",

But he's not perfect. Things happen that bring his character down to earth. You think the character is being glorified, but then you find out he really doesn't have a grand plan, and he's just doing what he has to do when the time is right. You just can't help to respect him. People like Sylvester Stallone are parodies of Paul Newman.\n\nWhen I first watched the movie the only scene that I didn't like was the freak out scene when he was digging the ditch. Because you didn't really know what he was up to up to that point and he stayed so cool, and the digging scene was so rushed I was disappointed that he wasn't faking the freak out. They really broke him. Then after him and Dragline made their escape and Dragline was saying he knew Luke had a plan, and you could tell Luke was a hero to him, and Dragline even makes the same complaint about the freak out scene that I just made, but then Luke just casually says he had no plan and he's not the criminal mastermind that Dragline thinks he is. That's the scene where the ego of the film is deflated and the Paul Newman persona was born. Much like Clint Eastwood, but still uniquely his. I still think the ditch digging scene was a little rushed, but it's totally forgiven.",

            "content": "Paul Newman stars in an anti-establishment drama, and, quite frankly, does it get anymore late 1960s than that? Sometimes you have to listen to the establishment, because even though ol' Luke is too cool for school, he's too pretty for prison, so stay in school, kids. Actually, Luke seems to think that he's too cool for the system, because even after they caught Butch Cassidy, he was still refusing to do what the man told him to. I guess that's to be expected from Paul Newman, but I think that he might just be here to vouch for screenwriters Donn Pearce and Frank Pierson in case people accuse them of ripping off \"Hombre\". Newman is just too cool for words, and I mean that literally, because between \"Hombre\" and this film, he probably just barely accumulated the amount of dialogue a lead role has in a regular film in 1967. Maybe it's a good thing that he's so quiet, because it lead to us getting the line, \"What we have here is a failure to communicate\" (I love Guns N' Roses' \"Civil War\"), although, as much as the titular lead breaks the rules, that line was probably going to get here somewhere along the way. No matter what Newman does, it seems to always lead to a pretty good movie in this case, and yet, he isn't too cool to set this film above its problems.\r\n\r\nThe antics of the titular Luke Jackson and peers are fun and all, but in all of its working so hard to supplement your understanding of the characters and their dynamics within and amongst themselves, the film hits a few set pieces that are hard to believe, but arguably needed, seeing as how not much else is there to supplement the characterization. Developmental shortcomings prove to be a big issue in this film, for immediate background is lacking, and gradual exposition is surprisingly superficial, to where one ought to, in fact, find a failure to communicate, that is, the depths of the roles which are hard to get especially invested in. Still, no matter how much the film saves time by cutting back on exposition, it still clocks in at a little over two hours, and doesn't get their easily, on the back of filler, perhaps even some material excesses which lead to a sense of narrative aimlessness. If nothing else projects some sense of limpness, it's Stuart Rosenberg's directorial cold spells, which are limited in this generally either entertaining or engrossing drama, but still stand to sometimes all but bore and consistently bland in their defusing an even conceptually thin sense of momentum. Honestly, this film doesn't seem to be as edgy as it could have been, and that most holds the effectiveness back, through a lighthearted attitude that is punctuated by thin conflicts, further thinned out by all of the missteps in believability, development and pacing. What the film does right it does so very right, thus, the final product rewards, but not as easily as many say, for there's not much to say, and the storytelling says it rather limply at times. Still, on the whole, the final product rewards as some degree of the entertaining, when not biting drama it holds the potential of being.\r\n\r\nI just got done criticizing Donn Pearce's story concept for taking potentially edgy subject matter as a generally realist study on prison life, and interpreting it into something a little light, but there's still something genuinely refreshing about this film, as well as promising, with dramatic intrigue, and a hint of colorful fluff. There is plenty of potential for entertainment value, and even Stuart Rosenberg does it a degree of justice, with a directorial performance whose steadiness is often bland, but rarely too much so, for their is enough subtle flare to Rosenberg's style to liven things up, and enough realization to the thoughtfulness to resonate about as much as he can with material so thin. Rosenberg feels confident in his storytelling more often than not, and that's endearing, especially when Rosenberg's efforts prove truly effective by their own right, in breathing life into an intriguing story concept and, for that matter, a solid script. Pearce and Frank Pierson get to be misguided in their both narrative overblown and developmental thin scripting, but their efforts remain memorably effective on the whole, with dialogue being razor-sharp, and set pieces being colorful in their keeping pacing up, at least more so than actual progression. Also commendable is Pearce's and Pierson's extensiveness, which is limited by natural shortcomings of the time and the story concept, and by the storytelling missteps, but realized enough for you to gain a firm grip on themes regarding the chemistry and questionable treatment of prisoners, and to find memorable roles through all of the characterization issues. This film needs for you to get invested in its characters in order to thrive, and that's where the performances come in, because just about everyone has a time to shine, whether it be Jo Van Fleet in a show-stealing cameo, or Morgan Woodward as a chilling antagonist, or George Kennedy in a delightfully charming, Oscar-winning performance, or leading man Paul Newman, who carries the film in his doing way more than the writers in capturing the iconically smooth charisma of the titular Luke Jackson character, punctuated by unexpected and powerful dramatic layers which humanize the leads as an effective audience avatar and protagonist by his own right. One can understand why the film is so iconic, for so many aspects to it are memorable in their being so effective, maybe not to where the flaws can be completely forgiven, but certainly to where the film compels, entertains and ultimately rewards.\r\n\r\nOnce the time is done, some lapses in believability, many lapses in expository depth, and frequent lapses in focus, under the weight of dragging, cold spells and, on top of all of that, natural shortcomings threaten the final product, but on the backs of intriguing subject matter, confident direction, sharp writing and powerful performances, \"Cool Hand Luke\" rises as an ultimately rewarding portrait on prison life in all of its color and grime.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\n\n\"What we've got here is failure to communicate.\"\n\nIf there's one genre that generally impresses me, it's the prison escape film. I don't know why, something about the way the characters are handled in their situations leaves a lasting mark on me with each film. Which is why I loved films like I Am a Prisoner from a Chain Gang, The Great Escape, and O Brother, Where Art Thou. Cool Hand Luke is something I had wanted to watch for quite a while, due to the massive influence it's had over the years, even making reference in films like Toy Story 3 (\"take him to the box\"). And while I didn't enjoy Cool Hand Luke as much as I wanted to, I still found the film to be decently entertaining at best.\n\nLuke  Jackson (Paul Newman) is sent to a chain gang in the Deep South after decapitating parking meters while intoxicated. Despite the captain's (Strother Martin) ambitions to \"get their mind right\", Luke gets his title \"cool hand\" due to his smarts in the system. But after a while, Luke's tired of conforming to his new life, so he plots to make a massive escape, becoming the symbol of hope and rebellion in the chain gang.\n\nThe problem with Cool Hand Luke is that director Stuart Rosenburg has serious pacing issues with the film. Some of the situations Luke faces in the camp is just extreme filler just to get Luke wanting to bust out, and it really bothers me. While the film becomes extremely enjoyable once Luke plots his escape, the hour and a half it takes leading up to it's a little bit of torture to watch. I didn't particularly enjoy Luke's \"cool hand\" poker game nor his conversation with his mother that had little to nothing to do with the actual plot.\n\nAlso the supporting characters are not interesting either. I wanted to like Luke's buddy inmate Dragline, played by George Kennedy, who won an Oscar for this role, but his character's so boring that I couldn't root for him to high, even if Kennedy did an alright job in his role. \n\nBut there's three things that made me enjoy Cool Hand Luke for what it was. First, Strother Martin does a fantastic job playing the captain. Every single line of dialogue he says is so entertainingly brilliant that I wanted him to have more screen time than what he ended up getting. At least he says the best line of dialogue in the whole movie (that famous \"failure to communicate\" line).\n\nSecond, the score by Lalo Schifrin (of Mission: Impossible fame) is AWESOME!!! It's unique, it's delightfully catchy, and it leaves a lasting impact, which is what scores are supposed to do.\n\nAnd finally, the real reason why I thought Cool Hand Luke was still a good movie was Paul Newman's performance as Luke. Considering that the plot seemed episodic at times in Luke's experience in the chain gang, Newman completely nails what Luke is going through. When Luke goes Man v. Food and eats fifty eggs, I knew Luke was going to be a very relatable character than many can root for. And that's what Newman does. While you want to know more about Luke's past, Newman graces the screen so well that you don't really care so much. Roger Ebert says it best. It's Newman's smile that makes his performance work so well. Can't explain it more. You'll have to watch it to know what I mean.\n\nIt's not the greatest movie in the world, as the pacing is a chore to get through at times, and the supporting characters aren't that interesting, but Cool Hand Luke still remains an entertaining prison escape flick, with Paul Newman's Oscar-nominated performance making up for my negatives on the film. At any rate, this manages to hold up better than the extremely overrated Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, also starring Newman.\n\n\"No man can eat fifty eggs.\"",

He captures the admiration of the inmates becoming their defacto leader, and even earning respect among the guards. Paul Newman's character might not give a damn about anything, but he won't give up or in to anything either. Toss in camera work that goes from intensely intimate to sweeping and epic as they tar a road and a stellar, deep supporting cast and this-for me-is as good as cinema will ever get. Strother Martin may have been type cast from this piece of art, but come on! His stammering, innocent sounding by remorselessly cruel camp warden he created was brilliant! \"Wha-what we have here...is...a failure...to communicate!\" Yes, brilliant dialogue, but just as brilliantly delivered by all concerned!

Sure, there are some tension relieving moments and even some witty banter in the dialogue, but the film is not a comedy. \nAccording to Merriam-Webster a Comedy is\n\n1\na : a medieval narrative that ends happily \nb : a literary work written in a comic style or treating a comic theme\n2\na : a drama of light and amusing character and typically with a happy ending\nb : the genre of dramatic literature dealing with the comic or with the serious in a light or satirical manner - compare tragedy\n3\n: a ludicrous or farcical event or series of events \n4\na : the comic element \nb : humorous entertainment \n\n\"Cool Hand Luke\" matches exactly zero of these definitions, unless ones sense of humor is strikingly similar to that of the Marquis de Sade. Do the people at Rotten Tomatoes ask, \"what was your favorite part, where his mother died or when they pushed him to physical exhaustion?\" Please note, I am not saying \"Cool Hand Luke\" is not a good film. It's exceptionally well made and everyone delvers a grade A performance. It's just not a comedy.\nThank you, \nthat is all.",

            "content": "Film that more or less redefined the prison movie genre but also began the reinvigoration of the idea of rebel as metaphor. Here Newman is very good as the supposed 'rebel without a cause'. He's charming and likeable despite being a petty criminal, and he plays by his own rules as you'd expect, even when it's to his detriment; in fact *especially* when it's to his detriment. But he's not that one-dimensional, at the characters core of apparent cynicism is a lost sadness that Newman effectively conveys. George Kennedy is the real stand-out as the 'top dog' inmate who for once isn't a big bully but more of a paternal figure, who takes a shine to Luke when he sees he's a man who refuses to be broken. In this film, it's the characters that shine.\n\nBut then, we have the problem of such a weighty metaphor as the rebel and his role in society and I don't think the director knows what to do with it. This film contains many memorable set pieces, but also a lot of well... 'filler' that do it a grave injustice. The result is it just isn't as good as it could be, and some of the symbolism is a little heavy-handed. The ending was predictable, as well. In the end though, it's a good story and you'll be better-off for having got to know Cool Hand Luke.",

            "content": "One problem with society is its tendency to marginalize those who are different or don't fit in and, to a degree, this is what COOL HAND LUKE is about. Luke is a loner who is picked up by the cops one evening for cutting the heads off parking meters while drunk. However inconsequential this crime might seem, it gets him two years on a chain gang and what transpires over the next couple of hours shows how one man resists a system which seemingly has no place (or use) for him. Despite the overall downbeat tone, the film still manages to have a sense of humor which is heavily derived from situations that one might find while in prison. It also helps that Paul Newman as Luke is so likeable and \"cool.\" The title of the film comes from a scene in which Luke is playing poker with the other guys and wins by bluffing the other guy into folding. He says that \"Sometimes nothing is a cool hand,\" and from then on is called \"Cool Hand Luke.\" Aside from Paul Newman's excellent performance, Strother Martin gives a great turn as the prison captain who, while seemingly easygoing on the surface, is quite authoritarian and does everything in his power to beat Luke into submission. He also gets an awesome quote which has become quite famous: \"What we've got here is a failure to communicate.\" Not only is that a great line, but the way in which he delivers it suggests a weariness with the way that Luke has thus far managed to resist being broken. It was also nice to see Harry Dean Stanton, Ralph Waite and Dennis Hopper in supporting roles. Lastly, the cinematography and score by Lalo Schifrin were also excellent. My favorite element was a repeated closeup of a guard's sunglasses which showed the reflection of what he was looking at, and in general, the on-location shooting gave a very palpable sense of what the characters were feeling whether it was the scorching sun or pouring rain. Overall, this is an outstanding entry in that latter days of Hollywood's golden age which has been extremely influential on the films that have come after it. Whether you feel like you fit in or not, COOL HAND LUKE tells a great story with fine performances from its cast.",

When challenged to a fistfight by fellow inmate Dragline (George Kennedy), Luke simply refuses to give up, even though he's brutally beaten. Luke knows how to win at poker, even with bad cards, by using his smarts and playing it cool. Luke also figures out a way for the men to get their work done in half the usual time, giving them the afternoon off. Finally, when Luke finds out his mother has died, he plots his escape; when he's caught, he simply escapes again. Soon, Luke becomes a symbol of hope and resilience to the other men in the prison camp -- and a symbol of rebelliousness that must be stamped out to the guards and the captain.",

Detweiler, is forced to spend a whole ten minutes of his recess in the box.  Referencing, of course, the first night in the prison camp, this episode of Recess shows the lasting impact that Cool Hand Luke had on the collective memory of society.  With an Oscar nomination for Paul Newman, and a win for Best Supporting Actor for George Kennedy, Cool Hand Luke is one of those movies that gets constantly referred to in other pop culture.  Still listed as 100% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes 46 years after its release, Cool Hand Luke is highly regarded as a classic film in every sense of the word.  \nA decorated war hero with a history of insubordination, Lucas \"Luke\" Jackson (Paul Newman) gets 2 years of hard labor in a Florida prison camp for drunkenly cutting the tops off of parking meters.  He makes a quick enemy out of Dragline (George Kennedy), and after a boxing match in which Luke refuses to give up, they become fast friends, and Luke begins to emerge as a leader, motivating the inmates to finish paving a road in less than a day.  After eating fifty eggs (\"No man can eat fifty eggs!\"), Luke truly gains \"leadership\" of the group, but is sent to the box by the Captain (the warden), fearing Luke will escape after he learns his mother has died.  Luke makes several unsuccessful attempts to escape, and his final attempt leaves the audience with a twisted end and an oddly-satisfying sense of Luke as a tragic hero.\nCool Hand Luke is a great example of the prison escape genre of film, utilizing many archetypes of characterization, such as a rebellious inmate who may be serving an unjust term (or not, as the case may be), a warden as the main antagonist, and the process of gaining respect from his fellow inmates.  The camera spends a lot of time on Paul Newman, despite having a pretty loaded cast list, and being that Cool Hand Luke was shot at the height of his popularity as an actor, it's no surprise the film features gratuitous scenes of Newman sans shirt.  The eyecandy of Paul Newman is nothing, however, compared to the gorgeous composition of shots within the movie, often looking down at the prisoners, never up.  It paints them in the light of exactly what they are: criminals.  Additionally, the soundtrack is surprisingly versatile for 1967.  The scene when Luke eats fifty eggs comes to mind, when another prisoner taps on Luke's stomach, and is rewarded with a dull thudding sound, as if to say he couldn't possibly consume another egg.\nThe famous line, \"What we've got here is failure to communicate,\" will forever be immortalized due to the film, even sampled by Guns 'N' Roses for \"Civil War\" on their Lose Your Illusion II album in 1991.  Every film has its handful of haters, but as Captain states, \"Some men, you just can't reach.\"",

As punishment for his deed, he is sentenced to a prison farm chain gang for two years. Unsurprisingly, Luke refuses to conform to the norms imposed on him by both the guards and the other prisoners. His defiance turns him into a folk hero among his fellow inmates but the prison staff is less amused by Luke's antics since his rebelliousness leads to repeated escape attempts from the camp. Defiant to the end, Luke eventually forces a final confrontation between himself and the system he so despises.\n\n\"Cool Hand Luke\" is merely a serviceable vehicle for Newman. He turns in his usual stellar performance but the film is just one set piece after another interspersed with some occasional witty dialogue. The film does have some high-points - co-stars George Kennedy and Strother Martin are great and Dennis Hopper, Harry Dean Stanton and Wayne Rogers ably fill their smaller supporting roles. Also, the interplay between Luke and his mother (Jo Van Fleet) is genuinely touching and helps to add tremendous emotional depth to Luke's character. However, \"Cool Hand Luke\" does not take its exploration of conformity, individuality, and reform far enough. What could have been an in-depth and enlightening intellectual analysis of the society around us and our role within it ultimately winds up as just another routine tale of a spirited outsider.",

It starred the late legendary Paul Newman as the titular character, a man imprisoned for cutting the heads off parking meters. This is my verdict: it is a small, modest, subtle and amiable film to watch with the family with a combination of good acting, good cinematography, sublime music and a well-written script. It was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning one for Best Supporting Actor. Lalo Schifrin's score was also nominated, and rightfully so. The main theme is just so optimistic and casual, representing the bits of warm moments in the film. Overall, I find the movie rather light (unlike most classic greats which always turn out heavy and dragging half the time) and easy to follow. The humour is well-placed and the ending, though ambiguous and vague, leaves behind that 'Ol' Luke smile' on my face. The entire film doesn't boast of being or wanting to be great. It just is. This will most likely make top 10 in my top 30 favourite films of all time. Two thumbs-up.",

He is sentenced to hard labor on a southern chain gang.  He immediately butts heads with the Captain (Strother Martin) and the other inmates like Dragline (George Kennedy).\r\n\r\nWhen he learns that his mother has passed away, Luke decides to break out, but his escapes only bring him greater contempt from the officers, but he becomes a symbol of defiance for the others convicts.\r\n\r\nDirector Stuart Rosenberg hits all the right notes, creating a truly memorable piece of filmmaking.

There was little to like about him and the rest of the cast was there to simply act as sycophants or to try to make Luke out to be a victim (which he wasn't, he deserved to be in prison). The movie lacks any meaningful exchanges between Luke and his fellow inmates--he's either trying to elevate himself or they're trying to live vicariously through him. Most of the exchanges have the other prisoners talking \"at\" Luke not \"with\" him because it's obvious Luke doesn't give a crap about them. The only time I felt anything in this movie was when he was talking to his mother--but the slight twinge in my heart was for her not him. The only other emotion I felt was disgust at the egg eating contest. \nIf you want to see a far superior version of this movie watch \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (on most points it is the same movie).

He keeps getting back up, even though he's beaten bloody and exhausted - this is central to the character played by Paul Newman in this movie. \n\n He becomes the hero of his fellow inmates and to them is an almost  Christ like figure of hope only to fall from this pedestal as it transpires he's only human after all as the prison guards force him into submission. However, in true 'Cool Hand' fashion, he doesn't stay submissive for long.\n\nThe film reflects the despair of a life without meaning, shows a man who, for rather silly actions, sinks to the bottom but glows so much while he's there he still seems like a winner and a hero to all those around him. Luke is a man who refuses to be beat all the  while he is being beaten, it's a classic case of \"the house always wins\" but Luke smiles all the while that he's losing so much so that you wonder if the house really did win.

Newman is great as the charming Luke but he also bears the characters scars of war very well. After coming home from the war Luke descends on a path of self destruction. He is a drunk who is bored of life and to keep himself from going insane goes around committing petty crime and vandalism to keep himself entertained. Eventually this path leads to trouble with the law and Luke finds himself in a correctional facility whose inmates range from thieves to murders and rapists.While at the facility he will be part of a chain gang, forced to work in searing heat with little water or shelter from the suns energy sapping rays. Luke finds it hard to bond with his inmates at first, he even manages to get up the nose of the most senior prisoners and a brutal fight ensures. Despite taking a beating his actions in the ring lead to him gaining massive respect from his peers and soon they become to love the man know as Cold Hand Luke. The movie follows Luke and his fellow inmates on a game of cat and mouse with the guards and the more Luke wins the more the screws are willing to push him to breaking point which will end in tragic circumstances.",
