With a bounty on El Indio's head, two bounty hunters, Monco (Clint Eastwood) and Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), come to collect the prize. Upon their first meeting, the two men view each other as rivals, but they eventually agree to become partners in their mutual pursuit of the vicious criminal.",

            "content": "I like this one better than a Fistful of Dollars, and it only got better from here with the trilogy. The villain had depth to him and once again, Clint Eastwood's screen presence and Ennio Morricone's score are outstanding and beautiful! The final duel, the scenery, the tension between characters, it all works! This is classic filmmaking and I'm glad that I gave all 3 movies a try instead did just skipping to The Good the Bad and the Ugly. It will be a sad day when Clint Eastwood passes on but he will always remain a legend in the world of movies and rightfully so. Good directing from Serio Leone as well!",

One thing I particularly like about these quality fiction movies that's often overlooked is that they're normally based on actual principles that people faced in the Old West, and there's historical validity in the premises of the movies.  \n\nThis movie is about bank robberies done by Mexican banditos.  When the West was being settled, territorial disputes over the land with Mexico were often rooted in the difficulties towns and forts had in the ability to protect citizens from outlaws.  The Mexican seat of government was very far to the south, and Mexico would typically not send anyone to protect the settlers from bandits and resentful Native American raids.  Banks could be robbed easily, taking everyday people's money, which is why this is a common theme in movies like this.  This movie is one of many that illustrate why so many in the North American West grew resentful of Mexican rule, and eventually started rebelling against Mexican authority and petitioning to become American.  The towns had practically no law enforcement being sent from Mexico to protect money and property, but the Eastern United States was sending settlers in droves to strengthen the settlements with more people.  When you hear resentful Mexicans claim that they own the U.S. or that it stole this land from them, you can see even in works of fiction why the westerners' sympathies were with the Americans\u2014who improved law and order.",

The directing also feels much more intentional here and uses interesting angles and symbolism to change the mood of each scene.\n\nThe partnership/rivalry (AKA dick-measuring contest) of Clint Eastwood and Mortimer is funny and brings a lot of humanity to the characters. Their eventual \"friendship\" actually feels earned instead of forced, and it's a lot more engaging than the forced romance of the first film.\n\nIt still suffers from some of the same issues that plagued its predecessor, mainly dragging on about 20 minutes too long and having a bunch of fucking Italian people wear brownface and do awful Mexican accents. But other than that, it's pretty enjoyable.",

It is quite atmospheric and I enjoyed the battle or confrontation scenes. I think I liked that there are a number of young children and babies present in various scenes featuring the local villagers, giving an extra sense of urgency and fragility in terms of the innocents caught in the cross fires.\n\nI'm not sure I'd say its as good as the original 'Fistful of Dollars' film but its still a decent watch and I'd recommend it on that basis.",

First of all, the film picks up after the first film and continues the exploits of the \"Man with no name\" and is filled with amazing set pieces and beautifully choreographed gunfights throughout an original take on the revenge motif.  The film is filled with great and truly stylish sequences and filled with witty and cool dialogue.  Clint Eastwood as the quiet drifter and Lee Van Cleef as the brother out for revenge both do a terrific job in giving depth to their characters and make this an even more intense film than the first in the trilogy.",

There is one improvement over that film though, and that is the writing of Clint Eastwood's character, more developed and more compelling. A Fistful of Dollars is also great because of everything that makes TGTBATU and FAFDM so good, but I do consider the other two more influential on the genre and also Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which used the film as its inspiration, to be the superior film. Back to A Few Dollars More, the stylised visuals are stunning to look at, the scenery is the very definition of epic and the cinematography sweeps. Ennio Morricone's score is both elegiac and operatic in tone and the story of greed and revenge that focuses mainly on the pursuit of bandit Indio draws you right in and never lets go. The dialogue is peppered with grit and dark humour, which is well-balanced with neither over-powering the other, while Leone's direction is superb. Clint Eastwood plays his more developed character with immense charisma, Lee Van Cleef is suitably vengeful and again Gian Maria Volonte snarls convincingly. Overall, a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

To round it off, the actors cannot act - I was astonished to see how bad Clint Eastwood was an actor. (Although, I can see why he developed a cult following.)

It was a bit confusing at first to have Volonte back from Fistful of Dollars in the role of the main villain- but playing a different character. After a few minutes I figured out he was a totally different character and this \"trilogy\" is only loosely connected, more like an anthology with the similar casts/creative teams working on each film. Volonte is as great as the villain here as he was in Fistful- he is the type of character you love to hate. Every scene he is in you just want to reach through the TV to strangle the guy. Van Cleef and Eastwood both bring a lot of charisma as likable anti-heroes. The revelation at the end of **SPOILER** the Colonel's sister having been raped & murdered by Indio adds a needed personal touch to the action. Instead of simply being two guys out for some cash- it becomes a story of vengeance for a horrific act of evil. Without this I think the film would be much more disposable- but you really feel for the Colonel at the finale and it is gratifying to see him get his closure.",

But it's different from the first movie, in the ways that it's got a longer runtime, which gives a opportunity for the plot to develop itself more. And it also cuts down a little on the sweaty, bloody violence that its predecessor had. The film offers beautiful cinematic landscapes, a memorable musical score, some very captivating gunfights, and another iconic performance by the great Clint Eastwood. And Lee Can Cleef is also good in his role as a vengeful bounty hunter. I honestly consider this movie to be a piece of art. And overall, this is a very good, very interesting Western.

Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are a joy to watch onscreen, with their friendship ultimately providing the most satisfying element of the entire experience (especially once the ending comes around). Major props also go to Gian Maria Volonte for bringing the dastardly, yet tortured spirit of \"el Indio\" into the fold and then some. You can see a lot of \"Once Upon A Time In The West\" in this, both thematically and narratively.

The latter is still my favourite of his, but I really think For a Few Dollars More has a more daring, challenging and unpredictable script! The complaint I have is that the first act is a bit too cheesy unlike the rest of the film. Hence, there is kind of a jarring tonal shift between the first and the second act.\n\n(9/10)",

            "content": "A killer Western full of shooting and storytelling.\n\nDirector Sergio Leone's Western drama For a Few Dollars More (1965) is a genuine classic of the Western genre. It features an all star cast, iconic score, clever direction, brilliant writing, and awesome shooting. Leone's direction takes you from jails, banks, towns, and hotels alike in the El Paso area recreating an older era with gritty realism and sweat laden faces. Leone finds the balance between gunfire and character drama with heaps of comedy scattered throughout for an entertaining Western that feels like no other.\n\nLeone's writing is impeccable here as For a Few Dollars More establishes all his characters and their personality quickly, then leads into a massive genius twist that takes your breath away. Leone films everything with attention to detail as to where characters, and the audience, are looking at all times. For a Few Dollars More is one giant magic trick. \n\nYou are so preoccupied by the leading men's performances and the criminal's plot that Leone leads you astray from the real story here. Leone keeps you entertained with witty remarks, casual insults, funny jokes, lightning fast gunplay, and intricate bank robberies that you never paid close enough attention to the Colonel. Leone uses the camera to shift the viewer's focus to the bullets and comebacks, so that you are never truly aware of Indio and the Colonel's connection. \n\nFor a Few Dollars More's twist that the Colonel's sister was raped by Indio causing her to commit suicide to stop her own rape is one of cinema's greatest story reveals. It is executed so beautifully with Indio's nostalgic reminiscing of his past with flashbacks and the mesmerizing sound of a musical watch.\n\nSpeaking of the use of sound in For a Few Dollars More, Ennio Morricone's score is iconic and vital to the story and film. The beautiful lullaby played by the musical watch is haunting, both during El Indio's duels as well as his remembering his past. Anytime that theme plays, you are captivated by its tune. Morricone's score itself is full of piano, whistles, and strings that stir your soul and transport to a time of bandits, bounty hunters, and duels galore. Leone's direction with the score in mind is perfect for creating suspense based around the music's timing. It is safe to say that For a Few Dollars More would not be the same film without Ennio Morricone!\n\nLee Van Cleef is introduced with his wide array of arsenal and devastating accuracy, while Clint Eastwood is heroic and clever in his own way outsmarting and quick drawing faster than anyone. You are immediately drawn to both leads with their piercing eyes and gripping gravitas. They are both charismatic and memorable, so much so, that you end up rooting for both of these serious gunfighters. Van Cleef and Eastwood are killer character actors with cool and collected personas that grip you like no other Western leads other than Charles Bronson is Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West. Lee Van Cleef is cool because he is mysterious and skilled without having to show off unnecessarily. Eastwood's quiet nameless hero is compelling thanks to his acting prowess and his character's impressive quick draw skills with a pistol. I will never tire of seeing Clint Eastwood acting like he just shot 3 men at once with precise aim.\n\nAs for the antagonists, the talented Gian Maria Volonte is mad as the villain and erratic robber El Indio. This is Volonte's finest hour as an actor. His insanity is developed and displayed in his killing of civilians, soldiers, and his own men alike. His wild laughter echoes throughout the film and his duels are quietly disturbing as he reaches for his gun with a callous disinterest. My favorite aspect about his performance is certainly his mad eyes daydreaming of his grotesque past. Likewise, Klaus Kinski even gets a supporting role as the hateful hunchback henchman to Indio. His crazy eyes, mouth twitches, distinctive hunchback, and outward rage makes Kinski's appearance in For a Few Dollars More unforgettable.\n\nIt's fun to see Joseph Egger back from A Fistful of Dollars as a prophet instead of an undertaker. His silly encounter with Clint Eastwood is a highlight for me especially when the train passes his home and everything starts shaking.\n\nOverall, Leone polishes off his style from the entertaining, but small A Fistful of Dollars into a massive scale crime narrative and secret revenge tale within For a Few Dollars More. It leaves you with a sense of accomplishment as Lee Van Cleef's character is burned into your mind satisfied with his avenging his sister, while Clint Eastwood rides off into the sunset with carefully counted currency.",

Both meet one another and together they pursue the bandit El Indio and his henchmen who are planning a raid on the biggest bank in the region. El Indio is played by the great Gian Marie Volonte, who if you ask me should be equally well known and beloved as Le Cleef or Eastwood. It is a shame that such a great performance is not measured in the same words as the more popular ones. He was amazing as the middle brother Rojos Ramon in the previous film and just as devilish in this. The cinematography and look are fantastic- old film stock shot in hot, humid rocks. In a western the location is perhaps as important as the theme and Leone's films exemplify this. Unmissable film.(One of the greatest middle films of all time).",

Deadly with the gun and equal in thirst for rewards.\nThe music score by Ennio Morricone is a joy. I would rate him alongside the likes of John Barry and John Williams.\nI can't praise the film enough. This sub genre has certainly reinvigorated my love of western films. \nNext....The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.",

And there's nothing like its chivalrous duel with Eastwood in the hat scene. They are two relentless antiheroes portrayed in a parallel manner by two intimidating sequences at the beginning of the film.

            "content": "The second part of Sergio Leone's \"Dollar\" trilogy (beginning with 1964's \"A Fistful of Dollars\" and closing with 1968's \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\"), 1965's \"For a Few Dollars More\" is a wonderfully grimy spaghetti western that improves upon the brazen badassery of its predecessor.  Throw Clint Eastwood back into the ring and you have yourself an anti-hero more parched for the sweat of a knife fight than John Wayne; add the beady-eyed Lee Van Cleef into the mix as his right-hand man and you have yourself an anti-hero more famished for the blood of a gun battle than Clint Eastwood.  The film is a never-ending sphere of poetic carnage, incessant perspiration, and pseudo-virility - the exquisite restraint of Leone's direction, along with the near-silent machismo of its leading players, makes \"For a Few Dollars More\" an irresistible product of subgenre ecstasy.\n\tEastwood and Van Cleef co-headline as The Man With No Name and Col. Douglas Mortimer, two rival bounty hunters who decide to join forces in hopes of capturing sadistic bandit El Indio (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9).  The plot, as simple as I've just described it, is stronger than that of \"A Fistful of Dollars\" - The Man With No Name is now no longer a cunning criminal but a sorta-kinda good guy wanting to make right in the West and for himself; style is still the most pertinent force in every frame, but this time around there's a story strong enough to give all the dust-and-tumbleweeds swagger cinematic weight.\n\tThe new assurance is so tenacious, in no doubt, because of Leone, who is confident enough to work from his own material rather than someone else's (\"A Fistful of Dollars\" was adapted from Akira Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo\", the screenplay penned by five other co-writers); \"For a Few Dollars More\" takes what was great about its predecessor and ups nearly every detail.  It's more bold in its close-ups, moody pauses, and portrayals.\n\tAnd while Eastwood is still the same indestructible force of machismo he was in the previous film, it's Van Cleef that steals the show.  With his dragon eyes, beak nose, and abiding glare, he's an anti-hero that looks the part of the villain - Mortimer is a man of few words, yet Van Cleef is able to speak volumes through his gallant body language.  He and Eastwood have the kind of chemistry only assassins can mirror, pairing not out of friendship but out of necessity.  Maybe they don't like each other, but they sure do know how to work well together.\n\t\"For a Few Dollars More\" is probably the weakest of the trilogy (\"A Fistful of Dollars\" felt so new, so vital, \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\" a blending of the strongest elements of the spaghetti western), but it's the weakest of one of the most perfectly made trilogies of all-time.  Leone is never one to take it easy, and neither is Eastwood.",

The film, even though at 2 hours and 12 minutes feels more than The Good, The Bad and The Ugly in length.

Few Dollars does fall flat more often then not, but not entirely because it is a sequel. Not entirely? What I mean by not entirely is that there are repetitions or familiarities. Sequels suffer most often from familiarities, but Few Dollars doesn't painfully suffer from it itself. Ultimately it has to do with one scene, ultimately. But it's insufferably obvious and opens your mind to all the minor familiarities (i.e. the scene in which Eastwood and Cleef are beaten as the villain watches with a gut-busting laughter) Ennio Morricone's score adds additional personality to a film already drenched in it. Eastwood's \"Man With No Name\" is iconic in itself, there isn't much talent to behold or credibility to give to an otherwise archetypical character. But he's full of giddy one-liners. Essential to mention is a newcomer to the \"Dollars\" trilogy, Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Near the end, Mortimer and \"Monco\" (as they, ironically, call \"The Man With No Name\") are going they're separate ways after a shootout which was questionably lacking \"Monco\". It's obvious that \"Monco\" is the protagonist in this trilogy, but at the significant final shootout (another familiarity from the previous film) I was questioning whether we were switching perspectives from \"Monco\" to Mortimer. Mortimer is an interesting character and has more humanity to his character than \"Monco\" even with his gunslinging arsenal, but this is \"The Man With No Name\" trilogy, right? \"Monco\" is there at the shootout but not the one participating in it, Mortimer is the one participating in the final climatic shootout. Though it suffers from familiarity and a lack-there-of protagonist, Ennio Morricone returns on the score, Sergio Leone reprises directing with a giddy, quintessential stylistic approach,  and Gian Maria Volonte returns as a worthy antagonist. Most notable are the situations and thrilling plot that's more mature than Fistful. \"For a Few Dollars More\" is that rare occasion when the sequel is, astonishingly, superior.",

Clint Eastwood is great as the lead and the new members of the cast are quite good. The villain this time around is better, he's given more backstory and depth then the last villain. The direction and score are great as well. The movie however doesn't give as much depth or reason to root for the heroes as I was hoping. It's also not as quotable or original as the first. The movie is also pretty predictable. In the end, it comes close to being as good as the original but falls a bit short, but still should provide for great entertainment. For a Few Dollars More gets 4/5 stars (B+).",

The music is also better here - something that's pretty incredible, a wild archievement. The characters are equally cool, with a more psychotic villain and two bad ass guys here instead of one. Mortimer is an amazing character, but \"The Man With No Name\" is naturally the most bad ass one though. It's cool that Klaus Kinski is in it, a face I never thought I would see here. The showdown is fantastic but not as great as the forst one on my opinion.\n\nIn total I liked the first one a tiny bit better. Maybe I was a bit fed up with the wild west after the first flick, but I doubt it. So, if you dig the first, you will dig the second film.

Neither Mortimer of Manco say much but everything they do say is to the point. Action and music speak louder than words and never more so than in this film.

            "content": "Everything that I liked about A Fistful of Dollars was even better in For a Few Dollars More. The plot of this movie is very simple. A man named El Indio is busted out of prison, and 2 bounty killers are on his trail hoping to collect the big price on Indio's head. The use of music was superb in this film. Most notable is the playful light music box tune utilized to create a great deal of tension and dread. It's a strange contrast that works amazingly. Once again the standoff moments were superb, and Leone threw a lot more of them into this film. I enjoyed how he even put a twist on the standoff by including a scene that had some humor between the 2 bounty killers shooting one-another's hats. My only regret is that they had some emotional stakes they could have added into the final face-off, but they didn't reveal them until the very end. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef were great in the roles of the 2 protagonists. I did find that it kind of felt like there wasn't enough screen time for both of them, but I appreciated their banter whenever they were on screen together. Perhaps the most surprisingly impressive acting came from Gian Maria Volonte. He adds some real depth to the character of El Indio, you can see he has so much going on behind those eyes.\n\nI appreciated how they gave the villain so much back story. Usually in this type of film I expect the black hats to be one-dimensional, but we get to see some of the things going on in Indio's head and why he is so crazy. I still struggled with the voice dubbing in this movie. It's really distracting, and even though I should, I just can't seem to get past it mentally. It's actually to the point where I'm still noticing it and thinking about it 2 hours into the film. My other issue with For a Few Dollars More is the bullet sound effect. Each shot is way too loud and piercing. It sounds like every bullet is ricocheting off of steel or something, and I literally had to turn the sound down in a couple of the gunfights because that repetitive noise kept ringing out. Now I have to talk about some of the amazing editing decisions that were made in For a Few Dollars More. The way they cut certain images with others and threw in some noises as well was fascinating. The most memorable were all the flashes between character's faces and Indio's wanted poster. They completely revealed the thoughts of the characters without saying a word. There were a few other camera and editing tricks that I thought added a lot to the feel of the movie, but I won't detail them all here. Suffice it to say, this really is a great film, and if you can get past the dubbing it is one you absolutely must see.",

He might've even been a little cooler than Eastwood.  I think that comes from that Master-Apprentice relationship they developed.  Eastwood's Stranger is a total uber-badass, but as in life, there's always someone better, and I think Mortimer fits that bill.  In A Fistful of Dollars, I viewed the Stranger as the template for great anti-heroes like Han Solo.  In this, Mortimer is the template for both bounty hunters like Boba Fett and masters like Obi Wan Kenobi.  \nAs everyone knows, if you have to watch a Western, watch these films.",

This was a film that didn't appeal to me, the first time I have watched it but as I watch it more and more along with others within the trilogy, I start to see the great things about this film. For A Few Dollars More is much more bigger and a much more better written film than it's predecessor.\n\nFor A Few Dollars More was written by both Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both have written a story that is engaging and this is due to a plot with much bigger stakes, and rewards, and also much better written characters. This film fleshes out the characters much more than it's predecessors, taking it's time to show each person's agenda and their personalities, yet Leone and Vincenzoni still has kept the unpredictability that was found in the first film. Oddly enough, even though Eastwood's character is the main star, the film's emotional significance was much more apparent on Mortimer and El Indio. Their back story is the reason that I care about these characters, it tells us why they are who they are. For A Few Dollars More's script has it's humor pumped up in comparison to the first film and I felt that this work. It actually gives the film much more character and helps not make the tone of the film too negative.\n\nSergio Leone has created a film that is much more cinematic and traditional in comparison to the first film but at the same time not trading off the uniqueness of the first film, which was the slow building tension and the close ups of people's faces focusing on their reactions and the emotional facial acting by the actors. This film does increase the beat of the film, with editing that moves the film along at a pace that keeps us on our toes. Leone has definitely have gained much more confidence going towards this film as the film doesn't feel as indulgent as the first and seemed to show much more enjoyment with the story than the first film. This film's budget was much higher than the first film which allowed him to create settings that feel real and lively.\n\nMassimo Dallamano is back as the cinematographer of this film. The film looks much better than the first film and this may be due to the increase in budget and shot at better locations or it could be due to Dallamano and Leone has a much better understanding of what they want for this film. The film still retains that style from the first film with close ups that take it's time to move things along but it's much more improved here as they have used different angles and techniques in constructing these shots, allowing them to feel fresh. Dallamano has the camera move in this film much more than the first. The first film has it's shots set up in a way that doesn't require the camera to move or zoom into anything. This movement makes the film move faster and exciting.\n\nEnnio Morricone comes back to do the score for this film and it's just as great as the first one. The score here sounds much more fuller and dramatic, this may be due to a much larger story and much more characters focused on. Morricone's score here may not be as memorable as the first or third film but it definitely fits with what is shown on screen and it doesn't feel recycled. The film's score feels fast and upbeat, which sound great in moments of the film that have characters riding their horses on the beautiful backdrops. Morricone also has a much lighter and smaller track that plays during the build up of climax, the music that comes from the lockets. It sounds beautiful and it connects with the emotional weight during these situations.\n\nThe film's cast is much bigger in this film and the film is now shared with three characters rather than a main focus on Eastwood. Clint Eastwood is great here as expected but not as memorable as A Fistful of Dollars. Lee Van Cleef brings something different to the film which gives the film much more personality. Leone loves to have actors banter in his films and it's definitely apparent here with the focus on the friendship on both Eastwood and Cleef's characters. Both actors work well together and it's a shame that this isn't the case for the next film. Gian Maria Volonte is back for this film as the antagonist, this time his character is much better written and his acting is much more effective but it may not appeal to everyone as he has increased the dramatics in this film in comparison to the first film.\n\nFor A Few Dollars More is a much better constructed film than A Fistful of Dollars with a bigger and better story and improvements on the acting and photography. The film is great to watch on its own and does not require to watch the first or third film to understand but if you have seen the other films you get to pick up on the small things that Leone has put in this film.",

            "content": "Sergio Leone's sophomore film in his Spaghetti Western trilogy and is a major step up from A Fistful of Dollars. This was a film that didn't appeal to me, the first time I have watched it but as I watch it more and more along with others within the trilogy, I start to see the great things about this film. For A Few Dollars More is much more bigger and a much more better written film than it's predecessor.\n\nFor A Few Dollars More was written by both Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both have written a story that is engaging and this is due to a plot with much bigger stakes, and rewards, and also much better written characters. This film fleshes out the characters much more than it's predecessors, taking it's time to show each person's agenda and their personalities, yet Leone and Vincenzoni still has kept the unpredictability that was found in the first film. Oddly enough, even though Eastwood's character is the main star, the film's emotional significance was much more apparent on Mortimer and El Indio. Their back story is the reason that I care about these characters, it tells us why they are who they are. For A Few Dollars More's script has it's humor pumped up in comparison to the first film and I felt that this work. It actually gives the film much more character and helps not make the tone of the film too negative.\n\nSergio Leone has created a film that is much more cinematic and traditional in comparison to the first film but at the same time not trading off the uniqueness of the first film, which was the slow building tension and the close ups of people's faces focusing on their reactions and the emotional facial acting by the actors. This film does increase the beat of the film, with editing that moves the film along at a pace that keeps us on our toes.

The plot is thin and the structure is more of a series of interesting situations loosely tied together. Normally this is a bad thing but this movie makes up for it in other ways. The main characters may be vague but they have a good-natured chemistry that is a delight to watch. Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood play two mysteriously silent rugged bounty hunters that reluctantly team up. Their lightly humorous dialogue and tough guy mannerisms are what make the movie so enjoyable. There is not a lot of realism to the action scenes but they are fun and exciting. This movie series takes the short crescendo of the western shootout and extends it to a 15-man all out gunfight. It is a major step forward for action movies, making for a prolonged fast pace and way more adrenaline. This is deservedly labeled a classic because it is so successful at keeping things fun and simple.",

Our favorite Laconic Bounty Hunter is back, but this time he is not alone. He has to take down an escaped convicted from committing more acts of crime. With the help of a Colonel turned Bounty Hunter, the Man with No Name must find how to work as a team this time. Like the original, this film does a great job in capturing the smooth and glowing world of the wild west. The performances were just like the original, pure amazing. Clint Eastwood doesn't fail again and so does our villain of the film. El Indio, played by Gian Maria Volonte played a MUCH better villain than the one he played in the original. He had a better back story and was more emotional than his portrayal as Ramon. Lee Van Cleef, played a terrific partner to The Man with No Name. He was badass and had the exact same awesome moments Eastwood has in this film and the other combined. Like the original film, I was never bored with this movie. It was just another pitch perfect Western film that deserves to be put on the big screen again. The action was bloodier, the story was much more personal, and the end fight scene was just as good as the end fight from the original.

I really couldn't ask for more, since it had more Eastwood, had a chilling soundtrack by Morricone, a great direction from Leone, and an awesome performance by Lee Van Cleef. The chemistry between Eastwood and Cleef made this movie alone, but of course, there's so much more to this movie than that. Once again, there's an interesting story, and this time, it's about two bountry hunters (Eastwood and Cleef) teaming up to take down the leader of an outlaw gang, also known as Indio. All of this leads up to one of the most haunting, chilling finales I've ever seen, and an overall classic western that yet again redefined the western genre. To me, I think the trilogy progressively gets better by each movie, and that shows Leone's improvement as a director. I honestly think Leone is practically an artist with his masterful use of blending the different western elements and showing it through a different lens, and that makes this a must-see western movie. This is my 2nd favorite western movie (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly being not only my favorite western, but my favorite movie of all time).",

Eastwood and Van Cleef are a good leading pair, with the former being his zen self with aplomb.  As the second film produced of the Dollars Trilogy, the production value went up and the feel was definitely more epic, in a ramp up to the finale.  This influential film finds Leone on the precipice of making his greatest, most epic works. (6 April 2013)",

Structurally, it's simple but flawless, and offers the same wonderful photography that films by Sergio Leone are renowned for, as well as another memorable score by Ennio Morricone.

Reluctantly they agree to join forces and Manco (Eastwood) joins Indio in his robbing of a bank so the two mercenaries can bring him down. The bandits get away with the money and then later they overhear the intentions of Manco and the Colonel, and so they rough them up. In secret Indion has them released, then sends his gang after them so he can get away with the money. However, the colonel took the loot and so the next morning he and Manco systematically mow down the bandits. Indo comes for the money and shares a tense moment with the colonel only to have Manco appear too. Using the chime of a pocket watch, they face off. In the end one man leaves, his revenge complete and the other takes the reward.

As it is I'm still unsure to this day.And Sergio Leone's direction is immaculate because no other man could deliver this film so perfectly, and its iconic for his trademark direction and the awesome musical score by Mastermind Ennio Morricone.

            "content": "For a few dollars more, you can get \"A Fistful of Dollars\" and its sequel; a $30 value for only $14.99. This title really does sound like paid programming, and hey, I can understand why, because I'd imagine that around this time, Sergio Leone couldn't stop thinking about money after Akira Kurosawa's lawsuit. It would appear as though \"A Fistful of Dollars\" was either ripping off more than just other westerns or just ripping off westerns so much that it actually fell into the trope of being a westernization of an Akira Kurosawa film. Man, with \"Seven Samurai\" turning into \"The Magnificent Seven\" and \"Rashomon\" turning into \"The Outrage\", I'm willing to bet my own fistful of dollars and a few dollars more that if Terrence Malick ever does a western, it will probably be a remake of \"Dreams\"... or \"I Saw Dream Like This\" or \"Such Dreams I Have Dreamed\" or \"Yume\" or whatever that movie that no one - including myself - saw is called. Those Japs are sure weird with their titles, whether they're making it too long and descriptive or simply giving it too many alternate names, though not quite as many alternate names as some of these Sergio Leone westerns, especially \"Duck, You Sucker!\" or \"A Fistful of Dynamite\" or \"Once Upon a Time... the Revolution\" or \"Gi\u00f9 la testa\", all of which really were the same film, and I mean that literally, not in that they were all following a formula, or at least not as far as titles are concerned, because Leone was clearly not that good at coming up with titles outside of \"A Fistful of\" or \"Once Upon a Time\". Hey, maybe Leone should have been a little bit more formulaic with his titles, because this is officially supposed to be the \"Dollar Trilogy\", so I have no idea where he got the title \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" after two movies with \"Dollars\" featured pretty prominently in the titles, or, for that matter, where he even came up with \"Dollars\" in the titles to begin with, because I'm not noticing a whole lot that has to do with money in these films. Hey, Leone could title these films anything he wanted to, just as long as those titles were attached to a good film, something that this film definately is, though not without a few hiccups.\r\n\r\nRunning nearly 40 minutes longer than \"Fistful\", this would be considered quite the expanded sequel, when really, the film, as a story, is not that much longer, with the rest of time is filled out by long periods of pointless, dragging nothingness. I'm kidding, it's not just the slower points that meditative on total nothingness, for although the story is very much broader and more layered, the film limps far too often, getting to its point at a far too steady pace, or at least it feels that way, seeing as how the transitions between character focus are so jarring that the breaks in the exiting story really glare. It's good to see that Sergio Leone was working on taking out that hurried feeling that plagued his preceding films, but maybe this film is a little loose, feeling a touch limp in its progression, with a dry dilution of consistent oomph and even a few dull points making it all the worse. The film is not at all consistently boring, though it is steady to a fault and only occasionally with steam, being plagued by loose story structure and some spots in the in story flow. Were the film tighter, it would have been a superior sequel, and yet, as it stands, it breaks even enough to come out on par, at least. Sure, the film takes its sweet time getting to the point, yet the wait itself is enjoyable enough to get you by until it reaches its point, which is, of course, worth that wait.\r\n\r\nIn the latter parts of \"Fistful\", grit and bruality audaciously kicked in and pulled a lot of gutsy moves that upped tension and intrigue. This film is more consistent with that grit, maybe not to where it transcends its many dry spells and storytelling faults, but the film has the guts to pull some unique and heavy twists and turns, and knows how to use them, with Sergio Leone manipulating the offputting environment - really brought to life by fine production designs - and Ennio Morricone's sweeping, defining score as effective supplements to the atmosphere, which may not always deliver on the oomph, but really hits hard when it does, especially when the tension-riddled and well-staged action comes into play. Still, although the film's expansion gives us an extra dose of raw grit, the added layers and scope also gives the film more room for entertainment, and while that entertainment value lapses quite a bit throughout the film, there are more points where the film does fill those openings for entertainment. The film's focus is more versatile, with more characters feeling written more like genuine humans and less like plot devices, and the performers behind those characters make that additional depth all the stronger. Charm and memorable uniqueness is found in even some of the most briefly-present, while the highter roles earn investment, whether it be Lee Van Cleef as the reliably skilled, yet offputtingly mysterious Colonel Douglas Mortimer or Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 as the effective love-to-hate dirtbag antagonist El Indio. Still, we all know that it's gonna come down to Clint Eastwood, who once again brings home fiery charisma and compelling mystery as out nameless protagonist, further solidifying his presence as both a worthy icon and deeply involving lead. The film is not at all spotless, yet it pulls moves that are strong enough to evoke the predecessor, whether when your placing something on par with a strength in \"Fistful\" or deeming something better, and with plenty of depth to break up, if not intensify entertainment, this follow-up stands as a worthy companion piece, as well as its own enjoyable piece.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the hurrying that plagued Sergio Leone's previous efforts have all but diminished, yet this film makes up for that with many a long period of nothingness, made worse by faults in storytelling, some dull spots and a consistent underwhelming dryness in the air, leaving the film to run the risk of falling beneath the enjoyment value of the predecessor, only to split the difference by adding more scope and audacious depth, grit and tension to make more powerful the fair deal of truly engaging moments and sharp action, while retaining general entertainment value, intensified by a slew of charismatic performances - especially those by leads Lee Van Cleef, Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 and, of course, the real man's man with no name, Clint Eastwood -, thus making \"For a Few Dollars More\" an overall satisfying and compelling equal continuation to Leone's classic saga.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

There are rough edges, most notably in the climax where it just seems uneven, at times what the characters do and say works, at times the presentation seems disjointed. Also, the film tries to dig deeper, however it is unsure of what to do, relating to the past of Van Cleef and Volonte's character. Ennio Morricone's music is splendid! I particularly admired the sequence where Van Cleef and Eastwood are face to face. The performances are fine, could have been better, especially of Volonte, since he is the main villain. Then again, I think it really falls on the director's execution. The great Klaus Kinski definitely made his mark in the short screen time he had. Not much else to say but that it was still entertaining, I have great admiration for Westerns! A good picture, for sure.",

            "content": "I think this is the first time that I've rated a Sergio Leone film lower than 5 stars, but I have my reasons. For a Few Dollars More, being the third in the \"Dollars trilogy\" (or the \"Man with No Name\" trilogy, if you buy into that marketing strategy), is not quite up to snuff with the other entries in the series - or even in the rest of Leone's body of work. First of all, there isn't a clear focus on who is who and what is what... that is we can't really connect with the characters because we have a difficult time latching onto their characters. It doesn't make for very compelling drama. Second of all, Eastwood's character seems to take a backseat in this one. He doesn't do a whole hell of a lot and is even a bystander in film's climactic shoot-out. That just doesn't sit well with me. The ideas are there, the score is great and Gian Maria Volonte's villainous role is just superbly performed, but it feels like a step back to me. I love Sergio Leone's work, but this feels weak, and that's saying a lot being that everything he ever directed is basically a masterpiece of the art form. I don't discount it, but it isn't the strongest entry in the trilogy.",

            "content": "Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More, the second movie to The Man With No Name trilogy, is yet another classic for the western genre and just as good as the first. For a Few Dollars More is about two bounty hunters, The Man with No Name and Col. Douglas Mortimer. These are two of the best shooters in the west and always catch who their hunting down. One day one of worst criminals, El Indio, gets broken out of prison which brings The Man with No Name and Mortimer together. These two killers team up to find this madman. The Man with No Name is in this for the money and Mortimer is here to seek revenge on Indio from what he did to him in the past. A Fistful of Dollars was a magnificent western and in the sequel For a Few Dollars more it doesn't disappoint what so ever, this movie is everything you would want for a sequel. The thing about this series is that each movie seems to get better and better unlike some movies were the movies just get worse. Just like the first movie this is a western classic. The story to this movie is just great because it was clever and fun to watch. There is never a dull moment in these movies and all the events in this movie are just perfect for the movie. Just like the first movie the shootouts are exciting and has some funny comedy. All the actors in this movie are great just like the first movie. Clint Eastwood is back and still the cool guy he was in the first movie but he's not the only cool guy in the movie. In this movie Lee Van Cleef joins the series and his performance in this movie is just amazing. His character is just like Eastwood's, clever, smart, and deadly. Every time Eastwood and Van Cleef are on screen together it's just great because they were a perfect duo in this movie. Overall For a Few Dollars More is another Western classic and if you liked the first you'll be sure to like this one.",

For one, I wasn't so distracted by the cooler then cool \"Man With No Name.\" Leone refrained from the overwhelming amount of one liners and flashy gun tricks in order to bring more depth to the character, a very effective decision. I also appreciate the extended length of many of the scenes which was seriously lacking in the first. Leone never rushed through them, but instead took the necessary time to let us soak up every ounce of this boiling plot. Finally, bringing in Lee Van Cleef as Eastwood's counterpart was a brilliant addition. They have genuine chemistry together which only adds the the films greatness. This is the perfect film to follow up to an introduction like the first. I'm greatly excited to see how this fantastic series will conclude!",

The two bounty hunters had to work together to take down Indio and his partners, one of the most fearful gangs in the west. Ennio Morricone returns with the famous whistle tune that spaguetti westerns became characterized for.

I enjoyed every minute of this one, and while \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is a great classic epic western...this one is probably my favorite of the three.",

What seperates good movies from great films is legacy, and how the film stands the test of time, and this film does it wonderfully. Unlike \"A Fistfull Of Dollars\" (1964), this story is completely origonal, and so simple, but so effective. We are also introduced to Lee Van Cleef, who, when paired up with Clint Eastwood's character \"The Man With No Name\", become one of the most badass killing teams that has ever graced the screen. The battle/dueling scenes are classic, and are quite epic to watch at times. An almost flawless film, but like the first part, I have to complain about the the audio, which at times is so off, actually takes away from the impact the scenes have to offer (for example, a man falls to the floor and dies, but the gunshot doesn't go off until two seconds later). That shouldn't be a surprise as the film cost almost nothing to make, and was edited in cheap Italian studios. For A Few Dollars More has enough gunshots and explosions to make anyone experience something fantastic.",

It's an unrelenting barrage of stern-faced masculinity, bravado and marksmanship, with filthy hired hands perfectly willing to trade bullets around every other corner. As with each of the director's dust-soaked pictures, this film covers for its small budget with an excess of personality and buckets of atmosphere, which results in a tougher, bolder, more genuine take than the most expensive Hollywood blockbusters of today. The infamous showdown with a truly despicable set of bounties may be what sends this picture riding off into the sunset, but it's a quieter scene earlier in the story that's always stuck with me: two grizzled old hunters trying to impress one other with nothing more than an empty street, a set of pistols and a pair of bullet-riddled hats.",

For A Few Dollars More has everything you'd expect from a Leone Western. A great story, mixed with drama and action. Leone was a master storyteller and I admire everyone of his films.

The director's approach to the Western movies stands in stark contrast from the so called Classic Westerns made in America. The adjectives to describe the director's style would be sweaty, dirty and unforgiving.\n\nMuch of the movie's strong resolve is thanks to the main star of the show. Back in the 60s the rather unknown TV show star Clint Eastwood really hit gold with Sergio Leone's Westerns. In the movies he pretty much defines his future career as a tough man with few words. The For a Few Dollars More as a movie can be considered as an evil and twisted triangle between the three main stars of the show. The main star being Clint Eastwood as the silent bounty hunter Monco who is looking to strike rich by catching and collecting reward from a rampaging group of desperados. Lee Van Cleef's character Col. Douglas Mortimer is after personal revenge and finds it beneficial to work together with Eastwood's enigmatic character. The collaboration of these two men take them to hunt down a common foe Indio, by Gian Maria Volont\u00c3 (C), who is a ruthless outlaw out there to bring the world down burning. \n\nThe story is easily approachable, straight to the point and fits well for the movie as it gives ample time for the actors to define their characters.

Take pride in continuity of the fact that Sergio Leone settles for nothing less than the very best, to dig his teeth in the girth of a genre he knows and loves, and that he stores his biggest ideas for. The times start getting nailed down in \"For a Few Dollars More\", the stellar sequel to '64's heavily-influenced \"A Fistful of Coins\". The offspring of early-20th century tech geeks are tossing up new design innovation for weapons, and folks are finally wizening to the often limitless financial potential in a lifeless body when you aim sharp enough to drown their tell-tale hearts, like hippie freaks reading their munchies for foreign paranoia.\n\nIn a new branch of the Western woods, Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name comes to run smack into a bounty hunter named Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) shaking up residents in hot pursuit of bandit El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte). One beef: the Man's tracking the same scent. A team-up? Why not -- Mortimer keeps a mind for the impending, while No Name the storied traditional. So the latter (referred to in this film as Manco, meaning in Spanish \"one-armed\") breaks from jail an Indio crony and ever so dangerously slips into the gang as they prep a bank heist in El Paso, once mission impossible for the crew. It's all blueprint for a crackdown on Indo and his $10K government DOA; ditto for the godfather's gang, among whom include a young Klaus Kinski as a Mortimer left-standing jonesing to spill the beans on their charade.\n\nBut besides all that, what's the harm of dabbling in some foul play? Oh yeah, there's also the conscience rumor that Mortimer or No Name might use their undisclosed knowledge to over the shoulder finish each other off. It gives \"For a Few Dollars More\" a sense of dread that makes \"A Fistful of Dollars\" look innocent in comparison. Because in Leone's massive West, retribution sways in the endless shrapnel autopsy for blood like we're in Chinatown and there's no water. Mortimer and No Name masquerade on the same side in the creation of the tri-state's new vocational border, eyes peeled not for the obscurity of a gunshot but in the humane schizophrenia nearest the trigger. As usual, if shit were to blow, it wouldn't end at the tip of a single finger -- you're prey to a whole fistful.",

The cast is fantastic from Clint Eastwood to Gian Maria Volont\u00c3 (C), and even a young Klaus Kinski pops in to say hello. The standout however is Lee Van Cleef's Colonel Mortimer. His characterization of The Man in Black is brilliant. The final revelation at the end, which involves his character and ties up a major plot point, gives me chills each time I see it.",

Much of what applied to A Fistful of Dollars goes here as well, with Volont\u00c3 (C) in a new villain role and Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name (now called \"Manco\") as mysterious as ever. This time, however, he has met a true equal in skill, in the form of Cleef's Colonel Mortimer. However, instead of gunning each other down, they decide to team up to capture the highly wanted bandit El Indio, with his mysterious watch tune. The plot flows much better than the first Dollars film, as it is original and not just ripped from a Kurosawa film, and Manco is more likable than Joe in the sense that him and Mortimer are clearly \"the good guys.\" Overall, a better film than the first, and a remarkable Spaghetti Western.",

Lee Van Cleef is great as Colonel Mortimer and gives No Name some good competition in the bounty hunting field.

(There seems to be a progression in the crazy villain types in the No Name series which reaches its pinnacle of infamy with Eli Wallach's Tuco, but El Indio is sufficient.)

            "content": "Whilst 'A Fistful of Dollars' introduced Sergio Leone's new, grittier Wild West, 'For A Few Dollars More' continues to ground the genre whilst pushing even further. \r\n\r\nI firmly believe this is a sequel to 'Fistful of Dollars'. Eastwood s the man with no name is back and he looks, sounds, and acts identical to how he did in the previous instalment. However, an extra outlaw is added into the mix in the form of another Western Legend: Lee Van Cleef. Famous for his role in 'High Noon', Van Cleef has all the features of a classic villain. Indeed, when we first see him ruthlessly killing for bounty, we get a sense that he is the main antagonist. What surprises us then, is when he lends a helping hand, and ultimately is the hero who slays the real antagonist - whilst Eastwood smokes and acts almost as a referee. \r\n\r\nIn this regard: Van Cleef is as prominent as Eastwood - and is just as memorable. Whilst in 'A Fistfull of Dollars', it was Eastwood s performance that stood out the most, in 'For A Few Dollars More', it is Van Cleef who steals the show. He is intimidating to the last, yet for this movie somehow manages to be incredibly likeable. \r\n\r\nAs is standard for a sequel, the entire scope is raised. The whole 'adventure' seems to take place over a much larger area. The settings are much more expansive, and the cast is much more extended to include a sub-villain in addition to Van Cleef as a sub-hero alongside Eastwood. The plot is much more layered, with seemingly two plots merged together - the two bounty hunters (Van Cleef and Eastwood) rivalling for the prize before coming to a mutual respect (in what is my personal favourite scene of the movie), and then the two working together to destroy a group of bandits who simply want to rob a bank. With any normal movie, the Director would either just focus on one, or demote the other to a sub-plot. This may mean that having what seems like two movies placed one-after-the-other makes the whole movie rather over-long. And that is the only flaw: that there is just too much. \r\n\r\nSimultaneous to Leone breaking the boundaries and innovating not just the western, but filmmaking altogether; Ennio Morricone likewise does this with his musical score. It is a bridge - with the main theme incredibly similar to 'A Fistful of Dollars', yet we hear some samples (particularly during the duelling sequences) of what is yet to come in arguably the greatest movie soundtracks of all time: 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly'. \r\n\r\nOverall: this outing is far superior to the first, but in retrospective the movie is merely building up to Leone's next, and arguably greatest, movie...",

There are some pretty grim scenes up to the climax, especially considering when this film was released, particularly when the chief thug (Gia Maria Volonte) murders a family, including an infant, in order to gain revenge on someone who had originally caught him. That was a little disturbing. Other than that, it is visually stunning and quite suspenseful western film. I wish it was little shorter, but perhaps that's just my own little problem.

I went into the movie blind so I didn't know what to expect. Naturally I had a blast. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef just ooze confidence and sheer awesomeness. I found myself waiting in earnest for each scene that they had together. Along with having these two western powerhouses, other Sergio Leone regular Gian Maria Volonte makes yet another appearance. His character is much better in this film than in A Fistful of Dollars in my opinion. The gunplay is as impressive as ever and, at times, kinda played for laughs. One scene in particular involving just Eastwood and Van Cleef had me chuckling to myself quite a bit. Also, in keeping with the fantastic soundtrack of the first film, Ennio Morricone makes another awe-inspiring soundtrack. The films with his soundtracks are always better for them and this one is no different. It adds the perfect amount of tension, bravado, and even comedy at times.

            "content": "A sequel to \"A Fistful of Dollars\" seems like a foregone conclusion considering its worldwide success. But in 1964, there was nothing inevitable about it. Sergio Leone had received no financial compensation from the considerable box office of his first Western and wished to make a personal, partially autobiographical project about growing up in Trastevere during the 1930s. However, he was under pressure to repeat his Western success and Italian lawyer Alberto Grimaldi offered Leone 50% of the profits plus expenses. This was an offer that a man with a wife and children to support couldn't refuse. So he set out on the development of  the ironically titled \"For a Few Dollars More,\" wishing to top his earlier film. This determination shows in the finished product. \"For a Few Dollars More\" is a more ambitious film than its predecessor in terms of narrative, character and style and it's the film which really shows Leone developing the epic side of his filmmaking which would come to fruition in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\" It may not be Leone's best film, but it may be his most purely enjoyable; an exercise in narrative filmmaking which brims with style and confidence.\n\nLeone brings back the Man With No Name - this time briefly given the name Manco - in the shape of Clint Eastwood and explicitly makes him a bounty hunter (called bounty killers in the film) with no other motivation than money. This gives the film a specific historical context during the late 19th Century when law and order in the West was maintained in a decidedly fragile state by a haphazard system of local Sheriffs and traveling Judges. Bounty hunters were encouraged as an efficient way of finding and dealing with fugitives. Eastwood's all ready iconic character is joined by a new figure; Colonel Douglas Mortimer played the great character actor Lee Van Cleef. Mortimer is also a bounty hunter but one haunted both by his past as a soldier and a tragic family history. After a brief, witty confrontation , the two men team up with the common goal of bringing to justice El Indio (Volonte), a deranged, dope-addled bandit who is inextricably linked to Mortimer's family tragedy.\n\nThe sweeping confidence of the film reflects a director who is finally able to do what he wants in the way he wants. Leone's work is immensely stylish, packed with increasingly exotic use of close-ups and pacing which, while never slow, is a little stately in a manner which often recalls Luchino Visconti. There is more intentional humor in this film than in its predecessor with whole sequences built up for the sake of a humourous pay-off, such as the scene with the apples towards the end. There's a lushness to the film, both in its stunning visuals which make full use of the landscape in a way which Leone would intensify in his next two films, and in its emotional richness, largely supplied by the character of Colonel Mortimer. In \"Fistful,\" there's not a great deal of motivation or even characterisation. In this film, Mortimer's character is all motivation and, partly due to Lee Van Cleef's sympathetic and witty portrayal, he comes across as the main target for our sympathy. Virtually every Spaghetti Western which followed the huge success of this movie in Italy would feature a flashback to explain the motivations of a particular character but few are either as simple or as effective as the one here. Leone keeps this in the background at first, with unexplained memory 'flashes' from El Indio that are later revealed as his connection with Mortimer. The pocket watch watch, with the initially unexplained portrait of a lady, is well used too, providing another angle of narrative suspense.\n\n\nEverything in\"For a Few Dollars More\" seems a little bigger than in its predecessor. The violence is a little more graphic and sadistic, Carlo Simi's production design of El Paso - Leone's first great bustling period location - is on a larger scale and the psychopathic, sociopathic behaviour of El Indio is more melodramatic and theatrical. Gian Maria Volonte takes the opportunity to go over the top with both hands, consuming the scenery with relish as one of the nastiest, most irredeemable bad guys in cinema history. In contrast to this slightly garish conception, Clint Eastwood's performance seems all the more restrained and funny. He gets comic effects simply by doing very little and allowing all around him to emote their way into the stratosphere. His character is made even less heroic, again being the hero mostly because of his charisma and finally being slightly redeemed through his friendship with Mortimer. This friendship adds a more human dimension to the whole film, bringing in complex emotions which the first movie ignore. Leone originally wanted Lee Marvin for the role but couldn't afford the actor's asking price and Van Cleef's warm, likable performance is masterful; a mature, if cynical, reflection contrasted with Eastwood's youthful arrogance, even though Van Cleef was a mere five years older.\n\n\nLeone's style is developing and the movie contains most of the elements which will be considered hallmarks of his film making. Along with the harshly cynical view of the world - good men have to turn to violence because of the greed and corruption around them - and extreme sclose-up shots, we get more religious iconography creeping in - the church in which El Indio delivers his speech about robbing the bank being an example - and the recurring motifs such as the circular dance of death during the final gunfight.All in all \"Dollars is a worthy second film in an unintended trilogy with the best saved for last.",

Making his debut in the Dollars trilogy is Lee Van Cleef, playing a sharp shooting Colonel who goes bounty hunting while away from the army. As too does Eastwood's character, until the two join forces to bring down a volatile bandit named El Indio whose just escaped from prison. Just like its predecessor this film is awesome and cool, and goes deeper into the characterization and backstories of the characters. The only thing that lets it down ever so slightly is probably the partnership of Van Cleef's and Eastwood's characters as they are two different sides of the same coin; both wanting the same thing but for a different reason. But as I say only ever so slightly. Sergio Leone has done it again with another gripping and stylish western which strengthens the Dollars trilogy. Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volente all deliver good performances and make a quality ending when everything is explained and comes to a head.",
