When Joe's shot at the noose goes awry during one escapade, a furious Tuco tries to have him murdered. The men re-team abruptly, however, to beat out a sadistic criminal and the Union army and find $20,000 that a soldier has buried in the desert.",

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is s true classic. Although it may seem just like a fun and bombastic action movie (which it certainly is) at first glance, it is much more than that.",

Secondly, I thought the costumes were fantastic. Especially Clint Eastwood's. His Pancho he acquires is iconic and a stable of the movie. I also just think that western clothes like that are very interesting and cool. Even the civil war costumes were great. Finally, how could I not put the music in here. I could not tell you how many times I have heard the main song from this move. It is everywhere and s recognizable. The other music in this movie is great.

The story is also conventional, but the film's influence is simply astonishing, considering that since its release in 1966, many westerns, and even Hollywood blockbusters, have used it as a model. And why is it that the visual beauty and power of Westerns, which are closely fused with music, are still so popular today, even though they have faded with the times?\n\nClint Eastwood, who plays the lead role, has few lines, but he has all the elements of a cool, intelligent, and good-looking gunfighter.

Also, the very name of the movie has become a perennial idiom at least as popular today as it was when the movie came out.\nLike the idiom, the movie will never die, despite not being too relatable to anything in the way we live today.  Which makes it a great way to escape what we do today.  And like many older movies, we have to honor the fact that they didn't have the same technologies we have today—so it took more work to do things as well.

It's actually quite interesting to watch him go from the fatherly and masterful good guy to the evil and heartless bad guy, though he is just as deadly!  The film is beautifully shot, no matter how many inaccuracies are portrayed throughout, and adds an epic feel to the Western film.  The score provided is haunting and fits the mood and feel of the movie perfectly and only adds another layer of tension to the already breath-holding standoffs!  This is by many considered the greatest of all Western films and while I don't know if that can be said so readily, I have to agree that it is a masterpiece of cool and cinema showcasing it's majestic powers in full!  ***It should be noted as well in this review that the blu-ray I watched contained the Extended Dubbed Version running at 178 minutes.***",

This movie is filled with ambition, wide scope set pieces that give such a grand scale to a desolate setting. This movie made me understand how having an actor show their emotions rather than speak their emotions whenever possible is a trait all great films share and all sub par ones lack.

Yeah, we got some of the important information in this phase of the movie, but yeah, it is a flaw.

However, there is another outlaw, Angel Eyes, who is also after the gold which makes the plot even more exciting and entertaining.

The final thirty minutes was most memorable and had me on the edge of my seat until the final shot.\n\nOn a side note watching these Leone westerns has reminded me I still need to jump into Kurosawa's work one of these days.",

Behind the camera, Leone crafts an epic Western set against the backdrop of the Civil War, with some nice commentary on the futility of battle and treatment of POW's.  It doesn't slouch on the action, with some of the most iconic shootouts in film history (the final standoff remains one of the most iconic of all time).  Of course, it is matched perfectly by Ennio Morricone's brilliant score.  All in all, one of the finest westerns ever.",

Furthermore, several events were predictable, the main characters wouldn't have survived their walks in that heat, and several enemies had stormtrooper aim syndrome. However, the two main characters were well written and excellently acted. The cinematography and visual effects were impressive, the sets/props/costumes looked good, and the soundtrack is iconic, although it was a bit repetitive and poorly cut at times.",

The Good, The Bad and the Ugly has so much good about it, and quintessentially it is one of the best westerns ever made. There may be nothing new about the story at first glance, but that's the point, Leone is paying homage to the Hollywood western, and despite the initial simplicity there is also a complexity mainly in the film's characters. Regardless of whether simple or complex it is, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly does have a compelling and brilliantly written story.\n\nBut there are other assets that make The Good, The Bad and the Ugly so good. The dialogue is always excellent, while Leone's direction is superb once again. The characters are great and are superbly played. Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever here, and Eli Wallach is perfectly cast and more than a match for him. I was also very impressed with Lee Van Cleef, who I recognised from High Noon and such, but he makes a bigger impression here. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is also the most violent of the trilogy, and one of the most violent of the genre, not a bad thing whatsoever.\n\nThe pace was spot on too, even though the film is nearly three hours long, it is never boring or dull. The best things though about The Good, The Bad and the Ugly are the visuals and Ennio Morricone's score. The film looks amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous and the sweeping images and scenery are very lovingly crafted. Morricone's score is even more impressive than that, it is simply one of the best film scores I've ever heard, and if I had to say which was Morricone's best score, I would immediately say this.\n\nOverall, there is nothing bad or ugly about the film. The film is amazing. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Any cons noted are relative.\n\nI just feel like it's a drop-off from the brilliant double of 'A Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a Few Dollars More'. The near 3hr run time is one of the reasons, though the pacing is actually pretty good in fairness. I guess it's more so the plot, which is filled with an American Civil War setting which I didn't feel matched the characters.\n\nThe man in the middle/bounty hunting aspects of the original two films are perfect for the characters of Clint Eastwood & Co., whereas them tagging along for the war just felt odd; the story didn't feel as raw or volatile to me.\n\nAs stated, it's still - on its own merits - an entertaining western. Eastwood remains quality, while Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are extremely worthy onscreen counterparts. I will say Van Cleef feels forgotten about, probably just by me, towards the end until he magically reappears. Still, as a trio they are really enjoyable. The plot away from the war is properly fun, much more in keeping to what I was expecting. The score is also awesome, yet again.\n\nMinus the ACW and a shorter run time and I'd probably be classing this as great as AFOD and FAFDM. It's still very good though, which I evidently want to stress, and I'd definitely revisit it.\n\nwatched: \"Extended English-language version\".\nEven though this version is the same as the original Italian release (177 minutes), but seemingly the US shortened run time is considered the true incarnation?

In a related issue, this movie can't decide if it's an action-packed epic Western or a stirring anti-war polemic, so it tries to do both and in so doing fails at being either. The entire bridge battle at the end is completely unnecessary to the plot and only serves to deliver a \"WAR IS BAD\" message.

However, this is Italian film making at it's best, and beside making school for a whole new genre, thematically, cinematographically, in cast and acting, and not to forget musically - and even if Leone's films somehow went beyond true historical issues and events - they also paved way for realism in westerns from late 1960's on. Although they were not Spaghetti westerns, many of the stylistic elements also paved a basic road for films like Solider Blue, Little Big Man and series like Centennial. Many have tried, but it's hard if not impossible to level the quality of Leone's masterpieces. It has been ever since and probably always will be. With The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, together with Once Upon a Time in the West it culminated into an absolute form of art of its own. Timeless, unique and simply the best.",

Set in the American West during the Civil War's New Mexico Campaign of 1862, Sergio Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni were able to take their protagonists through a variety of plot lines only possible in that era, and this setting greatly enhances the overall tale of \"three rogues who are looking for some treasure\".  While there's a bit of anachronism (Blondie's rifle used at the end is a Sharps 1874) most of the sets and costumes are spot on.  And while it's absolutely popcorn fare, Leone has included several effective anti-war statements that give the film a little heart as well.  \"There are two kinds of people in this world, my friend...\"",

La nature épisodique du film perd de sa force et les 3 heures peuvent parfois sembler longues entre deux péripéties.

Le choix de centrer le film autour d'Eli Wallach, exceptionnel, est clairement l'idée de génie du script, créant alors un personnage inoubliable au milieu d'archétypes quasi parodiques.

The movie is mostly about three men with different personalities trying to use each other to find an ultimate treasure.\n\nThis movie was stationed at the end of the civil war after the Union had won, the year was most likely in 1865. This is a movie that is somewhat slow but tries to implement morals into a western but I felt like it ultimately failed at that. The main Characters are The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, and they repeat their actions of their character to a tee, except the Good one doesn't always seem good he just seems to be smarter than the other two main characters.\n\nI felt like the acting was okay, but both the villains were good actors especially the person that played the Bad character. It is hard to make a bad guy seem evil without being cheesy and that is what he does. \n\nI really liked it when the comrades teamed up to \"join the union\" because it showed how useless some of the fighting was in the civil war. I loved that they used their capabilities for good even if it was for their selfish needs, they saved lives theoretically. \n\nA group of people that would like this movie is people who enjoy slow adventure types of movies. I would not recommend any child under the age of 13 or 14 to watch this movie due to the amount of gore, violence, and death there is in this film that is so vividly shown. You need to have a lot of time on your hands to watch this film as well since it is 3 hours long. I would recommend watching it on a platform where you can skip otherwise you will be watching this film for a very long time due to long standoff moments filled with awkward music and staredowns that are unessential to the storyline. \n\nUltimately, I would not watch this movie again, but if you are completely bored then I would say go for it.",

            "content": "Few films have influenced their respective genre as much as this classic spaghetti western which not only launched Clint Eastwood's career but also a whole string of imitators. The iconic musical score, the close ups and the unique blend of comedy and serious philosophical discussion have been discussed to death but this is a better film than your average western. Even I, who typically do not enjoy the genre, can admire and enjoy this film as it is more than just a collection of tropes thrown together. The film succeeds for so many reasons but it's charm lies in how rough it sometimes becomes as the dubbing is ridiculously bad and the budget was clearly stretched thin in some places and yet the talent shines through.\n\nThe Man With No Name, Clint Eastwood, is partnered with Tuco, Eli Wallach, in a scheme that allows them to earn money from having Tuco arrested in various different towns and then saved from execution by his supposed captor. They become involved in the search for a grave described by mercenary ‘Bill Carson' where $200,000 is buried. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery but The Man knows the name on the gravestone and the two must stay together in order to find the money. Meanwhile the villainous Angel Eyes, Lee Van Cleef, also wants to find the money and is able to go undercover as a Union sergeant where he encounters the other two men who have been captured after a comical misunderstanding. The Man and Angel Eyes team up while abandoning Tuco but Tuco is able to go free and later resumes his partnership with The Man who chooses to take down Angel Eyes' gang. When trying to reach the cemetery they are stopped by Union Troops but after blowing up a bridge they reach the cemetery, each armed with valuable information, and a truel occurs in which Angel Eyes faces off against the two other men. \n\nThe opening scenes set up the characters so perfectly as even with the slightly cheesy credits for each character we get entertaining little vignettes that tell us exactly who these men are and set up the bleak tone that the film will adopt. The Ugly is crafty and intelligent while also being slightly over confident and Wallach, despite being American, pulls off the cartoony Italian accent and nervy goofiness well. Yet it is our villain's introduction that stays with us the longest as we know that while he is ruthless and cold blooded he has a strong set of principles that he stands by which will cause him to hunt down one man with all of his might. The introduction of the ‘good' also sets up the cruel irony of the film as the man who is supposedly the most moral of the three commits terrible wrongs all of the time and is driven almost entirely by his desire for money. Director Sergio Leone had a very clear vision of what this story was going to look like and his ability to provide us with three distinct, fascinating characters impresses immediately. \n\nThe score itself is worthy of a several page long essay but of all the great work that Ennio Morricone produced this may just be his masterpiece. The recurring motif of the theme being played after particularly dramatic moments works largely because the theme is so memorable but in lesser films this amount of repetition would tend to grate on my nerves. When people think of this film it is intrinsically connected to the music that plays over most of the running time and I know that I will always imagine the main theme in connection to the many close up shots of Wallach's beady little eyes.\n\nAs an adventure epic the film also works as at nearly three hours long we expect a great payoff and nobody could accuse the final showdown of being disappointing. We end on a note just as dark as the rest of the film but we appreciate the detailed portrait that Leone gives of his old west. Fans of the genre surely love the film for all of these reasons and more, that only a passionate lover of the genre could understand, but I found so much to delight in as I rarely do with a film of this sort.",

If done right this could have been the best western ever made. Or maybe the best movie ever made. However they focused too much on the civil war than they did the Wild West aspect of the film. The Man With No Name had like no screen time; the entire movie was a \"Tuco fest\". And on the subject of Tuco, I hated him. He was despicable and it drives me crazy he is the only character of the trilogy to fuck up the Man With No Name and get away with it. I mean I know The Man With No Name comes out on top at the end but it wasn't satisfying enough. The whole movie he was basically Tuco's hostage and was pushed around by him. I hated that, it put a huge dent in his awesome Statius. Not to mention I hated how he only wore the iconic Poncho for the last fifteen minutes. I know it's a prequel but his character is not complete without the costume. I would have liked to seen him wear it more. Also it lacked action. The first two movies were full of awesome gun fights and bad ass shoot outs. There weren't enough of that in this movie. Another thing I hate about this movie was there was no Villain. The Bad was a great character and I hate how he was only in the movie for like 10 minutes but he only fired his gun twice and killed 3 people. Not to mention he only fought the other characters once and their paths barley crossed. If you ask me a guy who's in a 3 hour Movie for ten minutes and contributes nothing to the action or opposition of the hero is so NOT THE VILLAIN. If The Man With No Name beat up Tuco at the end or had more Screen time and did more action sequences this would have been great. Also if the civil war subplot was focused on less that would have made the movie ten times better. Lastly the movies is about a quest across the wild west to find gold. If the quest aspect of the film had more attention it would be epic. Like more of a journey and build up to finding the treasure,It would be better. it wasn't a bad movie it was just very disappointing. ",

            "content": "An ambitious Western of style and substance.\n\nSergio Leone's Western epic The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly (1966) is a fascinating odyssey through America during The Civil War. Director Sergio Leone brings dozens of close-up shots of eyes and far wide shots of desert alike in his highly ambitious Western epic filled with hundreds of extras and cannon blasts. The gunfire is as riveting as his witty script brimming with creative solutions of traps his characters find themselves in as well as earnest character reveals.\n\nLeone's direction was never as sublime as his work during the movie's finale in the graveyard. All the engrossing journey of The Man with No Name Trilogy's franchise leads up to this point. Tuco is shot running with anticipating glee, so much so that Wallach is nearly skipping as he sprints around the graves. Leone's direction is full of detail. First off, Tuco is established earlier as not being able to read very well, so he cannot read the headstone's names, so Leone shoots this sequence with a disorienting blur of motion. Tuco is focused at all times, but the graves all blur past at increasingly fast speed. It's a holy experience hearing Ennio Morricone's The Ecstasy of Gold soar past as Tuco seeks the one grave that will make his life rich forever. I got teary eyed the first time I saw The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly (1966) during this wonderful scene.\n\nThe Mexican standoff at the end of The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly is lovely as it's filmed with a wide shot of the entire circular graveyard center, but Leone uses close-ups of eyes and hands to build tremendous tension before any bullets are fired. Leone's choice of ending also establishes that Angel Eyes needed to die as the most murderous and evil character. Thus, Clint Eastwood had to be the one to shoot him as \"The Good.\" Leone even leaves you laughing as Tuco's gun appears to jam at first, then Tuco reveals Eastwood emptied Tuco's bullets the night before. So, Eastwood's acting during the standoff is not like Van Cleef or Wallach, who have to depict nervous men that are deciding who to shoot. Eastwood's hero already knows he must shoot Angel Eyes as he's a real threat and the man that might kill him or shoot his friend Tuco.\n\nThe jokes are hilarious within this film mostly because we often follow Eli Wallach's Mexican bandit Tuco as he bumbles and shoots his way to gold. Wallach plays \"The Ugly\" with all his soul as he pleads for compassion from his monk brother, then scorning him for his wrath. He gives The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly a grisly grit and unpredictable feel at all times. His rapport with Clint Eastwood's nameless hero is so funny as they try to double cross and murder each other constantly. Wallach stumbles around, fires off rounds and jeers at the world with reckless abandon as Tuco in his dirty jacket and muddy hands. Wallach was perfect as the memorable con man and robber.\n\nEastwood is as quiet and cool as the man with no name. His grave facial expressions reveal his character's thoughts without a word needing to be said. When he does speak it's with a forlorn wisdom and regret for all the lives lost around him or an incredibly witty remark usually at the expense of Tuco. Eastwood truly embodies what a Western hero should be as \"The Good\" part of the film's equation. He seeks the money for his own use, but on the way he blows up a bridge for a Union Captain and comforts a dying Confederate soldier alike. Eastwood takes out criminal after criminal with his killer quick draw gunslinging that's as awesome to watch as he ever was on screen.\n\nLee Van Cleef's villain Angel Eyes is fearsome slapping women, torturing men, gunning down families, and deceiving the Union Army. He is the most depraved gentlemen antagonist this film could have hoped for as \"The Bad.\" His glares of hatred and smirks of knowing glee are chilling to behold. Lee Van Cleef was an amazing acting talent that he could stand next to Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach in their prime and still be engaging and mysterious.\n\nIn all, Sergio Leone was a master of the Western film genre and The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly demonstrates why. Cool shootouts, riveting storytelling, intriguing historical context, and outstanding acting from the 3 leads. Ennio Morricone's legendary score is just a genius icing the already masterfully crafted cake that is The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly.",

The look of the film is like watching your favourite pieces of art come to life. The characters are great and enjoyable to watch. Personly my favourite character was Tuco played by Eli Wallach he is the character who is not bad but not good but more of an ugly. The action in this movie is filmed so well and feels real unlike a lot of other movies, and has one of the most intense duels ever. This film also has some of the greatest music for any sound track ever conducted by Ennio Morricone. The music fits the scenes perfectly and makes you feel like your in a western.

Sergio Leone's masterpiece is an unquestionable landmark in the history of Cinema, and one of the most influencial movies of all time. \n\nThe acting is nearly flawless, thanks not only to good dialogue, but also to the fantastic trio of Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach (who absolutely steals the show for the majority of the movie), who share a wicked chemistry with each other, and fit their respective roles like a tailored suit - Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, a delightfuly evil bounty hunter, Wallach as Tuco, a vicious, sleazy and despicable criminal who is the perfect match to Eastwood's \"Man with no Name\", one of (if not THE) most recognizable and loved characters of all time - a silent but charismatic, violent but fair, cruel... but somehow, good. \n\nThe plot is simple but extremely efficient. Never does anything feel out of place, and all the events seem credible. The 3 characters have clear motives and personalities, while the dialogues, as mentioned before, are a highlight. The cinematography is breath-taking, and the score (as well as its use in the movie) is nothing short of legendary, at this point.\n\nThe only detail that doesn't quite match the story arch is the bridge battle, but even that serves as a way to develop even more Eastwood's and Wallach's characters, so that can be considered an insignificant flaw (but a very entertaining one, nonetheless).\n\nOverall, the best movie out of the \"Dollars Trilogy\" is still a thrilling, ambitious and memorable as it has ever been, and it stands as one of Cinema's great masterpieces.",

This movie is like that guilty pleasure of eating a shameful portion of your favorite snack food. Everything about this movie is dripping with the best parts of an unbelievable action western. \n\nThe performances are strong. This is a great comfort space for Clint Eastwood; the cards close to his chest bad-ass. Eli Wallach is the real star here, playing a difficult character alongside a master in the genre. He plays a goofy chatterbox, but he never relents his menacing edge, and makes for a formidable foil.  The long pan shots across the harsh open west are masterful. The score is overbearing at every turn, which fits this movie perfectly. I think one thing that Sergio Leone was particularly good at is creating a series of self-contained scenes that live and breathe on their own terms. This helps mitigate the indulgent length of the movie. Most of the movie is a play on tense moments and extremely drawn out close-ups and build-up. The famous stand-off at the end pushes this into the absurd. \n\nThis movie should not work, most imitators fail to hit this formula correctly, but The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is the gold standard for epic, operatic westerns. If you need any other reason to watch this, you can also see where Quentin Tarantino gets some of his inspiration.",

Briefly,  'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' is a phenomenal piece of cinema, sharply written, sharply filmed, made of remarkable scenes where Leone superbly alternates endless landscapes and close-ups, silence and sound.

The use of wide shot is phenomenal, cuts backs and forth, minimal dialogue, Ennio Morricone's score is truly one that continues to attract audiences throughout the film, and extreme close-up as a characterization of the three major characters in this film. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is just a 30-minute film. It's filled with a variety of plots, not just focusing on the gold or the treasure. The Civil War scene is actually great with the cinematography and real explosions. It conveyed some satire to such a scene. The Civil War became one of the themes of this film.

            "content": "cinegeek.de Our Daily Free Stream: Sergio Leone - The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. Eine gewaltige Leere, so eröffnet sich die Landschaft vor uns. Ganz langsam kreist die Kamera, hält schliesslich inne auf einem sonnenverbrannten, verzweifelten Gesicht. Aus dem langen Shot wird ein Close-Up ohne Schnitt. Die Landschaft war nicht gänzlich verlassen, sondern besetzt durch einen Desperado. Mit dieser ersten Szene eröffnet uns Sergio Leone seine Technik und die wird er beibehalten: Unser Blick ist begrenzt durch den Bildrand. Was ausserhalb geschieht; wir wissen es nicht. Die grössten Momente in The Good, The Bad And The Ugly funktionieren so: Wir sehen es nicht, die Protagonisten auch nicht. Wir alle werden überrascht! Ob das, was geschieht, plausbel ist, kümmert Leone nicht. Er baut sein Meisterwerk auf den Trümmern der Klischees des Westerns auf. Aus Dreck wird hier Kunst hergestellt! Jeder liebt diesen Film - nur warum eigentlich? In den späten 60ern mochte man wohl noch vom Spaghetti Western sprechen, heute vergleicht man Leone mit der klassischen Oper. Dabei vergisst man, mit welch geringen Mitteln er prooduzierte: Clint Eastwood, ein Hollywood Schauspieler der zweiten Reihe, aus dem Fernsehen. Dialoge mutete man ihm kaum zu und so wirkt das Werk fast wie ein Stummfilm - aufgefüllt durch Musik und Effekten. Leone und sein Team versuchten mit grosser Anstrengung, \"amerikanisch\" zu wirken. Ennio Morricone scheint das mit seinem Soundtrack zu betonen und doch ist kein Hollywood Western so musikalisch (Leone selbst war für mich ironischer Weise von den deutschen Western der frühen 60ern viel mehr beeinflusst). Eastwoods Figur, ein Mann ohne Namen. Im ersten Teil nannte man ihn Joe, dann Manco, diesmal Blondie. Irgendetwas sorgt dafür, dass Leones Western wie aus einem anderen Universum kommt. Auf keinen Fall aus Hollywood. Die Darsteller, auch sie wirken fernab von einem Hollywood Cast und müssen wohl in Spanien aufgetrieben worden sein, dort wo der Dreh stattfand. Ihre Gesichter, zerfurcht von Arbeit und der Sonne. Leones Wüste, man sah sie nie zuvor im Western! Seine Filme wirken wie überhöhte Träume; grösser, brutaler, dramatischer als das Leben! Leone erzählt seine Geschichte in Bildern, nicht mit Worten. Nehmen wir die grandiose Sequenz auf dem Friedhof! In einem der Gräber ist ein Schatz versenkt. Clint Eastwood (the Good), Lee Van Cleef (the Bad), und der tolle Eli Wallach (the Ugly); sie alle sind bewaffnet und suchen. Wenn ein Mann schiesst, werden alle sterben. Leone filmt das in einer Einstellung, wir sehen die Waffen, ihre Gesichter, ihre Augen, Schweiss und Fliegen. Immer flirtet Leone mit der Parodie und auch das gehört zu seinem Stil. The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, das ist keine \"Story\", das sind grosse, ja groteske Gesten! Nehmen wir Clint Eastwood, der damals ein TV Star war. Wer würde für jemanden zahlen, den man auch umsonst bekam? Dennoch ergriff er seine Chance, Kinofilme zu machen! Das ging für Eastwood nur ausserhalb Hollywoods. Seine Figur spricht etwa ein Zehntel gegenüber Eli Wallachs Tuco. Der Mann ohne Namen spricht nie, Tuco hört nie auf zu quatschen. Doch was für eine Autorität verleiht Eastwood dieser Figur! Parodie? Immer nahe dran. Wallach, damals ein Hollywood Veteran, nimmt seine unterbezahlte Arbeit ernst und schafft einen unvergesslichen Charakter: Genauso lächerlich wie verzweifelt. Tuco sucht nach Freundschaft, ist aber zu verschlagen und nicht vertrauenswürdig, um eine Freundschaft einzugehen. Er ist es nicht Wert. Tuco kann einfach nicht aus seiner Haut! Auch Lee Van Cleef kennt man aus Hollywood Western, wobei er immer nur Nebendarsteller blieb. In diesem Western, in dem alle mit zusammen gekniffenen Augen herumrennen, ist er derjenige, mit den gemeinsten Augenschlitzen! Die drei Männer suchen einen Schatz, mitten im amerikanischen Civil War. Jeder der Drei besitzt aber nur eine Teilinformation. Deshalb müssen sie so lange zusammen bleiben (und am Leben) bis der Schatz geborgen ist. Überraschenderweise nimmt Leone seinen Hintergrund des Bürgerkriegs so ernst, dass wir fast einen Film-im-Film geboten kriegen über eine ausgedehnte Schlacht. Leones Visionen - grenzenlos! Er machte aus dem Italo Western sein eigenes, erhöhtes Genre! Wie gross er war, dass sehen wir vor allem in den Uncut Versionen, die ihr in unserer Filmkunstbar Fitzcarraldo im Keller leihen könnt. Im Autoren-Regal unter Sergio Leone. Bitte lasst keinen Film aus! (Wir stellen nicht den Film, nur den link zur Verfügung)",

And even though the story meanders a bit, nearly three hours in length, it is still a captivating story of what is good, bad, and ugly in all of us. Some may say the film is unnecessarily brutal, but it's a reflection of one of the most brutal times in American history, the Civil War where more death and carnage occurred than any time previous or since. Clint Eastwood is his usual cool, cold self, but it is Eli Wallach who steals the show. His character, Tuco, has got to be one of the most selfish, mean, nasty, evil men in film history. Yet at the same time, he's so silly, so pathetic, so idiotic, you can't but find a place in your heart for this villain. And whether Blondie is Good, Blue Eyes Evil, and Tuco Ugly is questionable. They're all about as evil as can be, so maybe Blondie is only good comparatively. The relationship between Blondie and Tuco is an odd one, to say the least. It is one that is mutually beneficially and mutually abusive, yet at the same time they appear to seek it out. In the end, the bad guy gets it, but even though good and ugly escape with a fortune, the only reason they both escape is the perverse connection they've built over time. Moral of the story? Well, there really is none. It's just good, clean, masochistic, shoot 'em up, evil and mayhem with a very little taste of the good thrown in for, as one would say, good measure.",

Yes, it wasn't horrifically violent, though I did close my eyes since I wasn't sure where a scene was going to go in its violence.  I just found the whole movie plodding along, while you have to figure out who's doing what to whom and how are they going to do it.  I also hated the constant over-the-top close-ups that the director kept using.  The whole movie was too long for the eventually-figured-out plot.  So, now I can say that I've seen it.  I just can't figure out why so many people loved this film.

It was nice to see an old school western from old Hollywood, shoot outs were great, a lot of great performances here but the story is a bit strange, the good character left my head scratching as to the way he deals with the ugly character, if I knew the guy in front of me was going to come after me for revenge in old west I probably wouldn't have dealt with it the way he did but I guess that wouldn't have made for a good movie. 3hrs I like a film that's good that has a 3hr length, If I had paid to see this movie (saw it on Amazon Prime) it would have been worth every penny. Short films tend to suck.",

Potentially it could have been wonderful, a cat and mouse game involving 3 men, all seeking a hidden treasure in a war-torn country while coming across many memorable conflicts along the way. Some scenes are very remarkable, particularly the now legendary Mexican standoff at the climax, a masterwork of camera positioning, timing, tension and the trio of varying facial expressions, it's by far the greatest moment in the entire flick. The thing that lets the movie down most is its pacing. At times it is unforgivably slow, and rather than heightening any kind of suspense or atmosphere it just pads the runtime, as do several completely unnecessary scenes that are almost self-aware in their padding ability. We see far too little of the 'Bad' character, spending most of it with the 'Ugly', an individual who swings sporadically between put-upon victim and obnoxious comic relief. The musical score is, admittedly, fantastic, and Clint Eastwood is entertaining as the 'Good', but often understates his performance to the point that he may as well be replaced with a mannequin. The end comes about an hour too late, and when it finally arrives you'll be forced to ask yourself if you've just wasted your time completely. For me, the answer was a regrettable 'yes.'",

In some ways I enjoyed the two earlier films more as they seem more purely spaghetti westerns, relying more on mood and less on a storyline. This film has a more likely story, and much more patos as it involves the horrors of war, but at the same time this makes it more like an ordinary action/western movie.

Opening in such a fashion only adds to the awe-inspiring, revered grandeur of this final installment in the \"Dollars\" trilogy.  After two low-budget Spaghetti Westerns, Leone is finally given a non-restrictive freedom with his $1.2 million dollar budget. Apart from it's two predecessors, GBU (as we'll abbreviate it) undergoes a genre different than Fistful and Few Dollars' Spaghetti Western genre. It is that of the epic Spaghetti Western.  With a new setting taking it's place in the Civil War, Ennio Morricone's provocative, bombastic score; Sergio Leone's newly given budgetary freedom and his usual in-your-face stylistic aesthetic; epic is an understatement for \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\".  GBU is worthy of it's excessive mainstream references.  But enough with the laudation and praise.  Like it's predecessors and Westerns in general, GBU is most notable when it comes to it's exciting, explosive, mature and continually evolving plot.  Again, Sergio, now with a bigger budget, is given more freedom with his next installment and was able to construct a much more exciting plot revolving around the Civil War.  As unsympathetic as it is, the Civil War is simply an obstacle in the way of our two companions \"Blondie\" (Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (Eli Wallach).  But this is because we're seeing this story in a closed perspective--it's a Western epic, not a war epic.  But Leone subtly uses the Civil War to tell small things about our characters.  Unexpectedly, we are shown glimpses into Eastwood's character now nicknamed, \"Blondie\", and even his competing partner, Tuco.  Who would've known that \"The Man With No Name\" would actually be more than just a generic anti-hero in the wild, wild west.  Clint Eastwood reprises his subtle performance, but is given much more to do here.  Unconventionally, we are given two antagonist--a major and minor.  Both are worthy for the grandeur of the film--though, at one small interval, the film seems to get a little too wrapped up in it's grandeur.  Even with all the enhanced visuals, battles, exploding bridges, and shootouts; Ennio Morricone's bombastic score not only complements the grandiosity, but gives the film it's entirety of it.  Nothing is left unimproved with Sergio's bigger budget.  Lee Van Cleef returns, playing a different character than in Few Dollars. Eli Wallach has offered a unique antagonist in the \"trilogy\"--he is greedy, vulnerable, and at times dim-witted. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is certainly the best of the Spaghetti Westerns and arguably the best of the Westerns.",

It kept the movie constantly going in action/adventure as they went to a different location reminding me of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Blondie Tuco and Angel Eyes performed by their actors is amazing. The cleverness shootouts and memorable dialogue all work perfectly. That Mexican Standoff was insane. Surprisingly the comedy was interesting Tuco was in some ways used for comic relief (especially during the desert scene). Strong emotional moments made you feel apart of that era of the Wild West. The Build Up, tension, emotional moments that sort of unease that you know they're gonna kill each other but you still wanna watch. And watch i shall as it is beautifully shot. Serge Leon ingeniously infused it as a war film as the movie takes place during the Wild West campaign of the Civil War. It shows a decent bridge battle scene, anti war moments like the prisoners, the mass graves and bodies of the dead soldiers. The score is fantastic: groundbreaking & epic, it is the journey of 3 anti heroes and their race to gold during the Civil War. To incorporate a war film into a Spaghetti Western was daring and ingenious which separates it from other westerns thus Making  the Good, Bad, and Ugly the best western film ever made as well as one of the best films ever made. This film is damn flawless.",

Clint Eastwood is terrific, but \"Tuco\" and \"The Bad\" are both fascinating as well. A bit tighter editing could have done this film better, but its good bits (the graveyard in particular) are so good, and the score by Ennio Morricone so enrapturing, that the film can't be dragged down too much by a few dull scenes here and there.

The story goes on and on with fine performances and the most notable one from Eli Wallach especially in the ending. The story is basically about the show off between The Good and The Ugly where The Bad although doesn't have much of a role is seen here and there. The opening scene with The Bad is so good that it inspired many including QT for Inglorious Basterds. My favourite western is 3:10 to Yuma and I will add The Good, The Bad and The Ugly to it.",

The acting and performances were superb, but none were better than Clint Eastwood's legendary performance as the \"Man with No Name\". That being said, all the characters were brilliant, and each of them helps to hammer home this film's depiction of the lawless Old West. The film's greatest strength is its style and overall presentation. The film's theme song recurs as a leitmotif throughout the whole film, and this creates a unique atmosphere that cements this movie's iconic status. The iconic soundtrack and the film's amazing visuals are among the key things that make this movie stand out from other westerns. The director obviously wanted to portray the Old West as a world of violence and fear, and he obviously succeeded with the well choreographed and stylish shoot-outs, and the ending was one of the best endings I've seen. Overall, many people give this film an iconic status, and in all honesty, this movie deserves it.

It is very obvious that Sergio Leone had a bigger budget for this film because it is bigger, longer, and a lot of the images are more crisp and clear. However this might be my least favorite of the three. I don't think the length of the film works in its favor. There are several moments where I felt like the characters were getting sidetracked on some tangential story that was irrelevant to the central treasure-hunt plot and should have been edited out of the movie. It literally took about an hour or more before the 3 titular characters even met up and all shared the same goal. Personally I'd probably eliminate most of the involvement in the Civil War, because it doesn't seem to connect well with the rest of the movie. I'm not saying that The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is a bad film, I merely liked the others a bit more.\n\nWhat really worked great for me in this movie was Eli Wallach. His performance as Tuco (the \"Ugly\") was so engaging. At one moment you love him, then the next moment you hate him, and then the next moment he has you laughing until your sides hurt. This is a new type of character to these films, and I like how I never really know how to feel about him. Clint Eastwood's role as Blondie felt a little muddled in this film, not by any fault of Eastwood, but as a symptom of the script. In the Few Dollars films I understood his motivations and was able to connect with his character. Yet in this film, where he's labelled \"The Good,\" I felt it was very difficult to nail down if he was truly good. There are moments where he is mean, greedy, vindictive, and downright cruel. That hurt my perception of his character. I did not have the same problem with Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes. He lived up to his moniker as \"The Bad\" in almost every scene. He wasn't pure evil like you might expect from some villains, but he was cruel enough to fit the name.\n\nMost of the hallmarks of Leone's films work great here as usual. His showdowns are intense and really build suspense in the viewer right up until the moment a gun is drawn. Ennio Morricone's score is so inventive and this music is truly iconic. That whistled line in the score is one of the most memorable movie themes ever written, and even people who've never seen this movie are instantly transported into an old west mindset once they hear it. I didn't even notice the dubbing as much here (probably because all three leads are Americans.) I enjoyed this film quite a bit, and will probably watch it again from time to time. I was impacted a bit more by the first 2 films in the \"trilogy,\" but this one is still quite solid.\n\n(On a side note: Who came up with the whole \"Man with No Name\" title for this trilogy? Eastwood is called by a name in all 3 films!)",

It seems deeper & smoother than the other two, like a masterwork fine-tuned from the greatness of the previous two films.\nThough this technically takes place before the first two, Eastwood is more mature as Blondie.  There is more range and depth in the character, who's wiser and more aware of what's at stake.\nLee Van Cleef is perfectly sinister as Angel Eyes, the other side of the coin from when we saw him in For a Few Dollars More.  Yet, as \"bad\" guys go, Angel Eyes has a sense of honor during his pursuit.  He's the villain you hate to love.  Eli Wallach's Tuco is the villain you hate to love.  But he's the pivot upon which this movie swings.  Tuco gets all the best lines.  So many great ones, many which should be imprinted into our subconsciousness with other lines like \"Use the Force\" and \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.\" \nTuco's voracious greed drives the plot, taking us on a wild ride through a Civil War conflict in the Old West.  His quest, along with Blondie & Angel Eyes, reminds me of the trippy surrealism of Apocalypse Now.  And like the other \"Dollars\" films, this one is based mostly on being as darkly badass as it can be.\nI also loved the soundtrack in this movie.  The music is much better than the first two, even though that main song, the one we all think of when we think of awesome Western moments, plays obsessively throughout.  But it's hard to resist how effective the score is for the movie.\nReally, this should be in anyone's film collection, even despite being almost 3 hours long.",

            "content": "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the final film of Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy. This film is recognized by most as the best film from the trilogy, some argue that it's Leone's best film overall. I, on the other hand, found this film great but it did have it's flaws. I also cannot say this film is the filmmaker's best as I found this film to be equally as good as For A Few Dollars More.\n\nThis film was mainly written by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both also collaborated in writing the previous film. I'll start by saying the great things about the film's screenplay. The film is huge in comparison to the previous film and even more when you compare to the A Fistful of Dollars. The film almost feels like an epic film like Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur, which I liked. It makes the film stand out from the other western at it's time. The best part of the film in my opinion are the characters as Leone and Vincenzoni have created people that are very focused on their goal, but at the same time keeping them interesting by adding personality with these characters which clearly defines them. Though I do wish that Lee Van Cleef's character was written more screen time to allow us to understand more about the character, which Leone did incredibly well for Gian Maria Volonte in For A Few Dollars More. The film's story covers the civil war in America but it doesn't become a focused aspect as the film focuses on the characters and the end goal which was great. The film's title is ironic because each one of the main characters are just as ugly as the other one, being driven by greed and will do whatever they can to get the gold, even if breaks the partnership between characters. The bad part, nothing ugly, about the film's story is the middle part of the film which at times can become a bit too draggy and doesn't keep me on my toes as it does on Leone's previous films. That is just a minor nitpick as it's still tolerable and it only affects me a few times during my many viewings of the film. There was a particular moment in the end of the film which I wasn't sure why Eastwood's character did it, was Blondie trying to prove a point that he still can shoot a rope or that he just wanted to get back at Tuco for what he did to him.\n\nLeone's direction and vision for this film is much bigger and concrete. The man knew what he wanted to do for this film and since his other two films he has gained a major boost on his confidence. This made the film feel very patient, showing shots that take it's time in moving on to the next shot or scene. The scope of the film has drastically expanded, showing huge location shots with actors looking very miniature on screen, which at times juxtaposes with the extreme close ups that are also abundant of this film. I think Leone was influenced by David Lean, as moments feel like something that came off from Lawrence of Arabia or at least similarly. Leone is known for creating a memorable climax, and this one may be the most memorable one. The build up to the climax is worth the 2 and a half hour wait as it's so well done, building tension and keeping the audience anxious on what will happen.\n\nThe film's director of photography is Tonino Delli Colli who would then work with Leone later on his future films. I wished that Massimo Dallamano came back for this film, the previous film's cinematographer, as he has created a particular style that suited Leone's direction and vision, but Colli didn't do a bad job for this film as he still kept it like a western and increased the scope of Leone's previous films. His work here has definitely become iconic but personally I felt that his best work was Once Upon A Time In America. Leone and Colli's photography shines specifically on moments like the scene with the open desert and the graveyard climax.\n\nEnnio Morricone comes back for this film and is definitely his best work. Morricone's score here is much bigger in comparison to his previous work. Morricone's score for this film is much more complex and diverse than his first film with Leone. Leone has created a particular melody and created three styles of delivering it, relating each to a character. Morricone's score stood out the most during the climax as it felt like a throwback to his previous score but interlacing it with his current score. A moment in the POW camp where the prisoners are playing music to drown out torture noises was a moment that showed so much emotion; this was achieved with great acting, beautiful photography, but mostly due to the music. This was the first time I felt that Leone can create something emotional and dramatic, which was not really present on his previous films. \n\nThe acting spotlight here is equally shared by Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood plays it darker in this film, due to his character being very driven to obtain that gold and will do whatever he can to ensure that he'll get it. At the same time, Eastwood is given moments in this film that showcases a humanitarian point of view, which I thought was a nice touch. Van Cleef's character was a little underused in this film as Wallach and Eastwood had a wider screen time, but when he comes on screen (like the introduction of the character) he plays it cool and at times a bit dark. Van Cleef definitely surprised me because I never really saw him as a villain due to his fantastic performance from his previous film. Eli Wallach was like breath of fresh air, his humor and style of acting really drove the film forward and kept the tone light. I definitely preferred him here rather than his work on The Magnificent Seven. Leone has brought back familiar faces from his previous films, kind of like a cameo and a treat for people who are fans of his work.\n\nThe Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a very well made film but it's minor flaws prevent it from being perfect. It currently ties with For A Few Dollars More but this is just my opinion of the film at the time of writing. I may end up loving this film a lot more as I grow older and with repeated watching. The film has definitely stood the test of time and remain feeling like a fresh and unique in comparison to the many Western films of that era.",

Of course, I later realized that the westerns made of pure gunfight are the worst. That's why The Good, The Bad and the Ugly isn't pure guns, there's also some characterization, story-telling and entertainment. Maybe I need some time to actually re-evaluate it correctly, but so far, I think is very solid, but not entirely perfect or near it.\r\n\r\nI didn't find the story as \"compelling\", but it was well developed. It's mostly character-driven, and, in today fashion, we can say it plays like an RPG: characters go many other places, facing many dangers, escaping, getting caught, escaping again and getting separated and reunited over and over, all before reaching the location they're supposed to be in the first place. It's fun. The performances are great, as expected. Pacing can be a problem but not in the level of The Hobbit. Overall it's a great movie, but I don't think it's that perfect. The Bad stays out of the movie for large periods, and I don't know what was going on most of the time, it constantly changes tone and objectives. It's hard to stay tuned, thus it affect the experience. Not that I think it's overrated, but I have seen better westerns, like The Magnificent Seven, which isn't an \"spaghetti\", but surely it's a western.\r\n\r\nMaybe i need to see more westerns, but in the meantime, this third movie in the \"Dollars Trilogy\" is a classic every movie-goer should know, it has great characters, great story-telling, great crafting and the classic score by Morricone. An entertaining and epic western.\r\n\r\nI stay with the rope.\r\n\r\nHAPPY HOLIDAYS REVIEWS PART 13: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)",

            "content": "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the final film of Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy. This film is recognized by most as the best film from the trilogy, some argue that it's Leone's best film overall. I, on the other hand, found this film great but it did have it's flaws. I also cannot say this film is the filmmaker's best as I found this film to be equally as good as For A Few Dollars More.\n\nThis film was mainly written by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both also collaborated in writing the previous film. I'll start by saying the great things about the film's screenplay. The film is huge in comparison to the previous film and even more when you compare to the A Fistful of Dollars. The film almost feels like an epic film like Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur, which I liked. It makes the film stand out from the other western at it's time. The best part of the film in my opinion are the characters as Leone and Vincenzoni have created people that are very focused on their goal, but at the same time keeping them interesting by adding personality with these characters which clearly defines them. Though I do wish that Lee Van Cleef's character was written more screen time to allow us to understand more about the character, which Leone did incredibly well for Gian Maria Volonte in For A Few Dollars More. The film's story covers the civil war in America but it doesn't become a focused aspect as the film focuses on the characters and the end goal which was great. The film's title is ironic because each one of the main characters are just as ugly as the other one, being driven by greed and will do whatever they can to get the gold, even if breaks the partnership between characters. The bad part, nothing ugly, about the film's story is the middle part of the film which at times can become a bit too draggy and doesn't keep me on my toes as it does on Leone's previous films. That is just a minor nitpick as it's still tolerable and it only affects me a few times during my many viewings of the film. There was a particular moment in the end of the film which I wasn't sure why Eastwood's character did it, was Blondie trying to prove a point that he still can shoot a rope or that he just wanted to get back at Tuco for what he did to him.\n\nLeone's direction and vision for this film is much bigger and concrete. The man knew what he wanted to do for this film and since his other two films he has gained a major boost on his confidence. This made the film feel very patient, showing shots that take it's time in moving on to the next shot or scene. The scope of the film has drastically expanded, showing huge location shots with actors looking very miniature on screen, which at times juxtaposes with the extreme close ups that are also abundant of this film. I think Leone was influenced by David Lean, as moments feel like something that came off from Lawrence of Arabia or at least similarly. Leone is known for creating a memorable climax, and this one may be the most memorable one. The build up to the climax is worth the 2 and a half hour wait as it's so well done, building tension and keeping the audience anxious on what will happen.\n\nThe film's director of photography is Tonino Delli Colli who would then work with Leone later on his future films. I wished that Massimo Dallamano came back for this film, the previous film's cinematographer, as he has created a particular style that suited Leone's direction and vision, but Colli didn't do a bad job for this film as he still kept it like a western and increased the scope of Leone's previous films. His work here has definitely become iconic but personally I felt that his best work was Once Upon A Time In America. Leone and Colli's photography shines specifically on moments like the scene with the open desert and the graveyard climax.\n\nEnnio Morricone comes back for this film and is definitely his best work. Morricone's score here is much bigger in comparison to his previous work. Morricone's score for this film is much more complex and diverse than his first film with Leone. Leone has created a particular melody and created three styles of delivering it, relating each to a character. Morricone's score stood out the most during the climax as it felt like a throwback to his previous score but interlacing it with his current score. A moment in the POW camp where the prisoners are playing music to drown out torture noises was a moment that showed so much emotion; this was achieved with great acting, beautiful photography, but mostly due to the music. This was the first time I felt that Leone can create something emotional and dramatic, which was not really present on his previous films. \n\nThe acting spotlight here is equally shared by Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood plays it darker in this film, due to his character being very driven to obtain that gold and will do whatever he can to ensure that he'll get it. At the same time, Eastwood is given moments in this film that showcases a humanitarian point of view, which I thought was a nice touch. Van Cleef's character was a little underused in this film as Wallach and Eastwood had a wider screen time, but when he comes on screen (like the introduction of the character) he plays it cool and at times a bit dark. Van Cleef definitely surprised me because I never really saw him as a villain due to his fantastic performance from his previous film. Eli Wallach was like breath of fresh air, his humor and style of acting really drove the film forward and kept the tone light. I definitely preferred him here rather than his work on The Magnificent Seven. Leone has brought back familiar faces from his previous films, kind of like a cameo and a treat for people who are fans of his work.\n\nThe Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a very well made film but it's minor flaws prevent it from being perfect. It currently ties with For A Few Dollars More but this is just my opinion of the film at the time of writing. I may end up loving this film a lot more as I grow older and with repeated watching. The film has definitely stood the test of time and remain feeling like a fresh and unique in comparison to the many Western films of that era.",

And then slowly, very slowly, I started to get bored. I began to realize that most of what was happening had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Side trip over this way, side trip over that way. for three freaking hours! Not every movie needs to be about plot. I get it. I was just so stinking bored. what's the point of a plot if you're not going to spend any time on it? And we kept making side trips into the civil war armies. ug. I don't care! Just get on with it!

            "content": "Em «O Bom, o Mau e o Vilão», o espectador depara-se com um filme que é muito mais complexo e profundo do que os dois anteriores volumes da saga, e que se eleva a um estado de quase-transcendentalidade que é muito raro um filme conquistar. Do muito pouco de Cinema que por agora eu já conheço, penso que «O Bom, o Mau e o Vilão» foi o único filme em muito tempo que me deixou, tanto durante o seu visionamento como após o mesmo, num estado perfeitamente hipnótico. Algo que já me tinha sucedido precisamente com mais alguns filmes, nomeadamente outras duas obras primas de Sergio Leone - «Era Uma Vez na América» e «Aconteceu no Oeste» -, e «O Bom, o Mau e o Vilão» trata-se, com certeza, de outro desses filmes magistrais e completamente inigualáveis, que mostram a versatilidade e o talento de um realizador que conseguia retratar no ecrã as mais diversas histórias a partir das formas mais peculiares e pouco usuais, mas que são efetivamente geniais.\n\n  \n\n«O Bom, o Mau e o Vilão» retoma as aventuras e desventuras do \"Homem Sem Nome\", o mais famoso pistoleiro dos westerns com um toque de raviolli, e que desta vez, apesar desse epíteto que os media norte-americanos atribuíram à personagem, é apelidado de \"Blondie\". O indivíduo e o ator que o interpreta, Clint Eastwood, adquirem uma nova dimensão nunca antes alcançada até então nas histórias dos Dólares, tornando esta personagem num verdadeiro herói, \"de carne e osso\", algo que os dois outros filmes já tinham trabalhado um pouco (mas não o suficiente, apesar de ter havido uma certa evolução de fita para fita), sem recorrer demasiado aos artifícios \"espetaculares\" das personagens dos filmes de ação que costumam aliciar a malta masculina em busca de testosterona cinematográfica («Rambo», «Os Mercenários» e afins...), em que os bons e os maus quase não têm sentimentos e se assemelham um pouco a robôs pré-programados. Regressa o ator Lee Van Cleef, que aqui interpreta outra personagem (\"Angel Eyes\") apesar de utilizar, praticamente, os mesmos acessórios de vestuário (e de armamento também) que o Coronel Mortimer que encarnou em «Por Mais Alguns Dólares». Neste capítulo final, Van Cleef perdeu toda a (pouca) simpatia da personagem anterior, sendo aqui um verdadeiro homicida sanguinário e impiedoso, que não olha a meios para atingir os seus fins. Temos aqui uma grande diferença entre o Bom e o Mau, com Eastwood a ser um \"Homem sem Nome\" mais humano sério, e de certo modo tocante, contra o odiável e desprezível Van Cleef. E o Vilão? Bem, efetivamente não se trata bem de um Vilão, visto que ele é Tuco (que na tradução original não seria o Vilão - porque efetivamente esse é Angel Eyes, se formos a ver bem pelas características e ações que a personagem nos mostra - , mas sim o Feio - algo que se adequa perfeitamente, basta olhar para a fuça do personagem), um fulano interpretado por Eli Wallach que, por vias do oportunismo ultra-excessivo e completamente propositado, tanto aproveita estar de um lado como do outro da moeda, mas acabando sempre por virar mais para a companhia de Blondie, mas... para ser ele a ficar com o ouro que os três personagens estão incessantemente à procura durante as quase três horas de duração (muito, mas muito bem passadas) de «O Bom, o Mau e o Vilão». Mas é interessante ver como Blondie e Tuco, acidentalmente, se vão aproximando um do outro, por causa da busca dos tais 200 000 dólares. Por momentos até julgamos que eles são bons amigos, mas... é provável que não sejam. É bom salientar também a vertente metaforico-filosófica de Tuco, o que o faz estar constantemente a debitar pseudo-frases marcantes da vida (como o exemplo que utilizei para abrir esta crítica), o que acaba por dar um interesse acrescido ao nível psicológico a esta personagem. As outras duas personagens também o são, mas Tuco tornou-se uma verdadeira surpresa nesse aspecto. \n\n\n\nÉ interessante também analisar ao pormenor o crescimento da personagem de Clint Eastwood ao longo de toda a trilogia e o porquê de isso se ter sucedido. É algo que está, sem sombra de dúvidas, ligado também ao desenvolvimento artístico do realizador e co-argumentista Sergio Leone, que a cada novo filme dos Dólares soube colocar novos elementos técnicos, cénicos e cinematográficos às narrativas e aos diálogos vividos entre as personagens. É óbvio que cada um dos filmes da trilogia pode ser compreendido sem ser necessário ver os outros, ou que a ordem cronológica de lançamento das obras é irrelevante (visto que, para muitos, «O Bom, o Mau e o Vilão» se trata de uma prequela dos dois volumes anteriores), mas só se pode notar verdadeiramente esta evolução do \"Homem sem Nome\" e da forma como ele se torna cada vez mais próximo do público, se se vir os filmes pela data de estreia. Embora este terceiro seja o que verdadeiramente se destaca de toda a trilogia, toda ela é de visionamento altamente recomendável. De destacar, mais uma vez, o tom épico e semi-divino da banda sonora de Ennio Morricone (é impossível, para quem conhece a melodia da \"theme\" de «O Bom, o Mau e o Vilão» - sinceramente, existe algum ser humano que não tenha ouvido já a música? - , não ficar preso logo nos créditos iniciais do filme - e principalmente se se estiver acompanhado de um portentoso sistema doméstico de som), que mostra também sinais de evolução em termos transcendentais e ser uma das maiores obras de toda a História da música feita para Cinema. Tudo isto (a maior densidade das personagens, do mise-en-scène e da banda sonora) se junta a um argumento recheado de grandes diálogos memoráveis que ficam no ouvido e na mente do espectador e que de lá não irão sair por muito tempo. \n\n\n\nEste filme mostra um Sergio Leone em estado de graça (estado esse que é presenciado, de outras maneiras, nas outras duas obras primas do Mestre que mencionei no primeiro parágrafo), no expoente máximo da sua criatividade (que, felizmente, persistiu para os filmes seguintes), sendo um grande épico western, que envolve a guerra civil americana e a forma algo filosófica, e ao mesmo tempo divertida, como Blondie e Tuco se metem no meio do conflito que faz parte dos livros de História americanos. Para terminar, e porque não me resta mais nada a acrescentar a esta obra magistral, apenas refiro a única coisa que não gostei em «O Bom, o Mau e o Vilão»: que tivesse acabado. Por mim, ainda hoje, passados três dias de ter visto o filme, eu continuaria a acompanhar as tropelias e pistolarias do \"Homem sem Nome\", sem sombra de dúvidas. Não em formato non-stop, porque não possuo vista para isso. Mas fiquei tão agradado com este filme que me entristeci muito quando chegou ao fim e me apercebi que não havia mais. Mas por si só, esta é uma fita que deve ser vista várias vezes. Tenho a noção que muita coisa boa me escapou neste primeiro visionamento, e já tenho, pelo menos, uma dezena de revisões prometidas a mim próprio até ao final da minha existência. Porque tem de ser.",

            "content": "Not much more than I can say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was the first western that truly hooked me. The first time I watched this I had seen a couple westerns before, but nothing blew me away, they were all just fine. Even the two other Dollars movies I watched before hand I thought were fine, they were cool and Clint Eastwood was awesome. They just didn't hook me. Then I put in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. \n\nFrom the moment Eli Wallach's Tuco jumps out of the saloon window I was hooked, and immediately fell in love with The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Clint is again great as the so called \"Man with No Name\", though in this he has a name, Blondie. He's great again, though the real star of the film is Eli Wallach as Tuco, the titular \"the Ugly\". Every moment on the screen he's doing something interesting, wether it's a way he reads a line or just his little twitches and mannerisms. He makes the role so memorable. He makes you believe a Jewish man from New York City is a Latino outlaw. Lee Van Cleef is back as a new character in this loose prequel as the titular \"the Bad\", and bad he is. He's just a steely eyed menace who will stop at nothing to get the gold he's after. Killing men and children and slapping women around for it. \n\nSergio Leone's masterful direction is on full display here. Whip cuts, wide beautiful shots and extreme closeups. He directs the absolute shit out it. He makes a near 3 hour film feel 2, every moment there's either something going on or a beautiful shot. There is no wasted moment in this. The final stand off, is as tense as it is iconic. Still after all these times of seeing it I'm still on the edge of my seat.\n\nThough when there is a more quieter part it's being moved along by the Maestro himself Ennio Morricone's absolutely iconic and brilliant score. There's beautiful pieces that make you want to cry, then there's the scary and tense songs that still feel melodic. Of course the epic main theme and the \"Ecstasy of Gold\" them when Tuco is running around the cemetery like a mad man. The score is easily my favorite score of all time, and the first score I ever purchased.\n\nThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly is why I love movies and fell in love with them. It's an epic in every sense of the word. You go on this journey with these characters, feel every bit of pain and anguish, the betrayal's and trust issues. Every emotion is felt during the course of this film. It's a masterpiece in every sense of the word. A film that was influenced from movies before, but has influenced thousands of movies since. It has inspired people to love this genre, to love film and to go into filmmaking. It's truly a work of art and we are all better for having this film out into the world.",

What it lacks in \"Once Upon A Time In The West\" type focus and relevance, it makes up for in scope.  Each of the three primary characters Blondie (The Good), Angel Eyes (The Bad), and Tuco (The Ugly), though one dimensional, are entertaining.  Clint Eastwood's classic delivery goes without saying.  The film covers quite a bit of geopolitical ground, crossing Civil War lines a few times in what should be New Mexico.  \n\nWhile I was left a bit disappointed upon first viewing, I realized on the second viewing that the film actually radiates style and freshness decades on.  From the stylized opening credits, to the bold violence and fun use of freeze frames later on, this is no ordinary Western.  The epic three hour extended cut is engrossing and fun almost all the way through.  \n\nDue to Leone's directing style, the single biggest problem with the film is poorly synchronized audio.  There are way too many instances where the words said do not match the actors' lips.  Looking beyond that somewhat shoddy sound editing, the film is visually beautiful.  The Fascist Spain shooting locations and production design look good, giving convincing performances as Trans-Mississippi Theater New Mexico.  Ennio Morricone's score is also awesomely iconic.\n\nI still definitely think that Leone's \"Once Upon A Time In The West\" is possibly the best Western ever made, spaghetti or not.  That being said, the epic scope and entertainment value of \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" gives it premium access to the hall of classic films of any genre.  (23 February 2013)",

            "content": "The darkly comic centerpiece of the Dollars westerns, and arguably one of the most influential pieces of pop cinema in the 20th century. It's less interested in the rambling plot than in the contrast between the three protagonists (or, when it comes to greed, lack thereof). Clint Eastwood's Blondie is of course an iconic presence, whose Man with No Name was a startlingly new character perfect for Leone's wiping the slate on the West. Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes is a dogged, charismatic villain whose relish in his own selfishness is strongly disquieting. But the soul of the movie is arguably the new character, Eli Wallach's Tuco. What could have been a one-note comic relief is instead a complex, strangely moving character who's as sharp and relentless as series veterans Eastwood and Cleef. Leone's set pieces dazzle one after another - our introductions to all three, Blondie and Tuco's unique, death-defying racket, Tuco's revenge on Blondie in the desert sun, a haunting interlude in a prisoner-of-war camp, an intrenched, bitter outpost whose existential predicament is Leone's cynical thesis on war, and of course, the three-way duel at the finale. It doesn't take itself all that seriously, but Leone's pulp-operatic style infuses true grandeur in what's really a story of three crooks trying to find a treasure for themselves while getting rid of the competition. Funny but brutal, stirring yet sardonic, it's not only the Man with No Name's finest hour, it's a film that took apart an entire genre and remade it in its own image.",

            "content": "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is both easily my favorite western, and my favorite movie of all time. It's the final part of the Dollars trilogy, and in my opinion, the most epic, entertaining, and flat out awesome of the three, and its influence on both western and films in general is still clear today. Usually, trilogies progressively get worse as the series continues, but with the Dollars trilogy, Sergio Leone managed to improve each time. With each film, you can see his direction improve and mature, and by the time he made The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, he was already crowned as one of the kings of the western genre, but he managed to combine all of his talents and created both this movie and the more serious, darker Once Upon a Time in the West, and later, the overlooked Fistful of Dynamite. The western genre is my favorite genre- both spaghetti and American ones-, but my love for the genre all started with the Dollars trilogy. It's an incredibly iconic movie, with both its title and its many different memorable aspects sinking into pop culture and western stereotypes.\n\nOne of those stereotypes is The Man With No Name, played by Clint Eastwood, who played the same role for the past two movies, and in my opinion, his role is probably my favorite movie character ever. However, the conflicts that he faces throughout the trilogy are not linked- the only reason this is even considered a trilogy is because they're all directed by Sergio Leone and they star Clint Eastwood. It wasn't Leone's intention to make this a trilogy, but it's referred to as a trilogy for convenience purposes anyways. Here, he played \"The Good\", who although isn't really a \"good\" person, is a lot smarter and accurate at shooting than the others in the trio. The next person is The Bad, played by Lee Van Cleef, who is perfect, and his role in this movie and For A Few Dollars more, the predecessor, rose Lee Van to fame. He's ruthless, cold blooded, and chilling, and his facial expressions alone define his personality perfectly. He has a straight, menacing face, and he's always one step ahead. What makes me sad is how overlooked Lee Van Cleef is as an actor, and although for many of the westerns he played in, he did play a somewhat similar role, I feel like he should be more recognized because of how cool he is. Last but not least is The Ugly, played by Eli Wallach, who's is a bandit that is absolutely hilarious and pretty dumb as well, and later forms a sort of bond with The Good. Arguably, he's equal in terms of quality and likability to The Good in this movie. However, if there's one thing that connects these three characters the most, is their greed for the hidden cache of gold. \n\nThis trio- The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (hence the title) are all rivaling against each other to search for the cache of gold hidden in a graveyard, while caught up in the Civil War. The opening of this film is perfection, introducing the three leads of the movie. However, the part where The Bad interrogates a former soldier has plenty of tension. In fact, Quentin Tarantino even used a similar style for the opening of Inglourious Basterds, where Hans Landa interrogates a French farmer. Later, The Good meets The Ugly, and they participate in a trick where The Ugly, who is a wanted bandit, is turned in by The Good, and right when he's about to get hanged, The Good shoots the rope and he's freed. They keep repeating this tactic to exploit the bounty hunter business, and overtime, they slowly form a bond in the hunt for the gold. The Ugly is hilarious and pretty stupid as well, with tons of awesome quotes. In fact, everyone in this movie has great, memorable quotes that each reflect their personalities. From there on, the plot progresses and the movie becomes more epic by the second, up until the haunting finale, which is probably my favorite movie scene ever. \n\nHowever, how good would this movie be without Ennio Morricone's score? Ennio, who is my favorite movie composer, has conducted tons of western soundtracks (and movie soundtracks in general) that I all love, but here, I think he topped his music. It's iconic and beautiful, and without it, many scenes wouldn't be anywhere as epic, and would lack lots of the tension that defined the film. His music for this movie pretty much created the stereotype and current imagery of the West. The cinematography is also brilliant, with wide, beautiful shots showcasing the dry, grainy desert landscape, and you can tell that the production values of the film were higher than the first two in the trilogy. That being said, this is not an extremely serious movie, and as I stated previously, there's tons of hilarious humor, especially through the \"partnership\", which is sort of a love/hate one between The Good and The Ugly. With Once Upon a Time in the West, Leone made a far more gritty, realistic, and dark western, with pretty much no humor but an atmosphere and an insane amount of tension that makes it nearly as good as this movie.\n\nOverall, I could go on forever and ever, praising this film with no limits, but I'm sure you can understand as to why this is my favorite movie of all time. For me, at least, there will never be a movie better than this one, and I love this movie to no end. It's both the definitive western and the definitive spaghetti western, and it's a film that even non-western fans can appreciate. It's influence is to be seen anywhere, even if you don't notice it, and its had a legacy that has barely been matched since. I've watched this film countless times, and upon each viewing, it's just as entertaining as the last time. This is not only the perfection of the western genre, but of movies in general.",

Otro detalle es que en la trama hay una escena donde parece ser el momento en que \"El Hombre sin Nombre\" adopta su look clÃ¡sico con su poncho hacia el climax de la  cinta, pero al ser la tercera, incluso podrÃ­a pensarse que es una precuela, pero al ubicarse en medio de la Guerra Civil, entra la pregunta de quÃ (C) tanto tiempo pasa en la segunda, ya que es dinero confederado el que se muestra allÃ­, por lo tanto mÃ¡s que una trilogÃ­a, es mejor ver estos tres filmes como una antologÃ­a del Oeste donde tienen cierta uniÃ³n por el personaje de Clint Eastwood pero incluso eso complicado de cimentar. Leone vuelve a triunfar en sus casteos, ya que luego de los aciertos con Eastwood y Van Cleef, aquÃ­ castea a Eli Wallach como \"El Feo\" que es quien se roba la pelÃ­cula con su colorido personaje que logra ponerse de tÃº a tÃº con las otras dos estrellas de la pelÃ­cula. Este filme tanto por su duraciÃ³n como el presupuesto para las escenas, puede ser facilmente el filme mÃ¡s ambicioso de Spaghetti Western clÃ¡sico que ustedes lleguen a ver.",

However, Blondie (Eastwood) is the one who turns him in and then helps Tuco escape after he picks up the reward. Finally, the two accomplices split up on bad terms.

First they have run ins with Angel Eyes an the Union and then they got caught up in a Civil War skirmish. The two of them endure it all and go to the cemetary where the gold is.

Watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer.\n\nWhat I love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. We don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about Tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.'\n\nTo see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great Clint Eastwood and his performance at 'The Man with no Name' or 'Blondie' as Tuco would address him as. He is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. From his strategic thinking in outsmarting Tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. Then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. Without spoiling anything, all I could say is that I felt the ending was clever in a way I didn't see coming at all.\n\nWith a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film I highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. On that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from Sergio Leone. From the films I've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon. Even with a film as dark as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or 'Once Upon a Time in America,' Leone still manages to emit a feeling of warmth through his stories, and with all its guns and grit, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is pure beauty on film.",

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, without any doubt, has done a crack job here, the lengthy narrative never cease to fall into tepid, three leading characters are richly depicted with accumulated details and minor plots, Eli Wallachâ(TM)s the ugly, who receives the most amount of screen time and rendered as a complete hypocrisy and opportunist, is the arch-protagonist, Eastwood and Van Cleefâ(TM)s roles are less colorful but more pragmatic to be idolised in the hero and anti-hero cinema realm. \n\nOne cannot evade Morriconeâ(TM)s masterly work (not only in Leoneâ(TM)s filmography), but here, his knack of enhancing the whole filmâ(TM)s temperament has been comprehensively facilitated, the hyena-mimicking theme tune for me is something worth persisting for my entire life. The very much discussed and highly appreciated Mexican standoff could be regarded as the pinnacle of the wholesome western films, Leoneâ(TM)s obsession with relentless close-ups is another trademark of its own kind. \n\nLeoneâ(TM)s film career is an underachieved one, and most of his fame has been accruing after his untimely  decease in 1989 at the age of 60, with only 7 feature films under his rein (another one I have watched is his swan song ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA, 1984, 8/10), if only he could live a bit longer, his feat would easily stride outside his comfort zone and evolve himself and his work with the time, like what Martin Scorsese has attained. \n\nWhat should I whine about the film? I really cannot say it explicitly, the only thing impedes me from rating it higher is the innate trait of the grumpy and grubby world, which seems to me like a pit on earth.",

I felt that Eastwood and Van Cleef's characters were put on the sideline for most of the film.

The ending is one of the best endings of any western that I have seen.

However, this movie is much more then just background music.  I simply love how much is told with pictures and expression in the actors face and not with dialogue.  Why this might be a downfall with some, it's a hit with me.  The final 25 minutes are as good as any in film to me.  The music, the shots around the graves, the looks on these guys faces are priceless.  It's not the greatest dub job in the world, which is why this doesn't get a higher ranking, as the sync between lips moving and the actual words isn't great.  What's great about this movie is that each character has some serious ups and downs and looks down and out, yet the three guys who all team up in some fashion or another at one point, all have one showdown at the end.

            "content": "Sergio Leone has pretty much defined the perception of Westerns in today's culture with his idiosyncratic take on it. For the longest time I've refused to accept Spaghetti Westerns as true Westerns, seeing them only as bastardized, bloated, sensationalized parodies of the beloved American genre. Which, in a sense, they were. However, Leone's Dollars trilogy is still composed of three mindblowingly kick-ass films. So, I've compromised and decided that even though Spaghetti Westerns clearly differentiate from the traditional Western as much as they are derivatives, that doesn't mean they haven't earned their place to be equals, or even superiors, in every way. \r\n\r\n\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is the final film of the Dollars trilogy, which started with a pale imitation of \"Yojimbo\" (Fistful,) improved vastly with the impeccable \"For a Few Dollars More,\" and finally peaked with Leone's personalized, auteuristic, bravura masterpiece. This slippery slope to greatness features a filmmaker who is constantly evolving and improving on his craft. Eastwood's \"man with no name,\" opportunist-vigilante-with-a-heart-of-gold archetype started as a gunslinging mimicry of Mifune's ronin and, perhaps, even Alan Ladd's Shane; \"Fistful\" was more or less Eastwood being badass for an hour and a half. By the time of \"More,\" he's involved in a much more layered story, finally emerging as a manifestation of a conscience or an angel, dishing out tough love with his colt and, presumably, his massive girth.  \r\n\r\nIn \"Good,\" Eastwood's character is even treated to a character arch when he witnesses the inane slaughter of confederate and union soldiers by their mutually bellicose hands. He transforms from the opportunist bounty hunter to an opportunist bounty hunter who has at least realized his place in a larger, humanist context. The two prior main conflicts in the trilogy, offered by megalomaniac, cutthroat gangs and an antagonist also possessing great skill at his craft, manifest into Van Cleef's character, the \"Bad.\" Nothing too complex here; however, Leone perfectly presents a villain pristine for a great story. We're introduced to Van Cleef's character, see him do something awful which infringes our sense of justice, and, for the rest of the film, we hate him and hope that our heroes stop him. No mitigation or meandering that a good amount of modern films would do in ruining a perfectly good bad guy. \r\n\r\nThe jewel of the crown would be the mediator, in a sense, of the two, Wallach's character Tuco, the \"Ugly.\" In \"More,\" Leone breaks new ground by actually having an internal conflict in a character's backstory (Van Cleef's broken heart and vengeful drive to find inner peace by killing his nemesis in addition to being a ruthless yet wise bounty hunter.) In \"GBU,\" Tuco is a character who not only exhibits uncanny mastery of the firearm, keeping true to the trilogy's spirit of showcasing superhuman abilities, but who has also been written a superb backstory with depth. Carrying a swashbuckling attitude, a selfish greed which flirts too much with the itch to betray, and having no sense of altruism whatsoever, Tuco seemed like a character to be vilified until we learn of his past concerning his family issues. Pretty refreshing stuff for a film featuring people shooting at each other for three hours. Add a remarkable relationship between Tuco and Eastwood's character, one which grew out of a previous one of deceit, ambiguity, torture, and profit, as well as a MacGuffin treasure box which brings these three characters together, and we now have a story that is rich in addition to being thrillingly entertaining.\r\n\r\nClearly the film is very character driven and it's the turmoils and complex reciprocation among these characters which make this film such a wild treat. But, just as laudable are Leone's talent at milking any sequence dry for its suspenseful tension and his ability of aiding that with his incredible montage techniques, which, in my opinion, are so sophisticated and brilliant in their simplicity and bluntness that they harken back to Eisenstein's mastery. Themes from traditional Westerns such as camaraderie or the individual pitted against society are turned inside out to emphasize awesome shootouts. Toss Ennio Morricone, who more or less composed our current musical imagery of the West, usurping the folk music of Ford's films, into the mix and cinematic magic is born in a film which easily lives up to its impossibly high hype.",

I loved it. What had changed? \n\nFor one thing, I took more notice of the technical side of the film. I paid attention to Leone's famous use of close-ups, his selection of memorable character actors, and his wonderful scene-setting. I admired the detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes, the props and the costumes and all those weird, wonderful faces that Leone clearly loved to photograph. Oh and Clint Eastwood pulled a great performance aswell.",

After so many back stabs and so many false leads, I gave up on the story and just focused on the characters. While the characters are also flawed, they at least were mostly interesting. Clint was his typical silent and emotionless self, but I thought that The Bad and The Ugly were fascinating. And like \"A Fistful of Dollars\", The Good the Bad and the Ugly has breathtaking camerawork and a chilling soundtrack. I would normally give this movie a 3 star score, but I can at least appreciate its impact in the genre so I'll raise it a half a star. It may be epic in its length and storylines, but this film is unfortunately only sporadically truly epic, which is a shame because I was expecting a whole lot more.",

This film was originality in Italian but later dubbed the voices in English. I had no idea it was dubbed when I first saw it because it was very well dubbed. Maybe it's because the main actors dubbed their own voices. This also featured a thrilling and really good original score. I'm actually listening to it now so I have better chance of remembering the film. I think I've heard it way before I even knew about this film. So the score is obviously still used in other works. The score along with the scenery gave this a genuine western look considering ti was shot in Spain. For the most part, their where many mistakes. For example, did anyone notice that they used the 50 star American flag. But it's not a big deal. The acting was amazing by the tree protagonist. The writing was fabulous. I liked how the script focused on the relation between all three of the main characters. It build up to the last face off between the three. How was on who's side and who wasn't. Even up to the last shot you still can't tell the relationship between each character. It's very complicated in a way that it's personal. The production values where to die for. Classic westerns always have good production values. The whole costumes to the scenery to the guns in their holsters. Looks like it's fun making westerns. Although I won't really like to dress up like a cowboy. But that's just me. Lastly, the direction by Sergio Leone was the good. Not perfect buy yes it was really good. It didn't really like how it was fast paced considering westerns tend to be slow paced. I also didn't really like the camera angles but I've seen worst. If you like westerns then this is a must.

            "content": "There must come a time, in the life of every great commercial filmmaker, when utilizing elements of narrative and sucessive formulas of entertainment is just not enough. Regardless of the intention of the product and how it is developped both in idea and as a result, the creator of the work unintetionally develops a deeper, almost accidental grasp of the world on which his creations unfold. That's what we can say, for example, of sequels like \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and \"The Dark Knight\". In both of them, we were unexpectedly taken into a revision of every single element composing those worlds, and a sudden feel of awe and involvement came to the audience as we witnessed how the world became grander and more immersive, and not just in the screen. Perhaps that's what makes a sequel successful, I'd say. The groundwork doesn't have to be that good, it can merely be the notion of the emerging world... but then comes the 'dwarf', smiling at you and signaling how, in spite of unplanned schedule, you are making art with your formulas... It's just inspiration, my friends, and that's something art simply cannot fight. \n\nWhy am I saying all this? It's obvious that Sergio Leone, already a brilliant technical director, looked forward to encompass the artistic crudeness and reality of his stories. The third installment of \"The Man With No Name\", is arguably the most ambitious and fulfilling western film out there. Not that there are not formulas in here. They are still present, only that they're not just elements of a simple storyline with human clichÃ (C)s. This time, I would say Leone is trying to explore the formulas, and get the most out of them. We even get an insight into the political and historical background of the era! An entire sequence involves two of the main characters fighting for the Northern army. We even get to meet Lee Van Cleef as, not only a bounty hunter, but a captain on the same army. \n\nLeone is also getting into the characters' psychological nature... someway or another. The Mexican-American Border is cursed, no doubt about it, filled with dread and outcast spirits, and Ennio Morricone's score manages to transmit that directly to the viewer. His trumpets cry in despair, almost like the millions of souls on that cemetery on which the final duel takes place. \n\nThis is a movie that was made in an era where films were unnecesarily long and detailed, and yet, it managed to make me feel like after watching \"The Dark Knight\". This is what would happen when a film product is comissioned to a person whose artistic ambitions know no limits. It is the result of a director searching for the human nature and the authenticity of the world... it's what happens when a product becomes art.",

Sergio Leone's famous \"Dollars\" trilogy comes to an epic conclusion with the three outlaws meeting together in Sadhill's cemetery, mixed with one of the most iconic scores in cinema history composed by Ennio Morricone, and a thrilling story that makes every minute entertaining in the film's three hours running-time.",
