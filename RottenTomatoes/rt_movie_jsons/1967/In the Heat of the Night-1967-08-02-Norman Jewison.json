    "summary": "African-American Philadelphia police detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) is arrested on suspicion of murder by Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger), the racist police chief of tiny Sparta, Mississippi. After Tibbs proves not only his own innocence but that of another man, he joins forces with Gillespie to track down the real killer. Their investigation takes them through every social level of the town, with Tibbs making enemies as well as unlikely friends as he hunts for the truth.",

            "content": "One of the best movies I've seen in years. It's gritty, and it really makes you think about racism, while maybe giving you a bit of hope for humanity (see Steiger's character). Quite progressive for 1967 I believe. Steiger starts as a racist at the start of the film, but he develops respect for Poitier as the film progresses. This isn't overdone, but it is certainly optimistic. The film is a noir mystery, but it doesn't rely on the plot directly for its thrills. For this reason, and because it's only 110 minutes long, I forgave this. I truly enjoyed watching it.",

It does well at highlighting the prejudice African Americans faced, regardless of their professional occupations or not. Its a sobering watch in parts - the way the local police chief laughs off some of what the African American (Virgil Tibbs) says, ignoring his clearly decent background makes for depressing viewing certainly.\n\nHowever, there is also prejudice shown towards others in this film, mainly that of womenn. I'd say it does well at highlighting such social issues and is a relatively engrossing watch. I would recommend this film, yes.",

The story arc was acceptable if you're not looking for realism, although not unexpected, and it felt like some of the runtime could have been shaved off. It wasn't what I'd call especially enjoyable though, and there could have been a bit more character development. The villain didn't get much attention at all.

Rod Steiger is Gillespie a racist police chief with serious Andy Sipowicz level short sleeves, more intent on 'keeping the peace' at the cost of true justice, happy with pinning the blame of any suspect, guilty or not, that will allow him to keep a lid on things. \n\nPoitier combines quiet dignity and controlled anger in the face of the south's blatant racism and when his anger does bubble to the surface, such as the  iconic delivery of his 'They Call Me Mr Tibbs' line (which is also the title of the sequel) the results are pure fire. Steiger wins the begrudging repect of the audience as he chooses right over wrong in his defence of Tibbs in several key moments of blatant racial discrimination and outright hatred. \n\nI was a little skeptical as to why Tibb's police chief in Philidephia is SO keen for him to stick around to help solve this Murder in an entirely different jurisdiction - but hey it serves the story so let's just go with it. \n\nDirector Norman Jewison, creates an atmosphere of tension, evocative of the title with the oppressive night time heat dripping from the frame and felt even more soundly when accompanied by THE Ray Charles' fantastic theme song. \n\nOnce again, for a movie that was made 55 years ago it also sadly still relevant today - in a society where we have just seen the conviction of three white men for the murder of an unarmed African-American male and the numerous reports every day of racial charged wrongful arrests - the fact that Poitier is arrested within the first 10 minutes just because of the colour of his skin - feels as though we could he watching the exact same story in 2022. \n\nOn a lighter note - one of the police officers in the movie is named 'Shagbag'.",

Gillespie (Rod Steiger) investigated. In Sparta, Mississippi, Philip Colbert was an industrialist who financed a factory on top of an old orchid plantation owned by Endicott (Larry Gates). Endicott, a racist owner of a cotton plantation, became upset about the news, so he sent a group of white hooligans to rob him. The scene of the crime took place in the construction site full of dried orchid roots and pine pegs. Ralph, one of the hooligans and cook in a low-class diner, (Anthony James) wanted to stash Colbert's money in a purse and a fake pie to pay for an abortion. This serves as an explanation as to why he hides the lemon meringue pie from customers. Before, he raped and impregnated sixteen-year-old Delores (Quentin Dean), causing the ire of her brother Purdy (James Patterson), one of the gang members. During the robbery, Ralph accidentally killed Colbert, stole the murdered victim's Lincoln, put the carcass on the passenger's seat, and dumped the body in an alley near Delores's home. Meanwhile, at 2am, Sam Wood (Warren Oates) ate at Ralph's diner, took a good look at Delores, and discovered Colbert's body. So, with that said, Ralph is not only a racist murderer, but also a monstrous statutory rapist.\n\n(4 Fly-Ridden Lemon Meringue Pies out of 5)",

            "content": "Norman Jewison's celebrated film about a black police officer helping out a racist white police chief with a murder investigation in a small Mississippi town is rightly famous. This isn't just because it won the Academy Award for Best Picture and a few other Oscars besides, but because by tackling the issue of racism head-on whilst the Civil Rights Movement was in full swing, it made for a powerfully topical movie. \nBased on a novel by John ball, In the Heat of the Night is on one level a police procedural, as a rich industrialist is murdered in Sparta, Mississippi, and the police have to find out who the killer is. On this basic level alone, the story works well, throwing up false leads as the actions of motivations of several possible suspects are explored, whilst eventually revealing the real culprit in a way that is both satisfying within the context of the narrative but genuinely surprising. Some well-used misdirection helps: since Colbert's factory might have resulted in an influx of black works to the town, Gillespie and Tibbs both suspect that it was racially motivated and thus so does the audience. With Harvey Oberst, Endicott, and Sam Wood all written as plausible suspects, the story then shows how the police working out that each is innocent, at least of murder.\nBut the murder mystery is not of course the film's main selling point. That is the unlikely pairing of Rod Steiger's racist, redneck Chief Gillespie with Sidney Poiter's educated, well-spoken homicide detective Virgil Tibbs. If pairing up two protagonists who clearly aren't going to get along and having them gradually develop a mutual respect was a movie clich\u00e9 even in 1967, it doesn't detract from the quality of either Stirling Silliphant's screenplay or of the performances of the two leads. It also doesn't change the fact that witnessing on screen the all too believable racism that Tibbs faces is still appalling, from the moment that Sam Wood arrests him for murder simply because he's black and a stranger in town. Later, he faces lynch mobs, whose violent intention is still not quite as reprehensible as plantation owner Endicott's polite, quietly offensive views. \nTibbs is superbly written and Poitier plays the role with colossal dignity and a simmering, barely suppressed fury when he's confronted with bigotry: a particularly believable touch is when he confesses to Gillespie that he allowed his own prejudices towards Endicott to lead him to assume that he was responsible for Colbert's murder. Tibbs returning Endicott's slap was so celebrated at the time because it was genuinely shocking to audiences; now it's celebrated simply because Endicott is so arrogant that he can't imagine that it would happen \u2013 or that Gillespie would simply stand back and allow it to happen \u2013 and is seen weeping after his visitors depart. But it is Tibbs' relationship with Gillespie that provides the film with its heart, from the moment he calmly allows Wood to arrest him and Gillespie to interrogate him before revealing that he is a police officer. \nRod Steiger's performance as Gillespie is perfectly pitched: for all his obvious ingrained prejudices when they first meet, he swallows his pride enough to realise that asking Tibbs' for help might allow him to find the killer, and despite later clashes, they end up becoming \u2013 if not exactly friends \u2013 then at least two men who respect and understand each other. One of the film's best scenes is when they sit and talk in Gillespie's house and Gillespie opens up enough to talk about his life, but stops short of accepting pity; Steiger is incredibly believable. Their final scene together is nicely understated: Gillespie carries Tibb's suitcase for him to the train and they say goodbye in way that allows both actors to say a great deal with very few lines. \nJewison makes much use of close-ups, exploiting the facial expressions of the actors, especially the two leads to good effect, and he also proves adept at handling the film's few action sequences, such as when Harvey is pursued by the police and the fight in the warehouse, which has a real sense of danger. Quincy Jones' soundtrack also helps to enhance the feel of the film, providing exactly the Southern feel shot through with blues that was intended. It would be nice to believe that the racist attitudes challenged by In the Heat of the Night were a thing of the past; even if that were true however, in challenging bigotry it remains as powerful and relevant today as it was in 1967.",

            "content": "\"They call me Mr. Tibbs!\" Though I had never seen the movie, or the long running TV series based on it, I was familiar with what the overall premise was. That didn't matter in the least. The 1968 Oscar winning Best Picture, In the Heat of the Night, was a tour de force of acting skill as Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger are superbly matched head to head.\n\nSteiger plays small town (fictitious Sparta, Mississippi) Police Chief Bill Gillipsie. Gillipsie is a somewhat lazy and very bigoted man, steeped in the numerous privileges his skin color and bravado provide him in a southern town where desegregation is barely a decade old. Sidney Poitier plays Philadelphia homicide detective Virgil Tibbs. Tibbs is initially hauled into the Sparta Police Station because he happens to be at the local train station early on the same morning a murder occurs. Oh, and also because, well\u2026 he happens to be a black man with a large amount of cash on him. For Gillipsie's deputy that's reason enough to accuse him of murder.\n\nOnce Virgil's status as a big-city police officer is discovered, events lead to him and Chief Gillipsie being reluctantly forced to work together to solve the murder. The whodunit quickly takes a back seat though, as issues of race and preconceived notions related to race eclipse the film. Quincy Jones provides a score that eloquently supports the film and often drives it. Some of Sidney Potier's best moments are when he is telling a story through his facial expressions alone, devoid of any dialogue. Rod Steiger takes a role that easily could have fallen into caricature or stereotype, and provides it with just the right smidgen of humility that you can actually buy into the hesitant mutual respect that they each express at the film's satisfying finale. Steiger would win the Oscar for Best Male Dramatic Performance for his role.\n\nFrom an historic perspective, it was fantastic seeing Tibbs return a back handed face slap to local white cotton plantation owner, Mr. Endicott. Endicott says, \"There was a time when I could have had you shot,\" and as a viewer I couldn''t help but think, \"Well those days are over.\" Ironically, during a later scene when Officer Tibbs is questioning a local woman of color, he tells her, \"There's white time in jail and there's colored time in jail, and the worst kind of time you can do is colored time\". At this moment, as a viewer I had to acknowledge, \"I guess we haven't come so far after all\".",

The behind the scenes stories are almost as fascinating as the movie itself, with Sydney Poitier sleeping with a gun under his bed while filming in Mississippi, due to the antagonism he had previously experienced in that very same state. You could almost call it a buddy cop movie, where the 2 conflicting officers don't get along, but eventually develop a mutual respect for one another. But this movie is much deeper than that, tackling issues of racism and discrimination by showing that, at heart, we all just want to see justice prevail, and that working together, regardless of colour, creed or background, we're all in this together. The plot seems confusing at times, and some of the dialogue is rendered inaudible due to the often thick accents. But it's a film of legendary status for good reason, and if you consider yourself a true movie buff, it's a movie you have to see at least once.",

            "content": "A thoughtful murder mystery about America's racism problem.\n\nDirector Norman Jewison's mystery drama In the Heat of the Night (1967) is a riveting murder investigation into a small Mississippi town called Sparta. This rural hellscape is as brutal, barren, and backwards at its ancient reaching name suggests. Jewison's setting of the American South is apt for a story about deeply brewed hate since they have a long history of hate crimes, hate groups, and racist Southerners. It's the most dangerous and unnerving backdrop for Sidney Poitier to be in really.\n\nJewison's direction is stalwart and steady creating a haunting atmosphere in this little Mississippi town. The slow panning shots and long still shots of characters allow for anything to happen. The camera follows characters down long streets and hallways for a creepy effect. You can tell that In the Heat of the Night's long winding cinematography influenced The French Connection and Mississippi Burning. The slow methodical approach to the film's investigation gives you a similar vibe to a dark thriller like L.A. Confidential or Zodiac.\n\nQuincy Jones' score is a blend of jazz, soul, and funk that makes chase sequences feel brisk and make nighttime scenes feel disquieting. Jones composed the perfect soundscape for In the Heat of the Night's moody tone. Ray Charles' main theme is a wonderful bringer of jazz and soul for an authentic feel and somber vibe.\n\nSidney Poitier is steadfast and intelligent as the brilliant homicide expert Detective Virgil Tibbs for the Pennsylvania Police Department stranded in Sparta, Mississippi. His calm and professional demeanor is impressive as poor Poitier is arrested, insulted, threatened, ridiculed, and assaulted by every racist redneck in Mississippi. He plays it cool and comes out of In the Heat of the Night looking like the smartest detective ever.He acts with a subtle nuance that depicts Tibbs as clever, observant, and even hateful to those who wrong him, which gives his character a realistic complexity. Poitier is captivating to the brutal end and a fine leading man.\n\nFurthermore, Rod Steiger steals the show as the incompetant racist Chief of Police Bill Gillespie. His stocky stature, slow speech, rage filled voice, and angry banter is unforgettable. I think he only manages to upstage Poitier because it is a loud obnoxious role like how he chew gum with his mouth open or is quick to arrest the first suspect he sees. His on screen chemistry with Poitier is interesting as it really looks like they despise each other.\n\nI should mention a young Scott Wilson gets a strong supporting role as the racist local Harvey Oberst wrongly accused of the murder. I like Warren Oates as the bumbling racist beat cop Officer Sam Wood.\n\nIn short, In the Heat of the Night is a poignant crime drama on American racial politics, police corruption, police procedure, and American justice. Ironically, this piece of cinematic Americana is directed by a Canadian director!",

The result is a performance that transcends off the camera, off the screen, and onto your living room floor (or wherever you're watching the film). He is that good. Steiger works as a great contrast to the sophisticated Poitier by making us believe he's a rough caloot who is initially prejudice, but can learn to appreciate others when given the chance/exposure.",

The atmosphere and behavior of the characters all fits perfectly for the deep south in that time period. It\u2019s powerful because we get to see all ranges of racism, and even certain people slowly finding ways to get past their prejudice. Perhaps the most remarkable performance in that regard is Rod Steiger who plays the police chief that has to admit something that is completely out of character for him...he\u2019s not as good as a black man. The conversations between the two leads are so entertaining because you can sense the slowly developed respect they both find for one another. The real magic of this movie is the remarkable performance of Sidney Poitier. He brings a pride and gravitas to the situation that allows us to see why he is in charge despite the fact that others try to intimidate him. His controlled silence in the early scenes in the face of all the judgment tells us all we need to know about the character, and it\u2019s surprisingly impactful when he delivers that iconic line. When he takes a lead role in the autopsy in a later scene it is satisfying to see him in the dominant position for a change. Perhaps the most unexpected thing in the entire film is that we are even allowed to see his fallibility as he succumbs to some prejudice of his own. With all this talk about the amazing acting performances and the racial issues, I\u2019ve almost left out the primary plot of the film. This story is also a great murder mystery. I\u2019m always delighted by that genre and I love the fact that we are allowed to piece together clues along with the characters in the film. It\u2019s an intriguing mystery with quite a few false leads and dead ends to keep you guessing. There\u2019s very little that I dislike in this film. There is one acting performance that I didn\u2019t love, but I\u2019ll avoid going into that with much detail because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything. The point is that any complaint is a pointless nitpick when I\u2019m talking about a film as superb as In the Heat of the Night.",

Then again, in one of the key scenes of the film, Jewison points directly to the slow churn of structural machinery, the continuum of racism across generations (which is one reason, I suppose, that racism and nationalism are such easy bedfellows)\u00e2\"a full century after the Civil War, and there are still plantations and, for all intents and purposes, modern slave owners.

            "content": "A very engaging and provocative movie that deals with multiple themes like racial prejudice, discrimination, carelessness of law and loneliness all engulfed inside a central crime thriller plot. What works even better is the character development which is elevated even beautifully by Rod Steiger's masterful performance. While the additional layers are well written and even well executed, the central plot lacks the required thriller element partially due to emotional disconnect with the victim, leisure progress of this plot and way too many distractions. \n\nOfficer Sam Wood (Warren Oates) comes across a deceased body of a rich business man on the road during his scheduled patrol in the night. He duly informs Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) who takes over and orders Sam to keep a check on some usual notorious places. Sam finds a black man with a fat purse waiting to get on a train. Coming from a racist southern town, Sam duly hauls the black man to the station without even questioning him marking him as a prime suspect. When the chief finds the black man Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) to be a police officer from North and that too one of the best Homicide experts, he reluctantly requests his help in turn mounting the wrath of the town on him. \n\nIt is a movie with extreme highs and a moderate lows. While the conversations between Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier are electrifying, the general behavior of the town is provocative and many external plot elements inducing the required urgency for a thriller, the general progression of the central plot is hampered by a leisure screenplay and too many distractions. The climax revelation needed to be a lot more intelligent given the buildup. Rod Steiger's Academy win is one the most unconventional and well deserved I have come across. Apart from Rod Steiger, Sidney Poitier and briefly by Lee Grant and Larry Gates, the host of other supporting characters performances were too ordinary. \nSome of the memorable scenes that impressed me \n1) Tibbs consoling Mrs. Colbert \n2) Tibbs altercation with Endicott and Chief Gillespie's response to that. \n3) Chief Gillespie's personal confession about loneliness \n4) Climax parting scene \n\nThe complex premise and masterful performances elevates the simple dull plot",

This is yet another forgotten classic which gets its head right and message straight. This is the story of a town that refuses to change in a time where Hollywood perhaps had its most phenomenal changes from the ultra conventional styles.",

Sidney Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphia homicide detective who gets stranded in Sparta, MS, after being apprehended as a murder suspect (racism) and then asked to help out (but not really - racism again).  Rod Steiger plays the new Chief who has to overcome his own redneck impulses while trying to stifle the racist tendencies of his force and the local townspeople.  Of course, Poitier solves the crime (despite being misled at one point by his own tendency to suspect rich white racists); however, this isn't really the focus of the film (i.e., I'm not sure the facts of the case lead easily to the real killer).  Nevertheless, the political points made here are still well worth it (try if you wish to substitute a Muslim cop into the Poitier role and see how it plays out in your head).  Norman Jewison does an OK job directing, although some elements feel a bit schematic and the score by Quincy Jones is dated (sound and use). But you can always rely on Warren Oates!",

            "content": "Sparta, Mississippi is a homely little town. It's small, desolate, and drenched with unbearable heat.  The citizens are self-serving.  The picturesque advertisements that paint the faces of the middling businesses are deceiving.  At times, the town resembles something out of a '60s teen romance film, a quaint but calm setting that lets love grown on trees.  But like in \"Twin Peaks,\" there is a labyrinth of an underground that takes the wholesome Coca-Cola posters and white swing-sets and knots them into a dirty, unsightly torrent of dust and hatred. \n\tWhen a prominent entrepreneur is murdered, his body discarded in an alleyway, the town's police force doesn't know what to do with the case.  Most people have mutually decided to mind their own business, only to join forces when an unwanted visitor makes their way into the isolated bubble that is Sparta.  Murder was hush hush before.  Bodies being dumped in the middle of the street is something completely new to the citizens.  \nChief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) orders his staff to search the area, looking for anyone who may have seen or heard something, or, simply looks guilty.  One officer finds an African-American man (Sidney Poitier) sitting alone in a train station; Sparta, being the brewery of racial tension that it is, doesn't ask any questions when he is arrested purely on the basis of his skin color.\n\tBut once he arrives at the police station, he makes a fool out of everyone; he introduces himself as Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphian homicide detective that is merely passing through the town to catch an upcoming train to Memphis.  He wants nothing more than to leave, but his chief orders him to stay and aid the investigation.  Gillespie has never known anything other than bigotry, but he is suddenly forced to push his personal views aside and follow the duties of a policeman.  Tibbs, meanwhile, has to continuously defend himself from the prejudiced people of Sparta, some of whom are viciously violent when it comes to keeping the status quo in check.\n\tIn 1967, the social climate of America was drastically changing.  After years of fighting for equality, blacks were finally getting the respect they deserved, even if that process was more gradual than it should have been.  Varying cultures were beginning to have more opportunity than ever.\n\tBut then, there were towns like Sparta, buried in the deep South.  In the middle-of-nowhere and completely separated from the open-mindedness of the big cities, the Spartas of America didn't want and perhaps weren't aware of the changes that were being made in society.  \"In the Heat of the Night\" remains so important because it's both a steadfast look into the ugliness of prejudice and a snapshot of a transitioning world.\n\tBeneath all the sweat, snarling animosity, and tumbleweeds, there is a triumphant truth to every single scene.  All his life, Bill Gillespie was taught that African-Americans were underneath him, him being a superior, mighty being.  But when Tibbs comes onto the scene, we can see a newfound flicker in his eyes.  He wants to scream and shout the most appalling things imaginable and put down his newfound colleague in the same way he has treated the black citizens of Sparta.  Yet, he can't.  Tibbs is a better man and a better detective.  He's a hell of a lot smarter than he is, too.  In just a matter of days, a realization hits Gillespie unexpectedly.  Maybe, just maybe, no race is more sophisticated than the other.  Maybe.  \n\tThe fact that, less than 50 years ago, cities were still as racist as Sparta is stunningly maddening.  But Tibbs and Gillespie's relationship represents something more than just two guys attempting to get along.  The film represents something more too.  Take away the mystery, the formal vocations, and the suits, and you get a full view of a predominantly white society finally understanding the wrongs of their past.  As hesitant as they may be in terms of correcting them automatically, there's a knowledge that going on with such discrimination will be venomous, a severe death wish on every person in the room.\n\tPoitier and Steiger are absolutely excellent.  They are capable foils that bounce off each other with ceaseless energy.  Poitier is electric, stoic and utterly powerful; the scene in which he slaps a small-minded plantation owner is totally sensational.  Steiger is extremely fascinating to watch - he isn't your average movie bigot, as there is a lurking variable that fuels his hate more than mere racism.  \n\"In the Heat of the Night\" is Southern-fried and completely without boundaries.  It's an above average detective film, but beneath its whodunit tropes lays a scathing commentary that still remains relevant.",
