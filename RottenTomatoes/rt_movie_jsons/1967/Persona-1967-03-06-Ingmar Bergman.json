I am not going to analyze or explain this film. I will leave that to YouTube. Compared to The Seventh Seal, which was a more existential film, Persona is extremely ambitious making it hard to decipher the reality of its characters. I loved this film and only makes me want to experience more of Ingmar Bergman's filmmaking.",

Persona is beautifully shot in black and white and the performances of Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson are honestly flawless. Ingmar Bergman creates a story thats intriguing throughout the whole movie and will leave you scratching your head by the end of the movie, especially with the big reveal at the end. Persona really is a movie, that you need to see a couple of times, to fully understand whats going on and what the message behind it is and for that reason I was lost at some parts of the movie. The movie immediatly opens with an abstract scene, where we get answers to, at the end of the movie, however this might be my fault, but I still didnt fully understand on what was going on by the end of the movie, yet in Persona's case I think its a good thing, as long as the rest of the movie was understandble. Persona is definitely a movie that is in need for a rewatch somewhere in the future, however I am first going to start with an essay about the ending and an interview of Ingmar Bergman on what his message behind the movie is!",

            "content": "I consider myself to be a film scholar and my favourite film is \"Persona\" which was released in 1966. \"Persona\" is a Swedish psychological drama film written and directed by Ingmar Bergman and starring Bibi Andersson and liv Ullman. This film both fascinates and hypnotizes and leaves the viewer with a lot of questions and a lust to watch it again and again. This is not a film, but a real masterpiece.\nBergman called \"Persona\" the most important film of his career. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma which swallows you completely, with its symbolism in the first shot telling a story in pictures, using the language of associations.\nA boy is abandoned by his mother and his mother suffers from her inability to love him. It is pure theatre, where all the action is set in just two locations - a hospital and a house on the coast.\nThe director examines the personality of the actor in which lies and truth are indistinguishable. Every gesture is false and every smile is a grimace. It is filmed as a monologue with the plot built around two women - one of them is a famous actress patient and other is a nurse taking care of the first: The famous stage actress, Elisabet Volgler who has suddenly stopped speaking and is able to pronounce only two phrases in the entire film and; Alma her nurse, who is in a dialogue with herself.\nA static camera. Two characters interacting actively through tantrums. Conflicts and physical contact. Andersson and Ullmann´s acting is impeccable, the camera work superb. Everything has meaning and significance. There is no empty dialogue and no special effects. Raw.\nFor me, this is a film about the fear of being oneself and the necessity to comply with social conventions. Everybody plays a role, adopting masks and eventually thereby loses their inner selves. Pain, fear, despair and lies occupy human life and the inability to stop, fall silent, live and realize each simple step taken and to allow oneself to be seen by others, is what make us people.\nI would highly recommend \"Persona\", especially if you are keen on classic cinema.",

            "content": "Akin to psychological torture, another one by Bergman that is scarier than most horror films out there. I didn't like how vague the film was, although I'm sure that was the point. Was Bergman a genius? Yes, that's obvi he was ahead of his time but just bc someone is an artist doesn't mean I will like the art. There were parts of the film that were brilliant (some of the monologue/dream like sequences), but as a whole no just no. The ending just sucked and left u with so many questions rather than answers. I thought the film was trying to say that it was the actress's imagination of the nurse figure, but I don't think so. I think she wanted to feel like this lady did and was kind of a succubus. Someone who makes her living pretending to have all these emotions, who really is empty inside, esp when it comes to being a mother. The nurse also was pretending to be this kind person with a purpose in life, when really, she just seemed like a lost soul. In one particular disturbing scene, she describes a sexual encounter involving pedophilia with young boys very explicitly. The actress lady remains quite throughout film, although very expressive at certain parts. She pretends at first to be the nurse's friend, but it become obvious she is just using her for her next acting role/study. The actress wants to hear the nurse's deepest, dark secrets and silently judge her. Towards the end, the nurse becomes almost psychotic wanting the actress to speak to her and befriend her or make meaning of all that she has told her. She gives up and realizes the great actress who she first admires is an empty person and will always be. After this realization, she seems to separate herself from her after one last weird encounter and the film ends. Artistically, (cinematography and editing wise) it is great. However, even though I like dark films, I'm not crazy about this genre (avant-garde and French new wave) and it was too dark even for me. I can't rate it higher than what I did, altho considered a masterpiece, I didn't really enjoy it.",

It's the story of Elisabet (Liv Ullmann), a stage actress who inexplicably stops speaking.  Alma (Bibi Andersson), an inexperienced nurse, is given the difficult assignment of tending to the needs of the patient. When released from the hospital, Alma escorts her patient to a remote seaside cottage where the treatment is to continue.  The film evolves into an avant garde cinematic experience, unlike anything Bergman had previously attempted.  What does it all mean?  That is more or less left up to the audience.  With the passage of time, many consider Persona to be Bergman's crowning glory, a claim that is certainly debatable.  Regardless, it's a powerful film with remarkable performances from both Ullmann and Andersson, a film that will be worshipped by most and vilified by some…and neither would be wrong.",

            "content": "Persona is one of Ingmar Bergman's most highly acclaimed films, and the first of his I've ever seen, though I'd been planning on watching one of his movies for some time. You can tell from the opening that its going be artsy and unconventional, and random snippets of choppily edited extraneous footage that pop up throughout reinforce this notion. The film is subject to so much interpretation and scrutiny that essays and even entire books have been written about it, and as such its not the kind of film for a relaxed, easy-going experience. My takeaway was that of a message of self-examination. A young nurse is tasked with caring for an actress who is either unwilling or unable to speak, and finds great comfort and security in imparting her stories and thoughts upon her, but when none of this can be reciprocated, she becomes increasingly unstable. There's evidence to suggest that none of the events onscreen are actually happening, or they may actually be staged for a film or TV series, but I think Bergman's intention was to keep everything as ambiguous as possible, right down to his extensive use of close ups, not allowing us to see much of the big picture, so to speak. Its clearly intended to be analysed more than enjoyed, and in that case it's difficult to recommend to someone who doesn't plan on writing a thesis when the film is done. But for what it is, I liked the earnest performances, the often-shocking dialogue, the imagery and its boldness. A must see for any movie buff or Bergman aficionado.",

Though she no longer speaks she still writes, she still thinks, and most importantly she still loves. And the lie is revealed when Nurse Alma threatens to throw the bucket of boiling water on her. For all Elizabet's withdrawal, she still can't escape the fact that she is alive, and thus is scared to be harmed. So, she talks. And that brings us to the second human dilemma featured in this movie. As the doctor described it: \"the hopeless dream of being\". Elizabet's tragedy comes from her efforts to frame her existence in her own fantasies. She wants to be a mother even though her own nature opposes it. But, she tries to shape her being and chooses to become a mother anyway. And therein lies the \"hopeless dream\". She wants to be the master of her own being but she inevitably can't. Then she tries to escape her being and she inevitably can't. She refuses to accept the one certainty in life: we are.",

It is deeply emotional and features some cinema's most haunting imagery. Ingmar Bergman uses the lookalike actresses to mesmerize his audience with parallel images, quick cuts to unnerving visuals, and even dissolving film reels to upend all your preconceived notions of how a film should play out. \n\nBergman's direction is immaculate and thought provoking starting with a fearsome montage and diving straight into the uneasy feelings of an actress who never wants to speak again. Bergman goes out of his way to make Liv Ullman and Bibi Andersson look eerily alike. From their stances, hair, outfits, movements, and speak, Bergman uses the camera to create a false mirror of his actress with stunning effect.\n\nPersona is as much a wild cinematic experiment in form, structure, and narrative as it is a harrowing drama between to similar ladies.\n\nPersona is in a class all its own. It takes Bergman's script that ruminates and relates to the fears and insecurities of modern women and their sensitivities. Anything from love, marriage, childbirth, infidelity, abortion, to threesomes is fair game to Persona. I think Bergman's writing is commendable for genuinely trying to empathize with how a woman feels. Persona is so human and fragile, yet fiercely striking at the same time.\n\nAs the title implies, Persona gives us a new face to view as it reveals the front we put on to appear normal in society. Bergman takes all the facade away and leaves us with the raw emotions of two unhappy women that desperately crave something more. I found Persona even more poignant and lonely that when I first was awestruck by the experience of watching Persona.\n\nBergman uses the suspenseful sequencing to build up tension exponentially so that the viewer never knows what will happen next in Persona. It's incredible that Persona only runs for 83 minutes and manages to tell a full story with two highly complex characters that feel completely fleshed out in such a short time span.\n\nFurthermore, Lars Johan Werle's shocking and atmospheric score keeps you on edge while gazing upon Persona. The sudden sounds blare up out of nowhere always getting a surprised expression from me. Persona uses dissonant sound design as beautifully as Ulla Ryghe's unorthodox edits.\n\nSimilarly, I have to admire and appreciate the cinematography of Persona. Bergman's eye for unique shots and perspectives in Persona cannot be overstated. Sven Nykvist's cinematography on the beach sequence with Liv Ullman chasing down Bibi Andersson with an extended long panning shot is so beautiful and captivating. You never want to look away from Persona as intriguing shot after shot occurs. The melding of both actresses in the mirror image is honestly the greatest visual metaphor in film history. \n\nI also have to mention Bergman repeating Ullman's final monologue first from Bibi's reaction to Liv's speech. The over the shoulder perspective is particularly clever and revealing for the characters.\n\nFinally, I will state that Persona features perhaps the greatest lead and supporting actress performances in cinematic memory. Liv Ullman is adorable and endearing as the well meaning nurse Alma. Her tender affection for Bibi Andersson's famous actress Elisabet Vogler is palpable due to Ullman's strong acting. Ullman brings a hypnotic allure to Persona as she pours her heart out scene after scene with captivating results. Her massive monologue admitting to a threesome is mesmerizing for its dreamlike quality and horrifying for how emotionally damaging it feels. Ullman delivers the finest performance of her career and the shining standard of Swedish acting in Persona.\n\nLikewise, Bibi Andersson's silent role in Persona is as entrancing as she keeps you staring at her eyes and mouth for the entirety of Persona. She never really have to say anything to convey a lifetime of unhappiness and depression. Andersson's roles are normally quite talkative, so Persona is a unique chance for her to demonstrate how to act with a subtle knowing with mostly her facial cues and expressions. You just need to sit back and get lost in Andersson's eyes while viewing Persona. She will tell you all you need to know.\n\nIn conclusion, Persona is simply the best Swedish cinema has to offer. It remains one of my favorite films of all time, my favorite Ingmar Bergman film, and one of the most important and influential films ever directed. Persona has to be seen and experienced at least once before you die. Behold Bergman's mastery of the camera lens and the written word. Persona is magnificent!",

            "content": "3/5\nDecades after avant garde painting abandoned traditional representation, Bergman did the same thing with movies. He decided that a film could exist without conventional elements of plot and setting. And he could throw in an ambiguous pre-credit sequence with several grotesque images and irritating drip noises, and invite everyone to attempt to interpret it all. \nElizabeth and Alma, mute actress and her nurse, a strong silent personality and a weaker one who is provoked into never ending introspection by her patient. Bergman does all kinds of photographic tricks to combine them into one person, hence the singular nature of the film's title. He has one stand in front of the other, with the head of one superimposed on the other's body. He shows one so out of focus that you're not sure which is there, except for the darker hair. He actually merges their faces. The beautifully stark and high contrast black and white photography was essential, so that the two of them could superficially look similarly dressed - assonance, more than rhyme. Color would have gotten in the way.\nElizabeth is disturbed by a burning Buddhist monk in Vietnam, and a photograph from the Warsaw ghetto. I found that pretty superficial. What I found extraordinary were the creative uses of light. Alma opens a window for Elizabeth, so she can witness dusk. The light fades with her eyes open, and there's just enough reflection in her pupils so that two pinholes of white remain after everything else has gone dark. There are a lot of moments like that, which save this film.\nI don't know if there was some kind of transference, or if this is a reverse Sybil film - one personality depicted by multiple actresses. It doesn't matter. The interpretation exercise is just as important as the film. My biggest quibble? Alma's monologues were vapid and annoying. They invite ridicule. They reminded me of summaries that detectives give at the end of murder mysteries, interpreting the killer's motivations. I also hate emotionally distraught people (read: teenagers) who refuse to speak when you've begged them to.",

Elisabet Vogler is a famous actress but has suddenly become apathetic, lethargic, mute and prone to fits of laughter at arbitrary, innocuous things.  Alma does her best to engage Elisabet and get her to talk but the more Alma opens up to Elisabet, the more she empathises with her and becomes like her.\n\nWritten and directed by famed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, Persona is a superb, mind-bending study on identity and personality.  Well, to me it is, mostly.  Every time I thought I had the movie figured out, it would take a different tack.  \n\nReading what movie critics and psychologists think it is about, there isn't a single, unifying interpretation.  So, if you say you know exactly what it is about - you're either lying or weren't concentrating.  Basically, every person will have their own interpretation, dependant largely on their own background and perceptions.  Isn't that the definition of art?\n\nAnd it certainly feels like art.  Bergman's cinematography is excellent, the soundtrack adds to the intensity and he uses symbolism extensively, and jarringly (maybe a tad overused - I didn't find it all necessary).  Liv Ullman's minimalist performance - she utters only two words during the course of the movie - and the psychological aspects, especially, add to the sense of this being something more than just a movie.  Quite profound, even without knowing what the profundities are (!).\n\nI found it difficult to give this a 10, due to not understanding it fully (and believe me, I tried!) and feeling like I could have done with a more complete conclusion.

There were ups-and-downs and I wanted to know what would happen next. The characters were totally engaging, and the actresses were excellent. Then it all went to insanity again. Logic and plot no longer reigned, and Persona devolved into a piece of abstract art. Time and space seemed to have no meaning, things were staged in an odd way and I wasn’t sure if anything was real any more. I can see the artistry in the film-making and I think the acting was strong even in these crazy scenes, but I hate this kind of chaos.

            "content": "An avant-garde opening sequence of images, some disturbing, immediately sets the tone for this movie, as Bergman seems to say he will challenge us with 'Persona'.   The story is relatively straightforward, but discerning what's reality may be a little challenging.  As with many (all?) of Bergman's films, the script is fantastic, with real weight to it, and it's a cerebral film.  \n\nOstensibly, an actor (Liv Ullman) has had an existential crisis while on the stage and suddenly stops speaking.  It seems to be because of her feelings of the falseness of life (and indeed, 'Persona' in Latin means 'mask'), heightened by events in the world (we see a film clip of a Buddhist monk in Vietnam who set fire to himself in protest of the war, as well as a picture of Nazis holding guns on women and children).   She withdraws from her husband and young son.  Doctors can find nothing wrong with her mentally or physically, and put her in the care of a young nurse (Bibi Andersson), who takes her to the seaside.  Andersson has almost all of the lines in the film, talking to Ullman about her own life in quite candid terms, both about a sexual adventure she once had on the beach (which is quite graphically described!), falling in love with a married man, and her guilt over getting an abortion, but Ullman does a good job with her part, conveying a lot with just her facial expressions. \n\nAs the story plays out, Andersson gets a little unhinged herself, and the two then start to mingle together, either in their thoughts and dreams or possibly in reality.    In one fantastic sequence, the reason for Ullman's guilt about not easily assuming the role of motherhood is revealed, shot first with tight shots of her face as Andersson speaks, and then shown again, verbatim, with the camera on Andersson.   There is a doubling here, and Bergman emphasizes it with this sequence.  \n\nThe movie can be interpreted in different ways which makes it interesting, but it's not so far out there that you won't take anything away from it at all; Bergman seems to get the balance right on that front.  He takes us to a beautiful place - the seaside - and includes fantastic shots such as the one of Andersson looking at her reflection in a small pond, and later following Ullman down a long stretch of the shore - and yet also tells us things are not always what they seem.   His ending will have you thinking, for example, whether all of this has been a dialogue within one person's mind.   But even as we're unsure of 'reality', I found it empowering to women, who discuss philosophy, acknowledge their sexuality, and acknowledge what is perhaps even a bigger taboo - that assuming the role of motherhood is sometimes very difficult.   And, in a larger sense, he signals that even though the world is beautiful, to exist in it can be horrifying.  We're all ultimately alone, but must hold on to one another as best we can.\n\nSome quotes...\nOn marriage:\n\"You've taught me that we must see each other as two anxious children full of goodwill and the best of intentions but governed by forces we can only partially control.\"\n\nOn existential crises:\n\"You think I don't understand?  The hopeless dream of being.  Not seeming to be, but being.  Conscious and awake at every moment.  At the same time, the chasm between what you are to others and what you are to yourself.  The feeling of vertigo, and the constant hunger to be unmasked once and for all.  To be seen through, cut down...perhaps even annihilated.  Every tone of voice a lie, every gesture a falsehood, every smile a grimace.  Commit suicide?  No, too nasty.  One doesn't do things like that.  But you can refuse to move or talk.  Then at least you're not lying.  You can cut yourself off, close yourself in.  Then you needn't play any roles, wear any masks, make any false gestures.    So you might think...but reality plays nasty tricks on you.  Your hiding place isn't watertight enough.  Life oozes in from all sides.  You're forced to react.  No one asks whether it's genuine or not, whether you're lying or telling the truth.  Questions like that only matter in the theater, and hardly even there.  I understand you, Elisabet.\"\n\nAnd this one, quoted from a book Andersson is reading on the beach:\n\"All the anxiety we carry within us, all our thwarted dreams, the inexplicable cruelty, our fear of extinction, the painful insight into our earthly condition have slowly crystallized our hope for an other-worldly salvation.  The tremendous cry of our faith and doubt against the darkness and the silence is the most terrifying proof of our abandonment and our terrified and unuttered knowledge.\"",

She's wonderful. 99% of the dialogue in the movie comes from her, but she still paints a fascinating portrait of the nurse. Every story she tells, every moment from her past, rings with emotional honesty.\n\nThat being said, there are a few... for lack of a better word... really weird things about this film. The beginning is quite bizarre: a film reel showing brief flashes of various images, including a penis and a tarantula, flash by and we open on a boy waking up to read a novel and watch an image of our two actresses merge into one. While it's not hard to see what Bergman was going for, the images during the main part of the story manage to convey the same meaning much more effectively. Of particular note is the scene where we see the same scene twice: once from Ullmann's perspective, then again from Andersson's.\n\nOverall, it's a really interesting movie. It features two fantastic performances that really stay with you, but at times it got a little too weird for its own good.",

            "content": "This time through Bergman's Persona left me a little cold.  Perhaps I wasn't quite in the mood for its experimental approach to analyzing human relationships and needs that depicts a steadfast denial of verbal communication from one party.  That said, I fully appreciate the magnitude of Bergman's achievement here.  I found an old review (circa 1990s) and I include an edited excerpt here:  \nThe film opens with a montage of images (a bare lightbulb, various cinematography equipment, corpses in a morgue, a young boy reading and then reaching up to touch a giant image of Liv Ullman/Bibi Andersson) that clearly evokes the idea that we  are about to watch a \"film\"--there is even a a portion of the \"leader\" before a film begins. Then, the movie turns to traditional narrative structure. A young nurse (Andersson) is assigned to the case of an actress who has decided to become mute. I say decided because it is made explicit that there is no clear psychological or physical ailment that has caused the muteness. Nevertheless, the nurse is assigned to care for the actress (Ullman). Even from the start, the nurse is worried that she might not have the psychological strength/stamina to handle this odd case--she should have listened to her inner voices.  After a short time, the head of the sanatorium decides that the nurse and the patient should remove themselves to a country house to improve the treatment. Once  there, the nurse becomes incredibly voluble--as anyone would when faced with a silent companion. She begins to reveal intimate details of her life, and although I perceived her to be a pleasant and un-self-analytical person at first, she begins to express doubts and anxieties. Since these are met with resounding silence, she becomes flustered. When she reads an unsealed letter by Ullman that mocks her and defines her as an object for study, she begins to get resentful. Throughout all this, Ullman gives a masterful performance of reserved observation and occasional emotion. The focus is upon Andersson and the changes she must go through  because of her contact with this willful mute. Much has been made of the \"reversal of personality\" that takes place. Andersson becomes much more cynical and \nalienated but, for me, there is not too much evidence that Ullman is significantly altered by her contact with Andersson. We do learn, after they part, that Ullman \nreturned to her stage career--and she does seem more connected to life and the real world, but she fails to speak more than a word (when forced) throughout the \nfilm. Needless to say, Andersson breaks down as a result of this \"silent treatment\" and Bergman evokes this by having the film itself break in the middle and the  images become much more experimental and bizarre toward the end of the movie. \n\nSeveral themes became apparent to me during my watching of this film.  For example, \"life as theater\". Many images and much of the dialogue in the film reveals Bergman's conception that life is predominantly acting. First of all, Ullman is an actress herself and she is plainly \"studying\" Andersson, perhaps for use in a future role. The fact that the film is obvious about the fact that it IS a film makes us aware that these self-presentations have been designed for us ( much like everyday self-presentations?). A documentary style (in which one person is never shown during a conversation) makes an appearance early in the film, making our spectator status even more obvious. Later when the style switches to intensely personal, we are unable to shake this conception of the \"objective\" portrayal of reality--although clearly many images are parts of dreams (but even Andersson is unsure of their status as reality/unreality). Regardless, the film portrays human motives for behavior as largely designed to create a certain impression/identity. Ullman is accused of having a child to counteract a general perception of her as unmotherly, but Andersson, too, seems to be fighting the desire to maintain a helpful \"persona\" required of a nurse despite resenting her patient. This forces us to ponder from whence our desired identities come from--from within? from others' impressions of us (the looking glass self)? an interaction of the two? One scene even features a camera which exemplifies this construction of impressions theme. In the same way, the nurse's seeming \nintense need for feedback from Ullman provides clues as to just how important other people's responses are for our own identities.\n\nBut it gets much more complicated than that. If life is merely shadows played out on a stage, then what is the role of honesty or sincerity? This evokes Sartre's concept of bad faith, basically the state of acting as though you have a certain motive or certain types of knowledge when in fact \nyou have very different motives or knowledge that might call such action into question or at least complicate it. Sartre uses the (sexist) example of the woman who allows her hand to be held, pretending that all is innocent and declaiming such when asked, despite really knowing that her male escort will take it as a sign that affection is assured. Bergman plays on this theme by having the nurse explicitly ask whether there can be two selves: one that does certain things and another that is one's general impression of oneself that does not allow for such actions (the nurse has engaged in an orgy spontaneously but still thinks of herself as faithful to her lover who was not involved). What is to be done and thought when \"ideas don't tally with acts\"? This is a state we all must be in if we treat life as theatre and those who are actors even more so. Thus, Ullman's retreat into reticence is framed as an escape from the continual lying of her career (and our existence). If we are all  constantly in bad faith, how must this be dealt with? When Ullman realizes it, she becomes mute. When Andersson begins to realize it, she becomes somewhat insane. To what standard must we hold ourselves? When are we allowed to be inconsistent?\n\nOn top of all this, the film is laced with horror film type imagery that evokes a constant forboding--lots of eerie closeups and dreamlike black and white \ncinematography ( I should mention Sven Nykvist). Overall, an intense and thought provoking picture.\"\n\nNot much more to add to that!",

The mind games at play in this relatively short film are key to this movie, and it makes the film a disturbing look at psychology and reality.\n\nI have to say that I am not a fan of the idea of Persona as an \"art\" film. The montages at the opening and closing of this film do not necessarily make sense of the images used, though it can be taken at the ending that the boy shown could be Vogler's son. I usually prefer a good narrative when it comes to film, though non- traditional narratives like The Tree of Life can be intriguing as well. I just did not find too much meaning or content in these montages within Persona.\n\nIt is very interesting the way the two leads seem to represent two halves of a whole, though I do not agree with the fact that Bergman was going for the idea that the two women look very similar; I can distinguish them very easily. However, there is a brilliant image formed by half of each character's face, and it is manipulated in a way to show the two are one in the same. I am astounded by this effect and wish I knew how it was achieved because it is very interesting and is definitely at the core of the film.\n\nI love films that deal with psychology at its core, and I think that is why I am intrigued by this film on a second viewing.

Persona was a film that initially caused feelings of disappointment, leaving me in a state of confusion and frustration due to the film's, at the time, ambiguous and complex themes. I finally decided to give this film another attempt, unexpectedly surprising me in the process; a film that tackles complicated but well-executed themes, rewarding those who give the film the concentration it deserves.\n\nThe closer we are to somebody, the more we are able to understand them, eventually being able to speak for them as one could easily anticipate how the other would feel about it. I have had many friends that I have gained a close relationship with, and as time passes together, we unconsciously become much more aware of one another, revealing shades of ourselves without even noticing; becoming more and more of a single unit. Persona deals with the same idea, but it brings the unconscious elements right to the surface, and I think because of that I felt distant from the film, as at the time I was not yet very aware of it and therefore could not empathise with the filmmaker's intentions. In Persona we have two women, one a nurse (Alma) and the other a suddenly turned mute actress (Elisabet Vogler), accommodating an isolated home. This sense of isolation in itself creates a tight, almost claustrophobic atmosphere, pushing its characters close together, to the point where it feels like they are dependent on one another to avoid feelings of loneliness and boredom.\n\nThis close proximity has naturally changed Alma's initial intentions, which was to provide care for Elisabet, and grow into the territory of friendship. Alma then begins to share about her life, and Elisabet there willing to listen. Elisabet's true agenda is revealed later in the film, accompanied with deep and subtle exposition that speaks volume of the character and the film's profound themes. The film shows a close representation of an actress' ability to find and insert herself into a role, showing how far it could go, potentially consuming one's personal life. Elisabet is a person who is in dire need of an escape from her domestic situation. Bergman brings a surreal quality to the way Elisabet transfer herself into Alma, relying on conscious cinematic techniques.\n\nThere are still some aspects of the film that I have yet been able to penetrate, but this is a film that requires deep attention and repeated viewings in order to shed its layers. Persona is an almost perfect film that displays Bergman at his most intimately ambitious, telling a tight and quiet story, paired with haunting and thought-provoking imagery.",

This was yet another Bergman movie that seemed to defy logic, focusing more on creating vivid images and swirling around thought-provoking themes without telling a straightforward story. But while there are scenes in Hour of the Wolf and Passion of Anna that are confusing and don't really seem to serve a purpose in the narrative, with this movie, it seemed like the confusion was part of the narrative. It seemed like something I should be understanding, on a thematic level if not a literal one. As a result, I feel a bit at a loss; I feel like I should be grasping these themes more easily, and instead I'm fixating too much on the literal, even though I know that's not what matters. I think I need to rewatch the movie.\n\nSo: despite my frustration at not fully 'getting it,' there are parts that I really liked. The whole first half is pretty coherent and makes sense, ignoring the disturbing opening montage; it's relatively straightforward until the screen suddenly shatters, characters switch places, intense psychological warfare is waged, and the camera crew again breaks the fourth wall.\n\nHonestly, I feel like it's ignorant of me to write much more or even try to dissect the idea of 'personas' in the movie without rewatching or taking a close look at the movie again, so I'll just say this: there were, as always, some lovely images and camerawork, both with the subliminal-ish images in the montages to the tender moments between Alma and Elisabeth to the moment when Alma purposely leaves out the glass for Elisabeth to step on. There's a darkness that pervades the film, and it's clear that not everything is as it seems.

I'm not sure how much of that is due to Bergman and how much to his cinematographer; I'm guessing they both deserve the credit. Actually the whole movie has beautiful cinematography; there's some marvelous shots in this movie, several of which are no doubt iconic. It also doesn't hurt to have two great actresses to work with, Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann are both wonderful, and are long time collaborators with Bergman; I'm looking forward to check out more in his filmography.",

It's not exactly light-hearted viewing, but it's made endlessly rewarding through Bergman's engaging treatises on identity, performance, art and filmmaking, and Sven Nykvist's starkly beautiful cinematography.

The film can be desribed as an intricate study of the human identity, our ambiguity, the frailty of our psyches, and also, could be considered with his other film studies of human isolation. The story begins with an actress, Elizabeth Vogler, being sent to an isolated island by her psychiatrist, because she has quit speaking, and a nurse, Alma, is assigned to take care of her. From the beginning you can tell that these two have some sort of connection, despite their being complete opposites; Elizabeth is cold and dark, she alienates herself from the world, because she sees no need to associate with a meaningless and suffering world. While Alma is a ray of sunlight, she's an ardent optimist who can't help but see meaning in everything because she loves life. And from there Bergman creates a hypnotic, spiralling psychological thriller that keeps you guessing until the end, while also giving you a beautiful discourse on the human condition. This is also one of Bergman's more visually artistic and stunning films, which only contributes more to the hypnotic feeling that his marvelous screenplay intiates. Persona could very well be compared to Psycho in terms of themes, however, Persona would be more like a study of what drove Norman Bates to do these things, instead of the horror of his actions.

            "content": "PERSONA may well be Ingmar Bergman's most complex film, yet, like many Bergman films, the story it tells is superficially simple. Actress Elizabeth Volger has suddenly stopped speaking in what appears to be an effort to cease all communication with the external world. She is taken to a hospital, where nurse Alma is assigned to care for her. After some time, Elisabeth's doctor feels the hospital is of little use to her; the doctor accordingly lends her seaside home to Elisabeth, who goes there with Alma in attendance. Although Elisabeth remains silent, the relationship between the women is a pleasant one--until a rainy day, too much alcohol, and Elisabeth's silence drives Alma into a series of highly charged personal revelations.\nIt is at this point that the film, which has already be super-saturated with complex visual imagery, begins to create an unnerving and deeply existential portrait of how we interpret others, how others interpret us, and the impact that these interpretations have upon both us and them. What at first seemed fond glances and friendly gestures from the silent Elisabeth are now suddenly open to different interpretations, and Alma--feeling increasingly trapped by the silence--enters into a series of confrontations with her patient... but these confrontations have a dreamlike quality, and it becomes impossible to know if they are real or imagined--and if imagined, in which of the women's minds the fantasy occurs. Ultimately, Bergman seems to be creating a situation in which we are forced to acknowledge that a great deal of what we believe we know about each other rests largely upon what we ourselves project upon them. Elisabeth's face and its expressions become akin to a blank screen on which we see our own hopes, dreams, torments, and tragedies projected--while the person behind the face constantly eludes our understanding. In this respect, the theme is remarkably well-suited to its medium: the blankness of the cinema screen with its flickering, endless shifting images that can be interpreted in infinite ways.  Bergman seems to be stating that we cannot know another person, and that our inability to know is our greatest tragedy. But however the film is interpreted, it is a stunning and powerful achievement, one that will resonate with the viewer long after the film ends.",

            "content": "Even Ingmar Bergman Had to Live Through the Sixties  \r\n\r\nIt's not that Bergman wasn't always experimental in one way or another.  However, most of how he experimented was storytelling.  In this film, he spends time experimenting with imagery in a way that seems very dated to me.  I think he was a bit ahead of the curve with some of how he did things, though most of the film of that decade that I actually watch is considerably more mainstream and less experimental overall.  To be perfectly blunt, visually experimental films tend to bore me.  I feel that, in general, they don't put enough effort into things like plot and characterization.  Of course, that wasn't the case with Bergman, because he was always interested in plot and characterization.  However, the jumble of images that starts the movie triggers something of a kneejerk reaction from me.  It reminds me of too many movies that were all like that; part of Bergman's mastery was in understanding that you couldn't do that for ninety minutes.\r\n\r\nOne evening, while performing the role of Electra, Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) fell silent for an entire minute, explaining when she got offstage that she had been seized with a near-irresistible impulse to laugh hysterically.  The next day, when the theatre called to find out why she hadn't come in for rehearsal, they found out that she was in bed neither moving nor talking.  She was sent to the care of a doctor (Margaretha Krook), who made a series of psychological pronouncements and sent her to the doctor's own summer house by the sea along with a nurse, Alma (Bibi Andersson).  Alma is younger, inexperienced, and engaged to a man with whom she does not appear to be in love.  She fills Elisabeth's silence with a torrent of words, revealing things she had never spoken of before because she fears the silence more than she fears showing herself.  In her words, she also begins to reveal Elisabeth.\r\n\r\nIt's not completely accurate to refer to Alma as inexperienced, of course, as one of the film's most famous scenes makes quite clear.  One day, while on vacation with her fiancé, she and a friend had sexual contact with a pair of strange teenage boys whom she never saw again.  It is a story she has never told before, and one rather suspects that she didn't even talk about it with the friend.  When she tells the story to Elisabeth, I suspect that at least half of it is that she needs to stay the words aloud, to make the story real in her own head.  Another part of it is doubtless a belief, perhaps unconscious, that surely [i]this[/i] will make Elisabeth talk, but she isn't completely talking to Elisabeth anyway.  She is talking to herself, and Elisabeth is the silence into which she drops her words.  She is, however, a responsive silence, something more than just saying the words to herself in an empty room.  Alma uses Elisabeth to make the experience of her past real to her, because she has shared it with someone else.\r\n\r\nBecause Elisabeth does not talk, we cannot know how much of her Alma is actually managing to reveal.  She has a long monologue about Elisabeth's reaction to pregnancy and childbirth, and from mere facial expressions, it seems that what she says is true.  However, because we do not and cannot get Elisabeth's version of the story, it is possible that she is in fact upset that someone would think that of her.  It is possible that she thought that, silence or no, Alma ought to have known her better.  They have been spending all their time together for weeks at that point, and completely alone at that.  Either Alma found her way inside Elisabeth's mind or she didn't.  Either Elisabeth is hurt by Alma's revelations because of their truth or because of their falsehood.  We don't know, and we will never know.  In fact, it's an interesting question as to whether Ingmar Bergman himself knew if it was true or not.  I assume he did; he seems to be that kind of person.  But of course we can no longer know that, either.\r\n\r\nWhatever causes Elisabeth's silence, there is little to be done about it.  It isn't anything physical, and Alma is not equipped to help with psychological problems.  I think having her write letters, as time passes, is a mistake.  It advances the plot to the next step, true, but a better way should have been found.  She should not be communicating at all, because if she can communicate, there is a way into her mind.  It becomes better for her to be with someone trained in psychiatric care, which Alma clearly is not.  As long as she isn't talking to anyone, letting anyone into her thoughts, there is room for her thoughts to be whatever people think they are.  Once she starts writing, she has room to contradict.  In fact, that's what sets off the next crisis with Alma; Alma thought she was revealing herself to someone perfectly safe, and it turned out that she was wrong.  But why would she not suggest that Elisabeth just write down what she had to say?",

Sontag's opposition to artistic interpretation created an essay that eliminates all the psychological schools of film analysis but argues for an appreciation of form without delving for content, or form-as-content. This non-critical approach to criticism prevents plot summary because what happens is not obvious and expository in experimental film. Paglia has only referred to Jungian archetypes as the origin of her thinking on female sexual personae and obliquely made allusions to 1960s foreign art films as sources of inspiration. Visually striking Ingmar Bergman film that situates itself very much in the tradition of cinema that refers to the limitations of the genre.

Elisabet has stopped speaking, and the attending psychiatrist treats the actress by sending her to an isolated seaside cottage under Alma's care. There the nurse, who must do all the talking for both women, becomes a little enamored of the actress. One evening Alma tells Elisabet about some exhilarating sexual experiences she once had and their unpleasant aftermath. Soon after sharing this confidence, the nurse reads a letter Elisabet has written and is shocked to learn that the actress thinks of her as an amusing study. The relationship between the women becomes tense, and they wound each other. Then Alma has a long dream in which her identity merges with that of Elisabet, but when the nurse awakes, both women have apparently come to at least temporary terms with their psychological problems. ~ Rovi",

Ingmar Bergman's genuine masterpiece Persona is a perfect example of that fact. Persona means \"The aspect of someone's character that is presented to or perceived by others\".\n\nThis 1966 Swedish film starring two of the most beautiful women and wonderful actresses I have encountered on screen: Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann has an utterly simple tale to tell but with an extremely complex yet ferociously dazzling surreal touch from Bergman. Persona was written by Bergman in nine weeks while recovering from pneumonia. It is a story of a nurse, Alma played by Bibi Andersson, who is put on charge to take care of an actress, Elisabeth Vogler played by Liv Ullmann. Elisabeth has gone mute. The Doctor (one of the only 5 actors that appear in this film and played by Margaretha Krook) couldn't figure out anything wrong with her. She is mentally and physically normal yet she refuses to talk. Eventually, both Alma and Elisabeth move to a beach-side cottage for Elisabeth to \"recover\". Alma while spending time with the mute Elisabeth begins talking to her heart's content and confesses her secrets to Elisabeth. Alma slowly understands during her stay with Elisabeth that her own personality is being submerged into Elisabeth's persona....\n\nPersona is one of those beautiful films that we love to visit and revisit just to know it's mysteries. Today I revisited this film. It's beautiful images, though confusing at times, are unforgettable! Especially the ones involving the conversation between it's two fantastic female characters. Many people have said that if we simply mute the sound, it will still remain an admirable piece of art. The prelude itself is a proof of that fact that displays random images of violence and innocence; one that also includes an infamous shot of an erect penis. The most important being those of a movie projector, something that will only be understood once you have seen this film yourself. Persona's imagery is hard to analyze. Over the years, people have developed multiple interpretations. I hardly ever participate in these kind discussions especially the ones that involve surreal elements. Still, the most stunning images that Bergman created in Persona are so exquisite. Bergman is truly an ingenious director. Persona is like travelling in and experiencing a person's worst nightmares, his/hers worst fears and in Persona's case: The fear of dying. The vital thing about Persona is how the audience reacts to it. And no one can ever forget the Stunning cinematography by Sven Nykvist that have created many iconic moments which are often reflected in the world cinema today.\n\nPersona has one of the incredible performances in cinema. Bibi Andersson personifies very well the character of Alma. Liv Ullmann is another brilliant actress who, even without any words, gives a solid performance. Cinematographer Sven Nykvist has photographed both these actresses flawlessly (As described earlier) by using amusing lighting effects. No wonder Bergman fell in love with the pretty Liv Ullmann during the making of this film. Persona has also heavily influenced the cinema world. David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, Woody Allen's films (Love and Death), the two female protagonists in Lars Von Triers' Melancholia are a few examples.\n\nNow, I want to make it clear that this film is not for everyone. Though I will still suggest strongly to give this one a try. This surreal masterpiece is one those films you ought to see before you die...",

The complex and enigmatic themes and ideas of psychosexuality simmering just below the surface are admirably portrayed, but the avant-garde style seems half-hearted, only occasionally making an appearance. Easily the best sequences in the movie were psychedelic little surrealist interludes, such as the one the movie begins with. Beyond that, the movie failed to interest me the second time around, despite the gorgeous cinematography and brilliant direction. This is one of Bergman's most dour pictures, saturated in hopelessness and contained frustration, making it a thoroughly unpleasant experience. This is in no way a bad film, but this is far from Bergman's best and far from one of the greatest movies ever.",

Before watching this someone told me that he liked it better the second time around, if I like it anymore the second time around then Ill have a new favorite film. The film began with a series of multiple ultra violent clips. Ranging from the slaughtering of a lamb to a tarantula. This strange opening got you ready for what's to come in this film. The basic plot is a young nurse who's taking care of an actress, who has chose not to speak for unknown reasons. They go to a summer house in the middle of nowhere together, that's where it all begins.\n\nThis film is a piece of art. It is Dante's Inferno of cinema. Its a gallery of Jan van Eyck in motion. This is one of the few movies that defines what film is. Especially when we go into the art house portion of cinema. Ingmar Bergman made it very clear that this is art. That this isn't real. He did this by reminding everyone it's a movie. Similar things have been done in the future, like in Grindhouse for example but no one did it like Bergman did. There was a shot in this movie of Bergman and his crew filming a scene. There was a moment when there was an effect of the shooting reel burning. To add on to the artistic effect, Bergman only used what he absolutely needed. Only five characters, and only props that were used by the characters were shown in the film. This wasn't just a movie, it was art at its finest point.\n\nPotential spoilers ahead. As this film carried on it became clear that the nurse was gonna have the personality of the actress. Now what I loved is this wasn't really what happened. It was a physiological merge. At one moment the nurse is saying the actresses life story, the next she is yelling \"No I am not you!\". They never became one. This is what made it so Ming boggling. As mind boggling as Donnie Darko, Eraserhead, 2001: A Space Odyssey, it ranks amongst these great films. And I would rank it amongst my five favorites. It truly is a piece of art.\n5 stars",

Persona's characters encounter the existence/relevance of God, fear of death, motherhood, the impossibility of human connection, and the struggles artists must undergo in order to maintain a sense of selfhood despite their profession's pressures.  And in most film and literature, it's usually men who undertake these questions, but 90% of Persona depicts two women coming to terms with such grand, philosophical issues, which is ground-breaking even though it shouldn't be.  Most of the film is profound without being avant garde for avant garde's sake with several notable exceptions like the very beginning and parts of the denouement, and thus, most of the film is accessible and thought-provoking.  I can't say that there is anything revolutionary or that the film comes to a unique conclusion about the grand questions it encounters, but the very fact that Bergman explores the nature of being raises film to a stature enjoyed by few other art forms.\nOverall, Bergman is one of serious intellectual film's masters, more accessible than Godard and more interesting than Fellini, and Persona is one of his masterpieces.",

            "content": "One of the most profoundly erotic films, if not the most erotic, in the history of cinema. That is because it understands that eroticism is a much broader concept than any representation of sex or even touch can provide; it is about dominance and submission, exposition of the soul, fear of and attraction to otherness. Eroticism is thus linked with existential issues and the problems of human relations as much exposure of one's weakness to the other (or should I say the Other?) can lead to ressentment; on the other hand, the strong or dominant sustains his power by feeding on this exposure like a vampire. However, the power relations can change any moment exactly because the concept of power relies on something that submits to it. The film pushes ambiguity and experimentalism to the limit, with a zenith being the celebrated fusion of the faces of the two actresses. I cannot imagine a film that goes beyond this limit and sustains coherence. Still, all the experimental aspects are so well contained in this film almost as if it was a classical piece. The performances are suberb. The scene in which Bibi Andersson tells about the orgy to Liv Ullman is one of the highlights in the acting. The cinematography is a great achievement in its precise, almost minimalistic, way of conveying its object (mise-en-scene helps here too - look at the bare white walls of the hospital for example). It goes further, by using cinematograohic 'dissonances' such as out of focus in order to create new meanings. The whole film conveys, more than any other maybe, the feeling of raw nakedness, the laying bare of the human soul and the bitterness that follows; it is like a reinstatement of Schoppenhauer's hedgehog's dillema. Bergman achieved his peak with this film (though he came close to it again later with Cries and Whispers) which is also one of the peaks of world cinema.",

Like the scene where Alma the actress *spoiler* speaks but then denies doing so the next day when asked*** The two leads are in contrast with each other, the nurse who talks and the mute actress. From what I kind've understood is that the Nurse is the external persona and the mute actress who won't talk is the inner, introspective one.

This film is well scripted, and is, at the heart, a film about co-dependence.

This is known for being one of the best photographed films, which uses the director's favorite cinematographer Sven Nyqvist who does a superb job. With natural lighting and many gorgeous takes on close-ups, Nyqvist does everything possible to make every scene seem as dark as possible. But back to the director--with Bergman, I always expect his movies to make me think, they all do. But this isn't a movie. It's a film. It's a dramatic statement, but when you see \"Persona\" for yourself, you'll understand what I mean. Usually his movies have a premise worth arguing about, like religion, but there is no message to tell with this film. Instead, it's just a surreal psychological dramatic mystery that leaves many things unexplained and keeps you wondering way after the film has finished (no, it's not some lesbian romance movie like the DVD picture portrays). Bergman does something unique, and at the beginning, he shows (what they call a \"prelude\") a set of unrelated images that are very very strange. Some of them are solved in the film, but some of them are not. Half of this is the mystery, and the other half is the strange way how Elizabet (Ullmann) and Alma (Andersson) connect psychologically. I was wondering, \"could this really happen\"? The characters are portrayed to perfection by two of (some of) Sweden's best actresses, Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson. Ullmann's performance is so effective even without speaking, while Andersson impresses so considering the fact she speaks almost every line. They both are perfect, but somehow they even leave something out of their performances, that makes the mystery grow even larger. \"Persona\" is one of the most unique, thought provoking films I've even seen, if not the most. This is Bergman's best work. Highly recommended.",

The cast of five also includes a doctor who suggests Vogler clear her mind in his seaside cottage with Alma her companionable watchdog.\n\nBad idea, worse trip. Dwelling Lynchian layers of paced poetry and images intermittent of Vogler and Alma's awareness of each other's sexual appetites, Bergman cooks half-baked and winds tension by gushing the girls' hopes and secrets, following faith and temptation into the darkness of lavish worship. It's Bergman's expert rendition of the cooperation in repulsion -- and acting revelations of Andersson and Ullmann -- that makes \"Persona\" more than a face in the crowd.

And often the surrealist moments in the film tend to be what I would consider odd choices.  While the first moments of the film I found this off-putting, the overall effect and mood of these elements is quite lyrical.  The film ultimately develops into the story of two women who in their loneliness and isolation become far more dependent on each other than they should.  As the two women in question Liv Ullman and Bibi Andersson drive the film forward in a big way.  Both seem to understand that with so few elements in the film, the responsibility of bringing the material to life is on them, and it really is a remarkable pairing for a film.  The dialogue is sharp and potent when it is present, but much of the brilliance of the film is all emotive and emotion.  Liv Ullman in particular gives a pained, almost Chaplin-esque performance as the largely quiet woman of the pair.  This isn't my favorite Bergman film (I'd still probably put The Virgin Spring at the top of my list), but this is certainly one of his most ambitious ventures, and how much it is able to work with so little going on is a testament to how much of an auteur Bergman really was.",

            "content": "Persona is only the second film I have seen by Ingmar Bergman and I can see how he has made a monstrous, lasting impression burned into the film world. Rarely do we see such images captured in the moment like he so often does in his films. They are so rich and dark but also as white as white can be. To mix these colors together and in front of such vast backgrounds is almost supernatural. He can bend and manipulate light and to meet the most critical scenes of human emotion plastered across the screen in the form of facial expressions. This is one of his most personal films and it begs to be researched as to why. This secluded and complex study may be too much for me to fully comprehend at this point in my life yet I can't deny what I witnessed and I know that with additional viewings, more will be revealed. \r\n\r\nLiv Ullman and Bibi Andersson are the centerpieces of the art décor here. Ullman is an actress who has suffered some kind of even that has shaken here to a condition of complete silence. Andersson is a kindhearted nurse assigned to care for her and post feedback on her condition back to the hospital. The pair take a trip to a seaside cabin to have some time and space to feel out the condition with some beauty as a backdrop. Soon into the trip, Andersson begins to confess past sexual experiences and tightly held secrets about her life to the mute Ullman. The two become close but upon reading Ullman's private letter on the way to mail it, Andersson discovers that she is being studied as much as anyone. Suspicion and fears consume Andersson as she can't take the silence anymore. She rages in her wounds for verbal companionship and the relationship unravels rapidly. As with Hour of the Wolf, my only reference to Bergman's work, it seems that vital portions of the story are either inferred upon or not show in efforts to underline them as having already happened and being presumably understood. This does not always work well for me and after seeing the film, I had to read about it to try and understand what I just saw a little better.\r\n\r\nThis is as intense as a character study can possibly get. Andersson must have awakened true emotions from her past to give this tormented performance. She was terrifying at times and yet later she could be so fragile. What a delicate soul to watch glide through the psychological prison. It is perhaps too deep and complicated for me to absorb in one viewing. It is so intellectual and so self-assured that it might have blown right over my head at times. I admit this only to describe the value of Persona's context. See for yourself what exactly your capacity in one viewing can take. It is a mind-bending and all-consuming picture that dares us to dig deep into the shadows of our mind and though the story is not as forthcoming and explanatory, I find it to be a most rewarding nightmare. This reaction is largely due to the perfect performances by both Andersson and Ullman as well as the gripping direction by Bergman, who generously gives Persona blissful images and thought provoking meanings.

            "content": "PERSONA ranks as one of Ingmar Bergman's masterpieces. Released in 1966 after a three-year hiatus following his \"chamber films\" of the early 1960s, PERSONA is Bergman's first mature film focusing entirely on human psychology and interpersonal relationships, leaving behind the religious angst of his earlier output. \n\nEven before the action of the film begins, we are treated to an incredible mix of images. We see an arc lamp come to life and film rolling through a projector. A silent comedy film pops up for a few moments, only to be replaced by enigmatic footage of a slaughtered lamb and a hand being nailed to a cross. Finally, a boy wakes up (incidentally the same actor as the child protagonist of Bergman's earlier film TYSNADEN), puts his glasses on, and picks up a book (incidentally the same book as in that earlier film). But he is suddenly distracted, and holds his hand out to the camera. We see the boy touch some invisible screen, as the eerie images of two women alternate upon it. Then, the credits roll. This opening montage may seem unnecessary, but it serves as Bergman's way of hammering home the point that what we are watching is a film, and far from being banal entertainment, cinema is in fact capable of expressing striking truths, as we are about to experience.\n\nThe plot of PERSONA initially seems simple. The nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson) is tasked with caring for Elizabet Vogler (Liv Ullmann), an actress who has mysteriously ceased speaking. As Alma jabbers away, while Mrs Vogler says nothing, the action develops much like in Strindberg's play \"Der Starkare\". But a series of events suggests that things are much more complex than they seem. Are Alma and Volger the same woman, representing just two different facets of a single personality? This interpretation is a popular one and quite probable, but the film's mysteries don't end there. What is the meaning of the two historical tragedies Vogler witnesses, the clearing of the Warsaw ghetto and the self-immolation of the Vietnamese monk? Unlike contemporaries like Vilgot Sjoman, Bergman never directly responded to the violence of the mid-century, and I daresay here we get an explanation why, for how can mere words adequately relate to such horror?\n\nIf you don't like auteur cinema, and films that are fairly open in interpretation, then I don't know if I can convince you to love PERSONA in a humble Amazon review. Nonetheless, this is a film I highly recommend for the questions it raises. Rarely does one encounter a work of art that provides such satisfying challenge and leaves one thinking about it for a long time after it ends.\n\nSven Nykvist's cinematography expertly serves Bergman's storytelling. I was especially stunned by a long rolling shot as Alma and Mrs Vogler run along a beach. One gets the sense that after the intentionally limited \"chamber trilogy\", Nykvist was reveling in the greater variety of shots available to him. I'm impressed by how Bergman presents a plot that feels so epic when in locations and casting, at least, this is more similar to the chamber trilogy than the films of the late '50s. Besides Alma and Mrs Vogler, there are only two other characters, a psychaitrist (Margaretha Krook) and Mrs Vogler's husband (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who appear only briefly.",

El plantejament és similar a \"Mulholland Dr.\", però infinitament més extrem i arriscat.\r\n\r\nUna de les principals diferències és que passa en un o dos espais, i amb dues actrius (Bibi Andersson i Liv Ullmann). Una d'elles, Elisabet, és una actriu que durant una funció teatral va deixar de parlar, i no ha dit res des d'aquell dia. No sembla ser cap problema mèdic, sinó psicològic. A l'hospital, la metgessa superior decideix que Elisabet passi uns dies amb Alma (una enfermera) en una casa vora la platja, per fer una mena de \"cura\".\r\n\r\nAquesta decisió és un pretext per explicar una història sobre la personalitat, què és el que ens fa ser qui som. Bergman no presenta un argument clar, es disfressa sota l'aparença d'un trencaclosques, però, com Lynch, el que el director suec pretén és provocar sentiments, reflexió i descol·locar. No es tracta d'intentar comprendre què passa i per què, sinó de fer un exercici d'abstracció i intentar anar més enllà en cada escena, observar les imatges i deixar que ens provoquin. Aquesta és la teoria, el que jo crec que Bergman intenta amb \"Persona\". Pel meu gust cinematogràfic em costa fer aquest exercici d'abstracció, perquè entenc el cinema com la presentació audiovisual d'una història, amb els seus tres actes i la seva narrativa.\r\n\r\nÉs una pel·lícula per veure i reveure, ja que el primer cop que es veu la reacció inicial és aquesta: què ha passat? per què? què vol dir això? I com he dit abans, el principal és deixar-se portar i intentar connectar amb les imatges sense plantejar-se res.\r\n\r\nCom amb tots els mestres, tothom ha interpretat i regirat totes les seves pel·lícules, i potser algú té una explicació lògica i racional de tot el que passa. Jo no hi crec massa, prefereixo disfrutar-la a un nivell més primari, com les de Lynch. 7/10",

Honestly, though, the dialogue mostly bored me. Persona often seems like a long rambling monologue that is only occasionally interesting, and the editing techniques are often silly and outdated. Despite obvious flashes of brilliance, I found Persona to be more of a 1960's arthouse relic than an involving film.

Probably this is the best direction and camera-light work I have seen in a movie so far . This black and white classic is one of the most original and genuine psychological masterpiece of all time, thats for sure !\n\nNow i come back to the point of this movie.The most amazing thing of this movie is that you can explain and see from two very different point of view ! both the lead characters are so complicated and strong that you can't say what's the lead and whats the supporting character ! From the very first appearance of this movie you will see some bizarre and symbolic scenes , traditional from Bergman. After that, the first appearance of the actress will give you many questions of what you will get the answers at the last of movie, in the meanwhile the suspense arise gradually that what happened to her for this kinda unlikely condition ?? why did she made herself mute and detached from the outsider world ??she certainly has her own very reason and U can do nothing but only respect her from that. But would it be pleasant or praiseworthy for every other person ?? There comes the second point of view from the second character !\n\nShe doesn't know many things outside her life, she is only a nurse. But does that mean she can't have her own very feelings about all things, own point of of view, above all her own ''persona \"? She feels like 'The actress' is her idle, though she doesn't wanna talk but that can't her aloft from expressing her very personal feelings only to her what she can't tell everyone. Ultimately she became very close to her, but she only saw the surface of the mentality and everything that that belonged to her, but then came thee twist ! When she finally got to know what she really is, she can't idolize her any more ! All the time she wanted to imitate her, but when she finally got some success in this matter, she can't like her anymore! What will happen now?? What about her own \"Persona\" ? what she will do now ?\n\nIngmar Bergman is a real genius. He pulled every strings so carefully and subtly that you will be stunned and mesmerized how he could do it !I wish I could give it more than 10 ! Feel like seeing it again and again!",

My assumption is it was quite ground-breaking at the time, just because of its topic, storyline, film techniques, and good acting. From what I got of this film, it is about a two woman, one whom is a nurse and the other a mental patient and well-known fictional actress. The nurse is ordered to take care of the actress, only to find that she is falling in love with her, despite the fact she spokes not a word of dialogue. Ingmar Bergman's films are very bizarre, especially if you have seen \"The Seventh Seal.\" In my opinion, \"Persona\" is better, because it is more straightforward and contains some good acting. The topic of apparent lesbianism is definately potent for the 1960's. Definately unusual, but very memorable.",

They are stunning, almost every single word or facial expression they give carries the weight of a thousand emotions all mixed together.

I don't think I've ever seen another movie where the lighting was so fraught with meaning. The story, such as it is, is about an actress who refuses to speak and the nurse who is assigned to take care of her. You could write a really interesting essay about the way the movie uses light to show or hide parts of their faces in different shots. Bibi Andersson has pretty much all the talking as the nurse, and delivers some very long and intense monologues. Liv Ullmann doesn't talk as the actress, but she does look and react (or not). I'll give $5 to anyone who can satisfactorily explain the opening sequence and the presence of the little boy at the beginning of the movie.

            "content": "Could it be that the boy we see in the prelude of Ingmar Bergman's \"Persona,\" caressing the blurry, changing images is a sort of a model of the son of Elisabet (Liv Ullmann) and Alma's (Bibi Andersson) aborted child? I had to view this film again four times to really offer a few of my thoughts. The story concerns a nurse (Alma) taking care of an actress (Elisabet) who has become mute. I was a little worried about having a similar revelation as I had with \"The Seventh Seal,\" but I seem to love \"Persona\" even more with repeated viewings, consequently understanding it better. Why has Elisabet become mute? Of course we know that it's likely because of the terrors of the world: the burning of the monk she sees on television and a picture of the Warsaw ghetto are hints. But, I will point to a not so famous monologue (there are several great ones) in the film; it's where the doctor talks to Elisabet about \"The impossible dream. Not of seeming, but of being.\" I can be wrong, but I believe Elisabet is trying to purify herself by becoming silent: to not say any lies, to not commit any fallacies. This particular sequence I remotely understood only in my last viewing; before that I had no clue what the female doctor was talking about. We all know the astonishing parallel sequence in the near end where Alma speaks of Elisabet's child, however I noticed other shots that can be considered similar, including one that recalls what the female doctor told Elisabet; it happens right after the boiling water part, where Alma again questions Elisabet's silence, she says: \"Is it really important not to lie?\" Some other minor alike shots I noticed where of Bergman's camera cutting to the hands of Alma and Elisabet when both are with the doctor at separate times. Also, in the prelude we see a dead woman (possibly in a hospital), and almost for a second we see her eyes opens; this exact shot is replicated with Alma later in the film when she is in pain and suddenly opens her eyes. Talking about the story would be spoiling it, but I must say there is not much evidence of Elizabeth being part of the transformation; it just seems Alma is becoming Elisabet, and most of what happens after Elisabet looks at the Warsaw photo happens in Alma's mind, possibly a dream. Certainty is impossibility. Even though Bergman disliked Jean-Luc Godard's cinema, I will say that \"Persona,\" while being an entirely original work does have attributes of a Godard; it's told in fragments, even some of the dialogues we can only guess what it is about, along with Bergman composing several different images to create an affect and intercutting images that disrupt the flow of a scene. It's also an extraordinarily minimalist work: I've learned that the actors did not wear make-up, it uses only a handful of actors, the two leading ladies dominate the scope, and only Bibi Andersson speaks for the majority of the film. I don't know if Godard or Kiarostami were influenced by Bergman, but there are specific shots that reminded me of Kiarostami, an example: Alma speaking to the doctor where we can see Alma's face and only hear the doctor. I now understand the influence it had on \"Fight Club,\" excluding the image of the erect penis.  Ingmar Bergman's \"Persona\" is a film which you say it belongs to a category of the highest form of art. It's a landmark in its narrative structure and technical achievements; look at how Bergman zooms in to the photo of the Warsaw ghetto, Bergman is able to take the viewer \"inside\" the picture and make us feel what the people are feeling or how when Alma secretly reads Elizabeth's letter, we cannot hear Liv Ullmann's voice, embodying her silence! Saying as much as you can is saying so little; there are several other masterful sequences that only you can see to believe. I can't say I pay attention to the use of music in every film, but having seen \"Persona\" on a repetitive basis tells me that this is one of very best to orchestrate music into a specific image or scene. An absolute, yet unattainable masterpiece!",

Bergman fills his film (and most notably the oblique opening credit sequence) with visual and aural symbols that have no meaning other than that with which the viewer imbues them.

In some ways, the uncanny \"fear\" and \"eeriness\" that I have felt while watching this Bergman film is comparable with my viewing experience of the short film \"Meshes of the Afternoon\". Both very far from the look of a traditional horror film, but still carves deep into the subconscious, and along with it a weird drama between two(?) unguided women and the bizarre channeling of their psyches. The opening sequence, which is composed of random grotesque images, may or may not mean anything, but so was the whole film; But its stark, uncommon beauty transcends comprehension and even the most complex of explanations. The common conception for a film is creating images to complement a pre-conceived story. But what if it's the other way around? It would certainly look like this.",

            "content": "Bergman never ceases to amaze me. His films from the 1950s and 60s are strikingly similar in many ways: existential themes, beautiful black and white cinematography, running times of general and hour and half or less-two hours tops--religious critiques, explorations of identity and trauma, etc. But what makes Bergman such a remarkable dicrector is that, despite the similarities between these films, they all remain coherent, standalone masterpieces in their own way. Persona fits precisely in this category. A touching, harrowing, and beautiful piece of cinema that could never have been created by anyone other than Bergman. In general, Bergman's films do not revel in overly obscure, \"artsy\" filmmaking, and instead they present themselves in a simple yet beautifully filmed and meticulously directed fashion. Persona breaks with this tradition somewhat by opening with a montage of rather disconnected images that, in hindsight later in the film, set of the theme of identity that lies at the core of the film. Ultimately, Persona is a film about questioing one's sense of identity--am I truly myself or am the persona that project to others. Is my identity, as other people know it, nothing but a lie? Elizabet (Liv Ullmann, painfully beautiful in a ordinary, real kind of way as she always is in Bergman films), an actress, realizes her identity may be nothing more than lie and hence quits talking, quits interacting with others and perpetuating the lie. Alma, (Bibi Andersson, also radiant a plain and real fashion) is nurse assigned to take care of Elizabet as she moves to a seaside house to recover from her problem. Alma fills the silent void left by Elizabet's muteness by talking constantly about herself, her life, her experiences, etc. Ultimately, the two women's identities begin to emerge as polar opposites that may in fact be two sides of one personality--the id an superego without an ego to mediate between the two and bring them in concordance. Beautiful, haunting, and ambiguously mysterious, Persona is Bergman at his absolute finest. He creates truly heartbreaking cinema that will make you question the nature of yourselves and your beliefs, and he demonstrates the true power that art can convey to its audience.",

            "content": "Persona is the Swedish masterpiece by Ingmar Bergman. The film follows two women, a nurse and patient, their relationship and interactions outside of the hospital. The nurse's name is Alma (Bibi Andersson), a young and naive girl with a troubled background. The patient is Elisabet (Liv Ullmann), an actress who has lost her will to live and refuses to speak to anyone. Alma takes Elisabet to a beach house because she believes it will be good for her. Since Elisabet refuses to speak the days go on with Alma talking endlessly and eventually delving into the deepest and darkest aspects of her personal life. There seems to be a role reversal as Alma begins to break down and it is revealed her life may be the more unstable of the two women. Alma's outbursts alienate herself, but a visit from Elisabet's husband reveals her own personal problems leading to a climatic and mind-bending psychological standoff between the two women. \r\n\r\nPersona is a horrifying and shocking film because of the strength of its two leads. They dominate the screen and command attention despite the minimalist dialogue. Elisabet's lack of speech actually enlarges her presence and reinforces the dark and ominous mood that keeps the film so engaging. Persona becomes a psychological analysis for not only the viewer, but for the two characters in the film. Their judgments of each other become our judgments and forward the plot of the film as we observe their behavior in response to judgment. It proves to be emotionally grueling and scary because Alma and Elisbet's proceeding actions are unknown and unpredictable. But that is realistic, it is true human nature and the urge to know what is to come keeps us from looking away from Persona. \r\n\r\nPresented in stark and raw black and white imagery enhances the horror of Persona. It's simplistic yet complicated. Nothing is hidden from the viewer purposefully; it's all knowledge that has to be acquiring with viewing the film. Bergman entices us with lack knowledge to keep us going and watching. The imagery and cinematography keeps everything in perspective. Intense focus is made on particular characters even if they are not speaking. In other scenes Alma and Elisabet are shown squeezed together in one shot. Bergman clearly wants us to focus on facial reactions and expressions between each character. We need to get to know these characters before we are able to understand and judge them the way they do to each other.\r\n\r\nIn my mind Persona is a testament to how psychoanalysis is binal. The nurse quickly falls victim to the judgments of the patient, instead of the other way around. In all elements and situations of life we analyze one another. We look at flaws of our fellow beings and cast judgment upon them. Maybe Persona is a commentary to this negative aspect in the practice of psychology - that our judgments are subjective and we cannot condemn behavior or declare abnormality until we look upon or own flaws. \r\n\r\nOr maybe Persona is a look into a single person subconscious mind and behavior. Possibly Alma and Elisabet are the same person, in denial of past sins and now looking at herself from another point of view. Curious as to how she could be and pondering what her life would be like if it were the opposite; would she still have problems or would life be easier? Alma and Elisabet are literally opposites; one famous the other not, one wanting a child the other repulsed by her child, one the victim of an oppressive husband the other worshipped by her spouse. Bergman implies their similarities in an interesting technique of fusing photographs of their faces. If Alma and Elisabeth are the same person, and two different personas, the question is which of the two is real? \r\n\r\nVerdict: Persona is a creepy and unpredictable thriller fueled by the tour-de-force performances of Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann. Bergman's direction creates an astonishing atmosphere with innovative and creative techniques. He presents us with focus on unrestrained images and events and asks us to pay close attention for our own benefit of understanding. Bergman's orchestrated air of mystery makes Persona engaging and refuses to let up on the tension. Persona is undoubtedly a true work of modernist art whether you fully understand it or not.",

So first of all, I will cover any insults you have planned for me. Yes, I should grow what little is left of a brain and watch Transformers to keep my pitiful mind entertained. Yes, being 15, I have no capability or right to judge such a \"masterfully filmed classic\". No, I will never reach Bergman's style or art of filming due to leaving my few million brain cells in the world of \"OOH-AHH\" graphics. Yes, due to idiotic morons like myself, the world is a lot worse than how it should be. AGH, I don't have enough time to cover every single one, okay? Alrighty, now for justified reasons on why this film makes the Twilight series not half bad....okay, a bit too harsh on Bergman, but whatever. First of all, the environment is WTF at its worst. It's not the good kind. He pushed cinematic barriers to the very edge, which just was not necessary. I'll give it one thing though: it has not dated. To this day, Persona is one of the most bizarre films in history. So yes, Bergman certainly helped other filmmakers out through \"allowing\" the theaters to show anything at all. However, the film went WAY too far. I enjoy grittiness, but up to a certain extent. How can people possibly call this film a wonderful piece of art? The opening alone is a justified reason to hate the movie. Seriously, watch closely to what appears. Yeah, I'll go get the eye wash for ya. Okay, so apparently, there's deep meaning into the fact that the film shows such cinematic faults as showing the crew or having the film tape burn up by accident. You know what? I'm not impressed. Anyone could have done such a simple thing. Yeah, I know what you're thinking though. One might say that it's because it is such a simple thing that people seem to dismiss it. Despite how easy it is to film, Bergman is the first one to think of it as symbolic art. Well, screw that logic. I don't even care what Bergman considers actual art. To \"remind\" the movie viewers that what they're watching is only a film is just silly. It was rather hard to take such quirky scenes so seriously and deeply. Bergman gets a couple points for stretching the field of the film industry to its full potential. Otherwise though, this film is utterly pretentious. Oh, and you might be wondering why I didn't talk about the story or acting. Neither apply with a film like this, so you may think whatever you want about it. It just won't matter....like my opinion, as it'll still get a higher rating than other films that were much greater, like Showgirls. 1.5/10.",

The story is essentially about the degeneration of friendship between a mute patient and her nurse/caretaker.  The film clearly illustrates the ease in which nonverbal communication can be misinterpreted.  Also, there is an underlying theme of conflict in the clashing of two different worlds.  Alma assumes much about Elisabet's life based on her role as a screen actress, and uses this as a basis for admiration and friendship.  When her image of the perfect person is destroyed, the walls of friendship come crashing down in fits of anger and rage.

I see this as study of a woman who sees herself one way but dreams of herself another way. A inner turmoil of not being happy with who she is, in her experience she tries to help her herself to become someone else.\r\n\r\nThe only other way to look at Persona, is just odd dream put into film. Kinda like a Picasso painting, images and words with inner meaning, what that meaning is, can be different for every person that sees it. Either which way, Persona is kinda a mind teaser that has baffled audiences for decades. It's also inspired many films like it since.\r\n\r\nI enjoy Persona, it's different.

            "content": "I sat down to witness the first film I had ever seen by Ingmar Bergman (now a perpetual favourite) having simply read in my college library that it was one of the most powerful and complex films of all time. It is, in fact, a film within a film. Or, perhaps I should say, a film within a film within a film. Lets just say it's complicated! When a movie opens with a hightmarish dream sequence in which a film reel starts to wind up, a goat is bled out, old cartoon nightmare sequences appear, dozens of setting changes assault the viwers perception, a spider crawls, and an erect penis is vividly illuminated, it's clear that you will be anything but bored. The opening sequence is like witnessing the cogs and mechanics of life start to turn and cognate. The nightmare images come to climax with one of the great cinematic images, that of an lost child actually living in what appears to a morgue inside the psyche of Elisebeth. It is a frightening depiction of a character almost arrsstingly introverted and self-contained and of the universe of the bizaree that you've just booked yourself into.\r\nThe plot opens up, in time, with the real world. Space and symmetry are crucial to Bergman's films, as is voice. Here. the distance between Alma and Elizebeth is paramount, as is Elizebeth's frightening mute status. Elizebeth is a famous actress that has sustained an injury during a performance and can no longer speak. Her being an actoe is crucial as she is unfeeling and anaesthethised, can only feign human sense. Alma, a naive but genuine nurse assigned to her care is infatuauted by her. She takes it upon herself to reveal all to her strange new friend in the abscense of conversational reply. Bergman's brilliance can even fing=d symmetry and beauty in cold, sterilsed hospital ward shots that seem hollow yat cranial and lively. She is simple, but beautiful and genuine. Alma means \"soul\" in Spanish. She is the heart and endearment of the piece, offering Elizebeth time in her cabin to recupperate. Although Elizebeth has no serious mental or physical impairment, she doea not speak for the opening half of the film, showing only feigned expressions as Alma goes deeper and deeper into herself and her curious, unwarrented confessions.She is almost Elizebeth's surrogate voice, perhaps the embodyment of the inner child at the opening. In a terrifyingly graphic monologue, she reveals how she became pregnant during unusually casual group sex at a beach, aborting the child without telling her lover. Elizebeth seems irritatingly withdrawn and obstinate, but affectionate. It is the later discovery by Alma diary entry in which Elizabeth cruely mocks Alma's honsty that proves the turning point for the film and marks it's descent into a calculated madness.\r\nAlma, furious, demands that Elizabeth speak. Finally, she gets her to utter a shreek of pain having thrown boiling water on her. The plot becomes disturbing and much more layered. Elizabeth's husband mistakes Alma for her, we are starting to belive them to be symbiotic and interchangable (maybe even the same person.) Elizabeth's sweetness for Alma unravels, Alma wishes to punish her. She has abandoned a husband and chils due to complete apathy, lack of human feeling. This is a covetous and apathetic character, feeding off of and living vicariously through the feelings of others. Alma proclaims famously: \"I am not Elizabeth Vogler!\" Elizabeth is a liar, concealing herself. In other words-she has been mute her entire life, even when speaking. On more than one occasion the film returns to dream scapes and even back to the hospital, the idea may be that the whole film is fabricated-a preformance. The images of relection, cold and opaic rock, and the waterfront are among the best I've ever seen in film.\r\nIn one of films best ever endings, as Alma leaves the cabin, the camera pans over to reveal a film crew (intented to be the crew shooting the film) shooting the sceen. It appears almost as a mistake, as if the camera panned too far but it's far too cognative and brilliant for that. The idea is that this is a film within a film, transcending the medium graciously to illucidate the message about human empathy versus apathy and the importance of the self and dignity in the face of self-honesty. Sweedens best film?? Perhaps. See it, figure it out, and see where you stand.",

            "content": "For all its bizarreness; avant-garde feel and totally disorientating visual style at points, Persona actually tells rather a straight forward narrative and adopts a relatively simple visual approach. The camera work is sly and unspectacular, relying on the film itself and its various bursts of disturbance to get across more of a 'bang' in the viewers mind and its story, with particular attention to the manner in which a relatively routine love story-come-psychoanalytical tale is told, is shot and unfolded using gentle camera-work and soft female voices to aid the visuals. Such a juxtaposition between visuals and timbre are the hallmarks of someone who knows what they're doing especially given the other visuals elements director Bergman includes.\n\nSo about these other visual elements. The film begins with such a rapid display of images; it is difficult for the human eye to garner exactly what has just flashed up. This is after a slow and deliberate track into a person lying in a hospital, looking dead. The opening and closing montages which share the same powerful punch are two of the most eerie I've seen and rank up there with Elem Klimov's 1985 film Come and See and its closing display of images. But what does it all mean? Thrown in at the end of hands touching steamed up glass and odd looking creepy bugs crawling up same said panes is a projection unit playing rolls of developed film onto a white screen. I think to come up with a stone wall idea on what this means is futility of sorts. It could be Bergman reminding us that a film is still just a film and the following events (and events we've just seen) are obviously not real but the psychology behind the events to come (or just transpired) are real and do exist.\n\nThis forces us to consider a complicated area: Sweden's (the nation that made the film) or indeed the world's attention to psychoanalysis and how much we are aware of such a thing. Although the film is produced several decades after the writings, it was made a mere six years after Hitchcock's Psycho which itself included such issues. Bergman's Persona covers the loneliness and isolation of a character named Alma (Andersson) who is a nurse and her gradual appreciation for hospital patient Elizabeth (Ullmann) after so many deviations and, quite possibly, regrets to do with and into the past of the life.\n\nBut the film is a little more than a psychological study, even if by not very much. From my own viewpoint, no matter how wrong or how basic it may be or respectively sound, Alma suffers from this loneliness so much that to have the individual of Elizabeth around actually reminds her of what it's like to have human contact. Indeed, the contact is not a physical one and is not one as graphic as regressions into the past have us believe they used to be. One scene has Alma describe an orgy on a beach with males she did not know at the time and tells us of a friend who was also there but where is that friend now and what meaning does it have toward the larger scale of things? How did she become so 'unpopular' and secluded?\n\nThere can be no denying that Alma comes across as a confident person and looking at the role she plays within the film, a nurse, you would think she needs attributes of charisma and a strong soul in order to combat any nastiness she might see on the job and to work up a strong communicative relationship with any doctor or patient she may come across. Incidentally, that scenario is played out in this film and makes me think that the film is somewhat purely a study of an individual loosing consciousness of what's around her but using the mute character of Elizabeth as a slow burning reason to tell the story. Either way, it's all very complicated but somewhat intriguing.\n\nPersona is the sort of film that gives you a headache but it's one of those 'nice' headaches you get when trying to work something out. Due to the sheer nature of the film and general inclusion of elements of the avant-garde, there cannot really be a stone wall conclusion to the film. Much like Luis Buñuel's early work, Persona is a mixed bag of interesting ideas and un-readable content ? an exercise in futility from any non-qualified film personnel to read into and get marginally close to a correct reading. The film has its characters write letters; read the letters; question one's sanity; show us cameras and film stock being played; have the fourth wall being broken; give us metaphorical montages that are too quick to absorb and then have the audacity to render whatever reading we may have into it all incorrect. But I guess that's all part of the genius of Bergman.",

            "content": "Bergman never ceases to amaze me.  His films from the 1950s and 60s are strikingly similar in many ways: existential themes, beautiful black and white cinematography, running times of general and hour and half or less-two hours tops--religious critiques, explorations of identity and trauma, etc.  But what makes Bergman such a remarkable dicrector is that, despite the similarities between these films, they all remain coherent, standalone masterpieces in their own way.  Persona fits precisely in this category.  A touching, harrowing, and beautiful piece of cinema that could never have been created by anyone other than Bergman.  In general, Bergman's films do not revel in overly obscure, \"artsy\" filmmaking, and instead they present themselves in a simple yet beautifully filmed and meticulously directed fashion.  Persona breaks with this tradition somewhat by opening with a montage of rather disconnected images that, in hindsight later in the film, set of the theme of identity that lies at the core of the film.  Ultimately, Persona is a film about questioing one's sense of identity--am I truly myself or am the persona that project to others.  Is my identity, as other people know it, nothing but a lie?  Elizabet (Liv Ullmann, painfully beautiful in a ordinary, real kind of way as she always is in Bergman films), an actress, realizes her identity may be nothing more than lie and hence quits talking, quits interacting with others and perpetuating the lie.  Alma, (Bibi Andersson, also radiant a plain and real fashion) is nurse assigned to take care of Elizabet as she moves to a seaside house to recover from her problem.  Alma fills the silent void left by Elizabet's muteness by talking constantly about herself, her life, her experiences, etc.  Ultimately, the two women's identities begin to emerge as polar opposites that may in fact be two sides of one personality--the id an superego without an ego to mediate between the two and bring them in concordance.  Beautiful, haunting, and ambiguously mysterious, Persona is Bergman at his absolute finest.  He creates truly heartbreaking cinema that will make you question the nature of yourselves and your beliefs, and he demonstrates the true power that art can convey to its audience.",

Every single moment has added depth, nothing is just on a surface level.  It really helps to listen to what the people who study Bergman have to say.  Most people wouldn't be able to sit through this film.  Even though it's only 82 minutes, it does a lot within that time in which a lot of experiments occur.  It's interesting when filmmakers decide to make the audience realize that they are watching a film and not real life, and Bergman reminds his audience quite often in Persona.  The technicalities of this film makes it beautiful, and the personal level it reaches for Bergman is what makes it extraordinary.  Our persona is sometimes different than who we actually are.  Which part of yourself will you give in to?  Be afraid of pain or excessively living your life?  Or can we ever be happy and find a perfect middle ground?  I give this one a 5/5.",

            "content": "This is what it feels like to uncover an artist who has a deep impact on your life. I wish it had been earlier, but ideas are timeless, and I am slowly discovering those of Ingmar Bergman. With Persona, he is officially one of my three favorite directors, along with Alejandro Jodorowsky and Paul Thomas Anderson.\n\nThe introduction to this film took all of my preconceptions about what it would be like and stepped on them. I had no idea that Bergman could be as avant-garde as such. Bergman has stated how this was the film he went âthe furthestâ with, and I can understand what he means. This is an incredibly psychologically penetrating movie. It is about two women; one, a famous actress who chooses not to speak, and the other the nurse assigned to care for her.\n\nThere are so many things addressed about the human psyche that are, as always with Bergman, refreshing and original. As nurse Alma interacts with actress Elisabet, it is, at first, about herself. She tells Elisabet of her life and several important events within it. But, because Alma garners no response from Elisabet, she quickly becomes frustrated. I had been talking with a friend recently about how intriguing it is that the social behavior of doing absolutely nothing could have such an effect on others around, and Bergman has Alma fall into this kind of reaction. But when Alma discovers a letter Elisabet has written to her doctor, explaining how he she enjoys listening to and studying Alma, as well as unleashing the personal stories Alma had told her, the movie really sets into motion.\n\nItâs difficult to be cohesive with my thoughts on this movie as a whole, because there is so much to take from it. I was tearing up in multiple instances watching this, only because it is such a beautiful moving picture to behold. Every shot is so careful and emotional. There are images that stick with the viewer long after they have moved on, such as Elisabeta laying in bed, devastated, and looking up, thoughtfully, as the camera focuses on her face for what seems like an eternity. Just as you can hardly bear the pure emotion on the screen, she flips over and buries her head in hand and shadows. Or, a little boy, slowly sliding his hands across a giant picture of a womanâs blurred face. Or a shot that brings the influence of German expressionism, with a spiked gate traveling diagonally down the screen in front of the nursing home. Bergman does so much to the senses without any dialogue at all, so itâs hard to imagine how he is also so poignant and profound with the conversations between his actors.\n\nThere are plenty of wonderful thoughts about human behavior here. Alma questions the motives of one who chooses to be silent and unreceptive, and the fallacy of those who are two different people; the person by his or herself, and the person around other people. This reaches out to me, as I have trouble with consistent behavior, as well, choosing to adapt to certain people and situations, rather than be myself, and only myself, at all times.\n\nThere are interesting shots all throughout Persona. I noticed there is a focus on legs, and I also noticed the way both main characters hide their faces in shadow when crying. And, of course, when the screen quite literally rips in half over Almaâs face and crumples. I loved one transition shot that went from the veins in a human eye to looking at similarly-shaped drapes. Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann are both incredible in this, as they have quite opposite roles, but always spend time onscreen. Andersson is the enigmatic and broken Alma, while Ullmann is the famous actress who hides shame by not speaking, and simply reacting with her face. Probably the most fascinating scene, for me, was near the end, when Alma tells Elisabet the sequence of events that led the actress to her coldness. At first, we hear Alma explain to Elisabet while the camera focuses on Elisabet, looking vulnerable and despairing, turning her head when soft spots are hit during the story. Immediately after the story finishes, we start over and see the exact same scene, but this time, looking at Alma read the letter and reading her emotions as she goes through it. I thought it was a brilliant way to examine both characters.\n\nA lot of left open for interpretation here. Some people believe that Elisabet and Alma are the two parts of the same person. This would explain why Alma knew exactly the situation Elisabet was in quite well, and I would not be opposed to that reasoning. But whether or not they are the same person, the important thing about the two characters are their behavior toward the other.\n\nBergman pulls out all the stops for Persona. It is halfway avant-garde imagery and exploration and halfway intimate and telling conversation between two emotionally flawed persons. There is so much in this film that has gone to influence other directors, and I am now beginning to realize how much I have been missing with Ingmar Bergman. I feel like he does not just give to cinema, but to humans in general. His ideas about humanity are important and relatable, and he has this gift of being able to unmask these secrets we hide as people through both conventional and unconventional means, through both sharp abstraction and warm invitation. The best artists do not strive to be anything; they just are. And Bergmanâs romantic style and ability to be equally scary and comforting in his films without deterring from the theme is glorious.\n\nI feel like this is the way movies about people should be made. I would be hard-pressed to find a director who celebrates and questions humanity with such emotion and skill as Bergman, and Persona is now, unsurprisingly, one of my favorite films.",
