            "content": "A Classic War Movie. The acting is good across the board which is impressive considering there is so many characters to pack in. Lee Marvin is the highlight easily and more than anything this is HIS film. That being said the one problem that nagged me was it's very clear over half the film is developing the characters and forming a bond with all of them and the film does this solidly. However some are more developed than others and a handful have no personality really at all and just blend in. Some also have more quirks than real personalities also but they all are likeable by varying degrees. The cinematography is very well done in this with great sets and very well done special effects, some camera shots are weird but most are well framed and capture the dirty dozens emotions well. The music is solid but not phenomenal. This film is very well edited. The Pacing is very well done also with plenty of humorous moments balanced out with building tension and having a very well done spectacle ending. The only real complaint is this film doe everything very well but not phenomenally. It's got a very original idea and embraces the early New Hollywood ideas of Anti Heroes. Anyone who is a war genre fan or any fan of any actors in this should easily give this a try.",

The movie kept me entertained and this is one of the better WWII action movies I've seen (aside from Where Eagles Dare, the Great Escape, and Saving Private Ryan). They don't make movies like these anymore but I'm happy that they had the ambition to when they did in the 60s and 70s!!",

            "content": "I didn't see this movie when it came out because I was only a year old.  Too young for such things.  Now that I am in my fifties, though, I have time to watch old movies and see if I can be entertained.\n\nI was entertained in this movie.  And, I watched it on the cheap, while lying down on my couch with my dog on a Sunday afternoon and letting Netflix play.  I loved war movies as a kid, and I still watch them today.  This one definitely showed its age.  War movies made in the 2000s do not exhibit the themes or mannerisms of the past, cuz' movie goers wouldn't be pleased.  What do I mean?  \n\nBringing a bunch of prostitutes to an army base, and slap-ping one on the butt was definitely something a writer could get away with in the past.  Kinda sexist, and not something an MP officer would do.  And having a white dude use the N-word in a movie, and then letting a brawl happen in a locked room while law enforcement remains outside and makes jokes, not today.  Drinking hard liquor while in uniform and on duty, not cool.  And some being assigned \"hard labor\" while others as-signed \"imprisonment\" isn't done today.  Hard labor is gone as so much abuse and profiteering occurred with friends of the local sheriffs and wardens (though the privatization of prisons is making lots of money for investors and therapists and commissary providers in modern times).  And killing wives and girl-friends of the Germans lieutenants and generals, kinda a bit much.  We aren't supposed to do that, right?  But hey, we dropped two giant bombs on Japan, for real, killing babies and grandmas in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so this isn't really out of the ordinary for us Americans.  And having the character Mag-got stab a German prostitute or girlfriend on the second floor, being in character but messing up the plan, that was not so cool.  \n\nWell, on the positive side, I was amazed at the stars in this movie, having seen so many of them in so many movies.  I re-member Robert Webber from \"12 Angry Men\", and Clint Walker from \"The Ten Commandments\" and westerns like the series \"Cheyenne.\" Donald Sutherland was easy to recognize from \"The Hunger Games\" and so many movies I don't know where to begin.  The bald head of Telly Savalas I remember from \"Kojak\".  Charles Bronson, Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin I've seen so many times on the big screen.  And, there was the Hall of Fame footballer Jim Brown.  I liked this, seeing old faces from my past, movies, entertainment over the decades.\n\nNow, something to think about.  What could these losers do that a trained group of commandoes couldn't?  Nothing.  But it made for an interesting movie as they argued and fought against the system.  Perhaps the funniest part was when Bronson's character was asked to say what he was thinking about as the psychiatrist uttered a single word, and his responses were just funny.  Hysterical.  I would love to do that, if I were questioned by a shrink, and deliver it deadpan as Bronson did.  \n\nHere's a bit of trivia that I didn't know.  In WWII, FDR used 44 prisoners serving life sentences at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary on suicide missions against the Japanese.  Really.  We really did things like that in the past.  I wonder if they volunteered or if they were voluntold, and if any survived.  \n\nI would recommend this movie to anyone who likes war movies and can watch it for free on a streaming service.",

            "content": "A highly entertaining war romp as ragged misfits train to assassinate German officers.\n\nDirector Robert Aldrich's World War II adventure The Dirty Dozen (1967) is a delightful old war classic. Aldrich often gets criticized for the 90 minute training scenes, but I found all of those sequences funny and endears you to these men on a secret mission to redeem their death row status for desertion and other high crimes. Aldrich takes his time in having laughs with each guy and giving them dramatic moments where they're challenged in the rigorous training segments. The finale mission against the actual German threat is amazing and really tense. Aldrich knew exactly when to simply entertain for a lark to when things needed to be actually suspenseful and serious. The Dirty Dozen definitely holds up.\n\nWriters Nunnally Johnson, E.M. Nathanson, and Lukas Heller provide tons of jokes throughout to keep you enthralled, but the actual story itself is interesting. I was intrigued at the army offering commuted sentences for death row soldiers if they kill high ranking German officers on essentially a suicide squad type mission. Each man has a defined motive, backstory, and unique personality, so I actually wanted most of them to make it back home. There's plenty of action and comedy with drama interspersed in between for harder hitting scenes to build trust in these guys.\n\nLee Marvin is gripping and cool as the tough guy hero Major John Reisman. I like how modern and up front honest his hero leader Reisman felt. He never lies to his group of men, instead he leads by brave example and stern discipline to get these hooligans in line. Marvin has the deepest and most distinct voice alongside his sterling commanding role, he is fierce as The Dirty Dozen's fearless leader. Ernest Borgnine is funny as the amiable General Worden, bellowing out orders. Charles Bronson is captivating in a tense dramatic role as John Wladislaw. His hurt eyes and hypnotizing stare are signature aspects to Bronson. He's as interesting, likable, and moving as Lee Marvin in The Dirty Dozen.\n\nJim Brown is great and brave as Robert Jefferson, especially when he's standing up to racists and Nazis. John Cassavetes has a screw loose as the fiery hothead Franco. He's a lot of fun. Richard Jaeckel is steadfast as Marvin's helper Sergeant Bowren. George Kennedy is nice as the supportive Major Max Armbruster. Trini López sings a nice song as Pedro Jiminez and gets a few laughs. Ralph Meeker is great as the cynical therapist Kinder. Robert Ryan is furious and entertaining as Colonel Breed. Telly Savalas is absolutely raving mad as the religious zealot Archer Maggott. Donald Sutherland is hilarious as the lovable fool Vernon Pinkley. Clint Walker is gigantic and nice as the gentle giant Samson Posey. Stuart Cooper is good as Lever and would go onto direct The Disappearance with Donald Sutherland.\n\nMichael Luciano's editing keeps The Dirty Dozen moving along steadily so that I was never bored despite the two and a half hour long run-time. Every scene is passed to be a bit suspenseful with a sense of humor.\n\nEdward Scaife's cinematography neatly focused on close-ups of each guy when he's feeling something painful or hilarious to really make you remember each character. For a war film, all the ultra wide shots of fields and compounds are fun for the action. But all the close-up shots really make The Dirty Dozen memorable, fun, and often moving when something traumatic happens. Composer Frank De Vol nails the exciting, tense, and playful score for The Dirty Dozen to keep things lively.\n\nOverall, it is a fun movie and a classic war film with a fantastic ensemble full of stars and character actors alike.",

            "content": "There are four or five films that are considered to be \"sacred cows\" by most American WWII film fans.  The Dirty Dozen is one of those cows.  Nevertheless, I've never been one to shy away from committing pop culture sacrilege, and this review is no exception. \nThis is a completely unrealistic story of a group of prisoners who have no respect for military authority, and who have been convicted of heinous crimes, on a special mission that requires a great deal of discipline and teamwork, sent to mass murder a group of unarmed German officers and their civilian wives or girlfriends attending a party by locking them in a bunker, pouring gasoline on them, and setting fire to them.  If that seems oddly familiar, it's probably because it's similar to some of the things that the Germans did to the Jews, which appalled every decent person in the world when it was discovered.\nI find it interesting that the filmmakers did not realize that if this story had taken place in real-life, the American soldiers and their superiors would have been guilty of committing a war crime.  However, judging by the continued popularity of this film, as long as there are lots of explosions, machismo, A-list action stars, and as long as it's the enemy that is being murdered with no means of defending themselves, then it's okay.\nThe good thing about this film is that the story would have never taken place in real life.",

Boy, was I disappointed! This really is a dumb movie and is indeed suitable for teenagers; I apologize for having been one. Who came up with this plot line, anyway? Engaging murderous soldiers on death row, some of them true maniacs, to conduct a top secret machine to kill a big chunk of the German General staff in one fell swoop - the US Army couldn't find anyone better for this critical mission which requires cool wits and at least passable German? So, they select this crazy incarcerated bunch, \"train\" them in a few weeks which included them ingeniously and \"hilariously\" passing a war game test while building camaraderie, and the next thing we now they have been dropped right next to the château where the German generals are partying and there are only two guards manning the entrance driveway. It's that simple. The only flaw - they forgot to train them in speaking German. Oops! However, they thoughtfully did train them in, get ready for this … sliding in order to expeditiously remove their boots.  The whole thing was so ridiculous that I couldn't help myself giggling. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is the ensemble cast still exudes the magnetism after all these years. Also, I be should add, it was wonderful to see Jim Brown running.",

Sometimes things may not make much sense or even appear realistically possible, which is part of the fun in this genre, but anyone who is constantly saying \"that could never happen\" while watching movies, will be driven nuts.\n\nInglorious Basterds, Suicide Squad, Con Air, and the aforementioned Predators are just a few of the \"team\" style quest movies that came to mind while watching this.

This movie is really violent and crude, probably one of the most hardcore movies of the 60's. This was the blueprint for a lotta hardcore action movies, it was even ripped off by Italy in the \"Inglorious Bastards,\" which of course Tarantino ripped the title off of and spelled it \"Basterds...\" I think. So, why did Tarantino knock off a knock off when he coulda just ripped off the original and called it the toe sniffing twelve or some shit like that. I dunno, but Dirty Dozen sure AF is better than Inglorious Bastards or Basterds, either one. This movie and the whole cast just blatantly didn't give a fuck, and this being one of the most oldest 531 movies and one of the most offensive and least fuck giving just puts it way up there in terms of stars, bags, and fun!",

With John Cassavetes as the most volatile of the lot, a pre-\"Kojak\" Telly Savalas as the craziest, and a pre-\"Death Wish\" Charles Bronson.

Great underdog war Flick . \nDuring World War II, a rebellious U.S. Army Major is assigned a dozen convicted murderers to train and lead them into a mass assassination mission of German officers.\nThe Dirty Dozen into one of MGM's biggest moneymakers of the 1960s--and the sixth highest-grossing film in the studio's history. Lee Marvin plays Major Reisman, assigned to coordinate a suicide mission on a French chateau held by top Nazi officers. Since no \"normal\" GI can be expected to volunteer for this mission, Reisman is compelled to draw his personnel from a group of military prisoners serving life sentences. This \"dirty dozen\" includes a sex pervert (Telly Savalas), a psycho (John Cassavetes), a retarded killer (Donald Sutherland), and the equally malevolent Charles Bronson, Trini Lopez, Jim Brown, and Clint Walker. On the dim promise of receiving pardons if they survive, the criminals undergo a brutal training program, then are marched behind enemy lines dressed as Nazi soldiers, the better to overtake the chateau and kill everyone in it--including the innocent wives and mistresses of the German officers. \n\n The cast here is brilliant and each brings something to the screen that makes this such a great film. As an action film, The Dirty Dozen ranks as a classic of the genre.",

The Dirty Dozen includes a few too many people to completely establish all of their unique characteristics, but I got to know enough of them to start caring about their mission. And I adored Lee Marvin as the man bringing them all together. His tough-as-nails personality fit, and he also showed the kind of wisdom that made it clear why he could organize these unruly men. The time spent on all the training and practice was actually my favorite part of the film. Seeing how The Dirty Dozen got over all their individual issues to become a coordinated team is so satisfying. The rivalry with the Airborne division adds something more to that as well. You can see the slow transition of the characters as individuals and also as a unit. There were some moments that pushed my suspension of disbelief considering how carelessly firearms were used, but I was able to just let it go and enjoy the story. The final act when they finally get around to the big mission is a harrowing adventure. They set it up perfectly by laying out exactly what we can expect, which makes it clear for us when things go awry. The twists and turns of the assault were exciting and I had no idea how many of the team members would survive. There were moments when I started to lose track of where each team member was and what they were doing, but it all came together for the final climax. I loved The Dirty Dozen a lot and can’t wait to watch it again soon. ",

            "content": "In Britain, in the spring of 1944, Allied forces are preparing for the D-Day invasion. Among them are Major John Reisman (Lee Marvin), an OSS officer; his commander, Regular Army Major General Sam Worden (Ernest Borgnine); and his former commander Colonel Everett Dasher Breed (Robert Ryan). The three personalities clash easily. Reisman is aided by his friend, the mild-mannered Major Max Armbruster (George Kennedy). Major Reisman is assigned an unusual and top-secret mission, code-named Operation Amnesty. He is to select a small band of the Army's worst convicts and turn them into commandos to be sent on a virtual suicide mission, the airborne infiltration and assault on a château near Rennes in Brittany. The chateau will be hosting a meeting of dozens of high-ranking German officers, the elimination of whom will hamper the German military's ability to respond to D-Day by disrupting the chain of command. Those who survive the mission will be pardoned and returned to active duty at their former ranks. However, as Reisman repeatedly tells the men, few of them will be coming back from this one. Reisman is assigned 12 convicts (the 'Dirty Dozen'), all either serving lengthy sentences or awaiting execution. Notable members include slow-witted Vernon Pinkley (Donald Sutherland); Robert Jefferson (Jim Brown), an African American soldier convicted of killing a man in self defense; Samson Posey (Clint Walker), a gentle giant who becomes enraged when pushed, convicted of accidentally killing a man who purposely shoved him; Joseph Wladislaw (Charles Bronson) a taciturn coal miner recruited for his ability to speak German, a battlefield-commissioned former officer convicted of shooting his platoon's medic; A.J. Maggot (Telly Savalas), a misogynist, religious fanatic, and probably insane soldier convicted of raping and beating a woman to death; and Victor Franko (John Cassavetes), a former member of the Chicago organized-crime syndicate who has extreme problems with authority, convicted of robbing and killing an elderly man for two pounds and ten shillings. Will the group manage to keep together and perform the suicide mission...? \n\nIn response to the violence of the film, Roger Ebert, in his first year as a film reviewer for the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote sarcastically:\n\"I'm glad the Chicago Police Censor Board forgot about that part of the local censorship law where it says films shall not depict the burning of the human body. If you have to censor, stick to censoring sex, I say...but leave in the mutilation, leave in the sadism and by all means leave in the human beings burning to death. It's not obscene as long as they burn to death with their clothes on.\" In another contemporaneous review, Bosley Crowther called it \"an astonishingly wanton war film\" and a \"studied indulgence of sadism that is morbid and disgusting beyond words\"; he also noted: It is not simply that this violent picture of an American military venture is based on a fictional supposition that is silly and irresponsible.... But to have this bunch of felons a totally incorrigible lot, some of them psychopathic, and to try to make us believe that they would be committed by any American general to carry out an exceedingly important raid that a regular commando group could do with equal efficiency - and certainly with greater dependability - is downright preposterous. Crowther called some of the portrayals \"bizarre and bold\": Marvin's taut, pugnacious playing of the major ... is tough and terrifying. John Cassavetes is wormy and noxious as a psychopath condemned to death, and Telly Savalas is swinish and maniacal as a religious fanatic and sex degenerate. Charles Bronson as an alienated murderer, Richard Jaeckel as a hard-boiled military policeman, and Jim Brown as a white-hating Negro stand out in the animalistic group. Variety was more positive, calling it an \"exciting Second World War pre-D-Day drama\" based on a \"good screenplay\" with a \"ring of authenticity to it\"; they drew particular attention to the performances by Marvin, Cassavetes and Bronson. The Time Out Film Guide notes that over the years, \"The Dirty Dozen has taken its place alongside that other commercial classic, The Magnificent Seven: The violence which liberal critics found so offensive has survived intact. Aldrich sets up dispensable characters with no past and no future, as Marvin reprieves a bunch of death row prisoners, forges them into a tough fighting unit, and leads them on a suicide mission into Nazi France. Apart from the values of team spirit, cudgeled by Marvin into his dropout group, Aldrich appears to be against everything: anti-military, anti-Establishment, anti-women, anti-religion, anti-culture, anti-life. Overriding such nihilism is the super-crudity of Aldrich's energy and his humour, sufficiently cynical to suggest that the whole thing is a game anyway, a spectacle that demands an audience.\n \n\"The Dirty Dozen\" is amongst those great big budget ensemble war movies that came out in the 60s and 70s, with the difference that \"The Dirty Dozen\" is quite ugly, violent in an authentic way, anti-everything, cynical, psychopathic and sadistic. What sort of responsibility do we have in war? What does war do to you? Is it morally ok to use convicts as canon fodder in a suicide mission? Are their lives worth less than others? The film by director Robert Aldrich adds plenty of rich moral dilemmas for the brain during the watch. As Time Out Film Guide said: Aldrich appears to be against everything: anti-military, anti-Establishment, anti-women, anti-religion, anti-culture, anti-life. He intended the film as an anti-war allegory for what was happening in Vietnam at the same time and from all the extra stuff behind the scenes it´s quite apparent that he wanted the film to show what war really is up close without sugarcoating it. And with an ensemble of Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Donald Sutherland, Clint Walker, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Webber, John Cassevetes etc you simply can´t go wrong if you manage to pull out great performances from them which Aldrich did. The ones that really stands out are Marvin as the disobediant and anti-hero Major Reisman and Cassevetes as the hardnosed criminal and trouble-maker Franko. We get top notch performances from both. The art direction, special effects, sets etc adds to the production value as well. \"The Dirty Dozen\" is a great anti-war ensemble piece that entertains you on one hand but at the same time makes your brain question the moral and actions you see on the screen.",

Lee Marvin is a WWII major charged with offering a dozen military prisoners who are either sentenced to death or life in prison with a chance at a pardon if they volunteer to go on a suicide mission behind enemy lines in Nazi Germany. The overall story is a pretty familiar and well trod one, whipping a group of raw recruits into shape for a deadly mission. However, the film stands out as unique in a number of ways. One, Lee Marvin in the lead as Maj. Reisman is a major factor in this film being a favorite of mine. Even though Marvin derided the film as  \"crap\" and \"just a dummy moneymaker,\" he gives one of his best tough guy performances. This may be a matter of personal taste that Marvin is one of my favorite actors, but it's certainly a big part in my loving this film. And regarding Marvin's sentiments towards this film, I'll back Marvin's comments insomuch that this film is not  at all a realistic depiction of war (see Marvin in Samuel Fuller's \"The Big Red One\" instead for that). And as an aside, Marvin actually wrote quite eloquently about his wartime service in the Pacific theater of WWII and himself is interred t Arlington National Cemetery. Another major factor is the director Robert Aldrich brings a level of toughness rarely seen in Hollywood pictures to this picture. The violence here stands out even more so compared to say \"Bonnie & Clyde\" or \"The Wild Bunch,\" which were very much breaking with tradition, whereas the script for \"The Dirty Dozen\" is really a pretty old style of story right out of \"Sands of Iwo Jima\" with a tough-as-nails officer whipping a rag tag group of recruits into shape for a deadly mission. It's a pretty durable formal that's been resurected again and again, though Aldrich and screenwriters Nunnally Johnson and Lukas Heller (from a novel by E.M. Nathanson) up the ante on that old story by making the receipts murders, rapists and criminals, by making the tough officer just as antiestablishment as his sociopathic team, and by being willing up the brutality rarely seen in previous war films (i.e. killing civilians). It's also important here to mention the cast, who besides Marvin includes Charles Bronson, Donald Sutherland, Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy, Robert Ryan, John Cassavetes, Telly Savalas, Richard Jaeckel, Clint Walker, and Jim Brown. And director Aldrich fills the film with terrific details, like the (SPOILER ALERT) siren in the tension filled finale that adds level of street with it's content blaring an then finally it get's shot out and stopped, but then the silence and lack of the sirens is even more scary. Aldrich, though has always been smart about his use of sound designed, which is on display in just about every scene in \"Kiss Me Deadly.\" I'm not going to argue that this film is high art, but this is certainly among one of the most entertaining action films of all-time.",

It is highly conservative in its macho 60s-70s stylings and dated attitudes but it is also subversive in its (Vietnam era) metaphor of dumb-schmuck cannon-fodder. It is broadly comic at times and horrifying at others. It is very clever but also very animalistic.\n\nI love it.\n\nIt's got some issues. I DO really appreciate the sedate pacing of the training and war games segments, but perhaps they are a little overweighted compared to the climatic siege. And the action and violence (while derided/celebrated as extremely OTT at the time) is nothing particularly special in this Tarantino age.\n\nBut the film is well-directed and lavishly produced. And what works gangbusters are these: characters, casting, and charisma. The cast is absolutely fantastic, and (while some of the \"dozen\" are just wallpaper) many of these \"actors\" are gifted with great stuff - scenery-chewing (Marvin, Cassavetes, Savallas, Sutherland)- or simply leanin' back and being cool (Marvin, Bronson, Brown) THIS is what has turned the film into a minor classic of the men-on-a-mission sub-genre. Not the kooky (non) politics. Not the exquisite balancing act of hatred for everyone with giggling at everything. Not the disgust of war combined with the lust for violence. Not those. Instead - the cast. Those perfs. Just watching the film made my voice drop an octave and my balls drop a bit lower. I know, right!

            "content": "The Wild Bunch goes to war, you know, before \"The Wild Bunch\" even came out. I understand that Lee Marvin was supposed to be one heck of a Marine in really life, but it's hard to see Lee Marvin and not think of westerns, especially when he's paired up with an ensemble that features Ernest Borgnine. Man, with Marvin, Borgnine, George Kennedy, Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, Donald Sutherland, Ben Carruthers, Milo Vladek, Al Mancini, Colin Maitland, Trini López and Telly Savalas, this isn't a particularly pretty Hollywood cast, and then John Cassavetes, Clint Walker and Stuart Cooper show up, probably so this can actually be called a Hollywood cast. Even the looks of the stars in this film are nitty and gritty, so you know that there is going to be some dirty fighting in this flick, and plenty of it. Hey, there better be, if this film is going to run two-and-a-half hours, which is a lot of time spent towards one mission in one film. That barely worked in \"The Guns of Navarone\", although I might just be mentioning that because as often as this has been ripped off, I can't believe that there is an older film for it to rip off. I'm kidding, because it's not fair to call this a rip-off if it is better than \"The Guns of Navarone\", which was still good, despite issues that aren't completely washed away this time around.\r\n\r\nThe film is fairly well-known for its audacious originality in quite a few areas as a Hollywood war film of the time, but the uniqueness is a little subtle, and yet prominent enough to make it all the more glaring when the film does fall into formula, whose reinforcement of predictability is problematic enough. The ambition to have an edge which is ultimately limited in the long run also makes it a little difficult to embrace the grime of the characters, all of whom are intentionally thoroughly flawed in a manner that is forgivable for only so long, before your investment begins to become a little loosened because of the characters' being, in a way, a touch obnoxious and occasionally limited in dimension. Perhaps there would be more consistency to a sense of humanity in this film if the story itself had more depth, because no matter how entertaining, this \"drama\" is more action-oriented than anything, and you can do only so much to flesh out an \"epic\" of that type. Really, the issues discussed up to this point, as far as being serious enough to hold the film back, pale in comparison to mere natural shortcomings that go stressed by an ambition to flesh out this film, with a series of somewhat episodic segments who shifts feel a smidge jarring, due to each segment being fleshed out for way more than a smidge too long. I've already touched upon how there's not much in the way of conceptual dramatic consequence to this film, yet the final product still comes out clocking in at a whopping two-and-a-half hours, on the dot, and it doesn't get there as organically as it probably should, meandering along with a lot of fat around the edges that doesn't really add as much to this narrative as it wants to. Again, there's little to really complain heavily about, with even the bloating not being as excessive as it could have been, but the film's reward value is still threatened by those subtle hiccups and prominent natural shortcomings, in addition to limitation in the quantity of things to praise. Of course, what there is to praise is all but worth lauding in its crafting a thoroughly entertaining war flick of solid intrigue, even in concept.\r\n\r\nUnder the weight of natural dramatic limitations which are stressed by a hint of conventionalism, overly grimy characterization, unevenness and fat around the narrative edges, the final product ultimately comes to the brink of underwhelmingness, ultimately overcome by an intriguing story's being done enough justice by sharp writing, lively direction, tense action and, most of all, sparkling charisma and chemistry throughout a solid ensemble cast to make Robert Aldrich's \"The Dirty Dozen\" an ultimately rewardingly entertaining war thriller.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

            "content": "With a talented cast lined up, The Dirty Dozen sounded like an exciting war film.\n\nThe Dirty Dozen was a really interesting experience. Coming from the time when the counterculture movement was taking off, The Dirty Dozen predates the landmark film Easy Rider by two years. This time around, the aggressive and powerful authority figure is the one that the film supports as his platoon of convicts rebel against him. Instead to taking their side, The Dirty Dozen follows his and ends up being a tale of recruitment and training, so it really isn't as deep as it could have been and has viewers looking at members of the titular dozen in a more negative light. The viewers have to get to know the characters before they actually sympathise for them, and whilst the film does eventually reach that effect, it is only through the development of the characters. What I'm saying is that The Dirty Dozen is a really one-sided film which favours the fictitious dangerous military training methods over the existence of its soldiers, even if its soldiers are convicts in this situation. What I'm saying is that The Dirty Dozen is not a bad film, but it certainly is not one which takes a fair look at the sides of both the trainer and the trainees. It does touch upon the themes later though because as other authority figures in the military begin to gain wind of the top-secret situation at hand they attempt to corruptly get the information out of the titular Dirty Dozen, and this shows the twelve convicts standing up against authority. So the message in The Dirty Dozen is rather confusing as it supports giving in to certain forms of authority but not giving into others despite both forms of authority belonging to the same military. So what the film is actually saying can prove confusing in certain areas.\nBut despite the muddled message in The Dirty Dozen, it still turns out to be an entertaining film. Although like many war films it is a long and slow feature with this particular film being one split into three main segments, it stays consistently interesting because of the great characters and the way that director Robert Aldrich lets that the story unfolds. The atmosphere of the film feels a bit light for it to be the gritty war film that it wants to be, this proves to have both positive and negative results in the final. Negative in the sense that it means that the effect of the film is not that hard hitting, positive because it means that the story has room for some laughs along the way. All in all it achieves a mixed response in my opinion because it means that the effect of the story is limited and the harsh nature of the mission is not as serious as the characters claim it to be, but it also means that the material does not drag viewers through the same old tired war cliches. So though the tone may not always be the most ideal, The Dirty Dozen keeps its long story entertaining in one way or another.\nHowever, the actual mission itself is not as exciting as one might have hoped. After everything leading up to the climax, the two hour build-up to it does not fully justify the quality of its execution. The main issue is that although the script in the film puts a lot of harsh emphasis on the final raid, the transition into it is not that exciting. While the detailed explanation of how it happens is good and the set up for it is firm, it all changes when one of the characters betrays their comrades mid-mission and murders a woman. This one plot dynamic was one I found to be just tedious because the character was such a thoughtless prick that he compromised everything and it tore apart the theme of camaraderie that the preceding two hours of the film had spent building. Basically, the main problem I had with The Dirty Dozen was the way that the character Arthur J. Maggott single handily changed the path of it during the most important scene of the film, and while the fault is not the actors, the presence of that character really damaged the film in my opinion. After such an extensive build-up of intense expectation, the fact that The Dirty Dozen suddenly changes everything in the blink of an eye is really not that much of a welcome twist. It speeds the film up and throws instant intensity at the viewers in an unepexected before churning out its action climax, so the pacing of the film is far from perfect.\nUltimately the quality of the story receives has some flaws in my opinion, but as a whole the general concept is an exciting one and the screenplay matches it with plenty of strong dialogue to support it all. One of the best things about the writing in The Dirty Dozen is the fact that it makes an attempt to ensure that few of the main characters in the film have irrelevant meaning. Attempting to characterize more than a dozen main characters in a single film is not the easiest challenge and The Dirty Dozen does have to forsake the depth of some characters in favour of others, but it makes a strong effort to connect the audience to its titular team of mercenaries whether it's through appreciating their friendly interactions or finding antagonism in their attitudes. The developing relationship between the titular team and commanding officer evokes themes of camaraderie with occasional sparks of conflict to ensure that things are never falsely picture-perfect.\nWhen it comes to the technical qualities of The Dirty Dozen, the entire film is constructed very well. The scenery for the film always picture perfect, giving an immaculate setting for the narrative which fuels everything with natural imagery. The cinematography also manages to effectively capture the scope of the film and the detail in the physical acting of the characters. The composition for the music in The Dirty Dozen is also a strong fit, emitting the strong feeling of a classical war movie during the more inspiring moments of the film while pulling back for a more slow-burning atmosphere of tension over the duration of the climactic build-up. All these elements bond together brilliantly during the climactic action scene. The musical score keeps things intense while the sound effects keep the loud bangs of warfare very active, keeping their prolonged period of gunfire and explosions dramatic and spectacular. The editing during these scenes is also timely, fast enough to intensify the mood yet slow enough so that things remain visually clear. There are some moments amid the action climax where the actors stop and smile, finding a sadistic pleasure in their plight to kill the Germans. The result is a depiction of horrors from the war in a different meaning, the kind where soldiers become so accustomed to killing that it becomes a joy of theirs. Ernest Borgnine argues that this is the reason The Dirty Dozen was not nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and however true it may be it is an absolute necessity to fit the realism of the narrative.\nAnd last of all, the cast in The Dirty Dozen deliver a brilliant collection of efforts which captures the feeling of humanity within the intentions of the script and brings it to life with all the dramatic and humourous ambitions.\nLee Marvin makes the perfect lead actor for The Dirty Dozen. From the instant he comes on screen, Lee Marvin is very strict with his swift responses and answers anyone who approaches him with the utmost respect and sophistication. This makes him the perfect fit for a soldier in any film, and he just builds from there as he progressively develops into the leader of a criminal platoon. His ability to maintain this edge just increases as the ambition of the story grows bigger, and he passes this spirit onto the actors around him. It's as if he actually has to train the actors in the same way Major John Reisman has to train the criminals he has recruited, giving him a greater edge of responsibility in the leading role. Lee Marvin has the natural charisma of a soldier but pushes it even further for The Dirty Dozen, sharing a rich chemistry with any fellow cast member lucky enough to cross paths with him and proving that he still has his strengths in handling artillery without neglecting the ability to momentarily laugh along the way. That way, he grasps the serious nature of the story with relentless strength but knows when to laugh as well. \nJohn Cassavetes unleashes a wave of antagonism against the authority he clashes with in The Dirty Dozen, holding nothing back and letting all his rage out. It isn't excessive even though it is occasionally funny, and most of the time it feels raw. He has the intense nature of a real soldier to him, but he also represents a key figure for the anti-authoritarian themes of the film which causes a rift between his character Victor Franko and John Reisman. His chemistry with Lee Marvin is rich for both the actors, and as the story progresses we see John Cassavetes develop his character very well. He gains more strength, determination and focus which is made all the more powerful by a contrast to the character he was at the start of the film. John Cassevetes is one of the finest members of The Dirty Dozen.\nClint Walker emits the feeling of a gentle giant in The Dirty Dozen. Samson Posey comes off as being a friendly character, but also a man whose tremendous stature and temper becomes his downfall even though he clearly makes an effort to suppress them. He shares a memorably intense moment with Lee Marvin where the man antagonizes him to really push the limits on the character, and despite his attempts to contain himself he progressively leads towards unleashing it. Clint Walker is able to successfully make a likable character out of Samson while engaging with the physical challenges of the film with the utmost ease.\nDonald Sutherland is very much present for the sake of comic relief since he stands out as one of the more ignorant members of the titular team of mercenaries. He does his duty when the film demands him step up to the battle, but the majority of the time he simply brings the laughs along with his confused facial expressions and keeps the laughter alive.\nCharles Bronson is a welcome presence in any film simply because of his hard-edged nature and his ability to maintain it throughout any scene as well as his skill with weaponry. And Telly Savalas is a relentless creep who always has something to hide, making him a suspicious and engaging screen presence.\nJim Brown is an appealing addition to the cast as Robert Jefferson is a victim of the oppressive racism of the time yet does his duty without sacrificing any dignity in the process, making him respectable and likable from the beginning\nLastly, George Kennedy projects a likable supporting presence due to his instinctive energy whileand Ernest Borgnine makes a capable foil.\n\nSo The Dirty Dozen may have an ambiguous message and a slow pace, but it is a serious war classic due to the originality of its premise, the engaging characters, sense of humour and Robert Aldrich's visionary sense of direction.",

            "content": "Lee Marvin heads the cast as a rebellious Major during World War II who is assigned a suicide mission by his commanding officer, ably played by Ernest Borgnine. He must select 12 soldiers, convicted and sentenced to death or long prison terms, train them and take them on a mission behind enemy lines to destroy a large chateau and kill a large number of important German officers who'll be partying there that night.\r\n\r\nThe film's main selling point is the all star cast, all of whom do really good work. Marvin is tough in the lead and he is well supported by Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy, Robert Ryan, Ralph Meeker and Richard Jaeckel playing the American officers.  The convicts are wonderfully played by among others, John Cassavetes, Jim Brown, Telly Savalas, Charles Bronson, Clint Walker and Donald Sutherland.   John Cassavetes steals the show with his cocky Franko.  Donald Sutherland, although not well known at the time, provides some good comic relief.  The scene where he is asked to impersonate a General inspecting the troops is memorable. Telly Savalas is a little too heavy for the film but adds menace as a religious zealot.  Charles Bronson is good value, as is Jim Brown who plays the strong, silent type. The rest of the cast give good performances, but I'll be honest and say that the famous faces stuck in my mind more.\r\n\r\nThis film can be divided into three. It opens with Lee Marvin observing a soldier being hanged and he is asked to recruit the team.  As the opening credits to the film are rolling he walks along the line of 12 prisoners and stares at each of them as Sergeant Bowren, played by Richard Jaeckel. reads out their sentences. \r\n\r\nThe second part comprises the training for the mission and  It highlights the interpersonal conflicts between the soldiers, some of whom see the mission as a chance for redemption and others as a chance for escape.  The final part is an action sequence detailing the attack on the chateau housing the German officers.  The film's explosive climax is fantastic as you know that inevitably not everyone will survive the mission. The build up and the training scenes are also brilliant as you discover the backgrounds behind these violent criminals.\r\n\r\nOverall this is a fun movie that never drags despite running being a bit long at 150 minutes.. The training section and the mission itself combine to form an enjoyable film that is driven by a great cast playing good characters.  This classic is on par with other \"mission\" films such as The Great Escape, The Devils Brigade  and Where Eagles Dare and is far superior to a number of TV movies made in the 1980s that basically ripped off the premise of this movie.",

Zany march music plays as the anti-heroes gallavant around causing an almost uncomfortable amount of chaos.  The movie is darkly comedic, irreverent, and strangely gruesome.  The characterizations are cliche and the plot is predictable from the outset, but it is fun to see actors like Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas in full madcap mode.",

Much of this can be attributed to excellent pacing and Robert Aldrich's direction, but the cast is also held chiefly responsible; celebrated actors like Lee Marvin, Jim Brown, Charles Bronson, John Cassavetes, George Kennedy and Donald Sutherland all have tremendous chemistry with one another. \"The Dirty Dozen\" is exciting, funny and excellent entertainment, and it's the kind of film that'll hold up to countless repeat viewings.",

            "content": "\"The Dirty Dozen\" is a classic World War 2 movie where Academy Award winner Lee Marvin plays a US Major who is ordered to put together a unit made of imprisoned US soldiers, most whom are on Death Row, and train them for a Top Secret mission to infiltrate a well-guarded château and kill the Nazi officials who are there. \r\n\r\nThe movie was wonderfully directed by Robert Aldrich and Nunnally Johnson. Both used every angle they could find to film the scenes. None of which seemed to be at odd angles. \r\n\r\nThe all-star cast is equally incredible. Not one of them put in a poor performance, or uttered a line poorly. Each put in a great performance worthy of an award in my opinion. The only bad part is many of the cast are in roles I would have liked to have seen more of. \r\n\r\nOne of the best parts of this movie is the visuals. The best of them are undoubtedly the battle that ensues at the château at the end. There were not many quick edits that seemed out of place. The presentation of explosions were also well done, and seemed to me to be the appropriate size -- then again, I'm no munitions expert. \r\n\r\nThe only problem I personally have with this movie is the use of racial slurs. There aren't many of them, I just think they could have done without them in the script. Despite that small problem, the script is well written, and holds up to this day. \r\n\r\nOverall, this is one of the best movies I have seen in some time. I recommend that this is one of your first choices the next time you go to your local video rental store.",

With an all star cast, director Robert Aldrich crafts a thrilling and exciting action picture that delivers some stunning performances, thrills, humor and memorable action that not even today's action flicks can top. The cast here is brilliant and each brings something to the screen that makes this such a great film. As an action film, The Dirty Dozen ranks as a classic of the genre. The pacing of the film is good and lets the action steadily build up to a killer climax. As far as classic action films are concerned, you have got to see The Dirty Dozen. This is a fun, entertaining film that should please either action fans or war film fans, even though this is not a straight forward war film. Richard Aldrich directs a solid piece of cinematic intensity that will certainly appeal to die hard action fans. This is action to its bare bones, with no fancy special effects, and that's why it is a terrific flick to watch. Brilliant and well acted this is a solid entertaining classic that still is fun to watch even today. The actors chosen play their parts well, and each shine on-screen. Lee Marvin is terrific in the lead role as the Major who commands the Dirty Dozen. Little flaws, but you don't care because this is a nonstop testosterone driven action picture that has great performances, and enough thrills to satisfy the most demanding viewer.",

Especially the third act is very suspenseful.\nNow I know what movies like The Expendables try to duplicate - but fail all the time. The Dirty Dozen gives all the characters enough time to develop so that you actually care about them when the thrills come rollin'.\nIt accomplishes that by finding just the right balance between humour and seriousness in the beginning - why and how exactly this worked so well in this film I can't tell, but boy, although it's simple, it's good.",

I did not have a good impression of this movie though. \n\nMy younger brother asked for it. Apparently the show was so good, he could remember even the story details after so many years. Well, worth seeing then.\n\nYup. It is very engaging. Running at the length of 150 min., it doesn't for once feel long. Among the cast whom I know are Donald Sutherland, Charles Bronson and John Cassavetes. John is the father of Nick whose latest movie, The Notebook, is coming to town and he was married to Gena Rowlands.\n\nSome interest findings after watching this and GUNS OF NAVARONE. The way the characters die is very laughable, twisting their bodies and faces. Though alot of scenes of killing, I will hardly see any blood and the killing is much like stageplay. It makes me question the necessity of gory scenes of violence in contemporary movies. \n\nI always have this idea that the story happens at the battlefield when in fact, the first half of the movie takes place at the training base of the dozen and the second half happens at this chateau. The first half is not that as serious and even has some tongue-in-cheek humour. \n\nThe second half is when the action kicks in. The showdown at the chateau is really very very exciting. In the making-of featurette, we are told the set took four months to build and an actor had to risk his life to detonate explosives to blow up the place, just like in the story. That is to say there must not be a second take and the actor if not careful would die at the scene! In the absence of advanced technology in filmmaking, I really take my hat off these forefathers of filmmakers.\n\nThe story of twelve doomed prisoners on a doomed mission with a condemned officer may allow some grounds for some see-we-are-not-that-useless melodrama but surprisingly, the movie downplays all these and instead chooses to tell the story straight as an actioner. Now, got that, Roland Emmerich? \n\nRating: B+",

            "content": "Sadly the Dirty Dozen does not stand the test of time as well as I'd hoped. A classic yes, but it pails in comparison to the war epics that came after it. Having said that, it isn't an all out war movie, and is more a tale of human nature and the  actions and behavior that characterize them. A very solid cast with the break out performance coming from John Cassevettes, in his largest and best known role of his influential career.\nThe movie is a very quick two and a half hours, with the focus staying on the men that comprise the dozen and there personal struggles, rather than indulging in the action sequences. When it is time for action, it's pretty lacklustre and rushed, probably because of the film's final running time. The film's final scene should have been left on the cutting room floor too; finishing on an upbeat note that makes events prior seem far less significant - what we call the 'Hollywood Effect'.",
