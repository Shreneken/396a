Their crimes quickly spiral from petty theft to bank robbery, but tensions between the couple and the other members of their gang--hapless driver C.W. (Michael J. Pollard), Clyde's suave older brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and Buck's flibbertigibbet wife, Blanche (Estelle Parsons) --could destroy them all.",

            "content": "While it's far from perfect, Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde is a seminal film in the development of the American New Wave of movies.  Set during the American Depression, Bonnie (Faye Dunaway) and Clyde (Warren Beatty) roam the countryside in search of easy prey to rob, creating a trail of violence and death.  The film made stars of Beatty and Dunaway, who are both excellent, and served as a springboard for actors like Gene Hackman and Gene Wilder, and features interesting and complex characters, a strong score, great period details, and some impressive cinematography.  If there are criticisms to be made, it would involve the periodically erratic editing which by today's standards feels dated, some bizarre lighting, and the fact that the protagonists consistently (at least until the final scene) make highly improbable escapes.  All in all, it is a solid offering from Penn that should be seen for its historical cinematic importance.",

The film was made to capitalize on the box office appeal of the two leads and served up for-the-time shocking gore to its audience.  Five years later The Godfather would up the ante with the toll booth scene.  The viewer has to put one's self in the shoes of its 1967 audience; at the time millions of older adults would have followed the newspaper and radio accounts of this couple's exploits.  B&C was an updated, Technicolor version of a formula that had made Hollywood tons of cash going back to the days of Jimmy Cagney, George Raft, and Humphrey Bogart, but with more realistic-looking blood.",

It is rare to see the late 1920s era portrayed in such a light and free-spirited manner, as opposed to the \"serious\" climate that usually tents over (especially during and before the time the movie was made). Bonnie & Clyde is indeed a drama and a thriller, but it's also a comedy. I found myself smiling through a large portion of it, and it mainly has to do with the fun nature of the characters. The performances were good, notably Faye Dunaway who was vivacious. The cinematography was good too. The ending gave me mixed feelings however, as it was expected and not creative, and also seemed rushed\u2013albeit in harmony with the pace of the movie.",

Acting was great and the story was compelling, giving the characters a very human touch that seems to be missing from many movies nowadays. The action was also incredibly great for its time, so much so that I think it still holds up fairly well to this day. It also has one of my absolute favourite endings in cinema history, and I think it's one that is extremely memorable and used to this day. My one main concern is that it isn't nearly as accurate as it probably could've been, and I think that making it a bit longer could've improved on some of the issues. Overall, a great film that still holds extremely well today and cements itself as an all-time classic, leaving behind a loud bang that change cinema history forever.",

However, it was wise that the film went beyond just bank robberies to show some actual living, like arguments and pastimes. The plot did feel dragged out though, the way they and the mechanic met was a bizarre choice, some dialogue was poor whilst other scenes relied on weird facial expressions, Bonnie in particular wasn't believable at times, Gene Wilder gave an awful performance and didn't need to be there, and Blanche was extremely annoying. However, the shootouts, getaway driving, and ending sequence made for excellent action, the performances from Warren Beatty and Gene Hackman were well done, the cinematography, editing, and visual effects were solid for the time, the sets/props/costumes looked the part, and the soundtrack was appropriate and slightly catchy.",

I didn't see Bonnie and Clyde until quite recently, and I can completely understand the film's reputation as it is a fantastic film. It is very well made, with crisp cinematography and a superb period recreation. The violence here is not cartoony, it is very violent and shocking, as seen in the ending which I also found quite affecting. Arthur Penn directs beautifully, there is a compelling story, a slick pace and a cracking script with some of the most important and sharpest dialogue in any film of the '60s. I was amazed by the last scene with Bonnie and her mother, it was a scene that is very chilling but also one that resonates emotionally too. And the acting I have no qualms with. Gene Hackman is wonderful as is Estelle Parsons as a somewhat annoying character. Also Gene Wilder makes a brief but funny appearance. But the film belongs to Warren Beatty and Faye Dunnaway, who actually become the characters rather than just playing them. Overall, a fantastic film and one of the best and most important of its decade. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "A cornerstone of the \"New Hollywood\" period, Bonnie and Clyde is exceptional not just for its role in cinematic history, but also as a popcorn-munching Saturday Night adventure. If you want a deep-dive into the real eponymous characters, I recommend LPOTL's podcast three-part series, if you want the 111 minute cavalcade of entertainment, watch this movie. Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) leads the \"Barrow Gang\" through Texas and the Great Plains of the Midwest, robbing everything from banks to corner stores. Bonnie (Faye Dunaway), is his partner in crime and love of his life \u2014 it's fitting that she catches him in flagrante attempting to boost her mother's car. The titular couple has become a reference in their own right, even if they actually weren't all that great of criminals. That being said, Clyde was allegedly a fantastic driver, which were showcased in the film with many a car chase scene \u2014 how these cars going fifty or more miles an hour on nothing thicker than bicycle wheels didn't constantly flip over is beyond me. C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard), Buck Barrow (Dustin Hoffman), and Blanche Barrow (Estelle Parsons, who took away the only acting Oscar from the film) round out the gang. Crime was different in the 1930s, as in significantly easier to pull-off, as is epitomized during the scene where Buck shouts \"We're the Barrow Gang!\" to the frozen bank customers and staff, even raising his mask inches from the guard's nose and stating, \"remember this face\" (para) thereafter. The film was revolutionary in its depiction of sexuality \u2014 the painfully handsome Clyde has impotence issues \u2014 and violence. Early on, there is a grotesque scene where Clyde shoots a banker in the face as the victim jumps on the side of the getaway car. Later, a shoot-\u2018em-up style firefight with the police in Iowa kind of brings you back into the danger this world permits \u2014 I found it comical that the police arrive and just start blasting away. Most notable, however, has to be the final scene. The embarrassed (and legendary) Texas Ranger, Frank Hamer (Denver Pyle), takes a cohort of lawmen and fills our gorgeous couple full of lead long after they've stopped flopping around the ground and car like fish. Youth can't be leaving the theaters thinking the criminals get away with it, no matter how much we may be rooting for them. Hamer left a message \u2014 and a scene \u2014 that has gone down in history. Bonnie and Clyde is a cinephile's staple and a glimpse into a Hollywoodified period-piece on the Dust Bowl, Great Depression, and two American legends.",

They are eventually shot to death in a bloody massacre by the police pursuing after one of their closest allies betrays them due to his belief that they are a negative influence on his innocent relative.\n\nI must admit that I was rather shocked how quickly the film jumped into it's plot as usually with a film from this time period it takes at least an hour to lay out who the characters are at what the main conflict of the film will be. Not so in this film as we see our two protagonists meet, fall in love and begin robbing banks together within a matter of minutes. It takes a little while longer for Buck and Blanche to become involved but even so the disgruntlement of law enforcement and the effect of the media on their lives is seen early on in the film and from there it doesn't let up. This odd cast of characters spend their time stealing money and riding away in a rundown car in a fit of glee and we get to see all of that joy and excitement as they peel off down back roads and roll around in the back of the car. You are drawn into their breathless excitement and enjoyment because they have the gall to begin shooting people and stealing money without a second thought, they don't need to have their audience really get to know them over time because their characters are clearly established in the space of seconds. Arthur Penn knew exactly what he was doing by having this crazy couple come together immediately and audiences lapped up this change of pace.\n\nMany will remember Dunaway, looking flawless, strolling into a bank and brandishing a gun and fortunately there are several scenes that give her an opportunity to do just that thing but deeper emotional depths are revealed. When she finally sees her mother again after so long away from her she is able to display all of the ambivalence and fear that she has kept below the surface during her time with the confident Barrow. The expression of pain on her face after facing her mother's cool, emotionless rejection of her romantic ideals is quite touching as the girl who puts on a \"sexy\" Southern drawl and seems to be forever posing has her humanity brought forth. Beatty is less interesting as the rather more straightforward Barrow as while he gets the job done he is ultimately not what you remember about the film. Parsons' Best Supporting Actress win is rather perplexing as she gives a hammy, hysterical performance that does not hint at the range that come with Rachel, Rachel (1968) while Hackman is typically brilliant as the rowdy Buck.\n\nThis is one that you must absolutely watch as it had an undeniable impact on the development of films in the late 1960s into the 1970s and still stands up today.",

            "content": "The outrageous criminal love couple on the run!\n\nArthur Penn directed the crime thriller that put the blood and grit into Hollywood films forevermore: Bonnie & Clyde (1967). Penn uses squibs for blood and riddles bodies with bullets like audiences had never seen before Bonnie & Clyde. This is as influential as crime thrillers gets as Bonnie & Clyde influenced Badlands, Thelma & Louise, True Romance, and Natural Born Killers to name a few.\n\nArthur Penn's direction was the perfect director to balance character moments with gripping shootouts. I like how he just lets scenes play out. I love the banjo score theme song that is \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\" by Flatt and Scruggs is the perfect mood setter for Bonnie & Clyde. It's high octane speed and playful tone fit the infamous crime duo's dramatic flair and vicious acts.\n\nBonnie Parker is depicted by Faye Dunaway as an alluring, if near sociopathic killer seeking love and dangerous. Dunaway is lovely and dreamy as Bonnie, but quickly all her sheen disappears as you realize she is just bored and needy. She uses Clyde for her own sick kicks to get an adrenaline rush out of robbery and murder of innocent people. Dunaway's greatest role will forever be as Bonnie because she charms you to distract you from her inner dissatisfaction.\n\nWarren Beatty's portrayal of Clyde Barrow is strange as he's oddly likable for a serial killer and chronic bank robber. He's depicted as sensitive, yet absolutely capable and willing to commit murder at a moment's notice. Beatty is charming, but also brutal as he fires off countless rounds at the police and bystanders alike. I'd say Bonnie & Clyde is also Warren Beatty's best acting as he manages a nuanced portrayal of a complex mythic figure in criminal history.\n\nI really enjoyed Gene Hackman's supporting role as Clyde's brother Buck Barrow. Hackman's eager and excitable personality gives Buck a magnetic persona. Estelle Parsons is hilarious as Blanche Barrow, Buck's hysterical and conservative wife. I appreciated Michael J. Pollard's portrayal of C.W. Moss as a dim witted, yet sincere youth bent on the excitement of crime. I am amazed by Dub Taylor's tough father figure Ivan Moss. Denver Pyle is solid and steadfast as Frank Hamer.\n\nI must mention Gene Wilder gets a hilarious cameo as Eugene Grizzard in his film debut! Penn also cast a non-actress, Mabel Cavitt, as Bonnie's mother. She is apt as the nervous mother worried that her daughter will end up dead by the law if she continues her dangerous path.\n\nIn all, Bonnie & Clyde is an entertaining and thoughtful film well crafted by Arthur Penn.",

            "content": "Producer/star Warren Beatty had to convince Warner Bros. to finance this film, which went on to become the studio's second-highest grosser. It also caused major controversy by redefining violence in cinema and casting its criminal protagonists as sympathetic anti-heroes. Based loosely on the true exploits of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker during the 30s, the film begins as Clyde (Beatty) tries to steal the car of Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway)'s mother. Bonnie is excited by Clyde's outlaw demeanor, and he further stimulates her by robbing a store in her presence. Clyde steals a car, with Bonnie in tow, and their legendary crime spree begins. The two move from town to town, pulling off small heists, until they join up with Clyde's brother Buck (Gene Hackman), his shrill wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons), and a slow-witted gas station attendant named C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard). The new gang robs a bank and Clyde is soon painted in the press as a Depression-era Robin Hood when he allows one bank customer to hold onto his money. Soon the police are on the gang's trail and they are constantly on the run, even kidnapping a Texas Ranger (Denver Pyle) and setting him adrift on a raft, handcuffed, after he spits in Bonnie's face when she kisses him. That same ranger leads a later raid on the gang that leaves Buck dying, Blanche captured, and both Clyde and Bonnie injured. The ever-loyal C.W. takes them to his father's house. C.W.'s father disaproves his son's affiliation with gangsters and enters a plea bargain with the Texas Rangers. A trap is set that ends in one of the bloodiest death scenes in cinematic history. The film made stars out of Beatty and Dunaway, and it also featured the screen debut of Gene Wilder as a mortician briefly captured by the gang. Its portrayal of Bonnie and Clyde as rebels who empathized with the poor working folks of the 1930s struck a chord with the counterculture of the 1960s and helped generate a new, young audience for American movies that carried over into Hollywood's renewal of the 1970s. Its combination of sex and violence with dynamic stars, social relevance, a traditional Hollywood genre, and an appeal to hip young audiences set the pace for many American movies to come.",

As the title suggests, it follows the exploits of the notorious 1930's crime duo, Bonnie and Clyde, who along with other accomplices committed a string of bank robberies and numerous murders before being gunned down themselves. It's not exactly historically accurate, which comes with the territory regarding films about real people, but damn is it an entertaining film not just because of the terrific action sequences, but also because of the star power and chemistry of Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway who elevate this film into something truly great. Their characters are bad people, but you will still enjoy their antihero personas whether it be in drama or just playful banter between them. The film is also a reflection of not just the turmoil of the Great Depression, but also the era the film itself released, giving viewers a morbid glimpse into freedom and bucking authority in a tumultuous time.

I could have summarized everything I knew about Bonnie and Clyde in a sentence or two, and literally that was all that happened in the entire film. It\u2019s a lot of robbing, a lot of hiding out, a bit of murdering, and a fitting end. But there\u2019s not much more to the plot than that, aside from a few short detours along the way. In between all of the chaos there is a concerted effort put into establishing and developing characters, so that you will sympathize and find a way to care for these criminals. They have some interesting relationships within their gang, and each time a new member is brought into the fold they come with new personality and problems. That was nice because the growth of the gang was when we actually see some variety in the way the robberies play out. There were elements of the story that felt like a cautionary tale about the dangers that can come from being impulsive and living life on the edge instead of being content. However, I would have liked some kind of setup in the beginning that gave a stronger sense of why the two main characters were willing to go down this path instead of settling. As it is presented, we just see them meet, and within 5 minutes they have robbed someone and are fleeing for their lives. This works when you\u2019re trying to establish how quickly they are swept up in this life, but it doesn\u2019t help when we are expected to guess why they continue instead of getting out before things get worse. The same setup/backstory would be nice with each new member of the gang, because almost everyone seems to jump in just for the fun of it. The actors were all excellent, and that\u2019s the biggest asset Bonnie and Clyde has going for it. When I would ordinarily hate these people because they are despicable murderers and robbers, I was able to connect with them a little more because they were played so well by actors I love. Even the small parts were great, including an amazing cameo from Gene Wilder. That\u2019s what kept me engaged for the full movie, despite the fact that the actual plot was excessively repetitive and not all that interesting to me. I also thought the film did a poor job of trying to make you side with the gang. Sure we get to see them laughing, having fun, and occasionally sparing a life, but none of that was enough to justify anything they were doing. We never get justifiable motivations in Bonnie and Clyde, so that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t care about how it all ended.",

The movie also benefits from a well written script that keeps the audience hooked all the way from beginning to end.  It even has a few laughs here and there.  Most are provided by the late Gene Wilder in his feature film debut.  As great as the movie is, it does have a few minor flaws.  The basic story of this film is that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow are actually very good people at heart who don't mean to be ruthless robbers and killers.  They were forced into their situation because the big, evil and heartless banks are hurting the little man and they want some payback.  There is the formulaic scene where as they are robbing a bank, they let an elderly farmer keep the money he was planning to deposit because they want that bank's money, not his.  We also get the scene where Clyde tells Bonnie's mother that they don't plan to lead a life of crime forever and hope to go straight.  In away these flaws show the film's influence in the sense that we see echoes of these plot devices in future movies.  The robbers don't want your money, they want the bank's money (\"Heat\" \"Hell or High Water\").  The banks with their evil ways of doing business force good people to do bad things (Again \"Hell or High Water\".).  The bad guys promise to to become legitimate very soon (\"The Godfather\".).  Despite these flaws, I say that this movie remains Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway's crowning achievement in their celebrated careers and is well worth seeing.  Fifty years after the movie's original release, it is still just as powerful and entertaining now as it was then.",

I guess back in those times early 1930's, you could get away with doing a lot more shit than today. Especially if your out in the countryside and not in any metropolitan area.  \n\nKind of a dose of reality when the owner of that rundown house shows up and tells them that the bank took there house. It was reassuring to se them kind of get back at them by shooting the house and the bank sign up. And then society thinks that criminals are the ones who are robbing banks and stuff when the banks are the real criminals. It was really funny when he went to the bank to rob it, and then finds out the bank recently had to close down. Meanwhile the guy still working there things it's all a joke and doesn't even take the robbery serious.\n\nInteresting to see that Clyde was asexual. He can't find it in him to have sex. Gene Hackman is always great to watch. He's got this unbelievable charm. That was pretty damn hilarious how Buck's wife just kept screaming while the law was shooting at them, but damn that was stupid of her. Clyde really knows how to shoot a gun. Holy shit, I can't believe the officer spit in Bonnie's face! She was just trying to be friendly. It's intersting how family got involved in there crimes like Clyde's brother. I love when there making faces through the car's window when they stop Eugene's car. It just show how lighthearted this movie is. That was real nice that they got to spend time with family. Even though they're crooks, they haven't forgotten the importance of family. That last look they gave each other before they got shot down was really something special.

Clyde does not want to have sex, Bonnie wants to do something other than be on the run forever, Clyde wants to look out for his family but at the same time Bonnie hates Blanche, etc. However, at the end of the day, these two really love each other more than anything and always come back to one another despite their conflicts, and the two leads portrayed that beautifully.

The story was well-performed by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway as the titular pair with Gene Hackman as the bonus treat when  enjoying this nicely-followed biopic. On the ending note, the notable fate that'd done most of the job to give this a film a reputation based on how well it was executed and how it proved its matching power of the atmosphere.\n\nThe original \"Bonnie and Clyde\" feature may be violent and has strange behavior among its characters, but it was well-made on being typically mostly accurate while the performances and the cinematography expressed the story well while matching the power - an ability that most or some biopics possessed. It's a film with the winning materials that'll bring you the enjoyment you'll mostly appreciate if ignoring the violence and the strangeness would be helpful to have a satisfying experience than knowing the basic fact and fate.

It would be na\u00efve to assume that this was just an objectively historical film. Instead, this is a film from the perspective of Bonnie and Clyde, and for something like that, it's actually pretty good. It's a fine example of a movie that takes its time before culminating in a memorable conclusion. The performances were quite realistic, given the context of the film's setting. The film's leading couple make for a rather effective pair of performers, and they seem to suit the role like the clothes they wear. The other characters tend to fade in and out of the background, but there really aren't any bad performances. The film's overall style does give off a kind of corny hillbilly feel, but thankfully, it doesn't happen all the time, and by the end, the mood of the film is irreversibly different. It's impossible to expect a film about two criminals to go without violence, and this film delivers it sparingly, before the film's famously violent climax. To be honest, nothing's wrong with this movie, but it's not as good as some of the other films that have been considered \"classics\". That said, however, it's still enjoyable in its own way.",

This is the glamorized telling of the true story.  A lot of what makes this work as well as it does is the glorification of it all; it isn't really all that compelling of a story when you break it down, but when you have Beatty bringing the cool confidence and Dunaway flaunting sex appeal, it suddenly becomes accessible.  They make stealing cars and robbing banks seem appealing and like a blast, until that time arrives when it becomes overwhelming.  These are fully rounded characters that have a lot brewing underneath the surface, Bonnie especially; it is very interesting to see the way she reacts to the celebrity of it all, as it is such a drastic change of lifestyles.  They also share a great back and forth together, so when they first meet at the beginning of the story, you fully buy that they are hitting it off.  This may be more violent than you remember, and all of the gunplay leads to a very disturbing finale.  This is gritty, irresistible, and every note in between.",

            "content": "With new attention being drawn to the story, having spawned a History Channel miniseries, I thought it time to visit the acclaimed 1967 Bonnie and Clyde. Receiving large praise for its ingenuity and boldness, Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde can rightly be called a classic. It's a film ahead of its time in approach, style, and execution. \n\nWatching Penn's Bonnie and Clyde, one might forget the way it redefined cinema for its time. This is a testament to how it has aged, being almost indistinguishable, and in many ways better, than modern films. The violence in this film is unflinching, not sanitized, but also not over-glamorized. The characterizations are surprisingly fresh and bold, casting two anti-heroes, both with deeply flawed personas and hints of even social taboos.\n\nThe film progresses at a brisk pace, yet never feels rushed. Penn guides the narrative in a way that feels organic and engaging, giving us necessary back-story, but never feeling the need to pander. The hallmark of the film is the central performances from Warren Beatty and Fay Dunaway. Both have a palpable chemistry, and both bring an enormous amount of charisma to the screen. Dunaway is perfect as the lonely, thrill-seeking, and self-destructive Bonnie Parker, and Beatty is superb as the vulnerable, yet dogged Clyde Barrow. These performances are set against strong action scenes, and within a script that emphasizes the characters, never attempting to force-thrills.\n\nThe one criticism of Penn's Bonnie and Clyde is the historical accuracy. To be sure, we expect liberties to be taken, and Penn's version is certainly more true than others, yet the film subscribes to some of the more dubious notions about the couple. The hints of Clyde's impotence, for example, seem to be a substitute for other questions regarding his sexuality, yet substance for this is lacking, with an actually and intense romantic relationship between the two being likely more accurate.\n\nA strong film overall, largely befitting its classic status.\n\n4/5 Stars",

The signs of death hang heavy over the story, and even if you didn't know of the historic ends of the two real-life outlaws beforehand, it's very clear that this movie could only have ended one way. The famous final scene is simply jaw-dropping. This can be a difficult film to parse, particularly where it stands in regards to the moral lines that are drawn (we can't help but like and root for the gang at times; on the other hand, the film clearly portrays them as vicious and selfish, needing to be brought to justice). I imagine that's the point.Beatty and Dunaway are truly excellent, Gene Hackman is rowdy and real, and the short sequence featuring the screen-debut of Gene Wilder is maybe the best, funniest scene in the whole movie. Michael J. Pollard as C.W. also gives a fascinating and subtle performance. Estelle Parsons' (Oscar-winning) role as Blanche really got on my nerves, and I felt the film retread some character beats one too many times during the middle-third, but \"Bonnie and Clyde\" still stands as an incredibly visceral cinematic experience.",

            "content": "Before The Godfather, Bonnie and Clyde was a film that did not romanticize crime or glorify it as a fun way of life, but as a sad existence. This movie has many levels of depth and ideas, but the one that stuck to me most was the willingness to show that the gangster life is not one of getting money. Or getting to say \"see?\" and \"ohh a wise guy eh?\" but a story of real humans. Bonnie and Clyde do not intend to harm anyone, but they search for a better life in crime that they believe nothing else can offer. Instead, we see that they are in a downward spiral to a very gory and harrowing death. In a very stark and realistic moment, the camera does not give us a sweeping or epic shot of the car to suggest the ending of a legend. Rather, it shows us the death of two people who were searching for something and never found it. All we see are the sad expressions of the lawmen looking upon them. Not boastful or prideful in their accomplishment in ending the spree of some extremely deadly and famous criminals, but mournful and reflective. This shows us that Bonnie and Clyde were not criminals who should be cheered over after they've been killed, but people like us who searched for the wrong thing. Near the end of the film, Bonnie says \"You know what, when we started out, I thought we was really goin' somewhere. This is it. We're just goin', huh?\" The 60's people would like us to believe this is a story of two gangsters who shun authority, live life on their own terms and do what they want.  When in reality, when you shun all of your authority and just do what you want, you're not finding the answers. You're just goin'.",

It is true that the real Bonnie Parker was a waitress in West Dallas, Texas when she ran into Clyde Barrow. They say women are attracted to bad boys, but Bonnie took that to the extreme as she left home to join Clyde on a multi-state Robbing and Murder Spree. That eventually ended in the two of them being shot to death along a country road.",

I mean good god, this movie was extraordinarily well made, and I don't give a shit how historically accurate it is.  This one was about the characters within the legend and Arthur Penn made a masterpiece.  It even has Estelle Parsons as maybe the most annoying character ever put on film, yet it works (but I'll be damned if I didn't wanna see that whiny cunt get a mouthful of buckshots).  I really did forget that this is one of the greatest films of all time.",

            "content": "Bonnie and Clyde is a violent and in a way a romance, at times the film really does glorify violence in which when the film was released was controversial due to showing the impact of what being shot is really like compared to films which would mask violence using editing techniques.\nThe film also glorifies what love is, it's that first encounter when you fall in love. The film is also quite erotic using personifications and the film is shot in such a way that resembling French new wave, when Bonnie and Clyde first take a walk into town and figure each other out, Clyde pulls out a gun using extreme close ups of Bonnie stroking the gun while she fondles with a bottle around her lips, you only need to add things up to put things into a sexual connotation.\nAlthough the film seems a mythical legend an awful lot the film is based on reality, a beautiful couple who rob banks and are on the run. The film has been referenced so much to the point that i knew the story of Bonnie and Clyde before i even saw the film.\nWhat the actors performances give to the film is in reality the way story's are skewed, we see peoples lives and personalitys without judging them. Warren Beatty is a man who looks almost comical, while Bonnie is innocent and wants more in her life than been a waitress, the two were destined to meet.\nOverall Bonnie and Clyde is a film based on two principles love and violence, we as humans have no more response to these two emotions. In a way i think the film is quite funny at times, it is great to watch the character development, Bonnie becomes more confident and also so does Clyde when robbing the banks. Although the film is often referenced today, the film then also references things like DW Griffith with the wacky car chases and cross cutting between two sets of different things going on like when a bank is robbed and they are been chased, the witnesses in the bank are glorifying the gang.",
