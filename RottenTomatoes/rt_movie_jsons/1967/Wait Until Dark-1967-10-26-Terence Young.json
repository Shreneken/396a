So many impossible to comprehend things happen in this movie that it is amazing anyone ever took this seriously.  Gasoline is dumped all over a small enclosed room, then matches and torches of paper are lit amidst all the fumes and nothing happens?  A doll stuffed with a small amount of heroin is desperately and painstakingly sought by people who never take the time to simply look for it, even though it is in the same room they are in the entire time?  Laughable in many ways.  High ratings are hard to understand for this awkwardly fumbling clunker.",

It's a story of a young blind woman (Audrey Hepburn) being manipulated by three criminals. Henry Mancini's musical score is quite nail-biting and intense as the score that he composed fits the film's tone and atmosphere. The acting from Audrey Hepburn and Alan Arkin are phenomenal performances as the two battle their wits during the film's climax. Wait Until Dark is such an intense thriller that makes you want to scream when the film gets quite intriguing.",

Very well acted out, the movie brings out the bitterness of a thriller without exaggerating its criminal elements. Not one second throughout the running time did I feel uninterested, let alone bored, and it is indeed very rare to find this in any movie, even the greatest of them. The plot is very creatively woven, the pacing is perfect, and the direction is great, especially taking into consideration that most of the movie is set in one place and that it involved shooting in the \"dark.\" Audrey Hepburn of course gives a great performance as always and so do the rest of the cast, but she specifically plays a blind woman so meticulously it is weirdly alluring. Wait Until Dark is ultimately what cinema was made to be: compelling.",

It's  a bit forced in its basic premises to make sure Suzy, a blind woman, is alone at home while three criminals attempt to get a doll from her husband. The doll was given to him and is stuffed with heroin - unbeknownst to him.  One way or the other, Suzy is by herself and thus the movie is full of suspense. It really follows its theater version. It unfolds mostly in the apartment - which increases the drama level but also gets dull. Wished they made use more of film tools. For example, we never see the world from Suzy's perspective, which is a pity; it would add a lot to the drama of the movie. In any case, one can well imagine her angst. The series of events would unsettle anyone despite their sight. Her husband's response  to her blindness is a bit cold, coming from the place of you can do it, and now you can… a bit odd. The girl who lives upstairs is apparently all by herself - they covered that too, coming up with some silly excuse for that. Anyway, it's a good movie despite some flaws in the story",

            "content": "Chilling atmosphere with eerie music, and haunting direction.\n\nIrish director Terence Young's horror crime thriller Wait Until Dark (1967) is still unnerving. Young lets his suspense thriller breathe with characters constantly reacting to every little sound and movement during this tense home invasion film. It's a very unique and specific story about a blind woman getting gaslit by two robbers and a murderer as they want to search her home for a little doll. Young makes Wait Until Dark get scarier and scarier until you feel like Audrey Hepburn is trapped.\n\nWriters Frederick Knott, Robert Carrington, and Jane-Howard Hammerstein create an enthralling horror narrative that makes you feel so nervous and sorry for Audrey Hepburn's lone woman trying to figure out this brewing mystery as she's being lied to by everyone around her. I'm impressed that Wait Until Dark is so meticulously detail oriented about every clue and hint about what happened to this doll and where it could be as these robbers frantically search and manipulate their way into this home.\n\nIt's neat seeing all the Montreal and New York sights in the backdrop and 1960's fashion everywhere. Producer Mel Ferrer really got Young neat locations. He cameos as the voice of the Canadian radio speaker too! George Jenkins' art direction makes a quaint New York apartment look sinister and a menacing place to be. George James Hopkins & Ward Preston's set decoration provides all these cute knick-knacks for Hepburn's home that looks like you could live there.\n\nYoung's direction is fascinating with his chilling atmosphere and intimate feel like you're right there. Wait Until Dark is similar to Alfred Hitchcock's Rope all in one location and features killers maneuvering around Gene Milford's artful cuts that keep you in suspense with these seamless cuts that flow from room to room. 108 minutes pass by in moments. Charles Lang's cinematography goes from sweeping panning shots outdoors to these sharp shots indoors that hold your attention on the necessary details. The unique way Wait Until Dark is shot lets your eyes linger on every detail of this home as the mystery unfolds. \n\nAudrey Hepburn is delightful and sympathetic as Susy Hendrix. Her acting as if she's blind is really entertaining and moving. You feel her frustrations and fears, while admiring her acute sense of hearing, space, and movements. I found Hepburn very charming and engaging as you're always aware of when she's picking up on when she is being lied to by these three criminals. Audrey Hepburn was so pretty and captivating in every second of Wait Until Dark.\n\nAlan Arkin is captivating as the mysterious Roat with his unnerving manner of speech and knife Geraldine. He plays multiple roles with a real sinister malice to his villain Roat. Richard Crenna is intriguing as the enigmatic Mike Talman. He plays the two-faced crook who is directly gaslighting Hepburn with such ease and confidence. Crenna looks like an evil Roger Moore. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is good as Hepburn's often absent husband Sam, who can be both dispassionate and caring. Jack Weston is fun as the suspicious and self-serving Detective Carlino. He's very forceful and eager as he lies and intimidates his way for information.\n\nSamantha Jones is lovely as Lisa. She's the spitting image of Sharon Tate. She pulls off her doll handoff very well. Julie Herrod is excellent as the young girl Gloria. Her tantrums and casual observations are a nice juxtaposition to Hepburn's graceful composure. Jean Del Val cameos as the old man who makes the doll for Jones' Lisa.\n\nComposer Henry Mancini's creepy score is simply haunting. His dissonant chord stab and eerie piano melodies plucking away. He goes from diabolical sounding classical pieces to softer jazz passages at times. I love the music throughout Wait Until Dark. Sound designer Everett A. Hughes' very particular use of sound really emphasizes just exactly what Hepburn's blind lady can hear. Every mistake the crooks make is noted by her through her hearing. Gordon Bau really gave Hepburn a natural glow with his make-up too.\n\nIn short, I thoroughly enjoyed Wait Until Dark. It is an underrated suspense thriller that's often forgotten, but well worth seeking out. If you've ever liked Hitchcock's pictures, then Terence Young's Wait Until Dark has something special in store for you.",

While the first half of the film is a bit convoluted and implausible, the second half more than compensates, with a finale that won't be forgotten and possibly the king of all jump scares.

Arkin's gang doesn't want to make a scene if they don't have to - they're just after the dope-stuffed doll that fell into her possession - but patience wears thin as their con act falters and she continues dodging questions.\n\nIt's a promising setup, if a little dull in practice, but neither of the against-type primary roles really click. Hepburn is sweet but stiff in her central role, out-of-place in an unfamiliar genre, while Arkin's twisted erudite hipster is more of a hand-wringing silver age comic book villain than the dark, gritty, street-level threat he's obviously meant to be. A crafty final showdown between the pair levels the playing field, smartly ratcheting tension in a string of almost pitch-black struggles over a knife, a fridge door and a can of gasoline. That scene was the subject of much promotion during the film's original run, aided by a gimmick that had theater-owners extinguish all lighting (even the exit signs?) to enhance the effect. The white-knuckled climax works well enough, and I'm sure the atmospheric bonus would've been a neat wrinkle, but it's insufficient compensation for the half-cooked hour of water-treading that precedes it.",

            "content": "1967 film Wait Until Dark, adapted from Frederick Knott's 1966 play - and that is a considerable amount, given that it's one of the greatest movie thrillers of its generation - my first question is this: what on earth goes through Audrey Hepburn's mind when she's asked to appear in this movie? You have here a woman whose screen persona is completely built around her classy Continental elegance, whose personal life was marked by serious-minded humanitarianism, and you drop her into a horror-thriller about a heroin dealer antagonising a blind woman - it all seems so incomprehensible that Hepburn's seventeenth starring role should be such a grubby, grotty turn from all of the princesses and doe-eyed gamines and society women . Well it payed off big .\nAudrey Hepburn received her fifth (and last) Oscar nomination for effectively playing a blind woman in this well-executed thriller based on the Broadway smash hit; equally good are the villains, played by the young Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna. . I would go so far as to say that Hepburn's blend of weakness and fortitude is the key ingredient to everything else in Wait Until Dark, providing exactly the correct note of nervous ambivalence that makes this such a superlative, viscerally effective thriller.",

            "content": "Wait Until Dark: 4 out of 10: A filmed version of a play about a blind woman who is terrorized by a trio of thugs when her husband accidentally acquires a child's doll filled with heroin.\n\nThe Good: Richard Crenna is actually quite good in this. Unfortunately, I really wasn't a fan of the other actors. Audrey Hepburn was okay as the blind woman (an Oscar nomination really?) but Alan Arkin really does ham it up as the chief baddie (more on that below). The biggest offender, however, is Samantha Jones as the child upstairs that helps out. There is no acting quite as bad as an overacting child actor and we definitely have a culprit here.\n\nI am sorry I am supposed to be talking about the positives here. There ending is a hoot and there are some quality jump scares in the film.\n\nThe Bad: Wait Until Dark would have worked a lot better if it took place in suburbia or on a farm. Many (not all) of the glaring plot holes are simply because it takes place in the city. Roger Ebert liked the movie overall but spent the entire review wondering why a newly blind woman alone in a New York basement apartment leaves her door unlocked over and over again even after she feels in danger. You were not alone Roger, you were not alone. \n\nThe Ugly: Let's talk Alan Arkin for a minute. Part of Wait Until Dark's reputation is that Alan Arkin is such a devilish bad guy. He does play a complete bastard I will give you that. He also hams it up like he was in a Pink Panther film. He is so in Pink Panther mode he enters the apartment each time wearing an elaborate costume and makeup doing exaggerated movements to really sell the con... to Audrey Hepburn's character... who is blind. \n\nThis movie has a great reputation and I have no idea why. I would love to say it is seeing tiny Audrey Hepburn going around her apartment blind threatened by these bad men. Why are they threatening her? There is zero reason for them to threaten her. The entire plot is based on a premise that simply doesn't pass go. Since neither she nor her husband thinks the doll is anything more than a child's toy that needs to be returned why not just knock on the door and ask for the doll. And if they can't find it right away ask them to look for it and check back later in the week. \n.\nI mean the movie is full of these conundrums. Roger Ebert also wondered why Audrey Hepburn sent the upstairs girl to the Port Authority Bus terminal instead of to the Police to get help. I like to think she was trying to get that horrible child kidnapped by a pimp (It is New York City in 1967). Indeed who sends a young girl with the emotional maturity of boiled cabbage to the Port Authority on a very wild goose chase unless one has dark motives. \n\n\nIn Conclusion: If you want to see a one-room play done right with no tricks see Dial M for Murder which actually shares the same playwright (Frederic Knott) as Wait Until Dark. One can have a movie swimming in plot holes if the action onscreen holds ones attention just as one can have a slow talky film as long as the story and script keeps one invested. Unfortunately, a very slow talky claustrophobic film that allows the audience to start questioning everything that happens on screen is in for a world of hurt. The ending is effective though I can see why people remember the last fifteen minutes. It is just getting there that is such a drag.",

            "content": "Wait Until Dark is a movie that isn’t what I was anticipating. While it is structured around Audrey Hepburn as a blind woman and a group of crooks trying to get something out of her place, I didn’t realize they were going to have this elaborate ruse. I do like the con game and it has some tension in it since we know the truth, but it took a long time until I was actually worried about her safety. Richard Crenna plays his role so amiable that I didn’t think he would do anything to hurt our leading lady. This works for his character, but doesn’t add to the drama of the story. Alan Arkin was the curveball in the entire narrative. His slightly unhinged and deranged performance was exactly what I was looking for out of this movie, and his final scenes brought the thriller aspect that I was expecting to feel throughout the film. It’s undercut a little when he takes on the costumes and accents of other characters, but I don’t mind because the setup in the beginning made him threatening enough to overcome a little silliness. There were even a couple of scenes where they used complete darkness, and that was a great way to keep you holding your breath in tension. On reflecting I can’t help wondering if Wait Until Dark would have worked just a little better if they had structured it without the opening sequence so we didn’t know what was going on, and we were experiencing the mystery with Susy. I know they would have needed to tweak a few things in the script in order to make that a viable way of telling the story. I just wonder if it’s best for us to be worried about her from the beginning or puzzled and confused with her, trying to figure out the mystery. Either way, I did enjoy the movie and thought the way Susy pieces things together is engaging. It might not have quite lived up to my personal hype, but that doesn’t mean it was flawed. I’ll try to watch Wait Until Dark again sometime and I think without skewed expectations it will work even better.",

            "content": "As a teenager, I used to take the subway into Manhattan Saturday mornings and go to the movies. One of the most memorable of these films was without a doubt 'Wait Until Dark'. This taut thriller still stands far above other more recent entries into this genre. The reason for this persistence in excellence is this film does not depend on the typical slasher flicks special effects. These blood and gore scenes are good for a moment but soon become old. Wait Until Dark depends more on the human mind, a technique that can thrill far more than any fake blood and dismembered body parts. Susy (Audrey Hepburn) is a young woman who lives in New York City, is married to a successful photographer (Efrem Zimbalist Jr), and she is blind. While her husband is on a business trip, a beautiful blond slips a doll into his belongings, one that conceals a large quantity of heroin. The blond winds up dead (in Suzy's apartment), and the doll is also somewhere in the apartment. The main crook Roat (Alan Arkin) is determined to get the drugs back and deceptively enlists the aid of two other criminals, Mike (Richard Crenna) and Carlino (Jack Weston). The three men will pose as police officers to deceive the poor blind girl into letting them into the apartment where they can search for the drug right under her nose.\n\nWhat ensues is a brilliantly orchestrated cat and mouse game largely between Roan and Suzy which itself sets this film above the typical Hollywood thriller. Rather than sitting back and surrendering to gory effects the audience is expected to think, to truly care about Suzy and root for her survival. Suzy is not the usual hapless damsel in distress; she is bright, resourceful and perceptive, more than a match for the clever Roat. Being blind turns out not to be a disadvantage to Suzy. It gives her the ability to notice little things the sighted would have overlooked. Things like furniture slightly moved the constant playing with the window blinds (a signal between the crooks) and the movements of the men throughout her apartment. It dawns on Suzy that something is amiss and she begins to prepare for the worse. While not a criminal mastermind Roat devises a plan that seemingly is brilliant. He underestimates how easy it will be to fool the blind woman but the manner in which he manipulates the other two men is inspired. The ending is shrouded in darkness. When I saw this film in my youth, the gimmick was for the theater to dim the house lights to the edge of the legal limit to accentuate the tension. It did, and I remember it now several decades later. You might want to try this at home.\n\nOne of the factors that help to propel this film to the heights it has achieved is the cast. Audrey Hepburn takes a character that normally would be considered helpless and turns her around into a sharp and incredibly bright young woman. Her performance lulls the audience into accepting her as determined but physically helpless only to watch her inner strength and determination forced to the surface. There is a spectacular beauty to how Hepburn places the character development of Suzy carefully, gradually allowing the audience's empathy to grow. Little hints to the self-reliance given from the start but as the film progresses we see just how strong she is. Arkin gives the performance of his lifetime here. He plays three characters in his plot against Suzy, Roat, Roat Jr. and Roat Sr. the subtle difference in how he plays each role is an exhibition of how an actor should approach a character. What impressed me most here is the amount of control these two leads display. They take the time and effort required to allow the audience to get to know these people, what motivates them and what is behind their reactions. Crenna and Weston give solid performances as the ancillary characters here. Each of these two men is capable of strong performances, and they give them to us. As low-level crooks, they are baited by Roat, manipulated and controlled by him. Their desperation is visceral; the audience can feel the emotions these men hold just under the surface.\n\nDirector Terence Young knows how to please an audience. He is responsible for three of the early (and best) James Bind films, 'Doctor No,' 'From Russia with Love' and 'Thunderball.' You may wonder if a director used to such action-oriented films can handle a far more cerebral thriller, the answer is a resounding yes. His control of the all important pacing is gifted. While most thrillers seem to feel that an initial shock required at the start of the film, Young give the audience time to acclimate to the situations and characters. He develops the plot slowly, like a fine dinner left to simmer and merges the flavors. He exhibits the same control of the lighting. Due to the specifics of this film, this is even greater than usual. As the ending approaches the lights dim, one by one, darkening the theater reinforcing the events on screen. Shadows become something out of a nightmare as our concern for the plight of Suzy increases. Young manipulates the emotions of the audience to perfection.\n\nThis film is an astounding example how actors, each great in their right, can interact with such amazing perfection that the synergy derived by the cast is nothing short of brilliant. Mr. Zimbalist and Mr. Weston were so brilliant in their portrayal of the soldier villains Mike and Carlino that a substantial baseline established the foundation for the coming terror flawlessly.\n\nIt is the cat and mouse game between the ruthless, expertly driven criminal and a young blind woman that takes the suspense and escalating terror to heights beyond any expectations the audience might have brought into the theater. Overall the mastering of this Blu-ray is excellent. Considering the age of the source material, you can expect some variation in the balance of light and dark scenes. The slight grain found in the previous DVD release was eradicated during the 'upgrading process' to high definition. The source material had to be a near pristine 35mm to achieve such a crisp video. Especially appreciated is the greater clarity in the many dimly lit scenes. The nature of the story requires the set be in nearly total darkness. On the DVDthe figures are little more than dark gray blobs, now transformed into discernable characters. Among the strongest reasons I had driving my excitement to receive a copy of this release for preview was the thought od experiencing a favorite film with video and audio superior to my initial viewing so many years ago.\n\nPresenting the soundtrack in its original mono format is always appreciated by film purists. Altering the video's aspect ratio is tantamount to heresy, but fewer cinephiles are that concerned with alterations to the audio. The source material didn't provide a lot of sound elements to process, but the transition to DTS High Definition Audio allowed for a robust spectrum of the audio. It comes across as a bit more oriented to center stage, reinforcing the overall feel and look which emulates a live stage performance. There are no extremes in bass or treble here. On the plus side, it does give a live stage feel to the film. I watched this film bypassing the bit stream audio and using the Prologic 'Live' mode for more a theatrical feel to the experience. The extras are interesting. There is a stroll down memory lane by Alan Arkin and producer Mel Ferrer detailing just what went into the making of this classic. There is also a little featurette chronicling how this adaptation of this work from the original stage production. Rounding out the extras are a few trailers. Don't 'wait,' get this one Blu-ray even if you already own the Blu-ray and enjoy a great film experience.",

Alan Arkin is fantastic as the ruthless drug dealer who schemes with a couple of characters played by Richard Crenna and Jack Weston to trick Hepburn into letting them into her home, in search of a doll that was used to smuggle heroin and which ended up in her husband's possession.  The film is not 100% convincing and you'll probably find yourself pointing out a few plot holes, but it's convincing enough, and I liked how taut the story-telling was.  What could be more eerie than thinking you're alone in your apartment, but have three men with you in the room?   We feel for this vulnerable blind woman and pull for her as she begins to figure out what's happening by paying attention to her other senses (and getting some help from a neighbor girl), and there is real tension as she does.  You'll have to suspend disbelief a little bit to enjoy it, but it's certainly worth watching.",

Wait Until Dark takes those fears to a new level, when it takes the premise of a main character being newly blind and being stalked by a thug in her own apartment. Audrey Hepburn does a fantastic job as a blind woman who is being pushed around, conned, and forced into letting a man into her apartment while her husband is away, all because her husband brought her a doll, which unknown to both of them had drugs inside. Alan Arkin is terrific as a bad man who will stop at nothing to get his drugs, even stooping so low as to trick a blind woman. The fear and terror that sits at the heart of Wait Until Dark is simple, if you can't see, you can never be certain your truly alone, and that is a fear that most people can easily understand. For the most part the acting in Wait Until Dark is very good, with Hepburn standing out as usual, but Arkin was very good as a bad guy, which I never would have thought possible as he is always seen as a kinder gentler character for most of his films. It does drag a little in the middle, and the kid gives a regularly bad kid performance, but on the whole Wait Until Dark is a well put together thriller that hits the right notes for most of it running time.\n\n3.5 Beards Out Of 5",

            "content": "A chilling film, even by today's standards. This is a masterfully crafted thriller about three crooks who manipulate a blind woman to recover lost smuggled goods. Audrey Hepburn is fantastic in the lead role, while Alan Arkin makes a terrifying villain. This superb drama filled with spell-binding tension has not lost an iota of its considerable impact, even 40 years after it was made. Audrey Hepburn is mesmerising as the blind woman whose quick thinking is more illuminating than the brightest of lights. Audrey Hepburn received her fifth (and last) Oscar nomination for effectively playing a blind woman in this well-executed thriller based on the Broadway smash hit; equally good are the villains, played by the young Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna. Director Terence Young uses darkness, shadows, sound and music to fully immerse us in the terror that Susy faces. Like Susy, surrounded by darkness, we cannot see the danger, nor can we predict what lies ahead. Wait Until Dark is that rare example of a film which is just as tense and frightening today as it when it was originally released. It might be hard to picture Alan Arkin in the role of a sadistic villain, but he's also terrific here, taking a rather cartoonish character and making him genuinely terrifying. Wait until Dark, based on Frederick Knott's legit hit, emerges as an excellent suspense drama, effective in casting, scripting, direction and genuine emotional impact. Audrey Hepburn stars as the not-so-helpless blind heroine, in a superior performance.\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\r\n\r\n\"Oh you must be so bored with me, everytime you come in here, I'm in absolute panic. \"\r\n\r\nWait Until Dark is a film I had never heard of until quite recently. After enjoying some other thrillers starring Audrey Hepburn, especially Charade, I knew I had to watch this film. And while I was skeptical of the films direction upon first glance (as it was directed by the same guy that directed three James Bond movies; Dr. No, From Russia with Love, and Thunderball, great films, but was not picturing Terence Young to direct a suspense thriller), it turns out that Wait Until Dark is not only well-made and well-acted, but it's definitely one of the most entertaining suspense thrillers ever made.\r\n\r\nMeet Susy Hendrix (Audrey Hepburn), a housewife that's still learning to cope with blindness that was the result of a recent accident. She has a loving but always away husband (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) and has a strong friendship with young neighbor Gloria (Julie Herrod). Things get complicated when criminals, led by the sadistic Roat (Alan Arkin), break into her apartment, going after a missing baby doll that she may or may not have, a doll that the crooks used to smuggle heroin into the country. Alone and with her husband away, Susy has to use her resourcefulness and her knowledge of her small apartment to get out of this situation alive.\r\n\r\nThe film also stars Richard Crenna and Jack Weston as the other crooks and Samantha Jones in a small part as Lisa, the woman who first had the doll.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure what I was going to think of Wait Until Dark when the opening credits started rolling. The beginning was a little slow and a little complicated to follow and Audrey Hepburn doesn't even appear until 25 minutes into the picture. But it turns out, the more the film progresses, the more engaging the plot is and the more suspenseful the mystery is. My other fear on this film was that the crooks were going to be these one-dimensional characters who end up raiding the house, the end, good bye. But what makes Wait Until Dark innovative is how the crooks manage to do their plotting. They don't just raid the house, no (and this is a mouthful) they take the nicest talking crook, make him like Hepburn as a friend, gain her confidence in getting him the doll, making the leader pose as two real insane nuts, and using the rough sounding guy posing as the police in order for Hepburn to just give them the doll. And all I have to say about this is... brilliant. An engaging plot like this causes Wait Until Dark to be as psychologically complex and shocking as an Alfred Hitchcock movie. \r\n\r\nEven more unique about the film is its cinematography. Rather than the average thriller where we're treated to rich, exotic locations and over-the-top action, 98% of the film is set in the apartment, giving the film more of a claustrophobic look, and it works fantastically. My favorite moment camera wise is a shot where Hepburn is upset that the crooks cut her phone line, and the shot featuring stair railings makes her look like she's locked up in some prison cell somewhere. But nothing can be more suspenseful than the 20-minute finale in the dark. I was told that the ending was one of the most frightening, psychologically insane sequences ever, and guess what? I was told well. \r\n\r\nAlso making the film work well are its acting performances. I was skeptical of Alan Arkin playing a sadistic crook, as I'm used to seeing him in goofy, comedic roles, but Arkin surprisingly nails his character. It's probably the best you'll ever see of Arkin, as this is likely the only time he played a role this complex. Another surprising performance is Julie Herrod as the girl Gloria. I thought she would be this obnoxious brat (as her opening scene would suggest), but I applaud the filmmakers for making the character feel more natural in what a child would do in tense situations. But it's Audrey Hepburn who gives the best performance as Susy the blind housewife. In something that was groundbreaking for 1967, we are treated to one, self reliant, independent, and resourceful woman. And Hepburn plays a role unlike any other character she's played, and was deserving of her Best Actress nom.\r\n\r\nIf Henry Mancini did not score Wait Until Dark, I'm not sure if the film would work in the suspense department. It's chilling, it's eerie, and the odd-sounding chords are just downright creepy! It's safe to say that this is one of Mancini's best scores, along with The Pink Panther, The Great Race, and Charade. \r\n\r\nWait Until Dark does what a great suspense thriller should do. It's highly entertaining, the performances are outstanding, the score is chilling, and the filming techniques are the most innovative I've seen in the world of suspense thrillers, creating the psychological, claustrophobic look that sums up the greatness of the film as a whole. If Charade is considered the greatest Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never made, then this would be the second best!\r\n\r\n\"No discipline... Bad news... Leads to anarchy.\"",
