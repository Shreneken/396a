Guess Who's Coming to Dinner may not really deliver a particularly revolutionary punch with its relatively conventional love story, but that was a compromise that needed to be made to draw appropriate conclusions regarding the perception of race in America; it just doesn't make it particularly radical viewing in 2020 without taking into account the film's particular historical context. With Poitier, Hepburn, and Tracy (in his final film role), the film is well-stocked with talent, which makes the exceptionally poor performance from Houghton all the more obvious, standing out like a sore thumb. Let it be known, all you have to do to make up for the apparently cardinal sin of being black is to become an enormously successful physician and humanitarian, then you meet the minimum threshold to marry a white girl.

He was like the old man from Up and the old man in Dennis the Menace's supreme overlord. Having only seen this one Hepburn movie she reminded me strongly of Jessica Lang, whose acting I am a big fan of. The screenplay and dialogue were written fantastically and for a movie without much action it had a surprising amount of rising action and suspense. Hepburn laughing at Spencer's lines felt like genuine displays of her warmth toward him and their scene at the icecream place was just perfect. The scene with the maid's daughter and boyfriend seemed incongruent with the rest of the movie and I was exasperated for much of the movie at the frequent scenes of Hepburn's eyes brimming with tears but none coming out; I grew to be impressed by it at the end as it obviously takes some serious skill to pull off (as seen by the multiple tears falling on the daughter's less talented face at the end). I would've liked for the film score to be more involved, though I can't say I can imagine there being a lot of room for more music, and I thought the heated response from Poitier to his dad near the end was a little heavyhanded, like it was written by a white guy that wasn't sure how a black father and son would speak to each other.

Not to mention, for a realistic fiction movie that takes place in the 1960's, its a tad pit unrealistic. Lastly I don't like ow the black father is portrayed in the end making it seem as though he's the only one who doesn't approve when he's the only one who really had a valid reason for not approving their marriage. The white father reasons were strictly do to race and nothing more.",

            "content": "Race relations dramas starring Sidney Poitier from the 1950s and 1960s generally haven't aged well with Lilies of the Field (1963), The Defiant Ones (1958) and this film in particular seeming patronizing and dated by today's standards. This film has the added weight of featuring Spencer Tracy in his last film role alongside longtime professional and personal partner Katharine Hepburn who would win an undeserved Academy Award for her performance. I would recommend that you watch the five to ten minutes of this film that are just Tracy and Hepburn interacting but failing that I would say go out and watch The Graduate (1967) before stepping near this very much a product of it's time film.\n\nTwenty three year old white girl Joanna Drayton, Katharine Houghton, falls in love with older widowed doctor John Prentice, Sidney Poitier, who happens to be African-American. The two face many obstacles in getting married when they return to the United States as Prentice is determined to earn the approval of Drayton's parents, Matt, Spencer Tracy, and Christina, Katharine Hepburn, who each react differently to the news of their daughter's new romance. Matt is worried about the two of them getting married because they have only known each other for two weeks but Christina is trying her best to win him over. More drama is added to the mix when Prentice's parents are invited to dinner with the family and their own prejudices are revealed.\n\nThe first comment that I must make is that this a poorly made film from a technical standpoint. The sound cuts out at odd times, certain scenes run far too long and often end awkwardly on lines that don't wrap up conversations adequately. I expected at least a basic level of competence from a film that is so famous but this film didn't deliver as it seemed to rely on it's star wattage and the good will that it's intentions brought to the reception of the film to coast by. The film set also looks cheap as I never believed that the exterior of their house or their ‘view' was even remotely realistic and when considering the fact that this was made in 1967 I'm not as willing to cut it slack as I would be had it been made in the 1950s. This general shoddiness impacted how I viewed the film because it often distracted from the message the film was trying to send and the occasionally effecting performances.\n\nAnother big issue with the film is that it's one of those disgusting pictures that exploits a social issue by presenting two supposedly normal characters who eventually adopt a progressive view that is already held by the majority of the audience. In this way the film preaches to the converted, it is saying something that might have been genuinely controversial or refreshing a few generations beforehand but which was held by the majority of Hollywood in 1967. It's frustrating watch a film be so pleased with itself when what it does really isn't all that special or brave. Adding to my dislike of the way the film chooses to present it's social issue they attempt to equalize whites and blacks by portraying the African-American characters as being equally as prejudiced as Matt and Christina. They never really flesh out this plotline and it feels like a strange deflection from the fact that the majority of racism between white Americans and African-Americans comes from the white Americans.\n\nThere is also something lacking in the performances as Hepburn and Tracy are occasionally a delight to watch but are used too sparingly to save such a weak film and Houghton and Poitier fail to inject any real spirit into their performances. Houghton seems unable to deliver her lines convincingly as she flits about and uses as many hand gestures as her famous aunt does but doesn't possess the dramatic heft or the knowing humor to pull of this act. She and Poitier also fail to generate any chemistry which makes it difficult for us to feel any real dramatic tension because we don't really care if they end up together. The amount of Academy Award nominations this film received was a crime and it is quite obvious that Anne Bancroft deserved the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance in The Graduate (1967).\n\nThe best scenes in the film will only leave you reminiscing about the classic romantic comedies that Hepburn and Tracy appeared in together and in that case I would tell you to see Desk Set (1957) and Adam's Rib (1949) before going near this dud.",

            "content": "It would be completely understandable if anyone criticized this movie for playing it very safe after taking some severe risks at the beginning, and that in doing so the story not only became progressively formulaic; but the characters appeared to be stereotyped and, worst of all, self-contradictory and inconsistent.\n\nThat said, the acting here is undoubtedly more than enough to overcome these issues and redeem them, nay, to totally justify these seemingly nonsensical changes and alterations that happened to some of the characters, most noticeably Matt and Christina Drayton. I have seen a lot of great performances that are able to elevate the characters and even the entire movie in general. But, frankly, I have never seen any performance, no matter how superb it may be, that can convince me of what I considered an unmistakably major flaw. What makes me appreciate the acting, in particular, in this movie is that it opened my eyes to some hidden underlying themes of the movie's story, which are more than fundamental to understand the movie properly. If the fabulously realistic and sincere performances, somehow, didn't do the same for you, I suggest you try you figure out some key themes to consider them as you're watching the movie. Two of the most important themes are; the late resurgence of the inherited awful traditions and beliefs, and the undiscovered hypocrisy. Yes, that's how profound this apparently simple film actually is! Of course, the shift in Matt Drayton's attitude could have been executed way more smoothly and maturely; but the abrupt nature of the changes could be fairly, if not quite easily, taken as a reflection of the character's disorder.\n\nSpencer Tracy, in his final role, gave, for lack of a better word, a mature performance that made his character surprisingly believable despite its outwardly incompatible attitudes that made the character of Matt Drayton seem to be immensely problematic. Sidney Poitier's performance, as the handsome African-American Dr. John Prentice, is solid, steady, committed, engaging and relatable at the same time. Katharine Houghton captured the rebelliousness, impetuousness, and also the innocence of her character, Joey, so perfectly. She reminded me quite a bit of another Katharine; Katharine Ross as Elaine Robinson in The Graduate, which was, also coincidentally, released at the same year, 1967. But it's Katharine Hepburn who stole the show here with her Oscar-winning performance that I personally consider as one of the best low-key performances in a leading female role I've ever seen in film!\n\nI would be lying if I said that I found the second half of the movie half as entertaining and riveting. Nevertheless, the dialogue was much better at the second half (the final monologue is simply remarkable!) as it was at the first, which is noticeably elevated by, once again, the incredible acting.\n\nThe movie is decidedly filled with stereotypical characters, but the only one that bothered me is the maid, Tillie, whom I didn't find to be funny at all; actually she is quite annoying. Her character's motivations and attitudes are justified, though.\n\nGuess Whoâ(TM)s Coming to Dinner is an essential classic 1960s film, and one of the best films that examine prejudice and racism; it tackles its weighty themes with surprising depth, humor and breeziness. It's also very relevant nowadays. And there is no doubt that it has major influences on hundreds of movies that came after it, especially today's.\n\n(8.5/10)",

Pride of race is unnecessary and often leads to a sense of superiority over other races, or a need to ascribe to victimhood.

Not only does the movie manage to be interesting, it is delightful for the entire runtime. There are so many moments that will stick with me because they made me laugh, cry, or cheer. The movie includes people who are on every side when it comes to views on interracial relationships, so it feels like it should speak to all audiences (except the Hilary St. George’s of the world who can shut up and go away.) There is so much heart to this movie, because the characters clearly love one another dearly. Fathers and mothers love their children despite everything, husbands and wives love one another more than they can say, and even friends are loved like family. I felt like this entire movie embraced me like a warm hug, despite the hot-button issue that is at the center of it all. One big reason Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner is so successful is that amazing cast. Sidney Poitier has immeasurable charm and uses it to make the point that he’s just a man and he shouldn’t be defined by his color. He makes for a nice grounded counterpoint to Katharine Houghton’s bubbly lightness. Katharine Hepburn is astounding, and says so many things with just her eyes. You can see her opinions change as the film progresses without her needing to say how she’s feeling. Spencer Tracy is left with one of the toughest roles of the whole movie. It is remarkable how he is able to be the main character who is opposed to the wedding, sounding like a complete hypocrite, and yet still be sympathetic. Roy Glenn and Beah Richards don’t get as much screen-time, but their impact is vital to the film as well, and they both get important scenes when they arrive. Not to mention Cecil Kellaway who had one of my favorite moments in the entire film. I know there will be audiences who will not gravitate to this style of movie. Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner establishes its premise early and then spends the rest of the time with characters just talking it through. It feels like a stage play because so much of the film takes place in one house, and there is not much action aside from walking around. The closest they come to a stunt was a fender-bender between two cars at an ice cream parlor. However, when the dialogue is written this well, I don’t care one bit. I was riveted as much as I am watching Die Hard. I can’t say enough about the big speeches in this movie. Almost every character in the film gets their moment to let loose with a monologue at some point. They are written so well that they help define the character who is giving the speech, and also articulate an important point related to the central conflict of the film. I don’t know how much more I can say about Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner. It blew me away, and I now need to own it so I can watch it 10 more times at least.",

Another film that stood test of time because it tackles the same problems we face today. When are we going to subdue racism and stop judging people, we will never know. One thing for sure, we are in a better position than we were 50 and so years ago.",

Insurance didn't want to cover this film (rumors of Tracy's health) so both Hepburn & Kramer put up their own salaries as collateral.

Of course it was also interesting to see two Katherines on screen - with identical hair no less! Mother & daughter parts in the script were actually cast with an Aunt & Niece in real life!\n\nPoitier's gives another stellar performance to rival his Oscar winning performance in \"In the Heat of the Night\", which was the same year. Alternating between the well-mannered, educated, modern man and the sheepish, procrastinating son-of-a-mailman comes off seamlessly within his character.\n\nOf course having Isabel Sanford among the cast was also genius. As for the story-telling, this is about social NIMBYism. Can families stay together when they must prove that their personal code of conduct is identical to idealized goals. Can a person who has tragically lost a family fall deeply in love again, and will that love be as solid as the life-long love of elderly parents that cherish a lifetime of memories?\n\nThis film is still a pressure-cooker analogy of modern society.",

            "content": "Representing the swan song of Spencer Tracy and solidifying Sidney Poitier's resume, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner is an examination of the changes going on during the mid to late 1960's. The film has a very basic premise in which young Joey (Katherine Houghton) comes home from a trip to Hawaii with John Prentice (Poitier) to meet her parents (Tracy and Katherine Hepburn). What follows is the conflicted feelings that go along with the changing times of the 1960's. John will not marry Joey without the consent of her parents. Her parents are unsure about giving consent, not due to their own racism, but due to the fear of how difficult their life will be as an interracial couple. Added in are the two cents of everyone around the family. True, this can be a comedy at times, but it's more a look at the old guard facing the new guard.\n\nDirected by the legendary Stanley Kramer, the film represents a kind of social experiment. Let's drop '60's progressivism on the nuclear family of the 1950's (although the privileged life of the Drayton's is far from nuclear). The Drayton's are not conservative minded individuals, but very left leaning. Still, they fear for their daughter and how that current state of the world would react to them. Tracy delivers his final performance with a flourish and considering his death was imminent brings even greater power to his role. Add to the fact that this is one final pairing with Katherine Hepburn makes it even more bitter sweet. Hepburn also mesmerizes on the screen as the mother giddy over her daughter's upcoming nuptials, yet fearful at the same time. Once again Poitier proves that he is one of the greatest actors of this era, a witty and likeable presence that thinks things out for the protection of others. The only real negative of the film is Houghton's performance as Joey, which comes across as very snotty and annoying. Whether it was written this way or not, you can almost feel like maybe John would be better of with not being tied to her in some instances.\n\nI asked myself a question while watching this film. Have we moved forward in the last half century compared to our ideals? In some ways we have. Interracial marriage is not illegal in seven states, as the film reminds us. There's very little stigma related to it anymore, other than the old school and uneducated. The thing is that it feels like where we have progressed as a society, we're still slipping in other areas. To avoid making this review an ideology discussion I'll stop there. Guess Who's Coming To Dinner is a time capsule of the '60's and represents one of the greatest psychological battles of all time. When your ideals come home how are you going to react?",

            "content": "The film Certainly had its impact at the time of its release, 45 years later, it is still compulsively watchable and if one swap the interracial couple with a gay couple everything would work effortlessly and even no big change of the dialogues is necessary.\n\nThe ensemble is the quintessence of the film's success, personally I adore Poitier's well-educated mien and his eloquent rebutting of his father's parochial opinion of offspring's duty to conduct what parents think is right, evade from social prejudice and merely follow the leader. But in lieu of the plot, John (Poitier) and his white-skin trophy wife-to-be Joey (Houghton) have to recede to a morally-low position, William Rose's script has proffered all the possible (and impossible) approaches to dramatise the situation (a 15 years age difference) and pressure the judgment call should be resolved within the meagre time span (half day at most).  \n\nThus, the entire climax is the father of the bride Matt's (Spencer Tracy) decision (it seems a bit racist their black counterpart has little saying in this condition), the professed liberal white man's crucial decision is the game changer seeing that his wife Christina (Hepburn) has capitulated long ago and \"completely sympathetic\", has firmly chosen her side of her mollycoddled daughter. So Matt's ultimate 8-minutes soliloquy (prefaced by a self-affirmation \"I will be a son of b****\") not only has its power of wisdom and appeal to be an excellent showpiece of ethical preaching, a cordial and visceral performance merits standing ovation, but also in the nonfictional life, Tracy's ailing health and his fervid love for Hepburn (out of marriage) are tangible and heart-wrenching, in the coda of his swan song, it reaches a pinnacle by his declaration of love and it is an impeccable curtain call both on and off screen (Tracy died weeks after the filming). \n\nHowever, it is Hepburn, won her third Oscar together with Rose's Best Adapted Screenplay win (out of its overall 10 nominations) while Tracy's posthumous recognition come unstuck. With a borderline leading role among a peerless cast, Hepburn's win might be an overrated adulation, nonetheless it is no slander could smear the performance itself, it is her competency is shortchanged. Houghton, the real niece of Hepburn and a debutante in the film business, tackles with an unsympathetic role out of her naivety, she is reckless and selfish enough to put her parents into such a difficult situation, but it is what the storyline requires, so what left for her to subjectively interpret is very limited. \n\nSupporting players are also commendable, Kellaway and Richards are nominated as well (the stereotyped good persons with high moral conscience, admirable and amiable), but Sanford's biased black maid's opinion behooves much more introspection towards the innate frailty of human race, love guides us and love blinds us too.\n\nThis almost one-apartment cramped family drama even now has its pertinent social reference, which is a sad truth to accept, just wish Tracy and Hepburn will not be disappointed up there in Elysium.",

I like the fact that the film revolves on the racial issue, a bold move considering it was made in the era where prejudice against african-american still prevailed. Title sounds comedic, but I'd consider it more of a drama. Humour is still there, mostly found in dialogues between Hepburn-Tracy duo.

The true star of this movie is however not Hepburn, but is in fact Sidney Poitier who plays Dr. John Prentice, a renowned medical physician and effortlessly well-mannered black fellow who falls in love with not just any girl - but a white and privileged one - whom transfixes on the idea of introducing the pair to her affluent parents as a 'madly in love' couple. However, this is to the dismay of the girl's father, portrayed by Spencer Tracy in his Oscar-nominated and final film role and initially her mother Christina whom stress that they won't have a \"dog's chance\" of curbing prejudice and blinded bigotry. Katharine Houghton - real life niece of Hepburn - marks her first feature-length picture as the eccentric and quirky Joey. \r\n\r\nI understand that there is severe criticism for this picture by not only representing the harsh white superiority values of the time but the significantly low position women held during 1960s America. Almost every leading female character in the picture is suppressed by men and deemed either irrational or foolish. But I believe this serves as an ideal way of interpreting the society of America in 1967 and not only the shameful mistreatment of African-Americans at the time but of women also - regardless of color. The disproval of Hepburn being awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress is also something of controversy surrounding this picture. Although Hepburn's character was stunningly portrayed, the role of her partner, was of more deserving higher critical appraise. \r\n\r\nThis film is not just a part of cinematic history, but world history. Historically, during the filming and release of this picture, 17 US states outlawed interracial marriage and it was only until June 1967 - two days after Tracy's death - that this was repealed. Tracy's ill health was prominent during the later sections of the film; in particular, the bathroom scene before the \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" punch line takes full effect to a very deeply saddened a teary Hepburn.",

It's a beautifully made and very compelling film that didn't let me go until it was over. I was captivated from beginning to end since the story is phenomenal, the acting is superb, I loved the humor, it's heartwarming, it's emotional, and it also gets its messages across beautifully.

Obviously, her parents played by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, are startled by this whirlwind event. They are even more dismayed when they discover he is a black man. Hepburn's character lightens to the idea while her husband is adamantly against it. Soon everything becomes even more complicated when the man's parents are invited to dinner, only to be equally startled. Eventually giving it more thought, Tracy does condone the marriage realizing how much his daughter is in love. This would be Tracy's final film and he would die only a couple weeks after shooting ended. He and Hepburn do a wonderful job with Sidney Poitier and Katharine Hougton as well.

For instance, there was one scene where John was saying to Matt that their child could become the Secretary of State, if not the President. Now the rest was history. The President of the United States was a biracial kid who would be exactly like their kids but was already 6 years old at the time when the film was made! Also, although race is the central issue in the movie, I find it interesting to look at the gender dynamics as well. In fact, the idea in the film that I entertain most is that men tend to create problems, and women tend to solve them. Think about that.",

They must confront the prejudices that they didn't believe they had.\r\n\r\nThe film is dated, for sure.  The idea of a white woman and black man dating is not at all daring today.

But this is merely a one-sided view at the whole picture. True, it does have its fallacies - a love story where the plot deviates to a Stoic discussion on masculinity and the duties of a father (in the aforementioned scene). However, right from the start, Kramer has cleverly mixed comedy and drama into one superb potion, and that potion is of course the film.\n\nIt has a genuine love song (\"The Glory of Love\"), though not an original; Oscar-worthy performances not only by Hepburn and Tracy (in his last role), but also by the leads Houghton and Poitier; and last but not least, a genuinely moving monologue delivered by Tracy's character (the last in his entire career), that puts to shame all the other so-called \"heart-piercing\" monologues in other sentimental films. What this film does not have in excess is sentimentality, and that, as experience should prove, is something that should be so in a tale like this. A liberal drama clashing against the ways of the times, and a love story that should be watched by those into the genre. With one major weakness - everything, including Prentice's record, is a clean bill. Everything seems too perfect. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars.",

            "content": "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner takes place during the course of one day as two families struggle to overcome their concerns about the interracial marriage of their children. This film is a treat for the eyes with lovely sets and beautiful people. It also has a nice 1960's feel that is reinforced by sophisticated wardrobing and an \"easy listening\" soundtrack--featuring The Glory of Love as the signature tune. The film relies very heavily on the use of dialog and reflects the elegance of a time when people were entertained by stimulating conversation. The San Francisco backdrop also is the perfect setting for a movie that challenged racial convention.\n\nBut there are a few serious flaws. This is an introductory role for Katharine Houghton (Hepburn's niece) who plays Sidney Portier's fiancÃ (C)--Johanna Drayton. Her inexperience is apparent, particularly in comparison to heavyweights Portier, Tracy and Hepburn and as a result, she is unconvincing in the part. Moreover, her character is not well-written or well-developed which makes it difficult to understand why Sidney Portier's character--John Prentice-would fall in love with a woman who appears to have so little to offer intellectually --given his significant professional achievements as a doctor. One also must ask why it was necessary for his character to be cast as a doctor in order to be seen as an acceptable partner for a young white woman who had not really accomplished anything accept being born into a privileged family. The answer is simple. Making Prentice a doctor-and not just any doctor-but a world renowned expert in tropical medicine, made the interracial relationship more acceptable to white audiences during the 1960s.\n\nThe other cast members are outstanding and the on-screen chemistry phenomenal. Katharine Hepburn (Christina Drayton) and Spencer Tracy (Newspaper Publisher Matt Drayton) deliver brilliant performances as Johanna's parents. John Prentice's modest working class parents are played with great dignity by Beah Richards and Roy E. Glen. Mrs. Prentice and Mrs. Drayton favor the marriage and both characters provide passionate, articulate arguments as to why their husbands should agree. But their husbands voice serious objections and the families spend the evening in intense discussions over the issue, accurately reflecting the racial fears that existed 40 years ago. Prentice's father reminds him that in many states interracial marriage is illegal and that he is \"getting out of line.\" There are also a number of very memorable and funny lines. In the scene in which Matt Drayton wonders why \"the colored kids dance better than the white kids\", Portier's response is classic--\"you dance the Watusi, but we are the Watusi!\"(For readers under 40, the Watusi was a popular dance in the 1960s and also an African tribe). Cecil Kelloway, who plays friend of the family, Monsignor Ryan, deftly brings a sense of humor and moral guidance that is effective because it is not \"preachy\". He challenges Matt Drayton's liberal credentials and suggests that Drayton's misgivings about his daughter marrying a black man reveal his hypocrisy. Isabel Sanford (\"Weezy from The Jeffersons TV program) plays the feisty maid of the Draytons.\n\nIt's been said that in the final scene Tracy--who was very ill at the time and who died shortly after the movie was completed--delivered one of the longest soliloquies in American film history, in only one take. Katherine Helpurn was clearly so moved by the scene that it's hard to believe that she is just acting as her eyes brim with tears.\n\nAlthough the some of the sentiments are dated, this film is highly entertaining, and provides a rare opportunity to experience outstanding performances from six gifted actors who bring compassion and depth to Stanley Kramer's film. Its' angst relative to interracial marriage also reminds us of how far we have not come.",

For what's it's worth, I'll just say right off the bat that no matter what, this was, is, and always will be a film worthy of serious thought and discussion, and that's one of the biggest compliments I can give to it or any movie. \n\nThe story is one about interracial love. Dr. John Prentice is a successful, kind, and sensitive African American who, depsite only knowing her for 10 days, has fallen in love with a nice young white girl girl named Joey Drayton. His parents are working class, or at least were. Her parents are wealthy upper class old line liberals. The plot of the movie concerns John and Joey going to see her parents to tell them of their intentions to marry as soon as they can due to his demanding schedule, and of course, their approval. \n\nThe movie examines various perspectives concerning the issue of interracial marriage, whichwhen the film was being made was illegal in 17 states. Within several months that was no longer the case, but the time period was still rife with tensions as the country was dealing with Civil Rights and Vietnam. The film is dated to an extent, even though in some places the central issue of the film is actually still cause for some concern. Modern audiences however, would proably have more of an issue with the fact that John and Joey have only known each other for 10 days though.\n\nThe film is to be commended for at least treating the subject seriously and in a dramatic manner, though there is some humor here and there to keep the film from being too heavy and pretentious. The writing does have some faults, such as John being presented as pretty much flawless and maybe a tad Uncle Tomish (maybe to make the film more comfortable for white audiences), and their love is shown as pure and chaste, but it does touch upon black on black racism, even if the film really comes off as more about white guilt, oh, and the ending. \n\nThe film does play it safe at times, but that's mostly the hindsight talking. I understand that this was a risky film when it came out, and I'm thankful it was made to begin with. Where this film shines and is at its best is with the acting. This is the strongest part of the film. There's an overflow of monologues here, but the dialogues are engaging and well done. Poitier is really good as Prentice though, as I mentioned, his character is maybe too perfect. Katherine Houghton is really good as Joey, I loved Isabel Sanford as the Drayton's black maid who really sticks it to John. Everyone usually makes the boiggest deal though about Hepburn and Tracy. This was their final film together, and his final film period (he died 17 days after filming wrapped). During his final monologue, the tears in Hepburn's eyes were real as both she and him knew that because of his poor health, this would be the last work he'd ever do. The final scene is powerful and moving enough as is, but this knowledge makes it even more so. \n\nThis is an entertaining film, and it tries to do something and say something, but I really had a hard time with it, mostly because I was watching it (and am reviewing it) with two different mindsets (scholar studying black history and regular film fan) running simultaneously, thus my opinion about it is mixed, though I'm trying to find a middle ground. \n\nFor those reasons, and the reasons I've lsited throughout this review, I gotta be fair and gve this one a straight B. I do encourage you to see it, but I do think that it could have been better, no matter how risky it was back then. Like I said, at least it got made in the first place.",

This time the subject was the ticklish one of inter-racial marriage ( it was in the 1960's when interracial marriages in a few states in the USA were illegal.)\r\n\r\nIn 1967's San Francisco, after the Civil Rights Act has been signed but before Martin Luther King has been assassinated, young Joanna Drayton (Katharine Houghton) arrives back at her parents' upscale home after being away for a while.  She wanted to marry a black , and albeit  the daughter of ultra-liberal parents, their principles put to a severe test. Her parents, the prominent liberal newspaper owner Matt Drayton (Spencer Tracy) and his elegant wife Christina (Katharine Hepburn) are delighted to see her but are suddenly taken aback when she reveals that she's had a new boyfriend for 10 days, he's 14 years older, she's in love, she's going to marry him, and she needs their blessing tonight. Oh, and he's 'colored.' As Joanna blithely explains, 'It never occurred to me that I would fall in love with a Negro, but I have, and nothing's going to change that.'\r\n\r\nOf course, Sidney Poitier is an ideal choice: An internationally respected specialist in his field (medicine), impeccably mannered, handsome, well-dressed, and a descendant of a respectable California family. What more could a mother want for her child? Of course, our daughters could marry nice black doctors like Poitier.\r\n\r\nForty four years old now, the issues it dared to raise at a time when they were extremely controversial still echo across the decades. It's dated a bit, but to watch it today is to measure how far we've come.\r\n\r\nSubject matter aside, the film surely owed much of its popularity to the appearance in it of Hepburn and Tracy as the mum and dad of the girl. It's the ninth time Tracy had acted in this picture with Hepburn and they both played together as beautifully as always.\r\n\r\n \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,\" probably remembered today as more of a Sidney Poitier film than anyone else's.

It is like \"Gentleman's Agreement\" from 1947, which also deals with racism against Jews, only more boring. In addition, within the last month, this is third film that I have seen which not deserve Best Actress, specifically for Katherine Hepburn. I guess Best Actress recipient are usually not chosen or were for a period of time. As well, Sidney Poitier was in another film that was focused on racism from the same year called \"In the Heat of the Night\" which is much better and the Best Picture winner of 1967.

Sidney Poitier gives a solid, though maybe a bit too aloof, performance.  Katharine Hepburn is good but Spencer Tracy seems too formulaic in his actions.

You say you don't want to tell me how to live my life. So what do you think you've been doing? You tell me what rights I've got or haven't got, and what I owe to you for what you've done for me. Let me tell you something. I owe you nothing! If you carried that bag a million miles, you did what you're supposed to do! Because you brought me into this world. And from that day you owed me everything you could ever do for me like I will owe my son if I ever have another. But you don't own me! You can't tell me when or where I'm out of line, or try to get me to live my life according to your rules. You don't even know what I am, Dad, you don't know who I am. You don't know how I feel, what I think. And if I tried to explain it the rest of your life you will never understand. You are 30 years older than I am. You and your whole lousy generation believes the way it was for you is the way it's got to be. And not until your whole generation has lain down and died will the dead weight of you be off our backs! You understand, you've got to get off my back! Dad... Dad, you're my father. I'm your son. I love you. I always have and I always will. But you think of yourself as a colored man. I think of myself as a man. Now, I've got a decision to make, hm? And I've got to make it alone, and I gotta make it in a hurry. So would you go out there and see after my mother? \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTillie: I don't care to see a member of my own race getting above himself. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMatt Drayton: When I had ice cream before, I had a special kind of flavor that I liked very much but I can't remember what it was. \r\nCarhop: I'll bring you the list, sir. \r\nMatt Drayton: Oh no.

I want you to go straight back to the gallery - Start your motor - When you get to the gallery tell Jennifer that she will be looking after things temporarily, she's to give me a ring if there's anything she can't deal with herself. Then go into the office, and make out a check, for \"cash,\" for the sum of $5,000. Then carefully, but carefully Hilary, remove absolutely everything that might subsequently remind me that you had ever been there, including that yellow thing with the blue bulbs which you have such an affection for. Then take the check, for $5,000, which I feel you deserve, and get - permanently - lost. It's not that I don't want to know you, Hilary - although I don't - it's just that I'm afraid we're not really the sort of people that you can afford to be associated with. \r\n[Hilary opens her mouth to say something] \r\nChristina Drayton: Don't speak, Hilary, just... go. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[last lines] \r\nMatt Drayton: Now Mr. Prentice, clearly a most reasonable man, says he has no wish to offend me but wants to know if I'm some kind of a *nut*. And Mrs. Prentice says that like her husband I'm a burned-out old shell of a man who cannot even remember what it's like to love a woman the way her son loves my daughter. And strange as it seems, that's the first statement made to me all day with which I am prepared to take issue... cause I think you're wrong, you're as wrong as you can be. I admit that I hadn't considered it, hadn't even thought about it, but I know exactly how he feels about her and there is nothing, absolutely nothing that you son feels for my daughter that I didn't feel for Christina. Old- yes. Burned-out- certainly, but I can tell you the memories are still there- clear, intact, indestructible, and they'll be there if I live to be 110. Where John made his mistake I think was in attaching so much importance to what her mother and I might think... because in the final analysis it doesn't matter a damn what we think. The only thing that matters is what they feel, and how much they feel, for each other. And if it's half of what we felt- that's everything. As for you two and the problems you're going to have, they seem almost unimaginable, but you'll have no problem with me, and I think when Christina and I and your mother have some time to work on him you'll have no problem with your father, John. But you do know, I'm sure you know, what you're up against. There'll be 100 million people right here in this country who will be shocked and offended and appalled and the two of you will just have to ride that out, maybe every day for the rest of your lives. You could try to ignore those people, or you could feel sorry for them and for their prejudice and their bigotry and their blind hatred and stupid fears, but where necessary you'll just have to cling tight to each other and say \"screw all those people\"! Anybody could make a case, a hell of a good case, against your getting married. The arguments are so obvious that nobody has to make them. But you're two wonderful people who happened to fall in love and happened to have a pigmentation problem, and I think that now, no matter what kind of a case some bastard could make against your getting married, there would be only one thing worse, and that would be if - knowing what you two are and knowing what you two have and knowing what you two feel- you didn't get married. Well, Tillie, when the hell are we gonna get some dinner?",

Sure, had I seen it as a child in the 80s, it probably would have had more of an impact even then. However, I see interracial couples every day and I barely even notice.\n\nHaving said that, you have to respect this movie regardless. Creating a movie like this, with this sort of subject matter, was bold and went against everything that was acceptable at the time ... I have to admire that.\n\nAs far as the movie itself goes, Hepburn, Tracy (in his final role before passing away), and Poitier were all excellent and supported by a stellar script. A movie so dialog driven can only be pulled off with exceptional acting and this aspect carries the movie.\n\nHaving said that, Katherine Houghton's character grated on me and actually took away from the movie. Headstrong and naive, she seemed to make stupid comment after another and made most of the awkward situation worse than it already was.\n\nLastly, after building up this dramatic and powerful scenario, Stanley Kramer sort of cops out in the end. \n\nAnyway, it wasn't an instant classic to me, but as I stated earlier ... that may be because I am from an entirely different era.

It's uneven in terms of its execution; the ideas are admirable, but they are indicative of the nascent steps in white guilt's efforts to right wrongs.  Making Sidney Poitier the king of all oreos was one way to accomplish this; by making his character unassailable in any way, the parents are forced to wrestle with their inner misgivings and portrayed as the obstacle (in a funny twist, the black parents are upset at this marriage too).  This movie is obviously not as cutting-edge as it was when it came out, but the production values are strong, acting is notable and the script is well-written, if a little preachy.  There's much more to like than dislike; the film is charming (as is Katharine Hepburn and that lovable priest) that we can overlook the film's obviously constructed feel.

The movie is an interesting and entertaining critic on that subject, but it is as well a heartfelt story with protagonists we can care about.\r\n\r\nKatherine Houghton and Sidney Poitier star as Joanna Drayton and Dr. John Prentice, a white female and a color man who met in Hawai during one of John's university conferences. Despite it was frowned upon at the time, the two fall in love and start a relationship, which, in ten days, develop into a marriage commitment. John feels that Joanna's parents won't accept him, but she assures him they will, therefore they decide to travel to their home so they can meet John. But when they arrive her parents, mostly her dad (played by Spencer Tracy), are against their marriage, though her mother (played by Katahrine Hepburn) later accepts them. But to complicate things, Joanna invites John's parents to dinner. The same case applies here: his mother (Beah Richards) accepts their marriage, but his father (Roy E. Glenn) refuses to give them their approval, even in a harsher way than Joanna's father did. \r\n\r\nIn the world of 2010 we are used to interracial marriages, but in the world of 1967 it was a very but very rare thing to happen, and I think that that is one of the things that makes this film work, the impact it had at the time. Even today I can see the controversy this theme caused, and it is clearly reflected in the character's of this film. It is an interesting subject to aboard, and I think that the makers of this film did it right.\r\n\r\nThe film received one nomination for each of the acting categories, and won for Best Actress for Katharine Hepburn. I think that the nominations are a clear sign that the performances in this film were outstanding, but I do think that maybe a couple of more players deserved to be mentioned: I am speaking of Sidney Poitier, who plays John, and Roy E. Glenn, who plays his father. Both of this actors played magnificently their roles, with the proper sentimental value they had to give to their characters. There is a dialogue between the two that I think it must be the most powerful scene in this film, and it was quite moving. For the other actors most of them played their roles wonderfully too. The only winner, Katharine Hepburn played her character with skills and she certainly shows her emotions, but I still think that the winner that year should have been Anne Bancroft from The Graduate. Spencer Tracy did a terrific job too, getting into his character. I think you can see he is believing all he is saying. Cecil Kellaway (who playes Monsignor Ryan, a friend of the family) and Beah Richards (who played John's mother), were nominated for the supporting roles, and I think they deserve their nominations. But there was one player I couldn't really stand and that was Katherine Houghton. Is not that she was utterly bad, but she was mediocre at best, and some of the dialogues she said sounded too forced and sometimes out of place, but not because of the screenplay but because of her (and I hope I am not being too harsh) making them sound annoying. She is like the central character, along with Sidney Poitier, but there were moments I couldn't stand her.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to be praised in this film is the screenplay, which won at the Oscars. The screenplay is very well written. The characters are nicely done so we can care about, but I think I would have appreciated some more look into the character's past. The situations in this film rank from funny to moving, and many were inspiring and powerful. The dialogues were smartly written, with some sounding out smart, others funny and others charming, and there were a couple which were memorable. Some of my favorites were \"You see yourself as a color man... but I see myself... as a man\" and \"Joey, this might be the last time I have to tell you to do something, and I am doing it: shut up.\" The first one sounds quite inspiring and has alot to do with the film's main themes, and the second one has a charming and funny effect at the same time. \r\n\r\nBut I do have a couple of complains with this film. I already mentioned a couple, as Katherine Houghton and the lack of (or the little of sounds better) character's backgroung. But there are some that I should say. First I think that the themes of racism were taken too lightly, at least until the arrival of John's parents. Until then, I felt that this subject could have been approached in a way that could have had a higher impact, and that maybe this was a key thing for a film that racism is the main item. And then there is another thing. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I felt that the film was missing something. I don't know what it was, but it felt like a couple of issues had been left on the cutting room. But that aside, it is a greatly entertaining movie.\r\n\r\nGuess Who's Coming to Dinner is a very enjoyable movie, with some great performances, smart writing, memorable quotes, moving moments and serious themes. It may have a couple of flaws, but in the end the film is very good. \r\nMy recommendation: this is a film you'll most likely enjoy, even if it is not perfect.\r\nMy score: 83%.",
