    "summary": "Paratrooper commander Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), a former French Resistance fighter during World War II, is sent to 1950s Algeria to reinforce efforts to squelch the uprisings of the Algerian War. There he faces Ali la Pointe (Brahim Haggiag), a former petty criminal who, as the leader of the Algerian Front de Liberation Nationale, directs terror strategies against the colonial French government occupation. As each side resorts to ever-increasing brutality, no violent act is too unthinkable.",

            "content": "Going into my initial viewing of \"The Battle of Algiers\", I knew I was about to witness not just an important piece of world cinema but I did not expect to find such depth and timeless appeal that assaulted me all at once!  The Director, Gillo Pontecorvo, is thought of as one of Italy's most acclaimed Directors and this is his masterpiece!  Like his early films, \"The Battle of Algiers\" utilizes a documentary feel and realism but is edited together so wonderfully, that it flows off the screen and bombards the viewer with It's wealth.  The film examines the film's title but has a multitude of perseved angles and intentions in what it portrays and to whom.  While many, including the U.S. have had subsequent viewings as not just a cautionary tale but one of combating guerilla warfare, to me I saw a brutal fight for freedom and independence above all else!  The Algerian's, who played all but the two French officers in the film, were having to go to more and more extreme acts as the French did in order to crush the revolt.  We start at the end, then proceed to the genesis of the protagonist and his rough and meaningless upbringing to fighting as a leader of his own people in a battle for the countries freedom and that of it's people.  The film is a gut wrenching and morally haunting film on both sides and is wonderfully balanced and portrayed, representing the horrors but also the humanity at the heart of people.  I acknowledge this as truly moving and essential cinema that is utterly captivating and will leave you dwelling on what you viewed and all the ground it covered along the way.",

            "content": "While \"The Battle of Algiers\" is not a film that I will feel compelled to return to very frequently, its impact is undeniable: we feel as though we have witnessed a first-hand document of the grim realities of terrorist warfare and colonial subjugation which attests, perhaps more directly than any other war film, to the inescapable reality that such drawn out, imperialistic conquests will eventually be settled in no other place than the domain of popular opinion. The film shows us with uncompromising candidness that atrocities which accompany such misguided conflicts may appear to be leading in a decisive direction, but will end up amounting to nothing more than extremely wasteful, collateral damage. Perhaps the film's greatness derives from its hyper-realistic documentary approach combined with its inescapable thematic relevance: we realize that a number of corollaries can be found in the international historical record which reinforce the feeling that Algeria's relentless resistance to colonization could serve as a stand-in for any number of previous and future conflicts. If such a film could be widely seen and understood by every key member of the world's military powers, would wars of conquest still take place? Unfortunately, they probably would, however the clarity of \"The Battle of Algiers\" should shake the faith of any thinking person considering the merits of any form of manifest destiny.",

Those seeking out a war film that features a defined plot with clearly drawn characters will no doubt be disappointed by this movie.  This is a gritty film that puts the audience in the middle of the action as the downtrodden citizens fight to regain what they have lost, namely autonomy and freedom.",

What I noticed this time, that I didn't remember: somehow I remembered the movie as the story of the FLN's eventual victory, in spite of adversity. What I didn't remember so clearly was the intensely interpersonal violence, on both sides ... along with the dense and sometimes hazy visuals of narrow Casbah neighborhoods, a feeling of solidarity with the liberation fighters goes is accompanied by something queasy. There was a lot going on here in terms of gender, which didn't necessarily jump out to me the first time, as well as the role of Islam and social issues.",

The conflict itself has a lot of moving parts, and it is a movie I could probably benefit from watching again, even though it is not a rewatch I would seek out often since the subject matter is pretty bleak.

It is filmed very skillfully in the neorealist style, using a cast of almost entirely non-actors, and made to resemble newsreel footage of its day. It is a masterpiece!\n     Though the filmmaker's sympathies clearly lie with the Algerian rebels (Font de Liberation National), the tragic, violent events on both sides are portrayed with a view toward creating empathy for all victims. This impartial lens heightens the tension and tugs at viewers' emotions throughout the entire film. It's a mirror of the complexity of societies controlled by occupying forces. The set piece of the movie, in which three coordinated acts of terror are executed by the rebels, is an unparalleled cinematic achievement. Pontecorvo integrates a myriad of techniques to maximize suspense, tension and dread.\n     I can hone in on a hundred things to admire about this film, but THE ONE THING that really sticks with me is how well it describes the inner workings of revolutionary groups, complete with diagrams and explanations of the pyramidal groups of cells. There is a built in logic to the structure of the FLN that makes it difficult to impossible for captives to disclose sensitive information because they are not aware of it themselves. So well executed is this aspect of the movie that government strategists have used it as a training video to understand resistance groups. The Battle of Algiers is a unique experience in cinema, and one that every cinephile must treat themselves to.",

Judgement of the parties and events involved is largely left to the viewer, not force-fed to us by preachy narration: depending on the viewer, the film could be a case study on how to put down an insurgency, a story about the horrors of war, or a revolutionary manifesto.

Its unique and impressive production values, filming in very realistic documentary style, with thousands of extras, is a magnificent achievement.  It is so successful that I made the same mistake of thousands of other viewers in thinking that documentary footage had been used, but it was not; the film was shot 100% in live action, no documentary footage of any kind.

It\u2019s not terribly graphic in the depiction of torture, but seeing the effects on the actor made it feel visceral and real. The story is then told in flashback from that moment and presents the battle between insurgent rebels and the French government. It is a brutal war filled with horrible bombings and assassinations. It feels reminiscent of stories we hear from American military activities in the Middle East, so there\u2019s a timely parallel that we can draw from this film. It also can re-contextualize some of those things we see in the modern day because in this film the insurgents are the more sympathetic characters. I\u2019m intrigued by this kind of movie because it begs the question from the viewer, \u201cHave we become the bad guys?\u201d The film gives us a look inside the war they are waging and the lengths the rebels have to go to in order to fight for their homeland. The flow of the film reflects the events of the actual war with attacks going back and forth between the two sides, often escalating to more extremes as time marches on. I thought it was interesting how the rebels took advantage of assumptions that the French made about them in order to hide and perpetrate sneak attacks. The Battle of Algiers is an effective film at presenting the horrors of this kind of war, and how the value of human life diminishes so dramatically when you view those humans as \u201cthe enemy.\u201d I don\u2019t like this kind of dark and dismal war film all that much, so I would never say I enjoyed The Battle of Algiers. And even more problematic for me is the fact that I wasn\u2019t drawn to any of the characters presented in the film, so I struggled to form emotional investment. Of course, the brutality of war is upsetting, but I wish there were one person that I cared about more so I could focus my concern on that one life amongst all the horrible bloodshed.

The documentary-style feature allows the film to feel real and the lack of big name celebrities also creates an authentic experience. The film also doesn't need to add tons of fictional subplots that only use the war as a backdrop. Instead, the war is the centerpiece upon which the plot is born. The Battle of Algiers is intense and thought-provoking, though not necessarily enjoyable. Worth a look. Note: Viewed as part of my French Cinema class. Rating: 74",

            "content": "Films have an unparalleled capacity to connect with us and sometimes even to change us. Being a form of art, films are political in their very essence. But sometimes films frame certain political, mental or philosophical issues very specifically in order to make its viewers see this issue from a certain perspective; films essentially act as a window to seeing the world through someone else's eyes. In the words of Slavoj Zizek, 'Cinema is the ultimate pervert art. It doesn't give you what you desire - it tells you how to desire.' Not every political film can be effective; it takes a very precise combination of aesthetics, story plotting, and philosophical thinking to make a film politically effective. With an extremely precise depiction of what actually occurred in a specific place, an intellectually stimulating reflection on violence and torture, as a hymn to independence, and a surreally unbiased view on an easily polarizing subject, Gillo Pontecorvo's La Battaglia di Algeri (The Battle of Algiers) certainly seems to be a politically effective movie.\n\nThe film portrays the Algerian War of Independence that took place during the years 1956-1957. The National Liberation Front (FLN) decides to shake French colonialism and unite Algerians through a series of guerrilla wars in Algiers. The French responds to this 'terrorism' with the merciless hunting and execution of FLN members through torture or 'interrogation' of lesser ranked militants, a strict control of space, and dividing the city into European and Arab (Casbah) parts. The French finally end up 'winning' the war under colonel Mathieu, but 'lost' the war of ideals and essentially 'lost' Algeria as their actions ultimately contributed to a rise in nationalism amongst Algerians. Colonel Mathieu is a fictional character that represents the French leaders General Massu and Colonel Bigeard. Colonel Mathieu largely succeeds in demoralizing sympathizers of the Algerian Independence. However, only two years later a powerful independence movement suddenly started not long after which the French were forced to grant Algeria Independence. The film ends with the vision of large crowds of Algerians marching through the streets demanding independence.\n\nAlthough Gillo Pontecorvo shot this movie after talks with the resistance leader Saadi Yacef, and by receiving help from the government, he manages to make the film largely unbiased by making the viewers equally sympathetic and critical towards both the French and Algerian sides. There is sympathy for the greatly outnumbered French police; they are not demonized but portrayed as men given a job to do. We see the French repression towards the terrorists by the Police and Colonel Mathieu, but we also see the 'terrorists' planning and executing their actions. Colonel Mathieu is presented with a macho appeal with moments of noble fair play. The rebels/terrorists leaders are also shown as intellectual people who are committed to their cause. The movie does not have clear-cut heroes; alternately, everyone could be considered a hero too. The decision of choosing a side, if at all, is made at an entirely unconscious level, as the film does not consciously cajole the viewer to either side.\n\nA remarkably memorable scene in the movie is of three Algerian women who took off their Burqas, cut their hair, and clothed themselves in French fashion. After getting past the checkpoints, they go to a bar, a dance club, and an airport lounge, where they leave handbags full of explosives. As the bombs are about to explode, close-up shots of innocent and vulnerable people like jiving dancers and kids quietly eating their ice creams around these sites were shown; the bombers are shown as if they have accepted this truth and that it was not going to stop them. It is at this point that the audience completely sympathizes with the French. \n\nIn another scene, Mathew appears in the press with the captured terrorist beside him. He then goes ahead and tells the medial that he respects the man's courage and his dedication to the cause. The leader defends the 'terrorist' organization's tactics of putting explosives in baskets and leaving them in public areas in a very eloquent manner by saying, 'Give us your bombs, and we'll give you our baskets'. Mathew then explains to the media the importance of 'interrogation' in order to stop the rebellion. Right after his explanation was finished, the film them cuts to a series of clips showing how the Algerians were being tortured. This gets an entire debate of the ethics behind torturing going on in our head. The film has made a significant contribution to our views of torture today. We first see the image of a small tortured Algerian man with a shattered face who finally reveals where the only remaining leader Ali `La Pointe' is hiding. We then see Ali and his supporters being trapped in their hideaway. The close-up shots revel their tender and soft faces revealing a sort of innocence in them and gravitating the users to show sympathy for them. \n\nThe authenticity of the crowd in The Battle of Algiers is truly stunning. The footage used in the film was in fact so realistic that the producers had to put a disclaimer towards the beginning of the film saying that no real news footage or documentary has been used in the film. Despite a large number of actors in the film, it contains only one professional actor, Jean Martin, who played the part of Colonel Mathew wonderfully. All others in the film were non-actors who were picked off the streets of Algiers. Pontecorvo being able to work directly in the Casbah region among the real people with the help of Saadi Yacef certainly adds another layer of power to the film. Some of the best scenes had the faces of the protagonists, victims, and bystanders in close-up shots without any dialogues or voice-over all shot in a beautiful black-and-white that demonstrates their common humanity. It manages to capture the things that went through the minds of Algerians in a unique way. Although black-and-white communicates much lesser visual information in comparison to color film, this limitation seems to have the effect of involving us more deeply in the story, dialogue, and psychology of the film experience instead of the spectacle (Monaco 126).\n\nAs the US invasion of Iraq went from mission accomplished to a rooted insurgency, the Pentagon invited officers and civilian experts to a special screening of The Battle of Algiers, telling them that the film demonstrates how terrorism must be dealt with. The US in fact played by the same books as the French did by employing mass arrests, tortures, home searches, checkpoints, and blowing up suspected hideouts despite the fact that civilians might be involved. Similar to what happens in the movie, these strategies used by the US largely backfires. One could win every battle but still lose the war. The tactics of intimidating and humiliating people to give up their own country seems to never work out well. The Battle of Algiers has shown the world independence, colonialism, and violence through a new lens and remains a prime example of a politically effective film to this very day.\n\nReferences:\n\nThe Battle of Algiers.

That's grossly inaccurate.  The film simply starts by showing us the ending; then, it retraces all events leading up to the ending.  No flashbacks.  No memories of Ali.\n\n* Several shocking ideas (for a film from 1956):\n\n1. A large group of seven-year-old boys beat a drunk to death to \"improve their community\"\n\n2. French police take vigilante justice against an innocent man's family by exploding his home late one night\n\n3. Revenge bombings by Muslim females of an Air France flight and two cafes (not suicide bombings, incidentally)\n\n4. French military uses waterboarding (I kid you not) and other tortures to extract information, \"false flag\" events (World Trade Center, anyone?) to justify circumventing laws, and \"suicides\" to eliminate \"non-cooperative\" rebel leaders.\n\n5. The United Nations, as usual, is impotent.\n\nConclusions\n\n* Rather ironic that Algeria, the subject of this film, has not participated in the Arab Spring.\n\n* Rather ironic that the FLN now governs Algeria, having implemented a dictatorship under the guise of \"a state of emergency\" almost 30 years ago.",

            "content": "From the title I expected this to be a war movie, but I did not realize Algiers is a city, and the battle is actually a struggle for Algerians to live in their home country without fear of the French who are suppressing them.\n\nI've seen very critically acclaimed classic foreign films before, so I guess I might have had my expectations too high. For example, two of my favorite foreign films are \"Bicycle Thieves\" and \"Rashomon,\" but those films actually do interesting things with their camera-work. With The Battle of Algiers we just get a lot of standard (boring) camera-work with a lot of static shots to focus on conversations about the action rather than focusing on the action itself.\n\nThe best aspect of the film is the characters who are a part of the rebellion and their motivations. We are introduced to one of the main characters in a very interesting way - this secret group of rebels does an initiation on Ali by checking to see if he would be loyal enough to shoot a cop, but they don't tell him this. We can see the manipulation this group exercises, though in their eyes it is necessary recruitment, and we should see it as this too since it is the Algerians who are the victim to French occupation of the city of Algiers as well as of the entire nation of Algeria.\n\nWith the filmmakers choosing to revisit a scene from different view points there is obviously non-linear chronology, but I only understood this at the beginning and towards the end of the film. I was confused how the scene fit into the scenes surrounding it when it was shown for the second time in the film. I will have to rewatch this film some time in the future - after all it is regarded as one of the most important films ever made.\n\nI think I enjoyed the conclusion of this film much more than any part which preceded it, and that's because the conclusion is the most inspirational sequence of the entire movie. It is uplifting to see how Algerians rise up again years after the first rebellion group is decapitated (a metaphor you will understand if you watch the film), and this happens without great explanation. The message implied by the film is that this first group of rebels may not have been successful, but the group inspired the people of its nation to stand strong for justice.",

            "content": "Well, it appears as though someone recognizes Algerian struggles, although we might not need the reminder, because if we're looking at a place where the primary language is Arabic, it should go without saying that it is destined to be a place of brutal warfare. This is a very multicultural story, because it involves the French, and the Arabic of North Africa, and, just for good measure, it's a film by the Italians who weren't even involved in the Algerian War. I can't help but notice that the French are not involved in this production, so Italy and Algeria don't have anyone to censor their union to show how big of jerks the French can be. Maybe Italy is just working the competition, which would be great and all if there was actually some Italian being spoken in this film, which I'm sure plenty of people think is, in fact, French. The best hope the filmmakers have is that some jerk will recognize this as part of the neorealism movement which was distinctly Italian in its being unafraid to get as nitty and gritty as it can with harsh material. I don't know who would recognize that sooner than Algerian struggles, you know, unless someone is pretentious enough to actually know what the Italian neorealism filmmaking movement was... like me. Well, don't worry, people, because even though I like this film just fine, I'm not pretentious enough to lie about the problems in this film.\r\n\r\nThe film isn't able to keep a firm grip on its originality, as it has a tendency to return to tropes as a guerilla war drama, and get there in a somewhat limp manner. Reliant on slow-burn tensions when it isn't simply meditating upon not much of anything, Gillo Pontecorvo's direction delivers on plenty of cold spells which all but stiffen a sense of momentum which is even retarded on paper, through repetitious dragging that you'd figure would be in limited supply, considering this film of weighty subject matter's running only about two hours. The film manages to break even by meeting the dragging with developmental shortcomings, for although the motivations can be understood, few, if any characters feel truly distinguished, making it hard to get invested in accessible role, especially within an uneven storytelling style. The film alternates between pseudo-documentary structurings which are objective in feel, and dramatic intimacies whose subjective value is diluted by the stylistic unevenness, and even by a lack of realization to subtlety. About as often as anything, this film is too subtle for its own good, what with its being so limp and undercooked, but when the subtlety lapses, although it doesn't beat you over the head, a sense of genuineness is lost in the wake of melodramatics and an overemphasis on themes that, honestly, are a little problematic to begin with. There are occasions in which themes regarding terrorism feel a bit glorified, and that ought to be disconcerting enough to general audiences, when the film's other ambitions - in uniqueness, thoughtfulness and style - don't lapse and drive the final product very much short of what it could have been. Still, when ambition is adequately fulfilled, the drama ought to engross, even through a somewhat thin script.\r\n\r\nGillo Pontecorvo's and Franco Solinas' script is flawed, offering undercooked and unevenly present, but intriguing characters behind arguably tight set pieces which, with its gritty realism, draws you in, with the help of a unique storytelling style. Sure, the storytelling structure gets formulaic from time to time, and the pseudo-documentary approach to the plotting is distancing enough when it doesn't conflict with the subjective value of the more intimately dramatic aspects, but there is still something fresh about it that helps in making things feel real, which isn't to say that the stylistic highlights end there. Pontecorvo's directorial style is always worthy of some praise, with visual style that is anchored by Marcello Gatti's cinematography being dated, but with a handsomely fitting grime that helps in selling the chill in the air, like, of all things, some nifty audio style tricks. The style orchestrated by Pontecorvo also has its more effective minimal touches, primarily through plays on Pontecorvo's and Ennio Morricone's tasteful scoring, if not on biting somberness which transcend shortcomings in subtlety and pact with anything from tension to resonance. Yes, the subtlety lapses feel propagandist, and of such questionable themes as the possible glorification of terrorism, while realized moments feel balanced enough to be effective in selling the value of the subject matter. In terms of storytelling, there's not much to praise, but engagement value is very much in the story concept, which offers an intimate study on the rise of guerilla warfare during the Battle of Algiers, backed by themes regarding the power and dangers of terrorism, and a social state which might inspired terrorism that might very well still be relevant to this day. They at least remain interesting to this day, because no matter how much this film tries your patience, it ought to hold your attention comfortably enough to engage adequately, even though it could have done so much more.\r\n\r\nWhen the battle is done, there are formulaic occasions and many a moment of dryness throughout an overlong, undercooked and stylistically uneven course of limited subtlety, until enough momentum is lost for the final product to collapses as underwhelming, but there's still enough effectiveness to the writing, stylistic and directorial highlights, and to the worthy subject matter to make Gillo Pontecorvo's \"The Battle of Algiers\" a fair, if problematic war drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

While not as renowned as \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" or \"Paths of Glory\", \"The Battle of Algiers\" is a better film in my opinion. Whereas some antiwar films rely on powerful speeches said by great heroes to portray their stance, \"The Battle of Algiers\" has no Paul Baumer or Colonel Dax. Neither Ali la Pointe, the leader of the independence movement, nor the French Colonel Mattheiu, who is in charge of the operation, ever states that what he is doing is wrong. Instead, we have only the shots of bodies, both French and Algerian, being carried away from the locations where bombs have gone off. The style of direction resembles that of a documentary, thus bringing about a more realistic feel. You won't find Kirk Douglas or Lew Ayres here. The result is that the characters don't seem larger than life. This is not a drama made by a Hollywood producer looking for an Oscar; but instead, it is a somber portrait of the futility of war. Add in Ennio Morricone's score, and you have a great film that is completely different from almost anything you will ever see.  4 1/2 Stars  2-15-14",

The film was not only won GOLDEN LION in Venice in 1966 and an Academy Awards nomination for BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM in 1967 but also was nominated for BEST DIRECTOR and SCREENPLAY in 1969 for a rare second round. \n\nTHE BATTLE OF ALGIERS impresses its viewers with a haunting collection of close-up portraits of various people (both French and Algerian) under a soul-searching orchestration emphasized by stark chiaroscuro, it was years after Italian Neo-Realism, but the non-professional cast (the only pro is a wiry and bulged-eyed Jean Martin, who commands a stance of military mettle perfectly) and locale-revamping contributes a great amount of authenticity in the final work. There are plenty of overlooking angles with extensive depth of focus to examine and the city and enlighten one's appreciation,   plus there are fleeting montages of torture under interrogation are disturbing but can potently generates a sense of boldness to show audience the cruelty in reality. However the most indelible ones are the waiting-for-the-bombs-to-explode experiences, with camera panning over innocent white victims-to-be unwittingly relish their last moment of hedonism, utterly guarantee a surge of compassion out of shock value terms. \n\nTherefore, the film should also be extolled by its unbiased perspective in telling its stories from both parts, dispassionately channels viewers to witness the vindictive constitution lying underneath common humanity and the aimless and reproachable tit-for-tat acts ensuring. There are radical debates as regards the essence of revolution, a much more penetrating motto is revolution doesn't mean war and terrorism is not a means to win a revolution, which should be indoctrinated all over the world, especially to those tinderboxes where religious and political threats are pervading rampantly at present. \n\nShowing no partiality to either sides is not an easy move since the production was backed and green-lit by one of the government, thus the film is a genuine gem in retaining the integrity and fabricating a gripping panorama of a chain of bloodshed and baring its true color under the stark daylight.",

From the set design to the sound effects and camerawork, the entire film is film purposely in a documentary style retelling what happened in the Algerian War. When reviewing a regular film, you can look at the acting, direction, script, and technical work separately. However, this film feels too real to review in such a manner. All I will say is that the acting, the direction, the script, and the technical work are all perfect for the intentions of the film. The score by Ennio Morricone and the director, Gillo Pontecorve, is suspenseful and perfect for a film that contains acts of terrorism. The script and the editing work together to accomplish a non-chronological yet comprehensive telling of the story. The cinematography and direction also work together to make the film documentary-like. We are taught more in this film about wars that are internalized inside countries. We learn about the suffering of civilians, the extreme uses of manipulation and violence by the military, and the fact that both sides think they are doing the right thing. \"Battle of Algiers\" is an original telling of a true war that indefinitely wounded a nation due to Pontecorvo's single handed spot-on direction.",

With the use of non pro actors he gives the whole film a dose of authenticity that was rarely matched in cinema of this type. The writing underscores the themes of finding your own place in the world and being independent of others, who are not portrayed as the ultimate evil but rather as real human beings. Morricone's music in The Battle is somber and powerful and it most definitely lifts the film and its tough subject matter into sort of poetic ground, and a couple of sequences are especially memorable. One of my favorites is the scene when the kids chastise a drunkard in the streets with a zest and power that would later be exhibited by both the French and the Algerians in their battles.

But more importantly, what makes \"The Battle of Algiers\" a fine film is its incredibly unbiased and objective depiction of the Algerian revolution; a quite tricky feat perhaps, considering the fact that for films like this, it's quite difficult not to choose sides. But by choosing not to be emotionally partisan, \"The Battle of Algiers\" was able to realistically reconstruct the events and make them flow in an intensely natural way. \n     \nOn one side, there's the radical group called the National Liberation Front (FLN), whose tactics border on outright terrorism. While on the other, there are the French paratroopers, whose interrogation methods and counter military acts border on the atrociously inhumane.  Gillo Pontecorvo, the film's director, is quite adamant in highlighting the fact that in the bigger picture, none of them (the FLN and the French military) are completely righteous nor utterly justified in what they do and that the film's real protagonist is not the French's Colonel Matthieu (played by Jean Martin) or the FLN's Ali La Pointe (played by Brahim Hadjadj) but the Algerian people themselves. Ultimately, \"The Battle of Algiers\" succeeds as a film that deals with the universal language of revolution and as a stunning portrayal of an otherwise obscure fragment of history.\n     \nSpeaking as a citizen who is born and raised in a country (the Philippines) that had its fair share of political uprisings, I can easily connect with the Algerian revolutionaries' fevered sentiment towards freedom and colonial deliverance. But what I cannot particularly embrace in the Algerian Revolution is the unnecessary bloodshed, which was starkly captured by the film's black and white photography (by Marcello Gatti) and was intensified by Ennio Morricone's iconic musical score. \n     \nPersonally, I did not enjoy \"The Battle of Algiers\" that much because, after all, there's no way that the film is an entertaining one to watch. It's never a film that wholly glorifies the Algerian Revolution and carelessly trivializes the violence involved in it. Instead, the film shows the titular conflict merely as one thing: a bloody footnote in human history. And for this, I praise the Algerian government, which has commissioned the film's creation, for not peppering it with spirited propaganda. With a faceless crowd as the protagonist and with no sides taken, \"The Battle of Algiers\" is a clear-cut proof of how neutrality can make a cinematic difference.\n\n(Note: In 2003, the film was screened in the Pentagon to highlight the pressing problems faced by the United States in its invasion of Iraq. Quite ironic, isn't it?)",

            "content": "Ultimately, the notions of War is considered by many a superfluous act. A act that stems from various ideological beliefs and political agendas; whether it be the fight for ones independence or the accumulation of power, each agenda seems to culminate to one entity: senseless killing. Besides its viewing of such notions embedded within war, \"The Battle of Algiers\" is quite possibly the epitome of the notion 'Pure Cinema.' It's a film that stands as a monumental technical achievement that only the power of cinema can display: it blends the two visual forums of documentary presentation and cinematic narrative - a presentation that only films can represent. While the themes of liberty against colonialism seem tiresome, Gillo Pontecorvo presents them through an authentic process. Usually with such a film, there is a clear moral distinction: the good people are the ones fighting for liberty, and the bad people are the ones attempting to oppose such efforts. However, Pontecorvo blurs such moral lines to suggest that any man who fights for their certain ideals are subjected to a continuation of senseless killing.\n\nThe narrative revolves around the reconstruction of the historical moment of Algerian natives fight for independence against the colonial French society. The main focus is situated between the years of 1954 and 1957; a fight against two groups: The FLN (National Liberation Front) and the French army paratroopers. \n\nAs stated, the films ability in its presentation of the notions of 'Pure Cinema' is definitely the films most interesting aspect. For the unfamiliar to the term 'Pure Cinema,' let be attempt to enlighten you: The concepts of 'Pure Cinema' refer to the power that films contain to accumulate various technical elements. For example, only the art of film-making can project a moving visual image with the accompany of music and a projection of involving characters. \"Algiers\" displays such a combination of elements, however, he adds an achievement that is quite possible unparalleled with: he combines the notions of cinematic narrative with the accompany of real documentary footage; an emergence that only films can represent. With such an approach, Pontecorvo efforts are immensely elevated as the film provides such an authentic and realistic experience that is undeniably powerful where nothing seems artificial. \n\nAnother authentic aspect is that it's quite difficult to find a moral distinction, especially within a film a that revolves around liberty against oppression. Rather than situate a typical anti-war film of good vs evil - well to be more precise liberty vs oppression - instead, the films plays on our morals; it's quite difficult to choose which group to sympathize for, as both engage in nefarious acts (similar to Mary Shelley's literate classic \"Frankenstein\"). Consider Brahim Haggiag (Hadjadi) initiation into the FLN: he is judged on the fact whether he would shoot a French police officer. It's a terrifying truth that plagues Algiers and ultimately question their actions. \n\nFurthermore, there are various juxtapositions riddled throughout the film. Through one sequence, the political climate is obviously reaching boiling point as the French army continue to harass Algiers. To such problems, the Algiers execute a series of bombings on innocent pedestrians. In another sequence, Pontecorvo presents a montage of truly melancholic torture images, however, directly after this passage he presents a sequence where the Algiers are mindlessly killing a number of civilians; as stated, it's quite difficult to sympathize for a certain group, both engage in the same actions: senseless killing. Even consider the villain Col.Mathieu (Martin). Sure, he's a man that is most definitely the catalyst for the FLN demise, however, his actions are not necessarily as bad as you would you initially conceived; he's a man that respects his enemies actions - even respects their ideals - and gives the final survivors the chance to live through a diplomatic solutions.\n\nPersonally, the film evokes \"The Dark knight\" paradox \"When an unstoppable force meets an immovable Object,\" a line that brilliantly sums up the opposing and mutual standing within any battle of two separate ideals. Additionally, like Nolan's efforts, \"The Battle of Algiers\" displays the destruction of civilians caught within the crossfire, and within the ending, they are the true victors. Through the final shot we are treated to a woman standing for her liberation as Pontecorvo takes us to the years were native Algiers finally gained their independence. The ending is suggesting that for ideological beliefs to succeed, they must not only depend on certain individual instigators, but rather the accumulation of a nation; and - most importantly - it will not happen overnight. The price for freedom is always long-term.\n\nSubjectively, \"The Battle of Algiers\" is not as powerful as I initially expected and the notions of liberty seem ultimately tiresome, however, the film brilliantly succeeds due to its authentic presentation of 'Pure Cinema' and its variable moral distinction; but all in all, Pontecorvo efforts display that all conflicting ideologies will culminate into one outcome: senseless killing.",

He almost openly admits that his forces adopt torture practices and you kinda buy that it's necessary to get the situation under control - he is successful indeed. Jean Martin gives a magnificent performance in portraying this sober and efficient militarian and he's possibly one of the main reasons why the film works so well. He has the elegance and dignity of a military officer and when he talks he spellbinds everyone with his charisma. But what he's saying is terrifying.\n\nEvery action has a reaction. Thus the guerilla warfare between the Algerian partisans and the French policemen and paratroopers in the narrow streets of the Casbah of Algiers is breathtaking, thrilling and the acts of violence are disturbing.\n\nDirector Pontecorvo doesn't shy away from showing the faces of the innocent and unknowing victims of the Algerian bomb attacks as well as the pain of the tortured Algerians.\n\nI can imagine how hard it is to stay objective in this subject matter but this film is as neutral as it gets. It's all about family fathers and husbands who, one day, don't return to their homes in a war they probably don't understand and maybe not even want. It's not morally justifiable what they do (both sides) but at the end of the day a lot of people died out of stubbornness, false pride and inexplicable cruelty.\n\nA film, not easy to swallow, but worth the bite.",

Shot on location with amateur actors evokes the gritty neorealist style of Pontecorvo's native Italy, but he also infuses the character studiousness of the French New Wave. Yet perhaps the film's greatest asset is the one that most distinguishes it from both of these European aesthetics, and that's the sense of narrative urgency and efficiency of montage that it employs, whereas many neorealist and New Wave efforts seemed content to bore its audience into submission. The precise editing and pulsating music (provided my Ennio Morricone and Pontecorvo himself) keeps tension high and prevents the film from ever lagging. Such an immediate sense of storytelling would only just start to pervade American mainstream cinema in the coming years.",

It is deemed a masterpiece, and should be celebrated as a film. But it just didn\u00e2(TM)t do it for me. I understand how the Algerian battle for freedom was important, as well as the interest in documenting how they thought. And it was even kinda interesting seeing examples of the warfare, how the culprits would prepare and commit it.\n\nBut I don\u00e2(TM)t think it was a great film. the documentary style of the film was a good touch, and helped give it a more gritty, believable style, but for about an hour and a half, it seemed the \u00e2plot\u00e2? of the film was very basic: explosion\u00e2\u00a6wait to set up attack\u00e2\u00a6shoot person\u00e2\u00a6shoot person\u00e2\u00a6shoot person\u00e2\u00a6explosion\u00e2\u00a6wait to set up attack\u00e2\u00a6shoot person\u00e2\u00a6shoot person\u00e2\u00a6explosion. The majority of the film felt more like a collection of montages, minutely kept together by an overall story. The scenes even began feeling repetitive. And I know all the Algerians in the film weren\u00e2(TM)t actors, but it detracted from the film, making several performances feel amateurish.\n\nI was impressed by Lieutenant-Colonel Mathieu, the French protagonist, who seemed to show a form of honor and was probably the most interesting character, but he was the only thing that impressed me. I\u00e2(TM)m disappointed that I was left cold by a supposed classic, made even worse that it was only after I found out how big it supposedly was.",

La Battaglia di Algeri is a vast film that intricately shows the beginnings of the revolution of Algeria. You, as the audience, follow many different people from both sides of the fence through the uprising of the terrorist organization known as the FLN. It was mind blowing, and a little eerie, watching this film recently because of how prophetic it truly is. It gives us glimpses into the brain of a terrorist and this relatively new form of warfare. I call it prophetic because 45 years later these exact kinds of war are still being fought in a very similar manner. It's strange to think it was made so many years ago when it feels so relevant today.\n\nThe story plays out in a fairly emotionless way, almost like a documentary, in order to allow the audience to paint the events with their own emotion. It reminds me most of Steven Soderberg's \"Che\" in both style and subject. I think that revolutionary stories should be told this way because it connects with the audience regardless of the cultural mindset they bring into the film. The direction in all of this is basically perfect. Blending stark black and white images with perfectly timed editing made it extremely engaging. And the performances somehow achieve realism without having to be emotionally bare. In a lot of respects these performances are rather dry and should be uninteresting, but wether it was thanks to the direction, ore the story, they always felt like real people and evoked empathy.\n\nThis evocative film is as important today as it was when it came out, and even though I watched it when I was completely exhausted, it was an immersive and beautifully heartbreaking experience.

This coupled with Morricone's invasive yet impeccable score never gives you a moments rest, even when you know what is going to take place.\nI think what makes this film so powerful is the fact that Pontecorvo was able to encompass not only the power and emotion behind a revolutionary movement, but also show the confusion, sorrow, and often senseless violence that are the by-product of these movements.\nAlso, It was hard not to make modern day parallels to the occupation of Iraq. Watching these French officials attempt to find order and use their minds to fight an \"enemy\" who is empowered by their hearts, made me rethink every time I saw an American general on television discussing their efforts in stifling the revolutionary movement.

            "content": "To call The Battle of Algiers a haunting film is a gross understatement. Though it is an Italian-produced film, it is set in Algeria and follows the true story of the Algerians' struggle for autonomy from France during the mid to late 1950s. It blends the bleak realism of Schindler's List with the social commentary of Battleship Potemkin. This is accentuated by vivid depictions of mass genocide, authentic performances and a mesmerizing music score by Ennio Morricone (who is well known for scoring many Sergio Leone westerns in the 1960s). Though it was released forty five years ago, The Battle of Algiers still packs a visceral punch unlike any other film from its era.\r\n\r\nIts style often resembles a documentary film with its raw cinematography and realistic footage. Being the neo-realistic film that it is, almost all of the acting is performed by no-name actors. While this may sound like a bad thing at first, it only adds to the realism, making every torture scene, every shooting, and every death seem as if it were true. Remember, the Hays Code (which would be abolished two years later) was not effective in Italy, so there were practically no restraints on the amount of graphic imagery allowed to be depicted on screen. With this authentic tone, I felt like I cared for the characters much more than the ones in most Hollywood fare of the 1960s. Ironically, they felt much more life-like than the ones characterized by professional Hollywood actors.\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Algiers is an achingly human experience, enhanced by down-to-Earth direction and authentic character portrayals. It is a bona fide masterpiece of world cinema and has retained every bit of its power since its initial release in 1966. I would be hard-pressed to find a film that has aged as well as The Battle of Algiers has.\r\n\r\nFun fact: This was originally supposed to be a Hollywood film starring Paul Newman. I can't see it conveying the same realism or emotion as in the version we now know.",

This film is moving - from Ennio Morricone's seminal musical score that combined both standard \"Dollars\" music to emotionally-disturbing screaming, the Cassavetes-esque acting, the cinema verite camerawork, and the message that in times of violent \"revolution\", everybody is affected - whether or not they would be the French or the Algerians. Nobody is good or bad - we all make stupid mistakes.\n\nIf you need to see a film that will positively change your life, this is where you turn to. Unlike \"Potemkin\" with its unintentionally humorous sequences of people complaining about rotten meat and \"Birth of a Nation\" which propagated racist stereotypes, this will never date itself. Sure, \"Operation Champagne\" sounds like a dumb attack plan name, but what it does affected me.\n\nIf anybody says violence can solve problems, make them see this. It sure as hell does not.\n\nRecommended for ages 15 and older. Kids beat up French drunks, gunshots, devastating bombings, and screaming will frighten younger viewers. This is not your mother's war epic. \n\nThis and Lewis Milestone's cheesy-acted-but-extremely-disturbing \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" are essential. They don't glorify the living Jesus out of war. They show it and make you think whether or not we should be singing \"Over There\" while our fellow friends are losing body parts in Iraq.",

Not only is it a valuable history lesson about a period I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know much about yet, but it is also a realistic representation of both sides in this particular battlefield. As far as I can tell, the makers of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa battaglia di Algeri\u00e2\u0080\u009d didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take sides. Both the Algerian freedom fighters and the French authorities are shown in both a positive and a negative light. The freedom fighters have their reasons to act as they do, though their methods can sometimes be called reprehensible: they kill innocent policemen in cold blood and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shy away from risking the lives of their children or victimizing other innocent individuals from their own group without good reason. The same thing goes for the French, who do not officially use interrogation methods that amount to torture practices, but have no problem applying them anyway if the situation calls for it. Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), the French military leader appointed to suppress the National Liberation Front of Algiers (NLF), is a hardliner, but his lucid ideas and the way he expresses them somehow make one sympathize with his views. When he says that if one is of the opinion the French should stay in Algeria, one will have to accept all the consequences, this seems to make a lot of sense, even though it will mean inhumane action. On the whole, one is inclined to see the French as the bad guys (especially considering the course of history, with Algeria eventually gaining its independence), but it is only fair to say the NLF fighters sometimes use methods that are far less sincere (like with the bomb hidden in the basket to be lowered \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the French could have shot them, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t at that point). Apart from the military actions to be expected, this movie is also very strong in its more quiet, contemplative moments. Not only does Colonel Mathieu present a clear vision on matters, but there is also someone in the Algerian camp who makes clear that this battle can never be won with brutal force alone: if the majority of the population does not genuinely support the cause, the goals will not be reached. The end of the movie proves him right: a few years later, there are spontaneous outbreaks of protest by the people of Algeria that will eventually lead to the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s independent status in 1962. Again, this film is a very accurate representation of an important period in French history, with very impressive images to boot. I very much liked the contrast between the majesty of the wide streets and squares of the colonial parts of Algiers and the shadowy, narrow, sloping alleys in the kasbah, which make a very suitable terrain for guerilla warfare.",

Pontecorvo's film never explicitly condones the violence on either side (even though it is obviously on the side of the Algerians); instead, it depicts all of the violence in gruesome imagery. Shot on location, Pontecorvo's film depicts a world in which governments become the terrorists by bombing innocent women and children and in which women and children take up the cause to free their people. Like the films of Rossellini or Vittorio de Sica, Pontecorvo creates a startlingly realistic vibe to film that almost feels like a documentary. A fine companion to Franz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth, The Battle of Algiers explores the need for violence in revolution. While many contemporary Marxists want to contemplate revolution without bloodshed, The Battle of Algiers demonstrates the bloodthristy nature of oppressive governmental regime and the need to meet such regimes with similar violence. One of the finest films about colonialism ever filmed, The Battle of Algiers remains a moving classic that has even became a textbook piece of military training during the Iraq War because of its depiction of insurrection and urban warfare. A powerful, harrowing piece of cinema that will not soon be forgotten.",

Gillo Pontecorvo's story of Algerian citizens and their desire to overthrow the totalitarian French government is one of the most tense, uncompromising films I have ever seen dramatized of a conflict.  The film splices several film styles, including cinema verite, French New Wave, freeze frames, and rapid cuts to bring the story to life.  The film shows that in every conflict of this nature, there never seems to be a genuine winner or loser in the end, because so much must be lost in order to bring things to a close.  The bombing and attacks scenes cut deeply to the core;  they feel realistic to the point of being painful to watch, but man, do they resonate the overreaching message.  I was honestly reluctant to watch this film initially, but after watching it I feel it may be one of the most criminally underwatched pictures pertaining to war.  Watch closely and you will recognize it as an obvious precursor to Munich and Paul Greengrass's work on United 93 and the Bourne series.",

Many of the scenes look like they were actually captured live. Destruction scenes look amazingly real, riots look like...well, real live riots.

It is one of 3 movies I have seen that are totally perfect in every way; there isn't one creative misstep in this movie- not one.\n\nThe movie is abut an Algerian resistance group's struggle for independence from French colonial rule, and about the French military combating this group- centered around a brilliant army colonel, who is simply there to do his job. The film examines these 2 factions against each other and how they deal with each other. \n\nWhat makes this movie really work is that it doesn't take sides; it observes and speculates. The real 2 viewpoints this movie has to offer is this: why does this conflict have to exist? Who is worse affected here? That is exactly the direction director Gillo Pontecorvo needed to take here- it makes the film even more effective at getting across to the audience the turmoil and destructiveness of the conflict.\n\nThe filmmaking here is also superb- the film is shot in a cinema-verite, documentary type style- the black-and-white photography is really fabulous and it made me feel like I was there in those riots and protests. The movie is also full of content that one could talk about for hours; it's a rare film that not only succeeds on an entertainment level, but will make you think about it.\n\nWhat Pontecorvo has achieved with this movie is nothing short of incredible. Even after being released in 1966- the film hasn't aged a bit- a testament to its greatness. I loved every frame of it; it's one of the best movies ever made.",

I have seen war movies that are influenced by combat, but never a war movie fueled by social and political ideology, especially an ideology not many would consider be held by the protagonists of a story, especially in 1967. While this movie went over the heads of most audiences especially the ones that love imperialism, it managed to mean something for me. It's hard to find movies that portray a side most would consider to be terrorists or criminals as freedom fighters. Its often accepted in most movies and in life that the other side or the unknown is inherently evil, but \"Battle for Algiers\" takes the side of those fighting for a cause instead of those fighting for control. I think the off the street actors is always a toss up , but I found them to be really effective for the story. Observing characters in their most natural state is so fascinating to watch in this movie, it would have been a lesser experience with a trained actor. \"The Battle for Algiers\" perfectly displays how to strategically revolt against imperialism  and win a war of ideas.",

Pontecorvo's film never explicitly condones the violence on either side (even though it is obviously on the side of the Algerians); instead, it depicts all of the violence in gruesome imagery.  Shot on location, Pontecorvo's film depicts a world in which governments become the terrorists by bombing innocent women and children and in which women and children take up the cause to free their people. Like the films of Rossellini or Vittorio de Sica, Pontecorvo creates a startlingly realistic vibe to film that almost feels like a documentary.  A fine companion to Franz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth, The Battle of Algiers explores the need for violence in revolution.  While many contemporary Marxists want to contemplate revolution without bloodshed, The Battle of Algiers demonstrates the bloodthristy nature of oppressive governmental regime and the need to meet such regimes with similar violence.  One of the finest films about colonialism ever filmed, The Battle of Algiers remains a moving classic that has even became a textbook piece of military training during the Iraq War because of its depiction of insurrection and urban warfare.  A powerful, harrowing piece of cinema that will not soon be forgotten.",

Sure they may show the enemy in a light that doesn't make them out to be pure bastard coated bastards, but we aren't meant to root for them in the end.\n\n\"The Battle Of Algiers\" is one of the only films that manages to paint both sides of the conflict in a sympathetic tone, even handedly and devote enough time to both parties. This documentary-esque account of the Algerian Revolution in the 50's may be slightly biased towards the FLN,  but it still shows the French Colonists as men of principle who want to stop the bloodshed, but not at the cost of more innocent lives. The FLN have to accept that innocent lives will be lost in this war, but they cannot afford to make any slip ups in the fight for independance.\n\nThe FLN have Ali La Pointe at the helm, who starts off as a low-level hoodlum only to rise through the ranks at the FLN to lead the revolution against the government, but like one character says in the film: \"It's hard to start a revolution, harder to keep it going and even harder to win\", and standing in Ali + all of Algeria's way are a French Paratroop Unit, called in to \"isolate and destroy the minority\" of the Algerian People e.g. The FLN. They're spearheaded by the only professional actor in the cast who portrays Colonel Mathieu, a man who dealt with the Nazi's in WW2 and falls back into old habits when trying to defeat the FLN, such as underhanded tactics involving torture and bribery to put an end to the fighting.\n\nThe whole film is shot on newsreel footage which is so believable that there's a disclaimer on the film revealing that \"no documentary or news footage is used in this film\". It's based on the memoirs of Saadi Yacef, one of the freedom fighters for the real FLN (he was  also the technical advisor + played a terrorist in this film), the whole film was made in Algeria and the most recognisable name in the entire credits is Ennio Morricone who provides a score which switches from excitement to despair in a heartbeat.\n\nThis film may have a couple tension-filled set pieces which will please people who want to see explosions and death, but it's the elevated non-judgemental stance the director takes in deconstructing the tactics both sides use to plan their attacks on the enemy inbetween each explosion, shoot outs + occasional moments of torture which really holds the film together, an exceptional balancing act by Pontecorvo (a name you don't hear enough of today). \n\nStudied by the IRA and the Black Panthers, screened at the Pentagon for ideas on how to tackle the war in Iraq, \"The Battle Of Algiers\" fairly + realistically portrays both sides of the conflict without judgement, becoming a reference point for us to be a witness to some of the darkest moments of human history. Not only is it one of the most powerful films ever made, it's probably the greatest war film there is, a stunning achievement that is unfortunately still relevant in today's climate.",

            "content": "In \"The Battle of Algiers\" director Gillo Pontecorvo and his crew capture the confusion and visceral nature of guerilla warfare through a masterful implementation of handheld camerawork and degraded imagery. Along with screenwriter Franco Solinas, Pontecorvo focuses on a collective hero, and the rebellious Algerian community of the casbah emerges as the film's protagonist. Through a harsh critique of colonialism, the wounds of oppression, prejudice, cyclical violence and European privilege are expertly exposed. \"Algiers\" remains a timely film, because the denizens of a given country will inevitably fight back by any means necessary when they are unlawfully invaded.",

            "content": "The Battle of Algiers (1966)\n \n\nAn analysis of how Gillo Pontecorvo creates mood and meaning in the opening sequence of 'The Battle of Algiers'.\n\nGillo Portecorvo uses several techniques to convey meaning and establish mood in the opening sequence of 'The Battle of Algiers'. From the opening shot, the viewer can see that the film will be shown in black and white footage. This deliberate decision on the director's part helps the film accomplish a lot. Obviously, it shows that it is set in the past and, along with the handheld camera, this adds to the documentary feel whilst removing any glamour. Also, the fact that colour is absent in this film refers to the issue of race. Another point, whilst on the subject of race, is that all but one of the stars of the film, aren't actors, therefore any prejudices an audience could associate with certain characters due to the actors' lack of previous roles.\n\nIn a high angled shot we see a naked, fragile man sitting on a chair surrounded by soldiers. His vulnerability is immediately established and the oppression of the soldiers is shown by their assertive body language. The lack of music removes any glamour from the scene and it makes the situation seem raw and dark. An important theme throughout the movie is pride and when the soldiers dress the prisoner in their uniform, a biblical image of the humiliation Christ is portrayed. This Christ-like image is very important when considering the ideals of being a martyr that are represented throughout the film. As the prisoner lets out a painful moan, the non-diegetic music score becomes very sad and eventually flows into an army march drumbeat. What follows is a montage of soldier's storming the streets of Algiers. Shots of soldiers running along roof tops almost give the impression of their animalistic nature. After several shots of soldiers swarming into the streets come to an end, a low angled shot of a roof top with soldiers peering down is shown. This makes them seem like birds of prey and resembles a shot used in an Alfred Hitchcock film released three years earlier called 'The Birds (1963)'.\n\nDiegetic sounds of a gun being fired accompany an over the shoulder shot of soldiers raiding a house. Another shot takes place that is very similar to Steven Spielberg's 1993 film 'Schindler's List' in both setting and execution. The camera is positioned high above a set of balcony of flats (like that of the Warsaw Ghetto) and it slowly pans downwards, unveiling the chaos that is happening on each floor.\n\nWhen the soldiers reach a room with tiles on a wall, the music comes to a dead stop. Tension is then built up as the men start to examine the tiles as though something isn't right. The camera then cuts to a close up of a man's face in a very dark, cramped space which the viewer assumes is what is behind the tiles. As the camera slowly pans through each face behind the tiles to see how dirty and scared they look, a soldier shouts at them to come out. The soldier addressing the hiding crowd tells them to surrender since they are surrounded. However, they refuse to acknowledge his negotiations which bring up the idea, again, of being a martyr and standing up for certain beliefs. The dialogue being French also adds to the realism by making it seem more like a documentary (as it resembles real documented footage). A tension-filled silence begins and the camera becomes de-saturated (making the frame look a lot more grainy and filthy) which then leads to the entire frame pausing on Ali la Pointe's face and becoming distorted and blurred. This is a narrative technique used by the director to show the viewer that what will follow will be a flashback from the character's point of view. The fact that the frame becomes distorted and desaturated before and during the blur transition effect suggests that the following flashback will tell the story of a distorted situation in a gritty and violent atmosphere.\n\nOverall, I feel that this is a very successful opening and sets up the mood of the upcoming events perfectly. In the first five minutes important aspects of the film such as the ideals held by the characters and the main facts about the revolution are addressed. I also feel that showing the outcome of the film at the beginning immediately creates confusion and intrigue, and as well as this, adds the notion of dramatic irony to each scene following.",
