    "summary": "Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) has just finished college and, back at his parents' house, he's trying to avoid the one question everyone keeps asking: What does he want to do with his life? An unexpected diversion crops up when he is seduced by Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), a bored housewife and friend of his parents. But what begins as a fun tryst turns complicated when Benjamin falls for the one woman Mrs. Robinson demanded he stay away from, her daughter, Elaine (Katharine Ross).",

            "content": "Watched again in April 2023.   Dustin Hoffmann plays a stalker. Katherine Ross plays a co-dependent frat girl. Yeah, Anne Bancroft plays a love-starved, sex-starved middle age rich housewife. Everybody else just simply talks too much.  I honestly got tired of Dustin Hoffman doing nothing, lots of doing nothing. If I were \"Elaine\", I would have gotten a restraining order.\n \nMaybe I liked it in 1967 because everyone raved about it.  I didn't know any better. In 2023 I still probably don't know any better, but I can now say that it is boring and much ado about nothing.    The ending was kinda neat, though.",

The reviews of The Graduate are generally divided between completely favorable or absolutely negative, which means there is a common ground in between where both are right. On the one hand, it's a movie that was ahead of its time, with the acting, cinematography, sentimental elements which were not too common at the time, and even the plot which though it didn't offer much was among the first of its kind. On the other hand, there's slow pacing, and as aforementioned some things are unrealistic and do not make sense, especially in the way the characters act. However, The Graduate is slightly redeemed by its ending, and though maybe not a must-watch, it's still a timeless watch for cinema enthusiasts.",

            "content": "The Graduate works because director Mike Nichols puts emotion front and center. It's a film that must be felt and those feelings of relatable sympathy make it timeless. The film is about a quarter-life crisis. It's the post-college season where a person drifts aimlessly without purpose or direction. Benjamin Braddock is a rudderless boat and his struggle rings true. \n\nThe more I watch The Graduate the more I like it. The film is 50 years old yet every generation there is a new batch of young adults who discover it. Nichols was able to capture that transitional period with raw honesty. Based on the novel by Charles Webb, The Graduate is the perfect marriage between Nichols and Webb. Nichols was an experienced stage director and on his second marriage. At 36, he was the ideal age to reflect on the quarter-life crisis without being too far past it. Webb wrote the book at age 24 shortly after graduating Williams College. \n\nThe character of Ben is based on Webb. Nichols took Webb's story and turned it into cinematic art. It's a modern time capsule of 1967. It reflected and spoke to a generation the way Easy Rider did two years later. The movie only works if Ben is an underdog. Ben wants to be treated like an adult but he is far from ready. But Ben should be careful what he wishes for. Ben's parents parade him around as the golden boy. They are proud of his accomplishment and all their friends want to know what's next. \n\nBen feels the weight of this pressure. He just experienced four years of freedom in Mass. and now he's back under his parents' roof. There's a shot where we can see Ben through the fish tank. Ben is drowning, the melancholia is present. When he tries on some scuba gear in a later scene he's underwater again. Ben, however, is about to surface for air. Mrs. Robinson initiates an affair with Ben and treats him like an adult in the process. \n\nBen is in a state of depression and apathy and she takes him out of it. She's a sweet, charming, and loving authority that Ben can submit to. This isn't the manic pixie dream girl we see in some movies. This is the seductive mature dream cougar. The relationship is offered as sex without love which becomes a problem for Ben. When Mrs. Robinson first seduces Ben, he is looking at a portrait of Elaine. He then sees an unclothed Mrs. R reflected in the glass frame. Mrs. Robinson is simply a reflection of what Ben wants. Elaine is the real thing. Elaine is who he falls in love with. \n\nMike Nichols uses the language of film to tell a story like no one else. The philosophy of classic Hollywood is that the audience should not be aware that they are watching a movie. Stuff like cutting and scene transitions were hidden. But Nichols took a risk with The Graduate and it paid off. He broke the rules. He frequently reminds the audience that they are watching a director with style and vision. He match cuts between the pool and the hotel room. He does establishing shots from a crane with a camera zoom. He puts the camera in voyeuristic places through car windows. He does a long take in the dark with just a visible lamp.\n\nThe first line of the film is a pilot saying, \"Ladies and gentleman, we are about to begin our decent into Los Angeles.\" This film is about Benjamin's decent into messy scandal and heartbreak. Is Ben an antihero? He is in the sense that there's a greater villain. Mrs. Robinson is the one cheating and Ben is complicit. The film front loads Ben with sympathy which is the key to the character. Ben is likable and relatable enough for the audience to invest in him and care about the outcome. \n\nWhen Ben confesses to Elaine about the affair its painful and devastating. In the foreground Elaine wears a smile that quickly fades. In the background is a rain soaked and crushed Mrs. Robinson. The first half of the film is perfection. It's a whirlwind romance that ends with the inevitable pain of failure. The second half is Ben paying for his sins with suffering. Ben is a deeply flawed character but he's not a static one. He makes different mistakes. \n\nFor Ben, being with Mrs. Robinson represented the adult world. When Ben pursues Elaine it's an overcorrection. Ben moves to Berkley where he apologizes to Elaine and explains that it was Mrs. Robinson who seduced him. Elaine then forgives Ben and considers taking him back. Then all hell breaks loose. Irony is sweet. Mrs. Robinson turned Ben into a person that Elaine would want to date, a confident guy with experience. \n\nBen also had social proof on his side from the multiple times the Robinsons and the Braddocks tried to set Elaine and Ben up. At one point, Ben says to Mrs. Robinson \"you don't think I'm good enough for your daughter\" and he's right. The aimless, sheepish, lost cause Ben isn't good enough. He's a weak man who is made stronger by growing pains. This cause and effect parallels the film's end. It's Ben's fault that Elaine is getting married to Carl Smith, the \"make out king.\" And here's why. The affair between Ben and Mrs. R leads the Robinsons to get a divorce. \n\nSimply put, Elaine can't go home. Her financial security is gone and she can't stand\nher mother. If Elaine drops out of school and marries Carl for financial security then she's repeating the past like her mother did. Ben must try and stop Elaine from making a similar mistake. It's his last shot of redemption. I'm not optimistic about Ben and Elaine's future. I don't think they end up together. But I'm encouraged by Ben's development. Ben fighting off the wedding attendees with a cross is 180 degrees from the Ben we first see. He's a man transformed.\n\nSimon & Garfunkel are my favorite band. The songs created by this folk-rock duo are haunting, stirring, and moving. The combination of Paul Simon songs with Mike Nichols images is truly magnificent. The songs are used very effectively. Nichols often uses the whole song and is fond of repeating songs. The Graduate is one of my favorite films. It's the kind of movie that makes me want to make movies. Mike Nichols is an inspiration. It's the kind of film that opened my eyes to the transcendent journey a film with mature and adult themes could take me on.",

            "content": "Much has been said about how good The Graduate is. I have one word really to say, Amen! This film is wonderful in every way, from the cinematography, to the acting to the soundtrack.\n\nACTING- The acting is really quite excellent in The Graduate. In his first major role, Dustin Hoffmann(a great actor) is sensational as the innocent college graduate, while Anne Bancroft is also excellent as the older woman who seduces him. And Katherine Ross was surprisingly effective as the daughter Hoffmann's character falls for.\n\nDIRECTION- Mike Nichols' direction is very, very good, easily one of his best directing jobs. He ensures flawlessly that there isn't a single wasted scene while watching The Graduate. And in my opinion, he thoroughly deserved the best director Oscar.\n\nSCREENPLAY- I don't know when to start when saying how good The Graduate's script is. The humour is sophisticated and has the bite of a dry martini.\n\nCINEMATOGRAPHY- The Graduate also benefits hugely from having beautiful cinematography, and it is quite innovative too. It also has a sense of visual irony about it, especially in the scene where Hoffmann runs to the church.\n\nSOUNDTRACK- Maybe I am biased because I am very fond of Simon and Gunfunkel. In The Graduate, the soundtrack is so moving and beautiful, perfectly captures the mood of disaffected youth seething beneath the laid-back exteriors of the 1960s.\n\nSTORY- The Graduate works brilliantly as a satire, and the story is never less than engaging and thoughtful.\n\nSo all in all, The Graduate is a wonderful film on every level, one of my personal favourites of the 1960s that's for sure. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "The Graduate is art.  But like some art - it doesn't always work.  And when you walk away, you shrug your shoulders and wonder what all the fuss was about.  The amazing amount of perfection in this movie is entirely due to the camera shots and acting - they are both iconic.  But the story is line is so bad that you wonder why you are watching it.  Over stereotyping the parents as silly establishment mindset is cheap and almost cartoon like.  Switching the \"lost rich kid\" main character, Dustin Hoffman, to your basic stalker after one extremely bizarre date for the second half of the movie is creepy and makes no sense.  He is not the person who spent the first half of the movie searching for the meaning of his life, but actually a weird nerdy stalker. And then there is Emily, the object of his so called desire, who falls for this guy after one horrible date wherein she learns he is capable of being hurtful to attain his goal, and then ask for forgiveness.  And on top of that, she finds out he has been shagging her Mother. Why she doesn't run from him and call the police when he follows her to Berkeley, again, makes no sense.  And then of course, there is the Mother, played very deftly by Anne Bancroft.   Also lost in her loveless marriage, she takes on the affair as her escape.  Never mind that it is with the son of her husband's partner in business, and that she lies about it as a \"rape\" when caught by her family, but again, no one calls the police.  But she at least has the one common decency to set boundaries with Dustin that he cannot date her daughter.  And of course, this idiot doesn't understand why that should be.   Wouldn't that make a lovely Christmas story at the dinner table for everyone to enjoy!  And the final straw of the movie is the strange abrupt ending wherein Dustin Hoffman is sliding back into his lost character on the bus ride after he wins the girls heart and \"rescues\" her from the life of the establishment at the very alter of her marriage.  Again, the transition makes no sense.  The plot is simply bad.",

As a coming of age story, Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin sways towards the sort of entitlement and \"rich boy boredom\" that so often renders a protagonist detestable and requires the film to teach them a lesson in order to emerge with a positive perception. The viewer's frustration begins to mirror that of Ben, but becomes directed towards him rather than his trials. Hoffman plays the role's immaturity giving way to a determined independence marvelously, but does seem too old for his part. Bancroft is quite good as the seductive Mrs. Robinson, whereas Ross struggles a bit towards the end with a lack of emotional depth in her relationship with Ben. The Graduate's flaws also include predictability, as the second half of the film holds no surprises. Some of the filmmaking techniques on display are noticeably stylish and specifically orientated such as its zooms and cuts, although I have not quite decided if these elements provide a tasteless bombardment of style or really poignant signposting. The lighting and general cinematography tends to be a highlight. \n\nI do find The Graduate riveting despite its flaws. Simon and Garfunkel's music really beds into the film and produces a melancholic atmosphere with slightly sinister undertones, the performances are largely splendid, and if regarded as a critique and satirisation of its privileged protagonist's aimlessness, as there is a substantial case for, it succeeds on the most vital levels.",

In addition, Nichols leaned towards longer takes than were used at the time, an example being the Scuba scene early in the film where Dustin Hoffman's character remains submerged in the pool to escape those around him.

The acting felt natural and the dialogue was crisply humorous without sacrificing any emotional weight. The pool scene, which has actually become pretty cliche in movies about teen angst these days, is an example of Nichols ability to create an emotional reaction in me and project the same feeling of dread and anxiety I would imagine Hoffman's character is feeling at that time. The pacing was near perfect as this run time flew by for me, but my one critique, and probably what keeps me from rating this higher, was that I didn't particularly care for the ending, which I felt was rushed and half baked, albeit maybe not out of character. 8.5/10",

He is seduced by an older woman Mrs. Robinson (Anne Brancroft) and then winds up falling in love with her daughter Eleanor (Katharine Ross).  The other main character in this film is Simon & Garfunkel music, including \"The Sound of Silence\" and \"Scarborough Fair.\"\n\nThis was quite a risqu\u00e9 movie back in the 1960s what with a young college graduate having an affair with a much older woman and then falling in love with the woman's daughter.  In this day and age, it is rather tame in terms of plot.  \n\nHaving seen this for the first time, I was a little surprised at how they seemed to run out of dialogue and spend half the movie as if it was a collection of music videos.  Not that I am complaining since the Simon and Garfunkel music is incredible.\n\nAll three leads do a nice job \u2013 Hoffman plays awkward really well.  Bancroft comes across as a lonely woman looking for something in what appears to be a loveless marriage.  You can see why she would seek comfort in the arms of a much younger man.  Ross comes across well although she has the least to do except at the very end of the movie.\n\nThe movie is good.  The dialogue is witty, but as I mentioned before it seems like they had to supplement the story with lots of musical interludes.  They probably should have beefed up the plots or extended the conversations.  It does surprise me that this is in the top 10 of all movies of all time.  Definitely worth watching if you have never seen it, but this won't leave you amazed.",

She always had a problem with sex and Mrs. Robinson forced her to confront her own sexual inadequacy.

There are also a few good dryly comedic moments between Bancroft and Hoffman juxtaposed quite nicely against the sudden but slow eruption of emotion in a sea of solemnity when the issue first surfaces of a potential relationship between Elizabeth Robinson and Benjamin -- triggering Mrs. Robinson's seething insecurity-fueled anger.\n\nHowever, there is absolutely no discernible depth of relationship at all between Elizabeth Robinson and The Graduate, who have one tumultuous date, that provides any foundation for a believable expression of love between the two to sustain the premise of the rest of the movie.  That being the case, however, it makes some sense of the attenuated, uncomfortable, joyless ending where it seems to be sinking in that the pair may not have accomplished anything worthwhile after all.\n\nOverall, the language of the script and scenes between Benjamin and Elizabeth seem to be so ridiculously childish a stumbling toward a marriage proposal of sorts, that in addition to being utterly lacking in credibility it reminds one of Hoffman's later flat performance as an idiot savant in Rain Man; this time in co-ed stereo.  \n\nBottom line:  A great musical score cannot save a sound premise unsupported by an utterly believable script and robotic, shallow relationships between between Benjamin and every other character in the story.

The cinematography, writing, direction, music and the capturing of a place and a time is superb. Anne Bancroft as the iconic Mrs. Robinson is so memorable that the term has become used in pop culture to refer to any predatory cougar. The coming of age element of the film has been equally influential as Benjamin's ennui and loss of innocence has clearly influenced most future films in the genre. I was expecting it to feel dated and for the material to have been shocking at the time but tame by today's standards but no, even on TV 3 at ten o'clock at night this film plays to a wide audience.\n\nBenjamin Braddock, Dustin Hoffman, was a successful track athlete at University and has recently completed his degree when we first meet him. He has returned to his hometown and experiences increasing pressure from those around him to conform to a lifestyle he may not want. One night the wife of his father's colleague Mrs. Robinson, Anne Bancroft, gets him to drive her home and famously attempts to seduce him. A few nights later he succumbs to her charms and they begin a clandestine affair. The relationship becomes more complicated when he begins a relationship Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine, Katharine Ross, but Mrs. Robinson sabotages their relationship and pushes Benjamin away from the family.\n\nSo many iconic scenes appear in this film from the scuba diving to the seduction to the final scene on the bus. These are all rightfully iconic because there is something special to all of them as one conveys fear and anxiety, awkward sexuality and the nervousness of an unknown future. You feel all of the emotions that Benjamin feels so strongly in this scene as Nichols is able to create a feeling of claustrophobia and also a funny but still sexually titillating moment in which Bancroft's nude breasts flash across Hoffman's shocked face. As a teenager I feel very nervous about my future and although I doubt I will look to one of my father's colleagues to aid me in my coming of age I am aware I will make stupid, irrational decisions as I leave university.\n\nThe performances are all pretty great, although I don't understand Ross's Best Supporting Actress nomination, but Hoffman and Bancroft are the clear standouts. Hoffman being nervous and weird is incredibly entertaining and his use of blank expressions to convey just how confounded Benjamin is works brilliantly. Bancroft's performance unfortunately overshadowed the other great performances she gave, check out The Pumpkin Eater (1964) and The Turning Point (1977), but this is not for no reason because she completely inhabits her role in this. Her authoritative, almost bitchy style of conversing with people leaves you with no doubt that she commands everyone else around her with little trouble and yet towards the end of the film we understand just how sad she is as a human being. Bancroft is obviously sexy but she can be one of the most intimidating forces on any screen when she wants to and we feel Benjamin's fear when she yells \"It's too late!\"\n\nThe final absolutely iconic thing I am going to remark upon is the use of the Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack. Playing \"The Sound of Silence\" over Benjamin's blank and despondent face sends a stronger message than any dialogue could and the songs are meaningful and well placed in addition to be entertaining and catchy. \"Mrs. Robinson\" and \"April Come She Will\" are exquisite and you sometimes feel torn between appreciating the visuals or the audio.\n\nThis is ranked 17th on the AFI's 100 Years\u00e2\u00a6100 Movies List and although I am slightly surprised they didn't pick more \u00e2~serious' fare I am glad that this excellent film receives the recognition it deserves. Bancroft lost the Academy Award for Best Actress to Katharine Hepburn for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967) which is an absolute crime and we can only be glad that Bancroft won for the great but less brilliant The Miracle Worker (1962). You really must watch this film because it is both important and very watchable.",

Teetering between the listless lyricism of the Summer of Love and the outright tumult of the following year, the combination of Simon & Garfunkel's poetic harmonies with Buck Henry's acerbic wit create a dizzying, dazzling affect of hopeless yearning to match the intimate-yet-claustrophobic camerawork. It is a simple story filled with complex characters, both tremendously beautiful and bawdily taboo, a study in contradictions that seeks no easy resolution. If only Benjamin (and apparently Hoffman) weren't such a complete creep, though I suppose that sort of entitled disenchantment among young white men is just as true today as it was in the late Sixties, too.",

Its most quotable line is uttered in the first 20 minutes, and the best scenes almost all occur in the first half. Dustin Hoffman is perfectly cast as the awkward young adult at a crossroads, as in Anne Bancroft as the zesty older woman whose life is far less glamorous than our hero initially thinks. The romance between them is far more convincing than the one between Hoffman and Ross, mainly because I could see what those 2 saw in each other. The 3rd act is where things fall apart, as the film goes from being a satire on love and fulfilment and becomes a creepy melodrama centred around a deranged stalker. The lead start off likeable and innocent but ends up being only a few steps away from being a psycho killer. He acts as though he deserves Ross's character and is content to follow and harass her until she changes her mind. It makes him come across as seriously detestable, and I had no desire to see things work out for him. Also, while the soundtrack might feature the legendary duo of Simon and Garfunkel, only a few of their songs are featured, and some are played up to 3 times, making it feel like the film is often struggling for something to fill the gaps. If it had managed to sustain the quality of the first half into the second, I would highly recommend it. But as is, I'm glad I saw such a talked-about and influential picture, I was just so frustrated at how much better it could, and should, have been.",

As much as general and diverse the message grows socially, the real raunchy methods up-taken by the writers is bold and vivid enough to leave a long lasting impression. Sweeping of all the perspective, opinions, schemes and what not sort of drama, within around 100 minutes, the anticipated intentions are circled up with an adequate storytelling. If its first act seems humorous and light enough to nail any sort of intensity on the board, the second act adds plethora of spice to the tale with jealousy, politics and selfishness that shows the three dimensional side of these perfectly cooked characters.\n\nAnd with a jarring last act that gives you goosebumps for its potential to shift the entire tone into an electrifying love story that corners our protagonist to succeed against all odds, the finesse is to aspire from. The nail biting climatic act offers this ethically complex situation a cathartic release which no matter how much crowd pleasing it may seem, is also wisely crafted to be mature. Hoffman as the obedient student and of like-able persona has a completely different identity hidden behind him.\n\nFrankly this is not a pleasant figure and Nichols makes sure he never tries to justify it which would be uncalled for. But justice is to be served, and serving it with an intention to draw out a cinematic arc for the character, there resides a quote that cannot define it all more than enough, \"I'll give you 20 dollars for a dime.\" says Hoffman in his lowest pit. Bancroft and Ross, possibly the combination of the most bizarre triangle love story are holding onto their parts dearly. The Graduate not only qualifies but is undoubtedly a top contender.",

Crying wolf in rape culture, manipulation within relationships, control and dominance by authority, and the anxiety that comes with being young and inexperienced. Mrs. Robinson is obviously trying to drown out her worries rather than face them, and knows exactly what strings to pull to get her way. She needs therapy, but instead she self-medicates with booze and a boytoy. Though Ben is an adult, he is still easily swayed and malleable to her whims, which ends up costing him down the road. Some might find Ben's obsession in the realm of stalking, but it's also of note that he is someone with a reputation that has been tarnished by hearsay and needs to have it righted not only to clear his own self-perception, but so that he can pursue who he truly loves. The end scene is also iconic and often talked about because even though they have made a big decision and know it was the right thing to do, they still are young and really are scared for the future. When it comes to being a married couple, this is something you face dead in the eyes every day. You don't know how to be the breadwinner, the homemaker, the mother, the father, the leader, sometimes not even the diplomat or how to be the mature one, and you still need to smile together and get on the bus of life where it takes you, knowing everything will be alright down the road.

Take a look at the story of Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), a 21-year-old who gets caught up in a sexual journey with the mother of the girl he loves, the movie script is perfectly told, always exploring all sides of the story, the pains, anxieties and fears of all the characters, and we are glazed and stuck to its narrative, even being a romantic comedy, a genre that massively searches for cliche. Benjamin is a character who is embraced by loneliness, he is completely desperate to quench his emptiness, even though he may not know it, when Ben is invited to participate in a sexual adventure, this temporarily fills his void, but after a while he realizes that it only leaves him empty, and when falling in love with Elaine, he sees a desperate attempt to get rid of this \"darkness\", Ben is a completely broken character, that even in love, he has no idea what to do, loneliness who pursues Ben is the drama of many, and the way she is explored in the film is spectacular. Not only does the script have its merits, but the direction too, speaking first of the camera angles, aiming always show well in zoom and then rolls a large zoom out, always showing how small the character is in the scenario, in addition to always using outlets and not to abuse in the cuts, even being a 1966 movie, besides, we have great songs on the soundtrack, sometimes it may seem little distoante or repetitive, but the track talks with the drama of Ben, besides, we have a great editing and sound editing, as well as beautiful photography. Dustin Hoffman is a great performer, and he is one of the pillars that makes the script get to explore so many themes without the actor, the movie would perhaps be a dramatic romantic comedy, we also have the magnificent Anne Bancroft. The use of the spectacular song \"hello darkness my old friend\" in the end contrasts somewhat the idea of ??what the film is going through - unless it is interpreted that the character still feels empty - in the end, it is not a perfect movie, but it accomplishes everything that promises and a little more, a lot more.",

She knows exactly what she's doing, the way she seduces Ben to do what she wants. It's so twisted to think that Mrs. Robinson would've had sex with Ben on her daughter's bed. Like wtf?! That's like such a power move. It's almost like her saying, \"Never mind Elaine, because when I'm through with you, you're only going to be thinking about me\". There's obviously some marital problems between Mrs. Robinson and Mr. Robinson - they don't have sex as they don't sleep in the same bed. This explains why she's so eager on having sex with Ben. And poor inexperienced naive Benjamin seems to be a friendless virgin.\n\nDustin Hoffman's comedic brilliance really shines. All his different mannerisms and little sounds he makes when he gets nervous. Anne Bancroft looks smoking in this movie. I love the highlights and the way she styles her hair. She makes for a very believable cougar who is out for some long overdue sex. What we witness in this movie is a boy's journey into becoming a man and feeling love for the first time. Not only with the loss of his virginity, but also the events that take place after with Elaine and her parents.

Criterion did an amazing restoration. That sequence where Ben looks at the chimps hugging and then zooms to the gorilla in the background had me laughing so hard. That was so good.

I suppose part of it might be a generational thing, but the plot doesn't really speak to me as someone who was born almost 10 years after it came out. For one thing Ben Braddock isn't a likable character, and he continually makes horrid decisions. I get frustrated with him instead of empathizing with him. Dustin Hoffman does well at playing the confused and aimless young man, but when he transitions into obsessive stalker mode I can't stand him. Anne Bancroft is supremely charming as the seductive Mrs. Robinson and she seems to be the only person in the movie with a brain. At every turn she is surrounded by clueless morons, and yet she knows everything that is happening (and often what will happen in the future.) I almost pity her more than anyone else in the film even though she's supposed to be sort of a villain. There's so much in The Graduate that I struggle identifying with, and not much of the humor is effective for me. I think I can see the elements that work for others, but the fact that it is a cultural touchpoint seems strange to me. It's a very straightforward plot that doesn't surprise all that much, and I struggle to find a single character I care about through the whole thing.",

When I was at my friend's house, I was looking through his films, and I felt that I wanted to watch Final Fantasy: The Spirits Awaken until my friend comes back as he bought even more movies. However, there were some distractions that didn't got me to see it, and for the movies my friend bought, we decided to watch a movie that he bought, and that was this one, which I'm glad that I finally got to see it as I heard that it's a classic movie, and it really is. I wouldn't really know what the 60s was like since I wasn't born in that time and I haven't watch much films that were around that time either, I'll just put that out there, but it seems like the movie brings the vision about a serious subject that was probably not familiar in that time, and that is cougar. The way that it was talking about really seem to be realistic, and really ahead of its time, like almost the rest of the movie. Even at his first main role, Dustin Hoffman is terrific in this, he's got the charms, and the comedic timing that got me laughing in some scenes. Anne Bancroft plays a seducing character very well that it makes sense why Dustin Hoffman's character would be intimidated by her. The songs are surprisingly catchy to this day, which I didn't know that Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel was in this, and the writing by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry is very well written that it created memorable characters that have to deal with legitimate problems. Even though there are some funny stuff in here, the movie does take itself seriously, and it's executed very well, although some people might find Dustin Hoffman's character a little creepy when it was getting to the end. When it gets to the end of the film, it leads up to one of the funniest parts of the movie, and gets to a resolution that I'm not quite sure whether it's a happy ending or not. I was getting a little bothered by the fact that it was getting a little too long in getting to the destination, but then I thought about it, and realize that it made it look more realistic that it does take some time getting there. In the end, The Graduate is a terrific movie that I'm surprised it took me so long to finally get to watch it.",

            "content": "The Graduate is one of those films that is both dated and timeless at the same time. It was written for the rebellious teens and college students of the time, but still has a lot of universal forces driving the plot. Ben is our anti-hero who is the tortured soul that has no idea how to live his life. All he knows is that he is constantly under the thumb of his parents and their friends. His affair with Mrs. Robinson, his eloping with Elaine, and the way he spends his spare time all revolve around a deep need to satisfy them. Him and Mrs. Robinson make the movie stand out, as they are easily character staples in cinema while the other characters aren't nearly as developed. Just goes to show that you don't have to have a star-studded involved cast to make a pertinent film. A personal theory I have about The Graduate is that Mrs. Robinson's affair with Ben was her way of keeping him from marrying Elaine, in her insane drive to be over protective. She nearly succeeds until they run from the church away from her. There is much debate about the ending of the film, the long bus ride with the altering faces and the Simon and Garfunkel pop song \"Sound of Silence\". Think of it this way, these two newly grads have never lived a life outside their family, and now they are at a state where they can't come back to them. A dark aspect to this coming of age tale, but it takes a turn to discuss the destruction of the family structure long before it was the norm to do so. It's hard to find anything wrong with a film that does so well at a subtle pushing of the envelope as this one does.",

            "content": "For those who do not know much about this 1967 flick, here is an introduction. The Graduate is an American comedy-drama directed by Mike Nichols. It traces the journey of a 20 something college graduate Benjamin, who in a period of depression about his future, is seduced by his father's law partner's wife Mrs Robinson and then goes on to fall in love with her daughter Elaine.\n\nThe movie was something of a blockbuster at the time of release, with cine-goers identifying with the character of Benjamin and his confused mind. The movie also found appreciation from critics with noted critic Roger Ebert calling it the \"most funny movie I has seen in ages\". Over the years, the movie has grown in stature and is now regarded as one of the most influential movies of the \"Roaring 60s\" and a cult classic. It was selected to preserved in 1996 in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". It is regularly featured in greatest movie lists including the American Film Institute's Top 100 movies and the Empire magazine's Top 500 movies.\n\nNow, with all this praise showered on this film, and me personally being a fan of Dustin Hoffman after watching Straw Dogs and Rain Man, I was naturally inclined to watch this movie. Add to all this, the impact of this movie in pop culture. To quote an example, in \"500 Days Of Summer\", a movie I loved, a critical plot turn occurs after both leads watch The Graduate and one of them is significantly moved by the movie while the other isn't. All this got me intrigued and I was pretty excited when I got to watch it yesterday!\n\nAND I WAS DISAPPOINTED.\n\nTo my understanding, there is no definite plot; much like the Benjamin state of mind, the movie appears confused. Characters come and go, affairs start and end, and you never know. Even the lead characters are poorly written, with none them having emotional heft. You don't identify with them, neither do you feel for them. I watch Benjamin (Dustin Hoffman) for close to two hours and I don't know what kind of person he is; I am as confused as he is. Anne Bancroft playing Mrs Robinson does a good job as a cold manipulative creep, but the weak writing suffocates her. Same goes with Hoffman. A bunch of talented actors are cowed down by the writing.\n\nElaine Robinson, played by the beautiful Katherine Ross, brings nothing new to the table. The same old \"Damsel In Distress\" story. Even characters so simple as that of Benjamin's parents was messed up. They seemed invisible while being visible. Creepy!\n\nChoppy editing made matters worse and I wasn't impressed with the cinematography too.\n\nNow to the good stuff, though there aren't many. The performances, to begin with. Dustin Hoffman gives an excellent performance as a graduate with confusion and uncertainty surrounding his future. His vulnerability is well portrayed, despite the weak writing. Same goes with Anne Bancroft. She excels as the manipulative Mrs Robinson who is unafraid to demand what she wants. \"An insufferable creep\", as Ebert called her. There are some genuine moments of comedy too in the film, one particularly being when Mrs Robinson attempts to seduce Benjamin. It was hilarious. But such scenes are few and far between.\n\nThe music was impressive too, though I thought it was a bit overdone. But what I loved most was the last few seconds of the film (which I will not reveal). It points towards an uncertain future despite a happy ending.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie as a whole failed to impress, and if you ask me, give it a miss. You won't regret it.\n\nI always say that a good movie will emotionally connect with you and you will respond to it. But THE GRADUATE failed, and failed miserably.",

            "content": "\u00e2??This is Benjamin. He\u00e2??s a little worried about his future.\u00e2??\n \nNo matter what age you are in life, this would have been a sentiment plaguing your mind for the future is unpredictable. What happens when you finish studying? Are you going to start working immediately? Are you happy with that job? Or is this not the right future for me? What do I do? Mike Nichols\u00e2?? The Graduate may revolve around the uncertainty of graduating childhood, but boy does it get to grips with adulthood, as this film for many people is their first sexual fantasy. The Graduate decides to take that young man worried about his future, and transform that worry into pleasure as Benjamin sexually wanders into the Robinson family.\n \nThe Graduate tells the tale of a recent college graduate named Benjamin Braddock, who has no well-defined aim in life. This open ended storyline entitles the film to go down any road it desires for Benjamin needs to become enlightened to his life\u00e2??s calling. The script\u00e2??s ingenuity is that no one would have expected Benjamin to be seduced by a middle-aged, married woman named Mrs Robinson, and then proceed to fall in love with her daughter Elaine. The Graduate\u00e2??s combination of a young man\u00e2??s sexual and emotional escapades within the same family is bound to cause fireworks, for The Graduate\u00e2??s reputation has stemmed from its dramatic sexualisation of a down-to-earth coming-of-age story.\n \nWeirdly, The Graduate is considered one of the funniest American films of all time. I find it hard to consider The Graduate a comedy, as its sexually stimulated storyline appears more as a drama. It in no way can be considered a comedy because if you classify a post-studying-life crisis resulting in a sexual affair with a married, alcoholic woman, and then her child, then the comedy genre it seems knows no boundaries and can be anything. The Graduate may force a giggle on a few occasions but the film features far more of other genres to be classified as a comedy. It is more of a combination of eroticism and drama, or better yet an erotic drama that shows Fifty Shades of Grey how to be sexual, yet meaningful in its depictions. From the inceptive seduction of Benjamin at Mrs Robinson\u00e2??s home, to their inhabitation of hotel after hotel, this sexual affair is your typical affair in today\u00e2??s world, but back then this was adulterously spicy, and that is the essence of what made The Graduate so special. The famous scene where Bancroft places just her leg in the shot and puts on tights ever so sensually with a hapless Hoffman in the background aroused into paralysis, just like anyone watching, is so masterfully executed. Benjamin then moves onto Elaine, but this relationship is far more emotional than salacious providing a layer of drama to the eroticism. But, like the sensuality, the matriarch of the Robinsons pretty much causes drama whenever she is on screen. Without Mrs Robinson, I\u00e2??m afraid The Graduate would lose all its charm for her personality is histrionic, her age difference to Benjamin\u00e2??s is scandalous and the way she develops from the seductive temptress into a Havisham-like brute has melodrama written all over it!\n \nAnne Bancroft portrays the famous Mrs Robinson with such gravitas that The Graduate belongs to her. She will literally blow you away by her authoritative stubbornness and sexual prowess, which never fails to get her what she wants. She has such a powerfully resplendent aura that her performance fits the symbol of a middle-aged cougar so impressively. The lack of a first name shoots Mrs Robinson\u00e2??s appeal sky-high for her mysteriousness makes her seductively alluring. Dustin Hoffman stars as Benjamin Braddock, marking his first foray into acting. Braddock is such a creepy character as he for the first hour is almost paralysed in the same position, facially and physically. Hoffman captures the character so well because he has that underdog charisma to pull off being silently innocent for most of the film. He is so visibly discontent with life that Hoffman\u00e2??s awkwardly numb face fits the profile so well. Katharine Ross is Elaine Robinson, Benjamin\u00e2??s love interest. Ross may be the daughter in the family, and only nine years younger than Bancroft, but boy does Bancroft out-sex her daughter and become the fascination of many men.\n \nThese three actors are lucky, lucky people, for the amount of past and future Hollywood legends that were considered for or who wanted the roles is ridiculous. For the part of Mrs Robinson, names ranged from Joan Crawford, Lauren Bacall, Audrey Hepburn, Rita Hayworth and Judy Garland, whilst for Benjamin, Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall and Jack Nicholson were considered. The buck of names didn\u00e2??t stop there as Faye Dunaway, Shirley MacLaine, Sally Field and Jane Fonda were considered for Elaine. The shock is that some of these actors rejected the role, and some were so desperate to play a part that Ava Gardner called Nichols asking about the film. This goes to show how intriguing the characters were to Hollywood, and although some of the final choices are debatable, the characters are what remain fantastic.\n \nThe Graduate is creatively endowed as it drifts away from the notion of a coming-of-age story, thanks to its storyline\u00e2??s cleverness in making adulthood such a fun and exciting lifestyle where the only worry seems to be finding a woman to love. Just like Benjamin is drifting through life not knowing exactly what he is meant to be doing, the camera almost doesn\u00e2??t seem to know what to be doing, as it never interferes with the proceedings; it remains subjective and drifts ever so slowly through scenes. This works a treat as it amplifies the foreboding eroticism in order to intensify your fantasies, but this can also make The Graduate sort of undergraduate in intelligence, as it works to satisfy the story not the audience\u00e2??s interest. The Graduate can seriously be slow paced as Simon & Garfunkel\u00e2??s hypnotic soundtrack including songs such as \u00e2??The Sound of Silence\u00e2?? provides a deliberate sluggishness to represent the unravelling of Benjamin\u00e2??s purposeless life. But this doesn\u00e2??t put you off as this coming-of-age-through-sexual-adventures saga is just too intriguing. Hollywood was also facing restrictions as to what can possibly be shown on film in 1967, but The Graduate almost matured cinema as it did Benjamin.\n \nThe Academy Awards took this film seriously, proving again it is not a comedy, as it, despite winning only for Best Director, was nominated for Best Picture and three acting categories. It baffles me as to why Anne Bancroft did not win, but then again Katharine Hepburn, who won, is the most heavily awarded actor ever.\n \nThe Verdict:\n \nA salacious adventure that has melodramatically marked its place in cinematic history, for its coming-of-age story remains so effective almost half a century later. And that is predominantly Mrs Robinson\u00e2??s doing.\n \n\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??\u00e2??        8/10",

            "content": "Lessons on love.  So this is about a college graduate (Dustin Hoffman) who comes home, only to find his longtime neighbor, Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), vying for his affection.  When she forbids him from seeing her daughter (Katharine Ross), it sets the scene for a whole lot of jilted drama.  Some time has passed since the last time I had the opportunity to watch the hilarity that is The Graduate; it's a film that I have nothing but fond memories for, but for whatever reason, it never managed to find a way into my rotation of movies I rewatch on a regular basis.  As always, working my way through the list of 1,001 Movies You Must See Before You Die gives me a great excuse to revist the classics I otherwise wouldn't.  Regardless if you've ever had an affair with an older married woman, what makes The Graduate work is how relatable it is.  This is also what makes it so funny as well, and watching Hoffman get entangled in this tricky predicament leads to big laughs.  He's at the age where he can be confused about what he wants, and it is easy to see why he gets overwhelmed like he does, especially when there is a manipulative man-eater that has him in her sights.  It's his age and demeanor that make you buy into his character; with where he's at, there is an uncertainty about the future, and everybody wants to give him advice for this transition period of his life.  Given that these are close family friends doling it out, and given that he's a polite young man, he doesn't have really much of a choice here, other than to nod his head and listen.  For a comedy, The Graduate has some excellent direction, which is something that is rare to see within the genre.  It's so good that it even took home an Oscar for it.  On top of the direction and the wonderful performances (Mrs. Robinson is one of the all-time great tragic characters), everything is tied together by one of the most iconic soundtracks of all time, courtesy of Mr. Paul Simon and Mr. Art Garfunkel.  Every element about this is top notch, but I do have one qualm about it that holds it back from being a perfect film, for me at least: it hits a drag point right before the big finish.  It's only for a 10 minute period or so, and I think it is just because the play a reprise for the same song three times in a row, but I did notice it.  Still, the wedding finale more than makes up for it, and this is considered to be a classic for a reason.",

            "content": "First of all, The Graduate marks the 100th film I've logged in my first year of keeping track here on Letterboxd! So yay for that!\n\nFor years, I've seen The Graduate toted as a defining entry in film history. Obviously, I'm decades removed from experiencing its original effect. Now, looking back, I can't quite understand why the movie is so esteemed. Granted, it's a terrifically acted movie (in large part), the production design is stellar, and the dialogue is charming.\n\nIt all starts out well enough. There's a funny but pervasively melancholy tone. We're introduced to the premise: a recent (and depressed) college graduate starts an affair with his father's business partner's wife. We come to learn more about both Benjamin and Mrs. Robinson. There's a fantastic scene where the two talk, actually talk, for the first time. It's still a pretty twisted story, but it could have led to an interesting tale of two people figuring out their complicated situations.\n\nBut that all comes grinding to a halt when Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, enters the picture. Now, this isn't a bad development - it actually opens another interesting avenue of story possibilities. And for one scene there, Ben and Elaine's first date, things are working nicely. But from that point forward, the movie becomes unbelievably fake. I wasn't buying a relationship based off one date, I wasn't buying Mrs. Robinson turning into a one-dimensional psychotic, I wasn't buying Ben turning into a mildly disturbing stalker, and I wasn't buying Elaine losing all semblance of personality.\n\nAnd then the movie ends. Ben makes a definitive decision for the first time in his life. He is escaping with Elaine. But as the two make their retreat on the bus, looks of disappointment cross their faces. Given how off the rails the movie went, this is probably the best ending imaginable. It keeps things really introspective. In the subtlest of ways, it's not quite the happy ending we've been conditioned to expect.\n\nThe acting by Dustin Hoffman and Anne Banecroft is truly terrific! Hoffman's line delivery is the most impressive thing about the movie. And while Ben isn't honestly that interesting of a character, Hoffman make him likable, at very least. The relationship between Ben and Mrs. Robinson isn't as weird as it could be. In actuality, Hoffman was only six years younger than Banecroft at the time if filming. On that, Banecroft offers up some fantastic acting of her own. The scene where she discusses her personal past with Benjamin is truly outstanding stuff. But unfortunately, her character is tossed to the side without sufficient exploration. In her place, Katharine Ross flatlines through the movie as Elaine. The film fails to build up a compelling relationship between Ben and Elaine, and in turn, the latter character ultimately detracts from the story.\n\nOn an unrelated note, the songs by Simon & Garfunkel work wonders. They understand the movie implicitly and they enhance every scene they accompany.\n\nThe Graduate has its pros (wonderful acting, direction, production, music, etc), but it's not without a healthy list of flaws (extremely disappointing second half, complete disregard for a main character, etc). So, given its reputation, I would definitely attest that The Graduate is overrated. The more you think about it, the more it falls apart. The ending isn't bad, but the journey from the middle of the movie to the ending certainly is. Still, as an important piece of film history, and as half of a really good movie, there's enough interesting stuff here to warrant a muted but positive reaction.\n\n\"It's like I was playing some kind of game, but the rules don't make any sense to me. They're being made up by all the wrong people. I mean no one makes them up. They seem to make themselves up.\" 7/10",

            "content": "I understand the social commentary of The Graduate, and I can even relate to Ben's state of confusion after graduating college, but I can't say that the events following are appropriate enough given the context.\n\nThis film's biggest mistake isn't a mistake really at all. It is the fact that it's extremely dated. Perhaps The Graduate is historically significant, but it just doesn't hold up well at all. While deeply analyzing this film you can't deny that it's pretty smart, but that analysis must only come after understanding the perspective of the times--that is, the generation gap and the confusion of growing up in the '60s. And it's even unsure as to whether that acuity is intentional or not. The Graduate may have been relevant and sensible in 1967, but in this day and age it doesn't seem so. \n\nAnother fault, which is a bit more tangible, lies within the characters. Their rationales don't make much sense. The film is made up of a cacophony of decisions that should be labeled as farce, but are taken way too seriously to even be considered as such. Elaine has to be the most annoying character. While she isn't a terrible person, it doesn't make any sense why she's in love with Ben and why she's so understanding towards him after thinking that he raped her mother. And apparently Ben and Elaine are in love with each other after one date--and not even a very good one at that. There is no affable character in this entire film. They all make you feel uncomfortable. And I have a hard time enjoying a film that gives me nobody to like or sympathize with.\n\nThis is an example of a movie that isn't a sum of its parts. There are many good scenes, but together they don't add up to an enjoyable experience. It doesn't feel like a story so much as a series of events that don't fit together seamlessly. Although stylistically even, the tone seems to be unset. \n\nThere just simply isn't any redeeming value to this film whatsoever, and I can't say that I like it. Not to mention, he keeps driving on the Bay Bridge for no reason.\n\nTwizard Rating: 64",

And...it's obviously much superior to the book, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe book had virtually no imagery, no description, and pretty much no actual characterization going on. The reader was never actually aware of anyone's feelings except through dialogue. In movie form, we're able to see their expressions, and seeing it acted out makes it so much more interesting. I have to highly commend the acting - both Mrs. Robinson and (especially) Benjamin could be deeply unlikable characters, as they are in the book, but their actors give them depth, and, in Hoffman's case, an easy likability that makes it easier to ignore his many flaws and overall creepy attitude.\n\nAlso, the movie is way funnier. There are some lines that I read in the book/screenplay that I simply didn't recognize as funny then, but are borderline hilarious when watched on the screen. Hoffman's physicality was perfect for the role. Again, I have to stress that I hated his character in the book, and in the book the only character I found myself rooting for was Mr. Robinson. In the movie, though, it's easier to like him. Also: stylish directing, great editing, a good soundtrack, and nice cinematography all contribute to making the movie more enjoyable.\n\nThere are still some flaws. Like I said, Ben is pretty creepy at some points, and it's pretty ridiculous that he and Elaine are acting like they fell in love when they technically went on, what, one date? At least we got to see more of the date than in the book, and Katharine Ross's beauty makes his love for her a little easier to believe, but it's still hard to get TOO invested in that relationship without having seen much of it at all. Still, by the time Benjamin arrived at the wedding at the end, I was strangely invested, and as they ran out of the church together, Benjamin waving a cross around, I couldn't help but get caught up in the laughs and the thrills and root for them. This movie might have some of the same flaws the book did, but it works a hell of a lot better on screen with a great team of filmmakers.",

Dustin Hoffman is fantastic in the lead role. His nervous personality comes out perfectly and you find yourself rooting for him right till the end. Every character featured seems to have something to offer the film and adds to the enjoyment.\nThe music also plays a major part in the movie. The various Simon & Garfunkel songs placed over major scenes just adds to the general feel and emotions of the characters.

The coming-of-age part is a college graduate (Dustin Hoffman) doesn't know where to go in his life after graduating. The indirect part is the graduate's life gets into a peculiar direction where he was put under a spell and foolishly gets into an affair with a characteristically-lacked woman, who developed into a villainy of a sexual predator/witch to torture the graduate's life in that direction. The cause of that developing turn is when her daughter - with an opposite behavior of nice and an angel who can misunderstood things - gets into the picture and gave the graduate's more comfort in his life when he fell in love with the right girl. The direct and indirect ways blend in when he has to go against the forces of evil that was caused and infected by the woman's actions so he can show her daughter how much he loves her.\n\nThe direction started calmly, until the affair tensed it and exploded with a satisfying, uncompleted resolution that took a melodramatic scene to lead up to that moment. But the scene near to the end is a key moment of Dustin Hoffman's career when his character becomes a rebel with bravery to stop his love getting married to someone somewhat less than him.\n\nThis is one of Hoffman's best performances in the young phase of his acting career. His performance is the most praising next to the film's direction and nice usage of filmmaking techniques. And, to admit it, the performance of Anne Bancroft as the witch (even though I didn't care much about her winning performance).\n\n\"The Graduate\" is good, but there's some sort of nastiness within the sympathetic moments of what the graduate went through.

This choice to never stray far from either side of the theatrical mask is largely responsible for this classic's enduring appeal. However, it's far from its only success. Fans of Wes Anderson take notice: director Nichols edits and shoots with bold experimentation for this sort of dramedy; jump cutting in time, slow shifting camera focus, and long takes full of brilliant acting punctuate this fighting-to-come-of-age romance that flies past the conventions of its era to sit alongside the best that modern indie films offer.\nBen Braddock, a recent college graduate, returns home to find himself roped into an affair with older acquaintance Mrs. Robinson. We quickly realize that Ben is essentially a fish in an aquarium, with no control over any aspect of his life, as his dead-eyes blindly follow his parents, Mrs. Robinson, and society's expectations. Hoffman and Bancroft are of course phenomenal. Their characters couldn't be more different (Hoffman anxious and spineless, Bancroft cool and emotionally broken), yet they dance around each other with wit and uncomfortable believability. Tons of great moments and characters calmly ignite the screen, each filled with humor, awkwardness, and poignancy.\nOn top of being a fairly on-the-nose coming-of-age parable, the entire piece is a giant critique of anything and everything (coddled parenting, youthful cynicism, stodginess, frivolity, romance, attaining happiness, even the idea of ultimate purpose). It recognizes that making decisions, even wrong ones, is an important part of adulthood. Yet despite its skeptical view, warm characters and strict honesty have allowed it to age with as much grace as bite.",

Firstly, it illustrates how na\u00efve young people can easily be led astray by false promises of idle, fleeting bliss. Secondly, it illustrates the younger generation inevitably rebelling against the older generation, which was a prevalent cultural spectre back in the late 60's. The music helps to set the mood very well, to the point that certain scenes don't even need music, because the mood had already been set. The characters are neither good, nor bad.

The film has aged in ways that other films from the 1950s and 60s haven't. Regardless, the film is certainly influential. The film is depressing, however, it has a dosage of comedy (thank you Dustin Hoffman). The film is a film about broken down people. The older Mrs. Robinson seduces the graduate Benjamin. Caught up in despair and heartache. Mrs. Robinson (Bancroft) is normally manipulative and fierce towards Benjamin, however, you see brief glimpses of her mortality scattered throughout the film. The moment Benjamin reveals to her daughter about the affair, the moment she tries to call the police on Benjamin, and the huge fight at the end where she slaps her own daughter in a desperate attempt to keep her away from Ben. The scene of unhappily married Elaine and her rescuer Ben barricading the angry mob in the church is very symbolic of a time when old values were thrown off to be replaced by new ones, which usually are much worse than the old. The Judeo-Christian worldview was tragically thrown away to be replaced by a time of drug addiction, unhealthy sensual pleasures (it was nothing new but it became more common), and diseases from those pleasures and the numerous people they slept with. In fact, I think many were glad to enter the 80s and step out of the dreary, depressing 70s. The 60s were a time when great leaders like MLK and JFK were senselessly shot down. It was a time when a war in Vietnam brought unrest not only to Indochina but the United States as well. The peace movement swept in in opposition of the war and the war came to make less and less sense as it droned on. A sense of nostalgia is felt for a time like the 50s when things seemed simpler. Even as complex as the 50s were, they were not as complex as the decade that followed.",

Three Best Picture Oscar films, two Best Actor Oscars, and so many other accolades it would take three months time to name half. But slowly, as it is, Dustin Hoffman has become my favorite actor. His expressions, voice, ability to play different, memorable characters, and most of all his emotions range throughout every film he's in. As I watched All The Presidents Men, he was the only person I can think about that truly got me excited to see on screen. There's so much Hoffman to throw out to the world, and so many films to see him in, you can't help but appreciate how he has revolutionized acting in general. The Graduate is by far my favorite performances of his, also considering it's his first. Hoffman brought acting to a whole new level with his presence in film, with such movies as Rain Man, Midnight Cowboy, Kramer vs. Kramer and much more. When I saw Kramer vs. Kramer last year I knew Dustin Hoffman was a fine actor, and I stated in my review I was excited to see him in more movies. And as I did, I realized how likable he was, and mostly, how you could not help but root for him and remember him. Not many actors can do what he does, and as long as there's a Hoffman movie to watch, I'll be watching as much as I can.\r\n\r\n   The Graduate is a drama coming-of-age film directed by Mike Nichols and written by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry and is based on the novel of the same name. It stars Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katharine Ross. The acting in this film is phenomenal, well ahead of it's time especially when it was released in 1967. Dustin Hoffman gives the best breakout film performance of all time as the lead character of Benjamin Braddock. His use of inflection, nervousness, narcissism and immaturity make him a character most of us would not particularly like, but we can't help but cheer him on throughout the film. Anne Bancroft plays Mrs. Robinson, the woman whom Benjamin has an affair with. Her presence in the film is powerful and daunting, and the audience feels she is the clear villain throughout the course of the film. She uses Benjamin as a source of power and control, for throughout her life she never got any. But when her daughter Elaine, played by Katharine Ross, gets involved, Mrs. Robinson can't help but feel jealous and when Benjamin falls in love with Elaine things turn to chaos. Katharine Ross gives the weakest performance of the three, and while she does bring power and depth to the film, she portrays her character very much like Diane Keaton from Annie Hall. She was good, but I didn't like her very much and her acting was timid and insecure. Considering The Graduate was one of her first films, she did do well for a newcomer, but her apprehensive personality drew away from what could have been an excellent performance. Still, though, Hoffman and Bancroft push the movie to greatness as they both express clearly signs of insecurity and the need to be loved. Hoffman clearly expresses all the emotions any college student in the situation would feel, and I feel he deserved a Best Actor Oscar for this movie for it is arguably the greatest coming-of-age performances of all time. All the actors deserve multiple awards for this film, but that's also to thank for from the great direction and writing.\r\n\r\n   Mike Nichols directed this film and won the Oscar, and he deserves it quite a bit. During the seventies when films were starting to change and mean more than an entertainment medium, many directors became prevalent and mattered more to the film than anything else. Mike Nichols was early on the trend back in 1967, bringing more to The Graduate when it came to telling a story than had been done in the majority of films before it. Nichols shows the story through Braddock's eyes. As Braddock passes through a crowd of adults, Braddock, who feels he is still a kid, feels smaller than all of them  and doesn't understand what's going on. Nichols makes the viewer feel like that as he positions the camera low and makes the and volume irritate and confuse the viewer as it would Benjamin. As Benjamin feels his life slow down and become easier, so does the viewer feel that way. Nichols keen eye for making the audience understand and become the character is one I have not seen by any other director. Now, at times, when the film slowed it felt slow and it felt kind of dull. Benjamin also had these experiences as the film went on, but while I do appreciate Nichols made us feel like Benjamin at those time, it tended to get tiring, but rarely did this happen and the film went on, with my eyes glued to the screen the entire time. The film also takes on some conflicting moods though, and the majority of the time Nichols had solid direction, but when he did not it was different direction than before and felt misplaced. Still, Nichols brings the innocence, insecurity, and coming-of-age to Braddock and the viewer, engulfing them in scenario neither Braddock or the viewer could escape from. Whether Braddock actually comes-of-age is question to ponder due to ending of the film and is a long topic difficult to discuss in one review without spoiling the ending, so one day I will explore the themes of The Graduate in a separate blog. But I do want to say that writers Willingham and Henry make the themes relevant and while they aren't all clear to see, they are surely there. The dialogue, although forgettable, pulls these themes through the characters and keeps the audience entranced through the movie. There are many interpretations of many scenes throughout the course of the film, and most of them are different for varying people. It all ties the film together and makes the viewer think. It's a movie exploring themes relatable to almost anyone, and no many films have that gift with them.\r\n\r\n   The Graduate is a film about love, anger, naivity, power, rebelion, and most of all, maturity. The entire casts embodies confusion and unsatisfaction as the three leads discover each other and themselves. The writing brings out theme upon theme, each and everyone the audience can understand connect to. Nichols puts us in the shoes of Braddock as he undergoes his lifestyle change. He allows us to see what he sees, to hear what he hears, feel what he feels, and throughout most of the film he allows us to be Braddock. While Katharine Ross's performance and Nichols inconsistencies now and then take away from the film a little, it does not shatter its greatness. Most importantly, Dustin Hoffman proves without a doubt he is one of the greatest actors of all time with this movie. His emotions range from pure happiness to pure depression. He embodies not only the faults in all of us, but embodies our self pride and misunderstanding. Most of all, he embodies the change in us. Dustin Hoffman plays a character that shows up every other buildings roman persona, and makes Benjamin Braddock the pure example of a boy changing to a man. And even in the end of the film, we don't know whether he has actually changed, or gotten worse. And truly, Hoffman embodies that idea in every character he plays. We understand Braddock and root for him, yet we don't understand why. Hoffman helps us to understand that even the worst of people are likable, and what makes them better is someone liking them. No other actor is like him and no other actor can be like him. As Hoffman changed films so did Benjamin change himself. And as Benjamin changed himself, I watched him and changed with him. It's one of my favorite films of all time. 9/10.",

            "content": "This is the seminal romantic comedy/drama that forever redefined the genre, made a star of now-legendary actor Dustin Hoffman, and solidified director Mike Nichols as a directing force to be reckoned with both on the stage and behind the camera. The screenplay by Buck Henry was adapted from the 1963 novel of the same name by Charles Webb.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the Graduate is one is that most everyone familiar with classic Hollywood cinema knows about. It centers around recent college graduate Benjamin Braddock (Hoffman) who returns home to Los Angeles where his parents and just about everyone he's ever known are there to congratulate him on his various accolades, both educational and extracurricular. But despite this, there is an air of general confusion and dissatisfaction about Benjamin, who can't quite figure out what to do with himself next.\r\n\r\nWhile at his party, Benjamin retreats up to his bedroom to escape all the commotion, and up comes Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft), innocently asking where the bathroom is. Immediately you can sense that she has an ulterior motive, and Benjamin becomes increasingly aware of this as the scene changes to show Benjamin dropping Mrs. Robinson off in front of her house, to which she urges him to come in until she \"can get the lights turned on.\" After pouring him a drink and asking him what he thinks of her, Mrs. Robinson lures Benjamin up to the bedroom of  her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), locks the door and stands before him naked, offering herself to him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Robinson's proposal only serves to deepen his confusion, but Benjamin decides to go through with the affair anyways. During the night, both agree to leave their houses unnoticed and meet at a hotel room nearby. Of course, Benjamin's parents find out, and there is a great scene in which Benjamin's mother questions him while he's shaving. Upon hearing the words \"are you seeing somebody,\" he cuts himself with the razor, but simply responds that he goes out for drives.\r\n\r\nBesides seeing Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin passes the time floating around in his pool. Not too long into the affair however, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she doesn't want Benjamin to spend time with her daughter Elaine, for seemingly no reason at all. Interestingly, the film never explains why either, leaving the viewer to make guesses that can only be shots in the dark, because there are no scornful past histories that come to light from any of the Braddocks or the Robinsons that would cause Mrs. Robinson to forbid Benjamin from bonding with Elaine.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the reason, Benjamin decides to seek out Elaine wherever she goes, marking the second half of the film where things get serious rather quickly. This causes the story to slow down a bit, but  you get to see some great scenery all over California where the movie was shot, including Beverly Hills (the Robinson's house) and the campuses of both USC and UC Berkeley, the latter of which Elaine attends in the film. It picks up pace again at the film's finale (the last twenty minutes or so), with a frantic running scene to rival the one at the end of Fight Club (1999)! The cast and crew of the film even drew parallels to this film as the inverse of its coming of age story for people in their thirties, where there can be little to look forward to in life, and where possibilities grow increasingly fewer. At one time, studio executives even considered hiring Buck Henry to adapt that film from a novel as well.\r\n\r\nLastly, The Graduate's soundtrack is one of the most memorable in classic movie history. It's made up of fourteen tracks, eight of which are composed by the folk-rock duo Simon and Garfunkel, and the other six by Oscar and Grammy-award winner Dave Grusin. Several of the folk duo's songs are brief though, so each artist has about equal time. The songs \"The Sound of Silence,\" \"April Come She Will,\" and \"Scarborough Fair/Canticle\" are used prominently in the film, the first of which is used three times throughout. Not only are the songs beautifully written, but the lyrics also put Benjamin's psychological unrest to poetic form.\r\n\r\nThe Graduate is a perfect representation of the anxiety that comes with being at a time in your life where the possibilities seem almost endless, to the point where it scares you into making decisions that seem comfortable at the time, but cause serious consequences later on. Hoffman, Bancroft, and Ross received Oscar nominations for lead actor, lead actress, and supporting actress, respectively. Also nominated were the cinematography by Robert Surtees who would be Oscar nominated a total of sixteen times throughout his career, winning three (King Solomon's Mines (1950), The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), and Ben Hur (1959)), and Buck Henry for adapted screenplay. The film would only win one (much deserved) Oscar for Nichols's directing, but it did win two BAFTAs (Best Film and Best Editing for Sam O'Steen). Even without the all awards attention, the free-spirited ideas in The Graduate had been ingrained in popular culture and remain there to this day.",

Why would she come to him without much negative feelings believing he raped her mother? And then believing him just like that? Furthermore, there is really no good reason for them to get married. They can hardly have had more than 3 meaningful conversations since the beginning of the movie. And for Benjamin, he's not so much in love, as he is obsessed with an idea of a person. The \"post-college malaise\" which is referred to in the Critics Consensus, is hardly explored deeper than the depth of the family pool when its actually the depth of an ocean, figuratively speaking. It also seems to be one of the main reasons for Benjamin to get married.\nThe one character of whom I really would have wanted to know more about is Mrs. Robinson. She shows a deep, life like persona which sucks the audience in.

I inevitably went into it with some idea of what was going to happen, but little more than an expectation for Dustin Hoffman to pursue a relationship with an older woman, to the sound of Simon & Garfunkel.\n\nHoffman is Benjamin Braddock, the disaffected young university graduate who returns from his studies to a summer without direction. He is swiftly seduced by Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner, and embarks on a lengthy affair, but his affection soon turns to her daughter, Elaine. Yet this is merely the bare bones of the plot: it's more complex than a simple romantic comedy, and the ending, notably, is ambiguous.\n\nIt's impossible to complain about spoilers for a film that came out over forty years ago; it has seeped into popular culture, and been subjected to merciless parody. The iconic ending sequence is especially strange to watch for someone who grew up repeatedly watching Wayne's World 2 (1993), where it is replicated shot for shot.\n\nThe critical eye has been on the film for so long, and it has passed through so many generations that its contemporary relevance can be questioned. Though a product of the late 1960s, the counterculture elements we associate with the period, such as free love, psychedelia, or hard rock. Benjamin's sexual experiences are not part of a revolution, and he remains trapped firmly within the rigid framework of upper middle class suburbia.\n\nWhile there's a certain fascination to looking back on a snapshot of the past, many of us no longer have the same relationship with our parents and the older generation. Do we look back at a history of steady liberalisation, but no massive social upheaval, and see further subversion as unnecessary? Do our parents, the children of the past, simply provide us with a system we no longer need to escape? Maybe modern youth have it worse than Benjamin; our coming of age is not so straightforward. We are no longer afforded the opportunity of clear rebellion, and are left to wallow in the established structure.\n\nWhat does hold true is the portrayal of a graduate with no clear future, returning to inhabit the fading skeleton of a life that's somehow no longer his own, and the dull resignation that there's little incentive to do anything about it. As a graduate myself (Though my current social circle suffers an absence of attractive lonely women) I can largely sympathise with Benjamin's predicament.\n\nAfter all, what does the immediate future hold? The prospects of the graduate are numerous and varied. Will it be more of the same on a postgraduate course? Are we heading for the city for a mysterious role as an analyst or consultant (when we're really just brewing tea for executives)? Perhaps it's just going to be a couple more months playing video games in pyjamas before we make a final decision.\n\nWe still need something. A last hurrah before we're thrown to the world of work and responsibility for good. Could the modern rebellion be merely the fabled gap year abroad? At any rate, it seems coming of age requires something extreme, ditching the world and obligations, the way that Benjamin does at the end of The Graduate. The whole film is an exploration of these questions, symbolically relayed through the central relationships. The choices the characters make in their attachments are reflective of the choices that can be made in all facets of life.\n\nThis is emphasised stylistically through a number of visually captivating shots and transitions that underline the sense of emptiness and alienation. Water (swimming pools, aquariums, and rain) appears frequently as a tool of separation. The soundtrack contains little youthful euphoria, but is melancholic, featuring repeated motifs that again, accentuate loneliness.\n\nThese are played during moments that could otherwise be seen as positive steps in Benjamin's life, at the height of his relationship with Mrs. Robinson, and during his final elopement, elevating the drama above mere comedy.\n\nHis obsession with Elaine is far from romantic destiny, and exists primarily as an escape from his relationship with her mother, and a chance to give his life some purpose outside an unhealthy liaison that makes him feel increasingly trapped. Compared with Mrs. Robinson, Elaine's character is chronically underdeveloped, though she responds positively to Benjamin's pseudo-philosophical ramblings.\n\nWhile she is disgusted to learn of Benjamin's affair with her mother, we learn little else of her thoughts on home, and where she fits in do the loveless dynamic in the Robinson household. We do not know if she as desperate to break free as Benjamin is. She ultimately follows him on impulse, having initially been happy to marry another at her parents' request.\n\nThe separation from the character of Elaine forces us to experience the relationship purely from the perspective of Benjamin, who has put her on a pedestal and made her the object of his salvation.\n\nDespite the vein of sympathy I have as a fellow graduate, Benjamin is at times an insufferable and frustrating character to watch, and ultimately, Mrs. Robinson comes off as more sympathetic. She is the one who is truly lost and trapped. Benjamin still has his whole life ahead of him, once he finally decides what he's going to do with it.",

The story seems like it is going to be a coming-of-age romance then it turns into a romantic comedy with screwed up tendencies with Benjamin going after both Robinson girls.  Nominated for 7 Academy awards, including acting nods for Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katherine Ross, and winning the Oscar for director Mike Nichols, The Graduate is a movie that can be enjoyed several decades after its release.  It's actually hard for me to breakdown this movie any more than that because of the different genres this movie covers and the crazy nature of the story.  It will make you feel more different emotions than any other movie I can think of.  The ups and downs of The Graduate is well worth the viewing and deserves to be on the AFI list!  Co-starring Murray Hamilton, Norman Fell, Richard Dreyfuss, and William Daniels.\n\n8/10 Stars - Engaging, exciting and crazy - in a very good way!\n\nHer Review:  The Graduate is that iconic coming of age story taken to the extreme with a roller coaster of emotions to keep you hooked.  I have to say everything about this movie is pretty much screwed up, but then as a reflection of life seems only logical for it to be at least a little out of whack. With that being said it is that aspect of the film that pretty much makes it timeless.  Set and costumes aside this is definitely a movie that will be appreciated by generations yet to come.   I can't say I would ever put The Graduate in my personal top 100 but it certainly deserves a permanent spot on the AFI.  Now that I have given the movie its due, I am not sure how much more I can say.  The whole movie is intriguing and just well weird at times.  I think the thing I liked the least was the music.  Sure hearing the song once or twice is cool but the whole soundtrack sounds the same and it gets repetitive and annoying.  I am sure I am alone in saying that but well there it is. I am entitled to my opinion.  Everyone should see The Graduate at one point in their life to really understand what film and life in general are about.\n\n8/10 Stars - Down right nuts if you look too closely but a must see for any true film aficionado.",

            "content": "Were Martin Scorsese and Paul Shrader influenced by Mike Nichols' \"The Graduate\"? The scene in the club is similar to that of Travis Bickle taking Betsy in to a porn theater. That's as close to greatness does this film get. Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) is one of the most idiotic characters I've seen in film, somebody you have little pity for and are very much annoyed by; he is a bore. I couldn't care less for any of the parental figures, too. Braddock doesn't know what to do with his life; I find it hard to believe that he actually did something stellar in college. He has an affair with Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and then falls in love with her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross). I understand to a certain extent why the married woman seduces Braddock but I have no idea why her daughter found him attractive. It also happens very quickly, there wasn't much development on either side. The whole situation is silly, so is what Elaine thinks took place between her mother and Benjamin and how quickly the situation is reconciled, how quickly there is a separation and those that have seen the film know what happens in the end. \nLet us forget logic and not worry about its flaws, even if I view the film straight on it's not such a valiant effort. I do not hate it; it has some unique qualities, especially its point-of-view shots, the cinematography in general. It has a strange atmosphere which I definitely liked. Anne Bancroft actually gives a better performance than Dustin Hoffman for the most part. Hoffman is a terrific actor but I haven't seen him in a great film thus far. I believe this is what hampers him; he didn't have a great character or screenplay to work with. I haven't seen a performance from him that can be up there with Travis Bickle or Michael Corleone; incredible characters performed by incredible actors (in great films), not one or the other. People in \"The Graduate\" are mainly sketches, not real; I didn't comprehend the reasons behind their doings. The music score is appealing and how it works in the very last scene. I can why many people love the film so much but it has too many shortcomings to be great, like Hoffman's \"Midnight Cowboy\" and \"Papillon.\"",

It has the look of an ending that would be considered \"happy\", kind of like \"Good Will Huntings\" ending but it's really not due to the underlying themes of alienation, social pressures, generation gaps, etc. We see the two characters making a huge decision for their lives in a rushed manner, and in fact, the whole last quarter felt rushed, but it works in a sense, with the way the theme of the movie which is that social pressures and the generation gaps has made the adults want their children to make decisions and right away without aiming to truly live a proper experience. \"Plastics\" is said by a man about the life of today and it very much represents the superficial and not humane nature of people back then and today. The fact that this movie came out in 1967 is pretty amazing as it has many scenes that never felt like they were from a movie back then and the relevance stand strong, even today. I can very much see the major influences this movie has provided to films that came out afterwords and it is essentially, the first true \"coming of age\" film of it's time, and it's all done in a very scary manner then anything. All throughout the movie we see the main character, a young college graduate being forced to make life choices he just isn't sure about. First to have to talk to so many people when he is just so introverted, to go to graduate school by his parents, to get a job by relatives, then to have sex and in a sense, laughed at for not doing so before, by Mrs.Robinson, than to go on a date with a girl he hardly knows, etc. These adults feel their life is the best life and that to be happy, their children must do it as well, but it's very noticeable that their life is quite bland and lifeless, due to them following the system and not choosing the life THEY want. All of those pressures and what not, lead to a last quarter that is very rushed including the female making a choice she doesn't even truly want but does so anyways, but it makes sense, due to the theme of life being rushed for these people, and it ends off with the characters unsure if they even made a good choice of running away from all that stuff. What will they do now with their lives? It's very tragic and true. Life is not supposed to be a bunch of events to gain praise. If one wants that, then OK, but not everyone wants such. Never the less, in a sense, the ending is happy for the male lead as he has finally been able to do something \"different\" from everyone else...but now can he handle the typical family life ahead of him? Is this life REALLY what the female wants? The music is used very well and there are some truly iconic scenes such as the one with the main character in a swimming pool, drowning himself from everything...still as a tree...reminds me of that one scene in Wes Andersons \"Rushmore\". Another thing I really dug is the way the camera allows us to view life through the lens of the main male lead, with glances at the table and not the other persons face, and much more. There is more to be said, but The Graduate, overall, is a very good movie. I feel I will actually like it more with a re-watch some day. It's message hits hard and will continue to do so even in 2050. The Graduate is indeed, a classic.",

The scene when Elaine finds out, and you see her mum, in a corner, looking like death has become her, completely different to how the audience has previously seen her as the attractive, confident mother, is truly horrible. Benjamin is quite like Holden Caulfield in the way that he doesn't know what to do with his life, but we know he's not ill-intentioned, just confused.

As far as the dated  aspect of this film goes I felt that it was off of the very little amount of sympathy  I felt for the Benjamin character to the point that I was getting frustrated and thought to myself he deserved not to come out on top at the end. By the end I do question after everything he put her through why would Elaine still want to be with him. This is dated to me because when this film first came out this was looked more as a comedy rather then a drama, this all comes from the change in cinema. So in a way i cant really blame the movie at all for not 100% standing the test of time because most movies cant. I love that this movie can still have have a different meaning then it was originally intended and to me that actually makes it timeless rather then dated. Also the movie again kept my attention and even though i didn't completely like the Benjamin character I still felt happy at the end mainly because of the soundtrack and perfect timing of the direction.",

She was likeable because she was so mean and snotty to both Benjamin and her daughter. Sadly, I felt that Dustin Hoffman was very boring in his performance as the titular character. He just didn't do anything for me. I felt that his performance was forced and not smooth and natural. That's just me. \n\nOn the other hand, Mike Nichols' directing was mesmerizing. There are quite a few shots that I really enjoyed; for example, the reflection shot off the bar table is very good. Also, when Benjamin goes to see Elaine at Berkeley College, the far distance shots are very good, and the way it zooms in on Ben is very stunning for its time. \n\nI thought that this movie has a fairly entertaining plot, but Dustin Hoffman ruins it for me. He's too boring and monotone. However, I do completely understand the message and satire on the age gap that it's portraying, but it doesn't aid the fact that it is boring.

Along with its good writing this film was one of the forerunners in using popular music in its soundtrack. Starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katherine Ross with direction by Mike Nichols, the film opens with Benjamin Braddock returning home from college. He has excelled in many ways and yet he feels bored and alienated from his parents. However the naive Benjamin soon finds himself in an affair with an older woman. This further confuses him as he figures out what to do with his life. His unknowing parents want him to date a girl attending Berkeley. Things become complicated since it turns out to be Mrs. Robinson's daughter. Not wanting anything to happen between Benjamin and Elaine, Mrs. Robinson sabotages the relationship and tries to marry her daughter off while her own marriage goes down the tube. Benjamin who is ultimately in love with Elaine crashes the wedding and takes her away to face an unknown life ahead. With the help of a memorable Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, this film ushered in a new age geared toward the younger generations.",

Hoffman's character is thin, moronic & devoid of any really interesting parts. His younger Miss Robinson is even worse. \r\n\r\nI liked the Graduate, it's a film that soared with success when it was released but just doesn't fair as well with the passage of time. Of course you could say that about any film. All films age, they were made in a time & space that has come & gone. With that passing of time some movies age well & their themes & messages stay vital while others seem somehow trapped in their time & moment. Perhaps the Graduate, at least in some way falls into the latter category. \r\n\r\nThe memorable music by Simon & Garfunkel is fantastic in many ways & I cannot imagine this movie would be as successful if those classic songs & musical moments were absent from the film. \r\n\r\nThe screen play begins as a comedy but evolves or devolves to a drama with serious plausibility issues. The Graduate has some inspired transitions and a real charm at times. At others it just seems as though its lost its way somewhat.

On a technical aspect, this movie is fantastic as well. The acting is solid and Mike Nichols' direction is on-point. His decision to have sound from the next scene start towards the end of the current one gives the feeling that every menial task blurs together. This is a film very much worthy of its status as a classic.",

            "content": "I suspect this film was more relevant at the time than it is now. While I could still appreciate much of the plot the post-graduation malaise has been done on film so many times now as to be a positive cliche. In addition the cultural quirks of the '60s seem a lot less innocent than they did then. Mrs. Robinson's unhappy marriage earns her no pathos and she quickly becomes a complete monster to a discomfortingly unnuanced degree. And Dustin Hoffman's stalking of the young Ms. Robinson seems less sweet and more the act of a deranged maniac. Nonetheless, the cinematography is good, with the famous under the knee shot a standout along with the opening credits played over a moving walkway and the underwater scenes. The music's great too. And you can see why Hoffman was so acclaimed for this role since it really is a good performance. Just make sure you go in with your cultural preconceptions set to off.",

Ross and Hoffman are delightfully naive as Elaine and Benjamin and Anne Bancroft portrays the troubled Mrs. Robinson phenomenally. The Graduate comes complete with beautiful French New Wave cinematography and wonderful music from Simon and Garfunkel.",
