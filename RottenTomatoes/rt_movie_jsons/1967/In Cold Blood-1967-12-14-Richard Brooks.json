Despite a distracting and cloying jazz score that mars the first half of the film, In Cold Blood is a powerful indictment of America's barbaric crime and punishment issue.  The movie features strong performances from Wilson and Blake, both of whom give their heinous characters a sense of humanity.  Bolstered by stark black and white cinematography, In Cold Blood will no doubt spark debate regarding both the root cause of crime and the perceived value of capital punishment.",

            "content": "While the film attempts to make some sort of statement of the random nature of violent crime and the circumstances that might lead an otherwise relatively normal individual to commit a terrible act, to me it feels lopsided, focusing too much on the murderers rather than the brutality and seemingly arbitrary nature of the Clutter's murder, and throwing in vague thriller elements from the perspective of law enforcement that actually take away from the rest of the film. Confining the perspective to the victims and perpetrators, only referring to the authorities as a sort of divine or alien third party, would have elevated the tension and the quality of the film overall, especially given how convincing both Blake and Wilson are in their respective roles. Oftentimes the film just feels too overt in its musings, as when two random detectives witnessing the final executions, one young and idealistic, the other a jaded veteran, debate on the pointless nature of the murders and the executions. While this novel take on the noir may not be to everybody's particular tastes, the cinematography and performances each speak for themselves. (3.5/5)",

Richard Brooks's adaptation of Truman Capote's legendary \"non-fiction novel\" of the same name, \"In Cold Blood\" \u2014 if nothing else \u2014 successfully performs one of the more dangerous high-wire acts I've seen a movie try to pull off in quite a while. This is a movie that forces you to not only identify with those who have unspeakable crimes committed against them, but the individuals who commit said crimes. It's a gamble, but in the end, I found myself watching the movie's final moments with a quickened pulse and whitened knuckles. Why? Could it be the cinematography? The commendable acting and dialogue? Or could it be that, in depicting every event with such docudramatic flair, Brooks and Co. really, truly succeed in making you feel like an accomplice to the whole thing? Either way, \"In Cold Blood's\" final moments will forever haunt me. Time for a shower.",

The material with Scott Wilson and Robert Blake is astonishing.  When the film turns to the police and the press, it feels stodgy and old fashioned ... and has a 1960's preoccupation with psychology as the explanation for everything.  Visually it's a masterpiece.  Conrad Hall's B&W cinematography is some of the best ever done.",

It was chosen to be shot in black and white to focus more on the emotional content rather than the visual extravagance though this seems to have an unexpected result that makes the film visually mesmerizing for its time and through out today's standards, it makes me think it may have inspired some of the filming aspects of sin city. All of the actors in this movie brought their A game and are very memorable Robert Blake,\nScott Wilson, John Forsythe and Paul Stewart are all worth mentioning no actor is worth narrowing out though because they all delivered their characters most grandly. Any film critic who believes the film deserves anything less than a 90% is just insulting this master peice and should reevaluate their career choice, with that being said if you ever get the chance to watch In Cold Blood I highly recommend it for you will not find many films that captures it's over all execution of film making.",

It's extremely heavy going and honest for it's day, and it's amazing a film like this was allowed back in 1967. In November 1959, Perry Smith (Robert Blake) and Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson) come up with a plan to rob the home of Herbert Clutter (John McLiam) in Holcomb, Kansas, who is apparantly loaded with money. However, the robbery goes wrong, with Clutter and his wife and two children ending up being murdered in the process. Smith and Hickock go on the run, first to Las Vegas, then they head south and cross the border into Mexico. They're able to stay one step ahead of the law, led by Kansas FBI Chief Alvin Dewey (John Forsythe), who is determined to bring Smith and Hickock to justice, and it's not long before their money starts to run out. It was a murder that shocked America at the time, and it was a matter of time before it would become a film. It makes a good film too with some very good performances to boot, and it almost has a a New Wave feel with it's black and white photography, and it showcases what a good director Brooks was, and his work is in need of another look.",

The film follows the book as closely as you could reasonably expect, while also adding a great deal of cinematic style. While the film isn't usually regarded as a film noir, being based on a true story and everything, it is actually one of the best examples of film noir ever made, at least on a visual level. The cinematography by Conrad L. Hall features some of the best, starkest, most moody black-and-white photography in any movie, ever. The performances generally feel true to life; it's especially interesting now to watch a young Scott Wilson, whom we now know as the old man Hershel on The Walking Dead, play the cocksure Dick.

So the lighting design for these moments had to be perfect, casting shadows in all the right places and showing half a face at just the right time. Also, since it was in black and white the shadows were more important, i think, than if it had been in color. It's only grayscale, so the amount of black and where it falls on the characters, props and background emphasizes everything much more.\n\nThe lighting choices of this film helped bring that eerie feel, especially late at night when the duo is rummaging through the Clutter's house and proceed to kill them. The scene needed to be dimly lit with perfectly cast shadows, and I think the choices were strong and well played. The lighting aspect that struck me most was near the end when Perry was talking to the journalist and about to be hung. He was standing next to a window and it was raining, and with the perfect lighting from outside it projected images of the raindrops rolling down the window onto his face. It looked like he was crying. It was a stirring image that emphasized the moment so much more, a reflection on his past and his regrets. There were multiple times in the film where I loved the lighting and the effect it gave, but this moment was the most brilliant. This was a strong, solid movie and I enjoyed every bit of it.",

It's not just chilling, but also incredibly realistic. Conard Hall's Black and White Cinematography gave a stunning look to the film. Brooks direction and a smart screenplay takes us directly inside the head of the criminals who pulled the trigger. The fact is that we see the whole film through their eyes and although it seem weird that only these two killers are given the emotional weight, but that's not what it looks like. Brooks takes us to the dark side of Human Nature and this attempts takes us too deep. \n\nIn Cold Blood is lengthy, a little slow and they stretch the story a little bit, otherwise it would have received a perfect score from me. Nevertheless, this film always works in giving you chills and the story, though you might have heard it countless times, is given a more dark look. This is a good film if you want to have a thrilling weekend, but again this is just my personal opinion. Highly Recommended.",

At times, Brooks seems to be over-sympathizing and romanticizing these two killers, but based on this film as well as the equally phenomenal \"Capote\", it seems like the Perry Smith character (in this case played by Robert Blake) had a heart and was truly sorry for his heinous act of violence. Definitely a little dated, but still a shocking study that remains gritty and arresting throughout. Blake and Scott Wilson (now of \"The Walking Dead\" fame) are utterly fantastic in their respected roles. A movie that definitely should be seen.

            "content": "The biggest mistake I made in finally watching the classic IN COLD BLOOD was watching it within hours of finishing the book, thus turning what I knew was a highly-praised crime thriller from the late 60s into yet another example in the classic story of \"the movie never lives up to the book.\"  So my first inclination was to basically dismiss the movie.  I wasn't sure that it had anything to offer someone who read the book, so faithful as it is to Truman Capote's masterpiece.\r\n\r\nFor this movie, I thought I'd play a game of \"three up, three down.\"  Here are the three main reasons why the movie IN COLD BLOOD is worth your time, folowed by three reasons why it just can't measure up to the book:\r\n\r\n1.  Conrad Hall's cinematography.  His name was the first that jumped out as I began watching...the master who passed away after the one-two punch of \"American Beauty\" and \"Road to Perdition\" after a long list of Oscar-nominated work behind the camera.  The scene where rain on a window reflects on Robert Blake's face as tears is something that even non-cinemaphiles would notice.  \r\n\r\n2.  Robert Blake and Scott Wilson.  Both men just LOOK like your vision of Perry and Dick when you read Capote's book.  They are pathetic enough, yet handsome enough.  Obscure enough, yet wild enough.  They're pitch perfect.  Maybe one of the reasons why I thought the film wasn't adding anything to the experience was because these two were almost exactly what I had created in my head for these killers. \r\n\r\n3.  The Clutter family house.  I did not know this when I was watching, but I found out that they filmed this movie in the actual house where the Clutter family was murdered.  How creepy!  That instantly made me appreciate the film more.  You'd never get permission to do something like that today!  Robert Blake said that it was important to not be \"too Hollywood\" about the film by making it somewhere else.  To be watching and know that the place where the actors were tied up and killed was actually where it happened gives one a chill that few crime movies can muster.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fairness, here are three reasons why the film falls short of greatness:\r\n\r\n1.  A voice-over/narrator comes in toward the end.  I think it's supposed to be like the voice of Capote.  It's not needed.  It sends the film off in a different direction than it was going.  And it's out of joint with everything else.  I took that as a sign of weakness in tidying up the film that the director felt that was needed.  It complicated what was otherwise a sparsely-told and filmed story.\r\n\r\n2.  That age old problem of pared-down character development from page to screen causes us to lose a lot of the complexity of the two men.  I know this is to be expected, but it is at the expense of things like Dick's pedophelia and Perry's old Army buddy, who tries to remain his friend.  \r\n\r\n3.  I didn't feel like there was a lot of artistry in the translation, short of moments of Hall's camera brilliance.  With the exception of the trick of Perry seeing his father's face in others (a way of stylizing for the audience the notion that Perry comes from a violent past), everything else in the film is as literally lifted from the book as possible.  Consequently, once you've read the book, there's less of a reason to watch the film.  There's not much of a creative spin put on the material.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in the virtual skipping over of the court proceedings, one of the best sections of the book.  And I was also miffed by the toning down of racial prejudice from book to film, but I suspect that was the sacrifice made in 1967 to get it made.  Having said that, I give IN COLD BLOOD a qualified thumbs-up as a classic film worth seeing.  But nowhere near as good as the Truman Capote book!",

It is expertly crafted, a film that so slowly but so steadily increases in emotional and psychological tension until it erupts in the gruesome finale, which, in fact, sent a shiver through my body and practically rendered me speechless. The actors portraying Perry Smith and Dick Hickock (Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, respectively) are a perfect fit, more so than the actors portraying them in \"Capote\" or in the television adaptation of \"In Cold Blood\". They get consistently better throughout the film, as depth is brought to them. As for the direction, I am not all that familiar with the work of Richard Brooks but I am well aware that he is a great director. Here he does an excellent job captivating the dark and dreary Capote novel and transferring it to the big screen. But besides being well-acted and well-directed, \"In Cold Blood\" is a visually captivating film. How it didn't take home the Oscar for Cinematography or even a nomination for Editing is beyond me. One of the main reasons for my liking of this film was because of its striking visuals. For being almost 45 years old, it certainly is a visual achievement.",

            "content": "Unlike the film Gangs of New York, which adapted a spell-binding text and rendered it into conventional Hollywood tripe, In Cold Blood enhances the true crime novel by Truman Capote and brings it to life on the silver screen. The events which permanently altered life in tiny Holcomb, Kansas - and perhaps throughout all small towns in the United States - have been the subject of a true crime novel by Truman Capote, a documentary, television movie and the first widely-distributed American film to use profanity.\r\n\r\nCapote devoted six years to the project, compiling records and minutiae in order to uncover why Perry Smith and Dick Hickock murdered four members of the Clutter family during a botched robbery. Some claim that the book was the first non-fiction work to investigate a crime so thoroughly; others feel that Capote altered details and fabricated facts to suit his purposes.\r\n\r\nThe film is more succinct and streamlined, there are brief cameos by the criminals\u00e2(TM) families but it lacks the meticulous personal histories which help explain the motives behind a seemingly senseless crime. The combination of personal interviews, court documents and parole hearing testimonies reproduced in the book leaves the reader almost sympathetic towards the murderers and the difficult lives they have experienced. Several times during the film, a character may say that \u00e2individually they were hopeless but together they formed some sort of evil sentience\u00e2\u009d (or words to that effect) but the shallow reasoning does complete the puzzle of why this crime occurred in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe crime was subject to national media attention because of its seemingly futile nature. A family was killed for the sum of forty-three dollars, a radio and a set of binoculars. Capote chose to investigate the story further because it represented an attack on traditional values by unknown individuals; the Clutters could have stood in for any family in the country. Hence the major shortcoming of the film: readers know that the murders were the culmination of a lifetime of frustration but viewers only receive the Reader\u00e2(TM)s Digest version.\r\n\r\nStill, the film includes hallmarks of film noir, such as the chaotic jazz score and the grainy black and white footage. The first part of the book establishes how Smith and Hickock are moving inexorably towards the Clutter family -- although they seem to be exact opposites, fate has decided that they are destined to collide. Director Richard Brooks employs jump cuts to establish the parallel between the perpetrators and their victims.\r\n\r\nFate plays a central role in the story as there are numerous chances for the crime to be averted or the criminals to escape persecution. Yet the crime and its aftermath are unavoidable. Often, a bird\u00e2(TM)s eye view follows Smith and Hickock in their car, providing the audience with extra information of which the drifters are not yet aware. Brooks chose to film in black and white, perhaps echoing the news coverage of the event and also signaling that the crime cut short a more innocent time period.\r\n\r\nThe film and the book develop very slowly. We know what has happened but we do not learn the details until later. The climax, a flashback of the murders, is not a surprise but it remains suspenseful nonetheless. The deliberate pace may not suit today\u00e2(TM)s audiences although it is more realistic portray of the crime and subsequent pursuit. Studying the characters becomes as enthralling as watching action sequnces.",

It tells the story of the crime, their capture, and their execution.  It is based on the classic non-fiction novel by Truman Capote, his story has also been made into a movie starring Philip Seymour Hoffman (earning him a Oscar), called \"Capote\".  \n\nI usually don't care much for films with heavy social commentary but it doesn't take anything away from this movie.  While this film hasn't changed my mind about the death penalty, this movie (and I presume the book) make a very strong case against it, without being overly self righteous and annoying as so many other films have, \"Dead Man Walking\", and \"The Life of David Gale\" come to mind.",

Featuring outstanding acting, superb direction, and black-and-white cinematography that can only be described as sublime, In Cold Blood takes us into the heart of senseless violence while simultaneously taking us on a ride through the illogical structure of the American justice system.  Like Capote's novel, the film neither exonerates nor condemns the two killers, but it does take time to demonstrate the many idiosyncratic, inexplicable aspects of the penal system.  While the film never quite evoked the horrors that novel did--probably because it doesn't depict them--it is still a harrowingly realistic portrayal of murder and its punishment.  A powerful exploration of the killer's mind and environment that produces a killer, In Cold Blood was way ahead of its time and remains an American classic.",

What he brought back was the timeless novel In Cold Blood, telling that story and the stories of the two young men that were going to the gallows for that crime.\n\n \n\nI've never read the source material, but I've seen both adaptations of Capote actually researching the novel (Capote with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Infamous with Toby Jones). Both docudramas are powerful pieces in their own right, but it's this film that is a masterpiece. It stars Robert Blake as Perry and Scott Wilson as Dick. These guys have both been to prison, each of them with dreams to follow. The thing about dreams is they need working capital, like a business. So in the dead of the night they follow a prison tale of a farmer and his safe, driving to the rural Kansas home. The next morning the family is dead. No safe. No money. No dreams.\n\n\nWe continue to follow the pair as the haphazardly make their way to Mexico for a little bit, but they come back because those dreams are so damn good. The inevitable happens. They make the mistake and Lady Justice takes over.\n\n \n\nBefore this film there were movies that followed the antagonists point of view, but In Cold Blood makes you sympathize with these two young murderers or in the very least Perry. Here's two men that slaughtered an entire family in their own home and we feel pity for them. They're lifetime losers and this was where the road they shared was heading for a long, long time. They were ticking time bombs. They were two chemicals that mixed together and tragedy followed. \n\n\nThe movie is filmed as bleakly as the characters it shows us. Black and white in 1967 was very rare, but for this film it works for an added effect that would later be used by Scorsese in raging Bull and Spielberg in Schindler's List.There is no color because this life is colorless. There are no bright spots. Darkness is at the end of that tunnel, not that great light that everyone is talking about. This is a very beautiful film from director Richard Brooks.\n\n \n\nThis is one of those wonderful gems from the late 1960's that teetered between the old Hollywood and the new. This was before the ratings system, so hearing the word \"bullshit\" was an awe inspiring experience (this is the first Hollywood production that used it). In Cold Blood is a groundbreaking film that broke new ground and even though it didn't quite open the door for those great films of the 1970's we can say that it turned the latched and cracked it open a bit. This is one of the great films of the '60's.",

Having seen Capote and read In Cold Blood, I can easily say that this film did the book justice (Capote was released after this one as you all know). This film was fantastic. I really liked the use of black and white filming. It gave the film a...well, I'm not sure how to describe it, but this film would not have worked nearly as well if it was in color. I liked the two lead actors as well. I feel that they effectivley carried the film and captured the personalities of the two killers. I would highly suggest this film to anyone. It is a fantastic film. \r\n\r\n\r\nTRIVIA TIME: 1. To get the authenticity he wanted, Richard Brooks  filmed in all the actual locations including the Clutter house (where the murders took place) and the actual courtroom (6 of the actual jurors were used). Even Nancy Clutter's horse Babe was used in a few scenes. The actual gallows at the Kansas State Penitentiary were used for filming the executions, however, in a 2002 interview, Charles McAtee (who was State Corrections Director for Kansas in the 1960's), clarified the hangman in the film was an actor, not the real deal. \r\n\r\n2. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson were not the first choices to play the cold-blooded murderers. Studio heads at Columbia Pictures originally wanted Paul Newman and Steve McQueen in the lead roles. Newman chose instead to star in Cool Hand Luke and Hombre that year; McQueen worked on The Thomas Crown Affair and Bullitt. \r\n\r\n3. The two pairs of eyes pictured on the movie poster are those of the real killers, not the actors portraying them.

All in all, this is a great classic featuring excellent performances from its cast.  I recommend it.",

Then, the film follows there crooked ways, with the acts of passing bum cheques, until they are finally captured by the authorities. Though no blood is actually shown, you can picture the grisly scenes of murder as the crime is committed. What an ugly and disturbingly good film.

It shows the fierce attachment between two desperate men (Robert Blake's tragic schlub Perry Smith and Scott Wilson's chillingly charming Dick Hickox), the vagaries of legal investigation (the FBI did not approve the script, so the body of authority is the fictional \"Kansas Bureau of Investigation), and the futility of imprisonment. While we dislike the protagonists on principle, we cannot help but be compelled by their story, which plays before us in beautifully grainy black and white.",

            "content": "If any movie could be called a neo-noir, it's Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capote's groundbreaking novel \"In Cold Blood\", based on the murder of the Clutter family in Kansas in 1959. Like film noir, the movie has a dark visual look and even darker subject matter to go with it, but unlike noir, the mystery surrounding the crime is not \"who?\" or \"what?\", but \"why?\". Few crime films have ever managed to make that question so overbearing and relevant has this one, and Brooks achieves it by keeping the focus on the two criminals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 brought to life with astonishing humanity by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson \u00e2\u0080\u0093 before and after their notorious act. Instead of showing us the graphic staging of the murders early in the film when they would chronologically occur, Brooks instead cuts directly to the discovery of the bodies the morning after (as chilling a scene as you ever will see) and saves the killings as the climax, having allowed the audience to explore the psyches of the killers after committing the deed. This simple but ingenious restructuring of the book's narrative flow may not make it any easier to accept the senselessness of such violence (nor should it), but it does bring us a bit closer to understanding that enigmatic question of \"why?\". \"In Cold Blood\" is all the more hair-raising for its stark realism, shot in news reel black-and-white by the brilliant Conrad L. Hall.",

Both of the leads do a great job of portraying their characters but it is Robert Blake that shines through his sympathetic portrayal of Perry Smith. The b&w cinematography is amazing. Each shadow cast on the characters' faces so great. Unfortunately the great Conrad Hall didn't win the Oscar that year, it going instead to Bonnie and Clyde which did deserve it as well. Quincy Jones' jazzy score highly supports what is going on the screen and during the opening credits together with the beautiful b&w cinematography makes it feel as if you're watching some kind of film noir. Also the editing is fantastic the way it juxtaposes some shots with others back to back. In my opinion it was also robbed of an Oscar nomination for that category.\nIn Cold Blood is certainly one of the best adaptations and one of the greatest films of all time and very much important.

            "content": "On November 15, 1959, a peaceable farmer, his wife, and his son and daughter were murdered in the sleepy whistle stop town of Holcomb, Kansas. As homicide goes the Clutter case was particularly gruesome-- a 12 gauge shotgun was the principal murder weapon.\r\n\r\nIt was the stuff of sober radio broadcasts, grim TV reporters, sensational headlines, and bestselling tell all nonfiction accounts. The latter, IN COLD BLOOD, was the work of journalist-cum-author Truman Capote, who penned a chilling, if verbose, account of the tragedy. What might have been a \"mmm, that's terrible\" of a Sunday morning's paper was instead immortalized, ostensibly forever. \r\n\r\nI read (or rather, heard) the novel on a long Christmas car ride-- not exactly the merriest entertainment, but nonetheless riveting. Painstakingly describing anything with any connection at all to the murder, Capote paints a vivid picture indeed. Naturally, I wanted to see how his portrait of the tragedy matched up with the monochrome filmic one.\r\n\r\nThe first thing, surprisingly, that I got to thinking of as IN COLD BLOOD started was the sound of it. The film begins with a jazz number, all trombones chuffing and rhythmic thumps and pulses, and intercut-- can I say, masterfully?-- with the squeals of a bus and a train's shriek. \r\n\r\nWe see a jumble of images and a loose thread of a plot starts to develop-- one man, Perry (on the cover the one in the foreground, also the one most focused on in the movie) has gotten out of jail and, from his feverish uneasiness and too-rapid movements, is expecting to meet someone. One collect call later, hopes are dashed and plans are set anew. \r\n\r\nPlans, it turns out, that will be the undoing of six lives-- two guilty, four innocent. Perry meets a guy he knew, briefly, behind bars, in anticipation of a newly minted stratagem. The perfect score, buddy Dick assures his worry-prone companion, with an emphasis on the words \"no witnesses.\" \r\n\r\nBehind the camera is a no name director, Richard Brooks, who's entirely credible filmography reveals a number of stage and screen adaptions and tersely written melodramas-- chief among them being the high school classic BLACKBOARD JUNGLE and sizzling Newman vehicle CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF. For a novel adaption, Brooks proves himself a ballsy guy in the direction department. There are plenty of interesting angles and fast edit flourishes, enough to keep the armchair cinematographer well satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe pacing, criticized in some circles as slow, is indeed that at times-- but in more of a \"slow burn\" kind of way. On my end, a solid two hour movie is most often a treat, as it provides the opportunity to become invested in the characters and atmosphere of a well made film. \r\n\r\nAlthough the sequence of events, as in the novel, is jumbled up, there seems to be an insinuation that this time, justice will be served, and two guilty men will take a ride on, as Dick glibly terms it, the \"big swing.\" With that in mind, the film is a giant lead-up to the hanging, a chilling scene that is masterfully realized.\r\n\r\nAlong the way we meet a host of characters-- neighbors, family members, fellow travelers, FBI men, and the Clutters-- a wholesome, well- liked family that sadly, really were murdered. Brooks' depiction of the cold blooded killers is just that, cold, and there are no attempts to defend or glorify the heinous men.\r\n\r\nWhile not all may enjoy the dark IN COLD BLOOD, and it is not necessarily a must see in my mind, it is nevertheless recommended viewing for those so inclined. As a novel adaption, and as a stand alone film, the final product is a chilling true to life account that will stick in your mind, for better or for worse.",

            "content": "The biggest mistake I made in finally watching the classic IN COLD BLOOD was watching it within hours of finishing the book, thus turning what I knew was a highly-praised crime thriller from the late 60s into yet another example in the classic story of \"the movie never lives up to the book.\"  So my first inclination was to basically dismiss the movie.  I wasn't sure that it had anything to offer someone who read the book, so faithful as it is to Truman Capote's masterpiece.\r\n\r\nFor this movie, I thought I'd play a game of \"three up, three down.\"  Here are the three main reasons why the movie IN COLD BLOOD is worth your time, folowed by three reasons why it just can't measure up to the book:\r\n\r\n1.  Conrad Hall's cinematography.  His name was the first that jumped out as I began watching...the master who passed away after the one-two punch of \"American Beauty\" and \"Road to Perdition\" after a long list of Oscar-nominated work behind the camera.  The scene where rain on a window reflects on Robert Blake's face as tears is something that even non-cinemaphiles would notice.  \r\n\r\n2.  Robert Blake and Scott Wilson.  Both men just LOOK like your vision of Perry and Dick when you read Capote's book.  They are pathetic enough, yet handsome enough.  Obscure enough, yet wild enough.  They're pitch perfect.  Maybe one of the reasons why I thought the film wasn't adding anything to the experience was because these two were almost exactly what I had created in my head for these killers. \r\n\r\n3.  The Clutter family house.  I did not know this when I was watching, but I found out that they filmed this movie in the actual house where the Clutter family was murdered.  How creepy!  That instantly made me appreciate the film more.  You'd never get permission to do something like that today!  Robert Blake said that it was important to not be \"too Hollywood\" about the film by making it somewhere else.  To be watching and know that the place where the actors were tied up and killed was actually where it happened gives one a chill that few crime movies can muster.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fairness, here are three reasons why the film falls short of greatness:\r\n\r\n1.  A voice-over/narrator comes in toward the end.  I think it's supposed to be like the voice of Capote.  It's not needed.  It sends the film off in a different direction than it was going.  And it's out of joint with everything else.  I took that as a sign of weakness in tidying up the film that the director felt that was needed.  It complicated what was otherwise a sparsely-told and filmed story.\r\n\r\n2.  That age old problem of pared-down character development from page to screen causes us to lose a lot of the complexity of the two men.  I know this is to be expected, but it is at the expense of things like Dick's pedophelia and Perry's old Army buddy, who tries to remain his friend.  \r\n\r\n3.  I didn't feel like there was a lot of artistry in the translation, short of moments of Hall's camera brilliance.  With the exception of the trick of Perry seeing his father's face in others (a way of stylizing for the audience the notion that Perry comes from a violent past), everything else in the film is as literally lifted from the book as possible.  Consequently, once you've read the book, there's less of a reason to watch the film.  There's not much of a creative spin put on the material.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in the virtual skipping over of the court proceedings, one of the best sections of the book.  And I was also miffed by the toning down of racial prejudice from book to film, but I suspect that was the sacrifice made in 1967 to get it made.  Having said that, I give IN COLD BLOOD a qualified thumbs-up as a classic film worth seeing.  But nowhere near as good as the Truman Capote book!",

The audience I was it with clapped and cheered. Fun, fun. And worth seeing on the big screen.\n\nI'm still not really sure what to think about [b]Catch and Release[/b]. It's not really a romantic comedy, though there are bits of that. It's not really a tragedy, though elements of that are present, too. And it's not really great, but it has some good moments. Jennifer Garner (\"Ghost of Girlfriends Past\") stars as a woman whose fiancee dies and then she discovers that he had a child he never told her about. I guess it's just an interesting character study. I did think about it for several days, which is always a plus.\n\n[b]In Cold Blood[/b] is the film version of Truman Capote's nonfiction novel of the same name. It runs very much like the book, with the build-up before the crime, the investigation and trials afterward. The film is dry, but still compelling. If you enjoy Court TV, this should be right up your alley.\n\nFor the first fifteen minutes or so of the new [b]Friday the 13th[/b], I was totally pumped. It was goofy, dirty and bloody - all elements of a great slasher. Then it tried to have a story, and I just got bored. I'm not saying that slashers can't have stories. I'm just saying this was a bad one. It felt like just another tired sequel in this already overstretched franchise. Disappointing.\n\nEvery time Darren Aronofsky (\"The Fountain\") makes a movie, I'm reassured that he's a genius. [b]The Wrestler[/b] is no exception. Mickey Rourke (\"Domino\") is amazing in the title character, an aging professional wrestler who just doesn't know how to do anything else. The whole thing is heartbreaking. And wonderful.",

            "content": "I still haven't gotten around to reading the book, I'm afraid.  I meant to after I'd finished [i]Capote[/i], and I didn't.  Perhaps I'll have watched it by the time we get to [i]Infamous[/i], the other telling of Truman Capote's version of events.  Because, of course, pretty much what we have is Truman Capote's version of events, and how accurate you consider that has a lot to do with what you think of Capote.  (Frankly, I shall always think of him as a fat little man in a red suit; thank you, 'Bots.)  There are certain bare facts that cannot be changed; Herbert, Bonnie, Nancy, and Kenyon Clutter are dead.  (Herein played by John McLiam, Ruth Storey, Brenda C. Currin, and Paul Hough.)  Perry Smith (Robert Blake) and Dick Hickock (Scott Wilson) killed them and were executed by the state of Kansas for their actions.  For the rest, we must look to what Capote got out of them and what can be gleaned from other sources.  And here, of course, Capote is our main source, since the movie is, at least in theory, based on his book.\r\n\r\nWhen Dick Hickock was in prison, his cellmate, Floyd Wells, told him that Wells had once worked for a Kansas farmer named Herbert Clutter.  Clutter, Wells claimed, had a safe with a great deal of money in it.  It would be an easy job for anyone with the will to accomplish it.  So Hickock and a prison friend, Perry Smith, cross into Kansas, breaking Smith's parole, and seek out the Clutter farm in Holcomb, Kansas.  Wikipedia describes the murders of the Clutters as part of the plan unraveling, but it's clear from the outset that the Clutters will not live through the night.  After all, Hickock says repeatedly that they will leave no witnesses.  What [i]is[/i] an unforeseen event is that Herbert Clutter had no safe.  He made as many transactions as possible by check, and all in all, there was some $40 in the house.  Hickock and Smith took off on a career of frankly stupid crimes, mostly check fraud, and are eventually captured in part because they are driving a stolen car.\r\n\r\nWe'll stick to the facts of the Clutter case, here, tempting though it may be to drift into Blake's own murder trial.  However, I think there is enough material about Hickock and Smith to occupy, well--it's said that Capote amassed 8000 pages of research, and I'm only trying to fill five paragraphs.  Part of the chilling aspect of the film, in fact, is the possibility that these men may well be sociopaths.  I've read some speculation that at least Smith was probably schizophrenic.  Apparently, Capote indicated that the men might not have been entirely repsonsible for their own actions.  It is also, however, indicated that no psychological evidence was presented at the trial by either side.  Obviously, as I've never read the book, there's only so much I know about the case.  It's possible that the punishment--even without going into death penalty arguments--was too severe, and that the men could not have formed intent.  It's an interesting speculation, anyway.\r\n\r\nMentally ill they may have been, but all that bright Smith and Hickock were not.  The decision to leave no witnesses was, in and of itself, not the smartest decision that could have been made.  The original plan to disguise themselves with black stockings would have made it possible to avoid the gallows.  Further, making their escape by writing bad checks just left a paper trail that was easier to follow.  The escape to Mexico wasn't a bad idea, but the return to the US was.  And at the heart of the story, it seems to me unlikely that trusting a random cellmate about the location of a $10,000 payoff was a good idea.  I don't know for certain that there was malicious intent there; in fact, I rather doubt it.  But I am given to understand that jailhouse stories are prone to exaggeration, and this one seems more likely, given Clutter's propensity for writing checks, to have been an outright lie.\r\n\r\n1967 was a curious year in film.  [i]The Graduate[/i] beat [i]In Cold Blood[/i] for Best Director.  [i]Bonnie and Clyde[/i] (which you won't see here, because I hate that movie) beat it for Cinematography.  [i]Thoroughly Modern Millie[/i] won for Original Score.  [i]In the Heat of the Night[/i] won for Adapted Screenplay.  The five movies really have very little in common with one another except the year they came out.  In feel, [i]In Cold Blood[/i] is the oldest.  It's from the same year as the others, but it does project a '50s mentality.  In that sense, it captures the time it's supposed to quite well.  The Clutter murder is a hint at the darker side of an era we see as wholesome, and I think it does very well at that.",

One may even quibble about how Smith and Hickock are both careless criminals, but in reality, they [i]do[/i] exist. There is one precise scene that gives an impression of being an out of place; when both Perry and Dick pick up two hitchhikers. However, through the eyes of their parent, is when we see somewhat of a compassionate nature with these two convicted felons. Also, Perry Smith's flashbacks, make him less-menacing. These events of his unpleasant childhood memories are melancholic. Even Conrad L. Hall's ([i]American Beauty[/i]) cinematography, similarly adds an unambiguously bleak tone. The film succeeds brilliantly when Brooks focuses on the two criminals' backgrounds, not to see them entirely as monsters; how \"neither one of them would have done it alone.
