    "summary": "Edmundo Nobile (Enrique Rambal) invites friends over for an opulent dinner party. While the guests enjoy their food, the servants disappear one by one. Afterward, the visitors retire to the salon for an evening of music and conversation -- but in the morning, they are mysteriously incapable of leaving the room. As days go by and they run out of food and water, panic and madness set in. The army and the police arrive, but fail in their attempts to enter the house as conditions inside deteriorate.",

            "content": "The surrealism and absurdity of this movie would be much less perplexing if you had watched Luis Buñuel's French movies. You would also probably ascertain that he has been essentially making the same film for over a decade.\nYou can interpret many motifs in this film since the eventual reason for their entrapment is kept purposefully unclear. Could it be a rich-vanity bubble that can only be escaped by adherence to their inane, never-ending rituals? The facade of high society etiquette that becomes irrelevant the moment the rich have to break a wall to get water (or apparently, as it was originally planned, resort to cannibalism)? Varied jabs at Franco's regime in Spain? It can be all of it. The main point is that, in the end, no one learned anything.\nBut aside from this metaphorical malarkey, is this story interesting to watch? I'd say yes. The short runtime of the movie and characters quickly acknowledging the absurdity of their situation help you not lose focus. Even if the first 15 minutes are just nameless figures greeting each other in purposeful scenes of repetition, followed by the practical survival of 20+ people in one room.",

In a creative parable involving the abysmal reality of having too much of a good thing, the film's key players rail and dwindle away amidst opulence that devolves into a state of savage primitivity. Despite a brilliant conceptual foundation and a sublimely satisfying conclusion, the film feels mercilessly strained, as though desperately trying to shake off its inevitable fate as a one-trick pony. Moments of comic and surreal brilliance periodically shine through, however the inescapable conclusion of this writer is that the film suffers from a lack of optimal formatting: like Bunuel's immaculately executed \"Simon of the Desert,\" the present work may have functioned better in short form. In keeping with the reductive theme, narrowing the number of key players may also have strengthened our attachment to the story through greater familiarity with its central protagonists. As one of Bunuel's more misguided works, \"The Exterminating Angel\" intimates a level of brilliance that its restrictive plot structure unfortunately struggles to sustain.",

The director then takes his time stripping away the veneer of respectability and class in social crusade, and with a style not unlike that of Lord of the Flies; allowing suppressed grievances to gradually be aired as the situation deteriorates. Caviar gets replaced with water from a burst pipe and sheep roasted over the remains of a cello. Biting stuff, but Buñuel takes care to leave the specific circumstances of a general criticism of the upper crust open to interpretation. \n\nAnd what an ending, with so many questions posed in the final scene. Such a great way to conclude a science fiction-esque surrealist threat, leaving the criteria for its activation vague, and the threat still very present. \n\nBuñuel's process must have caught the attention of animal rights groups by the '60s - the violence against his barnyard actors is only implied this time around.

The problem with most absurdities and farces is that they deal with some ridiculous situation which we either buy or don't buy.  Here, the situation is a mystery, servants suddenly leaving, everyone engaging in a giant slumber party, which is out of order for these people.  There's a bear and sheep in the house, a dead chicken in a purse.  A man is unconscious, dying perhaps.  \"What's happening to us?\" Doctor asks right before a thunderstorm.  It's intriguing, something is in the air and we don't know what it is, it's a total mystery.  It could be equally satisfying if we never find out.\n\nEverything that once was sexy is now disgusting.  These people are filthy, un showered, their backends probably a mess. Where once we could picture a fairly sexy upper-class orgy, now we dream of escaping from one another.\n\nThe film is relentless, almost never letting go of the ever-increasing tension that drives these characters to madness.  We wonder to ourselves if there was something we missed - did they get trapped?  Barricaded by the people on the outside?  How did they suddenly start showing up?  Revelations come in the form of degenerating behavior while questions continue to be raised.  At no point do I lose interest in what's happening while still dying for answers, a perfect blend of engaging in experience while needing to know.  \n\nWe reach our most savage point when sheep are slaughtered, a dead couple are laughed at, and a royal rumble breaks out.  We wonder what satisfying solution could possibly come about, and most ideas that go through my head are unsatisfying.  But Bunuel works the unexpected, re-staging everyone exactly as they were before this mysterious curse trapped everyone.  One of the women is able to identify this, trying to guide everyone to retrace their steps until they can figure out what locked them in the first place - she equates the exercise to chess.  Eventually they stumble on a point in which someone declared it was time to retire, which seemed to generate a compulsive etiquette that resulted in the ensuing problem.\n\nTime and space is a constant distortion - the couple thinks they've been their around a month, one of the ladies thinks they were at the opera \"tonight.\"  The room seems to change positions.  The rest of the mansion becomes forbidden, they are locked in one space.  A black curtain forms, the homeowner on the other side.  Where exactly does the painting door lead to?  Bathroom?  Where is the bathroom anyway?  Sheep go upstairs, but arrive in the room where everyone is for their sacrifice.",

The issue I had with this film is it kind of goes in streaks, of scenes I love and scenes I find dispensable. When it began, it felt somewhat choppy- I later understood the purpose of this- but regardless that is the affect it gave, making it hard to get into. Once the story began about the group of bourgeoisie members trapped in tan upscale room, it had many funny lines and ironic scenes. But as the film went along I felt that I was trapped in the same prison the characters were in, and just like everyone in the room wanted to get away from these idiots. By the time the hallucinations began I started enjoying the comedic work again, but there was a long point in the film where I couldn't wait for it to end. While I found the comedy successful the surrealism was clear but not effective. I love surrealistic pieces like Eraserhead or Un Chien Andalou- which Bunuel himself contributed too. But all the ones I love are eerie, dark, and symbolic. The surrealism in The Exterminating Angel, silly and weird but not eerie, dark, or symbolic. Bunuel has two obsession in his films, Christianity and the bourgeoisie. While there are funny moments regarding both categories, I can't distinguish his statement on either. Was the point that the bourgeoisie were becoming the working class, they once couldn't understand? Are they now the ones that are trapped, like their inferiors were once? That's the most I understood, but even their I can't complete the puzzle.",

Instead the upshot is executed with a much murkier distinction, conspicuously they are all pawns in Bruñuel's storybook, it is rather an exacting task to distinguish all the different roles from a first-viewing, if only Robert Altman would do a remake, and expunge the political metaphor of the ending, then it would be transformed into a highly-watchable character analysis and an incisive farce with eye-dropping theatrical showpieces.\n\nOf course Bruñuel's mastery is omnipresent in the film, the superimposition shot of a clear sky upon a facial portrait, the outlandish amalgam of lambs and a baby bear, and the creative approach to offer a vent to let them out (a Paradisi's sonata is the turning point), until the climax, we all realize it is just a trial run, and the denouement is a dual indictment on undiscerning religious belief and the political status quo at then, pepped up with a palpable feeling of hopelessness. \n\nAlso the slap to the bourgeois is loud and clear since the film's opening, it is the servants who are sentient of the pending uncanniness, and urge to leave the house as soon as possible, only the obtuse are being entrapped by the almighty trickster. Then what happens to the hoi polloi in the church? The purge is more generic or we should merely stop over-interpretation? Anyway who needs a concrete answer as long as Bruñuel is concerned.",

Why can't you leave? I don't know, you just can't. And you can't figure it out either. So the best you can do is figure out where the water pipe is located and how you can find some food because it's going to be a long time before you're able to leave. Oh, and on top of that, imagine if people couldn't even come close to you. It's absurd, but also terrifying. Those who you were friends with at first might become your enemy, or those you disliked might be someone you come close to killing. That's the way this bourgeois group of people behave. They blame the host for the problem even though the host is stuck in there with them. How could this possibly benefit him? There is a young couple who have spent their first date at the opera and they were going to go home together afterword, but now they are stuck in this room. Luckily a doctor is present because an old man has difficulties breathing and seems to be slipping away. So what is Bunuel doing here? Putting a class of people in a room that he doesn't like and forcing them to reveal the horribleness at their core? That would be my best guess at least. Luckily there were sheep in the house as a joke for earlier. They find their way into the room, and the people end up eating them. One guy gives way to his sexual urges and ends up kissing a woman in her sleep. The young couple end up killing themselves in the closet. The old man dies and they put him in another closet. This story could take place over the span of a month or a few days. There's really no way to know. When we see them go to sleep we don't know if this is a new night, or perhaps they sleep more because there's nothing to do. If you look at it that way it becomes even more comedic. One of the women at the party realizes that they are all in the same position they were in the first night before they took off their jackets and went to sleep. So what does she do? Have them repeat everything in order to follow through with a different ending this time. This time, they are all going to say it's late and they must be heading out instead of sticking around for no apparent reason. This plan works, only for the same problem to occur once they are out. At the funeral the whole congregation seems to not be able to leave, and we get a flash forward where gunshots are heard. If I had a gun I would probably shoot myself if that happened to me twice. Imagine the fear of it happening to you repeatedly throughout your life! I liked the surreal aspects of the double entrance of the party guests and the animals that make their way through a house empty of people. This is Bunuel at his finest and should not go overlooked by an fan of surrealism.",

The movie has a bunch of wealthy socialites in a fancy mansion (doesn't it seem like all 1960s European art movies are about wealthy socialites?) who enjoy a dinner party, but then find themselves unable to leave the house, for no apparent reason. You know how sometimes when you're with a large group of people trying to decide what bar or restaurant to go to, but for some reason reaching a decision and going just seems impossible? These people have a life-threatening case of that. Things devolve as the days drag on, and social commentary is made. The large cast is good, but they're all 1960s Spanish actors that neither you nor I have ever heard of or will likely ever hear of again, so I won't bother discussing their performances.\n\nI guess what bothered me was how surprisingly low-key and low-stakes the movie ended up feeling. I was hoping things would end up in blood orgies and cannibalism, but we didn't quite get there. By the time they leave, their clothes aren't even as shredded as I would have liked. Sure, some weird stuff happens, and some people do die, but of sickness or off-screen suicide. Plus, although the movie obviously wants to make a comment on people's hypocrisy, none of the characters are really fleshed out enough before their entrapment to convince us that their changes are so against their principles. You just have to go into the movie with a firm image of the bourgeoisie already in mind. I think the movie might have worked better for me with a smaller cast of more thoroughly developed characters, and had it gone to more outrageously absurd lengths. There's some great stuff here, don't get me wrong; but I wasn't as blown away by it as I had thought I would be.",

It's been a few days since i've seen it and it continues to grow on me. I really regret shipping this out so quick, a second viewing is much needed.",

'The Exterminating Angel' is a funny movie on us, humans, and what's beneath our veil. Bunuel's movie is an absurdist joke with no explanations and a blast to sit through.",

The doors are unlocked and the windows are open, yet they don't leave, starving themselves of food and water. It's crazy. Bizarre. Insane. Compulsively watchable and at times, very funny.
