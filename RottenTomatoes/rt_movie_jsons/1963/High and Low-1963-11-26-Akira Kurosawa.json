At a running time of nearly two and a half hours, the film absorbs you in to the story and setting, from the mansion that Gondo (Toshirô Mifune) owns where the first hour takes place to the drug infested streets, and never lets go! While you admire Gondo for making such a huge sacrifice to save the child's life, you feel sick to think of how his life dive bombs because of it. What a totally engaging film that is so beautifully captured in all of it's details that it makes a long film seem short and makes you hope that it never ends! Highly Recommended, especially for Kurosawa fans and fans of the film-noir genre!",

            "content": "High and Low is a very good movie, a taut investigative thriller that keeps the tension up throughout the entire runtime. So when I say it might not even crack the top five best films from Kurosawa, it's not a knock on this particular movie but a remark on how good the director's filmography is. \n\nThere's a lot to like about High and Low, first and foremost hinging much of the plot on a moral decision; you get to know these characters just enough to get a sense of their lifestyle, before the script dangles it all on a razor's edge, all the hopes and ambitions of one man's entire life suddenly are rendered insecure as his base morality is called into question. And subsequently, you get to see the relative fallout from his paradoxical choice; despite making the right call, the demands of conservative Japanese society end up resulting in real penalties for him regardless. But while the film could have been a tighter, perhaps more pointed classic if it were to focus only on Mifune's tortured Gondo, the script evolves into a pure investigative film, revealing the identity of the culprit but allowing the audience to take part in the series of incremental clues that gradually tighten the net around him in a pseudo-Hitchcockian manner. While that sort of dynamic could have easily slipped into 'a tale of two films', the direction keeps the plot grounded and appropriately interwoven, capped by some great ground-level shots of semiurban postwar Japan. \n\nWhile not as overtly philosophical as many of the period pieces that Kurosawa is most often associated with, High and Low still showcases much of the attention to detail that he is known for and gives a bit of depth to his more traditional subject matter, allowing him to work with pure thriller elements in addition to moral qualms. (4.5/5)",

            "content": "Right off the bat I love the whole noir feel to the film with the smokey city in the background and the cool jazz music during the opening credits. I love how attentive and alert the camera work is. It makes everything seem much more thrilling and interesting than it really is. It's intriguing to watch how these plots between powerful people are concocted. They're literally just lounging around in Gondo's apartment plotting to overtake the company president. Gondo, the head of factory, seems to be getting a good deal, but you never know if the other three can turn around and blame him if anything goes south. I admire Gondo's virtuous values of honor, honesty and integrity towards the shoes his factory make. He's not willing to downgrade quality just so all the execs can put more money in their pockets, I respect that. Unbelievable how greedy and selfish those three execs are, saying that they will take Gondo out if he doesn't play ball. Wow, the is an incredibly captivating way to start the movie - full of intensity, tension and drama. It puts us right in the middle. The setup is impeccable. \n\nI love how Gondo's kids are playing outlaw vs. sheriff - perhaps foreshadowing how the events between Gondo and the execs are going to play out. Ok wow, my opinion of Gondo has kind of changed. He's risked everything, bet everything - something very dangerous and reckless - on this one business deal with someone who we don't even know yet. So cool seeing Nakadai as Chief Inspector Tokura. I feel like Kawanashi, Gondo's right hand man, might be somewhat involved or is going to be involved when he leaves to go to the airport, in the kidnapping that's taken place. I can't imagine how hard this whole situation for Gondo is. On one hand, he's got the money to pay for the kidnapper's ransom, but on the other hand it's the same money that he's going to use for the business opportunity. It's a very interesting situation because the child they kidnapped wasn't Gondo's, it was his helpers son, Aoki. So now this moral dilemma comes into play of will he or won't he save Aoki's son. I wonder what actions Gondo will take. Is he willing to sacrifice everything on saving someone else's child? \n\nHoly shit! Things get intense on the train. Duuuude, with all the passengers on the train and the hand held camera, it feels legit. Sooo good! Dude I can't believe he threw out 30 million yen out of the window without even knowing if they're going to keep their word! Ok this movie is fucking brilliant. The first half of the movie was all inside the apartment. Now we're traveling around, exploring adventuring. This is truly a pleasant surprise. I thought the whole movie was going to take place in the apartment. That shot of everyone watching the filmed footage that was taken on the train has great meme potential. What a great shot. I don't know how I knew, but I knew that they were going to show the pink smoke with actual color. That's crazy! That club scene with all the Americans and the funny black guy was so unexpected. Lol. That was pretty ballsy how they did the drug handoff right in the middle of the dance floor as they were dancing. That whole club scene really changed the mood of the entire movie at that point - sort of livening it up and adding some fun into it. Wow, that Dope Alley scene was pretty terrifying and quite sad. Seeing all those strung out addicts just looming around like zombies. Kind of scary. I'm glad justice was served in the end. What a powerful ending. That final performance from the guy who plays Takeuchi was so good. And the way he gets dragged off and the gate closes right on Gondo's face and all we see is his reflection was finale perfection. I liked how we get a glimpse into Takeuchi's backstory. It sort of solidifies why he did what he did. But at the same time it doesn't excuse him of the crimes he committed. The man was sociopathic and what he did was malicious and evil. \n\nThis is perhaps one of Kurosawa's most modern-looking movies he's ever made - and it looks outstanding! You can tell by the cinematography and how the story unfolds, that this is a brilliant movie. The whole journey Gondo goes through is a trial of morals, ethics and doing what's right. This movie proves that you don't have to film in dozens of different locations to make an exceptional film. If the writing is solid and the acting is true, that's all that matters. This is very similar to 12 Angry Men and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest where both take place within the same location for the majority of the movie, and both are masterpieces of cinema. The way Kurosawa used actors to kind of frame or block shots was so good. The lighting is subtle and underrated, you would never notice how exquisite it was if you weren't looking for it. Like the way Gondo is sitting in the background and all you can see is his silhouette. One of the most exemplary things about this movie is that you feel like you're there, in the middle of everything, taking part in everything that's going on. Every decision, every thought. This movie proves that not every rich person is a selfish greedy monster. The first half is all about getting Aoki's son back while the second half is the procedural detective work trying to nab the kidnapper and return the money. A brilliant detective thriller movie. It was a great ride, I wouldn't mind taking it again.",

The second half (so, 60%), out in Yokohama, is much free-er and much more interesting.

With perfect drama they ratchet up the tension to the point that you almost can’t breathe. Each scene is perfectly captured with brilliant framing and creative camerawork. The shots reinforce the theme and direct your eyes to see what is most important. The acting is amazing, and each actor seems to give their all. Toshiro Mifune is off the charts in the early scenes as he shows a full range of emotions and you can feel the dilemma tugging at his heart. Then it shifts to the police and we get to watch one of the most thorough procedural dramas ever captured on film.

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is counted among the best directors in the world. Best known for Seven Samurai to American audiences, High and Low also deserves a lot more attention here. This is a film about a kidnapping, but it is hardly conventional. You think the film is heading in one way, only to veer off in a totally different direction. The film starts with the machinations of a business takeover, only to veer into a kidnapping story--and by the way, setting up the the best red herring ever seen on film. So now, you think the film is going to be about rescuing the child, but the child is recovered halfway through, and suddenly the film is a police procedural.\n\nMuch of the tension in the first half of the film is the result of the film veering off into a different direction. Businessman Kingo Gondo has just mortgaged everything he had in fund his takeover of National Shoes when he receives a phone call from the kidnapper demanding most of that money in return for his son. But then it turns out the kidnapper took the wrong child. Nevertheless, the kidnapper still demands the same ransom, setting up a fascinating moral dilemna for Gondo. It is one thing to break oneself for the return for your own child, but quite another to do it for someone else. The decision Gondo has to make is not easy, and the film does not hold back here. Gondo decides to pay the ransom, and as it turns out, it does break him. Though Gondo earns a great deal of public goodwill, goodwill doesn't pay the bills. Most of the ransom money is recovered, but too late to save Gondo. It's a moral theme we've seen before in Seven Samurai--the duty of the powerful toward the helpless, even at the cost of one's life or financial ruin. \n\nWhen the film turns to the police procedural, we get a reminder that police could solve crimes without relying on DNA testing. A lot of it is footwork, such as testing which phone booths have the best view of Gondo's living room. Science helps by leading the police to the accomplices, though too late. They amass enough evidence to convict the kidnapper, but the police use good old-fashioned trickery to also convict the kidnapper for murder. Interestingly enough, the police remain all too human here. They want to get the kidnapper for murder as well, but not because they cared about those victims, who were, after all, just drug addicts. That they were murdered doesn't really matter to them. They only have Gondo's suffering in view. The kidnapper, Takeuchi, was brilliant in the planning and execution of the kidnapping, but ultimately was no match for a police department focussed on bringing him in.\n\nTakeuchi's motivation is never fully spelled out, and this is to the film's credit. He had a hard life living under Gondo's hillside house, but Takeuchi apparently never knew Gondo personally. It seems that Gondo's house on the hill, overlooking the city like an overlord and having the comforts of wealth was enough to make Takeuchi hate him. But Takeuchi was a highly intelligent, extremely self-disciplined medical intern. A few years hence, and Takeuchi probably would have been as well off as Gondo. Gondo himself had followed that route, though in his case, he was helped by marrying rich. Nevertheless, Gondo and Takeuchi are in many ways the flip side of the same coin, a fact emphasized in the final scene where their conversation takes place with the reflection of the speaker superimposed on the other. \"Must we hate each other?\" Gondo asks. The question remains unanswered, but the social commentary inherent in the question speaks volumes.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is one of the greatest film directors in the history of cinema, his films have endured such legacies that often times his films are so highly regarded that even those who wish to hate his films for their popularity and influence can't find themselves to do so.  In his 1963 crime film \"High and Low,\" guilt drives many of the characters into doing what is the right thing to do even if they wish not to.\nKingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) has a splendid house that overlooks the city in which he lives, causing great envy among all who live below in the valley.  He has dedicated his life to National Shoe Company and is on the board of directors.  When three other members of the board of directors want to recruit him to vote an older man off the board to make cheaper shoes to reap more financial reward, Gondo rebuffs.  Gondo visualizes a quality shoe that would not return much profit in the short term but eventually in time, show great rewards while saving the company.  This angers the other members as they leave his house in anger.\nGondo then reveals to his wife and closest associate that he has slowly been buying stock in the National Shoe Company and has just mortgaged everything for 30 million yen to buy more, he would then have 48% of the company's stock.  But before he can carry out this plan he receives a phone call stating his son had been kidnapped and they are demanding that very same price.  Gondo is quick to want to pay the ransom to get his son back before he realizes that the kidnapper kidnapped his chauffeur's son instead and now he has reserves about paying the ransom.  Eventually after a lot of discussion and guilt he agrees and the kid is returned to his father.  \nThe first hour of the film all takes place inside one room in Gondo's large house before going to different locations around the city as the police, who feel bad for Gondo because he's now in debt, start to look for the kidnapper to bring him to justice.\nA masterfully told crime drama that moves quickly.",

High and Low is a film that expands its scope before you very eyes, as it begins as an intimate character study in a penthouse, and by the end swells into a nationwide manhunt for the bastard who kidnapped his son.

In two wildly different acts the film manages to be both a complex morality tale and police-procedural thriller. \n\tThe first act watches like a domestic drama. We never leave Gondo's home, but it is in this seemingly claustrophobic setting that we witness Kurosawa's brilliant use of space and increasing adeptness with widescreen composition. Watch how he places his characters: the police passively observing as the chauffeur finally breaks down and begs Gondo to save his son; and Gondo backed into the far right of the screen, writhing against the window in the knowledge that the moral imperative of saving the child will ruin him; the frame is so packed with kinetic characterization that we seem to feel movement despite a static camera. \n\tIn act 2 we really start to move and are reminded of Kurosawa's masterful use of tracking shots to plunge into the unknown. Much like the penetration into the forests of \"Rashomon\" and \"Throne of Blood,\" the camera freely roams about a different type of jungle: the slums below Gondo's stately home as we follow the brilliantly systematic police force in their quest to find the villain. \n\tThe lack of unity and disparate stylistic approaches between the two halves of the film are set up by the title: \"High and Low.\" The disjunct nature of the film gives it it's charm but may also be the barrier that has kept the film from enjoying the same level of acclaim as Kurosawa's more stylistically unified works. This film is loaded: It's an examination of morality as well as a critique of individualism and ambition. It's a head-scratching whodunit and police-procedural potboiler, but above all it is endlessly entertaining.",

However, High and Low (Heaven and Hell in the original Japanese) has to be included in the list.  One of the handful of modern day films in his oeuvre, Tengoku to Jigoku is ripped from a police procedural by Ed McBain and is as exciting as any AK film gets.  The film breaks roughly into three parts:  1) a serious drama in which businessman Toshiro Mifune tries to defend his way of making shoes by gaining control of the company, in direct conflict with other scheming executives and his disloyal assistant, but is suddenly faced with the fact that he might have to pay all of the necessary funds as ransom when his chauffeur's son is kidnaped in place of his own son;  2) a fast-paced investigation by the entire police force led by Inspector Tetsuya Nakadai that eventually frees the boy and identifies the killer; 3) the final trap and capture of the killer, Tsutomo Yamazaki (later Goro in Tampopo), who stalks the seedy underbelly of Yokohama in mirrored shades.  Kurosawa stages it all in widescreen with some incredible compositions that make the most of the bigger canvass (including wide open landscapes as well as a bunch of cops cramming the screen).  As always, viewers are encouraged to see the drama not only from an objective outside perspective but also from the point of view of other characters who are party to the action (in this case, we see the police view of the actions taken by Gondo the shoe executive as well as hearing what the public thinks).  In Kurosawa, there is always an acknowledgement of the multiple ways of seeing reality.  As it should be.",

Interestingly, only the first hour deals with Mifune's businessman and the ransom. The rest is a police procedural as they hunt for the kidnapper. Mifune is unusually subdued here, particularly when coming to terms with the consequences of his choice. It fits well on him. Somehow you can see the fire restrained without ever feeling like it's lessened. His character is so good in fact that the film suffers when he is absent. A few more looks at how he deals with his situation would have helped immensely. Essentially the character study is good, the detective drama is good, but the combination is missing something.

The social commentary is laid on pretty thick, but it never detracts from the plot.\n\nI will say, I enjoyed the first 50 minutes of the film more than the last half. It's very impressive since it almost all takes place within a single room.  It is also when the single most important decision in the film is made, and the emotional impact resonates through the rest of the film.  In addition, the long cuts must have been very difficult to shoot.  The cinematography is equally impressive, without a wasted space.  The second half is a pretty standard detective procedural, but still very well done and keeps you interested until the end with an especially eerie moment in an alley filled with heroin junkies.\n\nGoing back tot he social commentary, I'll finally add, that there's an important point made in a somewhat throwaway line that will probably be lost on a non-Japanese audience.  The Toshiro Mifune character mentions starting off early in a shoe factory and working his way up.  This means he'd have been working with leather, which gives him 'burakumin' (untouchable) status, making some of the moments, statements, and choices a little more poignant.",

It definitely made me consider just how different contemporary Hollywood filmmaking is from this though.  I easily imagined numerous surprise plot twists that could have fit into the storyline at various points over the course of the picture.  Storylines in this genre have become far more convoluted and complex over the subsequent decades.  However, there were definitely films of this era (not sure about from Japan) that had surprise twists.  I think it's more a Kurosawa trait than a Hollywood v. Japan trait, or even a past v. present trait.  Kurosawa isn't interested in a complex plot.  He simply wants to tell us like it is, in a straightforward and conventional manner.  He gives us a rather detailed view into the complex process of tracking down the villain.  I can think of few better (Zodiac would be one).",

I must admit I had high hopes for Yojimbo and Sanjuro, but I was sort of let down both times. They were both good movies but they weren't profound or psychologically thrilling, but High and Low exceeded all expectations I had. This mammoth achievement has great acting, a flawless script (adapted from an Ed McBain novel), and superb direction from Kurosawa. Toshiro Mifune is awesome as Kingo Gondo (gotta love that name), a man troubled by business affairs and a pesky kidnapper who wants 30 million from him. An excellent study of human morality and the extents to which we are value money. The film also feature a solid performance from Tatsuya Nakadai, a police officer trying to crack this case. The script is composed to such a high degree of perfection that it keeps you engaged from the beginning when Gondo says \"So what do you want?\" to the end which shows a very psychologically challenging and emotionally gripping scene. Kurosawa executes the script brilliantly with his pacing and his depiction of the city in wide screen format. The film reminds me a lot of Stray Dog and how interesting the relationship between a cop and a criminal is. This film tops Stray Dog though by a long shot. This is probably the best police procedural film I have seen. The entire movie is a thrill ride with a remarkable ending which is so genuine in it's exploration of human nature, desire, and social mentality that it is neither existential nor happy. Definitely something I'll be coming back to again and again for years.",

I think the movie should have tackled what the decision meant to Gondo more. Maybe even showing a fantasy sequence where he also turns down the ransom (or if really brave, make the ransom paying version be the fantasy). Instead of all of the procedural stuff trying to catch the kidnapper (which wasn't dramatic at all), it should have kept its focus on Gondo and made him perhaps regret his decision once he starts to lose everything. I know that wasn't the director's intent, but if I was able to remake it that's where I'd put the attention during the 2nd half, instead of the procedural stuff on the dramatically boring kidnapper.\n\nNote: I guess I'm looking at it through rose-tinted glasses; I'm sure all of the police procedural stuff was fresh and exciting at the time, but is now just average by-the-book procedure we've seen in movies 100 times.",

Mifune is great as usual, but he is easily matched by Tatsuya Nakadai and Tsutomu Yamazaki's acting, which is rare (Mifune almost always steals the show).

This is an adaptation of a work by Ed McBain, who specialized noir fiction. This resulting adaptation is a westernized but Japanese take on film noir, and the results are pretty impressive. \n\nThe story concerns a wealthy industrialist who is planning on trying to buy out his company after disagreements on what direction the company should take. In order to do this, he has put up a considerable amoutn of money, even the mortgage to his home. A short time after a meeting with others bigwigs of his comany, his son goes missing, and he gets a call saying that his son has been kidnapped. It turns out however that the wrong kod was taken, and the caller has his chauffeur's son instead. What follows is a wonderful moral dilemma: either the man can pay the ransom, save the kid and lose everyhting else (his life depends on his job) or save his job and let a kid who isn't his be killed. \n\nOverall, this is a very tense film that not only works as a crime thriller, but also gives great insight into the contemporary (at the time) values of Japanese society and the innerworkings of Japanese law enforcement. This is a long film, and it really feels like two in one, with the first half devoted to dealing with the moral debate, and the second half being a police procedural that follows the efforts to track down the kidnapper and bring him to justice.\n\nThe film is mostly shot in wideshots, with a number of long takes. The beauty of all this is how well this works in getting the audience involved in the situations and really amping up the tension. After a while I barely even noticied that fair amoutns of time passed between cuts. When long takes don't bring attention to themselves, then you know this is a sign that the director is using them for the right reasons, and isn't trying to be a showoff. They actually have power and meaning here. Granted, this is Kurosawa we're talking about, but still. Aside from this though, the cinematography overall is quite well done and the black and white looks great and really adds to the atmosphere.\n\nThe acting is top notch. Long time Kurosawa collaborator Toshiro Mifune is wonderful as Kingo Gondo the conflicted industrialist. Tatsuya Nakadai is good as Inspector Tokura, and Tsutomu Yamazaki is suitably menacing as the kidnapper Ginji Takeuchi. The acting and cinematography aren't the only highlights though, as the whole film is just a real piece of work. It's got a compelling stoary that's well written and conceived, and it brings up some great issues and situations for the characters to deal with. You care about what happens and really get involved in things.\n\nThe only real issue I had is that the film is rather long and seemed to drag here and there at times. I didn't mind it too much because I was engrossed in the story, but yeah, I did start to get a bit fidgety, so it could have been tighter. All in all, this is some really good stuff. I give this a pretty solid recommendation.",

The second half of the film goes into great detail as it examines the ensuing police procedure as they dedicate all their workforce into finding the kidnapper. All this results in a fascinating drama with scenes that would make Hitchcock proud but the film goes even further through examination of classes and how the poor are largely ignored yet there is great sympathy for the rich. \r\n\r\nMifune superbly demonstrates the inner conflict of his character's moral dilemma.

Not that I wasn't aware of his ingenuity bt creations like Seven Samurai & Rashomon had a different quality abt them. Here Kurosawa gets right into the field which Hitchcock mastered over the years,The structural thrillers which owe it's grasp on the viewer due to the editing,deft camera work & razor sharp narration and turns it into a cinematic experience unmatched. \n\nThe movie opens up with Mifune switching on the lights of drawing room of his house and camera sweeps across to reveal what's going to be a setting for 1/3rd of the movie, shot through different angles. It's almost like a stage where characters enter & leave as tension builds up through story as well as visually. The significance of the house doesn't stop there as you'll know when at sm point a detective aftr observing the house, perched high, from the lower ground  remarks..\"That house gets to you...as if it's looking down upon us\".And when film ends you wd know the visual significance of the house.\n\nAnd then one of the best train sequences I hv seen in Cinema that comes right onto u out of nowhere and leads into an engrossing & elaborate third act constituting investigation process and ending in those dark slimy alleys with a mournful tone that cd easily hv inspired WKW's style.It doesn't end there as u expect bcz there comes that final shot in which in one stroke Kurosawa blasts the shallow judgemental world  and unveils the basic nature of crime as superbly as ever.\n\nI can go on & on blabbering and still won't be able to capture every detail. High & Low is almost a course in Cinema & shd be a mandatory viewing for a genuine movie lover. Outstanding.",

            "content": "\"High and Low\" is one of those deceptive detective-thrillers that sneak in under your radar and grab you from behind with their storytelling magic. It's proof positive of Kurosawa's mastery of film and all its imagery.\nThe story was adapted from an Ed McBain \"87th Precinct\" novel, \"King's Ransom\", and is really very simple. A successful businessman (Mr. Gondo) in the middle of a major deal is told his son has been kidnapped. All concerns about money fly out the window...until Gondo learns it was actually his chauffeur's son who was taken by mistake. Doesn't matter; the kidnapper still wants him to pay the ransom, even though it will bankrupt him. Will Gondo destroy his standing in the business world to save the life of a child that is not even his? Or will he just leave it to the police and fate to determine whether the child lives or dies? This makes up the first half of the film.\nThe second half deals with the search for the kidnapper and his accomplices, and it does not shy away from showing how dull and grueling good police work is. Step by step, the cops narrow their field of suspects and build their evidence to link their prey to murder as well as the kidnapping, meaning he would face execution. This makes up the second half of the film.\nIt helps to know that in the original story, the businessman refuses to pay the ransom but does help the police track down the kidnappers. It also helps to understand that in Japan, working your way up from making shoes and satchels by hand to being in a position where you could wind up owning the company is a HUGE accomplishment in a caste driven society. It means he is due additional respect, and this is what Gondo faces losing if he pays the ransom, which is far more important than the fact that he will be driven into bankruptcy.\nFrom the first scene through an amazingly exciting section on a bullet train to the ending moments between Gondo and the kidnapper, Kurosawa shows exactly why he is a master of cinema. To take what is basically an episode of \"Law and Order\" and make it into a meditation on the meaning of life and evil is not something just any film school twit could do.\nTo me, the best moment on a human level comes when Gondo descends the stairs the morning after the kidnapping to explain to the police why he cannot pay the ransom for a child not even his. You can see the man realizing he is allowing himself go to hell in order to protect his family and station in life, and Toshiro Mifune underplays it beautifully...and Kurosawa lets it just simply happen. Wonderful.\nTHIS is the movie Mel Gibson's \"Ransom\" wishes it had been. something real and human and meaningful instead of merely kick-ass. I was gripped by this film from start to end.",

            "content": "This movie was pretty great.  The first half of the movie was far superior to the second half, which was  the investigation as to who was the kidnapper.  The thing is Toshiro Mifune has such a powerful on screen presence, that when he disappears in the second half, the movie just sort of falters without him.  The movie is still good, but I enjoyed the segments in Gondo's house and how Gondo struggles with whether or not to pay the ransom.  It was actually a really interesting twist to the usual hostage movie.  And again, Toshiro has such a presence on screen, so while he may not be the best actor, you can't help but pay attention to ANYTHING he does.  And the actors who portray the detectives just don't have that presence, so when the movie's second half relies on these detectives, the movie's just not as good.  But as it stands, the movie is still very interesting and very smart piece of work.  I like the portrayal of the separation between the upper and lower class.  Visually, it's a very OBVIOUS metaphor with Gondo's house on top looking down at the poorer houses, but it's very effective and it creates a situation where it could be ANYONE who's trying to extort Gondo.  The last scene was also very strong, with the villain revealing his motivations.  Here's also the thing with this movie.  The ending, seems, to be flat because having been conditioned to expect ridiculous twists, you expect EVERY movie to have a twist.  So it's insanely refreshing (if such a thing makes sense when this movie is almost FIFTY years old) when you see a movie such as this, where the movie just ends.  There's no \"Hey...Gondo did this himself to raise his own standing with the public\", which was a theory I was throwing around.  It wouldn't have made one lick of sense, but it was a theory I was throwing around.  Just the way the main detective was like \"Let's do this for Mr. Gondo because he's suffering\" or variating statements.  He did this every couple of scenes, to the point where I thought Gondo himself did it.  But no, the story ends up making sense in the end.  No silliness.  Anyway, this may not be Kurosawa's finest film, it's still an excellent movie that I recommend.",

            "content": "A film of three thirds. The first third, taking up an hour or so, easily ranks among Kurosawa's best dramas. Toshiro Mifune dominates the screen, as always, but this time playing not a samurai or a cop but Mr. Gondo, a shoe salesman taking the biggest financial risk of his career. Taking out loans against his entire fortune, he plans to buy up the majority of his company and finally make the quality shoes he's been dreaming of for 30 years. Then the phone rings.\n\nAn anonymous kidnapper demands 30 million yen for the safe return of his son. Mifune breaks down and is willing to pay anything, giving up his entire fortune in the process. And then his son walks in. The kidnapper grabbed his Chauffeur's son instead, but still insists on 30 million yen. Gondo must decide whether to sacrifice himself for the safety of the boy. The tensions rise as each family member makes his or her case, but the final decision rests with Gondo alone.\n\nThe second portion can't possibly live up the the first, but it does a damn fine job of trying. After delivering the money, Mr Gondo mostly sits out the film as the police force desperately tries to recover the stolen money and catch the psychopath before he can get away clean. Among police procedurals, this hour ranks pretty highly. The clues slowly start to add up and narrow down the suspects, but not without a few setbacks along the way.\n\nThe third part takes up a mere twenty minutes and could use some trimming. The police discover the kidnapper among the internship at a local hospital, with a flat within sight of Gondo's mansion. They follow him to a nightclub hoping to catch the kidnapper buying a lethal dose of heroin to finish off his druggie accomplices. Several minutes from the nightclub could easily have been cut, but the final scene between Gondo and the intern makes the entire chase worth the wait. So much goes unsaid between the two men that I'm sure I missed something. The pure performance in this scene conveys so much that words couldn't. The motive is understood by both men but not stated bluntly. An excellent ending to yet another Kurosawa masterpiece!",

The title corresponds to the film's two halves (a catch-22 ransom situation and a police procedural), which are distinct yet form two halves of a hell of an impressive whole.  As usual, Kurosawa takes the material of the genre much, much further than most storytellers, and the result is a movie that still feels more original fifty years later than newer, much less ambitious work.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to tear apart bad and awful films, but much harder to praise in minute detail incredible films that have the power to deeply affect you.  A fair number of Kurosawa's films do that for me, as they exploit the tools of the medium to its fullest effect for a thrilling, moving experience that defies words.  One sequence in particular, the Junkie Alley scene (did Spike borrow a little bit from it for Jungle Fever?) is incredibly sad, moving, and yet Kurosawa doesn't give in to sentimentality and keeps his plot on track regardless.  To evoke such a feeling from the material rather than arrange the material to evoke the feeling, and to do it well, is what Kurosawa excels at, and one reason among many that amongst the venerated giants of filmmaking, he really was the real deal.\r\n\r\nYet still, I find myself hard pressed to describe this film at length, so I'll end the review as I began.

And, high or low, each socioeconomic tier bears its own special brand of misery.\n\n\"High and Low\" (or alternatively \"Heaven and Hell\") is certainly filmed well by Kurosawa; he visualizes the underlying themes beautifully. Example: The chauffeur, representative of the working class, is constantly haunched over, eyes groundward, a posture that drips with the emotions of helplessness and despair that Kurosawa wants to bear down so heavily upon viewers. \n\nBut a major portion of kudos is due to the underlying novel by Ed McBain. McBain authored well a lot of high drama, such as \"Blackboard Jungle\" as well as the screenplay for Hitchcock's \"The Birds.\" And it's that drama, as much as Kurosawa's camerawork, that is captivating viewers herein.\n\nThe film does play out in two very distinct acts, acts that feel as though they are almost two different films.\n\nAct I is inside the isolated, pinnacled home of wealthy shoe executive Mifune, as he wrestles with his dilemma, whether to complete his buyout of the shoe company, thereby saving his own job, be positioned to run the company as it ought be run, and preserve the workers and their jobs in the long-term. Or to use the money to pay the ransom for the kidnapped child not his own -  and to ruin himself and let the company fall in the process. Living high, you see, comes with the responsibilities of both modeling appropriate behavior for the rest of society ... as well as acting to ensure its preservation.\n\nAct II is excellent pure police procedural, clever work tracking down the kidnapper after the child safely returns home, peppered with occasional glances back at Mifune, to see how his Act I decision has affected him and his family. It is in this act that the viewer gets the up-close look-see at the sufferings and dilemmas of those who live at the other economic end of society. \n\nBy deep into Act II, viewers are almost sympathetic to the poverty of the kidnapper living in the slums below the windows of Mifune's mansion ... until the kidnapper takes a stroll down Yokohama's Heroin Alley, looking to victimize a nameless, souless, empty-eyed addict as part of his scheming. And by the time viewers walk down that alley with him, they will be finding it quite unclear as to who, of all of these characters, is really the worse off among them. \n\nWatching Mifune wrestle ... and coppers chip away at the crime ... is plenty tasty enough. But watching how those living high, low and inbetween stuggle to survive within their places in society, well that's really the best part of this feast.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Without reservation.",

            "content": "Toshiro Mifune really shows his talents in High and Low.  He plays Kingo Gondo, a millionaire who is the executive of a shoe company.  The moment we see Gondo we feel his strength and importance.  Nothing is going to shake this man, he goes by his own rules and no one else's.  Unfortunately, that's just not the case when someone kidnaps his chauffeur's son, even though he meant to kidnap Gondo's son.  Kurosawa takes his time in each scene, building up the characters and the situations.  It really makes the two biggest payoffs feel well deserved.  The tension keeps building and building, but he never really lets his grasp from the audience loose.  Gondo has chosen to invest 50 million in stocks so that he can run the company and move things in a different direction.  He has risked everything for this opportunity.  When he first thinks his son has been kidnapped he freaks out and says he will raise the 30 million that has been requested and will take care of things, but the moment he finds out it's not his son he has to question whether or not it's worth paying the ransom.  I mean, it's everything he has worked for, and it's just the chauffeur's son, so is it really worth going broke for him?  He could keep the money and hope the kidnapper is just bluffing, or he can save the boy's life.  This is really the first time sociological questions come in to play, and they don't leave throughout the rest of the film.  We see that Gondo's home is placed at the top of a hill, and everyone below him is living close to poverty.  They have to look at that all the time, imagining what it would be like in that family's position.  It's really the physical division of rich and poor.  When Gondo says he can't give the money to save the boy his wife gets mad, but he points out to her that she has been rich and spoiled her whole life; she could never understand what she would be giving up by giving away that 30 million.\n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nReally, halfway through the film we get our first spoiler.  Gondo decides to pay the money, so he goes through everything and pays the kidnapper to get the boy back.  The majority of the rest of the film follows the police trying to find out who the kidnapper was, then getting him on charges that will keep him in prison for the rest of his life (or hang him).  I found this to be a little silly, but still entertaining, seeing as the group that is tailing the kidnapper go together in groups.  Maybe it's too many recent films, but wouldn't he have gotten suspicious pretty quick?  It really doesn't ruin the movie because you could come up with plenty of reasons.  Tailing the kidnapper leads the police through the poorer region of the same city that Gondo lives.  The club where he gets the drugs is crowded and hot.  Then there is a specific place that holds all the junkies.  In here we see a woman who is having withdrawals, and the kidnapper takes her to test the heroin to make sure it is pure enough to kill her.  I think the sickest part of this is seeing the police talk to each other like they know they are heading towards junkie central and they know they are about to head to a whore house.  They're poor, who cares?  The capture of the kidnapper is a little underwhelming, but that's because Kurosawa is saving the best punch for last.  Gondo is told the next day that the police retrieved the money except for 20,000 which was spent on the heroin, and while they are telling him the good news Gondo is getting all of his things repossessed.  He is embarrassed, but his family will make it.  The kidnapper requests to see Gondo and he agrees, and basically we discover that he did it simply because he was tired of looking at his nice house on the hill while everyone suffered.  During this scene there is a reflection on the mirror, pretty much showing that they are both feeling some of the same things; they are man, they are similar.  The kidnapper says the poor like to see the rich go through pain too.  I expected the kidnapper to be tied in with the men at the company who wanted Gondo out, so it was surprising to hear the connection wasn't there.  I think that's the strongest punch of them all.  Kurosawa leaves his audience thinking about sociological differences while entertaining them to no ends with a brilliantly crafted crime story.",

            "content": "As is true in society, this movie demonstrates that the womenâs shoe industry is a dangerous place.  Our hero, who is planning on taking control over the shoe company he works for through some pretty slick negotiations, must put that plan on hold when his son is kidnapped for 30 million yen.  Then the plan is back on when he realizes the kidnapper made off with his chaufferâs kid, not his own.  False alarm, guys.  Except here comes the morality bit (and the filmâs strongest third) in that we have to ask how valuable the life of a human is.  Ten minutes ago, Mifune was ready to pay the ransom despite the fact it would bankrupt him.  But when the victim isnât his own flesh and blood, he starts to ease up.  Dramatics and interesting staging make the apartment where the entire first 42 minutes take place the best part, with Mifune being Mifune (but wearing a shirt this time) and the police assigned to the job trying to track the kidnapper via phone conversations.  The wheels start to come off when we shift to Mifune paying the ransom in a very clever train sequence.  After that, our focus is with the police trying to figure out who did this (we find out pretty quickly) and why (thatâs a bit tougher).  Youâll be forgiven for thinking youâve wandered into a second movie on your DVD by mistake.  But then the last third starts and we follow the kidnapper through the drug-infested lower depths of Japanese culture in the 1960s (read: drugs, dancing and making drug deals while dancing).  What should be exciting and engaging is dull, repetitive and downright heavy handed on a symbolic level.  Kurosawaâs better than this, sure, but when weâre constantly reminded of the âhighâ and âlowâ of the title (Mifune lives atop a hill, high above the poor citizens, the street-level drug-laced culture is a living hell, etc.), itâs not exactly thought provoking anymore.  Then again, this was adapted from a book I havenât read, so maybe itâs even worse in the book and Kurosawa smoothed out the blatant symbolism.  No idea.  But if youâre out to tear through all the Kurosawa-Mifune collaborations, this is one that can wait.",

That especially goes for this modern neo noir thriller starring Toshiro Mifune as  high ranking shoe executive, Kingo Gondo who makes a play for controlling shares of the company because he shares the founder's vision of quality over quantity. His rivals want to make higher quantities of shoddy made shoes. While this struggle is taking place a man kidnaps the son of Gondo's chauffeur who the kidnapper mistakes for Gondo's son. Upon learning the mistake he made the kidnapper still demands the same ransom for his chauffeur's son knowing Gondo won't let the child die. The first half of the film deals with Gondo's moral dilemma and the second half deals with the dragnet put up by Inspector Tokura(Nakadai) and his police squad to bring the kidnapper to justice.",

The first, dedicated to Mifune's stern self made business man split between the decision to spend his fortune saving his chauffer's son.  The second part is dedicated to the police search.  Although Kurosawa meant a nod towards film noir, the movie sides less with solo-detective banter and investigation and instead sprawls a careful and concise city wide investigation.  The detail unravels slowly, and the suspense keeps us hanging, but underneath it all is the consistently present question of who we should be rooting for, and what bigger issues are at play behind the crime.

While it's his own kid that is the intended target, the napped one ends up being the son of his driver. The kidnapper realizes this, but poses the same ransom regardless. Now the shoe exec has to decide to break his family or let the boy die. This hour is where I degraded my rating a bit. The dilemma is hardly an even trade and it seems false to build a dialogue around it, where all the exec's underlings can placate his wavering integrity.\r\n\r\nRegardless of his deceision, the police still get to spend the rest of the movie hunting for the kidnapper/maybe-child killer. This is where Kurosawa really excels. Remember, this is 1963 Japanese standards, so it's actually quite amazing to see actual footwork and logic carry the story out instead of the usual computer-simulation recreation of events. It doesn't delve into the family issues of the lead investigator; it doesn't feign some secret conspiracy sub-plot- it just goes by the numbers for a large group of men doing a job to piece clues together to single out a individual(s).\r\n\r\nThe direction and acting are very purposeful and exacting without getting over-flashy or stylinsh, for the most part. The exception to this comes when we follow a suspect through the drug dins of Japan to see how a rock and roll dance becomes a very romantic heroin purchase. This is followed by an almost Salvadore Dali-surrealist walk through an addict maze. It's very dark and disturbing and points to the ugliness of our kidnapper in a way that we hadn't seen otherwise.\r\n\r\nTo that end, we get very little of the perpetrator(s) of the crime. The motive, the demeamor, for example. This comes through in the ending with great results. The direction in these scenes is such that we see victims and victimisors reflected within each other.

            "content": "Based on King's Ransom, a crime novel by Ed McBain, High and Low (Tengoku to Jigoku) stars Toshiro Mifune as Kingo Gondo, a wealthy, hardworking businessman who owns a certain percentage of a shoe company that has seen better days. As Gondo plans a move that will secure his position as the head of his company, he is contacted by a mysterious man who informs him that he has kidnapped his son. The crook demands a high ransom - one that is so huge it will bankrupt him. As Gondo is prepared to pay the ransom, he discovers that his son is actually safe at home and the kidnappers have mistakenly kidnapped the chauffeur's son. As quick as he was to pay off the man for his son, he is reluctant to pay him off for the son of the chauffeur and the question quickly becomes: does Gondo abandon his plans to pay off the man or does he do the honorable thing and help save his driver's son? This moral dilemma is what drives the first half of Akira Kurosawa's thriller which mainly takes place in the spacious living room inside of the Gondo residence full of long takes and a tour de force of acting and directing. The second half however is mainly set in the cramped confines of the city where the kidnapper hides from the police investigation led by the Inspector Tokura, played by Tatsuya Nakadai. The investigation scenes are done with great attention to detail and for the most part are very fast paced, compared to the long takes of the first half. Scenes that come to mind are when the kidnapper is being followed through out the city into a club where there is a crowd of people dancing around and where an exchange of money and drugs is thought to happen. The police, in disguises, follow the kidnapper into a place where many drug addicts are located waiting for a chance to score and soon after finding a dead woman overdosed off of pure heroin the men go back into the streets where the kidnapper is seen by Inspector Tokura and his men in the car speaking with Gondo although Gondo has absolutely no idea that this is the man they are looking for. This scene is one of the scenes where it shows just how much of a fan Kurosawa must have been of film noir. The film ends with the kidnapper confronting with Gondo while being locked up.\n\nWhile it may or may not be one of his true master works it is a fine example of Japanese film noir. It is helped by a fantastic cast that includes Kurosawa regulars Toshiro Mifune, Tatsuya Nakadai, Takashi Shimura and Susumu Fujita. It has great camera work and while the first act is done mostly with long takes, the second and third acts have fabulous editing that give the film suspense and energy. The acting during the scenes in the Gondo residence, along with the police procedurals of the second act and the conclusion of the kidnapper confronting Gondo all adds up to one of the best detective films ever made. Not many Hollywood movies in the genre can compare to it. Just a great film to watch and a must see for fans of film noir and of course the usual Kurosawa fans. 10/10",

Mifune played yet another character-type in this film since his character is very firm, but mostly reactive to other people's decisions. He's very stoic in most of the film, which is unusual to see from him. Tatsuya Nakadai also played a very different character than I'm used to seeing from him, along the same lines as Mifune's. I love the way the detectives work in this film.

            "content": "The title of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 noir thriller \"High and Low\" is both a reflection of the setting in which much of the action takes place in, as well as a portrait of the class boundaries separating the industrial slums from the mansion that rests atop a hill. The film stars the longtime Kurosawa mainstay Toshiro Mifune (Takashi Shimura turns up as well, but in a much smaller roll), and it is arguably Kurosawa's best non-period piece.\n\nKingo Gondo (Toshiro Mifune) is a top level executive at the National Shoe Company, which is in the process of a huge reform to maximize profitability. Although his associates are fine with producing less-than-stellar products, Gondo takes a great pride in his shoes and angrily rejects. Fearing the future of the company in their hands, he plans to become the majority shareholder and keep the NSC from producing poor footwear.\n\nAfter mortgaging everything and arranging a big business deal, Gondo gets a call at home saying that his son, Jun (Toshio Egi), was kidnapped. In actuality, Jun was mistaken for Shinichi (Masahiko Shimazu), the son of Aoki (Yutaka Sada), Gondo's chauffeur. Although Gondo was willing to give up his money to protect the life of his own son, he recklessly calls the police (despite the kidnappers saying police involvement will lead to the death of the boy) and refuses to pay for Shinichi's life. \n\nThe police and Gondo eventually set up a foolproof method of catching the criminals while delivering the ransom money, but they are fooled. Shinichi is back in the hands of his father, but the rest of the film follows the police's pursuit of the kidnapper and Gondo's fortune.\n\nThe first half of the film, dealing with Gondo and the kidnappers, is simply brilliant. Gondo's apartment is filled with a number of people, and each actor plays their roles wonderfully. Gondo's wife chastises Gondo for not saving Shinichi, and Aoki lingers in the backdrop as a nervous and pathetic wreck. When the story shifts to the slums and the cat-and-mouse chase between the cops and the kidnapper, it becomes more of a standard police procedural - however the perfectly realized drug and prostitution culture make it never less than fascinating to look at.\n\nAlthough the second half of \"High and Low\" doesn't reach the brilliance of the first, it's nevertheless a wonderful thriller that criticizes the cruelty of capitalism in a creative and new fashion.",

He is trying to stop his shareholder colleagues from making shoddy shoes. Then his son is kidnapped, and after some unfolding events it turns into a fascinating morality tale.\n\nAfter the tense build up of the ransom and drop, the investigation continues as the police use every method possible to catch the kidnapper. The movie has a slow pace, but an incredible absorbing feel to it. Its almost as if you're in the room with them as they utilize clues and testimonies.\n\nThe movie ends with a final confrontation full of tension. The kidnapper's mirrored sunglasses are used to full effect, and its filmmaking at its absolute finest. Akira Kurosawa makes a tense and methodical crime thriller that explores the depravity, morality, and integrity of human nature.",

            "content": "Un chef d'oeuvre de film policier, magnifiquement orchestre par Akira Kurosawa. Le scenario d'\"Entre le Ciel et l'Enfer\", inspire d'un roman americain (\"Rancon sur un theme mineur\" d'Ed McBain), est demoniaque : Gondo (Toshiro Mifune), un businessman japonais parti de rien, qui a gravi bareau par bareau l'echelle sociale, est en passe de realiser l'affaire de sa vie, en hypothequant ses biens pour racheter la fabrique de chaussures qui l'emploie, quand un homme lui annonce par telephone qu'il a kidnappe son fils... mais il y a eu meprise : l'enfant capture est en fait le fils de son chauffeur. Une rancon est exigee et Gondo devra choisir entre la vie du garcon et sa propre ruine... la premiere heure du film peut derouter car Kurosawa fait le choix radical du huis-clos et de l'unite de lieu. Tout se deroule dans la maison de Gondo, facon \"theatre filme\" (les rideaux sur la grande baie vitree sont fermes, puis ouverts, comme sur une scene). Le realisateur joue sur le hors-champ et le positionnement des personnages qui apparaissent puis disparaissent du cadre. Ils se croisent, echangent leurs places, dans une etrange choregraphie, ronges par le stress, guettant avec anxiete chaque nouveau coup de fil du kidnappeur. Ce huis-clos etouffant nous fait violemment ressentir le dilemme vecu par Gondo, les sentiments contradictoires qui l'animent... Toshiro Mifune livre d'ailleurs dans cette premiere partie du film un numero d'acteur epatant. Puis Kurosawa opere une rupture nette, avec une superbe sequence de remise de rancon dans un train filant a toute allure, camera subjective a l'epaule, montage cisele. Les silhouettes furtives des kidnappeurs postes au bord de la voie ferree, apercus derriere les vitres des wagons, accentue l'angoisse, le sentiment d'impuissance.... c'est le climax du film. Puis la police entre en jeu. Kurosawa restitue son enquete de facon tres posee, en rassemblant avec application chaque piece du puzzle, jusqu'au denouement final. Paradoxalement, plus les flics progressent, plus la lumiere faiblit. L'obscurite finit par s'imposer dans la poursuite finale dans les bas-fonds de Yokohama ou l'on croise les silhouettes fantomatiques des toxicomanes, des prostituees... les laisses pour compte de l'essor economique japonais. A travers ce film, Kurosawa nous questionne effectivement sur le sens de la reussite economique, individuelle et collective, sans jamais se poser en moralisateur car il se garde bien d'apporter une reponse toute faite... il nous laisse reflechir, seuls, comme Gondo a la fin du film, dans un dernier plan sublime. Mike Nichols, le realisateur du \"Laureat\",  preparerait un remake hollywoodien d'\"Entre le Ciel et l'Enfer\" pour le compte de Miramax, reprenant un projet d'adaptation initie puis abandonne par Martin Scorsese. Je lui souhaite bon courage, car la barre est haute. Tres haute.",

            "content": "Kurosawa was long, and accurately, considered the most Westernized of Japanese directors.  Seldom is it more evident than here, in [i]Tengoku to jigoku[/i] (literally translates to \"Heaven and Hell\"), which is actually genuinely based on an American mystery novel.  I must admit that I've never read an Ed McBain novel, though I may have to start here.  This movie is based on the novel [i]King's Ransom[/i], though I have no idea, obviously, how closely.  Of course, Kurosawa has transferred the whole thing to Japan, as I'm not sure he ever set anything anywhere else.  He even works in that most Japanese of landmarks, Mount Fuji.  He works in the bullet train.  This is a very Japanese version of a very American story, and I think perhaps only Kurosawa was capable of doing that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nKingo Gondo (Toshirô Mifune, of course) is an executive at the National Shoe Company.  The other executives want to take over the company and make poor-quality shoes which will sell more and sell quickly, because they will wear out.  Gondo wants to make good shoes, which will not sell as often but will be worth the price.  He has slowly been buying up stock so that he will have enough to take over the company and run things his way.  However, he receives a phone call saying that his son, Jun (Toshio Egi), has been kidnapped.  However, it is not Jun.  Jun traded clothes with Shinichi Aoki (Masahiko Shamazu), the son of the chauffeur (Yutaka Sada), and the wrong boy has been taken.  Gondo must decide whether to pay the ransom as Aoki begs or to keep up with his plans of taking over the company, which has tied up all of his money.\r\n\r\nWhat I find interesting about the story is how beloved Gondo is by the actual workers of the factory.  The other executives?  Not so fond.  In fact, the workers suggest to the detectives that the executives might be behind the kidnapping.  They themselves wish to help find the missing boy, and public support, once the story is out, is all behind Gondo, and the rest of the executives are shamed.  Women, in fact, are said to be boycotting National Shoes.  This does not stop the machinations, of course, but Gondo is seen as almost saintly in his treatment of workers, consumers, and company.  The detectives, who are just doing their jobs, seem to like him as well, and Aoki assumes almost without considering the issue that Gondo will pay his son's ransom.\r\n\r\nI also like that Kurosawa chooses to show us Gondo's hesitance.  (It also delights me that the author of the original book is credited, in the Japanese, as \"Edo Makubein.\")  Gondo genuinely wants to help Aoki, of whom he is clearly fond.  Certainly Jun and Shinichi are shown to be real friends.  However, Gondo has everything tied up in this deal.  The stock is going to cost him 150 million yen.  He has leveraged [i]everything[/i].  To pay the ransom will take the 50 million yen that is to be his down payment.  Not only will the deal fall through, he will be wiped out.  In fact, Aoki will lose his job--but Aoki cares far less about his job than he does his son, obviously.  Gondo's choice will change things for an enormous number of people, and Kurosawa makes us feel that choice.\r\n\r\nThis is not Kurosawa's best work.  I'm still holding out judgement as to what will be, as there are several important ones we haven't gotten to yet and won't for some time.  (We're only on \"H,\" after all, and two of the most famous ones start with \"R\"!)  However, as with some other directors, even his substandard works are better than the best works of several other directors, and not just your Uwe Bolls and your Michael Bays.  And that right there?  That's the only time you'll see me compare Akira Kurosawa with Uwe Boll and Michael Bay.",

Meanwhile, edge of your seat suspense, tension and drama is heighted by what is NOT being said between characters. Kurosawa's choice of changing the POV from Gondo to Det. Tokura and finally to the kidnapper himself, is bold, risky and masterfully pulled off. This gives us glimpses into each lead's mindset with the two most important being Gondo in his desire to cement a secure future for his family, and the envy driving Ginjirô Takeuchi to his crime. Both Gondo and Takeuchi represent the same demographic, and Kurosawa uses these characters to represent the point that we are all the subjects of our environments, and given the right (or wrong) circumstances, we are all capable of unthinkable deeds. This point reaches its dramatic apex in the final scene as Gondo sits across from Takeuchi; with each cut, Kurosawa brings the prior's reflection ever closer to the latter's until, finally, both faces overlap. ...Chillingly brilliant.",

Commenting on the upper, middle, and lower class of the Americanized country, the film's real brilliance lies in, of course, the cinematography.  Kurosawa was a trained painter and he easily translates his wonderful sense of style to film by using widescreen.  Rarely do I see films where the entire frame is being used in such a grand, yet personal way.  \r\n\r\nEverything in this film works really well except when the cops decide to go on a manhunt so they can sentence capital punishment to the \"kidnapper.\"  The film enters \"Hell\" and becomes surreal and horrific as we are shown zombie-like heroin addicts and a perpetrator who hides behind mirrored sunglasses.  While this sequence has some of the best photography of the entire film, I don't think it really captures that \"lower\" part of society that well.  Nevertheless, it still works for the most part in context with the rest of the film and doesn't detract fully from the overall experience.\r\n\r\n\"High and Low\" has wonderful messages throughout and all of the characters are complex and interesting.  When the \"bad guy\" screams at the end of the film we can't help but wonder if the \"protagonist\" doesn't feel the same way.  This is a beautiful film and I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Akira Kurosawa is associated with Samurai films a little too much, with the action extravaganza \"Seven Samurai\", the Macbeth-Kabuki Theatre fusion called \"Throne Of Blood\" and his Man-With-No-Name influencing duo of \"Yojimbo\" and \"Sanjuro\", it's not hard to see why this generalisation exists (Can't forget about \"Kagemusha\" and \"Ran\" made at the twilight of his career). But with his films, there was also a real compassion and sentiment which sometimes boiled over (see \"Ikiru\", a non-Samurai film), but when it didn't boil over, the results were particularly amazing. \n\nAfter his \"Yojimbo/Sanjuro\" double bill, Akira Kurosawa took on an Ed McBain novel, and made a fantastic crime thriller and one of the best police procedurals you'll ever see (It's a personal favourite of the Coen Brothers): \"High And Low\" (The literal meaning is \"Heaven And Hell\", but let's not get too picky).\n\nIt starts off (and stays for practically the entire first third of the film) in a large house overlooking the Downtown area of Tokyo. The owner of the house is Kingo Gondo (In another wonderful charismatic-yet-restrained performance by Toshiro Mifune). Kingo has worked his way up through his shoe company (a big deal in social circles in Japan) to the point where he can move enough money around to become the leading shareholder (the other shareholders want him out of the company because he doesn't want to make poor quality shoes for high sales). But before his deal to takeover the company can go through, he gets a phonecall saying that his son has been kidnapped, and to pay the ransom would leave him financially ruined. But there's a twist: The kidnappers took his chauffeur's son instead, but the ransom remains the same. Will Kingo ruin himself financially to save the life of a child who isn't his?\n\nThe second half of the film involves the Police's attempts to find out who the kidnapper was. It's a nice shift from the claustrophobic living room of the first third, into the real world where the Police use all their manpower to figure out every single detail. The procedure is done in a meticulous style that is often missing from crime thrillers made today, as the Police Chief narrow down their targets until they believe they've found their man. But a simple kidnapping charge isn't enough, they want him to hang.\n\nKurosawa's camera manages to capture the spotless veneer of the businessman's appartment, and can contrast it with the dirty stench that permeates throughout the Downtown area of Tokyo, as the areas of \"Heaven & Hell\" are clearly delineated geographically. The performances are wonderful from everyone, particularly Toshiro Mifune and Tatsuya Nakadai as the Police Inspector. It's a fantastic crime drama that lets the plot unravel at its own pace, the Police slowly piecing together the criminal's every step before zeroing in on their man. The ending shows the chasm between Heaven & Hell, and Kurosawa informs that the only way to reach Heaven is to do things the honourable way.",

It starts out as a gripping abduction film with a unique moral twist-- the opening scene of the National Shoes executives reminded me of [i]Ran[/i] -- before warping into an exhaustively detailed procedural that would certainly impress[i] Zodiac[/i] helmer David Fincher. The end result is a sprawling crime drama, easily one of Kurosawa's masterpieces.[/color][/font]\n \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]He has a defnite feel and natural observation for his characters, and it's no different here. The sheer complexity of the film, either in its first of second half, is enough to warrant keeping notes -- it's a brilliant script as always.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[img]http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/10/29/kobal_highandlow460.jpg[/img]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]Another thing I really noticed here -- perhaps its the 2.35 aspect ratio on the Criterion disc I watched -- is that Kurosawa really manages his widescreen angles beautifully. He can get almost every character in the same shot, utilizing the foreground as well as the background advantageously. It allows less cutting, longer takes, higher drama and another thing I really enjoyed -- very little close-ups. [/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]I keep hearing people knock Toshiro Mifune on these journals, but the guy continues to impress me endlessly. He had the best performance in [i]Seven Samurai[/i], and although his screen time here is very minimal outside of the first hour, he makes it count.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][i]High and Low[/i] was certainly a delightful surprise, as I had little interest in seeing it. The switch from abduction film to procedural got me on the edge of my seat and it's fun to think about the different and multiple meaning of the film's title. Do check it out if you haven't seen it.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]([i]'Ikiru' [/i] Kurosawa, Akira; 1952)[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]I literally just finished watching [i]Ikiru,[/i] and it's definitely Kurosawa's most seemingly personal and strange film that I've seen from him so far. Essentially about the quest for fulfillment of one man, Watanabe (the always great Takashi Shimura), before his inevitable death of stomach cancer, it's the kind of film that feels like as mysterious and masterful as Orson Welles' [i]Citizen Kane[/i], while coming up just short.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]I liked the majority of the first 90 minutes or so -- which can be easily seperated from the final 60 -- but a few things didn't completely work. First off, Watanabe's dialogue feels overwritten. I get that he's supposed to be a stumbling, inconcise kind of guy, but why does he have to say, \"in other words\" every time he feels like he needs to clarify himself? Unless this is a mistake by the Criterion english subtitles, it's doesn't feel natural.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]Secondly, Watanabe's quest for a purpose in last remaining 6 months has its hits (his relationship with a young female ex-co worker) and misses (a night on the town with a friend who feels pity for the sickly city official). Obviously, the entire sequence is well-shot, as is the entirety of the film, but it struck me as an unnecessarily lenghty detour.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[img]http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/07/04/Ikiru_460.jpg[/img]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]However, the final 50 minutes or so of [i]Ikiru[/i] is easily the best stretch of film-making I've seen from Kurosawa -- I'm talking brilliant. Every frame is full of redemption and hope as Watanabe's co-workers sit around his wake, piecing his life together that was a mystery even to his only son. Some of the attendees are touched, some unmoved, some so drunk that they act influenced by his final moments, but have clearly proven these remarks to be hollow when back at work in the very next scene.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]In the end, the result is, even with a few flaws, one of Kurosawa's more deeply-felt masterpieces. With [i]Seven Samurai, High and Low [/i]and[i] Ikiru[/i], he has as extensive and diverse a body of work with just those three films than most directors could ever even hope for -- I can't wait to watch some more.[/color][/font]\n[font=Georgia][color=#000000][/color][/font] \n[font=Georgia][color=#000000]By the way, for those of you who fancy yourselves Kurosawa experts (ryanator), do you remember that final scene with the park and the bridge? Didn't that look like the exact same bridge with the polluted river running under it that was featured so prominently in [i]Drunken Angel[/i]? I could be imagining it, but it seemed like the exact same location to me.[/color][/font]",

This film reminds me a lot of Ransom (or should I say Ransom reminds me a lot of this) in that same feeling of high society versus low. Usually it seems that the wealthy are depicted as corrupt and the impoverished as the victim or underdog, and its interesting to see the reverse side.  I think Ransom is better in its pacing and handling of the suspense, in High and Low the transition from the executives conversation to the ransom call seemed a bit strange to me. \r\n\r\nThe primary difference I think between the two films is that Ransom uses the plot to tell the story in an exciting and suspensful way; Kurosawa seems to use it more as a social commentary on Reconstructed Japan. But what is Kurosawa trying to say with this film? That the rich can be moral too? That sacrifice does not go unrepaid? Is he simply showing the stark contrast of living between the two sects of society? I'm not entirely sure, but its still a pretty cool ransom flick.",

Oh, and a twist, Matthew Fox's character is a terrorist, yet he is assigned to guard the President of the United States.  Man, that would make his job easy[img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/rolleyes.gif[/img].  Also, Secret Service would never discharge their weapons in a crowd of people like they did unless there was immediate danger.

With a great start, a 15-20 minute lull, and a super ending, it was hardly a chore, yet at the same time, I think some scenes could have easily been cut down to make this 120 minutes instead of 140 minutes.  I'm sorry, but the only reason a film should be over 2 hours is if the movie has more to say and can go the whole runtime without dragging.  I actually watched this over two sittings because during the lull, I had to take a break for a while.  Looking back, if I had known the film was going to finish as strong as it did, I would have finished it in one sitting.\n\n[img]http://cache.boston.com/resize/bonzai-fba/Globe_Photo/2008/07/31/1217549316_8622/539w.jpg[/img]\n\nUntil next time....\n[/center]",
