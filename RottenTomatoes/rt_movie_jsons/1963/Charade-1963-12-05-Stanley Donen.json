    "summary": "After Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) falls for the dashing Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) on a skiing holiday in the French Alps, she discovers upon her return to Paris that her husband has been murdered. Soon, she and Peter are giving chase to three of her late husband's World War II cronies, Tex (James Coburn), Scobie (George Kennedy) and Gideon (Ned Glass), who are after a quarter of a million dollars the quartet stole while behind enemy lines. But why does Peter keep changing his name?",

Too bad there are very few such masterpieces made in the Hollywood of today!  Also the movie is very underplayed -- no loud music that cues the audience when to laugh, when to cry or when to ooh and aah. Grant and Hepburn have some great comedy scenes but as I said, low key,  not overdramatized. Also the script does not paint Grant as an older Lothario -- he is portrayed realistically as an older guy who admits as much. Walter Matthau also a stand out. All the character roles are done well. Great shots of Paris.\n   Whenever I watch the movie I think it's like a Hitchcock. Certainly in the same class as the best Hitchcocks.",

I was enchanted as always by the chic and lovely Audrey Hepburn who is as bright and charming as ever here as she dashes about Paris, running from the former soldiers who knew her suddenly dead husband and who simultaneously falls under the spell of protective stranger superstar Cary Grant - or is the doting Grant just after the beautiful young widow's dough? Every scene is a gem and Paris makes a fabulous backdrop for the stylish thriller that is non-stop romance, action and wit. I've walked those Parisian streets, rode the Metro and visited that very  colonnade; I swoon over Audrey's chic apartment near the start of the film. The ending of \"Charade\" when all comes to a menacing climax still gives me chills.",

The premise is that a man thrown from a train left a 'treasure' of $250,000 and the race to find it first is on for his wife, three friends/thugs and a mysterious 'extra' man who changes his identity as the story progresses. Sounds intriguing enough. Unfortunately, Audrey Hepburn as the wife minces through the film half the time wide-eyed and oh-so-cutely befuddled and the other half braying/screaming at finding another brutally murdered body. Cary Grant as the mystery man looks like he is wincing at the lines he has to say and has difficulty shifting roles from possible cold-hearted killer to romantic interest. Chemistry?! Again, the film can't make up its mind. Is Cary too old for Audrey (59 to her 34) and attempting not to be attracted or are they lusting after each other (all the sexless pecking leads me to believe neither has the slightest physical interest in the other). Audrey models her clothes well and can wear a hat shaped like half a golf ball like nobody else but this film makes me wonder if she ever had more to offer than her chic good looks to begin with and Cary must have just decided to make some \"jam\" money as he called it.

And, although the final product may not be entirely even all around, it's an absolutely valid effort from a tonal standpoint. Let's not kid ourselves here, however. You came here for the all-star cast, but you're going to stay for the bendy, twisty, and malleable caper narrative in play. I love it when movies get cute with the plot like this. Sure, some of it is predictable, but I'll always feel better when a writer or director feels they have to escalate what they're doing from scene to scene, whether that's with the action, the visuals, or -- in this case -- the plot elements. No character is who they seem to be and the audience's understandings of these characters are constantly pushed, pulled, and poked at, always giving us something to doubt, consider, or simply think about.

The film is often called the best film that wasn't directed by Hitchcock, and yes, it does seem like a homage to the films of Alfred Hitchcock, complete with Cary Grant.  Audrey Hepburn plays Regina Lampert, an American woman musing over leaving her husband.  That decision becomes easier when she arrives home to her apartment in Paris to find everything missing and a police investigator there to inform her her husband has been murdered.  The police investigator interrogates her about Charles and she admits she knows so little about him.\nThe funeral service is sparce, only her friend Sylvie (Dominique Minot) and the charming stranger Brian Cruikshank (Cary Grant) attend.  Later three mysterious men appear at the funeral shocked to see Charles is dead.   After the funeral she is approached by CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholomew (Walter Mathau) who informs her that she has $200,000 that she doesn't know anything about that those three men are after.   Charles and those men, along with a fifth man named Carson Dyle, were given $200,000 in gold to give to the French Resistance, but they stole it instead.  Carson was shot and left for dead, and Charles double-crossed the others.\nWhat happens next is a series of deaths and people are not who they say they are.  What is absolutely clear to Regina is she is unsure as to trust Brian and as the viewer we're unsure, too.  They fight and work together at times, and all Regina wants is for this ordeal to end fully cooperating with the three men and the CIA, who wants the money back.\nThis film is not at all predictable, it's fun.  It's a completely joyous suspense thriller romantic comedy.",

She trusts a rather suave but untrustworthy man using many different alias to keep her safe and crack the case.\nCharade is as 1960s as it gets. It has a corny, old atmosphere to it with overdone and sometimes unrealistic performances from Grant and Hepburn. Those two have questionable chemistry as they share the same emotion over and over, it seems all overdone and fake.

Can you imagine any other actress delivering her lines the same way and not getting raked over the coals for it? I don't think so.\nHepburn aside, Cary Grant remains one of my favorite actors to watch of all time and the wonderfully twisty turns of this screenplay always make this a joy to watch.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nCharade is the story about a clueless woman being pursued by three men in order to get the $250 000 they helped steal from the Americans.\n\nI remember watching this film a couple of years ago, as a friend recommended this film to me, saying that it was fantastic and thinking that I would share the same feeling. My first experience with the film was now vague in my memory, but I do recall feeling satisfied with what I just saw. Now, a couple of years later, I have decided to revisit the film again, possibly improving my feelings towards it. Sadly my feelings towards this actually worsened, but fortunately not by a lot.\n\nCharade's plot was definitely easy to follow, as the film doesn't spend too much time in making itself complicated, instead it places emphasis on the twists and turns it would take like as if we were being played with. Throughout most of the film, we feel almost exactly what Regina Lampert feels as both the character and the audience starts off with no clue on what is going on and it is only the information that was given to her that helps us gain an understanding on the intentions of the players in this game. I personally didn't have any problem with following the formula throughout the film as it is an interesting way in watching a film unfolds. The film certainly has its twists, and they are abundant. Approximately every 10-15 minutes there is a major turn that completely changes our perspective of the situation and I honestly found this to be very tiring, as it makes it hard to appreciate the plot and suspense that the film has built at the start; instead of the audience putting their focus on the cash, instead their attentions are diverted to the twist and trying to unscramble the thoughts and preconception of the situation that were caused by this sudden change. I adore a film that could keep me on my feet, but when it contradicts itself way too much one can't help but feel exhausted in investing themselves with the characters.\n\nI was truly disappointed with the characters in this film, as they felt quite hollow. It also felt like they were only tools in manipulating our emotions and to move the plot forward. It was very rare for me to care on what the character's feelings were. Our two lead characters were poorly developed at the start of the film, and they stayed that way until probably half way through the film when we have developed some sort of connection with the characters after all they have went through, therefore having something to kind latch ourselves onto. It would have been nice to gain some sort of history on the characters, even if it was executed through small pieces of dialogue during conversations. I personally feel when one doesn't have any characters to hold onto during a film, then the film's plot and narrative starts to be seen in an objective point of view and through this, cracks starts to appear and ultimately bring the film down.\n\nI personally felt that Charade was a parody of Hitchcock films, as I can see the small references that are scattered throughout the film; whether or not they are direct I cannot say. Just little nuggets like exploring the idea of spy/agents, the mislead of our idea of an important character, the witty comedic banter between the characters, individuals placed in a situation that they accidentally stumbled themselves onto, and the execution of the action set pieces particularly the rooftop scene, which clearly was a call to Hitchcock's Vertigo. These references were definitely a delight to watch and made the film more fun than the storytelling was trying to strive for. But throwbacks are not enough to carry the film throughout if the characters and plot lacked any sense of connection with the audience.\n\nThe film's tone was also a bit unbalanced for me as it seems to switch and forth between dramatic thriller and romantic comedy in a way that felt so polarising that going from scene to scene made me feel disoriented. Characters at one point during the film would feel a sense of danger, truly feeling threatened but the next scene would then switch to this North By Northwest kind of mindset where the characters are coming off as sarcastic almost to the point of not caring whether or not they would die. If the director had picked one tone to primarily carry this film and have others be buried only in specific moments throughout, then this would have been a much easier film to watch.\n\nThe film's photography was satisfying, with scenes creating that heightened sense of emotion that felt both stylish and subtle. I did enjoy the film's use of shadows, particularly during scenes of danger and threat as it just overcast on the characters in such a way that clearly throws back to the thrillers that has influenced the director, while at the same time ensuring scenes were executed that left audience in feeling both intrigued and threatened. The photography did at times go along with the dual tones of the director with some moments not matching with the scenes the preceded it, but is successful in amplifying the emotions of the scene that we are currently watching. I personally felt that this film would have benefited with a little more breathing room, as the film seems to be primarily confined within the apartments, leaving me feeling tired of seeing it, as actors have completely exhausted their use of the environment within the first hour of the film. It was delightful to see the location of Regina's occupation during the end of the second act, treating us to seeing something new while also building character development. The boat scenes at night that occurs half way through the film was gorgeous, and was something that stuck in my mind ever since my first viewing of this film. The film's score, composed by Henry Mancini, came onto me mostly in a positive light, as there were a couple of moments in the film that felt both original and a throwback to particular mystery/suspense films that influenced this film. The sound of the guitar and percussion instruments that came on during the title track was beautiful. The trumpets and violins that play throughout particular scenes were memorable and effective. This is not to say it's perfect as some moments felt a tad melodramatic, and some moments the score has incorporated the music as sound effects which made it at times cringe-worthy, particularly during a moment in the rooftop sequence.\n\nThe film's acting was truly disappointing. Cary Grant plays a man that is a toned down version of what he played on North By Northwest, and I thought it was definitely better than the performance that he brought to the Hitchcock film but it was still sometimes irritating to watch as he was still too cool for his own good, but at least here he has a reason to be. Audrey Hepburn was also disappointing in this film, as she was forced and melodramatic, as the scenes weren't all that shocking or that intense to begin with. I have seen her in much better roles like in Breakfast At Tiffany's and Sabrina, where almost each moment is a scene-stealer. The three \"antagonists\" of the film were over exaggerated and at times made me yawn when they rambled on.\n\nCharade is a film that left me split, sadly this wasn't the outcome that I wanted after seeing this, as it definitely has elements that worked or things that had the potential to be great but sadly failed in its execution. I guess only time will tell whether or not this would improve on me in the future.",

Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) has just returned from a holiday to her home in Paris to discover her husband Charlie cleared out the apartment, and that he's been found dead on the side of a railway track. However, Regina discovers Charlie had a double life, and he had his fair share of secrets in the past, and she's told by CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholomew (Walter Matthau) at the U.S. Embassy in Paris that 3 men, Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), Herman Scobie (George Kennedy), and Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass) are after money they stole during the way. Regina is helped by the mysterious Peter Joshua (Cary Grant), who has a few aliases. It's not a film to be taken seriously, but it's aided by a very good cast, and it has a lot of mystery and suspsense along the way, a lot of critics claim this is the best film Hitchcock never made, and they're right, it has the glamour, the suspense and the twists, only Donen got there first, and it's one of his best films to boot.",

Thanks in no small part to the talents of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, who have a fantastic chemistry together. This is the non-Hitchcock Hitchcock film. Grant was an older man by this time, yet still oozes suave charm and sharp wit; paired against the gorgeous Hepburn who's comedic chops weren't exactly lacking either. When you add the direction of Stanley Donen and the screenplay of Peter Stone, you have a winner. Doesn't hurt that your support cast includes such stars as: Walter Matthau, James Coburn, and George Kennedy. This film plays like a love letter to earlier Grant-Hitchcock work like North by Northwest, Notorious, and To Catch a Thief. Grant only made 2 more films after this, and retired from acting in 1966; it's a testament to what an actor he was that he was still on top of his game here, and didn't look out of place in the action sequences (one always worries that they'll end up looking like Roger Moore's Bond in the early 80s when a star doesn't quite convince they can be physical anymore). The pairing with Hepburn really works well, she seems to bring out a very natural performance in Grant. The story has twists and turns and keeps you guessing, and even if you do figure a few things out, it won't spoil the film for you at all. A bona-fide classic, and one you can enjoy again and again.

Twists and turns keep us on our toes and it stands tall with the best of modern thrillers. Very worth the watch as it lends class, thrills, laughs, and chills from minute to minute.",

            "content": "\"I'm having a nervous breakdown. \"\n\nAfter many recommendations from the RT community, I finally got to watch Charade, a famous suspense thriller starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. It's been called \"the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made\". And with that statement, I think they may be right.\n\nWealthy Reggie Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is about to divorce her husband, but soon finds out that he's been murdered. She is summoned by CIA official Bartholomew (Walter Matthau) that the husband was a crook who was involved in the theft of $250,000and has been hidden since the war. Reggie teams up with the mysterious Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) and go all out to find the missing money before the other crooks, Tex (James Coburn), Gideon (Ned Glass), and Scobie (George Kennedy), find the money first and kill her off as well.\n\nAlthough Charade was not directed by Alfred Hitchcock, there's quite a few things that makes it feel like a Hitchcock movie. It's got an unlikely couple, many twists and turns along the way, a chilling score (in this case, Henry Mancini), Cary Grant, a very attractive leading lady, and loads of memorable comedic sequences along the way. The funny thing about Charade is that it was directed by Stanley Donen, who's best known for directing the acclaimed musical Singin' in the Rain. It sounds like an odd choice for the directing job, but Donen's direction actually works.\n\nFrom the unforgettable opening sequence where the dead husband is thrown out of a train, there's no turning back. Charade is one crazy thrill after another, and it's just fantastic. Generally, when someone tries to imitate Hitchcock, they overdo it (look at The Postman Always Rings Twice if you want proof). In Charade, Donen didn't overdo it at all. It had about the usual number of twists in a Hitchcock film and it was very suspenseful to watch, especially the last 30 minutes.\n\nThe casting is, in one simple word, perfect. Audrey Hepburn was incredible as Reggie Lampert. Hepburn delights in her fears on being killed and also makes a good spy. Cary Grant delights as well. If you've seen Hitchcock's North by Northwest, then you know how complex Grant can be in these kinds of films, and Grant's role here is even crazier. Without giving much away, let's just say that either he's a good guy or a bad guy. Putting Hepburn and Grant together is like putting two peas in a pod. Their chemistry was excellent and they were also very funny, especially Grant. I really enjoyed a scene where grant takes a shower with his clothes on to lower Hepburn's sexual attraction for him. It was quite funny. \n\nWalter Matthau is memorable as the CIA official, and the three villains, James Coburn, Ned Glass, and George Kennedy, are also great in their roles as well, especially Coburn, who plays a villainous cowboy.\n\nThere's also a score by the great Henry Mancini (who's best known for his jazzy Pink Panther score), and it's very chilling. The opening theme, during a super crazy Maurice Binder title sequence, is just stellar. The haunting sounds of Mancini's score stands out and you'd think that the score was done by Bernard Herrman. While I enjoy the Pink Panther score more, Charade comes close. And I mean super close. \n\nCharade is a exciting Hitchcock thriller made by Singin' in the Rain director Stanley Donen. It's very thrilling, it has a chilling and awesome Henry Mancini score, wonderful performances from Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, plenty of twists and turns, and a crazy title sequence from the same man who gave us those crazy James Bond title sequences. I highly recommend Charade, and if I loved it, then whoever loves watching Hitchcock will love it as well without feeling like it's a rip-off.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know who anyone is!\"",
