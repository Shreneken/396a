    "summary": "Imprisoned during World War II in a German POW camp, a group of Allied soldiers are intent on breaking out, not only to escape, but also to draw Nazi forces away from battle to search for fugitives. Among the prisoners determined to escape are American Captain Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) and British Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough). Outwitting their captors by digging a tunnel out of the prison grounds, the soldiers find the stakes much higher when escape becomes a reality.",

Bernstein's iconic score is memorable and Fapp's photography gloriously captures the Alpine scenery in the final act, which is also memorable for McQueen's attempts to cross the border by motorbike.",

Seriously? About as real as Fonzie jumping the shark, and as \"cool\"). The ending, if one invests any emotions or feelings into the characters, is pretty depressing (What's with the title of this thing?). Also inconsistencies abound - how can someone who digs tons of tunnels suddenly have always been claustrophobic? This movie is a cartoon, and an insult to the real prisoners that this is *actually* based on.",

The problems with the movie seem obvious and include the fact that it is simply too long.  There are a number of scenes (the moonshine segment, for example) that could have been cut without hurting the impact of the movie.  As well, the catchy theme song gets tiresome after a while and, despite being based on a true story, some of the elements and logistics of the tunnel excavation seem implausible.  Regardless, it's a pretty captivating tale filled with inspiration, tragedy, a smattering of humor, more than its fair shar of thrills, and a cast of likable characters.",

It's superbly acted and has humor that still works today. It's quite soft, but I guess movies back then rearely played on the shock factor. Lot of stuff happen here and some action is still pretty tight.

Other Americans appear in this wholly British tale: the always reliable James Garner,  Charles Bronson – and one with a questionable accent (I'm looking at you, James Coburn). \n\nWhile the first part goes on too long - though it does provide some much-needed levity - it is the last hour of the film that is a masterfully sustained piece of action and tension as the various escapees struggle for freedom via train, bicycle, motorbike, row boat and even hitchhiking. Director John Sturges inter-cuts between their respective attempts and leads us to the inevitable tragedy of this based-on-real-life chapter of British WWII history.\n\nI liked it well enough.

It's surprisingly funny as every man is working to escape for the entirety of the film. It's an escalating caper of rising tension and brutal suspense with constant casual humor for levity despite the dark subject matter. \n\nSturges lets you feel like a POW stuck in a German camp going mad, while he also emphasizes the bravery and teamwork of the inmates. Sturges keeps you engaged and laughing for all 173 minutes until the poignant finale. Ferris Webster's editing is very light and allows you to enjoy each scene without many cuts.\n\nW.R. Burnett, James Clavell, and Paul Brickhill's script is very engaging as they meticulously describe what daily life is like in POW camps and how these soldiers attempt numerous escape plans. You understand how monotonous imprisonment is and how inventive these men were to outsmart the wretched Nazis holding them throughout WWII. Daniel L. Fapp's cinematography has some very creative wide shots of the camp and all his close-ups of the escape tunnels are very neat. \n\nElmer Bernstein's legendary score is instantly recognizable with that iconic whistling melody. He has a lot of variety throughout The Great Escape with all kinds of more subtle songs for sneaking around or giving chase depending on the action he is accompanying.\n\nSteve McQueen, James Coburn, and Sir Richard Attenborough are excellent, hilarious, and cool as these heroes. But it is Charles Bronson's sensitive character that steals the show. Bronson displays his war hero as vulnerable with a fear of the dark and claustrophobia. His frightened whimpers during the blackout in the tunnel and the tunnel collapse while digging are the most tense sequences in The Great Escape. \n\nIt's a brilliant film with a great cast.",

Really good acting with all the cast from Steve McQueen to Donald Pleasence. Really good characters that even have nicknames. Very good cinematography with some iconic shots. Really good setting with the prisoner of war camp. Really good set design and props. Really good costume design with the Nazis to the Prisoners. Very good style from the colour design to the way its filmed. Very good practical effects. Very good and iconic action though theres not much. Good and steady sound design. Very good and quotable dialogue. Good and steady editing. Really good music one of the best soundtracks in my personal opinion. Great story that is pulled off extremely well by the cast, crew and director. Very good comedy more toward thebeginning. The film also has very good atmosphere especially at the end of the second act. The film can also be very emotional and could even make you cry a little. The film is also quiet tense mainly toward the end of the second act to the end of third and final act. Though the film is nearly three hours long it is still really enjoyable. The film also has one of my personal favourite endings of all time. Over all I give the great escape a 9/10 - so close",

Almost disney-esque at times, although it is undoubtedly entertaining, it is completely silly. Attenborough saves the day by trying to introduce some gravitas but it is hard to keep the silliness at bay. The POW camp seems so lovely and friendly you have to ask why anyone would want to escape from there! The Nazis are like silent cardboard cutouts and Steve McQueen's smirk wears thin after a while. This was a great film to enjoy many years ago but it's lighthearted touch doesn't really work in 2018.",

            "content": "clearly ahead of its time..\n\nThe Great Escape\n\nSturges's nail biting escape from the war, is a symphony that soars among all the best outcome that the genre has given us. Sturges means business in here, from the first frame till the curtain drops. He doesn't have any time to go waste by, he cares for the quality offered to the viewers. And the standard is kept persistent. The story called for your usual supporting characters with allotted characteristics that keeps the viewers tangled onto them. But this is no fiction, each characters might be given a signature name, but they are more to what they seem and Sturges proves that in nearly three hours that feels like seconds passing by.\n\nThe primary strength of the feature is how the makers fiddle with the geography, environment and the set pieces that every now and then elevates the momentum as the gripping screenplay enfolds onto the screen. The narration is gripping and adoptive with a fascinating structure that builds up the base with equal sincerity and mannerism. It relies a lot upon the physical sequences and yet it never grows dull for it is brimmed with tiny notions and tactics that are pure delights. McQueen stands out from the first act and still he remains of the similar palpable tone like the rest of his cast.\n\nGarner gets a much stronger parallel role but Bronson's few compelling sequences steals the show. The cunning ways to cheat their way out and the surveillance team still figuring out their tricks, these sew saw are the best bits of the feature and they are in plethora of it; it is thoroughly entertaining. Armed with such a sharp adaptation, Sturges's execution is plausible and is worth every drop of the sweat that went into it. The Great Escape confronts the reality with a language that was clearly ahead of its time.",

But this is not the case with The Great Escape because it is just as good now as it was probably back then. The action scenes in this movie are just as good if not better than many action scenes that are made now. Many of the characters are likeable and it is just unbelievable that it is based on a true story. Throughout the movie it was excited, action packed, and it was a Steve McQueen movie.. what do you expect.\n\nSince this movie is based on a true story it seems that you would think it would be boring. But this is one of those stories that this is not the case. I do not know much about the true story but what I do know is that the entire movie is based on facts. All of it, the escape plan, the amount of people that escaped, how long the tunnel was and the fact that there were 3 tunnels. All down to the detail that it was based the book from the detail which allows the movie to have a sense of realism.\n\nI liked that movie did not have many down times but when they were down they were down. I liked the characters of the movie and liked watching the escapes. I thought that the way that the tunnel scene was filmed was really good and other movies should take note of the way it was filmed. The acting in the movie was very believable and allows the audience to feel with the people and want them to escape rather than to make them the bad guys and want them to get caught.\n\nOverall I thought the movie did what it wanted to be set out to be. The acting, directing, editing, and script was really well done. It had little boring parts of the movie and it really could not have any scenes that they could have cut out. The film had a really good treatment of history and I think that could not have been better. I really don't have any complaints other that the movie left me wanting more, which is a good thing.",

You somehow know it's going to be alright when he's on screen. Always ahead of his time with his colloquial demeanor, McQueen helps bridge the gap between old and new Hollywood, making the classics more accessible to younger audiences. \n\nBut The Great Escape is entertaining even when McQueen isn't present. The 1963 classic mixes suspense and levity brilliantly as it follows a group of allied prisoners in a German camp attempting their biggest escape yet during World War II.\n\nThe Great Escape is plot buildup at its finest. Writer-director, John Sturges, has an impeccable sense of narrative. From start to finish its tone never wavers. And even with its juggernaut of a runtime clocking in at nearly 3 hours, you're never checking your watch. \n\nAlthough in this day and age it helps to know the history--seeing as World War II was still fairly fresh in everyone's minds back in 1963. But setting aside, you can still appreciate the general storyline. Even a younger audience should be able to follow along easily and still enjoy this movie's timely humor. \n\nElmer Bernstein's score helps to drive this film with strong motifs. It echoes The Bridge on the River Kwai, but has a feel all of its own.\n\nThe Great Escape is a phenomenal film. It's consistent and thoroughly engaging, and the type of movie that just puts a smile on your face. With a little help from McQueen, it holds up very well. He's at his best here, like always. And the rest of the cast is so strong that this film is great even when he's absent--he's just the cherry on top.\n\nTwizard Rating: 100",

The entire film feels like a high quality heist movie.  The team is assembled, we get to find out who is going to do what, and then we slowly see the plan executed.  I have so much fun with this style of film, and it is made even better when you care about the people involved.  The Great Escape went above and beyond the call of duty when it came to those people because within less than 30 minutes of film I felt like I knew and connected with at least twelve different characters (amazing considering most films nowadays struggle to even get you to care about ONE.) I was a little disappointed with the somewhat mundane nature of the actual plan because, aside from the size of the escape, it was the same as many other escapes they had attempted in the past.  I guess modern Hollywood has conditioned me to expect something more intricate and complex with multiple moving parts.  But I have to give additional respect to the film despite this plan, because they were telling a true story which can make even the mundane more exciting.  I quite enjoyed the entire film, but I did have one big problem which might be a more personal expectation issue but it kept me from completely falling in love with the movie.\n\nBig-time spoilers:  The title set me up with false hope that this was going to be a big awesome happy ending.  To be clear, I know this is based on a true story, so I'm not expecting they should change history.  I just kept getting hit by disappointment and sadness that I never expected when the film began.  First I have the big-time letdown when less than half of the planned number of prisoners actually make it out of the compound.  So that was part one of my sadness.  Then the even bigger letdown that almost every single escapee is caught and most of them are slaughtered.  It was just such a downer ending to what felt like such an uplifting film.  I almost expected that the movie was about to continue with an even bigger escape that was actually successful, sadly it was not meant to be.  I want to make a point of saying I understand, in a way, they were completely successful because they stymied the German forces and made them devote way too many resources to recovering those who escaped.  But it doesn't FEEL like a win when so many characters that you grew to love get unceremoniously executed.",

Imagine a movie where you would put all the greatest movie stars of their Era in. That's exactly what they did here! The Great Escape is, in my mind, the greatest War movie of all Time. Add to the stellar cast, a score by Legendary Hollywood composer Elmer Bernstein and there you have one of the greatest War movie themes of all Time. A theme with a tune so catchy, so memorable that you might find yourself humming and whistling it as you go through your day. The Great Escape is basically the story of POW during War time in their Nazi detention camp. And what are, not just POW but the best POW, up to in their enemy detention camp? They plan their escape. An escape so ingenious that it involves digging three tunnels at the same time underneath and through their camp to the wood outside. In the main role we have Hollywood Legend, Steve Mc Queen as Lieutenant Virgil Hilts, a hot shot American pilot who has only one idea in his head, Escaping! One of the most interesting scene for me was at the end, when Hilts, recaptured again, is about to be put back in his cell inside the cooler. There you have a German guard ready to put our hero, who incidentally is the personification of the perfect Aryan, blue eyed and blond hairs, into his cell. As the guard closes the door and walks away from Hilts' cell, he hears the noise of Hilts' baseball bouncing off the walls, back and forth into Hilts' baseball glove. He pauses for instant as if to ponder whether what he is doing to the embodiment of the perfect German specimen is wrong. He lowers his head, then walks away with his head held down as if to convey that he realizes that what he is doing is wrong and he could never break Hilts' strong spirit. I highly recommend this all time Classic for all, a masterpiece!",

This is a truly fun and exciting movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat as they execute their elaborate plan to escape this prison camp by digging a tunnel that leads to freedom.

The pace is surprisingly good for a movie that isn't a too packed and takes the first two hours to lead up to the escape, it's all very interesting and holds your attention with ease.  How close it stays to historically what happened I'm not sure, I've read the book and some other books on the subject and although many details stray far, they do have an audience to amuse.  It's believable anyway, but from the book to the movie I did have some character confusions.  The whole camp looked good, everything was really well done, and as a young person when I first saw this I of course sang the theme song, the song they played when celebrating the revolution, and spend plenty of time doing the ball bounce of the wall thing that Steve did in the cooler.  The ending isn't a happily ever after either, it's how it went and disentangle make it feel like some sort of cheesy propaganda film, which it isn't.  Doesn't show the long winter march or the camp liberation, but shows what it said it would and does a very good job.  Better than the newer POW movie Harts War for sure.  Very well done, and one of my favourite of the my favourite not action based WWII movie.",

I decided to lower my expectations going into this film due to the amount of praise I heard and did not want to disappoint myself. To my surprise, I found myself a solid war film that was enjoyable from start to finish.\nThe story is simple yet effective. Everyone knows that the film consists of a group of men burying their way out of a German camp. Seeing them play it out and struggle with their personal issues is what really give the film its goodness. The locations is well picked and fits in with the era set. There is really nothing else that I can mention about the score. The music is perfectly put together and plays over the acceptable sequences. \nThe interesting thing I got out of this was Steve McQueen's performance. Most praise for the Great Escape often came with praise for McQueen. I personally just could not see what was so great about the star. He was not bad or had anything to flaw him with, but I just could not see nothing memorable in his performance. On the other hand, I was very impressed with Richard Attenborough and really was brought into his character, along with Donald Pleasence and Charles Bronson.\nI did have some issue with how the Germans were presented. I have had it explained and I am aware that some Germans were quite nice fellas within the camps, but I felt this could have been changed slightly for the tension to work. It works in the second half when the Germans become more demanding and fierce, but in the first half they are interacting in quite a polite manner with the prisoners. I was starting to wonder to myself why they would want to leave, and when they tried to build the tension up I just couldn't get involved in any visible threat.\nThe only other niggle I would say is the lack of subtitles. There are a few foreign conversations which leaves their wording to the imagination. Other than this, I can't fault The Great Escape. Apart from some very nice Germans, I can easily see why so many hold the Great Escape highly.",

Thankfully it ended on a high note, maintaining my affection towards this film. The Elmer Bernstein's memorable score inserted a sense of energy and lightness to its atmosphere and at the same time avoiding the film from coming off as comedically light; and definitely head over heels than his already unforgettable score in Sturges' previous film The Magnificent Seven.

Corral (1957), The Magnificent Seven (1960), Ice Station Zebra (1968) and McQ (1974)), and based upon the 1950 book by Paul Brickhill. This prisoner of war film has become renowned as one of the best of it's kind, and it's aided by a very good ensemble cast from both sides of the Atlantic all giving very great performances, and it's well made too. In 1944, the Nazi's have just opened Stalag Luft III in Sagan, which is used to prevent any prisoners from escaping. Luftwaffe Colonel von Luger (Hannes Messemer) is Commandant of the camp, and he's going to ensure that no-one escapes from the camp while he's in charge. However, he didn't count on RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), using 3 tunnels to break most of the prisoners out, and they include Captain Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen), Lt. Robert Hendley (James Garner), Captain Ramsey (James Donald), Lt. Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence), Danny Valinski (Charles Bronson) and Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn). It has some very good moments throughout, and it's easy to forget how suspenseful this film is, and how cunning the allied forces were against the Nazi's. The film might be a touch on the overlong side, (it could have done with 40 mins shaved off), but other than that, it has some very good and memorable moments.",

With that much time you'd think you'd get to know a little bit more about the characters - i.e. individual perspectives and experiences. I also don't understand what was so \"GREAT\" about this escape. Yes, 76 brave men made it out of the Stalag - but nearly all of those men were recaptured and 50 sadly executed. To me, that is more appropriately titled \"The Escape Attempt That Ended in Tragedy\". Also, why was McQueen's character the only one sent to the cooler in the end? Was that just Hollywood's way of ending on a semi comical high note? That being said, I won't blaspheme any further on the subject of this beloved film.

            "content": "Based on a true story, The Great Escape is about a group of Allied soldiers who are sent to a Nazi prison camp during WWII, a camp so extreme that it's extremely difficult to escape from it. Immediately, British soldier \"Big X\" (Richard Attenborough) masterminds a plan to escape from prison, and intends to bring every prisoner with him.\n\nJoining this wonderful escape plan includes James Garner as \"The Scrounger\", James Coburn as \"The Manufacturer\", Donald Pleasance as \"The Forger\", Charles Bronsan as \"The Tunnel King\",  John Leyton as \"The Other Tunnel King\", and of coarse, Steve McQueen as \"The Cooler King\".\n\nDirector John Sturges is known for making big, elaborate action films, such as The Magnificent Seven, and The Great Escape is no exception. In three hours, we are treated to a wonderful, exciting, and epic adventure film, with a smart cast.\n\nEvery single actor in this film is excellent, with the two biggest standouts being Steve McQueen and James Garner. The ironic thing about these two is that although they were friends in real life, on set, McQueen thought that Garner was trying to steal the film away from him, which almost got him fired. In the end, both stars got a huge career out of this film.\n\nOther memorable cast members include Charles Bronsan, James Coburn, Donald Pleasance, and Richard Attenborough. As I said before, every actor in the film is excellent and they bring their game in a film meant for excitement.\n\nThe story, which is based on a true story, is also excellent. You root for their characters and want them to break out of prison to get back home. For kids born after WWII, this was their introduction to the harsh and evil Nazis and caused a huge impact on these kids. \n\nThe score, by the legendary Elmer Bernstein, is epic. The theme march song is catchy, and the rest sums up the excitement of the film, especially in the climax.\n\nAnd speaking of the climax, the climax, which involves Steve McQueen in a motorcycle, is just awesome. If you know Steve McQueen, you know you're in for it when it's him doing the stunts, well, except for that jump, which was done by the stunt double. Through the magic power of editing, the German officer who was chasing him was also Steve McQueen. In one of the greatest chase scenes of all-time, here we have Steve McQueen being chased by Steve McQueen. That's awesome.\n\nSimply put, The Great Escape is an excellent film for everyone. There's lots of action, there's a big name cast, and an excellent motorcycle chase from Steve McQueen. You will enjoy three hours of pure excitement.",

But thereâs one war movie I really like, and that movie is John Sturgesâ 1963 WWII film THE GREAT ESCAPE. Based on the book by former real life POW officer Paul Brickhill, The Great Escape tells the story of a group of allied escape artist type prisoner of war (POWs) officers (and what a great cast too): Capt. Virgil Hilts âThe Cooler Kingâ (Steve McQueen), Flight Lt. Bob Hendley âThe Scroungerâ (James Garner), Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett âBig Xâ (Richard Attenborough), Flight Lt. Danny Velsinski âThe Tunnel Kingâ (Charles Bronson), Flight Lt. Colin Blythe âThe Forgerâ (Donald Pleasence), and Flying Officer Louis Sedgwick âThe Manufacturerâ (James Coburn) who put together a daring escape from Stalag Luft III, a German prisoner of war camp during World War II. Iâve been watching this movie since I was twelve years old, It is one the greatest movies I have ever seen, and itâs one of my all time favorites. The music that legendary composer Elmer Bernstein made for this film is fantastic. I love how the movie starts when you see the trucks driving to the camp and how it ends when you see who played who in the film. I would have to imagine the German guard, who locks up Hilts in The Cooler, smiling when he hears the familiar sound of Hilts bouncing his baseball on the wall. I think he likes that. Thereâs one character from the Gestapo and SS agents who bring Big X to the camp I didnât like, and that is Preissen (played by German actor Ulrich Beiger). The way he closes his briefcase makes me want to see him killed. Anyway, my favorite scene out of the whole movie is of course is seeing Steve McQueen being pursued by German Soldiers in the famous motorcycle chase. THE GREAT ESCAPE is an unforgettable classic that all movie lovers should see and love.",

Aquí aunque es evidente el protagonismo de Steve McQueen cuyo rol es de los más recordados en el filme, igualmente todo el elenco era estelar con nombres como Charles Bronson, James Garner, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough, David McCallum e inclusive Donald Pleasence que su participación fué muy útil ya que él fué prisionero de un verdadero campo de concentración Nazi cuando sirvió en el Ejército Británico durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Dato curioso es que el actor que interpreta al Comandante del campo fué prisionero de un campo ruso igualmente en la WWII.

            "content": "The mother of all POW movies.\n\nThe Great Escape is, all in all, a fantastic movie but I have to point out a few things that bothered me a bit and dragged the whole production a bit down.\nFirst of all, almost three hours is way to long for such a movie. Thanks for the effort and the slow build-up, but come on! Nobody wants to see a straight action movie for three hours, even if it's as good as this one.\nFurthermore, how can you possibly screw up the setting part if you're actually shooting on location!!! I googled where it was filmed, and they did indeed produced it in Bavaria, but Bavaria looks more like a huge film set to me - I'm curious what went wrong with these guys.\nAlso, the comedic tone, especially in the beginning, doesn't fit into the topic matter at all. I guess it's the way war films were made back then (I witnessed similar in The Dirty Dozen), but all the fun and joking feels a bit odd if you make such an ending (which is not really a classic Hollywood happy end).\nToday you would definitely do a more sincere and darker film on this subject, but maybe it's this exact approach that lifts the old beloved classics over todays blockbuster fare. I don't know but let's focus on the good things.\n\nOne good thing is Steve McQueen on a motorcycle, another one is Steve McQueen grinning mischieviously after a failed escape, another one is Richard Attenborough (I've seen him in Brighton Rock and in Miracle on 34th Street - this role is somewhere in the middle) and yet another one the duo of James Garner and Donald Pleasence. Long story short, an awesome cast you got here.\n\nEspecially the latter half is also pretty exciting. The escape itself and the aftermath of the different groups trying to get to the border are tense and creative, and directed pretty carefully, although I might suggest that a lower number of main characters would have been helpful to remember all the ongoings.\nI also liked the ending, darker and grimmer than I expected (although, as I said, this clashed a bit with the general tone of the film). Still, I'm a bit curious why The Great Escape has such a prominent place in the Imdb amongst others, but beside that, a highly entertaining flick.",

            "content": "With a massive ensemble cast and a notorious legacy of references in popular culture, The Great Escape sounded like an utter war classic.\n\nThe Great Escape is a brilliant story. Based on the account of writer Paul Brickhill, it is a historical moment war history where prisoners took a notorious stand against German oppressors. The titular escape is one which required very extensive planning with intricate dedication to achieve, and John Sturges makes an effort to cover this in every detail. Of course there is no way to capture every last detail within a mere 165 minutes, but John Sturges uses the same dedication to detail that his characters do and ensures that his film is written with precision. The story makes a strong effort to capture every little contribution put towards structuring the escape without dragging itself on in the process. The pace is sensible enough to not rush itself, but it doesn't succumb to boredom either because there is always something happening. \nRunning at nearly three hours, it would be very easy for The Great Escape to end up dragging on. Structured in a similar manner as The Dirty Dozen (1967), The Great Escape spends its first two hours building up to its titular climax and the remaining 45 minutes unleashing it. There are surely times when things take a significant drop in pace, but the film is kept alive by the fact that the atmosphere is rich and the characters are entertaining. \nThe focus of The Great Escape is very much on the larger scale of events, and since there are so many characters and important stars to the film, it is a challenge to evenly focus on everyone. Most of the film is focused on escape itself, reducing the majority of the characters to a collection of different soldiers whose individuality largely comes from the star power of the actors portraying them. However, this does not neglect the human tragedy of the story. Although it is rather sporadic amid the spectacle, there are some powerful moments that remind us of the individuals who put together the escape and the challenges they faced. Even though The Great Escape has to take certain liberties with facts and characters so that the film can offer more drama and star power, there is no denying that what The Great Escape captures is nothing short of brilliant. It is a powerful tale of men working as a team for each other, for themselves and for country which reminds us of the extensive challenges faced in the war outside of combat. The Great Escape is very well scripted and directed with tenacity, leaving it rich in atmosphere as well as style.\nThanks to the work of Elmer Bernstein's musical score, the mood is always reinforced. His work is a masterpiece with a true classical feeling to it. Elmer Bernstein opens the film with the rather lighthearted theme song to the film, an iconic piece of music which has a mix between gleeful energy and a military march. This is immediately followed by a more dark and intense theme intended to capture the feeling of prison confinement. From there, the music manages to always assists the mood of the story in developing along with its plot dynamics. Since the music establishes the mood of the film, there is always an eerie feeling when things are silent. During these moments, the sound effects are left to supplement the music and do an effective job of keeping things intense.\nThe visual experience of The Great Escape is absolutely brilliant. Cleverly making use of its relatively small budget, John Sturges proves once again that he has a keen eye for spectacle imagery. The Great Escape spends the majority of its film in a singular location with a strong reconstruction of the Stalag Luft III, capturing a confined feeling by shooting mostly inside the compound. It gets particularly notable during the scenes depicting the tunnel digging as there are intricate angles used to capture a sense of claustrophobia. When the film reaches its escape, the scale becomes much larger and the cinematography captures some brilliant backdrops. The on-location scenery is remarkable and rich with colour, decorated with production designs and costumes which easily capture the timeframe of WWII. And since the film covers a lot of ground, there is a large scope of versatile scenery to enjoy.\nThe action is also impressive. Since The Great Escape is not a war film about the battle, it does not offer a conventional style of action. There are some action moments in the climax, but they are not shootouts and explosions. They are depictions of the characters attempting to successfully make an escape, and the more exhilarating examples of this include James Garner and Donald Pleasence on an aviation journey and Steve McQueen's iconic motorcycle chase sequence. The select amount of action in The Great Escape is reserved for the climax and proves a satisfactory conclusion for the feature even though it is not on the scale of a typical war film.\nAnd since the many characters in The Great Escape are portrayed by a large number of stars, the limitations on character exploration are elevated by the status of the actors.\nSteve McQueen is a perfectly solid lead. With proud masculine charisma, Steve McQueen actively has fun in the role while taking it very seriously. Playing at Virgil Hilts' desire to taunt the enemy with his escape talents, Steve McQueen uses a lighthearted and likable spirit for most of the film while pulling it back for a focus on silent tension during the more richly atmospheric moments of the film. His interactions with the cast just rolls along with energetic development of the narrative while his dedication to performing his own stunts yields exceptional motorcycle stunts. Steve McQueen is a brilliant lead for The Great Escape.\nJames Garner is also a great addition to the cast. James Garner has a very strong edge of sophistication to him. With the spirit of a leader he manages to capture the essence of a soldier while his interactions with the surrounding cast members can range from intense to gentle, oscillating between different types of drama with organic flow. His work is brilliant, and his chemistry with Donald Pleasence is particularly deserving of praise for the soft spirit of genuine care for he displays for his brother in war, effectively balancing dramatic material on all different scales without hesitation whenever the story calls for it.\nRichard Attenborough delivers one of his best acting performances in The Great Escape. Deep in the roots of his character and never stepping out, Richard Attenborough is always on guard for whatever happens. As the leader of the escape, Richard Attenborough works to develop his tension along with the film itself while keeping audiences informed of events with an intelligent and tenacious grip over the dialogue and a skill for delivering it with dramatic spirit. Richard Attenborough truly delivers a rich performance in The Great Escape and carries an impressive sense of leadership which reflects his real-life skill as a respectable film director.\nCharles Bronson is given one of the most human characters in the story. Despite his hard edge and his legacy for portraying tough guys, Charles Bronson diverts his stereotypical status into a character who carries his iconic strengths yet is not bereft of humane vulnerability. Charles Bronson carries a likable attitude to him which brings in some comedic moments but he also grasps a lot of the best low-key dramatic sequences in the film enhanced by his chemistry with John Leyton, meaning that The Great Escape offers one of Charles Bronson's greatest performances from his heyday, even in the face of such a talented ensemble.\nIn a similar veign, James Coburn carries an intrinsic tough guy status about him but doesn't pursue a mundane path. Due to his hearty tone of voice and tall stature, James Coburn which reflects a young John Huston. He blends in with the crowd easily due to a sensibly restrained performance.\nGordon Jackson has a Charlton Heston -type look about him and the same charming smile that comes with it, although his hard edge is not as gritty and therefore he has greater depth to him. Donald Pleasence has a classy charm to him as well as a feeling of vulnerability, with the latter also being captured by Angus Lennie and John Leyton. Nigel Stock also carries a handsome charm.\n\nSo The Great Escape is an extensive war classic which never loses tension for a second due to its consistently moving narrative and brilliant script coupled with a brilliant cast, an unforgettable musical score and John Sturges' keen eye for magnificent imagery.",

Surtout quand le classique s'avère être un film de presque 3h qui passe en 1h15. On parle ici de la plus grande tentative d'évasion jamais tentée par des hommes qui se sont enrôlés dans l'armée avant de finalement tenter de déserter, puis d'être mis dans une prison spéciale avec d'autres soldats qui ont tentés de déserter.\n\nUne centaine de soldats qui surveille deux centaines de soldats qui ont déjà tentés de déserter l'armée. Ironique, non? Le film est d'ailleurs incroyablement thrillant, et non ne cesse de s'attacher aux 250 personnages principaux (héhé), bien que le jeu de la majorité des acteurs manquent de réalisme.\n\nFranchement, c'est presque impossible de ne pas aimer The Great Escape.",

The pace and the tension during the planning and execution of the escape build so masterfully that you're constantly on the edge of your seat wondering if they're going to get caught. However, the last third of the film is where all the problems show up. It feels like everyone has all their wits about them while planning the escape, and then once everyone is running around Germany, everyone's intelligence seems to plummet. Everyone seems to do exactly the worst thing possible. It's supposedly based on a true story, but you're left wondering, how stupid were all these escapees? Actingwise, the film's best performance belongs to Donald Pleasence, who definitely has the clearest arc out of all the characters. Still, it's a fun movie, and even though it pushes three hours in length, it's never boring and always keeps your attention.",

            "content": "And so, for the Magnificent McQueen's next magic trick, he presents, \"The Great Escape\"! This title does actually sound a bit like a magic trick, yet don't make that mistake, because magic is kind of dorky, and the legendary Steve McQueen was anything but. Man, he was so manly that he played a sailor, and as we know, there's nothing lame about being a sailor, let alone gay. Okay, in all seriousness, even in \"The Sand Pebbles\", he was so awesomely charismatic and cool that the Oscars just had to give him an Oscar nomination for his simply being so awesome... and because he cried a little bit in the role. Wow, come to think of it, by leading role, are we really sure that he was offered the George Peppard role in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\"? No, but seriously though, the boy was just too cool for school, as well as German prison camps, so if anyone was going to keep a film like this from slowing down then, well, Steve McQueen should have done it, so I guess this film is beyond saving from slowness. No, the film does have quite a lot of kick to it, yet it doesn't quite have enough juice in it to escape slowness.\r\n\r\nRunning a whopping 172 minutes and not being a Bollywood action film, this film is much too long to be consistent in its intrigue, and sure enough, the film dries up something awful and awful fast, not necessarily being meditative in its story structure, just kind of dull, with story and character exposition going further hurt by the constant action of the story, only with significantly less intrigue for the over eventfulness to feel all that eventful. Overly take-action, yet consistently over steady and, at times, bone-dry, this sprawler gets to be a crawler after a while, losing steam much too often. To make matters worse, even with the concept boasting potential at sweep, it doesn't quite wield nearly three hours worth of material, so it should almost go without saying that some excess fat around the scenes, with repetition serving a more prominent and damaging threat to the film's tightness, a flaw found in a number of epic-length non-epics of this type and era. Hey, I'll at least give it to the film for its commitment to go out there and extract detrimental flaws from films of this formula in order to further augment this film's pile of conventions. No, the film isn't quite that bad generic, yet the fact of the matter is that this film is simply too 1960s, falling a tad too deeply into many of the conventional flaws and substance tropes of the time, and with many of those common tones being hardly threatening, even with our facing a large story of should-be high danger and intrigue, the film feels rather underwhelming in the way of tension for many long lapses within in this almost three hour storyline, further adding to the periodic steam loss. Really, there's surprisingly not a whole lot to say about the film, other than the fact that it's slow and repetitive, with not enough intrigue or audacity to warrant such a lengthy runtime. Well, you can say that about the film, as well as the fact that it has enough to it to counteract the flaws and leave it a worthwhile picture that may not be capable of escaping its own plagues, yet goes the distance enough to win you over.\r\n\r\nLimited in the depth you would expect, or at least hope to see in a film of this subject matter, the story is not terribly strong, with faulty execution further securing that statement, yet it reamins intriguing for what it is. The film over prominently reptitiously, yet intriguingly studies upon the layers and depths of the core plot, creating a sesne of investment that most certainly would have been intensified were there also more meditation exposition and the tone of danger, yet still stands fairly strong. It certainly goes amplified by the occasional moment of genuine depth, something that's found not nearly as much as it should be, yet delivers quite a fair bit when it does come into play at typically just the right moment, giving the story more weight, consequence and compellingness, and, again, while more depth would have proved most favorable for the final product, as things stand, these spurts of depth that break up general intrigue, spawned from the film's core being handled mostly quite well, is enough to get the film by as just compelling enough to be deemed generally rewarding. For that, nevermind the writers and director, it's the performers who you really have to thank, as they deliver distinctiveness in their never-the-same, yet always involving presences, both as individuals, and as a whole. Mostly, everyone's a charisma, especially an obviously show-owning Steve McQueen, yet there does get to be a certain level of depth in most everyone, and it's depth that doesn't give the film terribly powerful resonance, yet certainly builds upon the already present level of depth and intrigue that would ultimately be a shadow of what it ultimately is if it didn't have such talents backing it up. Still, our performers are at their most static when they join each other on the screen, as the chemistry between just about every person is palpable, whether we're feeling the razor-sharp sense of building comradery among our leads or the sense of distrust between our protagonists and antagonists. It's that level of humanity, depth and chemistry that helps significantly in defining a film like this, especially when the film is so heavily flawed, and these performers do what they do and do it all more than well enough to extract from the film charm, depth and a feel for that defining humanity, giving this film the strength needed to stand as a generally satisfying, if nothing else, character study.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the run, the film finds itself often dulled down quite a bit by dryness and excessive padding, made all the worse by only so much in the way of exposition, leaving the film overlong and potentiall fall-flat, yet through a generally winning plot filled with intriguing concepts, as well as a fair couple of moments of genuine depth and, most of all, consistently charming, distinctive and, at times, soulful performances by a slew of electric charisma - whom define their characters and, by extension, the film itself through such strong performances, matched, if not beaten out by their level of fiery, winning chemistry -, \"The Great Escape\" makes it through as a generally compelling and rather rewarding not-all-that-thrilling thriller.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

McQueen plays the renegade loner hero perfectly, but that's not necessarily saying he acted great. It just comes so naturally to him. I liked Donald Pleasance, and Bronson looks great, but I wasn't impacted significantly by anyone of them...Oh but the guy falling through the beds was excellent, I laughed out loud at that.
