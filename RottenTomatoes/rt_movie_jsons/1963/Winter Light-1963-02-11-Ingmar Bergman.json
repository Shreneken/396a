            "content": "Tomas (Gunnar Bjornstrand), the pastor of a Catholic church in a small Swedish community, is having a crisis of faith, unable to come to terms with the existence of God in the world in which he lives.  After failing to provide comfort to Jonas (Max von Sydow), a depressed parishioner worried about the threat of an atomic war, he turns his back on the only person who cares for him, Marta (Ingrid Thulin), a lonely schoolteacher.  Winter Light is as somber and stark a film as Ingmar Bergman has ever created\u2026and that's saying something.  Beautifully shot by Bergman regular Sven Nykvist, Winter Light is filled with haunting images and insightful dialogue that will surely spark debate after the credits roll.  Despite not receiving the critical accolades that other Bergman films have received, it remains one of his most memorable films.",

            "content": "Winter Light is among the more 'pure' Bergman films. There are no distractions. The plot is cut-down and streamlined to bare essentials in a story that takes on themes critical to the director's total output - the practical balance between life, faith, truth, and order in an imperfect world. A aging priest, having become familiar with cruelty and despair, finds himself in a crisis of faith as he and those around him engage in strained debates on the nature of God and their own existences, particularly in the context of their own lack of influence over their own fates. Religion, long thought infallible, is instead depicted as a mental crutch to stabilize oneself against the crushing randomness and unpredictability of life; this small Swedish hamlet has virtually no faithful in it (which is part of where Bergman draws his greatest power from, the obligatory but insincere attempts by Bj\u00f6rnstrand's jaded pastor to console others when he himself has barely a tenuous idea of what faith is anymore). Excessively bleak, almost to the detriment of the film, in that every character is at such a low point at the start of the film that there isn't much farther for them to fall over the course of the runtime. It's all anxious handwringing with stoic faces, but I guess that's the point.\n\nIt's a classic piece on a universal theme, but it's hard to shake the feeling that if this film were released today it would be very easy to dismiss it as pretentious and simplistic based on its boldfaced nature. However, it's Bergman, and while he's hardly subtle in Winter Light, the final product is the furthest thing from weak. In fact, you should be prepared to get sucked down in an existential mire. (4/5)",

            "content": "Winter Light opens on a congregation of people reacting to a sermon in varying ways, some ambivalent, some falling asleep, some moved, some operating purely out of routine. The congregation leaves and in the absence of human contact, the pastor, Tomas, sits alone and considers god's silence, feeling spurned and remorseful. He closes himself off from relationships due to his lack of existential purpose, pushing away his loved ones and retreating into his despair. A man feels the same way, hopeless in an environment of nuclear paranoia, and kills himself. Tomas and his lover wrangle with each other, one open to love and the other completely opposed to something so substantive in a world of pointlessness, until they both decide to continue on for the sake of it. Tomas continues to serve as pastor despite his lack of faith.\n\nReligion is arbitrary and empty, begging the question of why we continue to live in an unsure world where all we have to go by are stories and silence. We're indoctrinated at a young age and go from there with the ingrained feeling that to forsake your god is to die. But ultimately, if god does exist, god forsook us first.\n\nBergman addresses these ideas by bringing his signature subtext to the forefront, putting aside filmic modes of communication and allowing his flesh and blood characters to do the work for him by way of speech and interaction. The result is his most honest, emotional, and genuinely affecting film, a spiritual sibling to Antonioni's L'Eclisse in its assessment of human relations set against a backdrop of nuclear holocaust and its positioning of man as existing in an existential contradiction that is ultimately unknowable.\n\nBergman said he found himself through Winter Light, a sentiment easy to identify with after having experienced the result of his crisis of identity.",

Winter light was bergman's favorite film for many reasons: his father was a pastor and bergman's religious touch is all over the film, and he identified himself with Gunnar bjornstrand's character (pastor Tomas ericsson).",

He performs the mass very rigidly and there are only a few people in the congregation, and that's important because that sets the tone. The minister is not feeling well due to a cold and he learns one of the parishioners who attended the mass needs to see him afterwards. The parishioner is very depressed and is paranoid about the future. Unfortunately for him , when he does he does meet with the minister the priest does not do a good job listening to him because we learn the minister is very depressed himself but never publicly shows it. The minister became a minister because his parents expected him to become one. We learn the minister is doubtful of God's love and/or purposes and unfortunately confuses the parishioner in his time of need, which leads to tragic results. We learn the priest is in heavy emotional pain because his beloved wife had passed away 4 years earlier and that he is cold-hearted and even resentful of the woman who now loves him and is trying to save him. The ending is absolutely spellbinding. His assistant is describing the pain of Christ right before the crucifixion in the last hours of his life, by saying the true pain of Jesus was not physical, but emotional, mental ,and psychic pain by describing how exactly the disciples disappointed and frustrated Jesus by not understanding Jesus at all, and how that must of felt devastating  to Jesus. And everything he says describes the priest's inner torments exactly. This is the film Bergman was born to make. This is his masterpiece when all his profound themes gelled together perfectly.",

Bergman wrote and directed this film that few films can match in its vision of how our faith works. Also, it is one of Bergman's most boldly philosophical films. The film follows a Catholic priest, Tomas, who practices the daily routines of his faith, but is so internally worried about God's silence that it actually drives him to be physically unwell. The narrative is actually very simple, amounting to mainly just conversations about Tomas' faith, and faith in general. The best of which occur between Marta and Tomas; the scene where Tomas reads Marta's letter is one of the most profound scenes I have ever seen. And Bergman creates a cold and harsh atmosphere that represents Tomas' nihilistic view of the world during his struggle with God's silence. But then there is the scene where the young organ player talks to Tomas about Christ's struggle with God's silence on the cross, and if I were religious, this would honestly be the most spiritually uplifting scene I have ever seen. This film was the film that really exposed me to Bergman's brilliance as a writer, and his unparalleled brilliance as a visual artist. It is definitely essential viewing.",
