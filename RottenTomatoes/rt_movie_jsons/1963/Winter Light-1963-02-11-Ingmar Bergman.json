After failing to provide comfort to Jonas (Max von Sydow), a depressed parishioner worried about the threat of an atomic war, he turns his back on the only person who cares for him, Marta (Ingrid Thulin), a lonely schoolteacher.  Winter Light is as somber and stark a film as Ingmar Bergman has ever created…and that's saying something.  Beautifully shot by Bergman regular Sven Nykvist, Winter Light is filled with haunting images and insightful dialogue that will surely spark debate after the credits roll.  Despite not receiving the critical accolades that other Bergman films have received, it remains one of his most memorable films.",

            "content": "Winter Light is among the more 'pure' Bergman films. There are no distractions. The plot is cut-down and streamlined to bare essentials in a story that takes on themes critical to the director's total output - the practical balance between life, faith, truth, and order in an imperfect world. A aging priest, having become familiar with cruelty and despair, finds himself in a crisis of faith as he and those around him engage in strained debates on the nature of God and their own existences, particularly in the context of their own lack of influence over their own fates. Religion, long thought infallible, is instead depicted as a mental crutch to stabilize oneself against the crushing randomness and unpredictability of life; this small Swedish hamlet has virtually no faithful in it (which is part of where Bergman draws his greatest power from, the obligatory but insincere attempts by Björnstrand's jaded pastor to console others when he himself has barely a tenuous idea of what faith is anymore). Excessively bleak, almost to the detriment of the film, in that every character is at such a low point at the start of the film that there isn't much farther for them to fall over the course of the runtime. It's all anxious handwringing with stoic faces, but I guess that's the point.\n\nIt's a classic piece on a universal theme, but it's hard to shake the feeling that if this film were released today it would be very easy to dismiss it as pretentious and simplistic based on its boldfaced nature. However, it's Bergman, and while he's hardly subtle in Winter Light, the final product is the furthest thing from weak. In fact, you should be prepared to get sucked down in an existential mire. (4/5)",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Our Daily Free Stream: Ingmar Bergman - Winter Light (engl. subt.). Als die Filmkunstbar Fitzcarraldo noch in der Revaler Strasse lag, verstarb Ingmar Bergman. Bis dahin fragten nur wenige nach seinen Filmen - das änderte sich bis heute schlagartig. Denke ich an seinen Tod, verbinde ich den immer mit Nattvardsgästerna aus seiner \"Silence Of god\" Trilogie. Warum? Nattvardsgästerna handelt von einem Pfarrer, der nicht in der Lage ist, einem Gemeindemitglied die Angst vor dem nuklearen Holocaust zu nehmen. Eine Frau, die ihn trösten könnte, weist er zurück. Die Bilder habe ich noch heute deutlich vor Augen. Wie Bergman und sein Kameramann Sven Nykvest in einer Dorfkirche das Sonnenlicht auf seinem Weg durch den Raum festhalten. Nattvardsgästerna - ein Film über das Licht. Ich habe das Werk jetzt wieder gesehen und war überwältigt von seiner Kraft, seiner Trostlosigkeit! So viel komplexer als ich es in Erinnerung behielt! Hier geht es nicht nur um das Schweigen Gottes, sondern eines Mannes: Pastor Tomas Ericsson (Gunnar Bjornstrand). Er spricht zu uns, ist aber ausser Stande, sich oder anderen Mut zu spenden. Daneben treten auf: Jonas (Max Von Sydow), besessen vom Bösen in der Welt und Marta (Ingrid Thulin), eine Lehrerin, die den Pastor aufrichtig liebt. Als Dank empfängt sie einzig Kälte. Zwei Menschen, die sich tief verletzen. Es ist auch ein Film über Vertrauen. Algot (Allan Edwall, durch einen Unfall entstellt, scheint der Einzige zu sein, der dem Wort Gottes tatsächlich etwas für sein Leben abgewinnen kann. Visuell wird das mit rigoroser Schlichtheit dargeboten. Nykvest nutzt nicht einen Schwenk der Kamera, um einen Effekt zu erzielen. Er bleibt der Beobachter. Er zeigt. Pastor Tomas lächelt nie. Er wirkt krank, mehr noch: Kalt und nicht in der Lage, mitzufühlen. Jonas Ängsten, die Welt würde enden durch den atomaren Endschlag, begegnet Tomas in Floskeln: Wir müssen in Gott vertrauen. Während er das sagt, bemerken wir, wie sehr seine Hände zittern. Es gibt aber viel mehr als nur die Stille Gottes. Tomas schweigt gegenüber Marta. Diejenigen, die auf Hilfe hoffen, sie empfangen nur Zurückweisung und Schweigen. Ich habe mich gefragt, wie viel Bergman in der Figur des Pastores steckt? Bergman, der selbst mehrfach verheiratet war, jedoch kein Glück fand. Ist das der Aufschrei eines Künstlers, dessen Leben genauso kalt schien? Der nicht geben konnte? Wie autobiographisch Nattvardsgästerna tatsächlich ist, werden wir wohl nie herausfinden. Im Herzen ist es ein Film über einen Mann, der sich für Gott hält und versagt.",

            "content": "Winter Light opens on a congregation of people reacting to a sermon in varying ways, some ambivalent, some falling asleep, some moved, some operating purely out of routine. The congregation leaves and in the absence of human contact, the pastor, Tomas, sits alone and considers god's silence, feeling spurned and remorseful. He closes himself off from relationships due to his lack of existential purpose, pushing away his loved ones and retreating into his despair. A man feels the same way, hopeless in an environment of nuclear paranoia, and kills himself. Tomas and his lover wrangle with each other, one open to love and the other completely opposed to something so substantive in a world of pointlessness, until they both decide to continue on for the sake of it. Tomas continues to serve as pastor despite his lack of faith.\n\nReligion is arbitrary and empty, begging the question of why we continue to live in an unsure world where all we have to go by are stories and silence. We're indoctrinated at a young age and go from there with the ingrained feeling that to forsake your god is to die. But ultimately, if god does exist, god forsook us first.\n\nBergman addresses these ideas by bringing his signature subtext to the forefront, putting aside filmic modes of communication and allowing his flesh and blood characters to do the work for him by way of speech and interaction. The result is his most honest, emotional, and genuinely affecting film, a spiritual sibling to Antonioni's L'Eclisse in its assessment of human relations set against a backdrop of nuclear holocaust and its positioning of man as existing in an existential contradiction that is ultimately unknowable.\n\nBergman said he found himself through Winter Light, a sentiment easy to identify with after having experienced the result of his crisis of identity.",

The parishioner is very depressed and is paranoid about the future. Unfortunately for him , when he does he does meet with the minister the priest does not do a good job listening to him because we learn the minister is very depressed himself but never publicly shows it. The minister became a minister because his parents expected him to become one. We learn the minister is doubtful of God's love and/or purposes and unfortunately confuses the parishioner in his time of need, which leads to tragic results. We learn the priest is in heavy emotional pain because his beloved wife had passed away 4 years earlier and that he is cold-hearted and even resentful of the woman who now loves him and is trying to save him. The ending is absolutely spellbinding. His assistant is describing the pain of Christ right before the crucifixion in the last hours of his life, by saying the true pain of Jesus was not physical, but emotional, mental ,and psychic pain by describing how exactly the disciples disappointed and frustrated Jesus by not understanding Jesus at all, and how that must of felt devastating  to Jesus. And everything he says describes the priest's inner torments exactly. This is the film Bergman was born to make. This is his masterpiece when all his profound themes gelled together perfectly.",

The film follows a Catholic priest, Tomas, who practices the daily routines of his faith, but is so internally worried about God's silence that it actually drives him to be physically unwell. The narrative is actually very simple, amounting to mainly just conversations about Tomas' faith, and faith in general. The best of which occur between Marta and Tomas; the scene where Tomas reads Marta's letter is one of the most profound scenes I have ever seen. And Bergman creates a cold and harsh atmosphere that represents Tomas' nihilistic view of the world during his struggle with God's silence. But then there is the scene where the young organ player talks to Tomas about Christ's struggle with God's silence on the cross, and if I were religious, this would honestly be the most spiritually uplifting scene I have ever seen. This film was the film that really exposed me to Bergman's brilliance as a writer, and his unparalleled brilliance as a visual artist. It is definitely essential viewing.",

In eighty minutes, with few characters, fewer locations, the inquisitive but unobtrusive eye of cinematographer Sven Nykvist (the use of light here, as suggested by the title, is central and powerful), and a sound design centered on stillness, Bergman seems to encompass the depth and breadth of human existence and all the weight and wonder of the cosmos.",

Es un hombre solitario que sufre una profunda crisis espiritual y cuya vida carece de sentido. Incluso el amor que le profesa la maestra Marta se ha vuelto para él una carga insoportable. Su situación se agrava al verse incapaz de ofrecer ayuda alguna a una pareja de campesinos que acuden a él para pedirle consejo. Cuando, poco después, el campesino se suicida, Thomas se encuentra al borde del abismo y ya nada podrá llenar su vacío interior.",
