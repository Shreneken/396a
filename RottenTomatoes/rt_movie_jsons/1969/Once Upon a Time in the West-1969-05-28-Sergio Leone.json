He sends his henchman Frank (Henry Fonda) to scare the land's owner, McBain (Frank Wolff), but Frank kills him instead and pins it on a known bandit, Cheyenne (Jason Robards). Meanwhile, a mysterious gunslinger with a score to settle (Charles Bronson) and McBain's new wife, Jill (Claudia Cardinale), arrive in town.",

The plot is engrossing, the acting superb, the cinematography breathtaking, and Ennio Morricone's musical score is absolutely gorgeous.  The plot is multi-layered yet rather simple, and Henry Fonda - for the first time in his long career - plays a nasty villain, and does it with such conviction that it's remarkable.  Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are also superb.  I don't want to give away any of the plot details, but the film will grab and hold your interest like few films do.  Highly recommended.",

Does it contain some of the worst dubbing ever, at least in the English version?  Yup, it sure does.  Does Charles Bronson's harmonica playing make you want to punch yourself in the ears repeatedly.  Yes, it does.  Is the storyline needlessly obtuse?  Sure.  Despite all of this, nobody captures the feel of the Old West like Leone.  You can almost taste the grit in your teeth and the sun burning your neck.  Leone and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli (a holdover from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly) use plenty of creative crane shots and tracking shots to capture the spectacular vistas, making the entire film a visual wonder.  If you can ignore the flaws, it is a film worth watching at least once.",

The sound, the look, the feel of the American West is captured forever, in this sprawling revenge tragedy. If you love Tombstone, Star Wars, The Unforgiven, Red Dead Redemption, or Kung Fu--you need to see this film.\n\nBe patient, it's a slow burn. Not much is wasted. Enjoy the scope of the town scenes, and consider the difficulty of managing so many actors at once, on film. It's even a li'l bit sexy, without being uber-offensive to modern sensibilities. Women had it shit back then--don't look for a sugar coating. Wanna see a few kids get murdered? Trigger warning!

The movies I have seen of his are visually gorgeous with superb scores and interesting stories and characters. Once Upon a Time in the West is no exception. It is long and slow, but I think the film was deliberately paced like that.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West does take a lot of risks, including improvising the action around the score's moods. This was a risk that paid off. The story is rich and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking and beautifully written. Leone also proved what a fine director he was by directing so wonderfully on this film.\n\nThe characters are great and quite complex, and are further advantaged by being wonderfully portrayed. There is the brutish gunfighter, the beautiful widow, the mysterious harmonica player and the sympathetic outlaw. Henry Fonda particularly does brilliantly in the role of Frank. The visuals once again are exquisite and quite grandiose in its scope and beauty, while Ennio Morricone's wonderfully operatic-like score fully justifies why he is considered one of the all-time great film composers.\n\nAll in all, a big and bold western and one unlike any other. It also took risks, ones which could have gone horribly wrong but due to the evident work and care of all involved, they paid off. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" is an intimate, thoughtful and riveting spaghetti western that showcases the filmmaker's passionate love for the genre. With his fifth feature, Leone crafted a mesmerizing love letter to his favorite genre that has stood the test of time as a modern classic. Using spellbinding cinematography, Leone immerses viewers into the intense rivalry between two teams of gunslingers in a town in Wild West. Leone has always been an expert at employing extreme close-ups in his movies, and \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" is no exception. Leone effectively employs close-ups to convey heated rivalry between competitive gunslingers with nothing but hate for each other. Leone exhibits strong control over production design, editing and music, using such departments to craft an unforgettable cinematic experinece. Leone's screenplay is also sensational, and expertly uses subtle symbolism to give greater significance to oft-ignored objects in the Wild West. It's hard to not praise marvelous performances from the cast. Henry Fonda delivers one of the finest performances of his career as Frank. With alluring expressions, he conveys bravery, frustrations and resentments of a gunslinger that seeks revenge against his foes in the Wild West. Jason Robards is equally excellent in the role of an intimidating cowboy that inspires fear in the town without speaking a single word. Despite dearth of dialogue, Robards imbues intensity into the movie in one of his best roles. The final, most notable cast standout is Claudia Cardinale. As a seductive prostitute mistreated by men, she brings rare feminist energy to the male-dominated genre. Although \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" is undeniably an unforgettable classic western, ultimately it isn't a flawless movie. At nearly 3 hours, it suffers from an extended running-time that tests viewers' patience. While the film is never boring, certain scenes could have been trimmed to make a more engaging movie for modern audiences. Nevertheless, fans of classic westerns will definitely enjoy \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" and so will movie-goers seeking interested in old-fashioned entertainment. At a time when Westerns seldom attract audiences to multiplexes anymore, it's a soul-stirring tribute to a forgotten era in film history that deserves high noon recognition even if memories of truly gritty cowboys have faded from good, bad and ugly movies over centuries.",

            "content": "In the wake of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, at the height of his notoriety as master of the spaghetti western, Sergio Leone moved to America and intended to explore different genres. Problem was, all the major studios wanted him to continue making dusty pistol-wranglers. He obliged with this; a somber, atmospheric piece that touches all the familiar hallmarks but lacks the heart, passion and tenacity of his preceding \"Dollars Trilogy.\"\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West depicts a cutthroat competition between a posh businessman, a nasty outlaw, two vigilantes and a widow over the development rights to a crucial piece of land in the middle of nowhere. That won't be the case for long, however, as progress demands a continental railroad and the only source of water in a fifty-mile radius lies on this property. Everyone wants a slice of the inevitable riches, if not the whole pie. Matched with a characteristically stirring, yowling musical score from Ennio Morricone, outfitted with big-budget equipment and name actors, the film is positively drenched with character. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the opening scene, where Leone wordlessly dwells on three would-be assassins as they patiently await their mark. We don't need dialog to appreciate how grimy and low-down the trio is, loose with their morals as well as their manners, and the dense ten minutes of their mini-arc wraps us up like a smallpox blanket.\n\nIn such a bite-sized dose, the restraint is delicious. Leone applies it to the entire sprawling, 160-minute film. It's all syrupy texture with very little concrete storytelling, a drastic example of mood over substance. I love the idea of Henry Fonda playing against-type as a scummy, conniving scoundrel. Charles Bronson, in a role clearly written for Clint Eastwood, deals almost exclusively in piercing squints and creepy harmonica riffs. Claudia Cardinale is breathtakingly beautiful as a recently-widowed spitfire with oodles of defiant willpower. The cast seems well-primed for a wonderful story, but instead they loiter about, rubbing elbows and making threats, while the plot rambles and sprays mundane, cryptic implications. It takes forever and it barely goes anywhere. Clearly, this is the work of a talented director who'd lost interest in making just one type of movie. I think Leone mailed it in.",

            "content": "Sergio Leone's epic saga is an entertaining and well shot adventure that is unfortunately dragged down by plot-convolution and more than a healthy dose of misogyny. The plot, on paper, is a basic one about a rich outlaw, Frank (Henry Ford), killing and conniving to get thirty-something acres of land that crosses the path of the planned railroad line. In walks nameless Charles Bronson, who is after Frank for immediately unknown reasons. There are other characters, including French bombshell Claudia Cardinale as the freshly-married-then-widowed Jill, who is the rightful owner of the property in question. Jason Robards steals the show as the outlaw-with-a-heart-of-gold, Manuel \"Cheyenne\" (oof) Gutierrez. \nWhile beautiful to watch and is ultimately entertaining, the movie runs into moments where it's trying to be too edgy, specifically putting Jill into situations where she's being controlled by men that don't necessarily make sense. The performances are not bad - Bronson is Bronson - but a couple of hard tonal shifts left me scratching my head and wondering why they were included. \nThe plot is meaty, and the twist and explanations delivered smoothly. The lesson is a hard one about the West, and the intentions of men that does translate well to today. Leone was a master of showing and not telling, while implementing strong cinematic shots and styles into his delivery. I'm glad I finally watched this film, but I understand why it's not talked about more.\n\nMy grade: C",

Loooonnnggg, lingering closeups (complete sometimes with jerky camera work), repeated screen-filling faces, back and forth.  A dearth of dialogue that MIGHT help explain something (total script was probably 5 pages).  Watching this one was like trying to run underwater.  I was thinking, several times, that both the director and the cinematographer must have been on downers during filming.\nAnd, of course, the obligatory sexist casting.  Woman as whore (or bread-baker, take your choice).  It was refreshing, I guess, to see Henry Fonda as a bad guy and Charles Bronson as a good guy.  I'm guessing this was all a warm-up for Leone's other ones, The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly.  Chalk this one up as, at least, the last of the three.",

In some scenes, I really liked this as it allowed me to take in all of the emotions that certain scenes tried to capture. The movie does a convincing job of recreating this world and I can always appreciate that in any sort of historical backdrop, but particularly in the Western genre.

It became a trilogy for pure storytelling under simplistic realism of epic periods landmarking through history that he found fitting for his craftsmanship that will buildup towards the New York gangster streets modernly outside from the western deserts, hence the beginning of his remodified style. The desired casting of Henry Fonda was what brought Leone back into the west and to reconsider the initial deal he refused, which resulted in understandable reasoning regarding commitment despite the experienced mastery and frequently familiar collaborators that got him through his reluctant return. Still a masterful classic as the genre was looking towards the setting sun, driven by recognizably praiseworthy production merits under progressive filmmaking through fine developmental characterization, even if the new approach of updated style may not cooperate with those merits due to the pacing that subtly saying the heart wasn't exactly put into the effort albeit the signature.

After seeing it more than once, I can certainly understand the sentiment.  Westerns aren't my thing per say, but I have studied movies and seen quite a few of them as well.  \nOnce upon a time might well be Sergio Leone's masterpiece.  This is the same guy who effectively established spaghetti westerns and may have done more to escalate Clint Eastwood's career than anyone.  However this movie featured Charles Bronson in one of earliest roles.  The rest of the cast is pretty stacked too headlined by mega star at the time, one Henry Fonda in what may well have been one of his best roles.  Fonda establishes a type of classic dark character that seems to reappear later played by Yule Brenner in Westworld, which in turn can be said to be a model for Arnold's Terminator.\nOnce Upon a time in the West may well have had great influence on art and cinema.  The opening scene is as quiet and boring as s movie gets yet it's done with the direction and purpose of a master.  Viewers can hear every backdrop noise as if they are actually there giving us a curious view of what VR creates later.  The sound and attention to detail is worthy of a master painting.  The opening scene while seemingly slow creates tension and a sense of foreboding that does activate.  \nBad guys in the movie appeared more ominous and real, as if they leap off the screen and are breathing down your neck kind of impression.\nThe ending is foreshadowed br closes on a personal note as if the entire act was planned out by the hero.  The movie is typical of the big landscape westerns of the era that highlight the massive size of the west while still building and intense interesting story with great drama, strong characters, and exciting action.\nIt may have or may not be the top western but I can agree it would at least qualify as a good candidate.",

We know so much of them and their motivations without knowing much of their backstory.

The movie comes so close to crossing the line of being problematic but doesn't.

            "content": "I love epics. Old and new, featuring Charlton Heston or Chris Pratt, I love them all. I love their sweeping vistas, their perfect costumes, their elaborate sets. I love that feeling you get thinking \"how long did it take them to do THAT?\". But after watching this movie I would like to posit a question: Is Ben-Hur your favorite movie? What do you feel watching Lawrence of Arabia? Have you watched Avengers: Infinity War outside of theaters? For all of their beautiful landscapes, perfect cinematography, and even expert craft, would you watch them more than once? Exactly. Lawrence of Arabia was perfectly made. It's landscape stunning, it's editing was unique and breathtaking, its direction by David Lean on point. But after intermission I couldn't take it anymore. Maybe it's just me, but let me posit my reasoning for a moment. When a director is supervising the costumes, the set design, hundreds of extras, all in a remote location, the characterization is not on their mind. For in every desert, Colosseum, and mountaintop there is a person. There is a mind, a heart and a soul. This is what made me so happy to see Once Upon a Time in the West, for I am young, and revisiting the old \"classic\" that enthralled a generation feels like some kind of responsibility. So when I see a movie with style but no substance, presentation but no flavor, I feel disappointed. A movie like this encapsulates a culture, it snapshots a place in time. That's why I believe epics like Avengers: Endgame need to learn a lesson from Sergio Leone. Even though I loved when Captain America stood up, when all the Avengers assembled, and when Iron Man finally snapped his fingers, it couldn't beat Once Upon a Time in the West's opening credits. This is because while others boast impressive landscape shots and captivating group shots, none of them can boast a shot as powerful as a close up on Henry Fonda's eyes. Sergio Leone understands that people truly don't want to see grandiose sets, they want to see people. When he shoots a man riding into the distance, he remembers why the man is going, not simply where he is going. His extensive use of close-ups reveal this. It is common when watching to come upon a shot of only eyes, the background blurred behind them. In my recollection of this film I do not remember the crane shot of the bustling western town, and neither do you. You remember Henry Fonda's glassy eyes, the sweat collecting on his forehead. The logistics of shooting the train or the hundreds of extras do not phase you when you have a real human story to latch on to. So when you go out and shoot a man looking upon a sunset, don't focus on the sunset, focus on the man.",

            "content": "Captivating character acting elevated by slick editing and stellar direction!\n\nSergio Leone's Western epic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) is a masterpiece of longform storytelling. Leone's choices keep you engaged for the massive 3 hour run-time for Once Upon a Time in the West. Leone's direction is a realistic, gritty, greasy wonder of quiet sound design to hear every ambient noise for atmosphere. You are always unnerved as a shootout can occur at any moment. You will be on edge the entire time!\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West is a crime story, understated romance, and revenge tale all in one! Sergio Leone's writing is full of deep characterization wherein each lead has complex motivations and perspective. Morality is ambiguous as each person is out for their own. Jill wants freedom and purpose, Frank wants power and money, Cheyenne wants money and land, and Harmonica wants revenge and solace. The dialogue is pithy and memorable as no line is wasted in this verbal desert. Few words are spoken, but much is meant with biting insults, witty comebacks, funny jokes, and profound remarks abundant within Leone's script. I find it cool that Sergio Leone came up with Once Upon a Time in the West's story alongside Dario Argento and Bernardo Bertolucci.\n\nI must mention legendary composer Ennio Morricone's score to Once Upon a Time in the West is fantastic. Mesmerizing quiet melodies underscore each scene. He leaves pauses and quiet passages to emphasize certain lines of dialogue or an important plot point. Morricone's flute, piano, and of course, harmonica is all used to exhilarate and entertain the audience. The film's main theme is unforgettable and as epic as his work on The Good, The Bad, & They Ugly.\n\nSimilarly, Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography gives you both the large scope or the landscape as well as revealing eye close ups. Shots of the vast desert are as impressive as his close encounter shots of characters just talking. You are always aware of the clever and intriguing angles and camera placement.\n\nLikewise, Nino Baragli's editing choices are astounding and clever. Morton dies poetically crawling towards the water that he longed for the entire film with a neat cut to his dry lips never touching the water. Also, the cut of Frank shooting the boy into the train smoke is beautiful and haunting. The film's cuts all feel deliberate and thought out. Once Upon a Time in the West contains some of the finest editing ever captured on film.\n\nClaudia Cardinale is a lovely heroine named Jill McBain. She is striking with her dark looks and forward attitude. She really carries her acting weight next to the three titans leading the film. Charles Bronson is incredibly cool as the near silent, haunted gunfighter Harmonica. Bronson knows when to speak and how to deliver a line with tremendous weight and undeniable gravitas. His presence is felt whenever he is on screen. Bronson's all white outfit, quick draw skills, and thoughtful expressiveness make Harmonica a killer character, not unlike Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name from Leone's Western trilogy. It's no wonder why Sergio Leone wanted Bronson in that part too.\n\nSimilarly, Henry Fonda makes an iconic turn as the villain Frank. His dirty make-up, black clothes, trigger finger, and sarcastic comments are perfectly loathsome building up the cruelty of Frank. Fonda captivates you entirely with every glare and line. Likewise, you cannot forget Jason Robards' performance as Cheyenne the criminal. His sweaty, bearded rapscallion is likable in a grisly way. Fonda and Robards hold your attention at all times.\n\nLastly, Gabriele Ferzetti is excellent as the crutch bound Morton. His pained anguish is palpable and Morton's longing for the sea made sympathetic due to Ferzetti's acting prowess.\n\nSimply put, Once Upon a Time in the West is one of the finest films to come out of the Western genre. It's as interesting and masterful as Leone's other Western trilogy and up there with Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid as the best Western ever made.",

My only criticism is the plot involving a railroad baron intimidating the people occupying the land on his route is about as cliched a Western plot as they come.

It is hard to think of any Leone movie without also thinking of the Morricone soundtrack.\n\nI also want to protest RottenTomatoes' Tomatometer. Roger Ebert's review, the only one negatively impacting the score, was really a lukewarm review, not a negative one. Ebert later referred to Once Upon a Time in the West as a \"masterpiece\" in his second review of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly--which also might shed light on why he didn't recognize how good this movie was in 1968.",

But what I didn't expect to see is one of the best, and most profound, contemplative movies ever made!\n\nSignifying the end of the Old West, Sergio Leone loaded his near-three-hour sprawling epic with symbols. The symbolism is seen in almost every aspect of the movie; the setting, the costumes, the music, and most importantly, the characters. In fact, each character stand for an iconographic Western role. But Leone did humanize them through his melodrama, and the result is that all the characters became some of the most interesting and compelling characters ever!\n\nWhat amazed me is how rich the plot seems despite its simplicity. And as convoluted as the narrative sounds, the movie never lost me. That's simply because the story is actually pretty simple, but the sophisticated themes and symbolic characters gave it mythic feeling.\n\nAside from its remarkable opening scene, which became one of my all-time favorites, I found the first hour of unbearably tedious! I usually don't mind watching movies with a deliberate pace, but almost the entire first hour gave us nothing but glances of each of the interesting characters that I totally invested in afterwards. The extremely strong, compelling, sympathetic, interesting and memorable characters portrayed by a spectacular charismatic cast definitely made me forget how bored I was during the first act, but also definitely didn't make me forget that I was about to fall asleep a couple of times!\n\n(8.5/10)",

Claudia Cardinale is simply stunning and her acting is nothing but captivating: her eyes are so full of emotions that it's basically impossible not to admire her. She's a classy actress and this movie is the definitive proof. Fonda, Bronson and the rest of the cast is, again, perfect: it seems as if the perfect alchemy was reached during the shooting days.

            "content": "Coming in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, and giving us vast canvases of the old west, this film from director Sergio Leone is truly epic in scope.  The cinematography is fantastic, and while marveling over the wide shots, you really feel as dry and dusty as the characters.  The overall tone screams old west, and while it takes awhile to get there, the final 30 minutes or so is stirring, and memorable.  The film is legendary in reputation and adored by many, so I'll tread as lightly as possible in my criticism.  I just found it fell a little short in its casting, in its muddled middle portion, and its treatment of Claudia Cardinale's character.  \n\nI'll start with Henry Fonda, who is a mixed bag for me.  I liked the contrast of his blue eyes with his dark character, and he certainly does things which emphasize his cruelty - killing a child in cold blood, knocking down his crippled boss, and committing rape.  It's a decent performance, but to me Fonda didn't quite fit in the part.  Not enough grit to be believable, and at 63, too old.  \n\nCharles Bronson is similarly 'just ok', and he's certainly no Clint Eastwood.  It may be unfair to compare Leone to his other work, but I liked 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' much more, because of Eastwood, a more compelling plot, and that extraordinary musical refrain.  The harmonica we get here kind of pales in comparison.  \n\nWhile it's fantastic to see the beautiful Cardinale in the film, the rape scene made me cringe, and not because of the act itself, but because how Leone captures it.   Cardinale is supposed to be pretending to go along with Fonda to survive, so some of what we see is to be expected, but to see no fear or disgust, and just waves of rapture instead, is sickening.  Earlier Cardinale says that Cheyenne (Jason Robards) could bend her over the table and have his men have their way with her, and all she'd have to do is wash off with hot water afterwards.  It could be the voice of the hardened prostitute talking, but the overall impression of rape this scene and the other give is that it's just a sex act, one a woman may actually enjoy, instead of an act of great violence with devastating consequences.  So we have a male fantasy of rape to go alone with that of the fantasy of the fearless, cool gunslinger, the latter of which has plenty of Americans wanting to walk around carrying a gun, thinking they fit this image.\n\nMy apologies if this is coming across unbalanced in the other direction, and too negative.  There are plenty of great moments and great shots, both of the scenery and in close-ups.  The relationship between Fonda and Bronson is effective, and as in Leone's other works, they share the mindset of the hardened killer, understanding one another as they circle each other's path throughout the movie.  While we certainly have an idea of the backstory behind Bronson's character, the reveal towards the end is a powerful moment.  If you like westerns, this is must-see.   If you don't, I don't think I'd pick this one to try to convert you.",

It's impeccably scored, featuring a bevy of memorable cues for each noteworthy character. It's got an incredible filmmaker behind its camera, without a shadow of a doubt.

Rather the omission of Dollars stalwart Clint Eastwood. \nI needn't have had those thoughts. Charles Bronson appears to fill his role as the gunslinger with little vocabulary  (rather a harmonica) with ease. \nYou can see some of the Bronson hallmarks of revenge in his character incidentally called Harmonica!\nThe music from composer Ennio Morricone is excellent again. A blend of late sixties/seventies guitar strings with the harmonica influence.\nI watched with the television on high volume to appreciate the soundtrack and some excellent sound effects such as rusty railway station signs blowing etc. during tense stand offs opitimised by staring of characters!\nThe stand offs do drag on at times and inevitably the run time of the film goes up. One of my few complaints.\nThe polished appearance of the film whilst noticeable goes against the lower budget grittiness of Leone's Dollars trilogy.\nThe American locations are used to full effect as the story revolves around the expansion of railroads.\nAt times I felt I was spotting excellent actors from other films I have enjoyed such as Henry Fonda and Gabrielle Ferzetti (On Her Majesty's Secret Service).",

            "content": "I liked the Man with No Name trilogy, and I greatly appreciated Sergio Leone\u0092s style in those films. What in the world changed here?? I\u0092m just baffled by this film, because I expected to love it and about halfway through I was begging for it to end. Let me start by complimenting the things I did like in Once Upon a Time in the West, before I break into my litany of complaints. Charles Bronson was great as the soft-spoken new guy in town, and James Robards was also great as the more vocal bandit who works with Bronson. The visuals were wonderful because they constructed some amazing sets, found remarkable locations, and also did some expert cinematography to capture it all. It also successfully pulls off that classic Western vibe that makes Leone\u0092s films so special. Now onto the problems:\n\n1) The music and sound effects are so obnoxiously repetitive. Perhaps the themes were well written, but I feel like Ennio Morricone didn\u0092t compose enough music, so instead I just had to hear the same refrain repeated ad nauseum. There were so many scenes in the film that are silent and they are backed up with one line of music or one sound that simply won\u0092t stop. At a certain point during all of these scenes I found myself wanting to mute the TV just to make it stop. I literally got a headache from watching the film, which probably isn\u0092t a good sign.\n\n2) To describe the pace of Once Upon a Time in the West as glacial is insulting to glaciers everywhere. This movie has a runtime of nearly three hours, and I swear two of those hours are made up of people silently staring at one another. There was more than once that I burst out and actually said to the characters on screen \u0093DO SOMETHING!\u0094 I understood it when Leone used these moments of quiet to build tension in a gunfight, and when it was used in that context it worked in this movie too. But there were these same moments of pause in almost everything people did throughout the film.\n\n3) For some reason it felt like they were intentionally trying to hide the plot from me. I\u0092m all for a film that allows the story to slowly reveal itself as you watch, but in Once Upon a Time in the West I was getting almost no revelation. There\u0092s hardly any exposition, and when there is it seems to come out of nowhere. I eventually just gave up and looked to Wikipedia for a plot synopsis so I wouldn\u0092t be forced to rewind the film in an attempt to decipher what was happening. I was seriously annoyed that the film made me work so hard to decipher it.\n\n4) I do not understand the motivations of any character in this film. No one behaves in a manner that I find logical. This is almost an extension of my previous point because if the plot made sense then perhaps I would comprehend why people were doing things within that plot. But constantly people just start to do things with no explanation, and what they do seems totally out of character based on what I thought we knew about them. There also were no clear heroes or villains in my eyes so I was frustrated that I cared about no one.\n\n5) Finally, I did not like Once Upon a Time in the West because it has no flow as a film. We constantly jump from one scene to the next with little or no connective tissue to help me adjust. I kept thinking I accidentally hit a button to skip the DVD forward or something, because I was regularly wondering \u0093How did we get here?\u0094 This is probably why I found the narrative of the film so weak, because I couldn\u0092t follow what was happening for more than a scene at a time.\n\nI think there\u0092s probably something in this film I\u0092m missing. Clearly it is well-loved and critically acclaimed, so I must be the one who\u0092s off base. I imagine, now that I have read the plot, I could probably go back and things might fall into place a little bit more. However, I don\u0092t really feel like dedicating the hours it would take to watch it again, and I don\u0092t want another headache.",

Sergio goes from the snappy Kurosawa inspired Man with No Name Trilogy that was know for snappy action and over the top (but brilliant) music to Once Upon a Time in the West.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West is much more dialed back and ironically similar to Kurosawa in a way of letting long framing shots dictate immersion that's eventually cut by action. Rather than letting action drive the shots. Combine this with a haunting melody and a somewhat abstract plot and you get a movie that's sort of unlike anything else.\n\nIt's long, it's slow, it's immersive, it's beautiful, and everyone takes away something different from their viewing. \n\nWhat I found quite interesting was how each character evolves during the story which is something we don't really get in the Man with No Name Trilogy. \n\nSpoilers ahead\n------\nThe Hero starts off being elusive, and ends as a sort of blank slate after his revenge is complete\nThe Villain starts as an evil killer looking to get into the railroad business, but at the end Bronson's character drives him to accept that they have a destiny (through their duel) that must be confronted even at the cost of his other ambitions. \nThe Outlaw slowly comes around to help Claudia Cardinale's Jill character despite no real payoff for him. \nClaudia's character Jill has a dark background she's trying to get away from through her marriage and at the end she truly tries to move forward with the start of the station town she was left with. \n\nSeeing such profound character changes happening very subtly is the mark of a good director as the dialogue is sparse and often times it relies on the camera work to show this.\n\nI would highly recommend at least one viewing by anyone who's a fan of the Western genre just so you can make up your own mind about it.",

In my opinion the greatest Western of all time was probably \"The Outlaw Josey Whales\".   At least it's my Fav. I do believe that the western had a bit of a resurgence in the late 80's and Early 90's . With films like \" Dances with Wovles\" (don't hate on Costner it's a great movie. \"Lonesome Dove\" ( I know it's TV ). And then \" Unforgiven\" and of course the last great western made of that time frame \"Tombstone\". You can make the case for a few others . But not really. If there's anyone fighting to keep the western alive it would be Tarantino. QT was made some great work tWith \"Djano\" and \"The Hateful Eight\". Bringing Sergio Leone , Peckinpah type films \nto a whole new generation with a QT twist. \nThey're both fantastic modern westerns . Proving the western isn't dead. There's still hope. And when it's done right there's no better film. Once upon a time is a perfect example of it. And the score is amazing . You can truly get lost.",

Apart from the intricate and exciting plot, I found the details used to create a realistic Western atmosphere were other additions to the overall success of the movie. For example, the portrayal of men as greasy, sweaty people with reddish skin tones and women as white and perfect skinned gives an accurate portrayal of the time, when men were associated as breadwinners. These details added to the overall cinematography. Further, the director's use of close-ups to emphasize different scenes and truly show a character's reaction and feelings were highly effective in building suspense and creating tension. . The movie is a must-watch with its intrinsic storyline that plays with the minds of the audience until the very end and the director's attention to little detail to stay true to the times.",

Fonda had, of course, been in many westerns before the Leone flick. Being one of Hollywood's first darlings of the big screen doesn't make someone a good actor, and Fonda's constant grimacing, wincing, and other bizarre mannerisms that he seems to think is acting looks more as if he is suffering from a strange malediction. Let's face it, Fonda can't act for beans he's just some guy that Hollywood executives took a liking to in the '30's and decided to hype beyond all proportion. There were a lot of quirky actors from that period and it must have been felt by the higher ups that bizarre mannerisms would draw attention and at the same time project an image of ordinaryism. What they failed to realize is that both qualities are completely at odds with one another and the end result is something that becomes laughable.\nWell, that's enough about Fonda. Bronson isn't any better. He always looks out of place and in contrast to Fonda, his flattened affect is as flat as the desert landscape of the film.\nBesides poor casting and acting, the film is based on a  meaningless script and the worst action scenes of any Leone film.",

            "content": "\"Once Upon a Time in The West\" is the definition of a classic western,  directed by the incredibly talented and experienced Sergio Leone the movie revolves around two plots. Both of the conflicts in the movie take place around the fictional town called flagstone. The first plot consists of a battle of ownership for a piece of land near flagstone called Sweetwater, the reason this land is so precious is because it contains the only water source in the region and if the proposed railroad is built, it would have to stop through this piece of land. The land was bought by Brett McBain who saw this as an opportunity to capitalize on his wealth but as soon as railroad tycoon Morton hears about this he sends his Goon (Frank) to intimidate Brett off his land but instead Frank ends up killing Brett and his three children.  Meanwhile a harmonica playing stranger pursues Frank and kills men that Frank sent after him. \n   \n  This film really elevates Western's to Art with the brilliance of Sergio Leone's directing, most of the filming taking place in Spain, with support of the Spanish government which actually allowed the crew to move and change some sand area's to fit for the film.  A few scenes were filmed in the U.S. The Unique locations of the film really transformed it and made it great using stations like \"Estacion de Calahorra\" were the famous opening sequence was shot.  However, what made this film truly great was the acting, especially by Henry Fonda who played \"Frank\" (the hired gun) who was typically portrayed as this hero in hollywood westerns, always coming in and saving the day but in this particular scene his gang has just finished shooting an entire family and out comes this boy (about six-nine years old) running and seeing his whole family just laying in the floor dead and this classically western gang pulling up in horses, then one of the members says \"So Frank, what are we going to do with this one?\" and then he stops and says \"Well... Now that you said my name\" and in pure cold blood showing no emotions whatsoever in his eyes kills this boy.  This scene was brilliantly directed and was a great contradictory to the roles that Fonda typically sticks to and furthermore was a great move on Sergio Di Leone's part.  The other actors (Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson, and Jason Robards) all delivered great performances but the with this scene Fonda just changes the intensity of the movie completely and earns best actor throughout this film in my books. \n The music is also very particular in this film mainly because throughout most of it there is none,  in fact until the minute of \"judgement\" is played while Harmonica kills the three outlaws there is no soundtrack provided until the second scene and just natural sounds are played. \n    \n   I'm not particularly a fan of westerns, but this film just made me want to keep on watching it and never stop until it was over. Overall I would rate this film a 5/5 and would definitely watch this film again.",

Henry Fonda is the only actor in this Western that gives a remarkable performance. The film may be long, but no so slow, however, the character of Claudia Cardinale is very bad and lacks any form of characterization. Moreover, she behaves just like a whore till the very end of the film, oh I forgot, isn't that what she plays in the movie? Charles Bronson ineffectively plays another ' man with no name' kind of character without the genuinity that Eastwood would bring to that character.",

The plot is not immediately obvious which adds interest but there are so many factors that make this film memorable. The characterisations are strong, the wide screen shots of the desert are breath-taking and the music haunting. The film is shot in a way that highlights textures and the background sound is relatively loud, so rough-hewn planks creak and in the long, slow (and epic) scene at the station, a group of evil-looking gunfighters wait for a train, with a fly buzzing annoyingly round one of their faces, the only action as the tension builds, reminiscent of High Noon. The scene at the end is another one beautifully shot and includes the prettiest horse you've ever seen.\nThis powerful and artistic film will stay with you long after you've seen it, and you cannot see it just once.",

Commonly billed as a revenge tale, it is much more than that. Claudia Cardinale plays Jill, the widow of an Irish-American homesteader who struggles to save his land from her husband's killer, a sly and ruthless Henry Fonda (in a notable departure from his wholesome image). Charles Bronson and Jason Robards are superb as two likeable bandits who also find themselves squaring off with Fonda's villain. The characters, while archetypal, are all as rich and real as any ever conceived--Jill is no damsel in distress; Fonda's Frank is no mustache-twirling through-and-through baddie. And speaking of realism, Leone shot substantial portions of the film in the real American Southwest, whose ruddy pillars of rock and dusty desert vistas feel gloriously authentic, more so than even the picturesque Spanish plains where the Spaghetti Westerns were more commonly filmed. And it's all topped off by what is arguably Ennio Morricone's grandest score, with its lilting main theme and a number of other poignant compositions. It's not fair to compare it to \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" Both are utter masterpieces, and each stands on its own as a unique tribute to a mythical yet visceral time and place, beautifully brought to life by a wise, visually gifted outsider.",

The movie unfortunately to me was not all that amazing though. The characters weren't all that interesting, and the hero was a little bland. He isn't a cool and interesting hero like Clint Eastwood in his westerns. The pacing is also pretty lackluster, it needlessly drags out on many dull scenes. The script is pretty un-engaging, I never got into the dialogue scenes. It has zero rewatchability due to some uninspired writing and bland characters. But the technical aspects are very good, this is a well shot and made movie. Once Upon a Time in the West gets 3.5/5 stars (B).",

I was blown away by Sergio Leone's direction in The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, and that was the only film of his that I'd seen up to this point, but now I honestly can't say which of the two films I prefer. This is perhaps a better film because it is set on a grander and epic scale, but perhaps not as entertaining as the other. Both films have terrific performances with memorable characters and a masterful score composed by Ennio Morricone that accompanies Tonino Delli Colli's beautiful cinematography. Leone's exaggerated close ups show us the dirt and the sweat coming out of these grim people's faces and it's juxtaposed perfectly with these extremely long shots of the vastness of the Western valley. I can't imagine liking this film more than I already do, but it is clear that these films were made to experience them in the big screen and it's a pity I couldn't do so. There are also many memorable quotes in this film and I absolutely loved the screenplay. For the first 90 minutes or so I wasn't sure what direction the movie was heading and that is what I liked about this film since it had me guessing at some of the characters motivations and where the plot was trying to go. The characters have a lot depth and not even the villain is portrayed in a stereotypical way.  Along with Unforgiven these are the three best Westerns I've seen so you can bet I will watch more of Leone's spaghetti westerns in the future. \n\nThe film couldn't open in a more spectacular fashion as the camera follows three gunmen waiting for someone at a station. Once the train arrives, the men don't find who they are waiting for and as they are walking away they hear someone playing a harmonica. It is the mysterious man they've been expecting (Charles Bronson) who asks them where Frank is. They've been sent to kill him, but Harmonica is too quick for their guns and finishes them off claiming they \"have brought two horses too many.\" Then we are introduced to a recently married family man who is living on his deserted property with his three children and expecting his new wife to arrive that very day, but a group of bandits led by blue eyed Frank (Henry Fonda) kills them all one by one for reasons that aren't explained yet. The bride, Jill (Claudia Cardinale), arrives to find them all murdered and the officers find evidence that lead them to believe that the outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) is responsible. The lives of these three men all intersect with Jill's and as the story develops the plot and mystery unfolds.  \n\nSergio Leone had me engaged with the film from the very opening sequence and he sets the slow paced tone rather quickly. He takes his time to let the action unfold but thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the gripping score I was never bored for a minute. I was continually trying to guess what was going on and what the motivation of each character truly was. I was surprised that Leone decided to have Ford's character shoot a young kid in a very early scene in the movie, and I can only imagine what a shocker that must have been for audiences during that time who were used to seeing Ford play the hero. Bronson is mysterious but it is rather obvious from the beginning what his intentions are. He still delivers a gripping performance as this mysterious character and when his backstory is finally revealed it all pays off. It was Robards' character who had me guessing at times what his real intentions were. At first I believed he was going to be one of the main villains, but he delivers most of the funny scenes and was perhaps one of the best characters in the film. The breathtaking Claudia Cardinale may have not been given a strong female role, but she wasn't simply a damsel in distress and she seemed to know what she was doing. Once Upon a Time in the West is not a straightforward revenge story and it blends several tones throughout the film having you sympathize with each character at different points of the story. Leone maintained the thrilling atmosphere for its entire runtime and the final showdown is rewarding. This is an epic masterpiece and a new addition to my favorite movies of all time list that I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to experience.\n\nhttp://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",

The style alone felt too cool and dangerous for its time -- the dual scene play, the foggy flashbacks, the musical cues that the audience does not expect the characters to notice, complete silence in effective use, and, of course, Ennio Morricone's score, much more somber and leisurely in its movements, though frightening in the tensest moments.\n\nSergio Leone's presentation was perfect for this Wild West melodrama, starring four characters whose motives remain some degree of a mystery, well past any revelations we may have about their situations. This is in debt to both the actors -- Claudia Cardinale, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, and Henry Fonda (the villain!) -- and the script, which together tell a story of self-interested players and shooters who try to predict the target's next move as best as they can, without revealing their tactic. Frank (Fonda) seems to play strictly for profit, gaining such by whatever means are necessary. Jill (Cardinale), after moving into her home to find her entire family dead, wants to settle into the lifestyle she had planned in the first place. Cheyenne (Robards) usually plays for profit too, though he was framed by Frank for the death of Jill's family and must shift focus towards protecting her and himself. Harmonica (Bronson) is out for blood, Frank's blood. They are all smart people, and do not dare reveal every perspective and strategy in their book. However, they also immediately pounce on the opportunities for an alliance, however long it will last. I could not say there was much of a theme, as each character's motives were so different, but a theme does not matter as much as focus. And Leone has that, packaging Once Upon a Time in the West in such a way that demands your full attention for every scene, lest you miss an important clue into a character's head. Cinema at its chunkiest and most gripping.",

            "content": "Once Upon a Time in the West is a well made Western but I can not see it being everyone's ideal entertainment for the almost 3 hour running time. I believe the running time is what the issue is. For myself personally I felt the pacing of the film hard to follow and a bit of work on editing may help. Once the plot went in a direction that caught your attention it would not be long until it began to slow down again. This kept repeating itself throughout the film and did not seem to keep a steady (but exciting) pace. I ended up finding myself struggling to keep my attention fro the full 3 hours as well as finding myself confused over which character I should have been rooting for. The film started with a situation occuring which should have worked into a storyline of revenge, but you never really feel that this is what you end with. The ending expected happened but it was how that puzzled me. It could be that this is how Sergio Leone wanted it to go by giving it an unpredictable feel to normal life in the West, but for me it just felt disappointing. \nAway from this personal issue of mine though, I can not praise enough the work that has been put into this film. The script is well written with nice amounts of humour pocketed in there. The usual choice of the Spanish filming locations is a smart move. With the sets and costumes suitable for the era you really find yourself in the Wild West and not watching a film set. The music is also spot on with the fantastic haunting sound of the harmonic played whenever Charles Bronson enters the scene.\nOnce Upon a Time in the West includes an excellent cast and has been made to perfectly represent the West. The opening scene with detail to every single thing in the frame is a ideal example to what perfect filmmaking is. Whilst I did not appreciate the story fully this time, hopefully a second viewing would give me the chance to understand it more and reward it a full 5 stars.",

            "content": "From my blog, http://madmikeofmetal.blogspot.ca/2014/06/mad-reviews-once-upon-time-in-west.html\n\nIt is 1968, the master of the Spaghetti Western, Sergio Leone, is coming off the heels of the Dollars Trilogy, which is arguably the greatest trio of movies ever made. He now faced the challenge of having to make a landmark western movie without the likes of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, or Eli Wallach. For this new project, Leone recruited western mainstay Charles Bronson, legendary actor Henry Fonda, and rounded off the cast with bombshell Claudia Cardinale and the underrated Jason Robards. Not even M Night Shyamalan can fuck up with this kind of cast (actually he would, I shouldn't give him too much credit). The result is what is considered to be one of the greatest westerns ever made: Once Upon a Time in the West.\n\nThis is another film that was on my watch list for a long time. I loved the dollars trilogy and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of my favourite movies of all time. Considering that OUATITW is directed by same guy and scored by the same composer as those three epics, this is a movie that I was looking forward to watching more than any other 'classic' film.\n\nSo, was I blown away or disappointed? Well, after seeing it for the first time, I guess you can say I found it somewhat impressive... Oh who am I kidding THIS MOVIE IS FUCKING AWESOME!\n\n\nYeah, I absolutely adore this movie! In my opinion, this another fine piece of work by Leone and one of the best westerns I've ever seen! So what exactly did I love so much about it? Well...\n\n\nThe opening sequence is the greatest opening sequence I've ever seen. The first handful of shots are slow, eerie, and soaked with atmosphere. You have one guy locking an old man in a closet, one guy drinking water out of his hat, and another guy trying to kill a fly with the barrel of his own gun, all in the confines of a train station in the middle of nowhere. What I love most about this is that the movie manages to pull you in and grab your attention, even though you have no idea what is going on...\n\n\nAfter about 5 minutes of fly chasing and windmill screeching, a train finally shows up at the station. These 3 aforementioned cowboys stand next to the train in a dual-like stance, anxiously awaiting something (or someone). The train then departs the station and they start to walk away... Until they hear the harmonica, and see Charles motherfucking Bronson on the other side of the station as the train leaves. He's standing there playing a harmonica and being all badass about it, and then after a little bantering about a possible fourth horse, he says to them \"you brought 2 too many\" and then proceeds to open fire on all three. He kills all three of them, but the last one manages to get a shot off and hit Harmonica (Bronson) in the shoulder.\n\nAmazing suspense, amazing atmosphere, and one fuck of a payoff! Seriously... Best. Opening Scene. Ever!\n\n\nThe second scene is set up nearly the same way. The movie introduces you to the McBain family (no Simpsons jokes, please), who are anxiously awaiting the arrival of their mother/wife. After Mr. McBain goes to the well for some water, we hear a gunshot and see his daughter fall to the ground. We then hear another gunshot and see his oldest son fall to his death as well. McBain then gets shot multiple times himself and killed. As the youngest member of the McBain family walks out of the house, we see a large group of bandits, led by Frank (played by Henry fucking Fonda)... who after thinking for about 30 seconds, decides to pull his revolver out and shoot the kid. \n\n\nThat my friends, is how you introduce a villain! You make him kill off an entire family, and see his smile as he shoots a child. That has one of the darkest scenes I've ever watched.\n\nSo that's two things about the movie that I love right off the bat: The opening sequence, and the character introductions. Amazing!\n\n\nThe story is absolutely fantastic too, I won't give too much away but I just love how the movie keeps you guessing. You don't know what Harmonica's beef with Frank is until the movie's climax, where you also find out why Harmonica plays the Harmonica! It's a classic tale of revenge, heartbreak, betrayal, and old west debauchery all rolled into one. I liked how the movie was able to stay in suspense for 2 hours and 45 minutes without cinematically blue-balling its audience. The story is relatable, awesome, and incredibly inspiring... What more can you ask for?\n\n\nThe acting in this movie is outstanding. Charles Bronson, who was already a household name at this time, put on arguably the best performance of his career as Harmonica. Henry Fonda seemed to have been born to play Frank in this movie, and it added to his already legendary resume. Jason Robards is stellar as Cheyenne and Claudia Cardinale put on one of the strongest female performances ever in a western as Jill McBain. The characters themselves are memorable. Harmonica has a Man with No Name vibe to him as he is calm, cool, and badass throughout the movie, and he's badass without even trying to be. Frank is the perfect yin to Harmonica's yang, he's cold, cunning, and ruthless. Frank is one of the greatest movie villains of all time, in my opinion. I mean... HE MURDERS A KID AND SMILES FOR FUCK SAKES!!! That's one dude you don't want to fuck with!\n\nAs with every other Leone film ever made, the cinematography is absolutely fantastic! The close ups are bone chilling as usual, especially during the final showdown between Harmonica and Frank. The shot of the three bandits standing in a badass stance as Harmonica just plays away in the background is just beautiful. You see Leone get very creative with his camera as this movie is one of the best shot that I've ever seen. I won't give away much more in terms of cinematography, but if you're a Sergio Leone fan, you'll know what you're in for...\n\nThe music is... Oh my fucking lord the music!!! It's just... Gosh it's just fucking bone chilling! Ennio Morricone did an absolutely fantastic job in scoring this film. The Harmonica theme is symphonic ally beautiful yet badass all at the same time! The main theme, while not as memorable as TGTBATU's theme, is terrific! Morricone is one of my favourite movie composers of all time and this movie is one of the reasons why! *eargasm*\n\n\nNow I know I've said the word \"badass\" in this review quite frequently. That's because this movie is just the personification of badass! It's badass on top of badass with badass to drink and badass on the side, with some more badass for dessert! Badass characters, badass directing, badass story, badass acting, yeah you get it, just badass! But it's the best kind of badass as well: It's the kind of badass that doesn't even try to be badass. The movie isn't waving its fists at you and saying \"I'm a badass motherfucker\", it's just a badass motherfucker without having to tell you. You just know it by watching it.\n\n\nCan you tell I'm in love with this movie yet? Yeah, it's nice to know that at there's one 1968 classic that's deserving of all its praise (I'm looking at you, 2001!). This is hands down one of my favourite movies ever! If I did a top 20 list, Once Upon A Time in the West will definitely make an appearance on there somewhere! This movie is fucking amazing!\n\nThe only bad thing I can really say about this movie, is that it's not as much of a masterpiece as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but comparing to that movie just wouldn't be fair. I guess if I can say anything remotely negative about this movie, it's this: If you're a casual movie watcher, then Once Upon a Time in the West is not the movie for you, it's a movie for people who truly love the art of filmmaking. That's really the only bad thing I can say, and even then it's not really a bad thing!\n\nI'll just conclude that this yet another milestone in Sergio Leone's legendary career!",

However, it suffers from the same problems as all of Leone's westerns: overly long, often-ridiculous dialogue and an abundance of hammy acting.\n\nStarts off well enough.  Good build-up with much intrigue.  However, if you think only the intro is going to be slow, to build up the suspense, and are hoping the remainder of the movie will movie will move at a quicker pace, you're in for a rude surprise.  The whole movie moves at that pace.\n\nHas some good action sequences.  Despite the unnecessary, and seeminly random, complexity of the plot, it comes together well at the end.\n\nAs mentioned, dialogue and acting often leave much to be desired.  Henry Fonda is great in his role.  Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale are solid in their roles and even Charles Bronson is more-or-less okay (it is touch-and-go though!).  \n\nHowever, as usual in Leone movies, it's the supporting cast who are largely atrocious.  Some of the worst acting you'll ever see.  Prize for worst performance here goes to the villain who gets thrown off the train and shot by Henry Fonda.  I hope he went back to his day job.",

The bandits, cowboys, and killers on display in Once Upon a Time in the West look like their roles, not dandied up fools playing at it.\n\nThe story in which these stolid men do battle is told with restraint, with patience.  That, I think, is Sergio Leone's greatest mastery, his willingness to let the pot stew, to let it heat up, until it is boiling angrily and only then to let it explode, in one instant, in the famous Old Western quick draw.  Yet it's more than mere gunplay and vengeance; Once Upon a Time in the West is Leone's goodbye to the Old West.  The railroad is present even the first scene and plays a pivotal role throughout.  With it comes the birth of the New West and the death of the Old West.  There's a sadness there, a melancholic inevitability that lingers in every frame.\n\nI suppose I haven't said much about the actual plot of this film.  Well, it's a tale of the dying West.  There's a railroad baron, a bandit named Cheyenne, a nameless drifter with a harmonica, a beautiful woman, and a killer named Frank.  The greedy, the ugly, the good, the beautiful, and the bad, if you will.  What do you think is going to happen?\n\nFinal Say: Pure mastery.  Absolute must watch.  Sergio Leone is probably my very favorite director.\n\nHow to Watch It: This should really go without saying, but with your phone turned off, your children put to bed, your dog already walked, your tasks all done.  Once Upon a Time is a film which pulls you in.  If you don't let it... *shrug*\n\nTrivia: This film originally tanked at the box office: $5.3 million when it cost a budget of $5 million.  *shakes head* People are idiots.",

In layman's terms, you just can't make it happen.\n\nI found myself in this predicament at about the 1.5 hour mark of Sergio Leone's 1968 film Once Upon a Time in the West.  I kept trying to change how I felt, but my heart wouldn't listen to me.\n\n-\n\nSergio Leone is a god of film.  If the gods of film were Greek, he might just be considered Zeus.  If he were a Greek god, there's a chance Sergio Leone would be hanging out on the top of Mount Olympus, eating grapes with Athena, while his scornful brother Orson Welles pounded the seashore with powerful waves as he thundered about in his castle far beneath the sea.  I'm not saying this would be the case...I'm just speculating.\n\nEither way, I am one of the many that worship His Highness.  If I could, I would make a pilgrimage far away and pay my respects.\n\nLeone, of course, made his career changing the face of the Western genre forever.  His Man With No Name Trilogy, directed on his home turf, Italy, introduced most of the world to a young Clint Eastwood and the so-called Spaghetti Western.  The old-school Hollywood conventions of the Western were thrown out the window: cowboys and Indians; blonde damsels in distress; cheery, clean shaven heroes with good intentions and morals.  All gone, out with the trash.  Leone's vision of the West was inspired by the American West, and portrayed the American West, but it was inherently non-American.  It was a vision that was more vivid, more real, more beautiful, more powerful, and more sinister than anything Hollywood could ever produce at the time.\n\nThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, the final leg of the The Man With No Name Trilogy, is considered by many to be the greatest film of all-time.  I am one of the many.\n\n-\n\nAnd so I was excited when I recently sat down in front of my computer to watch Once Upon a Time in the West on Netflix.  Once Upon a Time in the West was the first film that Leone directed following The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  Leone was looking to get out of the Western genre at the time; he had three Westerns and two Ancient Mediterranean films under his belt as a director, and he was excited to start work on a New York crime film, which would eventually become Once Upon a Time in America, his last film. But the man had become HOT HOT HOT as a Western film director, and the movie studios that held the power wanted him to stay in that genre.  United Artists, the studio that produced The Man With No Name Trilogy, approached him with an offer to make a Western with Charlton Heston, Kirk Douglas and Rock Hudson; he turned them down.\n\nHe wouldn't be able to resist the next offer: Paramount not only gave him a juicier budget to work with, but they also promised him access to Henry Fonda on the film.  Fonda had long been Leone's favorite actor, and Leone had always openly expressed his wish to work with him.  With Fonda effectively being used as bait, the trophy fish had been caught: the Master of the Western, Sergio Leone, was signing on to make another Western.  The New York crime film would have to wait.  (Interestingly enough, Leone worked as a director of Western films for the next seven years; he wouldn't start work on his New York crime film, Once Upon a Time in America, until 1982).\n\nTo come up with the story, Leone called two film critic friends, Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento, to help him out.  Bertolucci and Argento would each become legendary directors in their own right: Bertolucci for political, religious and/or romantic dramas such as Last Tango in Paris, The Sheltering Sky, and The Last Emperor; Argento for Italian horror masterpieces such as Opera, Deep Red, and Supsiria.  Together, the three of them sat around in Leone's house hanging out and watching old American Westerns.  They watched High Noon, The Comancheros, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Iron Horse, 3:10 to Yuma.  They watched The Magnificent Seven, The Searchers, Vera Cruz, and Shane.  They watched a lot of movies with John Wayne.  And at some point, the three of them sat around a table and began putting a story together.\n\n-\n\nBy all means, one would imagine that the outcome would be brilliant.  Once a general story was put together, Leone sat down and wrote the screenplay.  Once the screenplay was written, Leone called in Sergio Donati, a renowned screenwriter, to refine it and keep it from dragging too long.\n\nThe story centered on four central figures:  Frank (Henry Fonda), a ruthless villain; Cheyenne (Jason Robards), the leader of a gang of bandits ; Harmonica (Charles Bronson), a mysterious, harmonica playing gunslinger; and Jill McBain (Claudia Cardinale), a former prostitute from New Orleans whose entire family had been murdered.\n\nThings start when Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) is murdered along with his entire family.  They are murdered by Frank and his gang, who are able to frame the crime on Cheyenne.  The crime took place for purely financial reasons:  McBain had a keen eye for a future profit, and watched as a new railroad line was being built across the desert.  He bought the only chunk of land in the new railroad's path that had fresh water, and planned to build a business that would cater to the thousands of passengers that would pass through his land looking for refreshments.  Frank murdered everyone in the family in order to buy the land himself, but something happened that he didn't expect: Jill McBain, the wife of Brett McBain, arrived from New Orleans the next day to find her family murdered and the valuable land entirely in her possession.\n\nFrom this point a psychological game of sorts develops between the four main characters. Cheyenne knows he's been framed by Frank and goes on the run, vowing to get to the bottom of things without getting caught and hanged, but not before meeting Harmonica and forming an alliance of sorts.  Harmonica, whom we know nothing about, watches everything unfold as he sits in the shadows and plays his namesake instrument in a haunting fashion: he seems to be there to help, but we don't know for sure.  He's a classic Leone character, a fascinating mystery who is a pleasure to watch, a dangerous man who instills a longing inside us to be dangerous and cool.  Jill McBain settles down into her house in the desert, knowing full well that there are men nearby by who have the means and reasons to kill her.  She is paid visits by Cheyenne, Harmonica and Frank at different times: the tension in their scenes is always slightly ominous, slightly sexual.\n\nLeone's films have a tendency to work around tenuous alliances.  Tuco, Angel Eyes and Blondie all worked together at some point in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, despite the fact that they were ultimately all against each other; Manco and Colonel Mortimer teamed up in For a Few Dollars More, despite being rivals; in A Fistful of Dollars, flimsy alliances destroyed the powerful families that run the terrible town that Clint Eastwood stumbles upon during his travels; and Juan and Sean worked together in the name of the Mexican Revolution in Duck, You Sucker!, but only because trickery, outright lies, and the threat of dynamite were used as coercion.  Once Upon a Time in the West is no different: it doesn't take long for Cheyenne, Harmonica, Frank and Jill to all become acquainted with each other, form alliances, and ultimately deceive one another.\n\nBut these characters, ambiguous as they may be, are more in the mold of old American Western characters than previous Leone film characters.  In most Leone films there aren't a lot of cut and dry bad guys or good guys (aside from the minor characters, who are usually equally dumb and \"bad\").  Clint Eastwood battles \"bad guys,\" but he himself is something of a degenerate \"bad guy\"; he certainly can't be described as a hero.  Perhaps the most striking example is Tuco from The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly: he's nothing more than a cheat and a thief, someone who robs and murders people as a living.  And yet when he meets his brother, who is a monk, it's impossible not to feel his amazing humanness come through the screen.  Can someone that genuine be a \"bad guy?\"  (Of course, there are exceptions to every rule....Angel Eyes [The Good, the Bad, and they Ugly] and Ramon Rojo [A Fistful of Dollars] are pretty standard bad guys).\n\nBut in Once Upon a Time in the West, we see Leone's characters interacting through a much more traditional lens: i.e., more cut and dry bad guys.  Frank was bad; Cheyenne was good; Harmonica was good; Jill was good.  This all becomes clear at the end, when Cheyenne and Harmonica prepare to ride off into the sunset as close friends.  But Leone couldn't help who he was; or, more precisely, who his characters were.  Despite the fact that we are supposed to see these people as villains and heroes at the end, the same ambiguities as before are present.   They are shady, mysterious, and sly; they are not heroic.  They don't belong in the American Western; they would be much more at home a true Leone Western, a place where The Man With No Name exists and yet doesn't exist.\n\n--\n\nLeone Westerns typically dwell in a universe that isn't exactly the same as the one we live in; there's always some mysticism involved.  The Man With No Name Trilogy is a perfect example: Eastwood plays the same character in each film, and yet he doesn't.  He has a different nickname in each film, and he knows different people in each film, and he seems to be an entirely different person in each film.  And yet he's not.  He's the Man With No Name in each film, despite his nicknames.  Are Manco and Blondie the same character existing in different stories in different places at different times in their respective lives?  Maybe, but it's beyond the point, because these movies are not supposed to be real, despite their often very human moments.  They're dreams.  Dreams about the Wild West and what it once was.  The real Wild West was without a question a dirty, terrible, often boring place: but Leone's Wild West doesn't deal with reality.  It deals with our dreams.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in the West, however, leaves the dream world of the West behind and embraces a more solid form of reality.  It re-visits all of the old American Westerns that Leone and his friends watched in his home months earlier, movies that starred John Wayne and aren't usually described as \"dreamlike.\"  The damsel in distress, as beautiful and fair-haired as ever, makes her return in the form of Jill.  The cold-hearted, one-dimensional villain makes his return in the form of Frank.  There is a scene of men happily building a railroad while Jill brings them water with a big smile on her face and happy music plays in the background.  Despite being an Italian Spaghetti Western, this film manages to feel American.  A few scenes were even filmed in Monument Valley, Utah.\n\nIt also takes a look at the racial inequalities that were prominent in the American West.  We see Chinese women cleaning clothing in a dark room while a white man looks on as supervisor.  We see Jill walking ahead with an heir of superiority as two black men carry her bags for her at the train station.  Leone was not one to shy away from social issues: war and family are themes that he often touched upon.  But there's something mundane and real about seeing two black men who we assume to be slaves carrying bags for a white woman; it's less dramatic than the scene in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly in which a Union army officer waxes poetic about the dregs of war as thousands of men are killed while fighting for a bridge.  But it's also more real, more grounded and less dream-like.\n\nAnd yet despite all this, Once Upon a Time in the West is still without question a Leone film: it's like listening to the guitar of Jimi Hendrix or Jerry Garcia.  All you need to hear are a few chords to know who the artist in question is.  The result is a sort of hybrid: a film that embraces long shots of silence, haunting music, and mysterious characters while making an effort to stay realistic and straightforward.\n\n-\n\nRotten Tomatoes loves Once Upon a Time in the West.  98% Approval Rating.  I visited the website after finishing the film to see what everyone thought.\n\nAt the time of it's release it did well in Europe, but panned in America.  It didn't matter that 20 minutes were cut out of the American version; Americans were bored.\n\nMaybe I'm just another dumb American with a short attention span, but I'd like to defend myself.  I don't think this film is as good as it lets on.  Leone's films are always slow, but usually in a beautiful way, like how Philip Glass's music is slow.  His long takes build up a sense of wonderment at what we're watching, and the beautiful shots we see in Once Upon a Time in the West are no different.  But the plot is too somber and real to keep us in that happy place we want to be in: we meet exciting characters, but there's no fantastic voyage for them to embark on.  There's no buried treasure.  There's no mystical experiences.  There's a railroad, an auction, and some shootouts, but it's ultimately unfulfilling.  It's like being half-awake and dreaming while hearing your annoying neighbor talking too loudly next door: there's just too much reality to embrace the dream.\n\nI was torn on a final grade for this film.  On one aspect, it was often boring to watch, and I never felt a connection with the characters.  On the other hand, it was still a beautiful film directed by Sergio Leone that had me entranced at times.\n\nFinal Grade: B+/A-",

            "content": "Even if you don't like Westerns, you should watch this movie (you can kill me later if you don't like it). After watching a lot of blah movies this summer, I have finally realized what was missing after watching this movie. Story depth. This movie has more depth in the first 15 minutes than the majority of films that came out this summer. Sergio Leone crafted something amazing with this movie, from the camera work to the set pieces to the action and intensity. One thing that might annoy people is Sergio Leone worked on a form of silent communication between characters which I think works very, very well. This technique does involve quite a bit of eye action but the focus and the acting really stand out with what was being attempted. There is more Shakespeare in the non-speaking between characters in this movie than all of the last movie I saw (Mortal Instruments: City of Bones).\n\nLet's talk about part of what makes this movie so special and why it has so much depth but first cinema history! Before this movie and others at the time, Westerns were more glamorized as forces between good and evil. Even if your hero was an outlaw, he was still a \"good\" guy. (On a side note something I find interesting is Westerns and Fantasy are actually very similar). It was often the good guy wore white or was in some way represented by white (white hat) and the bad guy would be all black or black hat (see, Fantasy again). In some ways, Cowboys were like the first superheroes a young generation identified with and then came the spaghetti westerns. Suddenly there were gray areas between black and white. The good guys were no longer paragons of virtue and the bad guys weren't so easily defined. It was a different type of Western and one that brought more thought into actual storytelling. This and Fistful of Dollars are to westerns like Watchmen is to comics.\n\nGreat so now that I have a little hyperbole out of the way let me go on into this movie specifically (and more hyperbole). When there is talk about shades of gray I think people misinterpret what is being said. Gray is after all a boring color and hard to get variety if everything is shades of gray (there must be more than 50 right?) What it is really talking about in my opinion is character motivation. We hear all the time about how characters should be 3D and not cardboard cutouts but have we thought about what that really means? Obviously it means characters should have a past but it's not just a past. It is series of life choices that lead them to that moment we are first introduced to them. There is still more though than that, it is how the consequences of past actions determines future choices and a character's primal motivation. The very thing that makes them tick and this movie demonstrates it on every character at every level. The characters drive the story and it suddenly stops becoming a simple fairy tale but something more real and emotional. Before people were just painting in black and white with stories but now there is something new added and it isn't gray, it is color. There is so much more range in what is being told.\n\nOkay so you can tell I thought the characters were amazing but the story they tell in this movie is equally amazing. Right, so back to the beginning. The movie starts out with a mystery in what is happening and starts to deliver several different threads, slowly it all starts to weave together and come to a very satisfying conclusion. The story pacing is really something else and you can tell a lot of effort went into crafting this story. Charles Bronson delivers an outstanding performance a delivers some of the best one liners in any movie (sorry Arnold but Bronson really beat you on this one). Then you have the introduction of Frank played by Henry Fonda. This was quite a different role than what I am used to seeing Henry Fonda play and wow did he do an amazing job. This role is somewhat like Heath Ledger's Joker except I found Frank a bit more chilling. (Seriously, Frank and the Joker would be a scary combo). Then you have Cheyenne who ended up being my favorite character.... Well tied for favorite (okay so I am susceptible to eye candy, leave me alone). Jason Robards was simply put amazing, clever and really brought a different type of charisma to the movie. He is one of those there is method to his madness characters and always says something surprising. Then we have the lone female in the movie played by Claudia Cardinale. Who? Yeah I hadn't heard of her either but her character was very interesting (and guys... she is very pretty) because she wasn't quite the damsel in distress. She used what she knew and worked with people in ways that stayed true to her character in trying to accomplish what she wanted.\n\nI hate to leave this for last and I almost forgot to mention this but the music in this movie is amazing. Ennio Morricone did an amazing job that is almost unparalleled in modern movies. It adds so much to the atmosphere and mood of what is being presented on screen but at the same time Sergio Leone also knew when to use silence very effectively. The movie uses sounds in such an incredible way. It really makes the movie over the top on my recommendation list.\n\nIn my opinion if you're even remotely interested in storytelling you should watch this movie. If you like westerns then chances are you have seen this movie already and are saying to yourself, \"Wow, GE is slow on the uptake here.\" If you haven't seen it though, make time to see it. If you like adventure movies and action movies see this movie. If you recall I trashed The Lone Ranger and then watching this movie I thought it was so funny that they both share quite a few similarities but this movie is how to do it right. If you don't like older movies you should suck it up and watch this anyway. (At the end of the day if you don't like this movie, feel free to hurt me.)\n\nThis is on the Green Embers' Recommended List!",

Once Upon a Time in the West is the ultimate tribute to the western genre, in fact it could even be called the ultimate fan film with its numerous elements and situations that were directly lifted from previous works of the kind and were put together in storyline form by the collaborative effort between Leone and two other major Italian filmmakers, Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento. In many ways, it could be called the beginning of cinematic post-modernism. The photography is monumental, with its long camera movements and a pace which was dictated by Morricone's outstanding and unforgettable score, itself carrying a sort of peter and the wolf experimentation where each main character in the film is defined by a unique theme; the importance of music gives the film an operatic film that is distinctively unique.

Ennio Morricone's score works chillingly well with Sergio Leone's images.  Charles Bronson, while no Clint Eastwood, does an excellent job here, and Henry Fonda is excellent as the villain.  The film concludes on a bittersweet note, which I think really works to this film's advantage.  No one is a clear \"good guy\" or \"bad guy.\"  This makes the characters that much harder to completely figure out and thus more realistic.  While I do enjoy \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,\" and while the characters are somewhat complex, the line between good and evil still feels like it's very well defined: Eastwood is the hero, and Van Cleef is the villain.  I enjoy the complexity that \"West\" offers by blurring this line, but I also understand that this may not be a film that everyone will enjoy.  It is definitely worth a watch.",

You'll love and hate them.The movie isn't dialogue heavy and consists of deep, intense stares which in my opinion is better than words and only adds to the drama and theme of the movie just anticipating for when the violence finally starts on screen.All I can say is that Once Upon a Time in the West is a perfect movie. It will definately teach you ways how to shoot a film if you aspire to become a filmmaker. It's entertaining, thrilling, and just plain badass.Check it out!",

            "content": "Sergio Leone was already the master of westerns with the Dollars trilogy, but with Once Upon a Time in the West, he combined his talents and created a western with depth that has yet to be matched. This is a masterpiece of atmosphere, performances, and slow building tension. The opening scene alone is fifteen minutes long, has barely no dialogue at all, and leads up to a very short shootout. The film is nearly three hours, and there are many scenes where not much happens. However, if you have the patience to appreciate the deliberate pacing, you are rewarded with a brilliant, beautifully crafted western with tons of depth and unforgettable performances and scenes. Obviously, this is a film that requires the ability to cope with long, possibly drawn out scenes that showcase amazingly executed direction.\n\n The first fifteen minutes may be the best opening scene of all time, and the finale is comparable in terms of quality to The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. The Dollars trilogy is more of a fun, entertaining exercise in the western genre, while Once Upon a Time in the West is an exercise of brilliance on epic scope through its memorable, haunting Ennio Morricone score that adds a sense of mystery and grit, as well as through its overall look and feel.\n\n I get chills every time I watch this movie, and you can definitely tell Sergio Leone took his time to tell a seemingly simple revenge story, and you can tell he did not rush at all. There's also a fantastic plot about a railroad construction that's equally as engaging as the revenge one, and it brings light to the end of the American west and the beginning of a new civilization. Its tone is dark, gloomy, and immersive. Theres a plethora of memorable quotes in this movie, such as \"You brought two too many.\" and \"Do you know anything about a guy going around playing the harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking, he plays. And when he better play, he talks.\" The acting is great from everyone, and the characters portray dark, haunting, mysterious characters. Henry Fonda as Frank may be one of the most memorable villains ever, and Jason Robards as Cheyenne is a likable, clever gunslinger. Claudia Cardinale as Jill really portrays her emotions well. \n\nHowever, the shining performance in this movie is Charles Bronson as Harmonica, who plays an inscrutable, haunting character, and Charles Bronson was perfect for the role. The cinematography is beautiful, showcasing epic, huge shots of a barren, somber western setting. You can really see Sergio Leone's maturity as a filmmaker improving every film (that's not to say the Dollars trilogy isn't a masterpiece as well). Once Upon a Time in the West is less entertaining than the Dollars trilogy, which I have soft spot for, but this is definitely a rewarding, brilliant film that is definitely one of my favorite films ever.",

            "content": "One thing I love about Sergio Leone's style as a director is his execution of telling a story in that while there are moments that have a purpose in progressing in the story, we can appreciate the moments where not much is happening, allowing more room for reflecting, whether it is beauty of the atmosphere in the world these characters live in or how the music is given a chance to evoke the emotions and be its own character. To sum up with more clarity, Sergio Leone made me learn to appreciate films that chooses to take its time, where all the little subtleties are the ones that add the most richness to a film's quality. It made me realize that there doesn't have to be things happening every minute in a movie to truly enjoy it.\n\nIf I were to describe this stylistic aspect of Leone's directing, I would say he is able to inject a feeling of richness in his stories that makes his films feel very warm in tone, all the while being stories with a lot of grit and sharp edges. With 'Once Upon a Time in the West,' this was the first time this specific quality became evident to me in movies. From all the vast landscapes filmed for specific scenes, we feel more like we are delving into a world of beauty that is rarely visited, than watching a mere movie. How Sergio Leone is able to make his films feel larger than life is an astounding achievement and inspiration for those with an artistic vision.\n\nAnd every acting performance is delivered with a sense of sophistication and grace in adding to this rich story. And with every performance, we are presented with characters that are memorable and pivotal to the world they exist in. The world that exists in the film is filled with dirt and grit, and how these characters behave are evident of the world they live in.\n\nAnd this world that we see is the death of the west and the ushering in of a new era. These characters all play a pivotal point in that, but what plays out in the end is a revelation that brings out the full picture of what lurks underneath the motives that fuels each event that occurs, to bring everything full circle. And the way the movie ends on this note is moving.\n\n'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a dark western filled with a lot of melancholy, but still possessing a quality of rich beauty. Underneath all the scenes of violence, there is an emotionally undercurrent that manages to seep through and how Sergio Leone is able to convey those emotions with so much subtlety shows the true mark of a great director. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' is a classic not only due to its ambition, but also in how grand it feels in every sense of the word.",
