    "summary": "Convinced of his irresistible appeal to women, Texas dishwasher Joe Buck (Jon Voight) quits his job and heads for New York City, thinking he'll latch on to some rich dowager. New York, however, is not as hospitable as he imagined, and Joe soon finds himself living in an abandoned building with a Dickensian layabout named Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). The two form a rough alliance, and together they kick-start Joe's hustling career just as Ratso's health begins to deteriorate.",

            "content": "This is a classic, both Voight and Hoffmann act beautifully and it is a picture with both deep emotion and social messages. Tackling the age-old questions of youth and talent, pitched somewhere between the experimental years and the coming of age it is a wonderful if not painful view into late adolescent dreams. Hoffmann plays the down and out, Voight the cowboy and the story is based around the life they have together whilst trying to make ends meet. It is a sad, witty and often beautiful piece of late 60s cinema.",

The Powers That Be in Hollywood wanted Middle America to know they'd shield their impressionable kiddies from real world topics such as hustling and gay sex.  It's gripping and disturbing; most of us don't want to live in the gutter this story portrays but it is part of the human experience.  BTW, NYC got even worse in the years following this movie until Rudy G cleaned things up a bit - at least based on surface appearances; see Al Pacino in \"Panic in Needle Park\" which came out a year or two later.  Hoffman's Ratzo Rizzo wasn't exactly warm and cuddly, but the ending will still affect you; that's how good the script, performances, and direction are.  Speaking of scripts, the line \"I'm Walkin' Here!\" was a complete ad-lib when Hoffman stayed in character while a cab drove around a film crew's roadblock.  That's acting chops for you.",

The Ratso Rizzo character made no sense and his endless coughing made the film even worse. I enjoy 70's New York and the film succeeded in being artsy but just in the basic sense of a film having a story to follow it failed miserably.

On top of great performances from Voight and Hoffman and some fantastic dialogue, the film is buoyed by some great images, including icicles dangling from their faucet and long shots of Joe Buck wandering aimlessly on the streets of Manhattan, overwhelmed by a sea of New Yorkers.  Unfortunately, the film hasn't aged particularly well as it is filled with outdated fast zooms and jerky flashbacks, as well as scenes that just don't fit in, like Rizzo's daydream of life in Miami.  Overall, it's a great movie despite the dated stylistic issues.",

            "content": "Dreaming of a more glamorous existence, an idealistic Texas greenhorn (Jon Voight) walks out on his mundane dishwasher's life and hops a bus bound for New York City, certain he'll find instant success as a high-priced gigolo. The city, as always, has different lessons in store. Soon, our cowboy's strapped for cash and out on the street, too soft for the harsh realities of his dream job but too proud to accept anything less. In desperation, he hooks up with a similarly out-of-luck grifter (Dustin Hoffman) and the two develop a chemical bond that sees them through some dangerously lean times, while the busiest metropolis on the planet buzzes and bustles, blissfully oblivious, on the other side of the wall.\n\nNotorious as the first X-rated film to see wide release, Midnight Cowboy earned its reputation with a risqu\u00e9 subject matter, explicit nudity, glamorized drug use and frank depictions of homosexuality (with a whole boatload of associated slurs). A lot of it still seems daring and edgy today, so I can only imagine how it looked to the viewers of 1969. Then again, there's a chance the setting itself adds a thing or two to the modern shock value. This is a real time capsule of a picture, a breathing document of a city that no longer exists, with an emphasis on subcultures and undercurrents that were pushed out of all the glossy framed photos. It's sixties New York, all right, but this particular close-up is more interested in the warts on its subject's nose and the dirt under its fingernails than the carefully-primped clothes and hairstyle it wears to mask the unsightly bits. \n\nThe unflattering depiction is fascinating, particularly to someone like me, who didn't live through that era, but the story often plods and telegraphs its intentions, with an unconventional series of flashbacks only further complicating matters. Hoffman and Voight are dynamite together, an unlikely duo whose connection resonates through the smoggy haze, and serve as major boons to a film that could have floundered otherwise.",

Hoffman is instantly likeable and steals every scene he's in, especially the taxi-dance with the male escort whose pocket he picks before striking a match on the departing cab. Schlesinger captures the dichotomous moods and tropes perfectly: both the optimism of Joe Buck's initial journey and the slow demise of his ambition; NYC's high society and its seedy underbelly; Rizzo's objectionable, casual homophobia and his compassion for Joe; the story weaves effortlessly between them all. And yet, for all that, this movie is thirty to forty minutes too long. The party of the ageing mods is drawn out; the flashbacks to Joe's past seem half-arsed and have, it seems, little bearing on his character. I enjoyed the movie but was ready for it to be over before it was.",

Joe Buck (Jon Voight) is a cowboy who travels to The Big Apple and makes a living as a male gigolo, hoping to score with wealthy city women. On his unsuccessful journey, he encounters a companion, a street shark Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) who has Picaresque visions of visiting Miami and a crippled leg. The rest of the movie is mostly Joe trying to fit in New York, him and Rizzo bickering about their personal lives, and Joe hooking up with mostly women. Also, the film intercuts with flashbacks and dreams of Joe and his tragic relationship with Annie, his childhood with his  grandmother, and his mental breakdown at a bar. The way these flashbacks are edited creates a rapid, psychedelic Eisensteinian energy, especially when it establishes Joe's dishwashing job in Texas. In fact, at first, I thought the whole film was one of those experimental art films that incorporated a coherent narrative. The scene where Rizzo and Joe visit an Andy Warhol party is one of my favorite scenes in the film. This scene accurately and prominently compliments the experimental editing and cinematography as a whole, showing medium shots of candid interviews with party guests, including Taylor Mead and Paul Morrissey. As a whole, Midnight Cowboy may need multiple viewings, but once you give it a second chance you will appreciate the movie more.\n\n(4 Bob Balaban Blowjobs out of 5)",

While Midnight Cowboy teases a film full of Jon Voight \u2014 whom I never realized had been that good-looking \u2014 jouncing about the Big Apple, sweeping lonely 40 and 50 somethings off their feet and into their penthouse suites, raking in the doe throughout, it quickly disturbs that sentiment into something much, much darker. While it is the only X-Rated film to ever win Best Picture (it began R-rated and switched back after only 2 years), the real obscenity here is the urban porn of city blight. I mean seriously, was New York the most disgusting place in the world pre-1990? The director, John Schlesinger, shot the film in a remarkable style, filled with intense cuts and colors, overlapping sound, and many times surreal \u2014 and the Academy agreed, as Schlesinger won Best Director for his efforts. Let's get to the two co-stars (both of whom were nominated for Best Actor, truly making them co-stars): Jon Voight as Texas \"Cowboy,\" Joe Buck, and Dustin Hoffman as Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo, were possibly the original gruesome twosome. Joe Buck aims to fuck his way through Manhattan and Ratso is going to make that happen. Well, turns out each of our protags thinks a little higher of themselves than what their talents will permit, and eventually become Odd Couple-like roommates in a condemned building. And I cannot stress enough how disgusting this place is. Their abode makes the dwellings in Requiem for a Dream look like suites in the Carlyle. My one criticism of the film is how really disgusting Ratso turns in the blink of an eye. When they meet, sure, he's sleazy but pretty normal. Then, after only a few days, maybe a week or so, off-screen, Joe finds him in a greasy spoon absolutely repulsive. Anyway, we get the classic shot of an out-of-towner sticking out of the sea of busy New Yorkers (it's been parodied to death, but this was 1969), a fantastic themed score and soundtrack \u2014 especially enjoyed the harmonica at the end \u2014 and just a basic plot that lets the acting and filmmaking take over. Of course, we want to see this duo take their \"talents\" to South Beach, but we know we're not gonna get it.",

            "content": "A very stylized movie, with a constant stream of flashbacks and imagery as we follow a young man trying to make his way in New York. The pictures and scenes of New York are fantastic but will eventually change. The friendship between the two leads Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight is the odd relationship but becomes the emotional punch as they both try and survive. The opening with song Everybodys talking  playing is terrific as we see Joe Buck as he leaves his town behind, at this point we don't know why but we get a glimpse through the flashbacks. You can see his excitement initially but also we see how this changes with the grim reality.  Jon Voight looks a dashing cowboy but has the innocence to not understand. Cowboys are old hat now, and you see this later as he realises  times are changing as he enters Florida. Dustin Hoffman's Rizzo is an obscure character with the limp and the accent, but captures street smarts with the fact that New York has beaten him down very often. The movie is gritty, dark punctured with some disturbing elements. Joe's previous life shown in flashbacks has not been great from hints at abuse and elements with his girlfriend. We have a feeling he is trying to start his life again. The visual flashbacks interspersed with what is happening is very striking. There is a lot that still haunts Joe. New York is not a great place when you don't have much, people don't care and people don't treat you with respect. New York is seen as seedy, brutal and grim.  Two desperate characters needing each through their lonely existence. The director and cinematographer deserve praise as the flashbacks and psychedelic moments are a constant stream keep the story flowing.  Even the famous line i'm walkin here again suggests that they are lost in society and no one even knows or cares that they exist. A well acted film with the only downside is a more interesting second half which the eventual images of Florida reflected in Rizzo's empty expression on the bus. A interesting and raw look at what it was really like in down trodden New York.",

            "content": "John Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy \u2013 the only X-rated film to have won the Academy Award for Best Picture \u2013 is very much a product of its time. That isn't to say however that this bleak character-led foray into the seedy underbelly of New York life hasn't aged well, or that it is no longer relevant. On the contrary, with its themes of male prostitution and exploitation, it's ahead of its time.\nThe story follows Jon Voight's blonde-haired, blue-eyed Joe Buck as he leaves Texas for New York to make his fortune. Unusually, he plans to achieve the American Dream by hustling, cheerfully and optimistically imagining that attractive rich women will pay him for sex. The reality of course proves to be somewhat different; it this goes badly wrong when his first \"customer\" cast is deeply offended that he expects her to pay him and he ends up giving her some cash whilst trying to apologise. Hopelessly out of his depth, it doesn't take long for him to be so desperate for money that he realises that male prostitution is his best option. \nBuck soon meets Dustin Hoffman's limping, unhealthy conman \"Ratso\", who initially sees Joe as somebody he can exploit. But he understands how New York's seamy side works and how the na\u00efve Joe can make money from it, resulting in a friendship rooted in mutual dependence and growing into mutual affection to form the heart of the film. Midnight Cowboy is about these two characters and the relationship between them; they fascinate because of their flaws and contradictions. Waldo Salt's screenplay never explicitly explains why somebody as instinctively polite as Joe and with a seemingly wholesome upbringing would choose to make his fortune as a gigolo; a selection of dialogue-free flashbacks invites us to decide for ourselves, but Schlesinger makes them ambiguous. Thus, the monochrome nightmare that Joe has during his first night in Ratso's squat provides clues to a dark past \u2013 the gang-rape most obviously \u2013 but we can't be certain if it is memory or fantasy. Ratso also has fantasies, in which he is healthy, wealthy and on a beach, surrounded by admirers and with Joe for company. Whether he imagines Joe as just a friend or something more homoerotic is another ambiguity. The exact nature of what their friendship becomes always stays ever so slightly mysterious. Regardless, Joe is devoted enough \u2013 or dependent enough \u2013 on his increasingly sick friend that he savagely beats a man in order to steal his money (possibly killing him in the process), so that he can afford bus tickets for them both to go Florida. He's too late of course and the film's final scenes on the coach are memorably poignant.\nJon Voight and Dustin Hoffman give performances that look effortlessly convincing, and the rest of the cast members \u2013 many of them, such as John McGiver, cast against type \u2013 are all just as believable in a variety of often grotesque roles. But Schlesinger's direction is as a much a contributing factor to the film's classic status as the performances are. Revisiting the film in the nineteen-nineties, Roger Ebert criticised it for being gimmicky and it is, but that's part of its enduring appeal as a film made at the end of the sixties. The distinctive visuals feel like a response to the proceeding decade and this is epitomised by the psychedelic party scene, which takes the swinging sixties stereotype but makes it nauseating rather than appealing. \nAdam Holender's cinematography brings a stark beauty to opening shots as Joe travels across America. The editing builds on this to provide fades into flashback that draw the audience into the young man's mixture of memories and fantasies and later reflect his emotions, such as when the first sex scene is largely obscured by an increasingly rapid montage of television programs. When an enraged Joe leaves Mr O'Daniel in search of Ratso, we get fast cuts to black and white shots that show how Joe imagines this unfolding. When he's receiving a blow-job in the cinema, we see him imaging being with a woman whilst cuts to a science fiction B-movie chart the progress of his orgasm. And as the film unfolds, Fred Neil's cheery \"Everybody's talkin'\" gives way the wistful mournfulness of the harmonica in John Barry's iconic main theme, as Joe's optimism is ground down by the sleaziness that envelopes him.\nFor all of the film's depressing sleaziness, there is a thread of black humour in much of the dialogue, mainly when Joe and Ratso are bickering with each other. It helps to add realism to a relationship which defines the movie, showing us an unlikely friendship born out of sheer necessity and ending in tragedy. And it is that relationship that makes Midnight Cowboy such a great film.",

            "content": "Depressing, funny, gritty and difficult to watch while also being magnetic this is an odd film but one that makes it's case for being one of the Top 100 films of all time. Going into the film I was aware that I was going to find it disturbing and see the dark underbelly of the United States in the late 1960s. I have never seen a John Schlesinger directed film before but I plan to see Darling (1965) and Pacific Heights (1990) at some point in the future and I was aware of his reputation as a great director. The actors in the film need no introduction as Dustin Hoffman is brilliant in everything from The Graduate (1967) to The Meyerowitz Stories (2017) and Jon Voight starred in some of the greatest films of the 1970s. All of my expectations were exceeded as I walked away from this film shocked, horrified and surprisingly touched, this film earned the title of Best Picture.\n\nJoe Buck, Jon Voight, decides to move to New York City in hopes of attracting a wealthy older woman who will be willing to financially support him as he escapes his disturbing past in Texas. When he arrives he quickly realizes that he will struggle to find clients and hooks up with an agent, Ratso Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman, who defrauds him during their first meeting but they later become close friends and business partners. Buck eventually finds a client and begins getting paid but Rizzo is dying and wants Buck to take him to Florida which they will need $50 for. Buck goes to extraordinary measures to scrounge up enough money for the trip and the film ends tragically.\n\nThe film is shot very interestingly as we see flashbacks dropped in while Buck rides on the bus to New York City and encounters various odd figures representative of the cultural melting pot that is America. We see these flashbacks in black and white or contrasted with present day events, what exactly happened to Buck is never clear but we know that he is disturbed which is enough to understand why he is the way he appears. We also spend long periods of time simply watching the oddities that can be found in New York City as the posters, people and atmosphere of New York is fully captured in a film that is both dreamlike and terrifyingly realistic. This visual aesthetic really enhances the film as it fits the bizarre tone of the film as a whole, it is obvious that Schlesinger had a very specific vision and he executed it perfectly.\n\nAnother ingenious trick that the film pulls is that it makes you feel for people who are completely sleazy and disgusting in the actions they take but who can be caring and supportive for those they love. The central relationship between Buck and Rizzo works because they are both such oddballs and Hoffman and Voight have great chemistry. When we see Buck attempting to nurse his friend back to good health we believe that he is a good person and want to see him prosper. That's what makes it so horrifying when we see this man who is capable of compassion murder a repressed gay man who has treated him with respect for $50. The horrors of the American dream are on display here as the film forces you to understand how the means that justify the ends can be cruel.\n\nThe performances of the two lead actors are incredible as they far exceed that of Best Actor winner John Wayne in True Grit (1969). Voight's wholesome appearance and confidence makes him convincing as the idiotically na\u00efve man we meet at the beginning of the film but he is able to reveal emotional depth that makes his character sympathetic in the small moments. Hoffman matches him as he plays a comedic character who is equally ridiculous in presentation but seems grounded when compared to the figures that surround him. The two of them together are dynamite and I wanted to spend more time with them even as they became increasingly depressed.\n\nThis film absolutely deserved to win Best Picture as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) is hardly strong competition and the fact that They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969) was not nominated is criminal. I think the film earns it's reputation and is one of the greatest Best Picture winners ever.",

It's attitude towards women can be generously called 'antiquated', and it does drag a fair bit towards the end, but there have been few films which have better captured the pure horror and drudgery of destitution. Voight and Hoffman seem to be competing to steal the screen, and both play off each other brilliantly.  The movie has a very grubby aesthetic, like the film reels were dipped in grease and left to dry out in the hot sun, and it's completely cynical attitude towards both New York and humanity might not be pretty, but there are plenty glimmers of hope that keep our hustling heroes going. I was shocked by the ending twist, though admittedly I shouldn't have been, and Hoffman is so incredible that a single one of his expressions can make your heart go out to him, even when he's just been ripping someone off and running away with their cash. The look and tone will put many people off, but for those keen to take a close look at the seedy underbelly of big city living, few have done it more bleakly, or effectively, than Midnight Cowboy.",

The script can kind of fluctuate everywhere and there are some backstory sections that are left up to a little bit of interpretation, but those are really the only issues with the film. The main character has been messed up in the head by witnessing a gang rape, being a victim of gang rape himself, and possibly molestation by his guardians and so it's possible that the reason he wants to become a sex worker is because of a confused understanding of who he is. He gets swindled a lot at first because of his naivete, and then he quickly becomes hardened in order to survive homelessness. His interactions with Rico both add to this callousness and help to soften him back again. By the end he has realized that prostitution is too hard for him to survive on, and it's a good lesson for him because it appears that he has found himself, whereas before he struggled with self-identity. Obviously the showcase of the film is on the platonic brotherhood between the two main leads, Hoffman and Voight, and it's no wonder that they both got Oscar nods for their performances as they are acted perfectly. The film is a well-done tragedy, and I couldn't see too many critical errors within it, just a bit too trashy for me.",

He runs into quite a few problems including a con man played by Dustin Hoffman. However, eventually these 2 form a friendship that becomes the heart of the rest of the film. The journey for Joe Buck is intensified when they include a number of flashbacks that show the darkness of his past trauma. It helped me sympathize with his character, and feel very bad about all the things that happen to him. The subject matter isn't exactly my cup of tea, but I thought the presentation was fairly strong. Life can be dark for people in this kind of position, so the movie probably needed to be this way. I had some difficulty recognizing the significance of Hoffman's character because they didn't give him enough background or motivation, but I appreciated that Joe finally had someone he could connect with on a non-sexual basis. The weirdest thing in the movie was the way that the duo was ushered into the party that kicked off the climax of the movie. That really came out of left field, which kind of bugged me. I wanted some sense to it, some reason for it happening, but the movie offered none. The conclusion was tough, especially since I had started to see Joe as almost a child-like character, so his look of helplessness hit me hard. One last thing that should be noted is the brilliant performance of Jon Voight. The fact that I constantly refer to him as Joe in this review and not Jon is a sign how much he became the character. When I looked at Ratso I saw Hoffman, but standing next to him was simply Joe Buck. Midnight Cowboy is a deep movie, and the fact that it affected me emotionally makes me think it was very effective. I doubt I'll ever watch it again, but I have to admit it's a good film.",

            "content": "\"Midnight Cowboy\" achieves a profound sense of loneliness only vaguely found in film, and so it's disconcerting that it covers so much of its ground in art-house excursions to distract from its potent realism.  But it's the kind of movie able to emotionally shine through the experimental exterior crafted by its maker; we want to be turned off by its avant garde ways, but it bruises us psychologically, and is effective in its methods of portraying lives gut-wrenching in their hopelessness.  I'm not so sure it's one of the best films ever made, as history has made it out to be - we always are left desiring more, its stylish fluctuations too distracting to cause impenetrable coherency - but it is certainly one of the most important, and is thoroughly unforgettable in its images and textures.\n\tIts successes are propelled by leading actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, among the best of their generation and who give performances shattering in their empathetic girth.  Voight, \"Midnight Cowboy's\" anti-hero, is Joe Buck, a na\u00efve Texas native on his way to New York to make it as a hustler.  A misguided career goal it is, but Joe's determination is something to admire; he likes the way he looks, and figures he can make it in the Big Apple utilizing his perceived prettiness.\n\tBut this is a ruthless film, and it doesn't take long for him, and us, to realize that the life of a male prostitute is more a series of setbacks and violent meetings than fruitful undertakings.  He ends up striking up a friendship with con man Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman), a whiny cripple who initially promises to find him a pimp of sorts, but ends up being a confidant of desperate quality after things go awry.  And so the film follows them as they try to *make it* in a city that doesn't care about them, and there comes a point where we can tell they they can sense it, too.\n\t\"Midnight Cowboy\" screams to be strictly kitchen-sink, but is so bombarded with a smorgasbord of eye-catching imagery and stylistic asides (flashbacks, pop music, unfitting character musings on the part of its director, John Schlesinger) that we sometimes have the gut feeling that we'd know these fictional individuals a bit better if the movie weren't such a highbrow blend of counterculture artifice and documentary, street cruel realness.  A later Schlesinger feature, 1971's extraordinary \"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\" was more lucid because it watched its characters with the obsession of a voyeur, paying immaculate attention to their expressions, their motivations, and their habits, in all possible situations.  But the characters of \"Midnight Cowboy\" are stuck in a haze of rambling sideshow of editing tricks and twitchy artistic detours, some brilliant and some tonally degrading.  We almost fall in love with \"Midnight Cowboy,\" but when we take the leap, we fall into a cave of desire.  We wish it were more than what it is.\n\tAnd yet, it is still an incredible film, though I'm sure I've made it sound otherwise.  I have reservations about its classic status, but that doesn't stop me from recognizing its emotional immortality, and the way it impacted me.  Voight is sublime as Joe Buck, presenting the hopeful decline of his character in a fashion so subtle, so fluid, you'd swear tragedy were inevitable.  Hoffman is a riot as Rizzo until he isn't anymore; we're blindsided when we begin to understand that his downfall will be even bleaker than Joe's.  Sylvia Miles steals the show as one of Joe's older clients, and Brenda Vaccaro is a convincingly glamorous socialite he beds at the height of his depressive state.\n\t\"Midnight Cowboy\" is sad, a little offbeat, and more than unrelenting - it paints a life of failure so well you'll want to have a Nick-at-Nite sitcom marathon following its conclusion.  Its stirrings of melancholy are unshakable; I'm hesitant in rejoicing in how it presents itself, but I also know that its effects will never cease to swirl around in my cinematic heart.",

What starts out as an idealistic journey towards a new life quickly becomes a demonstration of the cruelty that comes with living, the harshness of the outside world, and the disgusting underbelly of rich, upperclass living. This is all fine and good until gay men and trans women are implicated in this squalor, their inclusion indicating their oppression but also coming off queasily homophobic, an obviously unintentional effect given that Schlesinger was gay himself. It's certainly possible that the two lead characters are gay themselves and suffer with some severe self-loathing, but even so, that wouldn't account for the technical issues. It also suffers from Schlesinger's desire to create a film that serves as a catch-all for late 60s underground culture, the flashy, sloppy, gimmicky direction serving to highlight these elements at the expense of the central narrative. Midnight Cowboy is a mangled work, a film bursting with ideas that nonetheless disappoints due to its refusal to commit being one of the many types of movies it clearly wants to be.",

            "content": "'Midnight Cowboy' is a lot of things; it is a dark, gritty, tragic, realistic and immersive experience of two people just trying to make it through to the next day. However, it is also very iconic, influential and groundbreaking in many ways, from its quotable lines to its heartbreaking and memorable soundtrack, with its excellent theme that still symbolises that there is still some hope and acting from its leads, this is a great film. \n\nThe film is indeed unrelentingly bleak and with the help of two excellent lead performances it really helps compound this message further, as well as those 'Rear Window' sound effects that make anything creepy. Jon Voight gave an excellent performance of someone wholly in for more than they bargained for, and in a classic moment of him walking down a crowded street we can see that with how out of place he looks. It takes some time to finally have him stay on screen, but when he does, Dustin Hoffman gives a typically excellent performance and the performance out of the two that resonated more for me; not to discredit Voight at all, I just found that character's plight all the more heartbreaking in a film that was already bleak to watch in the first place. And these two, somehow, still find humour. The film itself does have some humour as well, like any well rounded script would do, just because you're in a horrible situation doesn't mean that funny things won't happen but at one point Enrico falls down the stairs and someone says to him, 'hey you fell down the stairs', I thought he'd respond to that but that was still an oddly funny moment. I know it was improvised because of an accident but Hoffman's voice is his normal voice after he shouts, 'I'm walking here', and credit to him for doing so well in that moment, though. I'm surprised he hadn't have heard of that women's building before though and I thought his character would have disappeared after the truck went past him. Those two really needed a pimp, at least to just make sure they got their earning, even if it would have gotten violent, which Joe seemed to get unnecessarily dark near the end. I also found Joe a tad less likeable anyway, on the coach to New York he's just playing his seemingly always powered radio that never runs out of batteries pretty loudly, even if some others come on later who make more noise. I understand as the film goes on he is getting increasingly desperate but even so. We also get to see a young Bob Balaban in here too. \n\nHowever, I will say that I found it hard to believe their friendship for a while; it seemed for a little while that they didn't seem to like each other all that much and just stayed with each other because they had no other choice. When Joe picks up something for Enrico and quickly lets go of it because of the weight of it and Enrico makes a joke, he didn't think to mention that it was the weight that made him drop it so fast? Even Joe kept forgetting what Enrico wanted to be called, he finally does remember at the end though, which does show their development, he called him Rico a couple times on the first night as a joke and I thought he would have responded to that but he didn't. Before this they hadn't even been friends for a day and Joe says, 'sometimes you want to make me puke'. And perhaps I am missing the point but why didn't they both just try and get whatever money they could, together, and head off somewhere else, like Joe's home, for example. Or at least get a job of some kind? I know we wouldn't have our film otherwise and they do bring this up at one point, which leads into the end of the film which I won't spoil, but I kept thinking about that throughout the film. Someone could say they couldn't get a job with where they lived but I'm sure they could have found something to just get enough to leave that place for good, and I'm surprised their building lasted as long as it did, I was afraid it would get knocked down at some point. \n\nOne thing that I really liked in this film was its editing, the way that its visual style changed when it showed what a character was thinking, like the cinematography going slightly blurry when Joe was fantasising, was smart. The way that it was used to show us things from Joe's past was great, nothing was explained but it just showed us and was there for us to work out for ourselves, as well as many other tricks it does to fit the situation, it was really clever and creative and when Joe doesn't know if he can trust Rico yet, he appears as an antagonist in these visions as well. In some scenes near to the end they showed two things happening at once and it doubles as a way to save time, which makes sense. However, there was set up for a character's departure at the end of the film that I predicted would happen just from how it was filmed, it was still sad though and I wish he hadn't have put his clothes in the bin in that little scene beforehand! But it looked like he still would have had his purple shirt.\n\nPeople call the Oscar's these two won for the their next films, 'Coming Home' for Voight and 'Kramer Vs. Kramer' for Hoffman, makeups for this one but, hey, they both have a BAFTA and Golden Globe for Best Newcomer but they were both a part of this very original film and that's something. And, hey, Dustin Hoffman stars in another Best Picture winner in 10 years, woo. 'Midnight Cowboy' is a very unique film.",

Its a tale of misfortune while trying to chase a dream. You could feel the apathy from most people esp in New York and the wretchedness of the main leads. The main cowboy lead was so na\u00efve and innocent, completely opposite his street-smart con friend. The style of shooting was awesome from the director with some great visceral imagery and I loved the soundtrack. However, there was a lot of parts of the film that were left void, We barely got to know Joe's background or what happens to him at the end. Obvi there was some trauma there from his upbringing. Im sure the book fills you in more and Id  be interested to read it. Great performances from both leads here. The main win in this film is probably the great tale of an unlikely friendship between two people pushed aside by the world, their misfortunes pulling them together. What a depressing ending, but I kinda figured it would end like that poor Ratso Rico. He made it to his heaven tho in the end I guess. I would like to think people are better off than that now with social services.",

            "content": "\"Now, Mr. McGinty is a good man, but he's run away now with a cowboy hand (Add a certain \"J\" word here)! Let the midnight special shine her ever-loving light on me!\" I went with \"Midnight Special\", rather than \"Rhinestone Cowboy\", partly because this dude is so well-known for his midnight specials, and largely because, well, I already referenced \"Rhinestone Cowboy\" for my opener for \"Drugstore Cowboy\". Yeah, I watched \"Drugstore Cowboy\" sooner than this film, but hey, that's no more awkward than an X-rated film winning Best Picture before an R-rated film, and at any rate, as gay as Gus Van Sant is, I'd imagine he wishes that he did this film, especially considering just how successful his modern cowboy, or rather, cowgirl film ended up being. Maybe it's best that John Schlesinger did this film, because he was gay and Jewish, and this film is automatically super-Jewper for co-starring Dustin Hoffmensch-I mean, Hoffman. Even though this film is not as good as \"Brokeback Mountain\", it does make that film less impressive as a stool-I mean, boundary-pusher, which leaves me to doubt that this film was ever shot in Texas, because even in Austin, anyone would have been hanged for even being involved in a film about a \"cowboy\" who is a possibly latently gay male prostitute with a Jewish friend. I'd hate for that to happen if it meant the prevention of the completion of this film, because this is some good, thoroughly awkward cinema, although it isn't exactly consistently exciting.\r\n\r\nI did have my concerns about this film getting a little slow, and through sharp writing and reasonably tight direction, this film entertains just fine, but not on the whole, for there are occasions in which the film does, in fact, dry up, with borderline dull spots that retard the momentum of an already disjointed narrative. Well, this film is not that uneven, but that just makes the uneven touches all the more glaring, once the narrative actually does become disjointed, forcing along its progression, occasionally at a clip so snappy that it is actually some form of stylization, or rather, overstylization. The style of the film is also a little inconsistent, because the film is generally grounded and traditionalist in its storytelling style, until it gets to be borderline abstract in its snappy, but surreal editing and enigmatic visuals, which range from ethereal to break-neck, and shake up the focus of the storytelling. The overstylization is rare, but they are something of a long-term issue, in that they reflect an overambition to be an aesthetic achievement, something that this mostly dramatically rewarding affair is, to a certain extent, but not to the extent that John Schlesinger wants to push things. Natural limitations to this story concept are themselves limited, as this subject matter is so distinct and so compelling, but it is intimate to the point of minimalism, with only so much dynamicity and a lot of potential for underwhelmingness. The inspiration delivered on in the telling of this film manages to drive the final product as genuinely rewarding, but this effort can't afford to fumble too much, even if it only occasionally hits moments of dryness, unevenness and overstylization. The final product may be more ambitious than it should be, and yet, that ambition leads to enough inspiration to make this drama a rewarding one which transcends its minimalism to hit big, although not effective aspects are grand.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is anything but prominent in this film which mostly relies on clever dialogue and subtly flashy style to drive entertainment value, and when it is utilized, well, it mostly plays with Fred Neil's \"Everybody's Talkin'\" (Mighty good song, but you sure do get tired of it), but it does do a fine job of adding to the simple, but warm tone of this minimalist drama, at least when used just right by direction which does a lot of playing with style. I go on and on about John Schlesinger's directorial style, but it's mostly subtle, and when it really kicks up, it often shakes up the momentum of the film through unevenness and overstylization, but it's hard to not praise Schlesinger's use of Hugh A. Robertson's snappy editing, and of questionably placed, but haunting visuals which compliment the depth of this drama through aesthetic sophistication. One has to take what can be given when it comes to ameliorating this film's story, as it is minimalist in its intimacy, and therefore runs the risk of losing reward value, but this sensitive subject matter remains very respectable, in its edgy uniqueness, and in its human factor, carrying powerful themes about big city grime, homophobia and companionship that could be brought glowingly to life. The telling of this tale is certainly not glowing on the whole, but it is inspired, with screenwriter Waldo Salt delivering on a fine dialogue, tight set pieces, and nuance, while Schlesinger's style goes accompanied by a directorial thoughtfulness and biting, if relentless bleakness that, while often either a little dry or a little disturbing, is realized enough to rarely lose engagement value, often augmented with resonance. There are some enthralling moments found here and there throughout this intimate drama, but compellingness very, very rarely abates, as there is so much endearing thoughtfulness applied to the telling of this audacious affair, which, quite frankly, isn't able to save this film as engrossing on its own. I've criticized and praised the intimacy of this drama, but the best thing to come from it is its bringing Jon Voight - as a simple man in a complicated new setting - and Dustin Hoffman - as an ill con man fearing for his sorry life - to prominence, for although the leads of this film are given only so much to work with, their impeccable charismas and chemistry drive a lot of the charm of this film, and bond you with the human heart of this drama, really kept pumping by an intensity within Voight's and, of course, the show-stealing Hoffman's dramatic highlights that defines the depth of impact of this realist character study. Voight and Hoffman, or at least just Voight, carry the film, and secure the final product as genuinely rewarding, but not alone, for ambition is met enough with inspiration for the final product to transcend its natural and consequential shortcomings as an engrossing drama.\r\n\r\nOverall, dry spells retard momentum almost as much as disjointed moments in storytelling and overstylization, while ambition stresses natural shortcomings enough to threaten the reward value of the film, but on the backs of a few solid soundtrack bits, snappy stylistic highlights, audaciously intriguing subject matter, fine writing, inspired direction, and strong performances by and chemistry between Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, \"Midnight Cowboy\" stands a consistently compelling, if not rather powerful portrait on how a big city and grimy lifestyle can corrupt and enlighten a simple and good man.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

With Hoffman and Voight losing to John Wayne's iconic performance in \"True Grit\", Hoffman's performance had to prove a close second.

            "content": "Midnight Cowboy is a very interesting film considering the time period it came out in, it gives us a startling look into the darkness of the American dream, and it features one of the finest pair of acting performances ever to grace the screen. However, the film really fails to go any further than exposing a side of life that not many people see. For example, Joe Buck is a lost soul whose past is horrifying, yet his past is given very little significance for his now weary and wandering state. We see his past in very well edited flashbacks, and we see how it sometimes causes him to lose control, but Schlesinger fails to show us how this has affected his important decisions at all. The same goes for Ratso, we are shown how desperate he is, the filth he lives in, and how he lacks anything that would make a person happy, but why this is so is never explained to us. Waldo Salt won an Oscar for this screenplay, and I'm not really sure how, because most of this film's shallowness can be attributed to its exploitation of the troubles and despair of people who have lost their way in this world. Although, this film is relentlessly entertaining and should be commended for its ambition, it just lacks the visual and intellectual depth to be considered a masterpiece of American cinema. I watched it the first time, and failed to find a truly insightful message, so I rewatched it, and the shallowness is still there, but it remains very interesting. Watch this film for the atmosphere and performances, and you'll be pleased, but if your looking for more than an exploitation of the bleakness of the American dream, then you may be a little disappointed.",

The narrative is progressed, however, by moments of unconventional imagery, and there are enough such moments to justify calling it an art movie. These moments can be disturbing, particularly the rapid-fire flashbacks and flashforwards that play in the mind of Jon Voight's faux cowboy character. Traumatic memories and violent urges occupy his mind, though on the outside he seems relatively cheerful. Conversely, his unhappy friend Rico (an amazingly good Dustin Hoffman) has daydreams that are light and escapist. These dissimilar people make a good pair, and the nature of their friendship is tantalizingly ambiguous. The film is certainly dark, but thanks to likable characters and a lot of wry humor the darkness is not unrelenting or oppressive.",

But then a polio-crippled con man named Ratso cons him of $20 but later convinces Joe to stay at his place and be his manager, helping him to make a name for himself.\n\nYeah. I know it's probably really shocking to rate this movie so low, but trust me, if with wasn't for Jon Voight - but mostly Dustin Hoffman, or how this film worked in terms of story telling with its occasionally noticeable symbolism or story-telling with its editing, or if the movie in general wasn't any more X-rated, I wouldn't hesitate to rate this movie much lower then I did. If any of you have read my reviews for movies like Borat, and ESPECIALLY Hangover Part II, then you know that I can have a very seriously low tolerance when it comes to having nudity or sexual content in some of the most undeniably disturbing ways imaginable. And the fact that this was X-rated - the first and currently only winner to be X-rated at that - don't really help the film for me. I don't give a rats that they eventually re-rated it to just R, they rated it X first and I am sticking to that rating. Because yes, this film had ways of being pretty bad when it comes to its sex scenes or sometimes just scenes in general. So with that said, this film was by no means the highlight of my day when I saw it. However, as much as I dislike it, I do have to give it points to how good it is as a film. Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman gave out great performances - Dustin Hoffman especially was someone who I enjoyed and looked forward to the most when I was watching this film..I mean come on, it's Dustin Hoffman! And I admit that the editing worked really well with some of the symbolism or all around subtext to what was happening in some of the scenes... even when some of it is harder to understand then others and it can be a little confusing to know for sure what is real and what was just Joe or Ratso's imagination or one of Joe's flashbacks. And otherwise, the film plays out its grit very well with displaying the urban American life in New York.\n\nAnd that's my review for Midnight Cowboy, you may enjoy it for its performances from Voight and Hoffman, and otherwise how well its made as a film, but otherwise, it's just X-rated disturbing, making it hardly the best thing I've ever scene and is not recommended for people who have even half the low tolerance I have for sexual content in this disturbing kind of nature.",

I was very excited to see Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman teamed up, but the movie behind them is sadly disappointing.\n\nBefore seeing this, I had of course seen classics such as \"Taxi Driver\" which showcased much of the same as this: the disgusting lowlives of New York; the bad side of it.  \"Taxi Driver\" executed it, however, better.\n\nThe story starts out with Jon Voight on his way to New York to prosper there, wanting to become a hustler to make tons of money.  He soon learns that many people there, such as Rico \"Razzo\" Rizzo, love to make money illegally or deviously.  I did like the setup; the backdrop of New York City, the actors, and trying to start a new.  However, it was all very disappointing in the end.\n\nI liked everything up to the \"I'm walking here!\" scene.  The song \"Everybody's Talkin'\" was a great introduction, Jon Voight proved he was a great actor, and Dustin Hoffman's character acted as comic relief at first.  He really proved himself with \"Ratso\" to be a fantastic actor.  Plus, the background of Joe Buck was also very intriguing.  He had been scarred with a series of events, the eventual one being rape.    \n\nBut with that comes a very weird and non-parallel character.  Joe Buck seems very innocent, but in actuality should seem very pessimistic and scarred.  Instead he seems to be a very happy person.  Perhaps it was the directing, but I felt the character did not fit his background.\n\nAfter Joe Buck is screwed over in a deal with \"Ratso,\" he makes ends meet by hustling once again, catering to people of all sorts, which makes for a very uninteresting setup.  One thing that was interesting was what a religious man (whom Ratso had set up for Joe to meet in a deal) said in conversation with Joe.  He had called him a lost soul, and despite being close friends with Ratso, that's what Joe ends up being in the end.  \n\nThe movie did present an interesting message, but I felt the material that helped present the message, hustling, was very poor.  Hustling in and of itself was presented just fine, but hustling is just a bad way to tell a story.  Plus, the people who Joe catered to were very disturbing individuals.  Hustling didn't make for an entertaining movie.\n\nThe acting was powerful, though.  \"Ratso\" is now one of my favorite movie characters and Joe Buck provided for a protagonist, but I was always praying for another scene with \"Ratso.\"  Together, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman's performances were great. \n\nIf it weren't for the, music, acting and actors, I would've completely passed on this movie.  I wanted to see it for its importance in cinema and the fact that I appreciate buddy movies, but the material here is questionable.  Hustling is a very tricky subject to handle.  I suppose this might be the best example of its presentation in cinema, but that's not saying a whole lot when the subject itself is disgusting.  I fail to see, however, how it's had such an impact on American cinema.",

That's when the crippled, coughing, stealing, and nasally-voiced Ratso invites him to stay in Rizzo's home on a condemned lot. Because they are both just trying to survive on the streets of New York, they befriend each other. When they are not walking the streets, stealing, or trying to bring in money, they talk and we slowly see into the pitiful lives of Joe and Ratso. Since winter has hit, Ratso gets ill so they decide to head out to Florida. On the way Rico (as he wanted to be called) spent his last breath. Both actors have powerful performances and Nillson's Everybody's Talking is a nice added touch to the soundtrack.",

            "content": "How this sordid movie ever got made by a major studio is beyond my realm of comprehension but thank god it did. What's even more perplexing is it wasn't even promoted to cash in on the success of Easy Rider because the film actually came out a few months before it. Still it was not without its controversies, only being hailed as a classic recently and being given an X rating initially for homosexual themes. But the movie impressed people with its ballsy and gritty adherence to the New York Street style most if not all of its scenes shot on location, and indeed a lot of elements of the film being improvised and left to chance. It stands today as English Director John Schlesinger is biggest achievement in both commercial and critical viability, and even though the shines off the apple its impossible not too if nothing else admire its balls and flair given the time. It wasn't the first but this is definitely the definitive coming to the Big Apple movie, and made both a star of Jon Voight and established Dustin Hoffman as a character actor. But how should we view it by today's standards? Despite its influence and precedence how does it really hold up as its own film? Let's take a walking here look.\r\n\r\nMidnight Cowboy is really the story of Joe Buck (Jon Voight) a simple minded, Texas dishwasher who plans to woo women in New York with his John Wayne aping Cowboy earthiness. No sooner does he arrive on New York's mean streets than he starts to be taken for a ride however and is hustled and extorted into homelessness becoming a cheap gigolo to barely get by. That is until he teams up with one of the people who conned him the cripple Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman)living with him in a condemned apartment and taking his advice and leadership to become a successful high class escort. Even as the two become more accustomed to one another things don't always work out but both now disillusioned with the Big City have plans to get themselves a bus ticket to Miami where things will be better. The film also becomes a tale of two lost souls clinging together in the vacuum of New York as much as it is about the hardships of street life especially as Joe Buck's real reasons for leaving Texas unravel.\r\n\r\nWhat surprised me most about the movie was how much I liked the directing as this was the first Schlesinger movie I'd ever seen. The movie has crisp and bright cinematography that gives New York and the film in general a colorful feel that feels fairly unique. It also features cutting edge direction in its extensive use of dream sequences, nightmarish flashbacks and even a drugged out party scene all of which make for a surreal experience. Aside from the breathtaking visuals the film also features as is clear from the description a dark and balls out story. Joe Buck's reason for leaving Texas is a scene not lightly forgotten for its horrifying reality, and the rest of the story if a little staged still smacks of realism from start to finish. Though not as progressively as some might like by today's standards the film does openly deal with homosexuality, Joe Buck encountering three horny males who employ him in varying capacities and a sexual desire for him by Ratso is hinted at as well. If a complaint can be made it's that at times particularly when Joe and Ratso live in the ratty apartment it can feel jarringly fake with the rest of the movie both the story and the set like feeling and also at times like these the city doesn't feel as large as it kid. But the latter could also be a commentary on the phenom of being lonely amongst millions. However you choose to view it the story is impeccably crafted and shot, and Voight and Hoffman more than do the central characters justice. Voight gives his finest performance playing a charmingly dumb country boy but also hinting at an inner cunning and manipulative nature at times not easy to pull off. But Hoffman is indeed the breakaway of the film his repulsive yet heart wrenching portrayal of Ratso particularly in the Graveyard and final scene tough to watch. And seriously who can't watch him scream \"I'M WALKING HERE!\" at a car for hours.\r\n\r\nMidnight Cowboy was a deserved success, the New York Street version of Easy Rider that is honestly a little better. If there are problems with it I'll be damned if  I know what they are it's got a great if repetitive soundtrack, compelling characters and narrative, and is one of the best looking movies of its time what's not to like? Sadly I'd say its popularity has dwindled a little, being only discussed for a few scenes and not its tough to handle ones but ones dealing with walking around in New York which frankly makes for less interesting discussion. But to those with a more avid interest in films as social commentary they will find much more in this gem of 60s cinema for years to come. Every scene is a delight, and it's incredibly consistent from start to finish which is rare for the time. If you can't tell I highly recommend it, this movie is one of my favorites.",

Jon Voight is excellent as the naive stud from the friendly south out of place and out of time, who goes to the big city (New York) in search of a fast buck but finds it isn't quite what he expected. Dustin Hoffman is masterful as Ratso Rizzo, the man dealt a shitty hand by life trying to scratch an existence just another day by whatever means necessary- just really convincing. But that story on its own is, dare I say it, rather clich\u00e9. What lifts it above that is the masterful direction of John Schlesinger, by turns avant garde and nostalgic, but always on point with the simple story. However, it's the last third of the movie when the tragedy of their situation and the humanity and inhumanity lifts this film to the heights. You know what's going to happen, but it's still affecting.\n\nAnd then you have the fantastic soundtrack, utterly untouchable. \n\nHere we have the American dream laid bare, dissected and left for dead.

It tugs at my curiosity about what his life was like before he met Joe, and what his motives were to become friends with the most unlikely person out there.  It was obvious what the director was trying to go for when it came to what kind of relationship these two men had with each other.  Their was no really hiding it.  These two were lovers, and for that to be shown on the big screen in 1969 was a major step forward in the movie business.

Kramer, Rain Man, The Graduate, and this movie). The thing about all those movies, are that the characters he portrays in each one is very different from the other roles. To that same extent Jon Voight is also very very good. He plays the naive Texas dumby to perfection. He almost seems like a really big kid at the beginning. At the end on the bus we see he's come full circle, grown up one could say. He talks about getting a real job and doing real work and not trying to be a hustler. All in all this movie story wise was very bizarre, but the amazing performances by the cast more then makes up that.

            "content": "Midnight Cowboy was and remains an explicit revelation of the brewing film exploitation that arose in the 1960's. It's gritty and realistic as it exposes sex, drugs, hedonism, and alcohol in the cosmopolitan cluster New York City. It was a statement of the time and is eerily significant today. \n\nJon Voight is Joe Buck--a hearty, naive Texan who journeys to New York City in hopes of becoming a successful \"hustler\". Women over there are golden and have garish lofts and tall penthouses; they're financial reimbursement is Buck's manifest destiny. There's also Dustin Hoffman as the scene-stealing \"Ratso\" Rizzo (I think he inspired Jim Henson's Rizzo the Rat)--a native New Yorker who yearns to voyage to the sunny beaches of Florida in the hopes that the climate will alleviate his ailment. The two form an unlikely pair, because in a city like New York that promises wealth and fame, they only have each others backs to survive. And this is why Midnight Cowboy is successful in its story (past all of the subliminal exposure). It portrays two very similar characters, paralleled with troubles and anguish. \n\nSurprisingly, it is the friendship which drives the film--not sex. Sex is certainly an important part to Buck's character. In his desperation he subjects himself to fellatio with another man just for money; the result is a swift swindle. But, Buck must keep his image. Like any \"John Wayne\" inspired cowboy, he shrugs his shoulders and shuffles on to his next \"client\". But opposite to Buck is Enrico Rizzo, who was nicknamed \"Ratso\" by the New York locals. I don't think Ratso was always and forever referred to as \"Ratso\"--but he's the finest example of what New York City can regurgitate to those who succumb to failure. Ratso lives in a thatched, tacky apartment in the slums of the city. He frequents mediocre coffee shops and propels himself into the acquaintances of \"fags\" and barmen. He may not look very healthy, but Ratso knows New York City up and down. It is hardly as glamorous and immaculate as Joe Buck assumes. This, being the film's pivotal message, is something Buck learns gradually from Ratso--who progresses from a casual acquaintance to a genuine friend whom Buck supports. \n\nIt's interesting how Buck and Ratso are uncanny in their virtues but bear little to no physical resemblance. Buck is the personification of Texas (a tall rodeo man with a ten gallon hat). If he assumed his \"stud\" status forever, I believe he would've turned into Ratso (granted he had little brains for that ten gallon hat). Ratso on the other hand isn't the strapping man Buck is, but his dreams and aspirations are equally as integral. They are both two characters who were robbed and conned into thinking that the purity of the American Dream was a few easy steps away. Says Buck, \"I'm new in town, from Texas. I'm lookin' fer the Statue of Liberty.\" Ratso lives there and he either never found it or determined it unreachable. \n\nAnd yes, the remainder of the film is rather illustrative and gratuitous in its depiction of sex and drugs (Buck has his first blunt amid the shindig), but it should not be identified as an X-rated exploitation film. The grungy 1960's setting serves to highlight the struggles of the two main characters. It is their Hell. Their boulevard of broken dreams.",

The main character, Joe Buck, played by Jon Voight, is a hustler who apparently lends his services to either gender, though he prefers women. Both him and Dustin Hoffman, the other main character gave excellent performances which seemed to resonate well with my impression of what people were like in the 1960's. The friendship between the two was very genuine and unique. As for the story itself, I'd say there have been many movies since that have surpassed it, making it seem less groundbreaking than it was at the time.

The film really does a great job of depicting the struggle to just survive in the urban landscape. Stylistically, it was just the right amount of weird. Very much ahead of its time in that sense. Dream/nightmare sequences were extremely well done. It ends beautifully. My only issue is that I didn't connect to the characters as strongly as I would have liked. I'll have to see it again to figure out why that is. In retrospect, I feel like I am connecting with them more, but at the time of viewing, I know I didn't...

            "content": "Based on a James Leo Herlihy novel, British director John Schlesinger's first American film dramatized the small hopes, dashed dreams, and unlikely friendship of two late '60s lost souls. Dreaming of an easy life as a fantasy cowboy stud, cheerful Texas rube Joe Buck (Jon Voight) heads to New York City to be a gigolo, but he quickly discovers that hustling isn't what he thought it would be after he winds up paying his first trick (Sylvia Miles). He gets swindled by gimpy tubercular grifter Rico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) but, when Joe falls in the direst of straits, Ratso takes Joe into his condemned apartment so that they can help each other survive. Things start to look up when Joe finally lands his first legit female customer (Brenda Vaccaro) at a Warhol-esque party; Ratso's health, however, fails. Joe turns a final trick to get the money for one selfless goal: taking Ratso out of New York to his dream life in Miami. One of the first major studio films given the newly minted X rating for its then-frank portrayal of New York decadence, Midnight Cowboy was critically praised for Schlesinger's insight into American lives, with the intercut mosaic of Joe's memories and Ratso's dreams lending their characters and actions greater psychological complexity. While they may have been drawn by the seamy content (tame by current standards), the young late '60s audience responded to Joe's and Ratso's confusion amidst turbulent times and to the connection they make with each other despite their alienation from the surrounding culture.\r\n\r\nStarring, Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight, Sylvia Miles, John McGiver, Brenda Vaccaro , Barnard Hughes , Ruth White , Jennifer Salt , Gil Rankin , T. Tom Marlow , George Epperson , Al Scott , Linda Davis.\r\n\r\nDirected by John Schlesinger.\r\n\r\nWinner of 3 Oscars including Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay. other nomination include Best Lead Actor Dustin Hoffman, Lead Actor Jon Voight, Supporting Actor Sylvia Miles and Film Editing. a total of 7 Nominations.\r\n\r\nnot this is a very well done drama movie based on a novel. one of the bravest choices of Academy for Best Picture. though it wasn't that explicit or something that it got an X rating when it was released making it the first X rated movie ever to get an Best Picture Oscar and second nominated one with A Clockworks Orange. this was a bit cruel. but then the had to change their decision by giving it a R rating afterward without any editing and chopping of scenes been done.\r\n\r\ni caught this movie on TV last night, it was one of those classic movies that i couldn't wait to watch. i wasn't able to watch the first 12 minutes but still i did and i loved. this movie maybe a bit uncomfortable to watch but it shows life in such big place, what actually life is for every type of people no matter what they are, no matter what they do.\r\n\r\nyou learn alot from this movie, i loved the friendship between the two characters Ratso and Joe. memorable characters and memorable scenes. i was surprised to hear that it was Jon Voight's debut movie he gave a good performance very perfect kind of attitude and whole accent and stuff he really pulled it off very well. he though isn't a very good looking one but that is not the point here. you can see how honest his performance was. those uncomfortable moments to the shocking flashbacks the friendship or just being him he did it perfect. quite smashing performance but the one who really stands out is our very beloved Dustin Hoffman, he delivers a bravo Two thumbs Up performance and a very memorable and quoted character as well. he deserved Oscar for his portrayal of a dying and troubled poor man in New York as Ratso or what he used to love hearing, Rico. we see such a brilliant ability of him to perform such amazingly in his movie The Graduate to this. he definitely is a powerhouse performer. an excellent performance. Sylvia Miles who i would like to mention was a surprise since just for a 4 minutes screen appearance, she got a Best Supporting Actress Nomination which is a record. i thought that crying scene she did perfectly, she plays Cass, the first woman in New York that offers Joe what he wants but ends up oppositely.\r\n\r\nthe whole look of the movie is old and the style and fashion is exquisite though very shocking but its the characters of Joe and Ratso along side the performers themselves who keeps it grounded and adds tremendous moral values to the movie. no matter what they are, what they do they are human beings and feels like everyone else. Direction was very well done. i found Screenplay very well written that engages you. not a dull, boring or flawed moment. brilliant performances and editing. nice score, good cinematography and art direction.\r\n\r\nit has one of the most emotional and sad endings that just breaks your heart. i found the movie extremely compelling and thought provoking while culturally significant. i found the handled the subjects of Sex and prostitution in their purest forms and appreciate the work of the makers for bringing this classic movie to screen while being aware of the odds. a brilliant movie.

            "content": "Daydream Against Reality; Reality Wins  \r\n\r\nLike everyone else, I'm going to start this review by talking about its Oscar record; unlike everyone else, I'm going to look at Best Supporting Actress first.  (Don't worry; I'll get to it.)  Sylvia Miles was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this film for the role of Cass, losing to Goldie Hawn in [i]Cactus Flower[/i].  I haven't seen the latter; it seems to be some sort of light comedy of the sort that you'd expect Goldie Hawn to have been in back in 1969.  However, I'm certainly not going to argue that Miles should have won instead, because I literally did not remember which character she was.  There are two women in this movie with whom Our Hero substantially interacts in New York, and there's his grandmother (Ruth White) and Crazy Annie (Jennifer Salt) in flashback, but women aren't part of the story.  Not really.  Cass, for the curious, is the first woman Joe picks up in New York, the one who doesn't realize he's a prostitute.  It's a moving bit of acting, but were there no better roles to be nominated?\r\n\r\nJoe Buck (Jon Voight) leaves Texas to go to New York and sleep with rich women for money.  He calls himself a hustler, and he would never think of applying the word \"prostitute\" to himself.  Which is just as well, really, given that we only see him successfully collect money for sex once over the entire film.  He is himself hustled, albeit not sexually, by Enrico Salvatore Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), saddled with the unfortunate nickname of \"Ratso.\"  Joe thinks Rizzo is introducing him to a pimp, but instead, it's a screwy religious fanatic.  Joe eventually finds Rizzo again, completely by accident, and they end up forming a strange partnership, the worldly Rizzo helping the na\u00efve Joe through the world of Times Square.  They even end up at an Andy Warhol party--minus Andy but plus a lot of his hangers-on.  All through this, the ailing Rizzo has a dream of getting away to Florida and living well there instead of in a condemned building in Manhattan.\r\n\r\nThe simple fact is, Joe isn't very bright.  He really does seem to think that making lots of money \"hustling\" is as simple as picking rich women up on the street.  He doesn't realize that most male prostitutes have male customers.  He doesn't realize, no matter how many times Rizzo tells him, that rich women won't just go down to Times Square and pick some random guy off the street.  Toward the end, he comes to the realization that getting an actual job is a better answer for himself, and I suspect he starts to regret ever having left Texas in the first place.  Shirley (Brenda Vaccaro), the woman he picks up at the Warhol party, might be an in to a successful career as a hustler, but I don't think it even occurs to Joe that he's going to get older and less desirable.  Sex appeal only goes so far, and Joe's is bound to run out someday.  He hasn't thought about what he'll do then, because he hasn't thought that it will happen.  It doesn't occur to him that life doesn't just work the way you want it to.\r\n\r\nMany people talk about Joe's homosexuality, but I don't actually think he's gay.  Bi, possibly, but I think he really enjoys sex with women.  I don't think his relationship with Rizzo is at all sexual.  I think Rizzo has taken this big, dumb galoot from Texas under his wing because he knows that gratitude is better than vengeance.  I think he figures Joe can be a meal ticket for him.  Honestly, I'm not even sure he likes Joe all that much.  In his fantasy sequence about a successful life pimping Joe, he is himself the desirable one, the important one.  The powerful one.  He is dying, and I think he knows he is dying, and his goal is just not to die alone.  And if that means hanging around with Joe, well, that's better than alone.  What's more, Joe has the physical strength and attraction to make those last days more comfortable.  Rizzo is an actual hustler--the difference being that you have to be smarter than the people you hustle--who is making it okay.  But Joe makes it better.\r\n\r\nOkay, so now, let's talk about that X.  What you may not know is that the MPAA was too stupid to trademark the X.  They didn't think anyone would voluntarily give their film a rating which, to be realistic, meant you couldn't play it in a majority of the theatres in the US.  A huge majority at that.  So \"X\" began to mean porn, almost exclusively, and I think most people think this movie is a lot more graphic than it really is.  In fact, it's pretty tame by modern standards.  However, the MPAA has always been skittish on the subject of homosexuality.  I've got a movie coming in from Netflix which I am given to understand got [i]its[/i] X because it's about lesbians.  Graphic or not didn't enter into it; the subject matter was all it took.  We've calmed considerably on that topic over the last forty years, though the MPAA somewhat less than the country as a whole.  A [i]Midnight Cowboy[/i] made today would probably be a lot more aware of the kind of life Joe Buck was really letting himself in for, thought that probably would get an NC-17.  But believe me, I've seen harder R movies in the theatre.",

Combine with its provocative themes of Male Prostitution, and Homosexuality, its depiction of Sex and its unflattering look at poverty in a big U.S city it's no wonder why this film sparked a wave of controversy upon its original realise yet alone winning the Oscar for best picture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plot: A young and naive Texas Cowboy called Joe Buck (Jon Voight) quits his job as a dishwasher in a small Diner and heads for NYC with the idea that becoming a male prostitute will help save many lonely and sexually deprived Women in the Big Apple. As the old saying goes Joe learns that the grass isn't always greener on the other side when he finds that trying to be a prostitute in NYC is not what he thought it would be. Joe's life spirals down into a life of poverty and when he befriends the ill Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), the pair try to break even in the prostitution business while trying to escape their life of poverty. \r\n     \r\nWith two brilliant performances by Voight and Hoffman, a great script, and its groundbreaking move to show daring and then taboo themes, MIDNIGHT COWBOY is one groundbreaking film worthy of a rating of 80% from me.",

With this in mind, I prepared myself for a disturbing, confronting film with no limits. It was this but so much more.\r\n\r\nJoe Buck (Voight) is a texas cowboy try-hard. He is leaving his weird little town for the Big Apple. It appears his grandma ma was a bit of a strange hussy and he seeks to follow in her footsteps. He finds himself in New York City with one thing on his mind, bagging a rich babe. He wants to sell himself to any fine looking lady he sees on the streets. But he soon discovers that this is not as easy as he first thought.\r\n\r\nEnter 'Ratso' (Hoffman). His real name? Enrico Rizzo. A cripple from the Bronx who lives in a condemned building with no heat, no electricity. He's a sad little man; a conman, a thief and a swindler. It's like he's Buck's character personified. After a few disturbing encounters with various people, Ratso and Buck find themselves at a psychedelic party with babes, drugs, cameras and, most importantly, free food. They've hit the jackpot.\r\n\r\nWhen Buck goes home with a wealthy lady, Ratso is left to fend for himself. He starts to get sicker and sicker. Buck is having the time of his life. He now has contacts, vital for his kind of work in NYC. But Ratso's condition is dire and for once Buck thinks of some one other than himself and decides to bus it with Ratso to Miami. This is a turning point for Cowboy Joe. He finds he has a heart and is willing to sacrifice his own success for the benefit of someone else. He is redeemed.\r\n\r\nThis film was difficult to watch. The confronting scenes leave you feeling empty and sad. It is not a glamourous life that Buck has chosen for himself. There is no joy in his work, even when he gets it. The initial excitement of New York City has gone and his soul is withered. \r\n\r\nJon Voight is almost unrecognisable as his younger, more handsome self. He is mesmerising as the naive and cocky Buck. And Hoffman is outstanding as usual. This is not a film for a sunny, happy day. It won't make you feel good, it may actually leave you with a foul taste in your mouth. It was made to shock and in comparison to the previous year's Best Picture, Oliver, I'm sure that it would have packed a punch. \r\n\r\nCheck it out if you dare. Just hang out for the poignant ending.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Midnight Cowboy' Trivia:\r\n\r\n* Budget - $3.6 million\r\n* Based on the novel, 'Midnight Cowboy' by James Leo Herlihy\r\n* Hoffman wore pebbles in his shoes to help with his limp\r\n* Dustin Hoffman auditioned for Ratso by dressing in rags and standing on a New York City corner, begging for money. The studio rep didn't even recognise him\r\n* According to Hoffman, the famous line, \"Hey, we're walking here.\" was unscripted and came about when a random taxi ran a red light and almost ran him over\r\n* The Florida bus driver was the set's electrician filling in for a missing extra",

What really makes the film is Voight and Hoffman's chemistry together, a love/hate relationship that propels this meandering film through the dark urban reality of late 60's NYC. Its momentum is often halted for a number of aimless flashbacks and dream sequences which try to provide insight into Voight's character, not realizing that everything we need to know is right there in Voight's performance, and that the real main character here is the city and its desperate, dirty citizens. Still, Midnight Cowboy is a landmark film, and if its X-rated (now justifiably re-rated as an R) view of the world doesn't seem quite so shocking today, perhaps it's just all the more relevant.",

            "content": "Midnight Cowboy, even after over 40 years later still holds up today. It's a touching story, well-made and well-told with some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo, gives one of his best - it's a bit funny at times (he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks - maybe because of the Lenny/\"Simpsons\" connection), but Hoffman is entirely convincing. Half of the film's budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in Hollywood. Opposite him is the second-billed Jon Voight as Joe Buck, the \"cowboy\" who travels North to the Big Apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute. Soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named \"Ratso\" - who offers to become Joe's \"manager\" for a certain percentage of profits.\n\nThe movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long. Some films can tend to drag, especially some of the films that were made in the '70s because as it's been said in the \"Easy Riders, or Raging Bulls\" the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material, going on too long examining characters/scenes/etc. that aren't important. Just about the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party - it makes the film seem extremely outdated (similar to the drug odysseys in \"Easy Rider\") and really harms its flow because it's not needed.\n\nOther than that, \"Midnight Cowboy\" is an almost flawless motion picture. I was pleasantly surprised. It does have its flaws (flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been, for instance) and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy (such as the gay movie theater sequence) but if you can handle its content \"Midnight Cowboy\" is a truly great motion picture, an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late '60s/early '70s. It's a depressing movie, yes, and by today's standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of \"life is horrible, etc.\"...but I still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with you for a long, long time.\n\nHighly recommended. One of the best films of the '70s. (It was technically released in late 1969 but I'd still categorize it as a 1970s film. It also won the Best Picture Oscar, being the first - and only - X-rated motion picture to do so. It was later re-rated R on appeal.)",

Still, it was interesting and I would say that Hoffman's and Voight's performances make the movie worth watching.

There was hardly any real story to speak of, and the main characters were not likable at all. I thought Joe Buck was a complete idiot.

Just like the cowboy costume that Joe Buck (Jon Voight) sports for most of the film, New York appears to be a city of impressive appearances, only to be revealed as a hollow wasteland of ambitious and broken dreams.\r\n\r\nIt is superbly acted by Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who's portrayal of Ratso Rizzo is perhaps his best role, and the two make the film worthwhile. It is a buddy film above everything else, and you can't help but care deeply about these characters as they grow.\r\n\r\nThe highlights of the film, however, come from the dense and experimental(we're talking 1969 here) montages that layer the film. Whether they are providing valuable windows into Buck's earlier life or showing what is perhaps one of cinema's best portrayals of the effects of marijuana, they are amazing to watch.\r\n\r\nMidnight Cowboy, through all the grit and tragedy of the characters on screen, is inspired and original, and in retrospect will make you smile.",

            "content": "3.5/4.0 \r\n\"Midnight Cowboy\" still stands out today as one of cinema's most unique, unexpected and poignant buddy movies. The story of two lonesome men who form an unusual friendship also offers a very powerful and realistic look at the underbelly of the American society as depicted by the disadvantaged lead characters and how they through in life. The movie is famous for being the only X-rated movie (now reduced to R) to win a Best Picture Oscar but the movie is relatively tame in today's terms while tackling controversial sexual subject matters including male prostitution, rape and homosexuality. \r\n Jon Voight is charming and subtly moving in his first key role as Joe Buck, a Texas dishwasher who moves to New York to work as a male prostitute believing he is the answer to all women's prayers. But his quest turns out to be easier said than done and after a number of instances of naivet\u00e9 he goes broke. The first woman he offers his services to, middle aged married New York socialite Cass (Sylvia Miles in a great 4-minute brief role), he ends up paying her after it turns out she lacks taxi fare.\r\nThen there is Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman in the movie's standout performance and one of his career best roles that totally sheds his \"The Graduate\" image from a few years prior to this movie's release), a crippled conman who takes twenty bucks off Joe to supposedly introduce him to a pimp only to send him to a religious fanatic. When Joe accidentally encounters Ratso again after hitting rock bottom and losing his accommodation, Ratso offers Joe to move in with him in his wretched house and over time he offers his services as a manager to abysmal results. \r\nHow the relationship between the two develops is a revelation and the ending is just heart-breaking. We also get to know about the character's pasts as the story progresses. For Joe, it is mostly through dream and fantasy sequences - he had a rough past being raised by an awkward and men-loving grandmother and departing from his loved one after a tragic incident that I will not reveal. John Schlesinger's direction is simply superb especially in those dream/fantasy flashback sequences. There is also a great hallucigenic scene where Ratso and Joe go to a Warhol-esque party. Winner of 3 Oscars: Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay (by Waldo Salt from the 1965 novel by James Leo Herlihy). Nominated for 4 others: Actor (Hoffman), Actor (Voight), Supporting Actress (Miles), Editing.",
