The chemistry between Newman and Redford is undeniable, Conrad Hall's cinematography nicely captures the arid beauty of America's southwest, and the great William Goldman's screenplay is filled with witty dialogue.  Despite all of its attributes, the middle portion of the movie feels like it drags as director George Roy Hill seems content to show scene after scene of the two protagonists trying to elude the posse that's tracking them, endlessly alternating between shots of the pursuit and the escape.",

There were some really well done and suspenseful scenes, plus good choices of songs/music and good shots of the landscapes where their adventures, retreats, and heists took place. It had a powerful ending as well and while some might not like it because the picture montages, they were done in a creative way imo. The kind of movies that make you sympathize the most with the bad guys only got bigger and better after this movie!",

This isn't a western film, like I maybe accidentally assumed it to be, although it does have a western feel to it. Its not full of action, though there is plenty of that at times. Its a good character driven drama, with some very witty dialogue and some quite amusing scenes, plus some reasonably tense moments too. \n\nI could have done without the montage mid way through shot in old fashioned brown  - with music playing over still shots but I guess it helps tell the story of what isn't being shown on screen, namely the two criminals travelling to Bolivia. I found the incidental music played in the background a short while later quite amusing too. I was surprised how entertaining and amusing this was really. Also I can't not compliment it on the great wide landscape shots. The cinematography certainly isn't bad. Given this film dates from 1969, it stands up quite well and I'd certainly recommend this.",

I'm sure, at the time, mixing late 60s jazz/pop music courtesy of Burt Bacharach was a novel thing to do, but it just doesn't play well for a Western.  Many of the visuals are similarly \"experimental\" and fall flat...especially some of the transitions between scenes where they go from one location to another.  There's a chase scene in the middle of the movie that you could leave the theater, go to the bathroom, get some popcorn, and maybe go for an oil change without missing the end of it...the scene that is...not the end of the movie.  The inbetween is fairly uninteresting during the chase.  Sure, there are some funny lines, but overall, there are much, much better Westerns, and, as I previously stated, you can watch a much better movie with Newman and Redford called, \"The Sting.\"",

It is a different kind of western, but in my mind, that is not a bad thing, quite the contrary. I loved the first ten minutes, that was very clever and refreshing. The cinematography is fabulous, doing perfect justice to the beautiful scenery. The score is suitably jaunty, and the Raindrops Falling on My Head interlude is a wonderful touch and quite moving come to think of it. The script is witty and infectious, not to mention memorable, and the direction and pace I had no problem with either. Robert Redford and especially Paul Newman are perfect as the charismatic outlaws and their chemistry is simply unforgettable. All in all, just a great movie and one of my favourites of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Examples: \"I'm stealing your woman!\" \"You can have her!\" and \"Rules? What rules-uggh!\"\n\nBut the movie's initial light, fun tone vanishes once Butch and Sundance are set upon by the hired trackers, and they discover just how much they man they stole money from disliked being robbed. Unfortunately, this initially tense chase sequence becomes slow and boring as it drags on, and the movie never recovers, even in the end when the outlaws have finally realized that they have entrapped themselves with no chance of escape.\n\nThe actual story of the outlaws would be a great basis for a future movie.",

The dynamic between Newman and Redford would change that completely, as they demosntrated that Westerns could stand to have actual charisma rather than machismo exclusively. The film delivers a distinct blend of comedy and charm mixed with sincere commentaries on the declining West and finding yourself outdated (but not yet dead). However, there are some weaknesses as well, most prominently with respect to the American posse pursuit, which fails to really keep the audience engaged, or build up the relentlessness of the pursuers beyond exposition and a few distant shots. Stands in stark creative distinction from the conventional Westerns of the prior three decades, to its credit. (4/5)",

I wanted to like the film as I have recently been trying to explore the Western genre and this is considered one of the finest examples of the genre but I found that I was annoyed by the self satisfied tone and the wooden performances. I was also disappointed by The Sting (1973), the other Robert Redford/Paul Newman/George Roy Hill collaboration, but because of the great reputation of this film I assumed that there would be more to enjoy but alas I was less than satisfied.\n\nCowboys and robbers Butch Cassidy, Paul Newman, and his friend the \"Sundance Kid\", Robert Redford, spend their time robbing banks and romancing schoolteacher Etta Place, Katharine Ross, with whom they both have a romantic relationship. They return to the \"Hole in the wall\" where they first established their gang but decide to escape to Bolivia. In order to do this they have to carry out several successful robberies and when they make a mistake they are tailed by the local law enforcement. They are able to evade them but their escape to Bolivia proves to be difficult as Sundance does not enjoy living there and tensions in their relationship grow. Robbing banks in Bolivia, they become successful and well known but when they discover that they are still being searched for they start to worry and Place leaves them to return to the United States. The two finally meet their assumed deaths in a shootout but go out victorious after affirming their loyalty to one another.\n\nOne of the major things that differentiated this film from so many other westerns was it's willingness to be anachronistic and include humorous lines that would not have been present in your average John Wayne vehicle. Legendary screenwriter William Goldman penned the screenplay and it is full of all of the knowing jokes that would have made clever 1969 people snigger but to me the film seemed a little too pleased with itself. We are introduced to the idea of the \u2018new world' through Cassidy and Place riding a bicycle around to the sounds of \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head.\" The sight of a cowboy on a bicycle is jarring and the very late 1960s music that accompanies the scene is not what you typically associate with the genre but the smugness with which Hill pores over his innovation ruins the moment. It would be nice if we were allowed to digest this clever provocation by ourselves instead of having the idea rammed down our throats. \n\nThe chemistry between Redford and Newman has been praised to no end as they can be considered the original \u2018bromance' but to me there was nothing particularly special there. The two have given brilliant performances as individuals in All Is Lost (2013) and The Verdict (1982) respectively but they are hardly Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton when brought together. Rounding out the cast was Ross who is the lady love of both men and has to walk the line between wild woman and cautious lover. She isn't completely convincing and this is partly because of how poorly her character was written as she has to be sexy and carefree but become a nagging shrew in the second act. The inclusion of a female character felt unnecessary because the focus of the film was the homoerotic relationship between the two men and having her between them, with her lack of character development, seemed like it took time away from what could have been a more interesting relationship.\n\nMy view of this film was negatively colored by the fact that I watched the far superior The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) on the same night which included and deconstructed all of the western tropes with far more style and elegance. Redford and Newman are both legends in their own right but this is hardly their best work and I appreciate the fact that this film was not able to beat Midnight Cowboy (1969) for Best Picture in 1969.",

The film was directed by George Roy Hill, who would later go on to direct such movies as The Sting. The film stars Robert Redford as The Sundance Kid and Paul Newman as Butch Cassid.\n\nThe story in my opinion was both enjoyable to watch unfold, and portrayed very well. \n\nThe acting was very strong especially Robert Redford as The Sundance Kid and Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy, personally I felt that they were the perfect fit for the characters, and I couldn't see anyone else playing them as well as they did.\n\nThe characters were also very strong especially Butch and The Sundance kid, I felt that they had good chemistry and worked off of each other really well.\n\nThe cinematography was also strong with some very interesting and well done shots of the characters and scenery.\n\nPersonally I really like the western setting with most films, and I'm glad to say that it works here. From the era to the people, the settings work really well especially for keeping the two main characters on there feet.\n\nThe set designs and props were done very well especially with the trains toward the beginning of the film.\n\nThe costumes and makeup like the sets were also done very well especially with the two main characters Butch and The Sundance Kid.\n\nThe film at points also had a very unique and good style, from the colour scheme to the cinematography.\n\nThe film also had some very strong practical effects especially with the gun fights and explosions.\n\nThe action like most westerns is very strong, from the cinematography to the really good tension.\n\nThe film also had some pretty good music here and there which for the most part fit with the film very well.\n\nThe comedy in the film was also very strong, and had me laughing out loud multiple times.\n\nThe film at points was also very atmospheric, especially the final scene with Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.\n\nThe film I also really enjoy and hope to watch again and again.\n\nOver all I give it a \n8/10\n85%\n4.25/5",

Hill directed Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid with an eye for unique shots. Every one of the film's wild shootouts is gripping to the last moment. His use of camera tricks, directorial angles, and sudden jump cuts is incredibly creative.\n\nGeorge Roy Hill is particularly brilliant for starting the film with a sepia toned suspense sequence with a card game with Sundance. Hill's choice immediately sucks you into the world of Western shootouts, card games, visiting brothels, and the high stakes game of bank robbing. The first fade in of color is as breathtaking as the horizon Butch Cassidy and Sundance ride towards. Hill also uses editors John C. Howard and Richard C. Meyer's quick cuts in his editing to make the audience jump like with Sundance's first quick draw of rapid firing bullets or the train explosions. I really like Hill's perspective behind the fence while Butch rides a bicycle so that the motion of his riding looks like a film reel. The sepia toned montage of pictures while the two bandits escape to Bolivia is very fun too. Hill just understands how to direct beautiful scenes and thrilling chase sequences.\n\nConrad Hall's cinematography is a stunning use of far wide shots for epic scale natural scenery. The dry desert and green valleys look phenomenal in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The extended chase sequence in the center of the film is gripping as you are constantly looking in the distance like the duo of robbers on the run for any sign of the law. Hall's viewpoint keeps you on edge at all times while Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid keep riding.\n\nThe soundtrack to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is classic tunes from 1969. They songs fit the film with an easy personality like a breeze of air grasping the characters as well as the atmosphere. The score from composer Burt Bacharach is charming or encompasses a chill vibe that keeps you either in still suspense or relaxed like the two at ease heroes.\n\nNotably, the supporting cast in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is impeccable. Katharine Ross is dreamy as Sundance's steadfast girlfriend Etta Place. Jeff Corey gets a shining moment when he scolds Butch and Sundance as Sheriff Bledsoe. Even a young Cloris Leachman makes an appearance as the sultry Agnes that makes out with Butch Cassidy. All in all, this is a prime example of a skilled supporting cast.\n\nLastly, Paul Newman and Robert Redford are indescribable as the leading men Butch Cassidy and Sundance, respectively. Newman is surprisingly hilarious as the charming intellectual Butch. Newman transforms William Goldman's witty script into verbal genius. Redford is really cool as the calm and calculating sharp shooter Sundance. Redford makes you believe he is a deadly sure shot with his intense eyes and lackadaisical attitude that exudes confidence. Together, their charisma and chemistry is palpable. Newman and Redford make this film a classic with realistic performances and endless charm. Butch Cassidy and Sundance are as cool as criminals have ever looked in cinema.\n\nCheck out this excellent Western crime thriller! The chase sequences and shootouts are worth the price of admission alone!",

Spoiled by digital filmmaking. But, wanting to be well versed in film, my journey takes me to them occasionally. Let me say I shouldn't always be so set in my ways. \n\nAbout 35 minutes in you are growing to like the characters played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford and you are hit with a highly formidable for that they can't escape from. They are being chased by the baddest lawmen money can buy. Those first thirty five minutes are admittedly the best of the movie, before it becomes an extended chase scene. The performances by the main cast are marvelous thought, throughout.\n\nAlot of money was spent to have the movie shot in real locations, and it shows. The landscapes are beautiful during the endless chase. The dialogue is witty. Maybe too witty for those in 1970, hoping to be whisked away to 1910. But both the modernization of dialogue and when screenwriters take it back (like Deadwood) are both valid ways to sell a movie set 100 years ago to a modern crowd. \nBurton Bacharach did the score too, so it doesn't strike you like a Leone western does, but feels more contemporary.",

Rather than going for a gritty tone in line with many other Westerns, William Goldman's script focuses on character interactions and a surprising amount of comedy between Cassidy and Sundance. The script and the direction George Roy Hill takes this story in manages to keep a mostly lighthearted tone while still reminding everyone that the two leads were criminals who made a living robbing trains and banks. What really sells this tone is the pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford as Cassidy and Sundance, who share impeccable chemistry and are the true life force of the film. Of course, the more familiar aspects of a Western are here as well: the sweeping cinematography of Conrad Hall beautifully captures the expanses of the Western U.S. and Bolivia (actually Mexico during filming), and the production design of each town and each interior feels authentic in a way they should. It begins to slog in the middle, as the film starts to lose some focus and jumps from scene to scene without proper transitions that make it feel natural, and the strange addition of montages with no dialogue (including one with just still frames) are oddly jarring and kill any pace the film may have set up. The Newman-Redford pairing truly makes up for all of these flaws though: their camaraderie alone is enough to make this one worth a watch.",

It's also too soft on many levels as well. OK classic, but it's not deserving it's place on the IMDB's top 250 list.\n\n7 out of 10 shootouts.",

I had just finished watching that special so I decided that I couldn't put off watching this film any longer. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is often called one of the best films by several critics around the world, and while I get what they see in it, I don't think it was nearly as good as I expected it to be. \n\nThe cinematography in this film was nothing short of brilliant. I loved each shot of the cavalry chasing after the gang all the way to Bolivia. You never really got to see who was apart of that charge which made the eventual moment when we discovered their identity rather underwhelming. The posse was presented as this mysterious force that the pair could not evade no matter where they attempted to hide, and little did I know that would make up the vast majority of the plot. There of course were moments at the beginning and end that I enjoyed, such as the \"knife or gun\" fight and the big shootout at the finale. There were several other moments though that didn't really help the plot along or even keep my interest which I really thought hurt the overall pacing and entertainment value of the film. The sepia tone moments were irritating as well. I definitely get what the idea was, I just didn't care for it. I will say though that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had a much more comedic vibe than I expected and the chemistry between Newman and Redford certainly made each scene that much better.\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is another classic film that I can now cross off the list. It was an above average film but certainly not worthy of the legendary status that is often bestowed upon it. Don't get me wrong, you'll have an enjoyable time watching it, I'd just advise you to slightly lower your expectations before you do.",

Not that I lived during them, not that I look back at the Vietnam War as if it were a good time in American history, not that I'm one of those young buffoons who blames their friendlessness on their possession of an old soul - I miss the late 1960s because of their filmmaking.  There was a feeling that anything was possible, that stars we got to know in the earlier years of the decade were suddenly drifting toward the game-changers rather than the drivel wholesome pieces, that Hollywood was suddenly a hip place instead of a soap scrubbed habitation.  How movies finally had something to say, whether it be artistically or socially.  It's exciting how we could have waltzed into the theater in 1960 to see a \"Pillow Talk\" 2.0, only to come back a few years later and find ourselves with \"Blowup\", \"Easy Rider\", or \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\". No decade has come close to the reinvention seen in the shape-shifting decade.\n\t\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" is one of the defining films of the time, among the series that entertained us with an easygoing, lo-fi atmosphere rather than a chintzy, big-budgeted one.  It's a reverse Western: everything looks as though it could be a part of a later-in-life John Wayne adventure, but the tone is less rugged, more self-deprecating.  It's a hybrid of different styles, some reminiscent of Robert Altman, others Robert Benton and Peter Bogdanovich.  Only slightly serious, with more than enough comic relief to call itself a - gulp - comedy, it's difficult to put a finger on what \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" really is.  Perhaps that was intentional, going out to be an undefinable western romp and coming back a champion.  But I suppose its breeziness is part of its charm.  Without a care in the world, the actions of the titular characters are unpredictable and wandering, as though it all were improvised.  So thank God Paul Newman and Robert Redford have enough charisma to keep us from snoozing as if we were being faced with a laborious spaghetti western.\n\tNewman is Butch Cassidy, Redford is the Sundance Kid; as the Old West's most formidable train robbers, they are said to be legends - just don't expect them to wear the term like a five-year-old dons a Superman cape.  They view their actions as time wasters, as a way to have some fun on a boring Sunday afternoon.  They don't like to kill.  They like the thrill that comes with running away from the law.  The danger is appealing. \n\tBut they've been doing the same thing for too long, and they're well aware they aren't going to live to be one-hundred, with so much flak behind their names.  They're going to be the victims of a shootout, maybe in a week, a month, a year.  So Butch Cassidy, or the Sundance Kid, I don't remember which, proposes they go down to Bolivia - there, they can refresh their thieving ways, and, eventually, live a normal life.  In tow is the Sundance Kid's girl, Etta (Katharine Ross), and for the first few months, things are blissful, successful.  But when an old enemy makes his way into the area, they realize that escaping from past wrongdoings may only be a temporary solution.\n\tWhen \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" isn't making us laugh, it moves by slowly; because it doesn't have the same mesmerizing quiet of other crime based dramas, like \"Thieves Like Us\" and \"The Thomas Crown Affair\", a moody setback does nothing besides pander by.  But when the film is good, it's great.  Newman and Redford have better chemistry than some of the most notable screen couples of the time, conversing with such witty ease that we can't help but want to be a part of their crime spree ourselves.   One of the best scenes in the film, which finds the duo at the edge of a cliff as the law chases them, is ecstatically funny, an inexperienced Redford complaining that he doesn't know how to swim, worried that he and his crime partner might have to jump.  Newman guffaws like an older brother, and, when they do go through with the deed, their rapport, especially as they go downstream, is delivered with effortless comedic energy.  Newman and Redford are fantastic together: as the quintessential everymen who happen to be movie stars, they seem destined to headline together.  How they only made one other film together (\"The Sting\") is mind-boggling - they put the B in bromance.  You can forget about Starsky and Hutch, Crockett and Tubbs; Newman and Redford are the real deal.\n\tBut \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" relies too much on the charisma of its stars.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering how excellent it is most of the time, but when it drags, it drags.  It's better off as a comedy, and when it decides to go for a serious moment, we're hardly convinced.  We want to have fun with our actors, not see them in crisis - the ending, all \"Bonnie and Clyde\" \"tragic\", doesn't fit.  We want more adventures.  If Clint Eastwood were starring, maybe we'd be okay seeing him go.  It would be heroic.  But Newman and Redford are much too likable to be too-serious-for-their-own-good anti-heroes, and we don't want to see their brotherly love come to an end.",

            "content": "This film starts off very well and has a good and cute little introduction to our characters with font that would look like the basis of what would be standard for Sony Vegas. This is a very iconic, influential film and is a fondly remembered classic Western, if they gave Best Picture based on what remained fondly remembered, this would win, but I thought 'Midnight Cowboy' was excellent, and, hey, at least they both won for Writing. It was surprising to find out that such a romantic and classic song, 'Raindrops keep Fallin' on my Head' came from a film like this and he should have been more careful on that bike! The story is the basis for what would inspire the modern action story as it is tight and thoroughly watchable. The film has a great style and looks absolutely wonderful, early on in the film everything has a gold tint to it and is very unique; I also expected Kid to be shot when he was accused of cheating. The film has an absolutely grand feel that has some absolutely beautiful shots; it also stages the action well and has a fantastically original, memorable and catchy soundtrack. The film also has a great sense of humour, a scene in particular about Kid saying he isn't picky and then goes on to demonstrate how picky he was, was just a nice little way of putting humour in there, although it ended strangely. There was also a point where Kid says, 'I'm better when I move', I expected Butch to say, 'I can see that'. There was a part with a huge explosion after using too much dynamite that should have killed them because of the spirit the film has and how much fun you're having, it doesn't matter. \n\nThe acting is naturally great and the pairing of Newman and Redford is legendary. These two would go on to work with George Roy Hill a few years later as well, to huge success, even bigger than this! Funny how the one that is most remembered out of the two didn't win Best Picture, but, hey, neither got Best Sound! It made me laugh that Butch said it was his gang, poor Kid. Speaking of which, Harvey looked like Josh Brolin and Woodcock reminded me of Kevin Spacey whilst being the kind of character that he would play as well, but even if there was a remake, which hopefully won't happen, no way would either of those do such small parts. It is also the big screen debut of Sam Elliott! It made me laugh that there as a 'Cassidy' involved with production of this film and that person was Harvey, funnily enough. When they rob another train and the authorities finally decide to do something about it, with our characters just standing and watching, I don't think the intrigue of that went anywhere. There is certainly something very ominous about watching torches just continually following you throughout the night as well as the fact that they're always on the horizon just consistently on your tail. Even if you do have to wonder if they would continue to follow for so long but I'm surprised that the authorities never saw them, even once, as it did seem at some points that they were very close. There was a part with a very loud gunshot that Kid fires where, just from looking at their face, it looks like it spells doom; I even wondered at some point if the people following them was their own gang, or, whatever was left of it. I know we see the authorities coming from the train at the start to chase after them but you never know what might have happened, maybe that would be a plot point in a remake and it would give Harvey something big to do and they seemed to have found that person they tied up pretty quickly. I'm also surprised that the conductors of the trains just let them rob it with little to no resistance; you could argue that the gang had weapons, but still, it seemed odd. There's also a shot from someone's perspective on top of a cliff with a shotgun near the start of the film and I thought they were going to start to open fire on Cassidy and Kid. \n\nDespite the fact that William Goldman is an excellent writer, who would go on to work with Redford again in another Oscar winning screenplay, especially with this as it is an original screenplay, as you would probably expect this to be based on a book of these characters or something, the things I didn't like all that much are parts of the script, some of the dialogue felt a little stiff and out of place, mostly by what Butch says, coupled with the fact that Kid didn't talk all that much. The way that he said 'they're getting on my nerves' or 'who are those guys' or how they both say 'no fooling' right after one another or that a character stops, when he is being chased, just to make a witty quip just seemed odd when they were spoken by the actors. I know the film is based on real exploits but I find it very stupid of the characters that have just relocated to a new area to escape the law; I might add, go and rob a bank the very next day. It wasn't even like they were hiding it either; they go to a restaurant in the evening and recite the language of the phrases they need to know and nobody caught onto that fact? Especially after the fact that there are wanted posters posted around anyway. \n\nI also didn't really feel that the characters liked each other all that much or were all that developed. We do learn things about our characters right up until the very end, even with a very critical thing you would have expected Butch to already tell Kid before this situation in the last reel. Kid tells Butch to shut up, because telling the brains to shut up makes sense. Butch remarks at one point about being a hero, which is odd seeing as how the scene before involved him robbing a bank. Throughout the film they are very clearly being hunted to be killed, not to be put in jail but one of them still remarks that if they give themselves up they might just get jail time, really? Earlier on Butch says he is going to jump in a river, he later says that the fall would kill them and then they both go to jump anyway, because that makes sense? It also seemed odd how Kid understood the foreign language well but wasn't the one to speak it himself. There is also a very odd bed scene where it looks like Kid is forcing someone he doesn't know into doing something she doesn't want to do but then it's revealed that they're together, but that relationship was weird because she was spending time with Butch as well. There was one point where it looked like he was pretending to reach for his gun when Kid says, 'take her', but even with that it is terrible because he clearly isn't too bothered about her. I know Kid was needed for lookout but I do find it odd how Kid was on watch in the very same room that Butch was trying to be with a girl, in. \n\nWhile the editing of the film is good, there is a picture montage of their trip to where they are going in the film and it goes on too long to the point where it overstays its welcome and we get the point. It goes on so long you'd expect them to just film it and splice clips together, but, hey, it's cheaper to a montage as well and it wasn't all bad. There was a point where they go to find proper jobs, which is about time, and I thought it was funny that they were standing so far away from the table; I thought they would just be right in front of it. I bring that up because later on here is a gun fight and they don't get hit, of course but before that, there is a shoot out that goes very loud all of a sudden and then quiet and all the while has someone screaming 'no' in the background and it seemed odd. \n\nThey should have run out the back at the end and that immediate look of horror that Butch shows is excellent and ends it well. I read that they ran off into the sunset whilst being shot and killed but the way this ends is great, fits the excellent style and somewhat leaves it open, to spare us from what is happening as well. I really did enjoy the film, but like usual, if I have issues I will focus on those more just to get my point across instead of just repeating what has already been said but I really did enjoy this film a lot. It has a solid story, good acting and is a fun film to watch that was excellently crafted and remains a classic for good reason.",

Give me a break that they had no other option to go \"straight\" and that they only murdered ppl when they played by the law.

            "content": "This is sort of a biopic about the late days of Butch and Sundance. I find it really interesting that they made the choice to focus the film on the later days of their lives, because when you think of Butch and Sundance you naturally suspect a classic old Western, but they deliver something a bit different from that. Although not from the beginning because the opening scenes are more of that classic Western style, with a bit of a comedic twist, and I love them. Most notable are the entertaining moments when Butch and Sundance are actually robbing a couple of trains as the nicest thieves ever. Then there's the entire center section of this film. I deeply disliked this section. From the moment Butch shows up with a bicycle and \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\" starts to play, the movie goes completely off the rails. This scene leads into a half-hour long (or more) chase scene where the boys ride horses for a while and look over their shoulder, then they ride horses some more and look over their shoulder, then they ride horses some more... You get the idea. I recognize the value of starting this chase, it is vital to the story, but it is dragged out so long the plot of the movie comes to a crashing halt.\n\nWhen the boys get to Bolivia I find that the movie starts to pick up again. From their early attempts at robbery in a foreign country, all the way to their attempt to go straight I was completely engaged again. The final scene of the film is perfectly crafted and fits exactly the style of the movie up to that point (some humor despite all the serious events.) Robert Redford and Paul Newman are superb in the lead roles. Their banter back and forth with one another is what makes the movie special. I never expected so many laughs watching a story like this, especially since I knew the end, but it delivers them anyways. I'm not sure how valuable Katharine Ross' character was to the plot. They seemed to imply there would be this love triangle forming between the 3, but not much comes of that. I could easily see myself completely forgetting her character altogether when I look back at this film, and that's OK because she's just extra baggage. Taken as a whole I think this movie is successful, I just wish there was a way I could shorten that center section. In fact if I ever watch it again I'll probably fast-forward through it, I was genuinely that bored/frustrated by it.",

            "content": "The western genre unfortunately is a vanishing art form whose abundance in the 1950's and 1960's, has now been replaced by the new oversaturation of superhero hero films. Truly is there is one genre that will be synonymous with the early 2000's, it will indeed be the comic book genre. Many genres were able to survive the turn of the century including drama, comedy, action adventure, hell even the traditional musical has been reborn, yet the once prevailing western is nearly extinct now; why is that? Some may argue their inherent cheesiness is the culprit, others point to low box office returns for the genre; whatever the reason, there are simply not many nowadays. That sad truth is all the more grueling when recollecting on 1969's, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid which is a classic example of a traditional adventure that is lacking in many so called adventure films of the current era. The two main protagonists are both badass and lovably endearing, both qualities audiences tend to gravitate towards and generally love. I myself found both characters unapologetically nonchalant and admirable in how they refuse to conform into societies set roles for them which a bold decision in both men's parts. Undeniably both outlaws are prime examples of what it means to be an outlaw as well as a westerner. That in mind adapting these two to the silver screen appeared to be a daunting task to any filmmaker, yet in the more than capable hands of director George Ray Hill this is a complete non-issue. Hill took a humongous risk in editing a significant amount of his film with comedic montages such as the famous bike ride with Etta and Butch, while B.J.Thomas's, Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head plays in the background; among several other chase sequences with \"hokey music playing in the background'. Yet the risk paid off, in my opinion, due to inherent flamboyancy of the two characters themselves, Butch more so. Because Butch and Sundance rob trains there is bound to be dynamite involved and oh boy does Hill know how to direct, not only explosions with style, but nearly every scene in the film. The Dull dreariness of the western front is instead, replaced with stylish jump cuts, unconventional editing and most importantly originality. Without the obligatory colt revolvers, cowboy hats and cacti, one would never presume this would be the visual style of a western. Overall the incredible risk of Hill's directing made the film better as a result superb directing. A hasty screenplay results in a constant pace and interesting turns in the story, a great screenplay as well. Finally the duo of Paul Newman and Robert Redford are quite simply spectacular, definitely one of the best buddy pairings of all time. Both play off of both the characters and the actor's strengths and weaknesses for both bring something incredibly different to the pairing, Redford nonchalant badassery and Newman irresistible Sauv\u00e9. Wither it be there performances or generally charisma both actors are excellent. Every time I see films like The Good the Bad and the Ugly or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid I am consistently reminded of the brilliance of the western genre. Upon great scrutiny I have come to the realization that the reason genre is dead is that very few directors contain the skill to pull off a great western, a quality that certainly holds true for Hill's, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.",

They have awesome chemistry and I love their characters and how they interact and feed off of each other.   I like the subtle but effective way this movie is shot.  The beginning is sepia-tone with no wide establishing shots but lots of close-ups.  And then we have the obligatory lovely landscapes of a western. All the close-ups and quick cuts and stylization are a bit unusual for a movie from this time, so good for them. I dig it. I like the theme of the inevitability of the future symbolized by the bicycle fad and unstoppable almost supernatural super posse. Not an amazing movie, but still really awesome.

            "content": "PART OF MY CLASSIC VIEWINGS OF 2014 LIST\r\n\r\n\"Lets you and me jump in that river.\"\r\n\r\nIt's the year 1969 and Hollywood, like the rest of America, is in a period of social change, particularly the hippie culture, and in the case of film, the formation of the MPAA rating system, where filmmakers can be more expressive in making their ideal film without being censored by the Hay's Code. And that leads us to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a film directed by George Roy Hill, who's intention was to create a western to change all westerns. And while it was a massive success in 1969 and still has a huge fanbase today, but I found this film to be massively disappointing for all its hype.\r\n\r\nPaul Newman and Robert Redford star as two notorious outlaws, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, who lead The Hole-in-the-Wall gang, and are constantly robbing trains during a time of social change. When the posse is closing in on them, the two outlaws, along with the lovely schoolteacher Etta (Katherine Ross), love interest of Sundance, head off to Bolivia to hit the banks... but as they rob more and there's more soldiers after them, they know that their luck is starting to run out.\r\n\r\nGetting my positives out of the way, the cinematography is excellent. I was impressed with the film's location shots and its unique camera angles. There were some smart decisions on the directors part in filming it. The film opens up with a \"silent\" movie about Butch and the gang ripping off trains, and then shows him and Sundance in a memorable duel scene in b&w, then transitions to color afterwards. Makes me wish that the rest of the movie is as impressive as its cinematography.\r\n\r\nAs for the actual film, as it was starting up, I was expecting this to be a western masterpiece, with the said opening scenes in all. I was entertained by some of the earliest action sequences, especially some of the train heist scenes and I was impressed by the tensions of Butch and Sundance's weakening power. There was also some fun little comedic sequences in these scenes, especially in the most famous moment in the film where the two jump off a cliff to avoid getting caught. But once the characters head to Bolivia, the film goes downhill really quickly. It doesn't help that the transition to Bolivia is this overlong postcard montage of the characters traveling to get there that lasts far too long. They could have put an intermission in there to make the film better. That scene really weakens the film. But what follows afterwards is far worse than the scene I just mentioned. After that overlong montage, the action sequences start to get tiresome and repetitive, there's hardly any suspense as in the great first half, and the most disappointing moment in the film is definitely the final act, during Butch and Sundance's last stand. As I said, the action got repetitive that I didn't care anymore about the film and just as the scene was getting really exciting... it ends, just like that. What annoys me about this is that the Hay's Code had been gone for a couple of years, so it was no excuse for them to create a grand sendoff for Butch and Sundance, but no, they ended like the Hay's Code was still in existence. Apparently Bonnie and Clyde got away with a extremely violent ending for its time (which that's a film I intend to see this year), so it was no excuse for George Roy Hill to do something like it in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\r\n\r\nWhile the film mostly disappointed me in terms of tense plotting and action, the stars, thankfully did not. Paul Newman and Robert Redford do excellent jobs at playing these notorious outlaws. You can tell they had fun in their roles and that's what makes them great in the film. Plus they had so many great comedic moments throughout, even in some of the boring moments in Bolivia. The only reason why I decided to stay and finish the film was because of Newman and Redford. They still entertained even when the actual film was not. I also give Katherine Ross credit for being the only main female actress in the film. While this was Newman and Redford's film for sure, she did a fine job at playing the love interest for Sundance.\r\n\r\nThe film is also known for its \"iconic\" score by Burt Bacharach. Even though its score won an Oscar, I hated it. It's one of the worst music scores I've heard in my life. Why? Well, if you want to make a western, I'd like to hear music that sounds like it came from a western, not a hippie movie. And that's what the score sounds like... hippie music... in a western!!!! A montage of Butch and Sundance robbing banks in Bolivia got ruined by this atrocious score, featuring some very annoying 60's style singing, that really made the film dull like the sequences itself. I give it credit for the song \"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head\", which is a great song, especially with it being something you don't expect in a western, but as for the actual score, it's a massive misfire for something considered \"iconic.\"\r\n\r\nI was wanting more out of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, more like the acclaim it has, and while it had some entertaining moments, wondrous cinematography, and great performances from Paul Newman and Robert Redford, the film is boring (once they get to Bolivia), tiresome, and anticlimactic for something considered groundbreaking. I might have enjoyed it more had I lived in the 60's but, this film is truly dated. If you're still shocked by my rating for this \"classic\", here's a link to Roger Ebert's review for this film, as his criticisms are similar to mine:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/butch-cassidy-and-the-sundance-kid-1969",

No, not The Man With No Name. These Wild West outlaws don't take themselves seriously enough to fit in the same category as the Spaghetti Western types. These two are swashbucklers. Regardless of whom the people were in real life, Paul Newman as Butch and Robert Redford as Sundance must be one of my favourite on-camera duos. Butch makes the rules and breaks them all the same, and shoots with his words far more than his bullets. Sundance fortifies his macho exterior so that only those that he loves would dare see his mooshy side. Neither of them give a hoot about anything, besides unnecessarily killing innocent lives. Saying that might hint that screenwriter William Goldman wanted to portray the two as anti-heroes. I would agree, but this isn't a case of the director, George Roy Hill, glamourizing the Wild West culture. One scene that clarifies the truth about Butch and Sundance is when the two are trying to compromise with a bribed sheriff, pleading to start clean. The sheriff refuses because, for criminals with such a legendary history, there is no way to start clean. And just like Butch and Sundance, we quickly look past that because there's just too much fun to be had in all of the commotion of bank robberies, high-speed chases, and few, but fantastic, shootouts. The lack of action may actually be a great strength of the movie, never bogged down by repetition. The \"villains\" (with respect to Butch and Sundance) never appear face-front or speak on screen, while the romantic interest Etta (Katharine Ross), a schoolteacher bored of her village life, stands out as a self-motivated accomplice. There are a couple of scenes where the movie wants to feel old-timey, by means of a silent film, still photos for a montage, and an entire scene in sepia tone. And, most importantly, the story progresses through humour. When it feels like our heroes are about to be wooped, PUNCHLINE. The movie ends on a punchline! And this is still based almost entirely on the true story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. However much needed to be tweaked, the tale of the two outlaws is both exhilarating and hilarious, and the small touches I mentioned add a unique charm.\n\n[If you do read my reviews, understand that I'm not trying to articulate perfectly. I write these as personal reference, in case I need to remember what I liked or disliked about a movie. I didn't dislike anything about this one.]",

            "content": "The thing that elevates Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid above lthe average western is the way the atmosphere is light. \nDespite featuring a rough plotline with the dramatics of western robbers, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance makes use of a light comedic tone to keep it consistently entertaining and even some romantic comedy in there to ensure it appeals to a wide audience.\nBut what makes Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid iconic is its relation to the 1960's counterculture movement. As a film romanticising crime in a similar manner to the recently released Bonnie and Clyde which also chronicled a pair of bank robbers, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid plays its villainous protagonists out in such a manner that they are nothing if not likeable. They're a charming pair of buddies who share fine chemistry thanks to the work it its two lead actors, and they really give perspective into the counterculture side of things which makes it a powerful film.\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is truly one of the greatest westerns I've ever seen, and although it keeps up with many of the traditional western film qualities, it increases the pacing slightly, lightens the tone so its less gritty and more romanticised for the style, and tones up the quality of the shootouts which result in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid being a fairly energetic and stylistic western.\nThe screenplay to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is very clever and delves beneath the surface of its characters well, making the charming and heroic despite being bank robbers. It's also full of sophisticated charm and wit which enhances the characters by making them all the more likeable without burdening them with silly dynamics which would damage the seriousness of the story.\nPlus, the structure and style of the story is great in how it sets the story up, and later how it brings it to a close in an iconic manner with a befitting honour for the strong characters of the story.\n And Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is unforgettable because of the actors cast in the titular roles. The duo of Academy Award winners Paul Newman and Robert Redford who also starred in the Best Picture Winning classic The Sting are reunited to kick some ass in this western, and they deliver on that promise. They portray Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid respectively in a sophisticated and respectable manner, without missing a beat of wit and charm with their chemistry and delivery of script lines which makes Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid a riot from start to finish with strong lead characters.\nKatharine Ross also gives her finest performance since her Academy Award nominated role in 1967's The Graduate with her portrayal of Etta Place being a strong one, and her chemistry with Paul Newman is impeccable. She really brings the sweetness of the story out and makes the romantic theme a good addition to the film.\n\nFrankly, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is easier to watch than many other westerns because of its light atmosphere, and its pacing is constantly more stimulating due to its clever script and entertaining action. It's a western masterpiece.",

They pulled jobs on banks and trains with an expertise that made them famous from coast to coast.\r\n\r\nNow, years after being out of the business for about two decades, they decide to pull one last bank heist in Bolivia, with the help of a school teacher (Katharine Ross) with romantic ties to both men.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I am pretty disappointed in this film. I found it to be slow, with not enough action considering the topic of the movie. It dragged so much that I noticed spending more attention to my computer than watching the movie itself on cable television.\r\n\r\nOne thing that stood out was the on-screen relationship between Newman and Redford. This is what carries the movie I believe, and most likely why this movie is called a classic now. You feel as if the two are not just partners in crime, but friends with the ribbing that they give one another.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with this movie is the soundtrack. The only piece of music that is memorable is Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head by BJ Thomas, and that was a weird tune for a Western set in the Old West. If you ask me, the song was just an odd choice.\r\n\r\nI also barely enjoyed Ross as \"Etta Place\". Her character was barely developed if you asked me. It appeared that she was there as a romantic interest, and to help teach \"Butch\" and \"Sundance\" Spanish for their attempt at robbing the Bolivian bank.\r\n\r\nIf you expect a lot of gunfights, you are mistaken on this one. Of what there is in the movie, they are short and well placed.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is hard for me to judge since Encore Westerns used a pan-and-scan format. I had to deal with only half of a scene when two people were talking to one another. But, from wide shots, I could see some spectacular scenery, including the famous scene when the title characters jump from a cliff into the water.\r\n\r\nBecause it was declared a classic, I've been wanting to see this movie. I am highly disappointed in it.",

What Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid never fails to lose sight of is a sense of fun; even when the situation is at its bleakest, there still is a joke cracked to break the tension.  The only thing I felt was a negative here is an absence of a great score, or really much of a score all together; there are maybe three to four songs here, and perhaps I have been spoiled by Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone, but I feel that a great soundtrack in a Western is imperatively essential to tie everything together in one, complete package.

First of all, couldn't anyone just decide if they want to do a buddy movie or a serious western drama? The overall tone and atmosphere changes throughout the film and certainly hurts the dramatic effect of the story. Actually, it was pretty much the same with their later film The Sting which I very much enjoyed, the subject matter in Butch Cassidy would have deserved a more earnest approach in my opinion.\n\nAn even bigger enigma than the constant change of tone was the turn of Etta Place, the girlfriend of Sundance Kid, from school teacher to bank robber without any training, motives or explanation. Beside the fact, that she doesn't have much screentime I couldn't really comprehend what made her a criminal.\nI also didn't really get why they didn't stick with the \"straight\" work after successfully finishing their first job - it can't be too dangerous, they returned to bank robbing after all.\n\nHow this script could have won Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards is beyond my understanding.

Instead of the duels and show downs we have a score of 'raindrops are 'falling on my head', at the time i think the audience found this bizare because of the usual grity western but when we look back now this song optimizes Butch and Sundance.\nThe script is beautiful written a line is not wasted, where some films you want them to shut up, this one you want to hear more.\nButch and Sundance where the biggest outlaws of their time and i can't really say whether the film is historically correct but the ending is rather a dissapointment.\nsurrounded by Bolivian army they suicide into their ammunition.\nOverall the film is a western showing a historic side of America and i particularly loved Robert Redfords performance as Sundance kid and is one of the greatest and admirable character's i have ever seen and Brad Pitt resembles him a lot.",

The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang became infamous for their exploits with Butch (Newman) being the brains and Sundance (Redford) the fastest gun around. Together these two robbed banks, held up trains, and all the while had a good time. At one point or another the law was after them so they fled to South America with one of Butch's nefarious schemes in mind. However, it was not what they expected and they had to face their biggest challenge ever. With the odds against them, they went out fighting and the legend of Butch Cassidy and Sundance was forever solidified. This film is as much a lighthearted comedy as it is a western. Newman and Redford have hilarious dialogue that brings the film alive and you end up rooting for these two anti-heroes. Although it is a seemingly random addition the song \"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head\" is an added bonus.",

Newman and Redford are great as the inseparable pair of thieves and play their parts very well in a true story about the infamous gang in the old west. What gives the film flare are the performances and the style brought about by Goldman's witty writing and Conrad Hall's sensational cinematography. Definitely a \"cult\" favorite I think that has influenced directors and filmmakers like the Coen Brothers and Tarantino for sure. Not my favorite western by a long shot but the film has fun in reliving the triumphs of these two outlaws and their drive to the end.",

If it's a character study of a couple of outlaws in the dwindling days of the old west, he didn't give us enough insight into the characters. If it's a comic retelling of the outlaws last days, it is too long and drawn out by cinematic landscapes and stills of parties on ships. If it is an action movie, it fails miserably.

So I had no idea what to expect when popping Butch in the DVD player. Whatever tentative expectation-suggestions I had, they certainly wouldn't really have prepared me for the tonally, thematically, and anachronistically bizarre music choices as they played over montages of bike-riding, New York-ing it up, bank robberies, and horse chases. Redford and Newman were really fun as the two leads, although Redford's character veered from wonderfully deadpan to needlessly cruel (pretty much always to his girlfriend, played by Katharine Ross), and the humour was well-done, for the most part. The train robbery and escape were the most entertaining in terms of comedy and pacing, while the end kind of lost its way as it dragged on, but I'm glad I saw it. Sure puts a lot of Blazing Saddles into perspective.\n\nIn short, I agree with a lot of what the Times review had to say. The movie did not seem to know what it wanted to be, and I would have been much happier with a full length farce than the drama-coma-wtf that we got, but it's always fascinating to watch this kind of cultural history for the first time.",

They were so removed from their roles I wondered if they just saw the screenplay the night before and did the whole thing in one take.  Had I not seen Newman in far better roles, I'd have dismissed him as an actor on par with Madonna and William Shatner.\n\nThe legendary William Goldman script is so slack.  The movie ambles for 40 minutes with no point for its characters until finally Butch and Sundance are on the run from the UP posse.\n\nI never saw this at the time, although I did see their follow-up \"The Sting\" and totally enjoyed it then.

But while the film as a whole is wonderfully entertaining, it does have its problems. As much as I like the score, it doesn't work. In fact, it practically ruins several great scenes, with the \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\" sequence and the photo montage near the middle being two prime examples.

The story is great, and as I said earlier, the action is pretty much solid the whole way through. The major thing that stands out in this film though is the writing, which is really funny, and equally dramatic and overall awesome. It touches on every note really, really well. The climax is really well done as far as Westerns go. If I have a complaint though, it has to be this one scene in which Butch is riding a bicycle with Kid's girlfriend, where they play a more modern song, which breaks the mood of where and when the film takes place. It by no means ruins the film, but it is an annoying scene as it goes on. The script, lead acting, pacing, direction, and climax are fantastic, and makes for a film I'd be willing to watch many more times.",

Now Paul Newman is hands down one of the coolest people ever to walk the earth, and Robert Redford is right up there with him. Redford's Sundance Kid ranks among my Top 5 favorite performances of all time, and its towards the top of that small list. These two have a connection that is hard to find on screen, these two are true friends, and that relationship shows on screen. This is a movie that makes me want to go out and make movies, it is one of those movies that drove my interest in film. I think it is impossible to have more fun watching a film then you do watching Butch Cassidy. This movie introduced the world to Robert Redford, and the iconic pairing of himself and Paul Newman.

It shows the three most recent user reviews for that particular picture. At this moment, I'd like to share the kind of unfortunate crap that people think about movies:\r\n\r\n\"Watch it, that is all.\"\r\n\"Probably the first of the westerns with slapstick humor\"\r\n\"One of the best Westerns ever made, Paul Newman and Robert Redford make one of the best pairings in cinema history.\"\r\n\r\n...what?\r\n\r\nI honestly want to see a list of the pictures these people have seen that they would consider \"Western.\" BUTCH is about as much of a Western as NO COUNTRY. It's an hommage from a much different time. BUTCH is what happens if you take a bunch of cocky youths out of their VW Rabbit, give them a joint, make them watch THE TIN STAR, and then hand them a camera.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this is precisely what makes BUTCH such an enduring picture. It preserves both a tested cinematic format and the edginess of 1969. But is it deserving of the label \"[o]ne of the best Westerns ever made\"? No way. It is a shameless carbon-copy of BONNIE & CLYDE. The second half of the film is remarkably slow. And, those who have seen it will understand, it is too damn pretty.\r\n\r\nI will agree that Newman and Redford make an endearing couple. Redford's passion for cinema is tangible and Newman follows his impossibly charming lead. But there's something else. I never pick up on cinematic homoeroticism. But here? Even Little Ms. Robinson can't calm them down.\r\n\r\nThose who point to DAYS OF HEAVEN as some kind of cinematographic landmark need to take another look at BUTCH. The picture-taking is so underappreciated. Perhaps it is so because it is remarkably out of place. The camera is outrageously active. It plays around with weird and aimless focus lengths, puzzling apertures, and every zoom opportunity in sight. It doesn't fit. But that doesn't change the fact that some of the darkest, most dazzling photography of the second half of the century lies dormant in this picture.\r\n\r\nNone of my evaluation changes the fact that I watched this movie with my father. I remember him recommending it to me years ago and we finally looked at it last night. He saw it in on the big screen when it came out in '69 and there is no substitute for the joy a movie lover can feel when he or she enjoys their favorite hobby with someone so close and who shares the real connection we seek.",

            "content": "Ever since I first saw it as a child, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has always been one of my favorite movies. It was such a different take on the old west and life of an outlaw than I'd seen before, or that anyone had seen for that matter. More playful than even John Ford's most light hearted works, but without the sappiness of the old singing cowboy comedies, it made the west seem like not only a grand adventure, but also great fun. With its oddball sense of humor and the interplay between its two stars, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is both a great western and perhaps the best buddy comedy Hollywood ever made.\n\t\nAs the title suggests, the film follows the exploits of two of the Wild West's most infamous outlaws, who with their Hole in the Wall Gang robbed banks and trains far and wide, earning themselves a reputation as some of the move dangerous men alive. But you'd never know it if you met them. Far from hardened outlaws, Butch and Sundance are friendly, laid back cutups who find enjoyment where they can and never take life too seriously. Charming to a fault, they're even nice to the people they're robbing. They're not really bad men you see; they just have expensive tastes and a strong aversion to hard work.\n\t\nWhether it's a narrow getaway, a stick up, or a friendly visit to the nearest brothel, everything they touch becomes good natured fun, and it all works because of the men playing them. Hiring Paul Newman and then newcomer Robert Redford as Butch and Sundance was one the great happy coincidences in Hollywood history, like casting Ingrid Bergman opposite Humphrey Bogart, and began an on screen partnership even more enduring. The chemistry between these men is incredible; even knowing this was their first film together it's hard to believe they hadn't known each other all their lives.\n\t\nOn their own each man has exceptional wit and charisma. Together they're the perfect comedic duo; Butch the talkative joker, Sundance the tight lipped strait man. Never overplaying their shtick, they always lay on just the right amount of humor. When times are good they're like a pair of schoolboys playing hooky. When times are bad they're worse than an old married couple. \n\t\nOf course not all the credit goes to the actors. The director and the screenplay are crucial to the film's ability to keep its cheery tone. Even when Butch and Sundance are running for their lives, hounded by the best lawmen and trackers in the west, it's no reason for things to get serious. Now they're just a couple of saps who can't catch a break, leading them to a harebrained stunt that remains one of the screen's great moments of physical comedy. \n\t\nMuch of the film's humor and charm come from its dialogue, yet at times it accomplishes a great amount with no words at all. The New York montage condenses the story of their fun in the big city and their departure for South America into a few brief moments, the series of black and white stills and old timey waltzes and carnival music wonderfully evocative of the period. An entire string of Bolivian robberies likewise becomes a cheerful musical interlude.\n\t\nAnd speaking of musical interludes, the whole movie is so carefree and delightfully screwball that it even manages to make the dreaded Semi-Obligatory Lyrical Interlude- in which lover's engage in pleasant activities that have nothing to do with the plot- work. Rationally there's no reason why a scene of Paul Newman riding a bicycle with a woman we've just met should follow a train robbery, but here it's so charming that we either forget that or just don't car. There's simply something magical about watching Newman and Katherine Ross peddling around that meadow, and his wordless 'daredevil' scene is the best thing since Buster Keaton.\n\t\nYet the good times can't last forever, certainly not for men in their line of work. The fact is that the world they know is passing away. The Wild West isn't as wild as it used to be, and their profession is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. They realize this and go halfway around the world to a place that's still wild and lawless in an attempt to forestall it. It works for a while, but it's only so long before their past starts to catch up with them. In the blink of an eye things turn deadly serious, and we realize that the world's closing in on them and they can't escape it, no matter how far they go. In the end Butch and Sundance died as they lived; on their own terms, as outlaws, and following no-one's rules but their own.",

The use of the silent movie intro and final imprinting of the duo on the screen as they meet their demise help to give the movie a surreal feeling.  This film was good, but it could have been great if Hill would have chosen a mood and stuck with it throughout the film.  Nevertheless, Newman and Redford (and Katherine Ross as well, though in a much more supporting role) shine in a fun experience that has aged quite well for a movie from 1969.",

In retrospect I'm almost glad I didn't, because the themes and subtletry of the story would have probably been lost on me as a child.  Watching it now, however, I can see that it is one of the finest westerns ever shot, despite being a bit fragmented and jumpy in its plot.\r\n\r\nThe movie is almost a scene-by-scene change of mood and story, but this is often the case in a historic movie which tries to document almost mythical figures.  Where the movie succeeds, however, is focusing on the later part of the outlaw's careers, where they can just start to see fate and karma catching up with them.  This is beautifully represented at the real turning point in the story, where the \"heroes\" find themselves on the run.  I particularly loved this part of the film because I was subtly and unknowingly put in a position where the movie completely changes tone, from light and airy to suddenly serious, the same way the characters are feeling in the movie, and I didn't need a sudden bus of dramatic scoring to tell me it happened.  In fact, the pure simplicity of the posse chase phase of the movie is what makes it great, along with the almost unearthly feel of their pursuers.\r\n\r\nI don't want to go too far into plot, so I'll talk for a moment about the photography, which is one of the best examples in a western movie, and if you think for a minute about what I just said, it was a pretty damn bold statement.  I've certainly seen films with some more grandiose landscapes, but the two things which cause me to make this assertion are the shots of the distant posse slowly gaining ground and the ability of camera focus to reveal things in the film we barely realized were in the background.  The visuals of the film are almost hypnotic at times.  Not to overlook the black and white footage as well as the still photographs which constantly play a huge role in movie.  I'm still not sure how they got that last shot from a closeup out to the panoramic view it was.\r\n\r\nThe acting was great as many people have already heard, and the actors are fueled by a good, sparse script which brings a whole lot of bittersweet laughs.  It's not exactly a classic western, but it accomplishes the western purpose, which is to explore moral dilemmas and challenges, especially those which are caused by a sudden, subtle change which throws a monkey wrench in the reality we've become accustomed to.  It could be something as amazing as an automobile, or even something as simple as a bicycle.",

It's a comedy as well as a western, with both extremely riveting thrill-scenes, and a splendidly written script which achieves good humour threw both clever dialogue and farce. The two men spend a good chunk of the film trying to escape from a seemingly superhuman tracker. When they stop to rest they look back and see a crowd of men in the distance with a mysterious figure who can track them over even solid rock. I like to think this aspect of it is symbolically emphasising what a character bellows at them earlier in the film, that the time of the outlaws is over and for Butch and the Kid it's just a matter of choosing where they're gunned down. It's not perfect, as to the very latter section of the film it seems to get a little too querky and cute, but the tremendous ending completely makes up for it and the film left me with a great respect for it.",

This is one of those stories when you have the same antagonist and protagonist, and you can't help but feel for those persons, despite them stealing banks, robbing trains, and shooting people. There's so much chemistry between Paul Newman and Robert Redford you couldn't believe these people are actually acting. They got so much absorbed by their roles and played them to perfection.  The silent introduction, the bicycle ride with raindrops falling on their heads, and the switch from USA to Bolivia scene are just stunning. \nThe film has a perfect running time, leading to a perfect finale you won't see coming.",

It's the kind of movie that could only have been made at exactly the time it came about. Paul Newman, one of the most likable people in cinema, plays another anti-hero two years after his career-defining turn in Cool Hand Luke. His casting along with Redford and the light tone of the film suggest very little in the way of moral ambiguity. We are supposed to like and sympathize with these people - and like them we do, at least Butch. Sundance, the pessimist, is a harder case but is necessary to the pairing.

The bike scene with Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head was too cheesy and didn't feel like it belonged. The third problem was the picture montage when the three of them are headed to Bolivia, it just felt lazy. The fourth problem I had with this movie is that the music they chose wasn't very good at all with the exception for the first scene. The final problem with the movie is that maybe it was too long because I started losing interest towards the end.

At one point or another the law was after them so they fled to South America with one of Butch's nefarious schemes in mind. However, it was not what they expected and they had to face their biggest challenge ever. With the odds against them, they went out fighting and the legend of Butch Cassidy and Sundance was forever solidified. This film is as much a lighthearted comedy as it is a western.

            "content": "For my 300th review I recently viewed the \"classic' film Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.  My recollection of this film was that it was very fresh, exciting, and cutting edge filmmaking.  Sadly, as is so often the case when something is a very much a product of it's time, it now seems trite, overblown and an experiment gone wrong.\r\n\r\nNot to say that Newman and Redford don't command your attention, but there is so much that went astray in this 70's retooling of the western genre (in truth, more of a buddy film if you ask me).  Starting with the music - I'm sure signing the then very hot Burt Bacharrach to write the soundtrack seemed like gold at the time, and yeah, it did produce a hit song (a hit song in a western???? Oh well, remember Rio Bravo had Ricky Nelson crooning and strumming guitar... at least that marginally fit the theme, while here, the canned popcorn sounds didn't resonate at all.  Frankly it got in the way of the film, as if saying, hey, listen up, I'm Burt Bacharrach and this is my groovy sound!).\r\n\r\nThe film starts off well enough, with the sepia toned intro moving into real life while still being sepia.  The color doesn't come in until the two stars are riding towards Hole In The Wall, giving the 60's viewer a wow moment of the red rock canyonlands.  Of course the print I was viewing must have been an old one, for the color was pretty washed out, sad to say. \r\n\r\nThe filming itself isn't bad, with some really nice use of shading, but there were many a script decision made that went sideways.  In trying to stay grounded in The Western, there were too many scenes of horses riding like hell - it made me wonder, seeing both heroes on the back of a single galloping horse - surely the poor horse couldn't keep going nearly as long as the film suggested.  Further there are the requisite \"shoot the bad guy and watch him fall off the roof\" kind of stuff - and then the film attempted to say something more meaningful by cranking up a guy's death scream, then doing a close up of his shot up body writhing in pain.  OK, nice attempt, but you can't have it both ways - fantasy and realism cannot truly coincide if you're attempting to make a worthwhile narrative.\r\n\r\nThe real topper though was in the middle of the film, which was running fairly well except for the overuse of the horse chases.  For whatever reason, the director decided to get all artsy again, showing a full 5 minutes of \"postcard\" pictures that conveniently had the stars front and center.  WTF?  A minute of this \"art\" would have been too much, so this went on waaaaay too long.\r\n\r\nIn the end what you get with this film is a look into the time in which it was filmed. It was the beginning of an era where boundaries in storytelling were being challenged.  Hooray for that, but now the film seems very rooted in those times and very dated.  I'm sure it was racy at the time to suggest that there may have been some hanky panky between the Katherine Ross, the female lead and both Newman and Redford - but it was couched in such a way as to be vague and non threatening to the conservative sensibilities. \r\n\r\nNewman and Redford hold this thing together, exhibiting an easy charm and chemistry and do the most difficult thing of all, seeming natural in a film that wasn't.  I've heard that a new film focusing on the Kid's later years (assuming that he somehow survived that final shootout)is in the works - it will be interesting to see how this film will be treated.",

Rather it's the opposite, it works perfectly. It's just not my cup of tea. Paul Newman and Robert Redford give superb performances in one of their collaborations. The story follows the legendary Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid on their adventures. They rob banks and trains, get chased by lawmen, and have the time of their lives. The characters themselves are what made the movie for me. The way Newman and Redford play off one another is fantastic. The soundtrack is, in my opinion, way out of place. The song \"Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head\" was made famous by this film, but I could see it used better in countless other films rather than this one. Overall it's a great dual character piece set in the west.",

Unfortunately, it begins to spiral down from there and no further scene in the film captures the spirit of that short burst of sepia-toned brilliance. For \"Butch Cassidy...\"is a more toned-down western, not dirty enough and too cutesy to really be classified in that genre. Although there is some great chemistry between the main leads, played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford, for the year in it was made it could have been far grittier and is spoiled in particular by the sparse, awkward placement of music, especially the incongruent tune of Burt Bacharach's \"Raindrops keep falling on my head\".",

First off, half the film doesn't take place in the American West, even though Bolivia does have a resemblance. Also, the screenplay has too many jokes, one-liners, and witty dialogue NOT to be called a comedy.\r\nEither way, here's a little description: Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) is the leader of a gang of Old West gang of bandits, which includes the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford), who is really his best friend. However, they are threatened by a group out to catch them because they have been involved in one too many train robberies with the wrong fellow. So, with Sundance's girl (Katharine Ross), they escape to the South American country of Bolivia.\r\nPersonally, I love this movie. It had me laughing and attentive throughout the whole film, quite an accomplishment. Also, Newman's and Redford's chemistry and interactions is so believable and funny, it makes me just want to watch their character talk to each other for two hours while I watch.\r\nA great cast and marvelous, Academy Award-winning screenplay makes a wonderful, must-see film.",

            "content": "You know, Butch and Sundance sounds like the stereotypical male/female role compensation in a gay couple, and it doesn't really help that this couple is Paul Newman and Robert Redford, because they're too pretty to be outlaws in the brutal west. Actually, Butch and Sundance weren't the worst-looking outlaws of the old west, but here, Butch had to go against the stereotype of his gay name and lose the moustache, because these guys look gay enough when it's just Sundance with the stache. Actually, I don't know if the moustache thing was all that big of a stereotype back in 1969, or at least it must not have been, because, as they tell you in the trailers, Butch and Sundance were trying to escape an ensuing modern world. I can't blame them, because, if you'll forgive my morbidity, in this modern world, Newman is dead, and the years have hit Redford like one of the trains he and his boyfriend knocked over back in the day. Speaking of which, if nothing else is exciting about this film, it's the fact that it was the first to feature the legendary duo of Paul Newman and Robert Redford... out of only two. They probably wouldn't have even made \"The Sting\" if George Roy Hill didn't drag them back together for that one, too, but I can't blame people for still finding their teamwork iconic, because they're mighty charming, even though they can't keep the film from being about as slow as a dyslexic stoner with cerebral palsy and polio, only, obviously, with a desire to avoid the noose. My horribly morbid jokes aside, the film is decent, but kept a ways away from being fun, and not just by the slow spells.\r\n\r\nAn adventurous account of two legendary men of crime, passion and charm, this film's story concept has a lot of potential for fun, but not much in the way of dramatic potential, at least not in this case, in which the story concept, with natural shortcomings, takes a lighthearted approach to potentially tense momentum that, for all the scope, limits a sense of urgency almost as much as tonal unevenness. Whether it be because the jars aren't too extreme, due to the narrative's rarely getting all that heavy, or because the cold atmosphere limits a sense of tone to begin with, tonal inconsistencies aren't too big of an issue, but the humor and seriousness of this crime thriller is juggled messily. Of course, even more all over the place is focus, because as much as I complain about natural shortcomings and a lack of a sense of urgency, there are still a lot of layers to this adventure, buddy romp, romantic triangle, and moderately dramatic thriller, and each shift between these layers is a serious jar, ostensibly because each layer is focused upon for way too long. Clocking in just shy of two hours, this film is dragged out by anything from excesses in the material that further exacerbate the sting of unevenness, to filler and long meditations on nothing which quickly become monotonous, but must not be present too much, given that a sense of pacing is tight in a lot of ways. I suppose scripting gets the film where it wants to go rather smoothly, and that's by some miracle, because, at the end of the day, the biggest problem with this film is George Ray Hill, whose extremely quiet directorial approach doesn't so much feel thoughtful, as much as it feels lazy, with a chilled, if at all existent atmosphere that, upon combining with the dragging, establishes an almost ethereal feel which limits resonance and bores, frequently, and sometimes tediously. I reckon endearing style, scripting and acting keep the final product adequately entertaining, but Hill very rarely abates on that dry storytelling that, plain and simple, is dull, seriously so, taking a conceptually thin, yet still worthy project that has the potential and, well, the material to thoroughly engage, maybe even reward, and violating it by draining a sense of fun, until the final product collapses as underwhelming. Nevertheless, beyond Hill's direction, as well as the natural shortcomings and inconsistencies, the film keeps the patient going just fine by doing a respectable deal of things right, including capturing an era in a handsome manner.\r\n\r\nSet largely on vacant soil beyond civilization, this film isn't especially playful or even unique with its production values, but Philip M. Jeffries' and Jack Martin Smith's art direction still does a perfectly fine job of restoring the look of an America preparing for the turn into the 20th century with a handsomeness deriving from the sheer distinctiveness of the environments, and complimented highly by cinematography by the great Conrad Hall that delivers on near-dreamily light coloring and a remarkable emphasis on subtle lighting in brighter settings, and on the lack of lighting in the darker settings in a fashion that was refreshing for the time and still stunning to this day. From the particularly unique 1890s photo-style sequences, or the many breathtaking shots of a classic western environment, the film's visual style is rich with highlights and ultimately just about truly amazing, with an edge that is more-or-less matched by the edge of certain areas in the film's story concept. This somewhat light take on the misadventures legendary outlaws might not have much in the way of dramatic edge, but it's still kind of refreshing in its being a little more adult than many 1960s Hollywood westerns, as surely as it, in its dynamicity as a comedy-drama interpretation of the legendary tale of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, is more intriguing than its interpretation, that is, its directorial interpretation. Well, William Goldman's script is still seriously draggy, the point of inconsistency, but it's still much more inspired than George Roy Hill's direction, with consistently clever dialogue that often anchors sharp humor, in addition to characterization that places just a flavorful punch of Hollywood fluff on the drawing of humanly genuine and subtly layered figures. The script is just about excellent, and the style isn't too shabby either, so, by a pretty embarrassing margin, limp direction on Hill's part is the final product's biggest issue, threatening engagement value which is adequately sustained by the sharp style, writing and, of course, acting. Driving the film as much as it can with all of the slow spells, this cast is rich with charm, partly from the beautiful Katharine Ross as an innocent woman who joins the run of two men she much choose between as lovers, and largely from dashing leads Paul Newman and Robert Redford, whose dynamite individual charisma is matched only by dynamite chemistry. Newman and Redford, like Williams, do more than a film this cold probably deserves, and were it not for Hill's falling so flat, the final product would have gone a long way, and yet, with that said, the film intrigues just fine with its fair deal of strengths, despite its many shortcomings.\r\n\r\nWhen the heat has blown over, natural shortcomings to this story concept are so intensely stressed by tonal and focal inconsistencies, structural dragging, and some seriously dull directorial cold spells hold the final product way back, but solid art direction, gorgeous cinematography, sharp writing and charismatic performances - particularly by Paul Newman and Robert Redford - ultimately proves to be enough to make George Roy Hill's \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" a fair, if cold tribute to one of the great team of outlaws of the old west.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

            "content": "Before teaming up together in the enormously successful Sting in the early '70s, cinematic superstars Paul Newman and Robert Redford paired up in 1969's near equally enormous Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a movie whose reputation over forty years has walked the line between Western classic and over-hyped big-budget buddy flick.\r\n\r\nCassidy and the Kid follows its two eponymous brigands, outlaws who have overstayed their welcome on a falling frontier, as the savage West is quickly becoming tame at the turn of the twentieth century.  After a routine train robbery goes south, so do Butch and Sundance, played by Newman and Redford respectively, once a posse threatens to end their criminal career... permanently.  Along with the courting companionship of an enigmatic schoolteacher - her only apparent purpose is to close a love triangle with the two main heroes, but the filmmakers dare not explain why - the Banditos Yanquis as they're swiftly coined set out to rob banks in Bolivia.  It's a tale worth telling, a solid plot for a film.\r\n\r\nWhat's divided critics from '69 'til now is the ultimate effectiveness of William Goldman's ambiguous screenplay.  From the outset, director George Roy Hill always intended for his film to be a blending of genres and moods, juggling sympathy with comical farce.  The first scene opens in classic spaghetti style, a drawn out showdown encapsulating the intensity of any Lee Van Cleef counterpart,  the sepia color tone emphasizing the olden photographic nature of the late 1800's.  It's an opening that you immediately relate to and understand... It's a Western. Then, a shift in mood. Butch and Sundance become established as long-time friends, nay, more appropriately, bumbling buddies that precede the cop duos of the 80's and onward.  Butch is the brains, and Sundance is the sick shooter, the man with a mouth and the guy with a gun.  So what starts as a serious film rapidly transitions into a buddy comedy, and there's nothing wrong with that.  It's perfectly representative of its characters, two Western veterans who can't keep up with the world that's changing around them and ultimately have to adapt to it.  The real problem with the film is that its ambiguity lies in the fact that it continually shifts back and forth between sobriety and daring delight.  It never really knows what it's trying to be.  But like I said before, that's what it was intended to be right? And like I said before, it all depends on whether you view this as strengthening the film via distinctiveness, or hindering it by never allowing it to become either the truly brilliant Western or comedy that it could have been.\r\n\r\nThat said, the sharp dialogue and delivery of Newman and Redford more than make up for any faults in the storytelling department, their bickering quips easily proving the highlight and foundation of Cassidy and the Kid.  No shocks required.  Though at the time Redford wasn't a superstar, in retrospect the match-up was fateful and the performances could hardly have been disastrous.  One notable sequence involves the two notorious bandits' difficulty in robbing Bolivian banks because they don't know the language.  Leave it to Paul Newman's Butch to pull out a sheet of crib notes in earnest answer. It's classic hilarity rarely found today.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Butch Cassidy is absolutely beautiful, with top-notch production values and gorgeous on-location venues that, coupled with scenes like the Super-posse chase which, though many have argued drags on far too long, really captures the vast openness and the beauty of the once great Western frontier.\r\n\r\nDespite a screenplay that may come off as sloppy and, to quote one critic, 'schizophrenic', in the opinion of this reviewer, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is rather well in line with its titular characters, who don't know what the hell they're going to do in this newer, smaller America in which they've become anachronisms.  They try to adapt, to change, but they end up realizing that they can't change who they are.  In all their running from the law, they've failed to grasp that society has run faster, in fact raced straight past them, and they're just too battle-weary to keep up.  So they do the only thing they know how to do... they draw a pair of pistols and charge their fate in a blaze of undying glory.  It's an entertaining Western, an entertaining comedy, hell, an entertaining film, one that's great to watch simply because it's got Paul Newman and Robert Redford in it.  Sure, it may not seem coherent all the time, but maybe that's what makes it the brilliant Western and comedy that it is.  In a word, ambiguous? No. Dynamite.  But only enough to blow the safe.",

Their dumb, dusty, beautiful mugs wane into desperate bemusement (but never fail to crack wise) as they are chased from the land by a kind of mythically unstoppable lawman, carrying thunder, whose appearance signals the beginning of the end of Butch and Sundance's heady, anti-establishment ways.\r\n\r\nTheir last stand is unforgettable and poignant, going out guns blazing; to the bitter, bullet-ridden end creatures of beatifically naive defiance.",

The plot is of two friends who rob banks and trains for a living. But they somehow manage to do it without hurting anyone, which further strengthens the relationship between the viewer and the main characters. The relationship between Butch and Sundance is can be both serious and funny. It is quite obvious that Paul Newman and Robert Redford work very well together as partners. There are elements of humor, action, and romance that further absorb you further into the movie. The most interesting aspect of the movie is the fact that you can't decide if you want Butch and Sundance to keep getting away with the crimes. You love the characters and want them to prevail, but at the same time, theyre bank robbers and should be brought to justice.",
