When Cal embarks on a business venture to gain the favor of his dad, he finds himself dealing with his estranged mother (Jo Van Fleet), now the owner of a brothel, and tensions in the family rise even further when he begins to fall for Aron's girlfriend, Abra (Julie Harris).",

            "content": "East of Eden was no doubt an impactful film when released back in the 50s, but age has not treated it well.  It's still passable entertainment, but scenes that once had great dramatic impact are now more likely to elicit laughs or brow-furrowing than anything else.  The story itself, based on John Steinbeck's classic novel, is timeless, a family drama filled with conflict and deception.  James Dean plays Cal, the black sheep of the family, the misunderstood son trying to find his way in life.  Dean is generally solid in the lead role, but sometimes plays out his anguish a little too enthusiastically \u2013 ditto for the rest of the cast.  Another issue of the era, not unique to just this film, is the swelling music score, overpowering to the point of distraction.  And the maudlin scenes follow one another from start to finish, including a cringe-worthy final scene that is typical of the era.  Again, it's not bad\u2026it's just not what it once was.",

As usual - which is admittedly difficult to say about an actor who only appeared in three pictures - Dean overacts.  I'd have to give Miss Harris the honors for best performance in the this, not Mr. Dean.  Watching a movie requires \"suspension of disbelief\" but there's a lot here that ranges from laughable to absurd, from the opening where Cal rides atop a coal-fired train in white trousers and beige sweater and arrives without so much as a smudge on his rear end to a man with two able-bodied sons of draft age who sends other men's sons to their death while his remain at home.  OK, the story wouldn't end the way it did but we know that in the real world a draft board member whose two sons are still civilians would be either an object of derision or strung up from the nearest lamppost.  John Steinbeck's novels were held in high regard; I've never read them but I hope the source material was better than this Hollywood melodrama.  It's not Mr. Kazan's best effort.",

It's a very heavy-handed Cain and Abel allegory, transplanted into California at the eve of World War I; the Biblical themes probably went over much better in the \u201850s. He does give an emotional performance as the loner Cal, but the film on the whole is pretty uninspired. There's a reason this one is the least well-known of his output. (2.5/5)",

The most beautiful thing about East of Eden is the biblical reference of Cain and Abel and thr whole story behind Adam's final word \"Timshel\", without any of that it's basically a movie about an edgy teenager who stole his brother's girl. \nKate wasn't supposed to show any kind of affection or regret towards Cal. The Kate I know would never give 5000$ to her son. Never!\nAdam became a simple conservative man who likes to read the Bible a lot. The Adam I know didn't even name his 2 sons, not until good old Samuel punched him in the face. \nPerhaps Abra was the only good character that was played well in the whole movie.

It's a retelling of the Biblical account of Cain & Abel, a story of 2 brothers in conflict. In this film they're competing for their father's affections during the height of World War 1, and the scales are very much tipped in one direction. The film might have its pacing issues, but it's the raw emotionality of the performances that make it such compelling viewing. Dean went full method in the very short amount of time he had in his movie career, and here it manifests itself in a person with such limited control over his feelings and impulses that he literally contorts with anguish. The style was frequently frowned upon back in the 50s for being too close to what Brando was doing, but you can see Dean giving it everything he has, and his behaviour brings out the best in the supporting cast. It has a few interesting subplots, such as the rise in anti-German sentiment and Cal's quest to find out about his past, but the story about father and son is where the film is mostly focused. One of only 3 films Dean completed in his lifetime, and one that loudly heralded his arrival.",

I don't know if the book ends the same as the film. Scenarios with the mother and brother, I feel, did not come to a satisfying conclusion. Jo Van Fleet was good though I would not call it an Oscar-winning performance. James Dean was very good throughout the movie and well-deserving of an Oscar nomination.

            "content": "Maybe I shouldn't have read the book immediately before diving into this big-screen adaptation. Even still, I'm quite sure I wouldn't have cared for it. Elia Kazan's altered, stripped-down take on John Steinbeck's classic tome discards several crucial characters, corrupts a few more, pointlessly changes themes and completely misses the point of its source material.\n\nLee and Samuel, the novel's two most enduring, intriguing moral anchors, are completely excluded from the cinematic take, and in their absence the remaining cast seems to move without a firm direction, lashing out and contradicting themselves. It's shocking, how few genuinely likable characters remain in the finished film. Cal, deeply conflicted but relatable in the novel, is repurposed into a brooding, reckless, self-pitying brat in a barely-contained turn by James Dean. Aron, his naive, virtuous twin brother, becomes a sanctimonious, temperamental jerk whose sudden collapse musters little sympathy. Their father, who always meant well, despite his struggles with a bitter past, is now a two-dimensional hypocrite without depth. It's not the first time I've seen a movie divert so wildly from its roots, but it's a particularly bad example of doing so without just cause.\n\nThe production does deserve credit for experimentation, although even those fruits are a mixed bag. Stutters and stumbles are left in the dialog, which lends an unusual sense of spontaneity and honesty, but also accentuates Dean as a very awkward, rough-edged actor, not quite ready for the spotlight that's been shone upon him. Frequently ambitious camera angles scratch a creative itch, but distract from the important plot developments proceeding within. The entire film is like this, brimming like a potful of ideas, half-cooked and then served as a chewy, unrewarding finished product.\n\nIn essence, it's a bit of a phantom, bearing the ghost of a great premise but lacking in substance and heart. Threads are weakly pursued and then abandoned. Resolutions, if and when we get them, pack very little emotional punch. I expected much more. What an underachievement.",

He is always being told he is a bad guy, but you get to watch Dean's character demonstrate his decency. It's a highly complex role that Dean nails with a nuance and sincerity most grown actors could not have pulled off.\n\nDirector Elia Kazan continues to reinvent the wheel with innovative direction and creative cinematography. You will see faces framed in the smallest viewpoints with constantly new perspectives to challenge your own notions of what these characters are thinking. For example, there is a beautiful shot with James Dean walking out from under a tree that moves into his silhouette that only a master director like Kazan could have managed.\n\nFurthermore, Kazan even swings the camera while James Dean goes back and forth on a swing, then switches the angle of the camera to display the power balance shifting. East of Eden is filled with these symbolic moments depicted by visual metaphor. Kazan is at his best here. East of Eden is as good as A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata!, or On the Waterfront. Kazan was clearly a genius director.\n\nJohn Steinbeck's writing is as beautiful and earnest as any classic drama script. Paul Osborn adapts the screenplay with a relatable quality through Dean's performance and character. East of Eden is as much a testimonial of the 1910's as it is a family drama or a forbidden romance story. This is top tier writing at its most refined.\n\nCheck out East of Eden for an American classic in drama, romance, and acting.

Plus there\u2019s something going on in the first few scenes where they recorded a lot of dialogue after the fact and inserted it later, which made the conversations seem clunky and awkward. But the movie took a turn and became something I never expected. As Cal starts to do things to try and earn his father\u2019s respect and love, I was on board with the story. James Dean plays the emotional swings of the story so well, because you want Cal to be a tough and strong character at first, but then show a lot of heart when things finally come to a head. I totally sympathized with him in this performance, and now I see why he is so revered despite the short career. It helps that I watched this film at just the right time for each big moment to hit me hard in the gut. I cried multiple times in the last act of East of Eden and that always makes me care about a story more, because I know it was meaningful and effective. There were still problems with the production, because I noticed the bad ADR in a few other scenes. Also I couldn\u2019t track the motivations of Abra, particularly when she first makes the turn and starts being nice to Cal. Yet I don\u2019t think those flaws are the things that will stick with me. Instead I will never forget the birthday party scene or the final scene and how they tore me up emotionally.

The film zoomed straight to the first of two most important events in the story. Firstly Cal discovering his long lost mother / brothel owner and meeting her. Secondly Cal\u00b4s emotional devastation when his monetary present to his righteous dad was rejected. Cal then took revenge by taking his angel brother Aaron to meet his Madam mother, thus destroying his innocence and image of their mother being a saint. Brilliant performance all round especially James Dean. He was born for the role with his boyish, winsome and rebellious nature, yet having a fragile and sensitive side in him. Although the film did a fine job in conveying Steinbeck\u00b4s story essence, one serious omission was the Chinese butler/servant in the Trass family. In the book, he was the pillar of strength for the Trass family, both morally and also for all the daily chores that kept the household in good order.",

            "content": "Watch James Dean in any one of his three films and you'll observe that he always seems to be a young man in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Not in the sense that his characters are unyieldingly conflict-ridden - though they are - but in the sense that Dean himself seems to exist on a different planet than the greater sum of his peers.  He seems too contemporary, too ageless, as if it were destined from the start that he'd never live long enough to be personified as anything else besides a symbol of teenage rebellion.  Looking at a colored photograph of the actor at his prime and an outsider might not realize that in front of them is a star of sixty years ago, not a suave, cool fixture of the modern age.\n\tIt's astonishing how unscathed Dean's legend has remained sixty-one years after his 1955 death.  One comprises their filmography of only a trio of movies and they become largely forgotten, a cultishly fondled over sign of the times.  But Dean's then (and still) excitingly fresh personal appeal, endorsed by films and performances that harnessed his capabilities miraculously well, allows for his persona to go far beyond what the big screen usually allows.  Like Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, or even John Wayne, he seems to be additionally playing James Dean, not just a character sketched out by a persnickety screenwriter.\n \t1955's \"East of Eden,\" his feature debut and the only movie released during his lifetime, contains his best and most pensive performance.  He's so much an \"other\" (when comparing his acting style to his studio system controlled peer group) that a bizarre charge overcomes us when watching him; we cling onto every move he makes, as if trying to avoid losing grasp of the fleeting longevity of his stardom.  It's a characterization not made impressive out of stagey, fiery monologues, per usual in the melodrama preferring Hollywood of the time, but out of idiosyncratic zeal.  Heavy on improvisation and dependent on contortionistic body movement as an emotional release, Dean's performance was unprecedented in 1955 and remains to be extraordinary.\n\t\"East of Eden\" itself is a loose adaptation of the second half of John Steinbeck's novel, which unapologetically modernized the biblical story of Cain and Abel.  The film, set in coastal California in the late 1910s, follows the lives of Cal and Aron Trask (Dean and Richard Davalos), the sons of a humble vegetable farmer (Raymond Massey).  Aron is a charming extrovert, dating the susceptible Abra (Julie Harris) and uninhibitedly preferred by his old man.  He's ripe for a sensible future, which marks for great contrast from his brother.\n\tCal, by comparison, is a gawky introvert whose self-confidence has been maimed by his father's unhidden disfavor of him.  He acts erratically and isn't able to socialize with normality - he's never known what it's like to be loved.  His mother's death, said to have occurred just a few years after his birth, hasn't helped his unstable identity, either.  Cal longs to be like his father, who is a smart businessman, and he perhaps wishes to be more like Aron, who is self-possessed and better able to express himself.\n\tBut the film finds him at a major turning point in his life.  Nearing adulthood, Cal is starting to move past contently living in the shadows; he craves something more.  Much of his newfound desire to break out of his shell has to do with his discovering that his mother (Jo Van Fleet) isn't dead - she's actually the owner of the town brothel - and that love really can exist; he finds it with Abra, who's beginning to doubt her long-standing relationship with Aron.  But patriarchal approval is the one thing that stands in the way of Cal's potential, and success will elude him until he receives it.\n\tWhereas \"Rebel Without a Cause\" has dated since its initial release, now playing as a rather safe (but still compelling) coming-of-age shocker, \"East of Eden\" prevails as a meditative family drama, visually inventive and naturalistically acted.  It captures what made Dean so special beautifully, allowing for his own ticks and sensitivities to break through the celluloid, and it surrounds him with an ensemble just as distinctively disparate.  Harris, though ten years too old for the part, brings accessible girl-next-door allure to the part, so convincingly at a psychological tug-of-war that our empathy swallows us.  Van Fleet is incendiary as Cal and Aron's wicked mother, and Burr is superbly condescending as a father unable to realize the damage his emotional put-downs are having on his youngest.\n\tBut \"East of Eden\" is Dean's movie, and never does he let us forget it.  His character's acute delicacy makes him all the more of a gripping protagonist - we're desperate to get inside his head, akin to the way Harris's Abra attempts to free him from his self-hate - and the emotional bruises that come along with his imbalances hurt us just as much as they hurt him.  \n\tWe can only ponder what would have become of Dean's career had he been able to be more than a three hit wonder.  Would he have continued redefining himself, like Newman, or would he have become a victim of his own insecurities, like Brando? Ambiguity reigns, and the viewing of \"East of Eden\" is partially so thrilling because we consume so much of him.  We have so little.  But the film is also a magnificent drama, in spite of Dean's being in it.  Sure is fortunate to have him, though - couldn't imagine anyone else in his shoes, just like I can't picture a different icon of 1950s teenage disaffection besides him.",

Probably my favourite thing in it, a principled rebel against societal norms that would see her 'fenced in' as a woman.\n\nI also saw the film as a powerful statement on the corrupting influence of capitalism on human relations...

The movie took a while to draw me in. At the beginning the characters are pretty one-dimensional and hard to identify with. But as it went on I started to warm up. Two scenes in particular I liked were the scene where Cal asks his mom for money and the scene with Cal and Abra on the ferris wheel. At times this feels like it's missing big chunks that would better show how the characters develop. That's one difficulty with adapting an epic book, unless you make it the length of Gone With The Wind.

A long time ago, his family was abandoned by his mother and he sets out to collect money to help return the favours given by his father. In hopes to be accepted by his father, mother, and respected by the town and his own brother, Cal Trask is one complex character that I could just not get enough of. James Dean is terrific in this film and the screenplay is adapted brilliantly. Lessons about life, love, and happiness leap off the screen and I bought every message.

Kazan's adaptation is smaller in scope, and this is out of necessity, but what is left is so devoid of context that the characters' motivations are trivialized and they come off as hysterical.

The movie started out with Cal following Kate around but if you didn't read the book you wouldn't know who they were or what was happening. Another problem about this movie is they completely missed the themes of the book. They sliced up the book, selected a few random parts, added a few new details of their own, and just threw it all together. What happened to the very important Timshel? Where was Lee? He was a major character and very important to the story. All the biblical allusions got left behind too along with the first 3/4 of the book.

It brings tears of laughter to my eyes trying to picture an individual who is attempting to figure out the whole movie without knowing the real Cathy. Secondly, the laughter continues with the ferris wheel scene. Abra tells Cal that she is in love with Aron and that her and Aron are going to get married, but 30 seconds later she kisses Cal. This part demonstrates the unpredictability in the comedy of the film. Lastly, in the ensuing argument that follows the ferris wheel scene, ends with one of the greatest use of english. The words spoken by Cal can only be translated by a fictional character known as the Tasmanian Devil. This phrase is the part of the movie that turns it into a comedy because it turns a dead serious scene into the funniest part of the movie.\n    Overall, I highly recommend this movie to all who are looking for a good laugh.",

Also, the director completely leaves out the first half of the book which plays a vital role in the development of the plot.\n     On a lighter note, not all of the movie was completely useless. Some of the crucial scenes from the book were incorporated such as when Cal tries to make his father proud by giving him 5000 dollars. Also, when it came to Cathy, well she was just as psychotic and deceitful as John Steinbeck wanted her to be.\n     Regardless, the acting in the movie was very poor.

While Dean plays a convincing Cal, the rest of his co-stars lack aptitude. Neither the story line nor the characters correlate too closely to the book, as the film starts towards the end of the novel, and does a poor job of giving important background information about the protagonists. The tale goes at a relatively fast pace, making it hard for the viewer to make essential connections within the narrative. The absence of Lee and Samuel Hamilton (principal characters in Steinbeck's novel), Aron's conflicted character, and Abra's mixed messages make this a befuddling (as well as unenjoyable) movie for those who have read the book.

For starters, the acting in this film was sub-par and for the entire movie there was a disconnection between actor and audience in the sense that it was difficult to understand what the actors wanted you to feel. The tone wasn't conveyed properly and therefore comprehension of the story was minimal. To go along with below average portrayal of the characters, the storyline missed important details of the novel that were needed for some of the major themes and ideas. Granted the book has too much to put into one movie, they still should've included more about Timshel, a key theme throughout the book.The only thing that made the movie watchable was the fight scene, but this is only because of how  immature the acting seemed with their unrecognizable muffled shouts.\n    Although East of Eden is a classic in its own right it is a movie that falsely portrays  ideas given in the novel and has a moderate entertainment level due to the lack of execution on the actors behalf.",

The movie did a wonderful job of keeping good and evil equal and opposite throughout the movie. Cal and Aron were the best examples of this. Early in the movie, Cal was portrayed as evil while Aron represented all that was good. Late in the movie, the role was switched as Aron became the bad child when he left his father, however Cal took on the role of good and was there for his father.\n\tA major gap in the movie was the absence of Lee, Adam?s servant. Lee had gotten Adam over his depression, as well as always tried to convince Cal that there was good in everyone. Lee was seen as the median in the book between Adam and his son, Cal. The tension between the two was evident, but without Lee, the resolution of Cal to be with his father was much less significant.\n\tAs previously stated, this entire novel was based around the idea of good opposing evil. The main point in the novel was that each person had the ability to make their own decisions and choose right from wrong. Lee was the first to reveal this idea to the Trask family. The fact that the most important philosophy in the novel was left out completely defeats the entire purpose for making a movie without it. This was the ultimate factor as to why this movie was a big disappointment and completely destroyed the novel?s only purpose.\n\tAlthough this movie was relatively interesting, it turned away from the book too much to be enjoyable to anyone who has read the novel. Although you could follow the movie along pretty smoothly, without Lee and the main idea of Timshel, the movie lacked the clarity the book had and that was the ultimate downfall of the movie.",

Kazan also cuts out the Samuel Hamilton and Lee, two major characters who provided great significance to the overall plot of the novel. One of the most critical points in the novel is when Adam, Lee, and Samuel discuss the story of Cain and Abel and their realization of man's ability to choose. The result of its exclusion from the movie leaves the audience with a broken perspective about the true motive of the novel and its overall themes.\n\n    James Dean's performance of Cal similarly had its ups and downs. Where Cal in the book struggled between good and evil, James Dean represented wonderfully. However, Dean portrayed Cal as extremely depressed and mopey all the time, which overall limited his character and his ability to connect with the audience. Cal's relationship with Aron was not as strained as it was made in the movie, and the viewers couldn't have possibly been able to understand the true friendship that had existed between the brothers. \n    Overall, Kazan failed to truly captivate the audience with the same effect and strength as Steinbeck had done in his novel, even though Kazan made very obvious attempts to remain with the storyline.

This movie is yet another example of the horrifying loss of intelligence between what's on paper and what shows up on the big screen. Less than half of Steinbeck's original story has survived the brutal chopping block called Hollywood. It is a true tragedy that a story once filled with noble themes such as Good versus Evil and a person's free will to choose between them has be reduced to a story of two brothers fighting over the love of their father and a girl. The beautiful parallels that Steinbeck wrote between Cyrus and Adam's fatherhood, Charles and Cal's roles as unloved, and the contrast between the Hamilton and the Trask families are gone.  In fact many of these characters never came to life at all. Samuel Hamilton and Lee, the two main fatherly figures of the story, were completely written out, despite the major emphasis on fatherly love portrayed in the movie. Even the characters that are included in the movie are lacking, especially Kate, who's true evil nature is never explained. The only redeeming point in this entire movie that I can see is Abra, the girl in love. Her switch between loving Aron to loving Cal is much more seamless in the movie than in the book. However, the way the boys interact with each other over her is poorly acted out, especially the fight scene. Over this entire movie didn't reach my expectations at all.

Also, the cinimatography was quite stunning, but I'm not too big of a fan on the \"burn't cheese pizza\" lettering they used for opening and closing credits.

Here however, (impressively given that it was his film debut!) he shows there was more to him than being able to play the good looking outsider who's 'complicated'. His performance utterly shows us the man had real acting chops, beyond looking young and old at the same time. To be such a master of your craft so young is truly impressive.

            "content": "Though the film had some good attributes, it did not do justice to the book. James Dean did a nice job of depicting Cal and I thought the cinematography was well done.  The bar scene where you see the two brothers positioned one behind the other after the mob fight was especially great.  There was a comic book/cartoonish quality to that scene that I thought was really interesting.  The last scene was touching.  Beyond this, the movie was a really poor representation of the book. Abra's character was especially completely miscast.  While she is supposed to have a 'mature' personality, her maturity is not as one dimensional as it was represented. Her demeanour in the film was so over the top earnest and wholesome that I found her to be an incredibly irritating character that lacked depth.  She is a much more complex character in the book and this did not show through in the movie at all.  Cathy Ames (the mother) should have been much more devilish in character.  She never justifies why she is the way she is so blatantly in the book as she does in the film.  Cathy is a far more interesting character than simply a cut throat business woman as she is portrayed in the film.  Cal and Aaron's relationship was treated very superficially.  Their connection is characterized by both love and hate, yet the movie did not do a fair job of depicting this ambivalence. In contrast to the movie, the theme of jealousy in the book is a lot more subtle and underlying yet just as destructive.  The movie was unable to capture the seething quality of the emotion.  Cal never blatantly says he is jealous, he just is and its something he torturously struggles with.  Also, Cal and Abra never get together romantically until after Aaron goes to war.  The only borderline non-platonic encounter that he and Abra have prior to this time, is when Cal whispers something dirty in her ear when they are children.  One of the biggest problems with the movie is that they left out one of the central characters --Lee-- the Chinese care taker and friend of the family.  Lee is such a pivotal character in the book that I was shocked that he was included in the film.  Overall, I could not get myself to like the movie too much.  Perhaps my opinion of the film would have been different had I not read the book.",

            "content": "At least from a career standpoint, I don't know if I feel more sorry for James Dean or, well, anyone else in this film who isn't James Dean. Forget east of Eden, just about everyone else's careers went south after this film. Okay, maybe the supporting cast didn't fall that fast, though they didn't really take off all that much after this film film, and all the while, James Dean didn't do but three roles that weren't uncredited bit parts before he died, and people are still talking about him, or at least about how he always looked so tired all the time. Well, to be fair, he did do some pretty good films, and he was really good in them, with this film being no exception, though what else would you expect from the director of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and... \"The Last Tycoon\"? Okay, I can think of some people who would say that we can just forget about that and just leave with our fond memories of Elia Kazan, of which, there are plenty, if you can remember them in the first place. A good bit of Kazan's work hasn't really stuck in everyone's memory banks all that deeply, yet the people who do remember his work can tell you that this film was certainly something to behold, being a classic masterpiece. To those people, I say shut up you annoying nostalgiacs, because while this film is good, it's not that good, being an Eden held back by a few corrupting snakes.\r\n\r\nThe film hits its slower spots, though rarely, if ever to a terribly dull degree, and what slow spots the film does hit are few and far between. However, were slowness more prevalent, it would most likely still be among the least of this film's worries, because the biggest blow to this film is that it is structurally all over the place. Now, the story isn't a total mess, with most everything scattered everwhere in the most unkept and uneven of fashions, yet the film is still quite uncomfortable in a lot of key places in its progression. Certain turns in storyline or focus are jarring and sudden, lacking enough time for you to fully lock into the situation, thus leaving the film a tad disengaging here and there, while other certain sudden shifts - particularly when it comes to characters - render the film a tad hard to follow. Still, it all comes down to long lines of non-oomph, with the film not really falling all that limp, though not really taking off that far when it does finally pick up. For all extents and purposes, this should be just another average film that rests among the workmanlike pile of films that have earned notoriety, mainly because of the stars who head. However, this film is better than that, perhaps falling a bit too limp at points, though not to where it completely falls out of being genuinely good, being made so by quite a few aspects that are mostly subtle, yet make quite a difference.\r\n\r\nOkay, now, maybe Ted D. McCord's cinematography doesn't necessarily make quite a difference, as it is only occasionally outstanding, yet when it does stand out, it's pretty impressive. Early on in the film, a scene in which James Dean's Cal Trask character is made to read excerpt from the Bible is riddled with very cleverly staged and lit camera shots that really capture the hint of bleakness in the air that reflects our characters and really sets up the themes of the film, in which you can find quite a few other fancy and effective shots of this nature. Still, again, these fine shots are too sporadic to stick a landing as a key strength to telling this story, so in order for this film to really be good, it's just got to be a good story. Well, sure enough, while the story structure is very messy, the overall product presented is generally compelling, with intriguing themes and concepts that help keep it afloat, yet not without the help of some upstanding performances. Sure, Julie Harris is pretty bad, when not simply mediocre, yet most everyone else is engagingly charismatic, though there are some standouts, such as Jo Van Fleet, whose surprisingly fairly subtle and thoughtful portrayal of an untrusting and very business-oriented woman facing the risk of changing tremendously when considerably grand events and discoveries begin to fall into her life makes her among your more compelling aspects to the film. As for James Dean, with all of my joking around about how he's become such a big icon, even with his paper-slim filmography, he got those Oscar nominations and all of this notoriety for a reason, as he was the original great actor to lose young, something made clear very early on in the film as he very charismatically, yet ever so believably manages to nail the ticks and eccentricities of such a disturbed and clearly unhealthy person like the Cal Trask character in a fashion that definately leaves you aware that our lead is not all there, yet still has enough competence in him to hold layers. Well, sure enough, while the writing leaves those layers to jar in on occasion, Dean never lets up on making the complexities within his character very organic, presenting a person who is well-intentioned and reasonably competent, even with his problems, looking for self-value and respect as a good man, thus making for a very restrained, yet very engrossing lead performance that stands as further testament to just what we miss about the late, great Mr. Dean.\r\n\r\nOverall, outside of a few slow spots, the real blow to the film is its structural messiness, from jarring story shifts to sudden character changes, that leave the film a bit hard to follow and often rather disengaging, while long periods of limited oomph leave the film to run the risk of descending to simply average, yet it manages to its own, secured by occasions of clever cinematography and consistency in story compellingness, really brought to life by generally strong performances, the strongest of which being delivered by the late, great James Dean, whose layered, subtle and enthralling lead performance helps in ultimately making \"East of Eden\" a mostly intriguing study on morality and value.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

I personally feel this is the lesser of Dean's three starring roles, which isn't to say it's a bad one. Dean is an incredibly naturalistic actor, known for his improvisational style and realistic delivering of dialogue. He reminds me very much of young Marlon Brando. It's perhaps no big surprise that Brando's game changing performance in 1954's On the Waterfront seems to inform the performances that Dean gave a year later. \nThe movie itself is well told and actually quite a bit darker than you would think for 1955. It's full of the kind of teen angst and anti-authoritarian overtones that would fill Dean's next, most iconic film, Rebel Without A Cause.",

It's basically a Cain and Abel type of story, and agriculture plays an important role even. It's not a strict adaptation of that story, but it is the best reference point to use to describe things.\n\nThings are rather dramatic, though they dip into melodrama at times. And, in typical Kazan fashion, there's a lot of subtext, mostly since the imminent entrance of the U.S. into World War i and anti-German sentiment plays a fairly sizable role throughout.\n\nIt took me a bit to get interested and involved, but once I tapped into this film's groove, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Like the other two film's Dean did I do think it's overrated to a degree, but it's still pretty solid even then. Of the three, this one's #2 for me behind Rebel Without a Cause.\n\nIt's good, but personally I didn't think it was outstanding or anything. The acting is terrific though, and there's some great camerawork, but it just didn't completely seem like my thing. If it were, I'd probably have a somewhat higher opinion of it. Still though, it's getting a really solid recommendation from me.",

The farmer has one straight and narrow boy that does well in school and lives a relatively normal life.  He also has an eccentric boy who wants to help his dad recover his lost fortune.  The eccentric boy looks up his mother, who he was told is dead, and hopes to rekindle enough of a relationship to garner some money to invest in a venture to repay his father's losses.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know it was true?\"\r\n\"Because she ain't no good and I ain't no good.\"\r\n\r\nElia Kazan, director of A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, Baby Doll, Splendor in the Grass, The Last Tycoon, and A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, delivers East of Eden.  The storyline for this picture is mesmerizing and extremely intense.  It reminded me of a cross between What's Eating Gilbert Grape and The Long Hot Summer.  The acting was mesmerizing and the cast includes James Dean, Julie Harris, Lois Smith, and Jo Van Fleet.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything nice about her at all?\"\r\n\r\nThis is my first ever James Dean movie and I found it equal in terms of quality to A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront.  This is an epic picture with great acting and fascinating characters.  This is a must see for students of film and storytelling and another great picture by the wonderful Elia Kazan.\r\n\r\n\"She wasn't like other people.\"\r\n\r\nGrade: A+",
