            "content": "Time for another episode of Me Criticizing Beloved Classics When No One Asked! Basically, this movie is two halves which each belong to some other, better movie. The first half sets up a lot of really interesting ideas around coming of age, parental abuse, domestic violence, and unchecked ego. The second half follows up on completely separate concepts focusing entirely on a new character, a misfit romance, and a police shootout. The movie would have been amazing if it actually followed up on the ideas it introduced, but it feels like the writers didn't know what to do with it so they just went for clich\u00e9s and shock factor instead of emotional closure.\n\nJames Dean does give a solid, iconic performance and I really love a lot of the dialogue. But that's not enough for me to overlook the obvious flaws in this classic. Bring on the haters.",

            "content": "First time ever watching this. Probably the last time as well. I don't understand the fascination with this film. It's simply a mediocre film at best.\n\nThat first scene was really hard to get through. But having seen the entire film now, I understand why it was necessary. It introduces us to the main three characters and gives us a preview of the struggles each one is going through. \n\nJim (Dean) is struggling with the fact that his father is weak, and always feels like he needs to prove himself. Judy (Wood) is at odds with the fact that her father doesn't love her as much because she is growing up. Plato (Mineo) is seeking the love a parental figure because his parents have practically abandoned him.\n\nEach character finds something they are missing within the scope of the other characters. So the three of them essentially become a family. Simple enough story, but maybe I've seen the teenager tropes in so many movies throughout my life that this seems like just another movie.\n\nI feel like James Dean severely overacted at certain times and it really turned me off to it all. I feel Like Natalie Wood was the star in this. She just caught my attention and it felt right. Mineo was half way decent, a bit whiny for my liking, but cool. \n\nFilms of this era are so simple and straightforward, with many films copying the style. I guess this movie doesn't resonate more with me, because I feel like I've seen this same (or similar) situation before. \n\nAll in all, it's a perfectly watchable movie. Typical teenager issues arise, and some serious consequences are paid at the end.\n\nI wouldn't feel bad about recommending this film, especially since it's considered a classic. \n\nThis gets a LennyReviewz Score of: 6/10",

Jim (James Dean), Judy (Natalie Wood), and Plato (Sal Mineo) all feel like outsiders, thanks in large part to unstable home situations.  Fate seemingly brings them together, allowing them to find solace in the company of each other until outside influences lead them to what feels like an inevitable tragedy.  Strangely, the movie feels like it works best in its most quiet moments (Jim and Plato's conversation in the observatory theater, for example) as opposed to the more famous dramatic scenes (Jim screaming \u2018you're tearing me apart!!' in the police station).  While it may not live up to its considerable reputation, it is worth watching for the performances of Dean and Wood.",

But there's actually something kinda weird and dark about this movie. Like, it somehow feels way heavier than Lynch in certain moments, but I cant quite tell what's making it feel so strange nor if it's even intentional.\n\nMore, there's something still very cool, albeit problematic, about this film. I hate to admit it, but I still really want to be James Dean, toxic masculinity and all. And I don't even identify as a cis, hetero male, and I know we've learned so much since these times, but I still dig it! Which made my viewing and conflicting feelings all the more bizarre. \n\nI know people have spent a lot of time watching and writing about the ethos of this movie and James Dean, but frankly I'm too lazy to read about it, or care. But I definitely recommend this movie, you just gotta be in the right mood for it.",

The acting and direction here were all over the place, the dialogue is atrocious, and I have some serious concerns as to whether the writer was a sociopath.\n\n Without a doubt James Dean is an icon, but he was outshined in this film by Natalie Wood. I found his character to be aloof to the point of being unbelievable, which I'm assuming is mostly due to bad directing. Wood, on the other hand, handled her character exceptionally well under the circumstances and is much more believable as a teenager than Dean. \n\nSpoiler alert:\nIf the events of this film had taken place over several weeks, I may be more inclined to accept the story. However, to say that in just one day Jim moves to a new town, gets arrested for drunkenness, meets a girl, gets in a knife fight, drives a stolen car off a cliff, has to go on the run from a gang, makes a girl fall in love with him after her \"friend's\" death, breaks into an abandoned house and an observatory, is found by said gang, gets shot at, and loses his new best friend in a shootout with police is too much of a stretch for me. \n\nThe one thing that this film did get partially correct was the generational conflict between parents and their children. \n\nOverall, it's worth watching once.",

Mineo's Plato is a good example of the film just being too over the top for its own good - some parental abandonment is apparently all it takes to exhibit psychotic delusions, get in a police shootout, and literally murder puppies. Toss in some knife fights and deadly car racing and you might mistake the film for a comedy with the level of insanity that it ascribes to the life of an apparently average high school student in the '50s.
