            "content": "The Night of the Hunter might be the most overrated ‘classic' film ever.  The story itself is fine – Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) is a serial killer who sets his sights on the widow (Shelley Winters) of a condemned man he shared a prison cell with, knowing that his cell mate had hidden a considerable amount of cash on the property.  Mitchum is great in the lead role, the cinematography is generally pretty impressive, and the lighting is spectacular in some scenes.  However, the first twenty minutes of the movie are almost unbearable to watch, filled with shaky (and needless) aerial establishing shots, choppy editing, ridiculous overacting, and a number of shots that add nothing to the story.  From that point on, with the exception of some horrible acting by the widow's two children, the movie is passable, but not much more than that.",

            "content": "In West Virginia in the 1930s, Reverend Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) is a misogynistic serial killer and self-appointed preacher who travels along the Ohio River, justifying the women he murdered with his switchblade knife after marrying them for their money as doing God's work. After reaching a town sometime after his latest murder, Powell ends up being arrested for driving a stolen car and serves his sentence at Moundsville Penitentiary. By chance, Powell ends up sharing the same cell as Ben Harper Peter Graves), a local man who killed two men in a bank robbery for $10,000.[a] But with the police about to catch him, Harper makes his children John and Pearl promise to never reveal where the money is hidden after hiding it in Pearl's doll. Despite Powell's attempts to learn the money's location, Harper takes it to his grave. Following Harper's execution, the released Powell makes his way to Harper's hometown where he charms the townsfolk while wooing Harper's widow Willa (Shelley Winters), who has been working for Walter Spoon and his wife Icey.[8] Powell eventually marries Willa. Powell manages to win the town's trust, and only John is distrustful of him. John accidentally reveals that he knows the money's location when Powell overhears him reminding Pearl of their promise. Willa overhears Powell threatening Pearl to reveal the money, but Willa is deluded that Powell married her to redeem her soul, and begins preaching alongside him in tent revivals. Powell murders Willa soon after, dumping her body in the river while making it appear that she left him and the children for a life of sin. Powell proceeds to threaten John and Pearl before learning the money is hidden inside Pearl's doll...\n\n\"The Night of the Hunter\" was a total flop with both audiences and critics at its initial release, and Laughton never directed another film. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called the film \"a weird and intriguing endeavor,\" adding: \"unfortunately the story and the thesis presented by Mr. Grubb had to be carried through by Mr. Laughton to a finish—and it is here that he goes wrong. For the evolution of the melodrama, after the threatened, frightened children flee home, angles off into that allegorical contrast of the forces of Evil and Good.\" Gene Arneel of Variety summarized: \"The relentless terror of Davis Grubb's novel got away from Paul Gregory and Charles Laughton in their translation of Night of the Hunter. This start for Gregory as producer and Laughton as director is rich in promise but the completed product, bewitching at times, loses sustained drive via too many offbeat touches that have a misty effect.\" Harrison's Reports wrote, \"The picture might have some appeal for those who patronize art houses in search of the unusual in movie fare, but the great majority of those who see it will look upon it as a choppily-edited, foggy melodrama peopled with foggy characters.\" Life summed up the film, \"If sometimes it strains too hard at being simple and winds up being pretentious, it still is one of the year's most interesting and provocative films.\" The Legion of Decency gave the film a B because it degraded marriage, and the Protestant Motion Picture Council rated it \"objectionable,\" saying that any religious person would be offended by it. The film was also banned in Memphis, Tennessee, by the city's head of censorship, Lloyd Binford. Great Britain rated the film \"adults only.\" The film was shot in black and white in the styles and motifs of German Expressionism (bizarre shadows, stylized dialogue, distorted perspectives, surrealistic sets, odd camera angles) to create a simplified and disturbing mood that reflects the sinister character of Powell, the nightmarish fears of the children, and the sweetness of their savior Rachel. Due to the film's visual style and themes, it is also often categorized as a film noir. Laughton took this commercial failure of his first film personally, and never attempted to make another film. At the time of its release, The Night of the Hunter received mixed reviews, but over the years it has been reassessed and is now an undisputed classic. It began as a cult film, with a small group of fans, and regularly played at museums and in revival houses. Its popularity grew as a new generation of children were exposed to the film when it played on television. In the 1970s, as the field of film criticism began to expand, many articles were written about the film. Roger Ebert wrote, \"It is one of the most frightening of movies, with one of the most unforgettable of villains, and on both of those scores, it holds up ... well after four decades.\"  In 1992, the United States Library of Congress deemed \"The Night of the Hunter\" to be \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", and selected the film for preservation in its National Film Registry.\n\nThis 1955 classic directed by the great Charles Laughton, based on the 1953 novel of the same title by Davis Grubb, with Robert Mitchum in one of his most famous roles has been on my to see list for years. Was it worth the wait? Not fully to be completely honest. I had high hopes on a very dark and scary story in black and white, but to me this isn´t all that scary most of the times and Mitchum´s balance between brooding religious insanity and strange black humour/comedy doesn´t really work for me. His acting is also quite on and off despite the fact that he was such a great actor. And the film itself in pending between drama and comedy which creates a very unbalanced film. And the on and off cuts between real environments and studio environments is too obvious and a bit disturbing in terms of balance. And the ending is quite wobbly and very moralising. I do like, as mentioned, the use of German Expressionism (bizarre shadows, stylized dialogue, distorted perspectives, surrealistic sets, odd camera angles) to create a simplified and disturbing mood in the film. But, all in all, I am afraid that \"The Night of The Hunter\" didn´t blow my mind as I hoped.",

            "content": "\"It's a hard world for little things.\"\n\nThe story is about a religious fanatic marries a gullible widow whose young children are reluctant to tell him where their real daddy hid the $10,000, he'd stolen in a robbery.\n\n‘The Night of the Hunter' is a movie that perfectly encapsulates the spirit of dread in every frame. I went into this knowing only the small plot description (the same one above the paragraph), and certain shots that I have seen around on social media through film related sites. What surprised me the most is how uncomfortable and eerie the movie is, which at first, I wasn't sure if it was just me that was experiencing this. But when it finally clicked with me, then I knew I was in for something...interesting. \n\nThe character Harry Powell, an evil charlatan preacher who takes advantage of anyone in his sight, played brilliantly by Robert Mitchum. Mitchum is terrifying and the whole \"preacher\" thing is just a character he puts on to trick people. He talks with a strong commanding southern voice that makes his preachy words easily take control of anyone in his presence. Powell would do anything to get his filthy hands onto some money, even going as far as marrying the children's mother, a naive widow (played by Shelley Winters) who was hoping for some happiness in her life with Powell, but she's only a part of his scheme of things. He is the big bad wolf with a hypnotizing singing voice. There's no other way of describing him; he's just an evil son of a bitch. I will never forget that terrifying Satanic roar from the monster called Harry Powell.\n\nEven if people haven't seen the movie, but some may recognise the famous tattoo of 'L-O-V-E' on his left hand & 'H-A-T-E' on his right hand, where he tells an animated story of love and hate through his hands. The most visual way of showing love and hate at war with each other and I can see where director Spike Lee got the idea for the Radio Raheem scene in ‘Do the Right Thing'.\n\nA great supporting performance from Lillian Gish as Rachael Cooper, a religious woman, who unlike Harry Powell, practices what she preaches and has a hard as nails, no nonsense attitude, but also shows a loving and caring nature towards the already traumatise children. If you want a strong female character that shows you that they are strong rather than telling you, then this is it. If you come around looking for trouble, then you better kiss your ass goodbye and say hello to a barrel of a gun when it's pointed at your face by Mrs. Cooper. The scenes between her and Powell were the most fascinating aspects of the movie. \n\nThis is the first and sadly only feature film directed by Charles Laughton, which is a tragedy that he never made another movie after this, because the fact this is his first stab at a motion picture, as he was mostly a stage and screen actor, is beyond impressive.\n\nThe cinematography by Stanley Cortez is excellent and Gothic, as he gets to play around with the lighting and shadows, especially one shot of a wheel of a car at the bottom of the river with a dead body in the vehicle, with the blonde wavy hair dancing gently in the water, which made it look like a painting of a Gothic fairy-tale, while it also feels strangely peaceful, but very Brother's Grimm. I would imagine this must have been shocking for people back in 1955, the same how it's still shocking today. The River Boat scene is another sequence that's just candy to the eyes. \n\nWhat the movie does so brilliantly is how it makes you feel the sense of danger, even from a distance. There were a couple of times when I said \"wow\" at certain details and how it was executed. Movie magic baby! \n\nOverall rating: A marvellous mix of beauty and horror. Go check it out! It's great!",

Mitcham's performance as a heartless, almost inhuman monster of hateful misogyny and delusional religious extremism makes Harry Powell this terrifying specter not by scare or gore tactics, but by presence alone. This is perfectly contrasted by Lillian Gish's hardnosed, yet kind-hearted hermit named Rachel Cooper, whose feeble physique is made up by her strong conviction against the powerful Powell. Even the child actors, usually the weakest part in any movie, is really good (albeit uneven). This film is truly a masterpiece.

The duet is stunning and the little girl actually makes up for her acting with a beautiful singing voice while drifting down the river.

Gregory gave the directorial responsibilities to his friend Charles Laughton and the task of adapting the screenplay to Pulitzer Prize -winning author James Agee (AKF: \"A Death in the Family \"an autobiographical novel). Laughton claimed part-writing credits but this has been heavily disputed since the finding of Agee's original screenplay - showing the film to be shot as written by Agee. While Laughton has chosen to give his 1955 film (set in the 30s) the look of something that may have been produced in the silent era – he sometimes adds the odd unintentional laugh – these come via curious characters dotting the equally strange sets and situations. It was also evident Laughton had trouble with the kids. \n \nPerhaps the real power of this bizarre work should be credited to Director of Photography Stanley Cortez. Cortex has fused the film with striking visual atmosphere - adding an ethereal mood to the already dark story of a psychologically deranged ‘preacher' serial killer. Whoever called the shots, between the two of them, they certainly left us with a haunting visual treat – who could ever forget the long blond hair flowing within the river currents, intertwined with the long wisps of river growth!  The casting of stars from the silent era also gives the film an older look but there are undoubtedly many superb scenes to be enjoyed throughout this, at times, unsettling story. \n\nThere's an effective music score by Walter Schumann along with an odd casting choice of Mitchum as the hideous ‘reverend' but at least the horror elements were subtle and not in-your-face like the current cheapies some have become used too.",

You realize from the first scene what's going to happen. It's a shame these leading critics did not have the mental acumen to realize they were watching schmaltz perpetuated by Robert Mitchum.\n\nYet this plays repeatedly on TCM -- an outlet that should know better and which ignores many excellent films to focus on this trash -- and other \"leading: critics all tell us this is among the best. It isn't. The emperor is wearing no clothes. Yet, on TCM, some evangelical actress tells Osborne that \"good Christians\" don't act this way and he nods his approval. How's that for probing and deep?   Yet I've sat in church and watched many good Christians do worse.\n\nWhy do they tell us this is a good film?\n\nAll of them are in exalted (wealthy) positions, make more money than the rest of us, and have not been exposed to as much real life as usual. They live through film in their libraries. It's a nice way to live.\n\nBUT -- No preacher in West Virginia dressed in that manner in the 50s or now. No preacher would have acted that way. Even West Virginians, among the most highly gullible when it came to religious belief, would be able to spot a villain as open and nefarious as Robert Mitchum.\n\nWhy didn't Mitchum -- or any of the film reviewers -- ever go to an evangelical church? They're all over the world, in every city. You find the same fanaticism, the same \"turn off your brain - accept it all because I tell it to you\" diatribe we see in this movie. Did the film critics think this was fake? It's not. It's all too real.\n\nHad they heard of the snake charmers for Jesus? This brand of evangelical comes from Appalachia, too. Same mentality. It's all too real. It's just the way it is portrayed in this film, which is totally over the top, ridiculous, and almost deliberately dumb. This is not \"how\" they act, although this is exactly what they are saying.\n\nThe reviews miss all this. The don't seem to understand that if a screenwriter truly understood their subject matter they could have written a true masterpiece on this subject. What we have is not just bad, it is atrocious. Mitchum was a grotesque failure in regard to movie making and had no business working with the script or producing.\n\nThis is one of the very worst films I have ever seen in over 70 years and it has hoodwinked the critics who have little knowledge of what evil truly goes on in evangelical circles.",

            "content": "The dread of a stranger.\n\nCharles Laughton excels in his directorial debut with his horror suspense masterpiece The Night of the Hunter (1955). Utilizing eerie silhouettes, shadows, and lighting alongside creeping panning shots, Laughton makes The Night of the Hunter as unsettling a crime thriller as they come. Too bad Laughton never directed another film after this one. He had an eye for intense close ups, scary sequencing, fearsome suspense, and dreary settings. Nearly every shot of The Night of the Hunter is a stunning black and white picture of unbelievable framing. Laughton gave us all he had in The Night of the Hunter and I'm grateful for it.\n\nThe Night of the Hunter is the precursor to so many stories of a man preying on innocent children and unsuspecting women. It reminded me of The Series of Unfortunate Events. I love how much it brought back the expressionist visuals of old German cinema from the silent era. Laughton was clearly influenced by silents films and film noir. This is a wonderful example of a film noir with a scary twist.\n\nThe real star is Robert Mitchum as devious and deceitful Reverend Harry Powell. His large stature, dark clothing, cheery nature, haunting singing, frightening knuckles, and omni-present presence are all excellent aspects of his character. Mitchum plays Powell with such irreverence and cruelty in how he mocks religion and abuses women. His sly manipulation of the children is quite clever. Mitchum is truly one of the most horrifying movie villains ever for how realistic and grounded his monstrous widower feels. You can easily imagine a man as heinous as Reverend Powell.\n\nI must mention the nice supporting cast in The Night of the Hunter. Shelley Winters is lovely as the widow Willa Harper. You feel so bad for her and her situation. Billy Chapin is really good for a child actor as John Harper. His cleverness is the real hero. His facial expressions are pretty subtle and fascinating for such a young actor. Similarly, little Sally Jane Bruce is adorable and sweet as Pearl Harper. You just want to see that she's alright. Finally, silent film legend Lillian Gish is awesome as Rachel, the elderly caretaker of the children. Gish proves again why she is in the upper echelon of movie actresses with her stern, yet loving portrayal.\n\nIn all, I was impressed by The Night of the Hunter. It not only looks great, but it is so well acted. I found myself engaged to the very end. Give it a chance if you can get your hands on the Criterion Collection Blu-ray restoration.",

He haunts the screen with his presence, the shadows of his iconic hat and cheery sing-song lacing itself with the sinister undertone of his intent.\nFantastically scored and directed, and with one of the most terrifying and iconic villains of classic cinema, its no wonder that this film is rightfully revered as one of the all time greats, and with time may solidify itself as one of my all-time favourites.",

There are some creepy moments in this movie to be sure, and Robert Mitchum terrorizing two little kids will make you cringe or maybe have you urging them to run.

Oh, and it was fantastic to see 62-year-old Lillian Gish, who turns in a suitably feisty performance.  \n\nOn the other hand, Laughton's direction is heavy-handed and clunky at times, and there are plot moments that just don't seem quite right.  The acting ranges from poor to so-so, Mitchum included (though he certainly is a handsome fellow), and the soundtrack is too intrusive, annoyingly so in the jaunty bits.  I hated the ending, which breaks out clichés like a torch-wielding mob and overdone Biblical verse.  The movie was disturbing to audiences in 1955, likely because of the cruelty and evil shown in a man of the cloth, which made it not well received and caused Laughton to never direct again.

            "content": "The Night of The Hunter was actor Charles Laughton's first, and surprisingly only directorial effort. Based on the novel of the same name, written only a few years before this film adaptation. It tells the story of the manipulative, psychopathic, and murderous, preacher Henry Powell who after being arrested for car theft and sent to prison, comes into contact with a man that before being arrested, and sentenced to death by hanging, hid ten thousand dollars. Once Powell learns of this, he immediately goes after the money when he's released from jail. This sets the films plot in motion, where the only thing standing between him and the money are the mans two small, innocent kids.\n\nThe Night of The Hunter at its core is about the infinite battle between good and evil, and how one always eventually triumphs over the other. The message of this never ending battle is shown throughout the entire film. From Powells tattooed knuckles, reading love and hate, to the the final confrontation between the kind old woman, and Powell. The film also seems to have a message about the selfishness and corruptibility of humans. Powell believes that god agrees with his actions, but only because he's twisted everything in his own odd way. He is someone who was corrupted by the world long ago. John and Pearl on the other hand, the two young kids, are completely innocent, too young to have felt the corruption that the world they live in offers. This makes the encounter with the preacher even more frightening for them. By the end of the film Johns innocence is almost completely gone, and he just wishes the money never existed in the first place. It's almost a twisted coming of age story by the end.\n\nThe film, despite a slow, plot heavy beginning is worth watching. It uses shadows and the black and white format brilliantly, helping to create some creepy, unsettling scenes and imagery. Robert Mitchum is great as Powell, and the child actors do a solid job as well. Laughton does a great job directing, especially for a first film, thanks in no small part to Stanley Cortez's beautiful cinematography. Night of The Hunter was actually a critical and commercial failure on release in 1955, criticized for its taboo themes, and mixing of genres. This was extremely discouraging to Laughton, and stopped him from ever trying his hand at directing again. It's an absolute shame considering how well regarded the film has  become over the last twenty years. It was sadly just a film that needed its audience to be a little more accepting, and open minded then they were at the time.",

            "content": "The Night of the Hunter is a frightening film with a main character that is as close to pure evil as we've seen in film history. Robert Mitchum's portrayal of Harry Powell is absolutely incredible-it could give Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lector a run for his money in the villain department. Even beyond Mitchum, however, the film is a triumph. It's hard to believe director Charles Laughton stepped behind the camera for the first time with this effort. He creates a palpable sense of dread that completely overtakes you at times, the kind that most filmmakers would kill to achieve once in their careers.\n\nWe first meet \"preacher\" Harry Powell (Mitchum) leaving the scene of his latest crime-the murder of a Southern widow. It seems Powell has made a habit of this; He's killed a number of women after marrying them and stealing their money. Soon, however, he gets picked up and goes to jail for 30 days. While there, he learns that his cellmate (who is to be hung) has stashed $10,000 somewhere, and only the man's young children know where it is.\n\nOnce released, Powell tracks down the Harper family and charms his cellmate's widow, Willa (Shelley Winters). The entire town, including Willa and her daughter Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce), is taken with him immediately. Only Willa's son, John (Billy Chapin), is suspicious of his motives. As he casts his spell over Willa (and takes her to be his wife), he intensely works to find the money. But John isn't having any of it, and after Powell shows his true colors, he grabs his sister and runs away with the money-Powell hot on his heels.\n\nThe film looks absolutely gorgeous. Laughton uses light and shadow to magnificent effect, and his sense of time and place is impeccable. Only in the deep South of the 1950s would people fall under the spell of such a creepy guy. And the way Laughton speaks to the spell of religion (specifically, the way the best of us and the worst of us can be brought together by it) is intelligent and honest.\n\nWhat's even more impressive, however, is the tension that mounts over the course of the film. We're kept on the edge of our seats by Laughton as Powell proves himself resourceful and dogged enough to track down the children everywhere they go. Laughton uses a hymn as Powell's calling card, and the contrast between him and the softness of his words is frightening.\n\nI've already mentioned the marvelous work by Robert Mitchum, but the rest of the cast is excellent, as well. Shelley Winters sells her transformation-from weary widow to religious fanatic-quite well. Silent film star Lillian Gish does great work as a kindly woman who serves as a surrogate mother for lost children, including John and Pearl. The child actors predictably struggle, unfortunately. Pearl is the kind of whiny movie child that drives you crazy, and poor Sally Jane Bruce just isn't up to the task of making her tolerable. Billy Chapin, who plays John, isn't bad. But some of the material he's forced to work with near the end of the film is muddled, and he doesn't quite make certain actions seem believable.\n\nThough it was pretty much ignored during its time, The Night of the Hunter's stature has grown exponentially. It's now thought of quite highly by most film buffs, and it's not hard to see why. It's got an absolutely sensational lead performance, and the direction by acting legend Charles Laughton is tremendous. You really can't go wrong watching this film. It's not 100% perfect, but it's certainly something you won't easily forget.\n\nhttp://www.johnlikesmovies.com/night-of-the-hunter-review/",

This is a first-time director, child actors, a scenery-chewing villain, pre-established source material, and a backwoods setting. In many cases throughout film history these elements have amounted to something strange or just downright repugnant. Not here. Here, the combined efforts of the great Charles Laughton, the great Robert Mitchum, and the great Stanley Cortez all add up to a film so good that it's difficult to compliment it without simply regurgitating what other, more qualified people have already said before.\n\nSimply put, if you're an aspiring filmmaker looking to direct a thriller or a suspense tale, don't look to books or articles or pontification, but rather seek out two things as the models for how to properly tell a suspense story: the films of Alfred Hitchcock, and the film (singular) of Charles Laughton. This is a film so dark and strange that the whole affair's overall mystery rivals even that of its own antagonist. See it.",

All of the characters in this movie were extremely one dimensional, which was compounded by them breaking the fourth wall (often as they talked to God but it was really the audience) to explain their motives and feelings in the most simple and straightforward manner. Everything they did or wanted to do was projected so far in advance, and was usually so simple minded and obvious anyway, I felt a constant feeling of frustration as the movie progressed. The audience is never given a chance to think for themselves. Laughton's direction is heavy handed, with overdone set pieces and film school symbolism. The entire film lacks a sense of continuity, as if it were assembled in the cutting room from isolated takes where the director was feeding the actor's the lines as he wanted them to be read. I am a big fan of Mitchum, but here he feels stiff and unconvincing. Who would believe him for a second? The plot wouldn't move forward one inch unless it weren't filled with inane characters constantly making dumb decisions. If you want to see Mitchum evoke some convincing menace, rent Cape Fear.",

            "content": "Another movie whose classic reputation is strongly justified.\n\nRobert Mitchum is famously menacing in this movie. Mitchum had a special brand of menacing, with his eyes half-open, as if his sociopathy ran so deep, he could barely stay awake while he murdered you. His Reverend Powell is chillingly seamless in shifting from murderous threats to sonorous righteousness. Mitchum holds back his rage, always playing the long game, always in control of his emotions, always focused on his objective. Truly one of the great villains in movie history.\n\nBut Laughton's expressionistic style puts a bit of a Brechtian gloss on the immediate menace in the story. The beauty of the exquisite frame compositions belie the terrifying stakes of the story it's telling. It gives the viewer a chance to catch his breath, something few good thrillers let the viewer do (or if they do, it's to set up a boogeyman with a chainsaw around the next corner). The pacing is deliberate and patient, but never dragging. There is a reason few thrillers pace themselves in this way, and such pacing can easily backfire on a director. But happily, Laughton had enough faith in his vision to maintain its pacing, and it results in a unique cinematic experience.\n\nIn the end, all it took to defeat Reverend Powell is for someone to see him for what he is, and Lillian Gish's Rachel Cooper was such a person. One suspects that a real life Powell would have no problem overpowering an old woman half his size, and wouldn't depend on a little switchblade when looking into the barrel of a rifle. But this movie is part thriller, part allegory. The characters aren't realistic, they represent archetypes. I generally prefer movies about breathing humans rather than allegorical types, but this movie is so visually gorgeous and emotionally engrossing, it earns the latitude of figurative representation.\n\nIn one of her charming little homilies, Rachel Cooper sweetly asserts that \"Children abide.\" It's a comforting notion that hungry little children alone in the world manage to survive, that the Lord looks after children and drunks. But it's not true. Children starve all the time. That is a cold hard fact. Despite her assertions, Rachel knows that, which is why she unhesitatingly takes in two more children in need. She is the angel of this story. A quick glance around the world reveals that angels are in desperately short supply these days.",

A criminal malcontent disguised as a preacher goes on the hunt for some stolen loot, killing all who stand in his way, and there's your plot, but along the way Laughton  pauses to comment on many and various things, not the least of which is how a poetically told story resonates. Like maybe in the old silent films ... and there is where this simple tale takes joyous flight. Mitchum leads as the heavy, but there are many fine performances here. Shelley Winters, cast against type, is marvelous, and Lillian Gish ( in case you missed the homage to the silents) underlines the point.\nAnd, after all these years, still as vibrant a work.",

            "content": "Night of the Hunter is a film that I don't think I could explain in only a few sentences. The plot is not one I can sum up quickly (believe me I tried in the first couple drafts of this review.) It is a unique story that constantly keeps you guessing. There were several times during the movie where I thought I knew exactly where the story was going, and then they'd throw another curveball. The script is brilliantly crafted, because it takes you on an emotional roller coaster. The issue I have is that, at times the movie started to feel a bit long. Of course, then the story picked up again and I stopped worrying about it, but it's worth mentioning that there were moments where I felt the length. The other shortcoming of Night of the Hunter is that Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce are not very good child actors and they are the protagonists of the film. I certainly sympathized with their ordeal, and was particularly impacted by the emotional journey that John was taken on, but it just fell a little flat because their acting was so wooden.\n\nOn the flip side, Robert Mitchum was remarkable. He was absolutely terrifying, and sent shivers down my spine when he started talking about love and hate, or was \"speaking to God.\" Perhaps even more chilling was the use of traditional hymns, whenever he was approaching. Who would have thought \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\" could feel so unsettling? They did a great job at creating an atmosphere of potential danger. A big part of that came from Mitchum's performance, but there was also the music playing and the way they lit some of the scenes. I tensed up a number of times worried about what would happen to the kids. The conclusion was also quite good, and I loved Lillian Gish's character and what she added to the ending. Night of the Hunter was much darker than many movies of that era, and I understand that resulted in it struggling quite a bit at the box office. It's sad, because this is a very good movie, perhaps a bit ahead of its time, and I wish there were more like it. Unfortunately, I understand that the director was so discouraged by the struggles of The Night of the Hunter that he never directed another film. If you haven't seen this movie I would recommend it. While it does drag and is saddled with a couple lackluster child actors, it is otherwise a brilliant film that just might surprise you.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nAfter seeing this film twice, I never expected my opinion of the film to improve. I think it is because I decided to watch this at a time in my life where I genuinely felt like watching it, rather than forcing it upon myself, also time has allowed me to process my previous experience and during times of reflection allowed me to reconsider my previous feelings. Some of the issues I had with the film are still found during this third watch, and I doubt they would actually go away in my subsequent viewings. The improvements that I have found in this viewing are not leaps but rather minor hurdles that shifted my feelings towards this film from above average to good.\n\nThe Night of the Hunter's details the ideas of innocence, corruption, good vs evil, and of course, religion. The film's narrative is simple in its construction, which I felt was a flaw in previous viewings, but seeing it this time allowed me to understand the intentions of James Agee's script. It aims to appeal both its adult and young audiences about the importance of children and how the effect that the adults around impact their life; moments that emphasises these are found during between children-adult interactions, even the most minor ones, demonstrate a sense of depth in these children's souls, whether it may be a change in a child's facial expression or the physical distance they show towards the antagonistic adult figures.\n\nCharles Laughton, the film's director, handles the film's themes of innocence and corruption in such a way that lets it become universally accessible. He wants this film to be a source of inspiration for its audience about the importance of morality, resonating to the inner souls of its audience. This is most likely the reason why the film feels so stripped down in its storytelling and features basic characters with simple motives; when we reach in the hearts and spirits of its characters, what we find is nothing complex and different from what is already projected in their surfaces. I didn't mind the Laughton and Agee's approach in having these characters act as symbolic figures rather than genuine manifestations of humanity, as it allowed the film to be more than just a throwaway thriller or drama. That being said, Laughton and Agee did not completely forget to entertain its audiences, as it handles its antagonistic preacher with such darkness and terror that one cannot help but feel frightened, and the moments of thrill and action were delivered with a heightened sense of danger for the children, both at a physical and spiritual level.\n\nThe film starts itself off strong, but once the film hits near the end of its second half, after getting off the river, and then it starts to lose that disturbing and dire effect that was found in the first hour. The film at least redeems itself during the final 10 minutes of the film that wraps its thematic concerns and story effectively. The film was also paced quite swiftly during the former half of the film, breezing by its 40-50 minutes without a hiccup. This did leave certain scenes to feel a little rushed in its attempt to set the setting and its characters, but since this was my third viewing of this, it was not much of an issue.\n\nThe photography in this film is simply lovely to watch, with excellent use of shadows and light, that reflects well with its themes. I think if Laughton handled this film like a late coloured Hitchcock film, then this film would have been ineffective in drawing its audiences in to the film's dark heart. The film's musical score was for the most part great, but there were a couple of moments that felt forced in emphasising a certain aspect of the film.\n\nThe acting in this film was both hot and cold. I was impressed with Robert Mitchum and Shelley Winter's performance, but was ultimately disappointed with the child actors. It has been said that Laughton hated child actors, and refused to give them proper direction in regards to handling a scene, therefore that task was left for Mitchum to handle. I think this did affect the film's rhythm, contrasting heavily professional and amateurish performances. The children simply lacked the emotional impact that its adult actors were able to bring with their roles.\n\nThe Night of the Hunter is a strong film by Charles Laughton, and it is a shame that this was the only film he directed as the potential was certainly present when watching this. I recommend for everyone to at least give this a watch once.",

            "content": "Charles Laughton's only directive feature, The Night of the Hunter, is literally one of my all-time favorite movies whether it is watched on Halloween or not. In my opinion it has one of the most unforgettable haunting stories, a pretty good villain, especially when dealing with the likes of God and whatnot, and even at an hour and a half running time, I've never seen such a film be drawn out and have such unforgettable characters, their actions, the pacing, the timing, the suspense. It is one of the greatest movies that I think needs to be seen more and more by people every time it is watched. So what's the story?\n\nA father has stolen a vast sum of money and promises his kids John and Pearl to never tell anyone about the money and to keep it secret so that they can use it for future purposes. It isn't until they come across the villain supposed \"Reverend\" Harry Powell, who I will say is one of the best villains I've ever seen in a film, in fact, I can never tell if something other than him is controlling him, or if that's what he is entirely, but he is one of the greatest movie villains I've ever seen. He meets up with the family to get to the money but is only in it for the money. John and Pearl try very hard to protect what's rightfully theirs but once he finds out he kills their mother, jeesh, that's overkill, and chases after the kids to get the money. It isn't until they come across a motherly figure who takes care of them as they seek shelter there, and it's up to Jon and Pearl to make sure that the money isn't taken and that they're lives are spared.\n\nAs if I really need to tell you any more about this movie? This movie is simply a gem, but what's so scary about it? Well, the villain is the person who makes everything scary, and you know what taking a character who is just so despicable and so memorable that the film literally falls into place. I would be lying if I said it was scary, because it is in fact the film that I think has the least bit of scares out of all of the films, but, you know what, if it's scary because of that one character, that's all I need. This film I couldn't agree anything more or less. My favorite scene in the movie is when the villain and the woman trying to protect them are singing \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\". That right there is what got me into this movie, the theme. The white light shining to where the woman is and the dark night to where the villain outside is, it tells everything that is perfect in this movie, and I freakin' love that. \n\nAre there any problems? Well, considering that it was made in 1955 does it still hold up? The answer is yes, yes it does. The acting may be a bit outdated but, because the characters are so likable and so interesting, I can't judge the film THAT harshly. Yeah, some of the stuff is pretty obvious today, but, believe it or not, I could care less.\n\nThis film is perfect to watch all the time and I literally would be entranced by it every time it is seen. Everything in this movie is perfect, the characters, the actors, the music, but most importantly the theme of what this movie is supposed to be about. I can't wait until this movie is well known to more people and I certainly hope that people will be able to watch it and show it to their friends and whatnot.\n\nThe Night of the Hunter: Unmitigated classic, warming unforgettable characters.",

The Night of the Hunter is one of the few films that Agee has written for the screen. He has created a dark and haunting story of a man who go great lengths to attain the hidden money because the lord has told him so. I like characters like that, as what they are doing they is right. This is why I enjoyed A Clockwork Orange so much. My issue with the film's script is the third act and the parts leading up to it, which is after the barn scene. It did not have the fun and suspense that it did in the first half. The dialogue in this film are at times laughable because they seem almost ridiculous at times, not sure if intentionally or due to the actor's delivery of the line but it did disrupt the tone at times.\n\nThe only film that Charles Laughton has directed, and a good one for a debut. What he has created here is, for the most part, fantastic. At least for an hour and ten, the film has great suspense but the last half almost changes it's tone which didn't really work for me. I felt that it would have worked much better if the film was dark and horrific throughout but Laughton somewhat brought the tone down a bit with making it feel a little accessible to children. If the film throughout kept the dark tone then I think this would have been an excellent film.\n\nThis film feels very fast, the first hour in particular. I wished the film took it's time in fleshing out the characters and building up that tension. The boat and barn sequences are an example of the pace and tension that I wanted for the scenes preceding it. Laughton and Robert Goldem, the editor, should have slowed the film down and extended the running time a little bit more.\n\nStanley Cortez was the director of photography for this film, and let me say that this man's work in this was fantastic. I never thought black and white films could be so beautiful. There is a noir-ish sense in his photography here and it does add to the tension and horror of this story. Mitchum was already frightening as the preacher but adding Cortez's photography on top of it makes it much more spectacular.\n\nWalter Schumann's score in The Night of the Hunter does give off that horror sound but I felt it was a bit melodramatic, mostly because on the moments it chooses to come on screen. There are times where the score does hit an impactive note for me and those times, the scenes felt really frightening. If Schumann lived longer, he might have become a much more acclaimed composer.\n\nRobert Mitchum as the preacher is fantastic. If the supporting cast was just as good as his acting here then my rating for this film would be much different. The most frightening moments coming from him is when he just sits there and watches you or sings a tune. He doesn't overdo his role and at the same time not being pale and simple. Mitchum gave personality to this man and in the end result, it payed off. Shelley Winters is a good actress but like Lolita, she did not have enough screen time to show off her abilities, but when she is on screen she gives off this vulnerability and sadness; making her performance very believable. The child actors in the other hand are so-so, at times they're good and at times they are just a little bit over the top. I was able to power through it and not cringe every time they open their mouths. Billy Chapin though was the better one out of the other child actors in this. Lillian Gish isn't introduced in the story until later on in the film, she was fine with her performance but with the third act being a tad bit dull in it's execution, I couldn't really appreciate her acting as much.\n\nIf I watched this film when I was much younger and a little more innocent then this film would have been like a favorite of mine but since I grew up and my expectations and my perception of cinema has changed, then certain films like this one, may not be appreciated as much from me. Nevertheless, this film had some strong points but jest held back a bit by certain flaws. The film deserves to be watched alone for Mitchum's performance or Cortez's cinematography as both are powerful and horrific.",

The film tells the tale of two children whose father killed and robbed some people for 10,000 dollars, then left it with them after he was sentenced to death. While he was in prison, he met \"preacher\" Powell, who overhead him talking in his sleep about the money, and this sets the stage for the rest of the film, as Powell starts his ruthless quest to find that money. Charles Laughton directed this masterpiece, his only film as a director, and it's a shame he didn't direct more; he does an absolutely phenomenal job of portraying these kids in the light of goodness and innocence, while Powell dwells in the darkness of evil clothed in the light. There are shades of visual poetry, and truly astounding images that stand out among the best I've ever seen. It is honestly, a revolutionary film in American cinema, because new depths in darkness were reached, and visual poetry that America had never really seen. And all that combined with Robert Mitchum's terrifying portrayal of Harry Powell make for one of the best films of the fifties, and probably, of all time.",

A haunting portrait of good and evil, this film was deemed too avant garde at the time of its release, yet today it stands as the most well preserved productions of the fifties, and none of the power of its thematic representation of good and evil has been lost. Furthermore, Robert Mitchum in his preformance as the iconic preacher with 'love' and 'hate' tattooed on his hands is a powerful, sinister, cunning,  menacing presence; a performance worthy of praise.",

            "content": "Hmm, before I proceed with the review just saying I preferred the old system of having a percent bar for ratings but no matter! I proceed anyway.\n\nIt's no secret that Robert Mitchum and film noir go together like butter and bread, but this film takes him away from the role of the rough and ready but ultimately moral private dick or similar and shows him as Revered Harry Powell; a mentally unstable travelling preacher, obsessed with the concept of damnation.?On release the film was critically panned by critics, a move which dissuaded director Charles Laughton, from every sitting in the director's chair again. To be fair, there are some flaws. The music the film relies on I found jarring; Mitchum, while often seen as being amazing in the role now, I found to be far less sinister than people make out, and in fact there are moments in the film which are more akin to a slapstick comedy (shelf of jars landing on Mitchum's head). Other moments that make the film seem a bit too comical are immediately after that when Mitchum chases the two children protagonists up the stairs with arms as stiff as ironing boards.?On the whole however, there is more that redeems the film that detracts from it. The performances are stellar all round, even from the children, which is very rare. The films leading lady is killed off half way through, something which I haven't seen in any other film bar Hitchcock's 'Psycho'. Some of the camera shots are sublime, such as when the children are hiding in the barn, and you see the blacked out silhouette of Powell riding in the distance. Obviously, most of the violence is off screen with it being an old film, but don't forget how risky this film was to make, and just how big a gamble it was for Mitchum to star in. The role of a mad travelling priest, murdering widows and making off with their money could have destroyed his career. Plus, there are some really nice shots of the life on the river.?The message, to move onto my final point, is really emphasised by the end. When the evil Powell meets his polar opposite in Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish), an adoptive mother hen figure, who teaches forgiveness, selflessness and purity as opposed to Powell's damnation, greed and perversion of religion to justify his actions.?All in all, a good film, and due to modern sensibilities not being like what they were in the past, one you can watch with the whole family. Four stars.??Goodnight, \"Chilllll-drennnnn\"",

One particular underwater shot was unbelievable! Some other shots of various animals were really beautifully done as well. Gorgeous black & white photography and cinematography. And the acting by Robert Mitchum was really something else. He delivers a subtle, malevolent performance as the corrupt reverend-turned-serial killer; a true wolf in sheep's clothing. Definitely one of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen! I also liked how there was a biblical symbolism regarding the story of Moses; who was sought to be persecuted as a child, but escaped evil. The ending line summed it all up: ''You know, when you're little, you have more endurance than God is ever to grant you again. Children are man at his strongest. They abide.''

Robert Mitchum dominates every scene he's in and makes for an extremely menacing, sinister, and three-dimensional villain. Mitchum's character, Harry Powell is a reverend with a very dark agenda. He has the word \"HATE\" tattooed on the fingers of one hand and \"LOVE\" tattooed on the other and uses the two in an incredibly memorable scene where he explains how the two battle one another in life. The film is about two kids running from Powell as he pursues them for their inherited 10,000 dollars. So many themes and analogies are visited here including love and hate (of course), greed, and the most commonly known theme in the film industry: good and evil. It's rare to see a film use such themes this well. The cinematography is fantastic, particularly when the two kids are in a boat traveling down a river and the camera shows gorgeous shots of the animal presence in the river. The cinematography also helps Powell seem more menacing, as he's often shown as a towering and scary dark outline in the darkness. Also, the songs used in the film are creepy and perfectly match the mood of the scenes. If there's one single flaw with this film, it would be that the final showdown could have been a little stronger. Luckily, the positives of the film are so heavily on the positive side that it's difficult to give it anything less than a 10/10. The Night of the Hunter is one of the most impressive black and white films I've ever seen.",

The children are wise to Powell's nefarious deeds; something that leads to a long and winding chase. In addition to featuring one of Robert Mitchum's finest performances, Night of the Hunter is a masterwork of cinematic tension.

Its atrocious editing, strangely arch style, and awful, jarring use of music weaken it constantly. But it is also powerful and disturbing. \r\n\r\nIt must have been extremely shocking in its day, with its on-screen depiction of a mother having her throat slashed, followed by the killer stalking her two young children for miles, aiming to kill them, too. Rarely do movies put small children in this kind of mortal danger, much less drag it out for 30 grueling minutes. Watching a girl of about six struggle for her life at times made me feel like I couldn't breathe. \r\n\r\nIt took real guts for Robert Mitchum to take the role of this psycho. There was real potential for it to be a career killer. I suppose the only real casualty was Laughton, who never got another directing job. Mitchum continued to have a huge career, as did Shelley Winters, who plays the mother.\r\n\r\nNotable also is Lillian Gish, who pops up in the last half-hour and nearly steals the movie from Mitchum. It's a travesty that her performance wasn't heralded more. She should have won the Supporting Actress Oscar for her work as a gun-toting grandmother who is willing to protect children by any means necessary. The way she puts her body between the children and their would-be murderer is thrilling. And terrifying.",

It interestingly combines a good amount of seeming naivete with some really dark and disturbing material for its time period (1955). It tells a solid story with one of the best movie villains ever, and it has a really interesting visual style to boot.\n\nThe story, mostly told from the viewpoint of children, concerns a couple of kids who are terribly threatened by a thoroughly evil man during the Great Depression. The kids' father, who has recently been executed, had hidden a bunch of stolen money somewhere in their house. Knowledge of this situation prompts a bogus preacher (Robert Mitchum) to invade the kids' lives under a pretense of good will and piety. Frightening things develop from there.\n\nThe most famous part of this movie by far is Robert Mitchum's sinister performance as the evil preacher, a serial killer who hides behind the Bible and his own sermons (which he tells using tattoos which spell \"Love\" and \"Hate\" across his knuckles. Mitchum is utterly creepy and slithery in this role. It's a brilliant, by-now iconic performance. Shelley Winters plays the children's almost surreally gullible and pliant mother, while Lillian Gish turns up late in the movie as a fierce, genuinely faithful protector.\n\nThe movie was directed by Charles Laughton, better known as a bombastic actor in movies like Witness for the Prosecution and Mutiny on the Bounty. This was his only film as a director, sadly. His visual style is brilliant, especially for a first-time director. He uses a lot of weird set designs to make the interiors claustrophobic and scary. The sequence of the children boating down a river has a lot of striking, memorable imagery. A couple of other shots, particularly an underwater one, are especially amazing for the time. This is probably the best movie about child endangerment ever made.",

One thing that makes a villain so much more intriguing and scary is when we are never truly sure of what they are actually capable of, or how far they are willing to go.

            "content": "The Night of the Hunter follows serial killer/preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) as he romances widow Willa (Shelley Winters) so he can get his hands on money her late husband concealed somewhere on her property. Willa's daughter Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce) adores her new daddy; son John (Billy Chapin) is less enthused. Powell eventually kills Willa for being too sexy and tries to get the kids to divulge the location of the hidden cash. Pearl and John flee downriver to a neighboring town, where they are rescued by Rachel Cooper (Lillian Gish), a badass Depression-era foster mom with a shotgun. Powell shows up, Cooper shoots him, and she and her brood of orphans celebrate Christmas together in peace at The End (I love the way old movies announce The End when they're finished; do they think people might stay in their seats after the lights come up and wait for the next installment?).\n\nI adore The Night of the Hunter. The story's caught somewhere between fairy tale and nightmare does a great job of capturing the scary helplessness of childhood -- the way how, when you're a kid, your fate always seems to be in someone else's hands, frequently someone who doesn't seem any smarter or stronger than you. The lighting is gorgeous, the framing is gorgeous. The performances are stellar. You can't take your eyes off of Mitchum as Harry Powell, who has LOVE and HATE tattooed on his knuckles and not-very-subtly communicates his repressed sexual desires through the artful manipulation of a switchblade knife. And if only someone had thought of giving Lillian Gish a shotgun sooner.\n\nI've seen people complain about the obviousness and artificiality of The Night of the Hunter (IMDB message boards, you will never cease to amaze me), but if you're looking for realism, you're missing the point. The Night of the Hunter isn't subtle or realistic, it's not trying to be, and (this seems to be where a lot of modern audiences get lost) that doesn't make it bad. And though aspects of the film might seem a little affected or baldfaced to today's moviegoer, The Night of the Hunter deals with themes like sexual agency and religious hypocrisy in a nuanced, evenhanded way that a lot of modern movies still can't match. 4/5 to the movie as a whole and an honorary 5/5 to every scene containing both Lillian Gish and a shotgun.\n\ntheblackcatreviews.blogspot.ca",

            "content": "They May Endure, But Therapy Is Still a Good Idea  \r\n\r\nObviously, I first saw this film when I was taking that course about the American South in college.  Fall quarter, an article had come out called, \"Is There a Dead Mule In It?\"  The article speculated that the defining characteristic of Southern literature was the presence of a dead mule.  And indeed, as the school year progressed, our class began noting the dead mules which appeared in just about every book, short story, or essay we read--every movie we watched unto the documentaries.  And then, deep in the '30s, we came across this.  It is not merely an intensely Southern film; it is a clear example of the Southern Gothic.  And yet there is no dead mule to be seen.  We as a class puzzled over this for some time.  And then we came up with the solution, dubbed the Creepy Old Man Corollary to the Dead Mule Hypothesis of Southern Literature.  Namely, if no dead mule can be found but you still think it's Southern, look for the Creepy Old Man.\r\n\r\nBen Harper (a very young Peter Graves) has robbed a bank.  Killed two men while he was at it, and he's on the lam.  The police are in hot pursuit.  But he makes it home, and he hides the $10,000, and he makes his children--John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce)--swear that they will never tell where it is.  Only in his last days before his execution, his cellmate is Preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum).  Harry is in for thirty days for stealing a car, but he has also wooed and killed more than a few women, and he thinks getting the money out of Ben's widow, Willa (Shelley Winters), will enable him to build a tabernacle to the Lord.  Willa is a weak little thing, and she falls for Harry pretty much immediately, but John doesn't trust him even a little.  She is also afraid of raising her children alone as the children of an executed criminal.  And so she marries him, and it really doesn't go well for much of anyone.\r\n\r\nI think this movie--and presumably the book on which it is based--is scariest for people who remember what it is like to be a child.  The fear of this movie is only partially the fear of Robert Mitchum with a knife.  Really, the fear of this movie is an inherently childlike fear--the fear that people will not believe you when you try to tell them that there is something wrong.  Willa is willing to completely sublimate herself into what Harry wants from her.  Icey Spoon (Evelyn Varden) is the one who pressures her mother into being willing to get married, and it isn't until it is too late for the Harper family that her husband, Walt (Don Beddoe), is willing to say that he doesn't quite trust that Harry Powell.  Birdie Steptoe (James Gleason) might believe him, but he's a crazy old drunk (see above) and cannot help the children.  Billy Chapin was twelve, and John is a child explicitly given adult burdens.  He has sworn to protect Pearl with his life, and there is no one helping him.  Even Pearl is won over by Harry!\r\n\r\nThe casting in this movie is really superb.  Robert Mitchum exudes ominous sexuality.  Shelley Winters is only just barely prettier than average, and she always sort of exuded a wish that you would walk all over her.  When Willa goes to her death, Winters played her with an air of ecstatic sacrifice that I'm not sure any of the other suggested casting choices might have managed.  Lillian Gish as Rachel Cooper was cast specifically to remind us of the great silent era, wherein she was a symbol of staunch womanhood.  The first time I saw it, back in that class, we spoke with great admiration of how wonderful she is in the film's climax, standing guard over the children with a shotgun.  Even the children are cast well.  Sally Jane Bruce was seven, and this was her only feature.  While it is also true that the film is beautifully filmed and staged, the skillful cinematography and set design would have meant nothing without the cast.\r\n\r\nThe film was controversial in its release; well, it would be.  It was about a psychopathic preacher who married and then killed rich women.  It's also a hard film to categorize, which meant marketing wasn't easy even to people who weren't instructed from the pulpit to avoid it.  However, its weight in popular culture has only increased over the years.  Harry Powell's knuckle tattoos have been referenced in [i]Do the Right Thing[/i] and [i]The Simpsons[/i], among others.  (Of course, Sideshow Bob only has three fingers and a thumb and spells the words phonetically.)  Contrary to Robert Mitchum's claims, James Agee's script was the main basis for what appears onscreen, and between him and Charles Laughton (who was meticulous in his direction, again contrary to Mitchum), a great work of art was produced.  I can understand the people who were offended at the idea of a man of God who was so broken inside, but it's hardly as though the thing was unheard of even then.  All in all, it really is one of the greatest films of the 1950s, if not of all time.",

It is remiss of me not to mention Ms Gish by now; she is wonderful as she plays larger than life entrancingly and diminutively. It is the norm to bemoan the fact that the tortured homo that was Charles Laughton was discouraged and never made another film: I see it differently, for me the singularity of the work makes it all the more beautiful and valuable.",

Charles Laughton has directed a true classic with Robert Mitchum's finest performance. It's too bad that the film wasn't held up as the masterpiece it is at the time of its release.\r\n\r\nMitchum plays a traveling minister who learns of a fortune from a fellow inmate in jail.  When the minister leaves prison he heads out to find that fortune.  He follows the trail back to a widow (Shelley Winters), but her two children seem to know the most about it and the young boy is on to him.\r\n\r\nThe minister is brutal with the kids which leads to a them leave home and him chasing them throughtout the countryside.\r\n\r\nThe performances are spot on.  Mitchum is matched by the young Billy Chapin as the boy, John Harper.  The atmospheric storytelling sets the perfect dire mood and has been highly influential to filmmakers of today like the Coen Brothers, Terrence Malick, Martin Scorses, and David Lynch.\r\n\r\nThis film should not be missed by any true classic film fan.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v48/Zeppo1/NightoftheHunter.jpg[/IMG]",

            "content": "It's a brutal, unflinching thrill ride of grand proportions... by 1950s standards. I've always complained about that boring 1950s poster looking so boringly 1950s, especially when you compare it to these awesome newer posters and covers for the film, like that DVD cover of Robert Mitchum emerging from the shadows with his hands, labeled \"Love\" and \"Hate\", entangled, or the more recently unvelieved Criterion cover where he's holding a little girl, barely illuminated by white light, but really, the original, not so tense, poster fits, because this film hasn't made it out of the test of time unscathed, or at least that's what I thought when I went into this film. This film does get to be pretty intense, though it's still not quite what it used to be, because even the beautiful starlettes of the '50s aren't terribly great-looking by today's standards. Actually, they may not have been terribly great-looking by any time's standards, it's just that our taste in lovely-looking ladies of the screen fell fairly hard from about the '30s to sometime in the '60s, because Lillian Gish was pretty pretty back in the 1910s, and they messed her up pretty tremendously by this film. Granted, she was 62 when she did this film, but eitherway, the point is that the ladies of the '50s don't hold up terribly great today, nor does the effectiveness of the thrillers of the time. Still, again, this film does get to you at times, yet if all else fails, it's still got its other high points to keep you going. Still, with all of its occasionally still-fresh thrills and general likability, Robert Mitchum's character isn't the only thing that's off-putting in this film.\r\n\r\nAt a mere 93 minutes, this study on good and evil is a brief one, indeed, and, while it is relatively comfortable in its tightness, there are still quite a few points where this film makes sure that you don't forget just how short it really is. Mitchum's Reverend Harry Powell character's incarceration for stealing a car occupies the first couple of minutes of this film, and it's a very sloppy, uneven and hurried opening act that offers little in the way of exposition, and then finds itself tossed away as a notable point, as though it were superfluous, likely because it really was superfluous, never playing a part in the rest of the film. After that, things smooth out, yet only for so long before the film plummets right back into hurrying through exposition and meditation, thus hurting the effectiveness of the film, though not quite as thoroughly as, well, the dating. Other than that, it's the many tremendous lapses in subtlety, as well as moderate unevenness that further softens the tense blow of the film, and renders its should-be straight line of intrigue to run askew. The film takes quite the number of consecutive blows for the longest periods, something that a film simply can't afford to face at a runtime so brief, let alone when intrigue is conceptually written to be consistent throughout such a short length. In the end, the film falls flat, as underwhelming, and yet, through all of its missteps, it remains a sit that's rather worth having. Sure, it hasn't aged all that gracefully in the least (It got weak reviews upon initial release... you overly nostalgiac critics, so it probably was never all that effective to begin with), nor does it move all that comfortably, thus leaving it not as rewarding as it should be, yet what it does get right, it gets right in a fashion that was unconventional at the time and remains impressive to this day, with style certainly being among the batch of strengths that still hold up... reasonably well today.\r\n\r\nCinematographer Stanley Cortez's work is among the many aspects of the film that has dated, while some of director Charles Laughton's stylistic choices get to be a bit too strange, yet on the whole, this film pulled some then-highly unique touches that holds up today. The way Stan Cortez plays with the darkness within the scarce color often gives the film a rather bleak, claustrophobic fear, augmented by such stylistic choices as surrealistic emphasis on the tightness of spaces that really give the film a rather hypnotic dreamlike feel, yet does so in a way that's not too dry or dull. Granted, the immersive value of these stylistic choices are also dated, so they don't really hit home, in terms of tension, yet they do really capture the film's tones and themes in a very meditative fashion. By the end, intensity will not have hit home thoroughly enough for the film to stand as terribly satisfying, yet it's hard not to walk away from the film feeling that it, on the hold, did a decent job at selling its studies on good and evil, and how neither can be fully discerned through the outside of humans, as every person has his or her dark secrets. It's a message sold reasonably well through Charles Laughton's direction, yet most of all, through Robert Mitchum's uneasing and rewardind performance that's effectiveness may be hurt by the fact that much of the Reverend Harry Powell character is written and directed with a pronounced lack of subtlety or mystery, yet ultimately stands as quite possibly the most engaging aspects of the film. Mitchum incorporates his own classic touch of cool, smooth charisma, as well as a degree of nobility within his presence, thus making Powell believable as an unlikely suspect as a performer of the awful sins he commits. However, when these sins go unveiled, Mitchum's subtle, yet intense presence makes him just as believable as a disturbed and dangerous man, with flaws and mysteries that help greatly in carrying this film and making it an enjoyable experience, even with its general underwhelmingness.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the night, consistent tension is hurt by missteps in exposition - partially spawned from moments of extreme rushing -, as well as some unevenness and the occasional glaring lapse in subtlety, thus leaving the film to collapse as downright underwhelming, yet through general intrigue, intensified by some nifty stylistic choices and an uneasing, intense performance by Robert Mitchum, \"The Night of the Hunter\" still ultimately carries on as a generally engaging and, at times, reasonably thought-provoking classic piece within the thriller genre.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

This is his only film credited as a director, and it is a shame he didn't direct more, because this film is quite good.  It has an okay script, but it is the acting from Mitchum and the two children, as well as Laughton's fantastic somewhat expressionistic visual style that really make this a worthwhile film.  Admittedly it isn't the strongest film ever, but just look at the night time scenes with the kids in the little boat, beautifully shot.  It can venture into dark territory too, which was pretty toned down for the 50s audience, but there is something really haunting (and mesmerizing), about Shelley Winters dead at the bottom of that lake.

            "content": "\"The Night of the Hunter\" really starts to get involving halfway in, where it gets very good. Though the first half of the film is rather dull and stagnant, riddled with choppy editing, a thin soupy structure, awkward acting, and general lack of excitement, everything starts to kick into gear and work in the second half. \r\n\r\nThe film becomes louder and more sinister visually, with its atmospheric expressionist noir gorgeously creating a sense of nightmare and its uses of colors to display the general tones of good and evil. The themes also start to become more pertinent; at first, the film seems to lampoon religion, but by the end it's clear that \"NOTH\" is abiding by it and merely showing its good and evil aspects, ones concerning loving purity and open altruism or parasitic seduction and naive vengeance. \r\n\r\nI guess that the cheap-looking pastoral picture the first half paints was necessary for a more puissant turn in the story. The evil that tries to take over the lives of others and which uses God in a name of ersatz virtues would be \"Reverend\" Harry Powell, played so well by Robert Mitchum that it makes you jealous. \"NOTH\" is also a chilling display of the inexorable evil that is Powell. Driven by superficial greed and wants, Powell uses God to exonerate his own sins. It's a great moment when John, at the climactic ending of Powell's arrest, breaks in tears and rids his dead father's dirty money from his own possession, almost trying to force it into Harry's. A superb display of atonement and the purging of a vice he inherited from his father.\r\n\r\nI would find it extremely difficult to believe if \"NOTH\" did not serve as an influence for films such as \"Blue Velvet (contrast between dark underworld and mundane halcyon, ie good and evil)\" those of the Coen Brothers (inexorable evil,) \"Do The Right Thing (that one's a given)\" etc. \"NOTH\" is a quirky, highly stylized, morally mushy gem that pulls through.

The idea of a murderous preacher, an original idea that utilizes the option of something terrifying in plain and unobvious sight, is a brilliant idea, and most of the time you donâ(TM)t really see Mitchum, you see his shadow, in the style of a demonic force following you at every turn. At one point the child actor says of Powell as he chases them âDoesnâ(TM)t he ever sleep?!â? And you can easily believe he wouldnâ(TM)t. Powell is the original Terminator, a frightening depiction of pure evil by Mitchum, and I am actually struggling to think of a villain with as much screen presence as this character, beating maybe even The Terminator and The Joker (Heath Ledger).\n\nThis is a film that flies by, with some magnificent camera angles and use of shadow, as well as a lovely scene where you see animal life living normally as the children float by on the river in the background.

The film's unusual mise-en-scene with its odd camera angles and stark lighting create an atmosphere of dread and foreboding.  However, Robert Mitchum's greatest performance as the evil preacher with LOVE and HATE tattooed on his knuckles relentlessly pursuing the defenseless children while singing \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\" makes the film one of the most disturbing ever made.

Alright, taking it from the top. There was a man who robbed a bank, and before they took him away, he put the loot in his daughter's doll for safekeeping. Unfortunately, the fella goes and tells his cellmate, played by a real slick,mysogynist Robert Mitchum, who gets out of jail, courts and marries the doomed man's wife, and kids, putting himself off as a preacher, but always having his eye on the big prize. What those poor children went through was sad indeed, but thank God for those who look out for them. One of the very best in American cinema. What I like about it is the many themes that play here, yet somehow they come together in a nice tidy bow as this movie. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

            "content": "On one end you have the manipulative preacher Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), on the other the benevolent and wonderful Rachel Cooper. Together they do battle in a metaphor as fitting for the time as any you could conceive. One, Harry Powell represents hate although as the movie suggests it comes looking much like love in many instances. It's written on the preachers knuckles, love on one and hate on the other, he explains that although hate my rise up, love will always conquer it. We learn how aptly this metaphor is displayed by the end of the movie. It's triumphant and compelling and not just just for 1955. You have to wonder just how many movies have been influenced by Night Of The Hunter, (my bet is all of them).\n\nHarry Powell, played impeccably by Robert Mitchum acts a bogus preacher who lands in jail after stealing a car, he meets up with Ben Harper, a man who's about to be put to death. Ben Harper lets Harry know of ten thousand dollars he has hidden, although the only ones who know its location are his children. Harry Powell then takes initiative and seduces Ben Harper's gullible widow, acting with charm and charisma, wooing his way into not only Mrs. Harpers heart but into the heart of all the townspeople, (the final mob scene is a sight to behold). He finds however that the children of Ben Harper are not so easily fooled. The youngest boy, John Harper withholds all information from Mr. Powell and it builds towards an intense battle of wills that proves to be indelibly haunting. Mr. Powells chillllllldren, call from the top of the stairs is blood curdling in it's own right.\n\nDirector Charles Laughton went on to direct more films but none as visually appealing and suspenseful as Night of the Hunter. One of the most striking aspects about this film is how well it holds up to today's standards in terms of story, visuals and overall entertainment. It's horrifying and welcoming at the same time, the scene where Willa Harper is sunk under water in the old model T is one of the most haunting scenes in all of cinema. It has beauty but for all intensive purposes it's visually frightening. Night of the Hunter has surpassed the standard for what It means to be a classic, (hell it was even recognized by congress as being culturally significant), not that it truly matters, what does is a well written, well acted story about what happens when love and hate collide. Sometimes we have trouble telling the difference, but eventually as the movie suggests hate is toppled and defeated.",

The 50's was the era of conservatism and this film was one of the first to push the thriller genre to another level. It wasn't as highly regarded when it was released as it is now from my understanding. And it's somewhat easy is to understand because there is a great deal of realism to the film. Mitchum is perfect as the charismatic but evil preacher hell bent on recovering some money that a thief in prison has stashed away. The target is the thieves family. Unsure of just where the money is, the preacher marries the widow and tries to befriend the children. Only John is suspicious of The Preachers real motives and defies him at every turn. Things take a turn for the worse when the widow discovers that The Preacher is after the money. After that, it comes down to a battle of good vs evil in this sometimes dark, but sometimes oddly upbeat thriller.\r\n\r\nAnd that's the thing. The direction is tight and precise, and the film looks great. For a good bit of the running time it's spooky and dark... Very much like Cape Fear, which is similar in someways. But other times it's oddly upbeat and more reflective of the innocence of the times. For many this wouldn't be a big deal, but I wish the movie would been more darker.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------",

Whether you like or hate the movie, you will remember one thing until the day you die: Robert Mitchum as Preacher Harry Powell. He is the embodiment of (as the movie puts it) a wolf in sheep's clothing. He is deceptively polite and extremely unnerving. He gets the trust of everyone in the community and that's a scary thing to have, especially if you're a little boy with a big secret (Billy Chapin, who's a convincing child actor here). The other thing you will remember is the cinematography; exaggerated and expressionist. It delicately adds to the tension and humor of the film and I'm not surprised that director of photography Stanley Cortez worked with Orson Welles.\n\nI know this movie has a few problems. I wonder how Willa Harper (Shelley Winters) is so hypnotized by Powell. I wonder why Rachel Cooper (Lillan Gish) is such a strong character, yet only shows up in the last third of the movie. I know there are a few acting moments that people may consider \"silly.\" But during every single second of The Night of the Hunter, I am memorized. I'm enthralled with the cinematography, the tension, and Mitchum's unforgettable performance.",

            "content": "The Night of the Hunter is a fable. The entire movie plays like some Biblical parable for the morals of good and evil; its plot is a stretched allegory for testing the righteousness and innocence of children; it's characters are archetypes of archetypes, and its dialogue, from the Big Bad Wolf references to the crown of thorns, is gratuitous to the ears. Sometimes there are unique ways in which a story can be told (through film, books, conversation, art, etc.). Director Charles Laughton sought to tell a Grim-fairy tale in a movie that would've worked far better with Rankin Bass puppets. \n\nI reinforce; I recognized the craft that makes this film so lauded but I am not one to agree with it, nor was I entirely convinced by the effect of Laughton's garish filmmaking techniques. For one, the man does not seem to know the definition of subtlety, and there's hardly a moment that IS subtle in The Night of the Hunter. From the moment the film commences there's a booming, orchestral piece that dictates the tone of the film. We're introduced rather quickly to Robert Mitchum playing the existential false prophet Harry Powell. It's an absurd performance, harrowing on the visual menace of the character's bellowing voice and penchant for breaking into psalms. There are later roles in Hollywood which would imitate Mitchum's Powell (Jim Carrey's Count Olaf comes to immediate mind)--and they all share the villainous lunacy of it all. The common folk whom Powell fraternizes must have the brain capacity of goldfish not to realize that Powell's a dirty scoundrel. I can't say that the children are any wiser--I mean the youngest girl, Pearl, fretfully forgets her fear of Powell even after he threatens to snap her arm in twain. Later in the film there is the spurring young Ruby who is seduced by Powell's charisma. With children being tricked and adults ignorantly blind, are young 9 year olds, like Johnny Harper, the only beings with sleuthing inclinations as to Powell's malevolence? Apparently so; the townsfolk seem too dimwitted to call the police when Johnny's mother Willa goes missing (Ben Harper warned his children in the beginning of the film that his wife was \"none too smart\"--but I think he meant EVERYBODY in the fucking film)\n\nBesides getting a good laugh out of Robert Mitchum arm wrestling himself, there comes with every onscreen appearance of the dastardly devil a raucous brass-section that is so unbelievably corny that I had to stop and wonder if the composer and director ever saw eye-to-eye. I suppose everybody but Johnny is deaf and so they don't hear the music; certainly his mother Willa hasn't a pair of functioning eyes or ears for she marries the prophet with the lustful speed of a high school freshman girl. And when Willa interferes with Powell's agenda, she is disposed of in perhaps the most ridiculous and preposterous method ever laid to film (ie: There is a moment where Johnny wakes in the night because the car is so FUCKING loud but he just shrugs, smiles, and goes to sleep. Talk about shitty character development; the boy is SO suspicious about everything except for when his own mother is getting murdered). Alas, Powell's patience with his two new children wanes, and they embark on a maritime odyssey down a dark and symbolic river that just serves to ham up the insurmountable symbolism that this film already has. \n\nIn true Biblical fashion--and fairy tale style--their \"skiff\" drifts into the bosom of a friendly woman who takes in lost orphans (and filling in the Grandmotherly archetype). I suppose in the time frame that this film is set, there's nothing unusual about orphaned children under the care of a gregarious woman and for a moment the solace these children find is truly enjoyable. It's just when Mitchum pops up onscreen again--seducing Ruby and SOMEHOW knowing her name--that the film's attempt at redemption, characterization, solemnity, peace, and logic are cast into a melting pot. At least the motherly woman caring for Johnny and Pearl had instinct to recognize Powell as a seedy bastard but she hadn't the brains to call the police BEFORE he invaded her house. Alas, the \"big bad wolf\" retreats into the barn and is caught like a vicious animal in the anti-climatic finale. \n\nThe Night of the Hunter is perhaps the silliest black & white film I have seen for the mere sake that it prides itself in overflowing, gratuitous symbolism and never sets to establish any sort of median for what is real or fake. Yes, there are films with suspension of disbelief (E.T. for instance), but this is not one of them. Furthermore do I not buy the \"fairy tale\" approach; that's a poor alibi for lauding this film. It may have worked better with stop motion animation, 2D animation, or even Rankin Bass Puppets, but for a film that looks visually uncanny to To Kill a Mockingbird (or the myriad of other films released in the 50's time frame), I just couldn't buy any of it. ESPECIALLY Robert Mitchum arm-wrestling himself in a sodapop parlor; are they sure that wasn't stock footage accidentally placed into the film?",

Some of these scenes are shot so well that you cannot help but be saddened by the fact that we cannot see future work by the director. If Laughton was given more films to really let his abilities mature, then this film would be looked at as an early piece from a great American auteur, rather than an odd departure for a respected actor.\nIt is an odd film. The tone often vacillates between sweetness and sheer terror. Which is quite an accomplishment considering Mitchum's complex character. While we're on the subject of Mitchum, I cannot imagine another actor pulling off such a larger than life villain, without it seeming way too over the top. Mitchum just makes it look easy.\nIt may be an odd film, but I think it is the oddity that gives it originality. With originality comes the risk of turning off the masses. Yet,  this film should not be looked at as a failure by any means even though it didn't rake in lots of money. It is a thoroughly impressive debut feature and a brief glimpse into what could have been a long, illustrious directing career, had money not gotten in the way.",

            "content": "James Agee has done here what I also thought was interesting about The African Queen: he criticizes old fashioned Christians who don't truly think things through. I feel like if it wasn't for the woman that Willa Harper works with at Scoops she wouldn't have even considered marrying Harry Powell. The woman tells her that it's not right to leave these children without a dad. That's not the way God wanted it to be, and it's not like her first marriage was actually real anyway. The good old-fashioned Christian belief that if a person did one bad act then it's black and white; that person is just plain bad. This woman contrasts with Rachel Cooper, the woman who took these kids in after finding them on a boat and takes care of them. There's a scene when Ruby comes home and says she hasn't been to sewing lessons on Thursday, but instead was with men. Rachel holds her saying it's okay, she was just looking for love in all the worst ways she knew. She understands and forgives her and takes care of her. The woman at Scoops would have turned her away, while Rachel continues to love her as her own. This is just a side story that goes along with the main story of Harry Powell coming to town to marry Willa Harper and find the money her husband stole. You see, Harry goes out and marries widows then kills them for their money. Harry killed Ben while in prison in order to get the money. But only John and Pearl know where the money's hidden. Ben didn't tell Willa because she didn't have the common sense John had. We know this to be very true. She's stupid in going out and marrying a guy that is nothing like her. She just does what everyone tells her to do. She's easily manipulated. It wasn't too hard to disconnect ourselves from her and want the children to get the heck out of there. I also found it interesting that this is probably the first film to use religious songs in an eery way. Whenever Harry is around the children hear him sing hymns. Church hymns are used as a warning sign. Pretty interesting. One of my favorite scenes comes when Rachel sits at her window with a shotgun keeping an eye on Harry as he sits on a tree stump and sings a hymn. The only other time I enjoyed such a complex killer was in Fritz Lang's M. And the actors who played John and Pearl are great. The only thing I would say didn't work too well was the way they show things to the audience then still have the character say something to make sure the symbol wasn't lost. And John crying when he sees Harry get arrested was a little much. It was a good idea, but I felt like it came out of nowhere. Laughton tried to keep it connected by having John grab his chest when his father was arrested then have him grab his chest again when Harry's arrested, but it still wasn't enough. However, this film drew me in so much and I was surprised by the darkness it had. Laughton was only credited with directing The Night of the Hunter and it's a shame that he didn't do more. Mitchum said he was his favorite director. I wonder what it would have been like if he did more?",

I really liked Lilain Gelsh's performance, not very keen on Mitchum's, but then again it was not really that hard of a role, he did deliver some really scary scenes. The Film is actually pretty scary in the sense that it would probably make a lot of people feel insecure because it focuses on a religious leader gone mad, Guess that's what happens with fanatics. The film has a couple of moments where I thought about religion, not necessarily the bad parts of it, the good parts, which are incredibly rare. Charity is something I saw but then again that has nothing to do with religion, when the kids are taken in. It's a great movie, it's scary, it's well acted from most of the cast, it's haunting, it's short and sleek and to the point, and it's just flat out a well made film.",

            "content": "Charles Laughton's only directorial feature was the gothic fairytale The Night of the Hunter. The film follows Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum), an independent preacher and psychotic zealot with the words LOVE and HATE iconically tattooed on his knuckles. When Powell establishes himself in the lives of a widow (Shelley Winters) whose late husband stashed $10,000 in an unknown location, he becomes obsessed in finding the location of the money. The only people in the world who know where the money is are the woman's two young children: John (Billy Chapin) and Pearl (Sally Jane Bruce). Powell will go to such lengths to obtain the money as murder. The brilliant execution of the story is masterful. Laughton's direction is at once lyrical and twisted, macabre and pastoral; it's impossible to tell that it was his directorial debut. The cast is uniformly excellent, breathing life into a morbid tale, but best of all is Robert Mitchum, whose wicked performance as the serial killing preacher is one of the most chilling of all time. In her limited screen time, Winters crafts a deeply disturbed woman who tricks herself into religious zealousness after marrying Powell. The two children--especially Chapin, who played John--are excellent, possibly standing as two of the finest child performances ever. And lastly, screen legend Lillian Gish, whose character is a lone beam of light in a world proven to be dark, vicious, and cruel, delivers a heart-rending, beautiful performance. The Night of the Hunter is an absolute masterpiece, in every sense.",

This is one of my very favorite movies, and it is a creepy masterpiece.  The whole entire film, there's this unshakable feeling of imminent danger, as you are really nervous for these two kids.  This feeling is made possible because 1. it lets you know in the first act that it is the type of movie that is not afraid to pull some punches, and 2. the dominating performance given by Robert Mitchum.  He is a bullshit artist to the nth degree, misusing people's trust in his religious cover for classic misdirection, and whenever he is talking, you cannot take your eyes off of him.  There's really good shadow play with some fantastically done lighting, and whenever people are singing, it's so damn creepy, even when it's an innocent enough song.

            "content": "\"The Night of  the Hunter\" is easily one of the most underrated movies of the 1950s. One could criticize that with a title like that, the story can only come off as foreseen and formulaic. Don't let some of the presumptions fool you, not even the obviously fake car ride and jerky steering done by Robert Mitchum in the beginning. And although I will agree the story is a little predictable at times, that doesn't stop me from admitting I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I was going to. It's just great to look at. The actual look of the film and beautiful restoration(done by the Criterion Collection in some additions), makes it a joy to watch, and easy to watch. For me it was hard to take my eyes off the screen. The broad shots in the beginning of the movie mixed with the thick black and white texture made it seem rich, which is strange to say coming from a black and white movie. Certain other shots looked marvelous and sometimes chilling. Towards the middle of the movie, there's a scene where John and Pearl are resting in a barn. The next thing they know they hear the eerie hymn(or lullaby), of the sinister Preacher, Harry Powell, played by Mitchum. The way the shot is set up(we see a clear white skylight as the sun comes up and soon approaches Mitchum on his horse), is impeccable and ahead of it's time. It makes me wonder how this movie didn't get an Academy Award nomination for cinematography, or at least one for Mitchum. That brings me to the performances. We all know Mitchum stole the show, that's a given. To me his performance has just the same intensity and momentum that Henry Fonda's evil \"Frank\" from \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" did. Mitchum plays a Preacher, a \"man of God.\" Or so, he believes. His character thinks that every thing he does, big for little, is driven by God's word. Sort of like he's the messenger. However, what we actually DO see him do it quite the opposite of a righteous man. It's eminent from the very beginning when we see him get arrest for stealing a car, that he is up to no good. He has a short fuse, a bad temper, and an iconic switchblade that he flips that he claims he uses on \"meddlers.\" Yet when we see Mitchum from behind, or alongside townspeople singing, \"Bringin in the Sheaves,\" he looks just like a harmless Preacher, sent out from God after the death of John and Pearl's father. What we later learn is that he's only out to get the money he found out after sharing a cell with their father in jail. I think the Preacher's evil comes off so great due to both Mitchum's performance, and the direction. There's a particular scene where John and Pearlâ(TM)s mother is talking to her friend about how she urges for some sort of redemption, or sign from God to sweep her off her feet and forgive her for ever loving a bad man. What we instantly see next is a large black train coming towards the camera with a booming score that intertwines. This let's us know that: He's here. The Preacher quickly gets the support of the town, and uses his word of God to cover up for any sort of crimes. He even ironically sings several times in the film a song about being safe and secure from all harm. This is ironic because he practically embodies evil and causes the most harm in the movie, yet his character can get away with chanting such joyful and uplifting songs. It's unsettling. Another powerful scene I liked was when the kids are sitting around their new savior, listening to her read a story from the Bible. John leaves the room because he can't stand to hear more \"holy words\" quotes from such a praised source. Heâ(TM)s got it stuck in his head that the Bible and word of God are evil-due to how the Preacher used it wrongly and messed with his values. This is great writing as well. Eventually the kids don't buy it though, and this to me was probably one of the better movies to depict grown-ups and step-fathers from a kid's point of view. Although their acting wasn't the best, it was surely passable and, you know their kids, so when are you ever believable as a kid? They're no Jem and Scout but then again this is a more serious and even deadly type of story. Dealing with religion, and uncertainty, and definitely blindness. In the end, the kids find security in an old and wise lady who takes care of several other lost souls. It's quite moving and obviously biblical--countering the evil we were following the entire stretch of the film up to this point. It wraps up pretty fast, actually a lot faster than I expected. If there was one major gripe I had about the film it was not showing the end of the Preacher, but then again I guess the movie isn't about him--it's about the kids so, fair enough. \"The Night of the Hunter\" is the film to watch if your looking for the mixture between a great classic(comparable to \"To Kill A Mockingbird\"), and a just right enjoyable movie.",

            "content": "For 1955, Night Of The Hunter is a spectacular piece of filmmaking that really paved the way for future psychopath films. For 2011, however, I feel like this film has simply not held up as well as I would like.\r\n\r\nThe really big problem with this film is the fact that it involved a man trying to hunt down a pair of children. Why is this a problem? For the same reason why I am never scared by a movie that features children in peril. Why? Because I've never seen a child murdered or eaten or smashed by a boulder on screen before. What it comes down to is a great fallacy in filmmakers' thinking where they think that an audience will fear for a child's life automatically. The problem is that many filmmakers lack the guts to actually *kill* a child. And when I was seven and watching Jurassic Park, I didn't know that, and that film worked (and the children *did* get hurt quite a bit in that film). But by the time I saw  The Exorcist, Aliens, Dante's Peak, 2012, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, A Beautiful Mind, Crash, every Harry Potter, The Hills Have Eyes, Leon the Professional, Mrs. Miniver, and The Shining, I started to realize something. Filmmakers don't have a problem putting children in front of the gun, but they have a major issue with pulling the trigger. And they should. Our psyche naturally doesn't want to see a child get hurt, even in a film. That's why only a very small number of films has had the gall to kill off characters under the age of sixteen (like Pan's Labyrinth). And, anyway, once the children have been outrunning the killer for a good twenty minutes, it becomes obvious that they are going to live to see the end credits. To be frank, this whole issue really bothered me. Night Of The Hunter became a chase film instead of really adding to the drama. And that's when I thought the film started to overstay its welcome. I couldn't buy that these kids were in any real danger and I didn't believe that I had to be scared for them.\r\n\r\nThat being said, this is still a very well-done picture, and its only real issues stem from the fact that it has not aged as well as I would have liked. But back in 1955, this would have been an astonishingly good picture. Unfortunately, due to bad reception from audiences and critics upon its original release, Charles Laughton (who directed this film) never directed another picture. And that's a real shame. Laughton was obviously an excellent director. What he does with imagery and shadows and staging has been compared with German Expressionism films, and I could definitely see the connection. I think that's the main reason why people have found this films so eerie over the years. It's stylishly directed and very well put together, even if I didn't find it as effective as I would have liked.\r\n\r\nI also want to applaud all the actors who worked on this film, especially the children. The films I have seen recently to feature child actors made awful choices. So many child actors are chosen because they look cute or something to that effect. It was great to see two kids (Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce) who could really, truly act well. I became invested in their performances and in their characters, and because of that, a lot of the drama concerning them really worked well. But of course Robert Mitchum, the star of Night Of The Hunter, gave a truly wonderful performance. He played a very manipulative character while keeping the essence of his insanity alive. He was charming, yet dangerous. Now, I will say that I wasn't always sure if I could side with the characters who thought it was completely innocent, because I never thought his character was quite kind enough. Don't get me wrong, it's a great character to watch, but I thought more could have been done to make him seem kind and welcoming rather than just plain menacing, rather more like Anthony Hopkins in Silence Of The Lambs.\r\n\r\nSo, I cannot say that I thought Night Of The Hunter was a great film. It's well shot and well directed. I adored the cinematography and enjoyed the dialogue. But I had some major problems with the plot more than anything else. Plus, I was a little let down by the ending. I almost thought the ending was a bit anti-climactic. Still, I would recommend Night Of The Hunter to my fellow film fanatics.\r\n7/10",

The kids are really good,the widow is gullible and it sucks to see her being used for greed,the father I feel bad for,while he killed someone,when he's looking out of iron bars.Everyone I felt genuinely sorry for (when the script wanted me to feel sorry for them).And I felt happy when they where having fun (and jealous since I have spine problems and I can't play).Overall,these characters are outstanding and one of them evil and I need a new TV as a result.Damn it..\r\n\r\nThe dialogue is something I'd like to comment on.Just,trust me when I say this movie has quite a bit of preaching in it,but it contributes to the plot,even if it gets kinda annoying.I take no points off since I dunno if this was common in 1955.If it was,then my gut was right.If not,then I shall punch my gut and most likely have a stomachache for a few hours.But other than that,the dialogue is delivered very well and it's all written incredibly well.Horray for no stupid lines that are delivered like they where being delivered from a 1 year old!!!\r\n\r\nTo sum things up,The Night of the Hunter is an incredibly well written,brilliantly acted and directed,and magnificent piece of cinema.Everything about is enough for me to call it a masterpiece.The only thing that I could \"complain\" about was that it lost me every now and then,but I got back on track very quickly.I recommend you watch this movie if you haven't.I swear you will not be disappointed by it.It is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.I give The Night of the Hunter a perfect 10/10!",

            "content": "Night of the Hunter is one of cinema's greatest told stories to grace the screen. There is no misunderstanding about why it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in its National Film Registry. It is shot in black and white so it is older (1955), but nonetheless it is a fantastically told story of good american moral, innocence,  and yes Evil...true, true evil oh lord! \r\n\r\nNight of the Hunter is loosely based on the true story of Harry Powers aka The Lonely Hearts killer who killed two widows and three children. One of the movies strong points is the sadistic character of Harry Powell played by Robert Mitchum. A holy man who is definitely \"driven\" by the lord. \r\n\r\nThe real story begins when a man shows up at his farm home after robbing a bank. Before he is apprehended by the law he gives his boy John $10,000 and tells him to hide the money and never tell anyone where it is. \r\n\r\nIt just so happens that the boy's father goes to prison and meets Harry Powell (Robert Mitchum) who becomes his cellmate. Before the boys father is hanged to death, he tells Powell about the $10,000. After Powell is released from prison he heads seeks the $10,000 which leads him to wooeing a whole family of religious people and marrying their daughter Willa (Shelley Winters) who he brainwashes with the fear of the lord. \r\n\r\nAll of this is in effort to get closer to his true ulterior motive; to get John and his sister pearl alone and threaten them with a switch blade to tell him where the money is! Mitchum is kind of scary sometimes as he transforms from preacher to evil creep. \r\nJohn and Pearl end up leaving in their uncle's boat and travel down the river where they are still pursued endlessly by the money hungry evil preacher. Timeless stuff. \r\n\r\nThe movie is a bit long, but it is worth it. It really is one of those classical era pieces that captures so much within its running time. The metaphors of good and evil throughout the film make it really eye catching. The preacher almost poses as the devil as where Rachel Cooper played by Lillian Gish poses as the salvation for the children and almost a form of god. The characters are all very classic and the character of Powell has become a cultural media icon with his \"Love\" and \"hate\" tatoos on his knuckles. Mitchum's Powell was ranked No. 29 in the villains column in AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains.",

            "content": "Charles Laughton's \"The Night of the Hunter'' is one of the most instantly memorable films you'll ever see, but has never received the attention it deserves because of its lack of the proper trappings. Many memorable films are by great directors, but Laughton directed only this one film, which was a critical and commercial failure long overshadowed by his acting career. Many memorable movies use actors who come draped in respectability and prestige, but Robert Mitchum (who is excellent here, as usual) has always been a raffish outsider. And memorable movies are realistic, but \"Night of the Hunter'' is an expressionistic oddity, telling its chilling story through visual fantasy. People don't know how to categorize it, so they leave it off their lists. That inability to define it is, to me, its greatest quality.\n\nIts compelling, perplexing, frightening and beautiful all at the same time. Many films from the mid-1950s, even the good ones, seem somewhat dated now, but by setting his story in an invented movie world outside conventional realism, Laughton gave it a timelessness. Yes, the movie takes place in a small town on the banks of a river. But the town looks as artificial as a Christmas card scene, the family's house with its strange angles inside and out looks too small to live in, and the river becomes a set so obviously artificial it could have been built for a completely stylized studio film.\n\nThe shot of Shelley Winters at the bottom of the river is one of several remarkable images in the movie, which was photographed in black and white by Stanley Cortez, who shot Welles' \"The Magnificent Ambersons,\" and once observed he was \"always chosen to shoot weird things.'' (that shot, also, is among the greatest shots I have ever seen, hands down). There's also a frightening composition that shows a street lamp casting Mitchum's terrifying shadow on the walls of the children's bedroom. The basement sequence combines terror and humor, as when the Preacher tries to chase the children up the stairs, only to trip, fall, recover, lunge and catch his fingers in the door. And the masterful nighttime river sequence uses giant foregrounds of natural details, like frogs and spider webs, to underline a kind of biblical progression as the children drift to eventual safety. Also, I have to finish by commenting on the brilliant casting choice of Lillian Gish (she herself a cinematic figure of biblical proportions. You can analyze the role of her character all day long, and she is just another example of how compelling this film truly is.",

But this, The Night of the Hunter, who would want to bash it? It's fabulous! Just brilliant! I ain't got a single bad thing to say about it.\r\n\r\nIt's about a guy who robs a bank and kills two people in the process, stealing $10,000 (obviously a lot of money in the 50s xD) to secure a good future for his kids, John and Pearl. Before he's caught he manages to hide the money and make his kids promise never to tell anyone, not even their mother, where the money is hid. Before he is hanged a shifty con-man named Harry Powell who pretends to be a preacher shares a cell with him and hears about the money and when he is released sets out to find it.\r\n\r\nThe film is just perfect, Robert Mitchum plays Harry Powell so well! He just makes your skin crawl and makes you laugh at the same time, I must say he is one of the best villains I've ever seen portrayed on screen. The way he stalks the children trying to find the money whilst everyone trusts him because he's a preacher is just horrifying. The little gospel song he sings is sure to resonate with you and even give you nightmares, and his metaphorical \"Ol' Right Hand, Left Hand\" story explaining why he, a supposed preacher, has \"LOVE\" and \"HATE\" tattooed on his fingers like some kind of ex-con is both hilarious and thought provoking.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is just brilliant, they use these great long shots with minimal lighting that comes up from below creating huge scary shadows. Many of the scenes look like something out of the evil part of a fairytale. So many scenes in this film will forever be embedded in your memory banks, I just wanna talk about all of them but I won't because I don't wanna make the review too long and some of them would contain spoilers.\r\n\r\nThis may be one of the greatest thrillers I've ever seen, but it's not just a thriller it's so much more, it's just so wonderfully deep. It's loaded with social commentaries and is one of the most clever examinations of good and evil I've ever seen and the innocence of children is examined so gracefully you could even class this as a bit of a coming-of-age film, it's a truly entrancing and intelligent work of art.\r\n\r\nThis film is a must see for all cinephiles. 5 stars from me",

He really nails the role, it's over-the-top but you can't imagine his performance being anything else. One draw-back of the film is the character's aren't as well-etched out as you hoped. Some of their motivations are rather vague however this may be due to the time period in which it was made rather than the fault of the script.

As art goes, this is it, story informed by the director's eye, and heart.

The word delicious is so clichÃ (C) these days, but this visual feast is intoxicating, a journey into subconsciousness and the liminal, with the awakeness of wide-eyed children, into the past, and grounded in the present, satire and humor collide with bedtime-story grandeur, it is in the very best way that I like to have a movie, to be like a dream. A marvel and a treasure, I solemnly invoke and pronounce eternal worship of this almighty representation. Watch it with the kiddies on Christmas eve, it is, after all, a Christmas film, and about children. Truly a gem to discover and keep discovering.

Robert Mitchum is truly creepy and very convincing as the unstable \"preacher\" who kills windows to steal their money. Also, Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce who play the children, John and Pearl, are astounding. This is especially true of Billy Chapin who, I swear, out-acts Mitchum AND Shelly Winters in many scenes.\n\nWhich brings me to the crux of why I think The Night of the Hunter doesn't age well. Young Billy Chapin is the most reserved, subtle actor in this movie. Everyone else insanely over-acts. While it kinda works in Mitchum's case, having every single character be so on the nose with every emotion they're supposed to feel makes for an exhausting film that comes off more of a theatrical production--or even a cartoon--than a thriller. The music, which is overbearing in some scenes, doesn't help. It tells the audience exactly how to feel, and I hate that. \n\nThe Night of the Hunter isn't a bad film per se. In fact, the film's premise is fascinating--and darker than any Hitchcock movie from the same period. There's no doubt about it, this movie has a certain atmosphere of moodiness and terror than makes your heart pound. I just wish I spent more time on the edge of my seat and less time cringing at what I felt was the fakeness and obviousness of the whole production.",

It's an incredible shame as he would surely have gone on to make some wonderful stuff if this film is any guide - it is the confident, assured work of a man with a total understanding of the medium. The photography, influenced by German Expressionism, is magnificent in its composition: eerie shadows combine with a soundtrack of crickets chirruping and toads croaking to create a super-tense atmosphere; the scene where the children's boat drifts down the river as they attempt to escape from Reverend Harry Powell is possibly the most starkly beautiful scene I have seen in any film. Robert Mitchum gives a career-best performance as Powell the unhinged psychopathic preacher but credit must go to Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce as John and Pearl, the unfortunate children harbouring the $10,000 that Powell pursues - they're simply amazing. Lillian Gish is also brilliant as the old lady who offers the children their true salvation.

Si parte dal classico Mostro di Dusseldorf, il pedofilo interpretato da Peter Lorre in uno dei film piÃ¹ belli della storia del cinema. Poi molti anni dopo Ã¨ la volta dell'Uomo che entra direttamente nei sogni dei ragazzi per spaventarli a morte. E con gli anni '90 arriva il Nerd di turno che fa domande di cinema al telefono e se non rispondi bene sei destinato a una brutta fine. Ma l'esempio piÃ¹ terrificante di tutti Ã¨ il predicatore Harry Powell interpretato da un gigantesco -in tutti i sensi- Robert Mitchum nel film \"Night of the hunter -La morte corre sul fiume\": ha \"Love\" e \"Hate\" scritte sulle nocche ed Ã¨ caratterizzato da una capacitÃ  di affabulazione incredibile, tale da generare subito simpatia in chi Ã¨ piÃ¹ ingenuo. Non nei bambini, perÃ².\nPowell Ã¨ stato compagno di cella del contadino Ben Harper (no, non il cantante), padre di famiglia destinato alla forca per rapina a mano armata e omicidio. La refurtiva perÃ² Ã¨ al sicuro, nelle mani dei suoi figli che la terranno nascosta anche dalla stessa madre finchÃ (C) non saranno abbastanza maturi per spenderli e allontanarsi dalla vita nei campi. Powell, con le sue capacitÃ  di predicatore, si ingrazierÃ  la neo-vedova fino a sposarla, rendendo la vita dei due bambini un autentico incubo. \nPer certi versi \"Night of the hunter\" Ã¨ impostato come uno di quei horror che uscivano negli anni '30 dalla Universal. C'Ã¨ il cattivo spietato, gli abitanti fin troppo ingenui del villaggio e il protagonista sveglio deciso a sconfiggere la minaccia. Qui i protagonisti sono due, i bambini, e appaiono determinati e risoluti nel rispettare il giuramento fatto col padre e non dare i soldi al predicatore. Ma sono anche inermi e spaventati e non possono fare molto quando il personaggio in questione Ã¨ alto un metro e mezzo piÃ¹ di loro e tiene sotto scacco la loro stessa madre, interpretata da una Shirley Winters perfettamente in parte. Col passare del tempo, la fuga sarÃ  inevitabile, ma Powell Ã¨ sempre in agguato. \nLa regia di Laughton, grande attore apparso anche in \"Spartacus, Ã¨ impeccabile, con un uso delle luci e delle ombre che si rifa' ai film dell'espressionismo tedesco. Molte scene sono impostate come dei sogni: all'inizio del film vediamo un cielo notturno e in sovrimpressione appare il viso di Lillian Gish, diva del muto e vera eroina del film, che racconta una storia dalla Bibbia a dei bambini -scena che probabilmente avrÃ  influenzato lo stesso Lynch per il suo grado di bizzarria. Poi arriva il giorno e la cinepresa si sposta sulla terra, sull'antagonista in viaggio mentre immagina di parlare delle sue malefatte con Dio. Momenti di puro cinema, ma anche di terrore sono le sequenze in cantina, senza musica, con l'Uomo Nero che arriva in cerca dei bambini nascosti: Chilllllllldren, Chillllllllldren, I can hear you breathin'. I can Feel myself getting awful mad. Non fatevi ingannare dal bianco e nero. Questo film Ã¨ molto piÃ¹ inquietante di decine di horror che affollano le sale attualmente.",

            "content": "This is a hard film to categorize.  It's part thriller, part morality play, and part character study, with abundant symbolism and strong religious overtones.  From the very beginning, as we see the faces of children against a backdrop of stars, and hear a woman reading to them from Scripture about the danger of false prophets, there's an eerie, disquieting feeling to it.\r\n\tThe plot follows two young children, John and Pearl.  When we first meet them, they witness their father returning home- from a bank robbery! As sirens blare in the distance, he hides the money, and then makes his children promise to tell no-one where it's hidden, before police arrive and drag him away.  What the children don't know is that their troubles have only begun.  They're about to run afoul of one of the slimiest most menacing villains in the screen's history: \"Brother\" Harry Powell; played by George Mitchum in a truly spectacular performance.\r\n\tHis first appearance, earlier in the film, immediately follows the exhortations to \"Beware false prophets,\" not a good sign.  From his words and deeds over the next few moments, it's clear that he's a self-serving conman who preys on young ladies and widows, seducing them so that he can part them from their money.  What's more, he's clearly deranged.  He not only uses his guise as an itinerate preacher to deceive his victims, he's deluded himself into believing that he is carrying out God's will, and that his actions are therefore righteous.  He also holds a deep hatred for women.  He hates their clothes, their curly hair, and the smell of their perfume- and he has convinced himself that so does God.  \r\nEvery time he appears onscreen, the music and lighting become ominous. It's not long before even the slightest hint of him- his distant silhouette, his whistle, even the hymns he sings- become sinister in the minds of the audience.\r\n\tAnd by some strange twist of fate, he finds himself sharing a cell with the children's father, from whom he overhears talk of the money.  The moment he's released, he finds the man's widow, and begins working his magic on her. Before long, and with the blessing of the townsfolk, the two are married.  Not long afterwards, the mother lies dead at the bottom of the river, and nothing but the two children stand between him and the money.\r\nWhat's truly alarming is the ease in which he wins over, and then manipulates, those around him, especially the women.  From the moment he introduces himself as a minister and spins his bogus tale about having been a prison chaplain, he gains the town's complete trust.  From this point on, he barely has to make any effort at courting the children's mother; the townspeople to the work for him, telling her that she'll be lucky to find another man like him.\r\nEven when she begins to glimpse his dark side, she continues to believe that he loves her.  When he condemns her for wanting to consummate their marriage on their wedding night, she breaks down and prays for forgiveness.  Soon he has her confessing how her constant demand for fancy clothes and perfumes led her husband to commit his crimes, as the townsfolk provide amen's and hallelujah's.  Even after she hears him threatening her daughter over the money, she deludes herself that he only seeks to free them from the money's taint. But even this faith in him is not enough to save her from his hatred and paranoia.\r\nNow, with their mother out of the way, Powell can unleash his full wrath on John and Pearl.  The film's most frightening scene follows, when he takes the children down into the basement in search of the treasure.   After a narrow escape, John leads his sister to their father's skiff, and they set off down the river, beginning the film's second act.\r\nTheir trip downriver is eerie and surreal.  In some shots they to be drifting through the sky or outer space rather than a river; with only their boat and a backdrop of twinkling stars visible.  At other times the pass characters out of old children's stories, such as a tortoise and hare, or a spider spinning its web. The music, and Pearl's singing only add to the strangeness.  And throughout their travels, we are constantly reminded that they are being pursued.\r\nAs I watched, I was struck with how the children's innocence contrasted starkly with Powell's villainy. John, the older sibling is honor and duty personified.  Throughout our tale his goals and motivations are to honor his father's last wishes, and to protect his younger sister.  He also shows the wisdom and discernment of someone beyond his years.  Among the townspeople, he is the only one to see Powell for who he truly is.  Pity that no one listens to him.\r\nPearl, for her part, is too young to really understand what's going on around her.  She has had no experience with evil, and therefore cannot yet understand that anyone would have impure motives or wish her harm.  When Powell marries their mother, she thinks that it's ok to tell him the secret because he's their daddy now.  She also believes Powell's repeated claims that \"John is bad\" for opposing him.  Only when she is threatened does she begin to understand the danger.\r\nTheir journey- but not their adventure- comes to an end when they reach the farm of Rachel (Lillian Gish)  Gish has unquestionably earned her reputation as a queen of the silver screen, from her early work for WEB Griffith to her appearance in Titanic, and this is surely one of her best performances.  Her character may be headstrong and sometimes judgmental, but she is a paragon of kindness, love, and good sense. \r\nShe is Powell's opposite in every way.  Where he sees the children only as a tool to be exploited, she views them as charges to care for and give a good upbringing to.  He misquotes Scripture to justify his actions, and twists it to suit his purposes.  Cooper uses it to give her strength, and to comfort her adopted family.  And while he would have condemned Ruby, her eldest child, for having secretly dated the boys in town, and then used her shame to gain power over her, Cooper reassures her that although she has done wrong, she is still a good person, and will make a fine young woman someday. It is in her that Powell may have finally met his match.\r\nI won't spoil the ending, save to say that there's a tense contest of wills and that the villain gets what he deserves in the end.  I would also like to say that this movie does an excellent job of showing how easily -and violently- the mob can be swayed.  I'll close by saying that this movie is a bit strange, but it succeeds at being both chilling and heartwarming, and contains two of cinema's greatest heroes and villains.  This one is definitely worth checking out.",

            "content": "Beautifully filmed, twisted, suspenseful...the adjectives to describe The Night of the Hunter could go on infinitely but above all else I will say that it is a classic of the thriller genre that demonstrates the true depth of beauty that the cinematographic image can achieve.  At times, the film's actors give it a somewhat cheesy vibe, but these moments are completely overshadowed by Charles Laughton's ability to sculpt some of the most powerful, unforgettable, and beautiful images in film history.  Oddly enough, The Night of the Hunter features Shelley Winters in the role of a mother that in many ways parallels her role as Dolores's mother in Stanley Kubrick's Lolita.  Similar to Lolita, Shelley Winters plays a widow who meets a man who apparently loves her because he wants something from her offspring.  In the case of Lolita, it is young Dolores Haze's preadolescent body, but, in The Night of the Hunter, it is the children's knowledge about the whereabouts of the money their father had stolen before he died.  And, of course, Robert Mitchum's role as the fake preacher/stepfather serves as the focal point of the film, for Mitchum delivers a truly devious performance as a man with Love and Hate tattooed on his hands who also appropriately sings \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\" while committing heinous acts.  But even Mitchum's powerful performance would not elevate the film so high without the masterful shots that compose it, which are almost impossible to describe in words as they blend real settings with sound stages, natural beauty with the horror of mankind, a fairy tale aesthetic with the brutal artistry of a thriller or horror film.  In summation, The Night of the Hunter has its faults (mostly due to some cheesy acting and writing), but it overcomes these in its powerfully sublime depiction of absolute evil versus pure innocence.",

I really liked Lilain Gelsh's performance, not very keen on Mitchum's, but then again it was not really that hard of a role, he did deliver some really scary scenes. The Film is actually pretty scary in the sense that it would probably make a lot of people feel insecure because it focuses on a religious leader gone mad, Guess that's what happens with fanatics. The film has a couple of moments where I thought about religion, not necessarily the bad parts of it, the good parts, which are incredibly rare. Charity is something I saw but then again that has nothing to do with religion, when the kids are taken in. It's a great movie, it's scary, it's well acted from most of the cast, it's haunting, it's short and sleek and to the point, and it's just flat out a well made film.",

Robert Mitchum gives one of his greatest performances as the misogynistic and avaricious false charismatic preacher who spellbinds adults. He is relentlessly  pursuing the two young children, played by Billy Chapman and Sally Jane Bruce in two sterling performances after murdering their mother, in order to fine the whereabouts of $10,000 of bank-robbery loot that was hid by their late father, who was executed for killing a bank teller. The children flee to the homestead of a wise old matron, played magnificently by silent screen legend Lillian Gish, who takes in the kids and becomes their unconventional savior, and protects them from their malevolent stalker. This great film was the only directorial effort by the Oscar winning actor Charles Laughton, there are superlative supporting performances by Shelley Winters, Peter Graves, James Gleason and Don Beddoe. But Mitchum's show-stopping turn steals the film, we did not expect this level of menace from the character he created, to be so terrifically frightening. Special kudos must be given to Stanley Cortez for his spectacular surreal cinematography. A compelling and evocative film that stays in your mind like a fever dream. Highly Recommended.",
