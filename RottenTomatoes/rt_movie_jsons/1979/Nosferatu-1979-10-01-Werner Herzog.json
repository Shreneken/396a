Inspired by a photograph of Lucy Harker, Jonathan's wife, Dracula moves to Virna, bringing with him death and plague... An unusually contemplative version of Dracula, in which the vampire bears the cross of not being able to get old and die.",

            "content": "Werner Herzog's Nosferatu, a remake of Murnau's silent classic, puts a unique spin on the vampire genre \u2013 an antagonist with whom, because of his intense loneliness and dread of eternal life, the audience sympathizes with.  While there are no jump scares or excessive gore, Nosferatu works as a horror film based on the atmosphere of dread that it creates, thanks in part to Herzog's ability to create chilling images through effective lighting and creative camera angles, but most attributable to Klaus Kinski's performance as Count Dracula, a sullen, vicious, wheezing monster.  While it's far from perfect (the dialogue is awkward at times, some of the performances seem stilted, the score early on seems inappropriate for the time period), it remains a dark and troubling nightmare of a film.",

There might be TV shows, books, and all kinds of movies about vampires that you *prefer* and enjoy watching more than this film, (not to be mean about your taste or anything, but\u2026I certainly hope that's not the case). And it seems so obvious in hindsight that the iteration of this story that's \u2013\u00a0quite objectively \u2013 the best one ever told was directed by a person who had never even seen a movie or knew what a television was until he left home at age 17 to see the world and learn as much as possible about it: Werner Herzog. AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS that Werner Herzog had an extremely volatile working relationship with the film's (co-) lead, Klaus Kinski \u2013\u00a0but OF COURSE(!) Werner and Klaus somehow always found a way to get through the workday on set\u2026after all, they were rather inseparable friends\u2026when they weren't making a film together.\n\nBut if that's not convinced you to watch this film (not only watch it, but watch it with the understanding that after you have seen it, you will NEVER need to see another movie or TV show about vampires EVER AGAIN \u2013\u00a0since nothing can or will live up to this one's quality), then you should watch it for the always-exceptional Isabelle Adjani. To any fellow Horror fans, I don't need to tell you about Isabelle Adjani. But to the uninitiated, I'll just point towards (arguably) the greatest Horror film ever made: \"Possession\" (1981). If anyone can watch that film and claim that Adjani's performance isn't one of the greatest pieces of acting they've ever seen, then that person is in fact \u2013\u00a0and this is true! \u2013 the most shallow human being on the planet, (and they might be dangerous due to their inability to feel empathy or feel any kind of human emotions\u2026OH WAIT VAMPIRES ARE REAL!)\n\n*And you thought my review was just rambling that wouldn't come back full circle at the end? Honestly, I don't blame you. But now you know how I roll. Keep up. I move quick.*",

            "content": "While clear homage is made to F.W. Murnau's eternally classic Nosferatu vampire, 'Nosferatur the Vampyre' is pure Warner Herzog; whatever that means. For me, it means most of all that it is the true, pure vision of an auteur all his own. There's only one Herzog.\nCouple Herzog with his chief acting collaborator Klaus Kinski in the title role, and you have the makings for a special work of cinema. And that is what this film is, though it certainly has its eccentricities, questionable turns, and almost comical in a bad way moments. But I'm sure that had I seen this movie as a kid, it would've scared the unholy bejeebus-ness out of this white boy. Jinkies! \nKinski is one horrific figure in the Count Dracula makeup and clothing. Bruno Ganz is on point as man trying to make a nice tidy sum with an exchange of property, but it's with a count who is undead and survives on the blood of the unwitting. Then add Isabelle Adjani, an actress who made two of the most disturbing, warped movies of their time with 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' and 'Possession' within two years of each other. In both see seems possessed of some mania; an unsettled vision pale as a white sheet. \nThen there's the hundreds of rats bringing the plague to the villagers. There's the madman Renfield giggling maniacally in all his scenes. And to top it off, the bizarre, almost arbitrary act of arresting the one man who sees to it that the murderous vampire is dead for sure. Bizarro times 12. \n3.4 stars, but don't ask exactly why, as that seems quite arbitrary as well.",

            "content": "Werner Herzog was, and still is, a very talented film-maker, but he's not the only reason as to why to see 'Nosferatu the Vampyre'. That it is based on a classic story, had a larger than life, commanding and great actor in the title role in Klaus Kinski and that it was a re-make of the 1922 Murnau masterpiece 'Nosferatu' were further interest points.\n\nAdmittedly did question as to whether 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' would work, being a re-make. Re-makes hardly ever are equal to their originals and some don't even come close. There is no doubting which is better and more influential between Murnau's film and this, but 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' is a strong example of a re-make that works well, with the Murnau film being a very clear influence, and is a very good film on its own terms. Found myself never questioning its necessity, like can be the case watching re-makes.\n\nThe ending is a little rushed and doesn't quite have the unforgettable chills or power of the 1922 film. Personally had little problem with the acting, but a couple of actors did deserve more screen time, a notable example being Van Helsing. Can understand the criticisms with the pacing, 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' to me actually worked very well as a deliberate mood piece and as a film told through primarily visuals but maybe yes it could have taken a little less longer to get going.\n\n'Nosferatu the Vampyre' looks magnificent, perhaps one of Herzog's most visually striking and most atmospheric films. This is coming from the director whose films were also well-made and looked great but when his films are being talked about this element can be upstaged by the talking about the themes and Herzog's trademarks, which are undeniably fascinating to read and talk about but Herzog's production values are worthy of a little more credit. The colours dazzle, the lighting is very atmospheric with a striking contrast of light and dark, the production design is both audacious and eerie but how the camera shots and editing are composed.\n\nPopol Vuh's music score is both unsettling and dream-like, matching the nature of the visuals perfectly. Typically Herzog directs splendidly, delivering on the substance as well as the style. The script flows surprisingly well and is cohesive, and the story is rich in an atmosphere that's at times grimly eerie and at times contemplative. Despite calling it a re-make, 'Nosferatu the Vampyre' is more a faithful homage while also having significant updates and expanding on the titular character's tragic loneliness.\n\nKlaus Kinski is in towering form as Nosferatu. He is genuinely scary in a larger than life way, almost as nightmare inducing as Maximilian Schreck, but counter-points that wonderfully with tragic pathos delivered with heartfelt sincerity. While the other actors aren't quite as good the divide isn't as wide as one would think. Isabelle Adjani is suitably ethereal, making even more of an impression are Roland Topor's creepy, skin-crawlingly so, Renfield and Bruno Ganz's assertive but vulnerable Harker (a role much better acted than most, a notoriously bad example being Keanu Reeves in Coppola's otherwise often impressive film). Walter Ladengast is suitably low-key though with not a role as meaty as ought.\n\nOverall, great film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Nosferatu is probably a good film, but it's plagued by odd choices. Weird lingering shots that serve no purpose and almost feel comical, and sharp cuts. Some of these are done to match a scene or tone from the original film, but other times they're just odd. Because of this, the film often drags miserably. \nOther times, it holds you in a hypnotic trance. Any time Klaus Kinski was on screen, I was on board. He is so weird and captivating in his portrayal of Dracula, and that portrayal is really what makes the telling of this story sink or swim. I am also just a sucker for the madman that is Herzog. Even at his worst, Herzog is intriguing if nothing else.\nTo most modern audiences this film will be painfully slow. It often was for me. It's a film for a particular mood. It's not Herzog's best, but an engaging portrayal by Kinski and unique take on the story give it merit.",

            "content": "Nosferatu the Vampyre (or, Nosferatu: Phantom of the Night) is German director Werner Herzog's not quite remake of F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent horror masterpiece. Murnau was not able to secure the rights to Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula, so he changed the character names and locations and some plot points to avoid legal troubles. Herzog does not consider his film a remake, but he follows the structure of Murnau's film more than Stoker's novel. Werner Herzog is the kind of filmmaker incapable of making a simple genre picture. His version of Nosferatu is not straightforward horror, but it is haunting and transfixing.\n\nThe plot is familiar enough. Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz), a young real estate attorney, is sent to Transylvania to oversee the purchase of an estate, close to his own home in Wismar, Germany, by the mysterious Count Dracula.  The Count falls in love with a picture of Jonathan's wife, Lucy (Isabelle Adjani), imprisons Jonathan, and sets off to claim the young bride as his own.\n\nKlaus Kinski plays Count Dracula as a forlorn creature of menace and despair. His look is the same as Count Orlok, played by Max Schreck, in Murnau's Nosferatu, one of the most iconic images in film history, instantly recognizable whether you've seen the film or not. His skin is bone white, with a head like an animated skull, fingers like slender claws, and two pronounced fangs are front and center in his mouth. The vampire in Murnau's film was only a monster, but here he is presented as a pitiful, melancholy creature. This Dracula has no brides or servants. He tells Harker that there are worse things than death, like enduring centuries repeating the same futile nights. In Wismar, he tells Lucy that he wishes to partake of what she and Jonathan share.\n\nCount Dracula is a supernatural creature but still seems to be tied into Herzog's fascination with the unrelenting and overwhelming force that nature has over humankind (see Aguirre, the Wrath of God, Fitzcarraldo, and Grizzly Man for more intense and unrelenting nature). Harker's journey through ageless mountains and canyons to Dracula's castle is an extended sequence set to Richard Wagner's prelude to Das Rheingold, a choice that enhances the natural landscape's sense of beauty and awe and foreboding. Hidden deep in that intimidating landscape is Dracula.\n\nBram Stoker's novel has Harker's wife, Mena, as a perfect Victorian era woman that needs to be preserved and protected. Here, Harker's wife, Lucy, mostly absent from the first half of the film, becomes the main character in the second half and is the only person willing to take action to stop Dracula and the plague spreading rats he has unleashed on the city. This version of Lucy is an agent not only for her own destiny but the whole city.\n\nHerzog and cinematographer J\u00f6rg Schmidt-Reitwein use a handheld camera for many scenes, adding a degree of uncomfortable authenticity and realism to the supernatural story. Unlike the Universal Studios and Hammer productions of Dracula, these locations and sets look and feel real and lived in. Everything from the chairs and silverware to Dracula's macabre clock feel like real, functional things and imply that he can exist outside of fantasy.\n\nWatching this film in 2021, it is especially horrifying that Dracula's arrival in Wismar doesn't just mean the arrival of a vampire. Dracula also brings a huge swarm of bubonic plague spreading rats. A scene of Lucy wandering through plague-ridden Wismar has her encountering a group of people in their finest clothes having their last supper; one tells her that all of the guests are infected with the plague so they are enjoying what they have while they can. The procession of coffins through the town square is like an endless macabre parade.\n\nHerzog was tasked with producing two versions of this film: one in German and one in English, for international markets. After a scene was done in German it would be shot again with the same actors speaking English. Herzog has said that he views the German language version as more authentic since it was his attempt to link classic and modern German filmmaking. There is obviously some dubbing for the minor characters but, overall, I got the same effect from both versions. I recommend this film in general, but I highly recommend it for an atmospheric but not-so-scary night.",

At first, I was unconvinced that Murnau's horror classic could use a remake, even by a filmmaker of Herzog's reputation. The early scenes are essentially as you would expect them to be, employing a near-identical screenplay with updated shooting quality and techniques, albeit with a clear eye for bleak color palettes stark cinematography, and leaving you wondering if this was all really necessary. But as the film progresses, it gradually becomes clear that Herzog had a distinctive vision for the material, using Nosferatu as more of a psychological force than a base monster, and incorporating surrealist imagery as the town of Wismar succumbs to his influence. The desolate town squares, the desperate joyous death dances, and the wandering animals are all interesting components of this \"less is more\" depiction of plague and social collapse. Kinski is one of the few performers that could really match the distinctive intensity that Max Schreck brought to the role, and Adjani is not only a note-perfect match for the film's visual style (willowy, pale, and gaunt), but gives a strong performance to match. Herzog turns what could easily have been a vanity project into something with far more substance. (4/5)",

Still interesting to watch, though. Dig into the backstory too; Klaus Kinski was so difficult to work with that the first offer for a leading lady turned it down rather than work with him and Herzog would deliberately precipitate a tantrum (apparently easy to do) to exhaust Kinski so his acting would be more subdued from exhaustion.

However this version had no such issues as the Dracula story was now in the public domain.\n\nAs to the film itself. It is a West German production. Apparently two language versions were made, original German and an English dialogue version. I watched the original German dialogue with English subtitles.\n\nCount Dracula himself is played by Klaus Kinski who endured 4 hours of make up EACH day for his scary visual version with pointy ears,  white bald head and fingers that looked like blades from Oscar Pistorius.\nDirector Werner Herzog uses international locations ranging from The Netherlands, Slovakia and Mexico to bring his version to the screen. Making his low budget production look much more expensive.\n\nAn excellent film, that appears anything but. Hammer Horror with Christopher Lee it ain't. Kinski's Dracula is far more convincing.\n",

            "content": "Nosferatu: The Vampyre is a remake of an adaptation - the film shares its title and premise with a 1922 German silent film simply called Nosferatu, which is itself an unlicensed adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. The film follows a naive German real estate agent named Johnathan Harker who travels to Transylvania to meet the reclusive Count Dracula in hopes of arranging a real estate deal. There he discovers a horror which migrates from the Carpathian Mountains to his home city of Wismar. The general premise is nearly identical the silent film upon which it is based, with some of the names changed to reflect those of the original novel, which was out of copyright by 1979. The specifics, however, especially in the third act, have changed substantially, creating a film that distinguishes itself from the original with a bleaker ending and a more detailed depiction of Wismar's decimation by the plague which accompanies Dracula. The ability to record dialogue also allows greater characterization of the central actors, especially Jonathan's wife, Lucy, and Count Dracula, played exceptionally by Klaus Kinski as a creature who is almost sympathetic in his lamentations about the loneliness of eternal life. The viewer can listen to these lamentations in both English and German, as director Werner Herzog shot each scene in both languages, although Herzog states that the performances are better in the German version. On the other hand, the camerawork and lighting of Werner Herzog's adaptation cannot compare to the genuinely unsettling mise-en-sc\u00e8ne in the original. Regardless, Nosferatu: The Vampyre is one of the rare remakes that could reasonably, albeit not conclusively, be argued to by superior to the original, making it a good film for those of us who don't enjoy silent films.",

Herzog's version does not need to hide it's connection to the novel \"Dracula\", so the characters have their names restored.  Bruno Ganz is Jonathan Harker, sent by Roland Topor's Renfield to the castle of Klaus Kinski's Count Dracula to assist him with buying a home in the German town of Bremen.  Kinski's makeup, modelled after Max Shreck's makeup in Murnau's film, depicts Dracula as a monstrous, walking dead ratman, who traps Harker in his castle and heads to Bremen and Harker's wife Lucy (Isabelle Adjani).  After this fairly familiar set up, the film departs quite radically from it's source and it's identity as a Herzog film is fairly apparent (if anything, this often feels like a strange companion piece to \"The Enigma of Kasper Hauser\")  Dracula brings with him plague and rats, and the town descends into madness.  Harker and Van Helsing are ineffectual, and it's Lucy that determines the nature of the threat and takes Dracula on.  Kinski's Dracula is a brooding monster longing for death ... which kind of summarizes the mood of the entire film.  The casting of Alejandro Jodorowsky's buddy Topor as Renfield is inspired.  He's the only film Renfield that can hold a candle to Dwight Frye.  Years later, Kinkski agreed to reprise his role in \"Nosferatu a Venezia\", but hilariously refused to don the makeup again for that role.  Why would he do it for anyone but Herzog?",

            "content": "Werner Herzog's Classic Remake of F. W. Murnau's Horror Classic\n\nWerner Herzog clearly idolized the original Nosferatu. He captures the genius of the atmosphere that made the original silent film such a creepy classic in the horror genre. From the long pans of someone walking away to the shadows creeping along walls to lead into the appearance of Nosferatu, Herzog successfully recreates all the most famous and beloved sequences of the original Nosferatu, while adding his own personal touches and depth. Nosferatu is one of Werner Herzog's finest films.\n\nThe set pieces and props are even immaculate in their disgusting vibe bringing. The dust and cobwebs in a dreary realistic castle and a man stuck in the middle of the danger. The sets are perfectly uncanny and unsettling. Werner Herzog builds a believable world to haunt you. To help the audience into imaging a town ridden with the plague, Herzog unleashed a horde of rats to inspire images of The Black Death. Herzog's uncomprising dedication to his craft is awe inspiring as it is vile in it's execution to witness. Herzog's world seems so dark.\n\nHerzog's characters are very deep and complex. Herzog's Jonathan Harker is emotional and more relatable than many I've seen. His Renfield is crazier than ever. The Lucy character is given a bigger role than most heroines are ever given, marking Herzog's film as uniquely progressive. She has premonitions of danger to warn Harker, she figures out the secret of the vampire, and she must challenge Nosferatu both romantically and bravely.\n\nOf course, the main draw is German mega star is Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula himself. Kinski's takes up the task of recreating and renewing the magic that was Max Schreck's legendary performance as Nosferatu. Schreck's uniquely grotesque body image is the uncanny horror of the original film. Instead, Klaus Kinski is monstrous uncontrollable who must stalk and seduce his way through eternal life. Kinski's performance is so captivating as his wild crazy eyes are so engaging as his voice and movements are so very subtle. Kinski plays Nosferatu as a sad being cursed to the shadows for eternity. It's so intriguing, especially his speech to Harker and his plea to Lucy wherein Kinski laments his infinite misery. A magnificent acting display which has aged into one of Kinski's finest. Klaus Kinski was born for these shadows.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Nosferatu the Vampyre as a chilling recreation of perhaps the greatest silent film, certainly the greatest horror film of its era. Werner Herzog proves his film making prowess and Kinski lays down another excellent acting performance.\n\nThis film is essentially perfect. It's more detailed and risk taking than the original. Anyone that found the original too slow or not deep enough is sure to be pleased by Herzog's shifting score, faster pace, long pans, thrilling actors, and terrifying sets. It's the ultimate remake.",

I could not have been more wrong. This interpretation is tedious in its presentation. There are so many long agonizing takes of absolutely nothing happening with some of the most obnoxious repetitive music you can imagine. I hated every moment of it, and came close to skipping ahead just to stop the frustration. The acting was atrocious, because it was so melodramatic. It was as if the actors still thought they were in a silent film and had to convey everything just with their facial expressions. Werner Herzog tries to make some artistic statements with lots of shots of rotting and decay and rats. It drags the film almost to a complete stop at times, and bored me to the point that I almost fell asleep. Then they rush through the final act, when the real confrontation is just getting started. Ordinarily I would hate that, but anything to get this movie to end was welcome. They throw in something that is probably meant to be a twist at the end, but they telegraphed it too much throughout the film, so there was no surprise there. I genuinely hated Nosferatu the Vampyre, and the only positive that came out of watching it was the fact that I have developed a greater appreciation of the original silent film because it worked better than this one.",

The music compliments the images perfectly. \n\nWerner again with the amazing production quality. You can see he did;t go cheap on costumes, setting, and locations. You can really see this when Jonathan walks through the city and all the townspeople are out and it seems so authentic and alive. I want to visit a small European city so bad. Damn, Renfield looks mad. You can see it in his eyes, it\u00e2(TM)s almost like he\u00e2(TM)s possessed by something or someone. I like how half of the horse is in the shot when Jonathan goes off. It\u00e2(TM)s funny. \n\nAhh, there\u00e2(TM)s nothing more I want to do than ride on a horse in the mountains and countryside. There\u00e2(TM)s no greater feeling. Werner has a knack for really showing the grittiness and rawness of settings and things. It\u00e2(TM)s one of the many things he\u00e2(TM)s good at. It\u00e2(TM)s almost like he\u00e2(TM)s showing how it really was back then all dirty and shit. No props, no set pieces, no studios. Just out in the countryside mountains filming. That\u00e2(TM)s how it should be. \n\nI don\u00e2(TM)t know how Werner does it but he\u00e2(TM)s able to find these amazing locations like when Jonathan is walking through down that path in between a river that\u00e2(TM)s violently flowing through the mountains. It\u00e2(TM)s quite amazing how Werner is able to invoke a feeling of uneasiness just by showing shadows of the mountains and the clouds that surround it. I;m so glad Werner got Kinski to play Nosferatu. He\u00e2(TM)s a great actor. Very underrated. That grandfather clock was amazing. Who built it? H.R. Giger. The intensity that Klaus can create when he\u00e2(TM)s acting is like nothing else. He\u00e2(TM)s really good at creating that feeling of uneasiness. \n\nThat castles architecture is so interesting. The way the hallways are made with these tall narrow ominous looking arches instead of low and squared. And the way the rooms feel so cramped and claustrophobic. This is gothic architecture at it\u00e2(TM)s finest. It\u00e2(TM)s crazy how in tune Lucy is with everything that\u00e2(TM)s going on between Nosferatu and her husband, Jonathan. She has that sixth sense. \n\nI actually sympathize with the Count when he\u00e2(TM)s talking about being immortal and not being able to die. I would not like to be immortal. That was pretty impressive how he was able to in real life climb down the cloth rope. \n\nIt\u00e2(TM)s a pretty wild and outlandish thought, but what it the Black Plague was actually brought upon by vampires. Like what if vampires actually existed and do still exist?! What I did;t really realize from watching the original, and it isn;t until watching this version, is that the whole time, Nosferatu was trying to end his immortality, his life. He knew once he heard Lucy\u00e2(TM)s scream that it was true love between Lucy and Jonathan. And since Nosferatu\u00e2(TM)s immortality could only be reversed by drinking the blood of a girl who\u00e2(TM)s in love and true of heart, he set out to find her, regardless of the circumstances. I like how the sails of the ship look blood red after it\u00e2(TM)s dried. \n\nThe way the ship creeps up on the canal with the music slowly getting louder was great. Both horrifying and amazing how they got so many rodents in one location. Holy shit, I think they used the same location where Nosferatu stayed in Wismar from the original 1922 version. Lucy\u00e2(TM)s a very strong minded and strong willed woman going to seek out the count in a spooky ass abandoned building. Has a bit of a cynical ending, more than the original. \n\nThis movie is a brilliant work of art filled with gorgeous locations and settings. Some of the shots filmed in this movie could be paused and admired. The use of color and shadows is elegant and beautiful.  Edgar Allan Poe would have cherished this movie if he would have seen it.",

            "content": "This review is full of spoilers\n\t\n\tThis remake had potential, but laziness ruined it. Early on I began to wonder about how much effort had been put into producing a well made, cohesive film as Jonathan Harker and Mina were walking along a rainswept beach contemplating his journey into the unknown with solemnity and anxiety as the soundtrack played a jaunty annoying tune that was a complete mismatch for the mood of the moment. And then there was the actor portraying Renfield's over the top  crazy giggle after each and every line he uttered while enlisting Harker for the journey to Transylvania. He might have been more subtle if he had worn a blinking neon sign that read \"I'm CRAZY!\"\n\tWatching Johnathan Harker ride a horse while leaving Mina in Venice I was wondering where was he going to leave the animal when he boarded the train to Transylvania. Silly me! He went ahead and rode the horse all the way. That's realistic. In Transylvania the peasants took his horse from him, because he had ridden it too long so they were going to rehabilitate it. Seriously.\n\tThe cinematography in Transylvania was actually very nice. The vistas of mountains and the roiling mists evoked a sense of antiquity and dread that were perfectly attuned to a vampire tale. Klaus Kinski was an interesting and adequate version of Nosferatu, though never any serious competition for the terrifying wraith immortalized by Max Schreck.\n\tThe one serious mistake that made me feel as if the filmmakers just didn't care about their work was when Lucy Westerna is found dead, and a woman runs to tell Mina about the death of her best friend. This woman calls Mina Lucy. I thought at first I was reading the subtitles incorrectly, but it seemed that from this point on Mina was referred to as Lucy. Attention to detail is one thing, but completely forgetting the correct name of a principal character is another.\n\tThe climactic scene left me nonplussed as well. In the original Mina lures the vampire to her bedchamber, and encourages him to drink her blood as a way to distract him until the sun rises thus killing him. This act of self sacrifice in the original held great power, but in this remake it was totally pointless as Jonathan Harker is transformed into a vampire as Dracula dies. Mina sacrificed herself for nothing. The final scene of the movie is of Jonathan Harker now transformed into a vampire riding a horse toward the horizon in full daylight. Somehow the same sun that killed the ancient Dracula had no effect of the newly minted Harkula. I love having my intelligence insulted like anyone else, but this movie takes it a step too far.",

            "content": "Look into the eyes of Greek goddess Medusa and you'll find yourself suddenly turned into stone, not solely because of petrifying fear but also because of a masochistic curse placed upon her.  Gaze into the eyes of \"Nosferatu the Vampyre's\" Count Dracula and you might want to turn into stone - to be in anyone else's presence would be much more favorable.  Despite silky good manners that suggest he's little else besides a serpentinely eloquent nobleman blessed with high class courtesy, terror overcomes you the instance he makes his way into the room.\n\tHe does not resemble a man but a monster, a being who is one with the night.  His skin is as pale as the glistening moonlight that only sometimes dares to hang over him; his eyes are beady and bloodthirsty, feral even.  His body is hairless, untouched by a sign of humanity.  His ears are pointed like a portentous bies, his fingernails and teeth sets of ivory daggers varying in size.  He seems to glide, not walk; he exists as nothing, as no one - he's perhaps older than the universe itself, a force of personified evil impossible to arrantly distinguish.\n\tHis design is directly based off the mysterious Count Orlok of 1922's legendary \"Nosferatu,\" a German silent film (directed by F.W. Murnau) that exploited the horrors of vampirism before it was turned into iconic camp in 1931 by Bela Lugosi.  This 1979 quasi-remake, written and directed by uncompromising iconoclast Werner Herzog, is hardly an homage (or is, at least, too good to feel like one) nor a shameful rip-off: it's the spiritual, modern counterpart to a cinematic great, untouched by unnecessary comparison because it, in itself, inspires dread on an individualistic level.  Herzog, both visually and technically, derives a sense of nightmarish beauty that haunts us long after we're through with its menacing inflictions.\n\t\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" initially stars Bruno Ganz as Jonathan Harker, a real estate agent assigned by his boss, the mad Renfield (Roland Topor), to travel to the Transylvanian mansion of Count Dracula, an enigmatic recluse who wishes to buy property in Germany.  Tasked with enforcing a lucrative deal, plans are made to stay with the grandee until a final decision is made.  The expedition is somewhat protested by Harker's wife, the doe-eyed Lucy (Isabelle Adjani), but it's understood that Dracula's potential purchase could do much for business.   Harker isn't much skeptical; this kind of work is nothing new for an experienced man of his distinction.\n\tBut warning signs steadily appear the closer he gets to Dracula's evasive manor.  The journey is peppered by numerous instances of strenuous paths that no man should ever find himself wandering on.  Villagers fall deathly silent so long as the count's name is simply mentioned.  But Harker is too determined to let his instincts get the better of him; it's not like his client can hold him prisoner once he arrives.  If disquiet becomes too overwhelming, he can leave if necessary.\n\tThe second Dracula (Klaus Kinski) greets him at the gates of his home, however, Harker is instantaneously afflicted by uncertainty.  As his customer looks more like a beast than an average man, the forewarnings that affected him before arrival suddenly seem to bear more weight.  As the nights proliferate, Harker is victim to several strange, dream-like exchanges with the count; impacted, too, is Lucy, who is saddled by a recurring nightmare of future desolation.\n\tBy 1979, there had already been several adaptations of Bram Stoker's classic novel (or, at least, several works indebted to the source), making Dracula a figure so recognizable and so familiar that the public, in no doubt, were past automatically recoiling in fear at the mention of the villain's name.  Herzog's adaptation alters familiarity so painstakingly that the story no longer hints at mundane repetition.  His art design, so eerily dank and so intrinsically saturated, evokes alarm that never settles down; the film is an expertly sculpted mood piece as contemporarily artistically pulsating as it is distinctly old-fashioned.  Like a silent movie, it doesn't seem to be of this Earth, existing in a separate galaxy in which evil proves to be almost apocalyptic in power.  Herzog's direction is nothing short of transcendentally brilliant.\n\tMost haunting about \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" is its final act, whereby Dracula eventually does make his way into Harker's German town and therefore leads the city into ghastly chaos.  As citizens roam around the premises looking lost, fires burn left and right, animals, especially rats, scattered about as if to reflect unsalvageable humanity.  It is this stretch of hopeless pandemonium that best summarizes the film's atmosphere - it's one where our existential fears cause irreversible imbalance in our stability, and that's more terrifying than any blood drinking creature could ever be.\n\tStill, Kinski as Dracula is pretty paralyzing; the role is transformative for the temperamental actor, who, despite his famously unpredictable emotional palette, sat through agonizing four hour long makeup application sessions without putting up a fuss.  Avoiding mimicking the easily schlocky performances of Lugosi and Christopher Lee, Kinski is better in sync with Max Schreck characterization in the 1922 film, utilizing ghostly bodily movement and minimal facial expression as a way to convey the idea that Dracula is more of an entity than he is an outright being.  Resulting is a disturbing performance that stands as one of the best of Kinski's career - here is a role that begs to be enacted with the mindset of a stage actor, hammy and mockable, and yet Kinski brings it to life with phantasmic determination.\n\tSupported by the flawlessly cast Adjani, whose glassy beauty imitates the untouchable attractiveness of a silent screen siren, and a convincingly heroic Ganz, \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" epitomizes that rare ideal that onscreen terror can be lush and richly designed, a feature regularly ignored in a genre that prefers ugliness to poeticism.  Herzog has outdone himself.",

A story of love, blood, death and loneliness, with a masterful Klaus Kinski, who plays a penned Dracula in his castle and in its melancholy, a melancholy due to his loneliness.

His vision of the 1922 classic is an incredible masterpiece. Its tone and gloomy atmosphere defines horror and the end of times as Count Dracula spread his terror and this time with no legal issues. Set in Gothic Germany, the film follows the basic plot and key characters of a Dracula film. If you have seen the original Dracula, you know what is to happen. Artistically shot and vision by Herzog, the film is pure poetry which is what imagine Herzog's films like. The film is not without its terrific performances Klaus Klinski as Count Dracula, Isabelle Adjani as Lucy Harker, Bruno Ganz as Johnathan Harker, and Walter Ladengast as Van Helsing. Klinksi's Count Dracula is a solemn heinous and evil with much disgust and creepy. His encounter with Lucy is one of my favorite.",

Max Schreck was creepier, but Kinski is his usual unusual self. I swear that guy could host Sesame Street dressed as a yellow happy face and holding a box of muffins and he'd still make me feel uncomfortable in my own skin. The thing I like most about his performance is the way he moves. Where every other vampire is a man with supernatural powers, this Count Dracula does seem like he's more vampire bat than vampire-human. If people didn't keep saying that his skin feels cold I wouldn't have even thought he was undead, even though that's kind of necessary for the vampyre mythos.",

This follows the actual Dracula story quite well, and like the novel the best part is Jonathan Harker making his way toward the count and his grim fate. Klaus Kinski's is superb as the foul monster, and even though I found him very amusing in parts there's still something very creepy about the design. The stunning Isabelle Adjani is also fantastic as Lucy Harker who fits the role better than anyone else could.

            "content": "This is a horror films. If you expectNosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (1979)\nThis is a horror film. With the genre of horror having been corrupted, you have to dig down in the film history to look what horror films are about. What we are served today is scary music with scary make-up and loud sounds and sudden scary visuals. Thus making the movie a scary movie- not a horror one. Be it a cute baby or scary ghost- anyone suddenly screaming 'AAGGHHHH' and springing right on the screen IS going to be scary.\nThus Werner Herzog's Nosferatu, a remake of F.W. Murnau's classic 1922 silent horror-fest Nosferatu, classifies as a horror film. Set in the 19th Century, the film revolves around Count Dracula of Transylvania. The Count's need and want to consume the good and spread the evil can ring a bell across various historical aspects.\nHaving spoken ill of the current horror-genre, to my dismay, even the vampire-genre has been infected. I did not dislike any current vampire-movie until I saw this particular movie. Vampires are not cool dudes who are bored with life. I am not basing the vampire-genre solely on the Twilight series though. I am yet to see Jim Jarmusch's ' Only Lovers Left Alive'. But to generalise the vampires of the 21st Century- there are just lame swaggers. \nOne has to see this movie for the make-up. Nothing extravagant but powerful enough to highlight the characters in the movie. Make-up done on Count Dracula is obviously great and appropriate but that done on Lucy Harker is also subtle but shows the frail lady who one assumes to be weak.\nSpecial shout goes to my now favourite 'actor in negative role' Klaus Kinski. He doesn't yell or shout so much in the films. Though the way he stealthily approaches victims and disappears is not only a fabulous directorial feat but also showcases Klaus's acting skills. His cold eyes sends tremors down your spine- his vicious dialogues will scare you for a fortnight. \nFinally the director- Werner Herzog. I haven't seen the original version so I do not know which one is better but this movie is an amazing feat in itself. The way the director has used lights is great. The way every character moves out into the dark only to reappear in the spot-light to deliver the dialogue raises the feeling of suspense. You always wonder from where next would Count Dracula emerge from next- thus making every other scene a min-climax. The way his panoramic shots show 'Transylvania' makes you think that 'I would love to visit it but when Count Dracula is not around'. Also the end- I don't know whether he has borrowed it from the original movie but it is like you expect it but don't want to see\nThus Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (1979) is a proper vampire-horror movie. It doesn't give you nightmares (at least I hope it doesn't) but gives you the chills. It tells you to be wary of vampires- not fall in love with them. It serves as guide to vampire genre but is misread by current directors. It's a movie you have to see. You may like it but there is a possibility you may not because it is not a movie that sends your heartbeats up in an instant- but rather raises them gradually. One should watch it to understand vampires, one should watch it to understand horror films.",

            "content": "It's widely accepted that F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent film \"Nosferatu\" is one of the greatest horror films of all time. The epic scene of actor Max Schreck rising from his coffin is easily one of the most frightening moments captured on celluloid. Francis Ford Coppola even mimicked it for his big-budget 1992 adaptation, \"Bram Stoker's Dracula.\" The very look of Count Orlock has been imitated in cult favorite vampire films like \"Subspecies\" and the 1979 TV mini-series \"Salem's Lot.\"\n\n\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" is a perfect example of cinematic genius and a remake that reverently improves on the original in some aspects. Every scene found in the film drips with chilling atmosphere and historic accuracy. For 107 minutes, Director/Writer Herzog transports us to the year 1850 and takes us on a journey from Wismar, Germany into the Carpathian Mountains and then back to Wismar, where a horrific plague is the perfect cover for Count Dracula's (Klaus Kinski) insatiable hunger.\n\n\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" is rated PG for violence, sensuality, and frightening/intense scenes. There's not as much blood and graphic brutality as you would expect from a horror movie made in the late 1970s. Herzog relied on the mood he set for each sequence, leaving the gore and violence off-screen and to your imagination. There's no nudity or sex scenes, although Dracula does some suggestive touching as he feeds on his prey. We're also privy to some heavy breathing by both the vampire and his victim.\n\nIt's extremely evident \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" is Werner Herzog's grand homage to the original silent film. It was the Director's way of bringing the masterpiece to the big-screen in a way F.W. Murnau could've only imagined when he made the original: in color, featuring audio, and using the actual names of the characters found in Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" novel. Murnau was never allowed to do this because Stoker's widow wouldn't give him permission. It's Herzog's ultimate tribute to what he considers \"the greatest film ever to come out of Germany.\"\n\nhttp://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",

            "content": "As Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror is one of my all-time favourite horror films and Nosferatu the Vampyre is a remake considered to be a horror classic also, I found it to be an absolute necessity that I see the latter.\n\nThe thing about a remake like Nosferatu the Vampyre is that it serves as a remake of a black-and-white silent film and yet is in colour and has actors talking, so the experience of the two films has a lot of difference.  Director Werner Herzog knows this and decides to take certain elements from the original film and add in his own touch to the story. The thing is that he maintains a lot of what made the original film great and expands upon it which is just what a good remake needs to do. For instance, it relies very little on dialogue which maintains the silent film style of Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror, and Werner Herzog cleverly implements it in through a subtle way which renders the style of the film powerful and therefore is of a much more classical horror form. Nosferatu the Vampyre is reliant less on dialogue than it is on atmosphere, and in a generation which tries to create thrills through excess of blood and gore instead of atmosphere most of the time, it is great to look back at Nosferatu the Vampyre and realise what horror films are all about.\nThe extensive scene where Jonathan Harker journeys to Count Dracula's castle shows off a lot of the powerful visual elements and it establishes the atmosphere for the film. In these scenes, Jonathan Harker is alone and isolated from the rest of the world, approaching a location he has been told to avoid yet going ahead and doing it anyway, and the film really encourages the idea that he is alone and distant from anyone else in the world. The scenery gradually grows more and more grim which makes the mood of the film feel even darker, and so Nosferatu the Vampyre has an atmosphere which develops at an excellent pace and is full of excellent development, so Nosferatu the Vampyre proves that Werner Herzog is a mastermind of storytelling. The story of Dracula has been told countless times and has gotten stale for me by this point, but the atmosphere in Nosferatu the Vampyre and the haunting way that it separates itself from other adaptations through its film style is just stunning. Nosferatu the Vampyre is one of the most innovative adaptations of the story Dracula to date, and as a remake of the horror masterpiece Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror it is one of the finest remakes that I have ever seen.\nNosferatu the Vampyre is a serious technical achievement for Werner Herzog. The scenery in Nosferatu the Vampyre is masterful and the production design is also. While maintaining a grim sense of grey in its colour, it also reinforces the time period of the film. So it is convincing as well as dark, and the sights of the film are pretty nice, such as the depiction of the Borgo Pass and Dracula's castle. The film has a subtle sense of colour underneath the greyish tones of the film, so it has a great visual aesthetic to it.\nThe cinematography in Nosferatu the Vampyre is powerful. As well as capturing the stunning scenery and production design of the film, it tends to keep things distant from the characters as part of a classical film style. Instead of spending so much time zeroing in on their facial expressions, most of the time in Nosferatu the Vampyre the cinematography keeps everything at a distance as a way of encouraging the feel of isolation in the movie. The characters seem so distant from us, and that reinforces a feel of general distance from everything. We are in two universes, the one we live in and the one in the movie. We are separated from everything and view it from a third person perspective, just was we did in films from the classical era.\nBut one of the best visual elements of Nosferatu the Vampyre  is the design of Count Dracula. All the characters in the film have great costumes, but none of them look precisely as chilling as Count Dracula. Instead of taking on the look of Dracula from many other adaptations, Werner Herzog continues with his intention to pay tribute to Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror and bases the design for the character off of Count Orlok. The result is amazing and so chilling that it is the source of so much horror in the film. While it is not as effective as Count Orlok because he had a stare which pierced the screen and looked into the soul of viewers, it is still chilling in its own way. It is a very eerie appearance which is creepy and accurate due to dedication to detail in his face and his hands and such. There is one scene where he stares at the audience and he achieves a similar effect to the one Count Orlok did. It isn't as effective, but it is still powerfully haunting. So the design of Count Dracula in Nosferatu the Vampyre is spot on and unforgettable.\nThe subtle musical score of the film also gives the film the appropriate intense mood. It is used at the perfect moments to make things in Nosferatu the Vampyre feel intense in a very darkly manner. It was a nice touch and although the film was not over-reliant on it, it used it at key times to ensure that the atmosphere achieved the necessary feel.\nKlaus Kinski is just perfect in the role of Count Dracula. He has a few lines in the film, but most of the importance comes from his physical acting. And in a role made famous by Max Schreck, he manages to breathe some refreshing life into the part. Giving a performance of near identical quality, Klaus Kinski captures the eerie rat-like nature of the character and combines it with his haunting ghoul elements and creates a perfect identity for the figure. He looks spectacular in the role and acts his way through it powerfully with a constantly haunting stare and tricky little movements in his hands and facial expressions. Klaus Kinski is perfect in the role of Count Dracula and gives one of the best performances as the character to date.\nIsabelle Adjani has a natural beauty to her which makes it easy to see how she becomes the product of Count Dracula's affections, and her line delivery is great because she constantly seems in a state of fear without going melodramatic about it. Her performance shows her ability to creat energetic charisma in dark territory which she manages to execute very powerfully. She has a natural charm and sophistication in her part, and she creates a fearful character very well.\nBruno Ganz was also terrific as Jonathan Harker because of the way he had a subtle heroic nature to him which didn't overthrow his own form of realistic humanity and instead was simplypresent as a subtle theme within him. He develops and changes as the story progresses and does it at a very impressive rate, gradually. Bruno Ganz stands strong for the majority of the first half of Nosferatu the Vampyre, and even in the second half where he receives much less screen time he makes a firm impact with his character. Bruno Ganz does a great job.\n\nSo although it doesn't precisely measure up to the quality of the original, Nosferatu the Vampyre is a stunning and bold remake thanks to a powerful cast and excellent direction from Werner Herzog which makes it the greatest remake I have ever seen in my life.",

The performances are strong (though clearly held back in the English version due to it not being the actors' native language) and Kinski stands out in his own chilling way. The dialogue is as doomy as you'd like and feels well-written too and the camera shots are also what you'd expect from Herzog. It's a faithful recreation that has its own merits over the previous work but there's not enough of Kinski here and it's more sympathetic towards Dracula than I would have liked. \n\nWorth watching for Kinski's blinder of a performance but certainly not the best Herzog film out there.

Sadly, not many people know about this one, or have seen it. Even those who have heard of it are quick to denounce it because it's a remake to the classic.\n\nThe plot of this film is a bit closer to Bram Stoker's Dracula than the original. This is clearly because Werner Herzog could get the rights. The main difference is that all the character's names are back to the book's originals. This isn't a bad thing, It's actually good. It shows that it wasn't trying to clone the original.\n\nOne thing that I love is the makeup. Cinema Maniac made a good point when he said how Orlok looks like a bat. The same is shown here. Best vampire makeup of all time.\n\n(I may be wrong on the following paragraph, but I think I've got it right)\n\nAs I said, Nosferatu was a lost film for a very long time. This version, I believe, was made while it was lost, so that makes it a non-pointless remake.\n\nThere is really nothing more I can say. Anything good with the classic is still present here.

What looks like amateur camera jerks and unsmooth camera movements comes across as an unsettling style that helps with the tone of the film. I love the shadowy shots when Herzog did a close up on Kinski, and a lot of the landscape shots were very impressive. I loved the pacing; Herzog really took his time with the editing. He didn't quickly cut away to something else if it seemed to drag; he just hold on the wide two shot typical of silent films and German Expression, yet seem so fresh when Herzog does them. I love the seemingly pointless yet visually interesting shots, such as the shot where clouds are just moving by and looming in. In terms of the acting, it's alright. Klaus Kinski's chilling and stunning performance and his ability to capture the fragility of who is Dracula was probably the best performance in the whole film. Bruno Ganz as Jonathan Harker was alright; he had his moments. I thought Isabelle Adjani's acting was rather wooden, as I thought was so of the rest of the cast, with the exception of Kinski and Ganz. I thought the guy who played Renfield did an alright job, although at times I felt he was playing more of a caricature than an actual character, and his character was thrown away towards the end, but I didn't mind it at much. The movie had better things to focus on. I didn't always know (and I think neither the audience with me knew) if you were supposed to be laughing at or with the characters in delivering their lines. For example, the exchange between the old man and the officer, when the officer tells the old man to arrest Van Helsing. In addition, why Van Helsing couldn't tell what was going on, yet there were obviously vampire bites on the people's necks, but I rest my case. I don't think the whole thing about Nosferatu was well developed or that they didn't figure out at the end that Dracula was a vampire; I mean he's got pointed ears, long fingernails, and pointy teeth. Overall, visually stunning, great pacing, alright acting, and some logistical issues I can forgive. Although it is a direct homage to the 1922 film (which I sadly have not seen yet), it certainly can stand on its own as well.",

            "content": "**** out of ****\r\n\r\nYou know a classic film is close to somebody's heart when, to the Americans, it is foreign; but to the person describing the film, it is native - and yet the person goes on to describe it as the best motion picture ever to come out of their home country. In the case of Werner Herzog - that daring ground-breaker of a filmmaker - F.W. Murnau's \"Nosferatu\" is the best German production ever to grace the silver screen. Nobody just says something like this for the hell of it; Herzog especially must have his good reason for loving the classic, spectacularly spooky (and loose) adaptation of Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\"; just as we all do. Given his admiration for the original film, you know where he's going with \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\", which serves as a very close, faithful, and highly successful remake of the Murnau film rather than another old adaptation of the age-old story.\r\n\r\nSince the original, 1922 \"Nosferatu\" was celluloid terror written in Gothic black-and-white visuals and architecture, make-up effects that were decidedly way ahead of its time, and a unique take on a classic tale of vampirism; there were indeed things that were in need of updating, as well as things that probably should have been left alone. Luckily, Herzog sees everything; from the world to the movies that he watches, and he knew what had to be done. What he offers up is a visual update of the story, filled with his own stylistic touches. He also provides a more emotionally resonant vampire than that of the original \"Nosferatu\". I cannot say whether it improves on the Murnau film or not; all I know is that it certainly doesn't dishonor it, and that's all that matters.\r\n\r\nSure enough, not much has changed plot-wise; although this time, Herzog is able to avoid the copyright issues that Murnau faced when making the original; thus, he's able to use the character names brought up in Bram Stoker's classic novel. Most of the time, the story is familiar (given that some stuff differentiates; but not too much), but Herzog laces it with enough spectacle and atmosphere to make up for any form of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \r\n\r\nA real-estate agent, Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz), is sent from his native land of Wismar, Germany to the obscure and mountainous regions of Transylvania. It is there that he shall meet a client interested in purchasing a new home in Wismar; Count Dracula is his name. The journey is long and complicated; but Jonathan is able to make it to the Count's large-but-creepy castle in one piece. He arrives at night; which is, as we learn, a good time for the Count (Klaus Kinski), as he seems to resent the daytime hours. He allows Jonathan to stay in his home for a few days and a few nights so that the proper paperwork can get dealt with; and also so that the two can get more properly acquainted.\r\n\r\nAs we've been brought up to expect from this legendary story; the Count is a vampire. But Jonathan does not believe in such creatures; regardless of the various warnings given to him by a few gypsy-types on his way to the estate. His beliefs will be put to the test when the classic clich\u00e9s and tropes of vampirism will come alive when he observes the Count's behavior and actions from a distance. Think of it: nobody knows where he sleeps; he never shows during the day; his skin is pale, his head bald; his teeth resemble that of a rat, and his ears a bat; and his fingernails are long and slender. If that isn't enough to convince Jonathan that his newest customer is a bloodsucking devil, then I haven't a single idea what is.\r\n\r\nHere is what happens from then on: the Count samples the blood of Jonathan, becomes entranced by a photograph of his beautiful wife (who is at home) whose name is Lucy (Isabelle Adjani), locks him in the house the next morning, and stows away onto a ship headed for Wismar via coffin, his favorite method of transportation next to the boat the delivers him. And when the boat enters the harbor of Wismar; Herzog is at his prime. The image of the ship containing Count Dracula yet again coming into contact with land and bringing death-by-plague - not to mention an entire rat infestation - to wherever it may anchor. Above all, I think that Herzog displays his affection for storytelling through the imagery of his films; which often takes the place of narrative conventions and plot. If anything, I think the film is visual storytelling at its finest.\r\n\r\nAside from the suitably intoxicating scenes taking place inside the remarkably Gothic castle of Count Dracula; what gives the film its beauty is the humanity in the Dracula character himself. I think it's rather surprising how, when looking at horror movie history, the most humanity comes not from actual human beings; but rather the creatures - however humanoid they may be - which are labeled by society as monsters. Kinski portrays the Count as lonely, loveless, and unable to die; a horrible combination of the three. He cannot ease his pain as the mortals of the world can; he sees his vampirism as a curse, and one that he cannot uplift. I didn't see such depth in the original film; although perhaps I saw something more all-together and therein lays the magic of Herzog's \"Nosferatu\" remake. It isn't Murnau's \"Nosferatu\"; it is purely Herzog's movie, and he makes that known through scenes that depict a sort of spiritual connection with nature, architecture, and location. Then again, maybe that's just Herzog's own relationship with his style of filmmaking. I recognize that this is an impossible bond to break; the sign of a true artist, more or less.",

In 1850, estate agent Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) is sent to Transylvania to finalise a property deal with Count Dracula (Kinski), who is wishing to buy some property in the German town of Wismar. Harker travels out to Transylvania, leaving his young wife Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) behind. The Count is a strange, eccentric man indeed, white skin with long fingernails and a face like a rodent, but he learns of Lucy, and back in Wismar, Lucy experiences nightmares. Harker starts to lose his mind while staying with the Count. After the Count makes his way to Wismar, the town goes into a sullen depression, with people thinking it's a plague sweeping the town. Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Walter Ladengast) investigates why this is happening. It's a very atmospheric film, but it's not a conventional horror film, especially if it's Herzog at the helm. Kinski makes his Dracula a sad, lonely outcast who only wants to be recognised. It has some brilliant scenes and set-ups in it, the sort that only Herzog could dream up.",

            "content": "Of Course, Werner's Sympathy Is With the Vampire  \r\n\r\nWhen people owe me money, I generally prefer to be paid back in things off my Amazon list.  And so yesterday, I got a package which included the complete Herzog/Kinski box set.  This was the film from it I was most looking forward to, though I'm also excited about [i]My Best Fiend, Klaus Kinski[/i], Werner's documentary tribute to his muse.  After all, I have always wanted to know why they agreed to make a second movie together, much less a fifth.  I admit that this film isn't exactly in the holiday spirit, or at least not this particular holiday season, but I'm still delighted to have finally had the chance to see it without Skipping Ahead.  It's been on my list of movies which made me want to, and I've been firm about not.  Unfortunately, this only seems to include the German-language version, not the English-language version he made at the same time, so I won't be comparing them any time soon.\r\n\r\nThough Herzog has mostly restored the names, what we have here is the not-quite-[i]Dracula[/i] created by F. W. Murnau when he was trying to dodge copyright laws.  Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) is sent by his employer, Renfield (Roland Topor), to Transylvania to the castle of Count Dracula (Kinski, of course).  The locals, of course, tell him not to go near the castle, but Jonathan will get a commission upon selling the Count a house in Delft--one, as it happens, just a few blocks from his own house.  Eventually, Jonathan figures out exactly what's going on with the Count, but he is taken ill with brain fever and cannot get to Delft in time to warn his wife, strangely called Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) in this version.  The Count comes to Delft, bringing with him rats and the Black Death.  Lucy tries to convince Dr. Van Helsing (Walter Landengast) of what's going on, but he refuses to believe her.  In the end, she is the only one who knows how to defeat the creature, because she is the only one who knows what it is.\r\n\r\nI still haven't seen the Murnau, though I have seen [i]Shadow of the Vampire[/i].  I'm going backwards in time on this one, I suppose.  Werner considers [i]Nosferatu[/i] the most important film in German cinema--and he means the Murnau, not his own.  It's why he so desperately wanted to remake it.  And merely putting in four hours a day in the makeup chair must have been a nice change for Kinski over [i]Aguirre[/i].  Werner was even willing to film simultaneously in English and German to appease the money people.  (There are distinct differences between the two versions nonetheless; apparently, the English-language version avoids the accidental appearance of Dracula in a mirror.)  The makeup is exactly like that in the Murnau film; certain of the scenes are shot-for-shot.  However, unlike the failed [i]Psycho[/i] experiment, those who have seen both do still consider the remake to be a worthy film.  Part of it is pitch-perfect casting, I suspect; Klaus Kinski is a much better Dracula than Vince Vaughn could ever be a Norman Bates.\r\n\r\nI've read that Werner horribly mistreated the thousands of rats he imported for his vision.  At bare minimum, there is the problem that he was unable to get anything other than white lab rats for the filming, and he wanted big, ugly plague rats.  So they died them.  This can't have been fun for the rats, though I doubt it literally required boiling them, as one person apparently claims.  It's certainly true that it's easier to feel sorry for the horses killed making [i]Heaven's Gate[/i] than any rats killed making this, and I read a suggestion that a bigger problem might be what happened to Delft based on the near-certainty that some of the rats got loose and were never rounded up again.  But for starters, I would want more than one person's word that the whole thing actually happened.  It seems odd to me that even Werner would need 11,000 rats for this.  Though of course he would use more rats than any other filmmaker, because cheap tricks to make it look like there are more are beneath him.\r\n\r\nKlaus Kinski does not sparkle.  He was, apparently, quite nice to makeup artist Reiko Kruk, I assume because four hours can stretch, and you don't want to anger the person in charge of that.  Pissing off the director and the locals?  One thing.  The makeup artist?  Stay on their good side!  He plays a very Werner vampire, possibly a very [i]German[/i] vampire.  As with \"Max Schreck\" in [i]Shadow of the Vampire[/i], this is a creature tired of living.  He is immortal, but that isn't necessarily a good thing.  He is tired.  He is lonely.  He cannot experience most of the things which make life worth the living.  After all, when you imagine living forever, there are certain things you just assume will be true, and they aren't for him.  It's also worth noting that it isn't merely sun which does it for Werner's vampires; that would change quite a lot of the movie.  It's being distracted by a woman who is pure of heart to ignore the cock's crow.  And even then, he doesn't turn to dust.  He just finally comes to an end.",

The story is relatively the same, but the atmosphere is surprisingly different.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the incredible atmosphere is the only saving grace for this film.  I've watched both the English and German versions, and even though the German version is mildly better, simply because the actors are more comfortable acting in their own language, they each suffer from one major issue: lethargy.\r\n\r\nThe film is incredibly slow.  I understand being creative with timing and visuals, but staring at a ship come in to port for what seemed like five minutes was not my idea of setting a scene.\r\n\r\nThe sound is also pretty mediocre, with voices sounding a little muffled and the music going down a similar path.\r\n\r\nKlaus Kinski is inspired casting for Nosferatu.  The man was surely disturbed in real life, so who better for the role of a blood drinking introvert.\r\n\r\nThis is a decent attempt at remaking a highly studied and beloved classic horror film, but it simply doesn't hold a candle to the dark and mysterious original.\r\n\r\nFilm aspects (out of 10):\r\n\r\nStory: 8\r\nCinematography: 7\r\nSound: 6\r\nActing: 8",

Count Dracula is not some abhorent monster but a tragic figure condemned to exist as a twilight figure between life and death. When FW Murnau filmed his version of Nosferatu he created an expressionist masterpiece that is still worth watching today. What must have seemed frightening then is now little more than a curiosity but the human tragedy behind the story is always palpable.\n\nWhat Werner Herzog did with his remake of the classic is to take both the content and structure of the original to create a modern expressionist version of the story. Although he is very fatihful to the Murnau film some of the 'flaws' from he original are now ironed out, for instance the names are back to those in the book and there are no sunlight shadows when Dracula walks across the town at night. Klaus Kinski, Bruno Ganz and Isabelle Adjani are all outstanding in their roles and the whole atmosphere seems to improve on the original.\n\nI watched this as a double bill with the Murnau version first and the Herzog version afterwards. I think the latter improves on the original but this may be partly due to my dislike of the techno soundtrack on the Murnau DVD.\n\nThe third in this series would of course be Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula version with a great Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins but a rather poorly cast Keanu Reeves...\n\nSo here is my verdict: Watch this unhurried and in context with the original and if you don't expect action or horror but seek great acting and style you shall find your rewards...",

            "content": "The original Nosferatu was a true masterpiece of the silent screen, and remains one of the all time great horror movies.  Werner Hertzog's 1979 remake is no substitute, but it is an excellent film in its own right.  Hertzog was and is a great fan of the original, and his version is faithful to it, while at the same time bearing all the hallmarks of his direction.\r\n\tThe storyline remains much the same as in the original- which was itself taken from Dracula- but has been greatly fleshed out, with greater character development and more explanation of several plot points. It does begin to diverge later on though, with Lucy (formerly Nina) playing a greater role and Jonathan far more effected by his ordeal.  I will admit that the ending is somewhat confusing, but once you understand it, it may be the most chilling part of all.\r\n\tHertzog has assembled an excellent cast.  Bruno Ganz plays Jonathan as young, energetic, and supremely confident, then as a bewildered man who sees the approach of his death, and finally as a frail amnesiac, and is convincing at every stage.  His wife Lucy (the gorgeous Isabelle Adjani) is one of the strongest, most determined women on the screen. She is frightened, but willing to do what must be done, with or without help.  Comparisons to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley (who incidentally appeared the same year) would not be inappropriate.  And Roland Topor's Renfield is as nutty as ever, raving about how \"blood is life,\" and punctuating every sentence with an annoying giggle.\r\nBut it's Klaus Kinski's brilliant portrayal of the count that steals the show.  In the original, he was a complete monster, utterly repulsive and existing only to feed.  Here, Dracula still inspires revulsion, and is unspeakably evil, but he is given real emotions, and we are reminded that he was human, once. This Dracula is as pitiful as he is powerful, and thirsts for companionship as much as blood.  He speaks of how horrible it is to live forever without growing old, and perhaps part of him wishes for the death he brings to others.  He also seems to be more than a bit mad, which should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with Kinski.\r\nOne of the strengths of the original film was its understanding that leaving things to the viewer's imagination can be more powerful than showing every gory detail.  Hertzog has taken this lesson to heart.  He uses the vampire's shadow to create dread, and instead of showing Dracula ripping out someone's throat, he cuts to the next sequence, allowing our imaginations to run wild.\r\nAnd as in any of the director's films, the production values and visual style are superb. Instead of the minimal exterior sets so common to the genre, we are given location shots of quaint villages, remote mountains, and imposing castles.  Much of the footage is so good it could be used in a tourism campaign.  The interior sets are complex and well lit, and the period costumes outstanding. Never do we get the feeling that we are looking at a modern recreation of nineteenth century Europe, rather than the real thing.\r\n\tThe spread of the plague and its effect on society is also interesting to watch, morbid as that may sound. From the moment Dracula steps off the boat in Germany, he is accompanied by dozens of rats, which become hundreds, and then thousands, with the number deaths growing at the same rate.    When Lucy goes to city hall for help, she is informed that the mayor is dead and the town council disbanded. The square outside is an endless procession of caskets winding their way between circles of ring-around-the-rosy.  \r\nA little later, we are treated to the sight of several well dressed people feasting at a table in the street, completely oblivious to the swarms of rats scurrying around their feet.  They have all contracted the plague, they explain, and seek to enjoy themselves until death comes.  In the very next shot, we see the same table, minus the people, and with the rats devouring the remnants of their meal.  It seems they did not have long to wait.\r\nNosferatu- Phantom der Natch succeeds both as a tribute to the early days of German expressionist filmmaking, and as a modern spine tingle.  I would highly recommend it to any horror fans, preferably after seeing the original.",

However, the film is not convincingly period due to some missed details regarding the sets and has a very 1970s Germany TV movie look to it, most likely due to color palette and few custom sets.

He is genuinely terrifying; the scene when he ominously glides down the hallway to Harker's room and then corners the realtor in his bed is harrowing.  Isabelle Adjani is operatically emotional; the expression on her face (as shown in the mirror) when Dracula confronts her at her vanity is one of the greatest moments in the whole film.  Bruno Ganz is wonderful as the evolutional Harker, and Roland Topor's giggling, psychotic Renfield is a triumph.

Herzog again teams up with the amazingly mad Klaus Kinski who plays Count Dracula (Herzog drops the names from Murnau's film, which were used to avoid copyright disputes with Bram Stoker's novel). Herzog creates a vision of nature in conflict with society--fogs and clouds harbor other worlds and infiltrate the mind, and we watch as society slowly begins to crumble. Herzog focuses upon the disintegration of society in the town, which becomes like an image of bedlam, as the vampire's curse claims victim after victim. Plus, Herzog throws some twists into the story that you might not expect. Overall, it is a masterful interpreation of the story that uses artistry to create a creepy vibe in which nature itself seems to be haunted and waiting to sink its teeth into us. Simultaneously, Kinski portrays Dracula as a man as well as a demon, a man who is torn apart by immortality and who lurches sadly through the ages in the dark and alone. It is a powerfully existential portrayal of the human condition and one of the truly great interprestations of the character of Count Dracula.",

It's a film of archetypal horror, but also one of the only times where the audience truly sympathizes (in a most unsettling way) with the monster. From the very first frame, Herzog establishes a dream-like atmosphere wherein nature's terrifying and uncanny power is brought to the fore via the director's unsurpassed visual eye. You FEEL the forces of evil and loss pass through the screen and enter your heart. As a film, it's deeply unsettling and poetically beautiful in the same, glorious instances. A masterpiece. (Makes The Shining look like The Grudge.)",

Count Dracula's castle doesn't even look like one (even a dilapidated one).\r\n\r\nHowever, it is otherwise fantastically creepy.  Not the type that will give you nightmares, but a ravishing kind of gothic macabre.  I'll just single out two things that grabbed my attention: the script and Lucy.  The script does not try very hard for realism: literary is the best adjective there is I think.  The plot is rather predictable and very spare, but with such a script this feels like a fairy-tale experience and I became just drawn into its surreal universe.  Its closest kin still alive is probably classical theatre script.  Lucy I will not presume to decide whether she is a beauty, but she reminds me of those pre-Raphaelite females, which is very apt given the vaguely 19th-Century setting (and that Victorian hairbun!).  That makes her into \"a woman pure of heart\" who \"could makes [vampires] forget the first crow of the cock\"; absolutely ethereal in spite of all the downbeatness of it all.",

Nonetheless, several moments prove unique to the Herzography (the arrival of a ghost ship in a town soon overrun with rats; rows and lines of coffins being manoeuvred into place, like dancers in a Busby Berkeley routine), and - given the sudden shift into generic territory - there's a surprising level of continuity with the rest of the this director's CV: the same dreamy, misty atmosphere as to be found in Herzog's key 70s fictions, seductive interiors and Alpine photography, another eerie Popul Vuh score.",

But if you were to ask me what I thought was the greatest vampire movie ever made, I would pick F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent horror classic Nosferatu: A Symphony of Terror. Nosferatu is the sort of horror film that is so great that there really was no need for a remake version to be made. But Werner Herzog's 1979 remake is one of those rare instances where a needless remake, which doesn't outdo the original in any way, manages to come out on top and not come off as an insult to the film it is a remake of.\r\n\r\nThere is a fine line between paying homage to and just plain mimicking. Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre acts as a nice homage to the original, and in some fashion it's a nice little companion piece to the 1922 version. Herzog didn't make a full on remake, but his film isn't some complete re-imagining. Herzog picked the best parts of the original film, faithfully recreating them for his film. But he also expands on things, namely his flawless efforts to humanize Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski) and make him into a sympathetic character (due to his loneliness) and not just another movie monster.\r\n\r\nI still like the performance by Max Schreck in the original Nosferatu better, but Kinski's performance is rather impressive as well. The make-up done on Kinski is fantastic, making him look like some sort of hairless rat. Kinski embodies the role, much like Schreck did, and was able to make the character much more complex than expected. Herzog and Kinski have worked together five times during their careers, and their collaboration together in this film still remains as my personal favorite.\r\n\r\nEach location in the film is beautifully selected, and the costumes are all nicely designed. So much of Nosferatu's effect relies on the atmosphere created by the look of each scene; and here is a film that swims in dark tones and moods. While I think the film succeeds visually with creating an eerie mood, some of the film's mystique is lost because this version is a \"talky picture.\" Maybe I'm just biased because I hold the original Nosferatu to such high esteem, but I think Nosferatu is a little creepier as a silent film than one with sound.\r\n\r\nStill, as far as remakes go Nosferatu the Vampyre is one that manages to stand strong. I would even go as far to call it one of the best vampire movies ever made. I've been on a sort of Werner Herzog fix ever since the first episode of the third season of The Boondocks premiered; an episode that Herzog narrates. Herzog is one of my favorite directors of all time, and a film like Nosferatu the Vampyre perfectly showcases why I love his work so much.",

It's so beautiful, but in an utterly simple and unshowy way, without lighting tricks or long lingering shots, well-represented as the work of a man who KNOWS he is an artist and does not have to prove it to anyone. Also like There Will Be Blood, there's an odd little feint at black humor that keeps the movie from feeling totally self-serious, though it works better at some junctures than others,  such as that dick playing Renfield. So annoying, and definitely not in a good way...more like a \"shrill, affected, embarrassing\" way. He really interferes with the mood of the piece, but even setting him aside, I don't think the movie is perfect. The thin, unfocused plot is sort of a distraction, and though I understand that the style is the main draw here, why not go full-blown surrealist? There's obviously a commercial hook to consider here, and as bizarre as it is to think about, this was probably an event of some magnitude back in the late 70s. Ah, remember when auteurs not named Quentin Tarantino could actually draw a crowd? \n\nKlaus Kinski is an odd, tragic Dracula, possessed of both silence and carnality. His pain is apparent but it makes him no less of a monster. Isabelle Adjani is ravishing, a presence so luminous that her purpose as a Dracula beacon seems only too clear. There's an interesting protagonist structure going on in Dracula where Lucy, Jonathan and Dracula all seem to take turns being the movie's center of attention. Though it does contribute to the movie's odd focus problem, it gives the movie the chance to re-lens itself through the perspectives of each of its characters. Jonathan is an explorer in the savage wilds of Transylvania, Dracula a shadow lurking in the night to sow the seeds of plague, Lucy a frightened but resolute heroine. The movie's tone is so diverse and captivating. A definite horror classic.",

The biggest strength of the picture are the aberrantly splendid visuals.\r\nHowever, in a manner that is reminiscent of an earlier 70's horror film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Nosferatu makes an extremely intelligent decision to shoot the film with a documentary style cinematography. The camerawork is hauntingly good, working as though capturing this movie naturally.\r\nI also enjoyed the pacing of this movie. It balances the minimal dialogue and profound imagery that moves the story along very clearly and distinctly.\r\nAnd the performances in this movie were, for the most part, remarkably good. Bruno Ganz plays Jonathon and plays the part meticulously well. There was a point when I was thinking that Count Dracula's appearance might be a little too over the top, but the way Ganz acts so frightened by the mere sight of the count during the scene really hits it home for me.\r\nAnd Klaus Kinski gives one of the most bone-chilling villain performances I have ever seen. Even when the character is just being casual Kinski chills the audience to the bones. Only a few villains have ever accomplished that, like Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader.\r\nThis was an excellent movie, and there was a great level of emotion in it, from horrifying to the dark humor toward the end. Not the masterpiece the original was, but certainly in the same league.\r\n9/10",

I don't consider this a remake at all, but a film made from the heart based on the Classic Nosferatu from 1922 by F.W.Murnau.\r\n\r\nI don't believe talking much about the plot is necessary, as educated film viewers know what they're in for and what to expect.\r\n\r\nKlaus Kinski is the pale mysterious creepy insect fanged Count here. Portrayed a bit different than the original Nosferatu, the Count is more of a lonely creature cursed with immortality.\r\n\r\nJonathan Harker , Bruno Ganz, is invited to the castle on business and well received by our noble Count. Here our more than hospitable Count gives Jonathan pleasant and comfortable accommodations. Soon Jonathan discovers The Count sleeps in a coffin during daytime and is imprisoned in his quarters. Jonathan escapes, The Count falls for Jonathan's wife Lucy, and Van Helsing arrives on the Wismark harbour by boat to save humanity.\r\n \r\nMy favourite scene in the film is when it is revealed the boat has also transported a mysterious cargo and before we know it thousands out rats invade the town square. A quite disturbing scene as we see the townsfolk dance and dine in the middle of the square, as rats crawl all over the place, and mankind clearly is driven into insanity.\r\n\r\nMostly filmed on location in the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia, the film is full of dreamlike, if not hypnotic imagery. Some viewers might consider some takes a bit long and tedious. Not to be worried, as the eerie atmospheric music by German band Popol Vuh enhances the films pace creating a most creepy mood.\r\n\r\nI'm almost certain that Nosferatu, Mario Bava's Black Sunday and several other classics are obvious influences and inspirations on Tim Burton's career.\r\n\r\nNosferatu the Vampyre was both filmed in English and German language. The English language version has some really poor inaudible dialogue and had to be dubbed as an attempt to improve the film. Therefore the proper way to view this is in German with English subtitles. I know a lot of people who think that if they wanted to read, they'd rather read a book than read subtitles. Just get over it and your efforts will be rewarded. There really isn't much dialogue anyways, so do your self a favour as the English dialogue version is plain annoying.\r\n\r\nI have the excellent DVD from our Anchor Bay friends, highly recommended with some good extras. This is one of the few films I will buy again as soon as I get a Blue Ray player.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Nosferatu the Vampyre is a film made from the heart with love and dedication, 1000 times superior to garbage like the Twilight films. \r\nTwilight is a studio product targeting on insecure teenagers and their wallets, guaranteed to make the little girls wet, and the boys prematurely ejaculate. \r\n\r\nWait a minute ... that's exploitation.... and I love exploitation flicks ... Well too late... written is written. My conclusion would make a good discussion or debate though ... don't you think?",

This is how a vampire film should sound and look. The cinematography and the soundtrack generates an atmosphere that is nothing short of breathtaking. That's not to say that this is a film full of vibrant colours and pulsating camera shots. Death and melancholy is the feel and look of this film. The imagery of Dracula's castle as clouds darken the sky. The surreal sight of a town square filled with hundreds of rats. Are all so captivating, you really can't take your eyes of the screen. Also what intrigued me was the sympathetic view of a vampire. Klaus Kinski (as Count Dracula) portrays the vampire as a lonely old man, longing for love but also longing for death. In one line in the film Dracula asks Harker \"Can you imagine enduring centuries, experiencing each day the same futilities\"  Isabelle Adjani as Lucy brings a sexual and gothic beauty to her character. The scenes between her and Kinski are truly astonishing. Though at times the film moves at a snail's pace. This can be forgiven as it is such a magnificently shot and captivating story.

Herzog again teams up with the amazingly mad Klaus Kinski who plays Count Dracula (Herzog drops the names from Murnau's film, which were used to avoid copyright disputes with Bram Stoker's novel).  Herzog creates a vision of nature in conflict with society--fogs and clouds harbor other worlds and infiltrate the mind, and we watch as society slowly begins to crumble.  Herzog focuses upon the disintegration of society in the town, which becomes like an image of bedlam, as the vampire's curse claims victim after victim.  Plus, Herzog throws some twists into the story that you might not expect.  Overall, it is a masterful interpreation of the story that uses artistry to create a creepy vibe in which nature itself seems to be haunted and waiting to sink its teeth into us.  Simultaneously, Kinski portrays Dracula as a man as well as a demon, a man who is torn apart by immortality and who lurches sadly through the ages in the dark and alone.  It is a powerfully existential portrayal of the human condition and one of the truly great interprestations of the character of Count Dracula.",

This is a thinking man's film, and it shows all the way through.  Klaus Kinski plays Count Dracula, who is much more of a lonely figure who is living with a curse, as opposed to most other vampires who relish in their immortal lives and lust for blood.  Kinski's Dracula, while thirsting for blood, wants love, which is something not easily obtained as a vampire who carts around the plague where ever he goes.\n  In the end, the film is more about human nature in the face of destruction and death, than it is about Dracula, as evidenced by the beautifully done plague scene.  The coffins being carried away, the rats invading all the doorsteps, and the final banquet held by the plague victims.  It's not as likely to appeal to the horror fans of today due to the strange pacing, toned down sexuality of dracula, and a very obvious lack of the red stuff, but it will appeal to those who love Herzog, and want to see the themes he has to bring to what is now a vital part of our culture.",

One of the creepiest movies I've ever seen, and a great horror film.\r\n\r\nWerner Herzog decided to remake the 1922 horror classic, Nosferatu (directed by F.W. Murnau). Some say that, in doing so, he created a horror classic on his own. The movie tells the story of Dracula (played by the versatile Klaus Kinski). Before you get confused, the original Nosferatu also told the story of Dracula, but Murnau couldn't get the rights from Bram Stoker's widow and ended up changing the names (for example, Count Dracula became Count (Graf) Orlok). Jonathan Harker goes to visit Dracula's castle on real estate business. The Count makes a deal with him to move to Wismar, Germany, where Harker and his wife live. While Harker is there, he realizes that Dracula is a vampire, and is attacked (maybe attacked isn't the right word since Dracula used almost no force). But it is too late, for Dracula has hidden in a coffin which is to be sent across the ocean to Wismar. When Dracula gets to Wismar, he spreads the black plague and tries to feed on Lucy Harker, Jonathan's wife (played by the hauntingly beautiful, Isabelle Adjani). That's all I'll tell you about the plot.\r\n\r\nLike I said before, this movie is just creepy. Very eerie. The use of lighting, the setting, the music, and dark imagery make this just fun to be creeped out by. Klaus Kinski is not as creepy as the original, Max Schreck, but he's still very good. He takes a different approach altogether. Kinski is more about the sad truth of life as a vampire, such as the eternal loneliness. I highly recommend it if you enjoy classic horror movies, foreign films, or just want to be creeped out.",

Dracula is able to keep his mystery and his fear while given slight humanity that is not overdone or explored to the point of forced. The character of Jonathan is justified as a human and very much believable. Lucy is also a mysterious character, with pale skin and eyeshadow, while her character is both strong and dedicated.\n \nThe story is, as mentioned, simple, keeping only three main arcs. There is much attention given to the surroundings as well as the actions of the characters, while fear is developed through the almost eerie isolation of a few sounds and the continuous religious music in the background.

The cinematography, very foggy represented too well the vampire enviroment, almost a live action surreal nightmare. Then you have Klaus Kinski as count Dracula which is as awesome as...the most awesome thing ever.",

He always seems to let the camera linger longer than is usual on any such shot evidently loving the unscripted and unpredictable. And there's plenty of it here - especially with the hundreds of white rats that invade the town. The rest of the film is good - and certainly better than Coppola's overblown version, but whether Herzog isn't the right director to properly do this story justice or whether the story is simply unfilmable, this is a case of (much) style over substance.",
