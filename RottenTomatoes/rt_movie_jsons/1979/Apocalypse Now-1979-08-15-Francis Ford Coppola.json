Set during the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) travels up the Nang River with a secret dossier in hand in search of Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a madman operating outside of military law, with instructions to remove him from his post – ‘terminate with extreme prejudice.'  It is a nightmarish, hallucinogenic, and picaresque journey filled with iconic dialogue (‘I love the smell of napalm in the morning!!') and memorable set pieces, culminating in the horrifyingly surreal final confrontation.  A must-see for anyone who loves cinema, make sure that it is the original theatrical cut that is viewed, not the recut and grotesquely bloated Apocalypse Now: Redux.",

            "content": "The film Apocalypse Now was a masterpiece of its time.  Directed/produced by Francis Ford Coppola based on a book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, and also produced by Kim Aubry and John Ashley.  The film stars main characters Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, and Robert Duval, along with Albert Hall, Sam Bottoms, and Laurence Fishburne.\n\tThe film takes place during the Vietnam war, and examines how the trauma of war can cause the human mind to commit inhumane atrocities.  Captain Willard (Sheen) is assigned to kill Colonel Kurtz (Brando), a soldier in the Army that has gone rogue.  Willard is fighting his own demons wanting desperately to leave the horrors of war only to find it keeps calling him back. He commands Kilgore (Duval), head of the Air Calvary to support him as he and his boat crew go up the river to find Kurtz. Duval shows little regard for the civilian casualties he causes in clearing out a beach area at the mouth of the river so he and his soldiers can surf. Along the way the boat crew encounters various horrific situations in their journey to Kurtz's location; various army camps lacking any supervision by officers, enemy fire at certain points, etc.  \n\tWhen the crew finally arrives at Kurtz's location, they are greeted by soldiers and civilians that follow Kurtz like a cult, killing randomly. Kurtz is well aware of the atrocities he has committed due to the trauma of the atrocities he witnessed as a soldier.  He also knows that the army sent Willard to kill him, and he wants it to happen.  After imprisoning Willard and offering readings and quotes to him trying to justify his actions, Kurtz ultimately frees Willard to follow his orders.  Willard kills Kurtz, and after the deed is done and Kurtz followers are kneeling to him is conflicted as to whether he becomes like Kurtz and takes over his cult or destroys the encampment.  Finally, Willard grabs the last remaining member of the boat crew (the others were killed in action), leaves on the boat and calls in an air strike on the encampment.\n\tCoppola stayed true to his vision to the film and the story at great personal cost.  He went way over budget with elaborate special effects and sets (renting helicopters from Phillipine government, elaborate set builds, explosions), suffered setbacks due to weather and illness (a typhoon destroyed some of the sets, Sheen suffered a heart attack while filming), and had some frustration with the actors (Brando showed up to filming overweight and unprepared). Coppola had to finance the amount that went over budget himself. Coppola also represented the soldiers realistically in the film, many of them portraying young boys drafted just out of high school (Laurence Fishburne was fourteen years old when filming began) using drugs to escape the hell they found themselves in, and in some cases having no guidance from senior officers resulting in chaotic encampments. Sheen used his personal experiences in battling his own inner demons to channel the inner torment Willard was going through leading to a masterful performance. Brando gives an eerie like performance as Kurtz. Duval also gave a great performance as Kilgore portraying his indifference to the loss of life during the war.  \nI highly recommend the film as an example of how humans can be led into such a traumatic state by the terrors of war that they can be brought to engage in inhumane behavior.     This movie is profoundly dark and the special effects, the elaborate sets, and the great performances all contribute to the horror of the story.",

            "content": "Apocalypse Now \n\nHuge fan of war movies here, but I had never seen Apocalypse Now. From the director of The Godfather 1 and 2, as well as the screenplay of The Great Gatsby, Francis Ford Coppola provides his audience with an magnificent psychological war film filled with drama. The movie's main stars include none other than Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz, Robert Duvall as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore, and a young Martin Sheen as Captain Willard. Coppola is also the main producer of the movie and one of the writers, along with John Milius. Now from doing some research, this film was by no means easy to create and produce. Francis went through mass amounts of stress just to get the film off and running. He fired his lead actor a month or so into the film to hire Martin Sheen, who at the time was going through an alcoholic breakdown. The film was also shot in the Philippines, sort of replicating an adaptation of the Vietnam War. The Filipino army was lending their war equipment to Coppola and the crew, and multiple times needed it back for real life usage. Apparently, Francis threatened to commit suicide multiple times, but decided in the end to gather 240 hours of footage, cut down over 2 years into the film we get to see today. What stood out to me about the movie was how much work was put in to just get a simple scene. The movie starts off with a napalm strike in the jungle, and it's pretty damn cool. The little things like eight helicopters flying at once over the jungle, and the lighting of certain scenes shows what Coppola was trying to convey the whole time. A thrilling, epic, suspenseful but also multiple interpretation film. The film does a great job of giving us a lot of different light, letting us think in a lot of different ways. Characters like Kurtz and Willard are so fun to pick apart because of their troubled madness. They're both mad, but in different ways. The movie takes us through a small journey to get to Kurtz, and everything is heightened along the way. Francis' ability to slowly build the film is uniquely impressive. \n\n10/10. What Coppola went through to get this film off and running, and then edited and completely finished is beyond beautiful. The movie set was so screwed up at times, but everyone found a way to get the film done and do it in fashion. I'm a huge fan of war films so it's also understandable why I enjoyed it so much. My favorite part however were the actors and how unique each of them were, and what part they played in submersing they audience deeper into the film.",

            "content": "The Vietnam War is a permanent stain on the history of American imperialism under the guise of democracy and peace, the beautiful Mekong River, and he ends up in Cambodia, where Colonel Coates established his kingdom. Colonel Coates came from a distinguished family and was a Vietnam War hero for the United States Army. However, he disappeared one day... Later, the U.S. military received word that he had become a traitor by establishing his own garrison and army in Cambodia. Willard was then instructed to pursue the execution of Colonel Coats in secret. However, Willard's journey up the river, along with the atrocities he and his comrades witnessed and experienced, the deaths, and the mental distortions of the long American and local war... If he hadn't discovered Colonel Coates, I believe he would have become the second Coates... Why then? \n\nWillard has witnessed Coates' madness in placing bodies and skulls along the path, his cold-blooded murder, his decapitation of Willard's comrades and placement of their heads in front of him, and his position as local kingmaker by the end of the film... Finally, Coates rescues him and confides in him. Finally, he begs or wishes for Willard to kill him himself, leaving the words: Drop the Bomb. Exterminate everyone... Yes, he instructed Willard to destroy the near-utopian kingdom he had constructed. Like he said, I hate a lie. What the United States military says and what he does are both lies. \n\nThe film features numerous close-ups of the beautiful Khmer country, with its lifelike ruins and statues; the Khmer kingdom has been in ashes for centuries, leaving behind these eternal ruins; however, this ruin will give birth to a new round of ashes... History continually repeats itself. Having visited Cambodia, I was also awestruck by the immense ruins of Angkor Wat, which seemed to be from another era. It was already over 40 degrees in Cambodia at the time, and it was extremely hot. However, the cool spot in the building's corridor made me feel a bit chilly. This intense sense of collision convinced me that the soul of the Khmer had never vanished; otherwise, why was the Khmer smile so vibrant? I thought Coppola did a great job with this portion of the film, because the feeling of suffocation is so unreal and you can't escape it. Perhaps this is the appeal of \"cultural fictions,\" as Roland Barthes termed them. \n\nNonetheless, war is not a work of fiction... \n\nHuman nature is perpetually so bare. Obviously, you can choose to ignore it or participate in it.",

            "content": "Francis Ford Coppola is often regarded as one of the greatest directors of our time. Apocalypse Now, even without knowing the severe challenges production faced, truly exemplifies excellent filmmaking. My only exposure to Coppola before this film was The Outsiders and watching the opening of Apocalypse Now for a film class – now I feel excited to explore the rest of his filmography. It's easy to understand why this film is so highly regarded – every scene is incredibly gripping, while the story follows a traditional structure and poses many great questions about humanity, war, morality, and civilization.\n\tTo make a film about the Vietnam War was a daunting endeavor in itself, given that almost every American had a sensitive relationship with the subject. Tackling a war film when it is still such a recent and raw experience for many is a fine line to walk. Nevertheless, Coppola, along with major players George Lucas and John Milius, believed in the project wholeheartedly and set out to make their visions come to life. The film benefits from a tight script by Milius who masterfully adapts Heart of Darkness against the backdrop of the Vietnam War. Nothing was spared and Coppola fully committed financially and mentally to film in the Philippines with sets that breathed life into the film. Practical effects make the visuals hold up extremely well even over 40 years later – it feels completely unaged. The recurring theme of imagery blended between different times are real yet still convey Willard's traumatized state of mind as he carries on the life of a soldier.\n\tMartin Sheen is brilliant in this role though he was not even originally intended for the part. There are stellar performances from a diverse cast that bring life to characters who all get significant exploration throughout the runtime. I often find that films set during a war can struggle to bring equal attention to developing supporting characters but while Martin Sheen's Willard and Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz are undoubtedly the main players, I found myself so equally enthralled with the rest of the PBR crew. Young baby-faced Laurence Fishburne is an absolute scene stealer as Tyrone \"Mr. Clean\" Miller, perhaps due to his character's youth and naivety reflecting his own bold entrance to the industry doing this film as a 14-year-old boy. Marlon Brando's legendary status is well-earned, as he is incredibly impactful even in his short screentime.\n\tEvery aspect of this film was executed with passion and determination, especially the editors who cut down over a million feet of film. Upon viewing, audiences would be hard pressed to guess that so much had gone on to threaten the film's completion and success. Heart attacks, civil war, and typhoons did little to deter the cast and crew from making a timeless masterpiece.",

            "content": "Apocalypse Now is a 1978 Military-Drama film that was written/produced/directed by Francis Ford Coppola, also written by John Milius and Michael Herr, and produced by John Ashley and Kim Aubry. This film starred Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, and Robert Duvall who were all already major stars in the industry, so it brought in a large amount of attention. Not only were the main cast stars, but many others who were up and coming in Hollywood pushed this to an all-star cast. The plot of the movie is for Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) to hunt down and kill Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) during the Vietnam War. He is accompanied by Bill Kilgore (Robert Duval) and a photojournalist (Dennis Hopper). This film is made to poke at the corruptive nature of war and futility, which we see through the narration done by Martin Sheen throughout the movie, this film also borrowed aspects of insanity, depravity, and overall horror. \nThis film used cinematography that focused on over-the-top scenes and very ambiguous attitudes towards the war with one person just wanting to go home, and another loving everything about the war. There were many parts of the movie that seemed \"off\" where you were unsure why they were added, but it played into what I believe the director was going for. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and felt it also fit with how many felt about the Vietnam war in the 70s for returning vets which still feel the impact to this day. This film depicted the dichotomy of good and evil of human nature well along with showing the realistic experiences many vets faced. This fact was shown in the movie which had previously released \"The Deer Hunter \"which I would say was more reality-based but lent to the power of this movie. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone due to its impact and overall grit that it brings through the narration, directing, and the motivations behind the film. In conclusion, this film was released at a time when people wanted and needed to know more about what the Vietnam War was about and the experiences those who were lucky enough to survive went through.",

            "content": "A Disturbing View of Vietnam\n\nThis film, released in 1979, has had avid film critics arguing whether this film was worth the price tag of $31 million or whether it fell flat in the face of natural disasters, casting mistakes, and medical emergencies. The film was an adaption of a book written in 1899 by Joseph Conrad called \"Heart of Darkness.\" This film explores the Vietnam War in ways other films like \"Full Metal Jacket\" and \"Platoon\" do not. It takes the audience on a dark journey that increasingly explores the depths and darkness of humanity, especially while engaged in war. The film is about a rogue Special Operations Colonol named Kutz (Marlon Brando) who left the military to command a rogue group of Americans and Vietnamese deep in the forests of Cambodia. A military Colonol Lucas (Harrison Ford) then calls in Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) to take care of the problem and to \"terminate with extreme prejudice.\" The film then follows the adventure that Captain Willard undertakes to find a patrol boat the take him on his mission. The other fascinating aspect of the film is the focus on the characters that Captain Willard meets on his mission. Such characters like \"Chef\" (Frederic Forrest) and \"Chief\" (Albert Hall), give dimension to the story and show different ways that soldiers in Vietnam coped with the horrors they experienced. As the crew progresses, the lines between reality and fantasy blur mainly through the implicit and explicit use of drugs. Upon arrival at Kutz' camp, Captain Willard finds a camp and village of locals and eventually has a famous confrontation with Kutz in which he sees the toll that continuously facing the dark side of humanity has taken. The film concludes with Captain Willard successfully completing his mission but leaves the audience with a disturbing glimpse into some of the horrors that must have happened in the Vietnam War. This film won multiple awards, such as the Oscar for Best Cinematography and has received praises for being a masterpiece. While some masterpieces may be easy and light to watch, this one is not and will leave the viewer wondering how humanity has survived this long if atrocities even close to this occurred.",

            "content": "El 14 de abril de 1980 en el Dorothy Chandler Pavilion en Los Ángeles, se celebraba la  52.ª entrega de los más deseados premios de la industria del cine, los premios Óscar. Cinco películas competían aquella noche por llevarse la ambicionada estatuilla, una de ellas era la cinta de la que hoy voy a hablar: Apocalypse Now. Sin embargo y como es recurrente en este tipo de premiaciones tan comerciales, esta obra maestra del cine se vio derrotada ante la cinta Kramer vs Kramer, una contendiente que si bien puede no ser mala, no estuvo a la altura de esta joyita. Episodio que volvió a repetirse casi veinte años después, (en 1998) cuando la comedia romántica Shakespeare enamorado, derrotó a la que fácilmente podría ser la mejor película bélica de todos los tiempos: Rescatando al Soldado Ryan (una ocasión que al día de hoy sigue generando mucha controversia) Pero de rescatando al soldado ryan ya hablaremos más adelante. Como iba diciendo lamentablemente esa noche todos los aplausos no se los llevó Francis Ford Coppola ni su película, pero eso da igual, porque hoy en día, más de 40 años después, todos los cinéfilos seguimos hablando de ella, la recordamos con mucho cariño, porque esta obra de arte no puede ser descrita de otra forma: es épica y alucinante, una cinta adelantada a su época, ya debatiremos si si merece el título de la mejor película bélica de la historia. La cinta, dirigida (como mencioné anteriormente) por el gran Francis Ford Coppola (El padrino 1 y 2) y protagonizada por unos jóvenes Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, y el talentoso veterano Marlon Brando, se ambienta en plena guerra de Vietnam y cuenta como el capitán Benjamin L. Willard es asignado a una misión muy importante y peligrosa a la vez: asesinar a un coronel desertor, que ha creado sus propias fuerzas especiales dentro de la húmeda selva de la neutral Camboya. El coronel, no solo ha enloquecido sino que es idolatrado por una inmensa tribu local. Esta impecable joyita, merece ser comparable con grandes producciones de la historia, porque no sólo es un gran logro en el género bélico, sino en el cine general de igual manera. Se siente como un libro, es como si se estuviera leyendo uno y de esos casos en que la película gana; es un guión tan bien escrito, con diálogos muy inteligentes inundados de frases tanto reflexivas como graciosas ocasionalmente, personajes icónicos, muy bien caracterizados y carismáticos, muy…Profundos, en lo personal se quedó en mi mente el personaje del coronel William Kilgore, el mejor personaje de la cinta, que a pesar de su reducido tiempo en pantalla, es una de las razones por las que vale la pena ver la película: vale la pena verla, aunque sea sólo por admirar a un coronel caminar tranquilo y confiado en pleno bombardeo. Y sí, con esto quiero también decir que la película trasciende por distintos géneros a la vez, de la acción más candente al drama más conmovedor, de la comedia al terror, consiguiendo ser una cinta adaptable y que elude la monotonía, en pocas palabras: no es aburrida. El sonido es un adelanto en la tecnología de ese entonces y la fotografía, ¡es espléndida!, no puedo dejar de pensar en las épicas tomas, en especial esa en la que todo un escuadrón de helicópteros sobrevuelan el mar y selva vietnamitas es emocionante; y la fabulosa banda sonora que incluye clásicos de los rolling stones y Jimi Hendrix y piezas musicales instrumentales épicas, que hacen de ésta un monumento cinematográfico. La dirección de Coppola es increíble, supo dejar plasmada su visión al máximo, el montaje no deja nada que desear y mucho que envidiar y la producción…aah, es perfecta. La película muestra la mayor miseria humana, una parte horrible del ser humano, una parte cruel y vil. Y volviendo al tema que mencioné al principio de esta reseña, ¿es Apocalypse now la mejor película bélica de la historia, o ese trofeo se lo lleva Rescatando al soldado Ryan?, la verdad es que la balanza se inclina más hacia la cinta de Spielberg, pero Apocalypse now es sin duda una de las mejores de la historia, así que lo dejaré como un empate. Ya para terminar, a quién le importa que no haya ganado el óscar, eso es cosa del pasado, y lo importante, más que el premio, es que es una cinta que seguiremos recordando a lo largo y ancho de la historia, que ya ha creado su legado y que no necesita de un premio para ser famosa y grande. 9,2/10.",

            "content": "This is certainly an atmospheric and immersive watch. I wouldn't necessarily say its one of the most memorable war films I've seen in my life overall as such but I can understand why people hold it in high regard. The use of rock and roll/rebellious type music at times and the noise of the jungle during scenes with limited dialogue stuck out to me. There is a high presence of anxiety and paranoia after a while - understandably so, given the context of the film. It does quite well in painting a picture (a sobering one, of course) of what it may have been like for soldiers allowed access to various vices and who are relied on, on the front line. Its a gritty watch and I felt Martin Sheen gave a great performance, his character seeming more vulnerable perhaps than others. \n\nThere is a definite air of suspicion which is heightened due to the incidental music in the background at times. The quirky behaviour of some people did unsettle me but I somehow didn't feel it was as poignant as perhaps I'd expected, although it is atmospheric and felt quite looming in parts. I'd say the last hour was when things got particularly arty/sinister. If your not 'into' arty type films, or films with scenes containing little dialogue, then this likely won't be for you. However, certainly due to the distinct eeriness to it, I'd say it's a film I'd recommend overall, yes.",

            "content": "(For the record, I watched the Final Cut version).\n\nLet's start here: this is a very unique movie. It's got a lot of interesting nuance and asks thoughtful questions. Of course, it doesn't really answer any of these questions, but I suppose some might consider that secondary. The technicalities of the set pieces are simply stunning, although it occasionally becomes obvious that we're looking at fireworks rather than actual missiles and whatnot.\n\nThe satire of the first act is spot-on, followed by the second act which reveals the darker side of our characters. Unfortunately, I found the third act somewhat underwhelming. Marlon Brando is great, don't get me wrong, but it just doesn't really go anywhere. The movie dilutes its own message by turning the only rebellious individual into a madman cult leader for no real reason. It also doesn't give us any reason to believe that he would be able to organically gather followers. What is he offering them? Vague babblings of poetry here and there and then occasionally chopping off some heads?\n\nAlso, this movie is LONG. It works at times because it actually feels like an extended war mission, but at other times the plot gets soooo sloooooow without really adding any benefit. I'm 100% positive that they could have cut the entire French plantation scene without hurting the movie in any way whatsoever. It doesn't further the plot, give us any additional insight into our characters, or even make us laugh. It's just awkwardly forced in seemingly only to show some boobs in this movie which I hadn't even noticed it was lacking.\n\nMy last complaint is that virtually all of the (speaking) white people survive the movie while virtually all of the (speaking) people of color die. How very progressive of you 🤦\n\nAnyway, I'm doing a lot of complaining for a movie that really is pretty good. The cast is all great, the music is like 90% awesome, and its message, while a little muddled, is engaging and thought-provoking. But the real standout in this film is its direction, which effortlessly balances thoughtful, down-to-Earth scenes with loud, exciting, tense ones. I wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made (like many folks do), but I will say it's definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "Apocalypse Now is a 1979 film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who contributed to the writing process along with screenwriter John Milius. The film is based on the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad and was produced by Francis Ford Coppola, John Ashley, and Kim Aubry. The movie stars Martin Sheen as Willard and Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz. The movie tells Willard's journey as he travels deep into the Cambodian jungle on a military assignment to assassinate Captain Kurtz, a rogue officer thought to have become a murderer. \n\tProduction highlights include dedicated direction by Coppola, committed acting from Sheen and Brando, and striking cinematography by Vittorio Storaro. Coppola is the driving force behind the production; his energy inspired all aspects of the film from both sides of the camera. Coppola's single-minded dedication to his craft made the film possible and he supported the film financially when it went over budget and past its expected timeline. Apocalypse Now is notable for its sheer scale, including large-scale war scenes with intricate helicopter choreography, and could not have been as successful without Coppola's competent direction at the helm. Sheen and Brando both worked with Coppola to develop their characters and the collaboration is evident in Willard's enigmatic introspection and Kurtz's wayward mystery. Both actors are deeply committed and their performances force viewers to engage with the film by puzzling out their characters' thoughts and motivations. \n\tStotaro won an Oscar for his cinematography in Apocalypse Now and his work is notable because of the way his unique choices contribute to greater themes in the film. For example, Stotaro uses a canted angle and a long shot when Willard first enters the jungle, making him seem small and unbalanced to demonstrate his powerlessness against the jungle. Additionally, Stotaro uses saturated colors to signify the culture clash between Willard's men and the native people. Stotaro plays with lighting throughout the film, particularly evident in the scenes involving Kurtz. Stotaro mires Kurtz in swatches of dark light to reflect the good and evil that resides within him, Willard, and the viewer at home.   \n\tOverall, I highly recommend Apocalypse Now because of the way the film examines universally relevant themes such as good versus evil. Willard begins the film in an existential crisis, home alone with nothing to fill the empty void inside of him, but he ends up travelling deep inside himself as he ventures farther and farther into the jungle. As Willard embarks on his journey to find Kurtz, he can't help but identify with him, noticing how the good and evil within Kurtz lives in him too, and connects him to all people. \n\tApocalypse Now is more than just a war film. The film represents the inescapable psychological journey that all humans will experience if they look deep enough. The film is uncomfortable to watch at times because it calls attention to the hearts of darkness within everyone, but essentially optimistic because of the message it sends about the power of choice to act upon these primal urges. At the end of the day, Willard decides to kill Kurtz, and so can the viewer.",

            "content": "Martin Sheen's performance and the diverse ways of interpreting the ending blew my mind making me remember this masterpiece forever. Winner of two Oscars, Apocalypse Now is known as one of the best films of the XX century and one of the best war films of all time because of the accurate representation of the horrors and situations in the war. \n\nCaptain Benjamin L.Willard (Martin Sheen) is sent to Vietnam's war to search and kill Coronel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) because he lost his mind and he is in the middle of the jungle directing an army of indigenous people who consider Kurtz a god. Through the trip, Willard will face the consequences and the horrors of the war, how people cope with them and all the injustices. \n\nApocalypse Now was directed, produced, and co-screenwritten; with John Milius, by Francis Ford Coppola based on the book Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad was a blockbuster despite all the obstacles it must face during the filming. Not only the filming was late but also over budget, because of that Coppola had to finance part of the movie by himself. Also, they decided to film it in a jungle in the Philippines which did not help but make the movie more realistic. \n\nHowever, the camerawork, lighting, and photography coordinated by Vittorio Storaro boosted the messages that the film was trying to transmit and transformed Apocalypse Now into a beautiful piece. The use of warm colors at the beginning symbolizing life, birth, and the cold colors at the end symbolizing death was the key in this movie, along with the lack of shadows and darkness during the first part, and the increasing of them as we get closer to the end, especially in Kurtz's scenes making everything more dramatic. \n\nFinally, the music used in the film creates a significant impact on the spectator because of the variety, the lyrics of the song, and the innovations. In the movie, there are songs from The Doors, Rolling Stones, and Flash Cadillac, and the incidental music composed by Carmine Coppola. For example, at the beginning we can hear a song by The Doors mixed with the sound of the helicopters during the war, introducing the public to the horrors of the war. \n\nIn conclusion, Apocalypse Now will keep being considered a masterpiece and the amazing job done by Coppola was definitely worth seeing. By watching this film, I learned about war, giving it a different point of view because of its realism, and that things can be different from what we are told. I would totally recommend it to everybody.",

            "content": "The Success of a Near Apocalyptic Failure\nThe film Apocalypse Now directed by Francis Coppola is a masterpiece that was nearly a financial disaster. The film had an originally small budget of a couple million dollars that quickly grew to a budget of over 30 million dollars. The film follows the life of a soldier in the Vietnam war on a made-up mission while still highlighting very realistic aspects of the Vietnam war. The mix of a strong story while touching of the extreme tragedies of the Vietnam war aids in drawing the viewer in and once you are drawn in you can not look away. The beginning of the film is slightly confusing, and the story of the main character is not originally clear, but over time Colonel Walter E Kurtz's back story becomes clear. He is played by the amazing Marlon Brando who does a fantastic job of portraying the mental tole being in a war has on a person. The film puts on display incredible special effects as the film is full of explosions however this stimulation does not take away from the content of the story. Often special effects are used as a crutch to draw away from weak story, but in this case the plethora of special effects augments the story being told. Creating a film about such a heavy topic while still making the film enjoyable is often hard, but Coppola did an amazing job of striking a balance between the two. By placing a fictional story in a real environment, it allowed the viewer to buy into the story with out being overly disturbed while still seeing flashes of the terrible situations that took place during the Vietnam war. This mix of real and fake makes the story so much more compelling and really leads to the viewer being invested in the characters of the film. Overall, the film is a masterpiece of cometary on war subtly entwined in an eye-catching story of a mission in the Vietnam war. The film is slightly intense at points that may drive away some viewers, but in my opinion this film is an absolute must watch.",

            "content": "I can't begin to explain how misguided WaPo reviewer Gary Arnold was in his harsh, and insulting review of this classic movie.\n\nWhile he heaped exaggerated praise on the simplistic, All-American and design-based achievement of Star Wars - a movie that literally means nothing more than what's presented onscreen, he seemed to lack the cognizant faculties necessary to realize the combination of satire, poetry, real-world drama and sheer anxiety regarding the Vietnam situation was damned near brilliant. Time hasn't been kind to the Star Wars brand, while Coppola's classic dramas continue to mesmerize and amaze with sheer production talent and great storytelling.\n\nAs the general public and armchair war historians are aware, following a brutal famine at the hands of the Japanese and the neglect of Vichy France in the mid 1940s, the cause for an independent Vietnamese people took hold - the idea had been latent for years before war broke out against French colonial forces, later the war continued brutally (and aimlessly) for a further two decades - while the American taxpayer and it's rein holders had actually NOTHING to gain from the conflict - other than bloodshed and the gradual disregard for American global power. \n\nAnd so in 1976 Coppola's troubled production begins in earnest in Southeast Asia, in this case the Philippines - the film is utterly modern looking even today, it's shocking, ironic, bloody and above all raises above the tropes of the standard \"war movie\" by asking deeper moral questions about authority, cultural relations, the human spirit and so on, in essence blending elements of realist war drama with Mr Coppola's richly visual, occasionally arthouse cinematic style and a nod to the structural outline of Joseph Conrad's classic novel Heart of Darkness about a desperate and dangerous river mission to meet Kurtz, a paternal cult figure (or imperialist) that's allegedly \"lost his mind\". \n\nAs Coppola said, the film wasn't just \"anti-war, but anti-lie\" - the central conceit, and the theme which resonates with viewers the most, is the contradiction between military authority, their claims, and the reality on the ground. Some viewers may prefer the Godfather pictures as less troubling, visually richer cinema (in Technicolour) but really all his films from this period are excellent, and worthy of attention.",

Behind the camera, director Francis Ford Coppola delivers one of the definitive anti-war films, delving into all aspects of its dangers and hypocrisy.

I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it\n\nThis leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie . I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound , editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too ) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted , and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border\n\nHow about the script ? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director , I said \" was \" in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head , but his sacrifice was worth it . In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen , but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war . Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes , so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension . When Coppola states \" This movie isn't about Vietnam - It is Vietnam \" he's right . What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970 ) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of America\n\nIt's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President ? ) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime . I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic . In fact the premise can lend itself to many other genres like a western where an army officer has to track down and kill a renegade colonel who's leading an injun war party , or a sci-fi movie where a UN assassin is to eliminate a fellow UN soldier who's leading a resistance movement on Mars , though this is probably down to Joseph Conrad's original source novel. 9.8/10",

Winner of 2 out of 8 Academy Awards in 1980, including Cinematography and Sound, very well deserved without a doubt. The whole movie is just an artistic eerie masterpiece through and through.

It is not an easy act to follow.\n\nMartin Sheen plays Captain Benjamin Willard, who follows a river from South Vietnam to Cambodia.  Willard is on a secret mission to assassinate Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlo Brando.  Kurtz is an Army Special Forces officer accused of murder and is thought to be insane.  The movie is based on the novella \"Heart of Darkness,\" which took place in 19th century Congo.  The Vietnam War wisely became the setting for this updated version of the story.\n\nAs I re-watched the movie, I remembered that this is also what introduced me to what I think is the greatest band in history – The Doors.  Before 1979, I had no idea about their music and the song \"The End\" that starts off the film is perfect.  Coppola also uses other music to great effect in \"Apocalypse Now,\" including \"The Ride of the Valkyries\" in what is the greatest war scene ever made.  \n\nThe only flaw I find in this movie is when Willard finally makes it to Kurtz's compound.  I'm just not crazy about those scenes.  Brando is, of course, an incredible actor, but they diminish the clear vision Coppola has during everything that came before that.  Every time I watch \"Apocalypse Now\" it's the ending scenes that take away from what I think is a great movie.",

I can also say the same for Robert Duvall, who really brought some charisma about his character (Kilgore).\nThe score is really different to the standard score you'll see in plenty of movies, and this score actually made itself a factor of my inner debate about whether this was really a psychological movie. The only score from another movie I could at least try and liken it to is Blade Runner (1982), mainly for the use of a similar sounding instrument, that's it! Blade Runner's score sounded more Sci Fi, this doesn't, in fact I dont really know what it sounds like..\nThe cinematography is both stunning and beautiful. There are some moments in this movie that are written into history for the best cinematography of its time, and it makes me realise that even then back when Hollywood had left the golden age, filmmakers and cinematographers still has an almost perfect vision for the look of their movies!\nFinally, my favourite part of the movie is the scene in which we join Kilgore on his helicopter assault on a Vietnamese village, while listening to \"Ride of The Valkyries\". I love all the practical effects used in this scene and it makes me appreciate this film much more for how ambitious the production was.",

And yet, I didn't come away enamored by this movie, or struck with awe.  The central story, about Ben Willard in pursuit of a rogue colonel gone insane, could've been told with a much more trimmed down run-time in my opinion; this affected the films pacing for me in parts.  The entire middle section of the film, between Ben's initial briefing and the final act where he locates Kurtz, teeters between being absorbing and beautiful, to downright boring and uninteresting.

I wanted to walk in to this classic knowing as little as possible, and watched the longest version first, which turned out to be a critical error. Redux is more faithful to the roots of the narrative (Heart of Darkness) in a literal sense, but the original cut is more effective at conveying its message, providing a more streamlined exploration of the themes of madness in \"acceptable\" circumstances and outside of it, without being bogged down by unnecessary circumstantial context. Playing out like Aguirre in Vietnam, Apocalypse Now may be considered too esoteric to be the definitive Vietnam film by some, but I disagree; its exploration of morality and duty is integral to the rationale behind the war. The audience is granted the opportunity to fall down the rabbit hole with Sheen, as the necessities of his circumstances (and his actions) evolve as his boat travels upriver. Deserving of its high status, from my point of view. (5/5)",

It juxtaposes traditional battle scenes with criticisms on the morality of killing for politics, and imposing American culture on others because it is the \"best in the world.\" Of course, the others see it as a Horror, where God and faith are replaced by barbecued steaks and beer, wine, whiskey and pot. The story is like a descent with Alice into Wonderland, or with Virgil into Hell, the characters are larger than life and the hunted, who is hunted because he has gone insane, seems the sanest and most cogent of all. Fight to win or don't fight at all. But since the 1940's we have been involved in an eternal morally dubious conflict that we fight, not to win, but to bandaid everyone we hurt.  This film is as relevant or even more relevant today than when it was made.  We still engage in corrosive conduct, worldwide.  It seems like the \"clowns\" running things have become more clownish, no one will take responsibility, because we have not/will not and can not learn from our mistakes.  I always feel moved by this film, it is a wonder, much like 2001. I cannot imagine any other actors in the roles, which seem perfect for them.

Even the title of the film seems to be a funny message. Apocalypse Now. Perhaps a jab at \"Nirvana Now.\" ? Making fun of hippies? This film is one of those that you'd enjoy watching an hour long in-depth analysis. However I'm not here to do that. I'm just here to tell you that if you haven't seen this film, you're missing out... on so much. \n\n It's a long film, but in my opinion not a single minute is wasted. Very rarely when a film is this long, do I want it to keep going. An astonishing piece of art. Probably my favourite mainstream Vietnam war picture. \nBig thumbs up! \n\n\"Charlie Dont Surf!\"\n\n\n\"We train young men to drop fire on people, but their commanders won't allow them to write \"f***\" on their airplanes because it's obscene!\" - Col.

From the opening shot, this film manages to keep up a haunting, hallucinatory tone, unflinchingly. Many critics use the word 'haunting' very loosely, but this movie is truly that. The first time I watched this movie, I remember thinking it was incredibly boring, but about 3 months later, I had the uncontrollable urge to watch it again. I did, and it became clear to me why this movie is so great. Very few movies have been able to embed themselves into my memory. Most often, I forget what movie I watched less than an hour ago. This movie has stayed with me since I watched it when I was 14. THIS is film-making at it's greatest.",

And not for the amount of work that went just in production and post production- the editing factor is still the most changingly controversial aspect of the film, there have been three versions where actually none of them matches the huge length of the original shot. Leaving all those post success debates behind, the film in its entirety is a battle for sure; mind you, I am taking all the versions into account and also no matter what I say, some of this or all of this has already been said about this classic over the years and even generations.\n\nThe film communicates the threat of the battle by challenging its audience first and foremost. And you'd think that it is not fair, since the film is the one with the voice and the stage. Francis even describes this unfair advantage in the narration by changing the perspective of the viewers about war. And the horror strikes you then, when you realize how easy the war was.\n\nHow Francis has crafted the most sinister deeds easily accessible. The chilling sound effects of the helicopter is your secondary concern, the primary is its ability to mask itself as God and snatch the basic rights of a civilization. Another thing to note here is how the terror of war is not only expressed as a form of an attack but a defence mechanism too. The most natural instinct is burned to an infernal excuse to breathe. Easily, the film is not for everyone. It makes you think how completely different certificate should be allowed to such classics.",

            "content": "This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I don't think it's perfect, it definitely has it's flaws, but what's great about the film is brilliant. Single moments and images from this film stay in your mind long after watching it for the first time and it explores the mental impact that war has on soldiers with verve. Coppola is legend for a reason and his abilities are on full display here as he takes an unruly story and a difficult event to portray and makes an intense, watchable film that engages it's viewers completely. I have never experienced war, nor has anybody in my family but this film made the horrors of the Vietnam War clear and showed how war completely dehumanizes people as it is unfair to expect them to simply go back to their normal lives after putting them through hell. This film is as affecting today as it was 40 years ago and is better than almost any film ever released.\n\nCaptain Benjamin L. Willard, Martin Sheen, is a Vietnam War veteran obsessed with taking on another mission in order to escape the struggles of living in the real world where he and his wife have broken up. He is deployed by his superiors to murder Walter E. Kurtz, Marlon Brando, a former military man who has become radicalized and set up a cult on an outpost in Cambodia. Willard must command a river patrol boat and travel down the Viet-Cong coast along with a supporting cast of colorful characters including \"Chef\" Hicks, Frederic Forrest, and \"Mr. Clean\" Miller, Laurence Fishburne. Along the way he experiences the full horror of war and begins to fall under the spell of Kurtz as he faces terror and pain.\n\nThe directorial vision that this film has is clear, we see a man quickly descend into hell, this is one of the better examples of auteur vision that I have seen. It is clear that immense attention to detail has been used as little touches like Coppola's cameo as a photojournalist and an out of nowhere scene of one of his peers waterskiing. The balancing of tones is superb as dark humor, serious drama and psychological thrillers are separated well and sometimes combined to horrify the audience. The look of the film is inspired by the similarly auteur driven Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972) but here the final section of the film is something all it's own and the river cruise sequences are more crisp in their execution than in the German classic. His intentions are largely fulfilled by the outcome, the film itself, as he creates a film that, in my opinion, realistically and beautifully portrays the horror.\n\nThe performance of Marlon Brando is also deserving of note as although I understand his work ethic on set was terrible and he needed Coppola to speak to him through earpiece to remember his lines. He is completely intimidating and oddly charismatic as Kurtz and despite the fact that you never forget that it's Marlon Brando playing the role his own public persona plays into the role. The iconography of him as a giant mass of a man who slurs his words constantly is scarier and more compelling than any other actor going method for the role. He deserves the praise he gets for the performance as he make the third part of the film watchable.\n\nThe writing deserves to be equally praised as the script, a collaboration between Coppola and John Milius, is lyrical and poetic without feeling detached like the West Side Story (1961) screenplay. Sheen's various monologues are deservedly iconic and Duvall gets his share of iconic lines like \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning.\" The use of voiceover is excellent, very difficult to pull off, and although the story does get messy it never loses your interest.\n\nThis, to me, is a better film than The Godfather (1972) because it completely pulls you in and everything about it is horrifying and yet it grabs you completely. Managing to convey an event that is uncomfortable to talk about and generally unpleasant while making it exciting is an achievement that deserves recognition.",

You get a clear sense of Sheen's descent into madness as he chases the mad Brando.  The action scenes were remarkable considering they're 40 years old.  From the aerial shots of the helicopters in formation, to the explosions, to the use of fire and flares... it's all so captivating and feels so genuine/real.  The plot was have been simple (a man's quest up river from South Vietnam to Cambodia in order to hunt down a rogue Captain) but it's also so much more than that.  Francis Ford Coppola stated that he wanted it akin to a man's journey inward; to his true self, and how that requires you to go slightly mad in order to achieve the objective.  The single only reason it didn't get 5* is because I found the ending to be just \"good\" and anti-climatic.  FFC admits he didn't know how to end the saga and was disappointed in the final result.  The climax imo ended up being the journey up the coast and the battles they ran into.

            "content": "\"Apocalypse Now\", released in 1979, follows the story of Captain Willard who is sent on a mission to Cambodia to kill a colonel who has gone AWOL. The film made me feel enthralled because there was so much going on. I felt like I couldn't look away for a second without missing something. It made me think how hard and strenuous it was being a part of the Vietnam War, and the chaos and disorder. I would say that this film qualifies as more of an action film. While there isn't action in every other scene, the action that is there is certainly intense and crazy. Written by Francis Ford Coppola and John Milius, the story of the film was incredible. I particularly enjoyed the scene on the boat where the guys are listening to an announcement on the radio signaling the correct way to hang clothes to dry, as the mayor of Saigon wants to keep the city looking beautiful. The irony of that statement considering the city was in the midst of the war made me chuckle. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, I thought that the film was incredibly well-done especially considering it was such a huge feat. One series of shots that I enjoyed was when Martin Sheen's character is narrating his mission and looking through his packet on Kurtz, the shots go from an extreme close-up of his eyes to his files that he's looking through. Edited by Lisa Fruchtman, Gerald B. Greenberg, and Walter Murch, I found the pacing of the film to be a little slow at times. One series that I did enjoy where the pacing picked up more was when the guys decide to bomb the town that will give them the vantage point into Cambodia. The way that that scene was edited as the helicopters are making their way into the town and you see the villagers realize what's going on and scatter really added to the tension. Led by Martin Sheen, the cast of the film is truly the best of the best. One of my favorite scenes was when Robert Duvall's character was standing around waiting for an opportunity to go surfing. Despite a serious situation, he exudes a lightheartedness that is fun to watch. With the cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, I particularly enjoyed this shot where the boat drives away and there's all of these great shadows on the water and the sky is this golden yellow. It offers a little magic and beauty in an otherwise intense film. Personally, I struggled with the sound design a little. In the scene where they had just bombed the village, and the guys were wanting to go surfing it was difficult to hear the conversations. The film was certainly professional work, and I felt that the production value overall was great. I would say that I would like for them to make the movie shorter, but I did also choose to watch the director's cut.",

            "content": "The most gritty and realistic war film ever.\n\nI suggest watching Apocalypse Now as the theatrical version, which contains all the essential story elements with great pacing, instead of the bloated and overly long Redux version that has been released. Apocalypse Now is eternally haunting. I find it the most gruesome and thoughtful movie about the effects of extended warfare ever captured on film.\n\nApocalypse Now is a must watch war film for any number of reasons. Francis Ford Coppola went through such a nightmare to film it, it would be a shame not to watch it at all. His trouble were well worth the effort. Every shot is gorgeous or disturbing. Beautiful Vietnam scenery offset by bloody violence and garish atrocity. Coppola has mastered the art of displaying frighteningly real elements alongside various character studies. The real Napalm strike, helicopter air ride, boat journey, to the disquieting ending are all worth the price of admission.\n\nEerie, atmospheric sounds and creepy score throbbing throughout the film, make Apocalypse Now a timeless piece on how to build a tone. From the occasional narration from Martin Sheen's character to the constant mention of Kurtz' accomplishments, Apocalypse Now is a crescendo of madness. The screams of soldiers and civilians alike echo throughout the ears of audiences  forever. Every scene depicts more horrors for your eyes to feast on. I guarantee this movie will upset and disturb you at times. It is like no other war movie. No glorification of American military pride and patriotism, but rather a full display of the monstrosity of man.\n\nI must mention that Apocalypse Now is easily Martin Sheen's greatest performance. We see Sheen portray an American Captain Willard, who starts out impatient for a mission, then leads down to a fall of morality. We follow alongside his decision making and moral questioning throughout Vietnam. He is phenomenal when acting with his eyes and looks alone.\n\nFurthermore, Apocalypse Now features a brief, but brilliant later era role from Marlon Brando. Brando is anything but dull as he eats up the scenery with thoughtful moral justification for his atrocities. Brando plays Col. Kurtz with a zealous fervor apt for his character's insanity. His portrayal of a realistic cult leader in the midst of the Vietnam War is chilling as are his character Kurtz' last words. I will not spoil anything in the movie, so I just recommend you watch it for the chance to see Brando use every second of screen time to perfect, inspired acting.\n\nIn all, Francis Ford Coppola filmed an epic war drama and another masterpiece of cinema in his already hallowed filmography. Apocalypse Now will try to break your spirit and mind, but that is the journey Coppola asks you to embark upon with him. You will feel like you are in the middle of Vietnam at all times. It is a frightening prospect even in revisiting Apocalypse Now.",

That's exactly what made the ending falls flat, at least for me. Instead of being one of the greatest endings ever, I found it kinda cheesy!\n\n(8/10)",

The film seems realistic enough in parts, veterans of the war will say some of the battles are much like how they were (and that the USO show was spot on). Heart of Darkness combined with Dispatches seems about right. As it turns out, there's a retired Australian officer Barry Petersen who was just about a real-life Colonel Kurtz. Having had experience in Malaysia with the mountain tribes, the CIA took him on to lead the Montagnards against the Vietcong, similar to Kurtz. \"By 1965, (Petersen) had fostered, according to his CIA bosses, a 'personality cult'.\" However when the CIA asked Petersen to step down, he did, avoiding the fate of Kurtz. \nI've also watched Redux, the original is much better in my opinion!",

            "content": "Perhaps the ultimate movie about the madness of war and the Vietnam War in particular, Apocalypse Now still makes for disturbing and at times darkly comedic viewing. There are so many iconic sequences in this movie. I suppose everyone thinks of the lunatic, surfing obsessed, Colonel Kilgore and his \"Ride of the Valkyries\" accompanying bombing raid but that's just one of a plethora gobsmacking moments. The movie is famously based on the Conrad novel Heart of Darkness that was set in the steaming jungles of the Belgian Congo and concerns the search for a rogue ivory trader. The basic plot fits so well with the latter days of the US-Vietnam conflict with a young, disillusioned army officer despatched to track down a mad Colonel who has been waging his own war on the Cambodian boarders. Much of the action takes place on a small US Navy boat heading up-stream and has a claustrophobic, hallucinatory feel to it. The journey is punctuated by landings at various stations along the way, each more unreal than the last as civilisation is left further and further behind. All the time, the spectre of the dangerous warlord, Colonel Kurtz, hangs over the crew like some dark shadow. Martin Sheen leads in the role of the war-weary Captain Willard and it is a role he will forever be remembered for. Colonel Kilgore is Robert Duval, a scarily young-looking Laurence Fishburne has a significant part as Clean and Dennis Hopper plays a photographer who has taken too much acid and come under the thrall of Kurtz. There are also bit parts for Scott Glenn and Harrison Ford. However, the most famous piece of casting is that of Kurtz himself. The role is played by Marlon Brando and, though he appears for a relatively short amount of time, often hidden in the shadows, so dominant is the presence of the character and so carefully is his appearance built-up, that you can't help but be mesmerised by him. This movie still has many scenes that are difficult to watch but for me it is Francis Ford Coppola's finest movie and hasn't dated one bit.",

Apocalypse Now is definitely one of those films and, while I can see why people love it, I didn't adore it as much as they do. I can clearly see that there was a lot of high-quality craft that went into the making of this film. It has some superb acting performances, the visuals are astounding, and the entire third act is remarkable. There are moments in the first two acts that I was impressed with (particularly the part with Robert Duvall, who blew me away.) But there is a lot of slow build in Apocalypse Now. It's tough when you start a movie with \"Go find this guy and kill him\" and then you don't actually meet the target face-to-face until more than three-quarters of the film has passed. I think this is by design because we're supposed to be impacted by the devastating futility of the war so that we can understand why Brando is behaving like a mad man, but it makes the pace appear overly sluggish. When they finally reach the end of the river and the climactic scenes start it is 100% enthralling. So many of the images were breathtaking and iconic, plus the conversations between Brando and Sheen are awesome. If they had been able to maintain that level of intensity throughout the film then it would grip me more thoroughly. Unfortunately, because of some of the pacing issues and the long runtime Apocalypse Now is a film that I respect more than I enjoy.",

Having just enjoyed Band of Brothers´s conventional warfare during the WWII, Apocalypse Now gave me an entirely new experience by visiting the insane jungle and guerrilla warfare in Vietnam. Despite the obviously choreographed chaos for spectacular effects visually, sound wise, the horrors of war in Vietnam is many times darker and more gruesome. While WW2 was still still a time of segregation and the army was white, we see many  black soldiers in the Vietnam war reminding us that time has moved forward. While soldiers fought with more purpose in WW2, the GIs during the Vietnam war fought aimlessly against chaos, madness, darkness and without redemption. Unlike WW2, the so called enemy ´gooks´did not wear recognisable uniforms and therefore cannot be differentiated from civilians. Consequently, indiscriminate killing of civilians resulted in extreme human tragedy and turning the US soldiers into unforgivable demons.  The question of ´why why why were the US soldiers in Vietnam  fighting who we would not consider any enemy today´. The movie was a great display of American brazen stupidity and arrogant display of their gross atrocity against the indigenous natives who they massacred indiscriminately.  Anchoring this awesome film was the giant Marlon Brando. His greater than life persona commanded undivided attention in the last 30 minutes of the movie. I have no idea why Martin would Kill Marlon even after acquainting himself with a man who lost faith in the US army for all the atrocities he had witnessed and experienced.

Firstly, unflinchingly portray the brutalities of war and secondly demonstrate the unshakeable bond that soldiers share with each other.  Apocalypse Now ticks both of these boxes.  Despite how Robert Duvall has only fifteen minutes of screentime, he is brilliant as a psychotic American colonel.  He is by far one of the best parts of the film.  Perhaps even better than Marlon Brando.  I was very disappointed with Brando's contribution.  He had little to no presence and was largely forgettable in his role as the film's antagonist.  Also at two and a half hours, the film's pace does drag a little and it gets boring at times.\n\nRead my full review here: http://goo.gl/pw044Z",

Apocalypse Now captures the madness and terror of war and the darker elements of our existence, perhaps most perfectly in any scene not directly dealing with combat. The simple hunt for a surfing spot or the bizarre USO show scenes are more rattling than the movie's visceral gory moments. A viewer is inescapably left with a deep sense of unease and confusion throughout this film.\n\nThe excellent Marlon Brando delivers a captivating and, evidently, mostly unscripted performance. He steals the final third of the movie. At every moment there is an engrossing sense of confusion, angst and simmering anger, all the essential ingredients of insanity.  Col Kurtz crossed a line somewhere in his journey through combat from which he cannot return. War provides the canvass and catalyst for Col Kurtz to see the remarkable humbling reality of how precariously close we all sit to falling into the \"horror\".\n\nSeldom is a film so brilliant it cannot really be adequately summarized in words, Apocalypse Now is such a film. When you walk away after your first viewing, you cannot help but feel that you witnessed  a crowning artistic achievement. Perhaps the subject matter of madness in war is what keeps this film so illusory and mystifying, yet, make no mistake, it is truly excellent.",

            "content": "cinegeek.de Francis Ford Coppolas Apocalypse Now wurde beeinflusst von Joseph Conrads Roman Heart Of Darkness über einen Europäer namens Kurtz, der den schnellsten Weg zum Kongo anpeilt und sich dabei als eine Art Gott etabliert. Man schickt ein Boot, ihn zu suchen, wobei aber der Erzähler sein Vertrauen in die Zivilisation verliert. Er wird niedergerungen von der der Macht des Dschungels, in dem ein erbarmungsloser Darwinismus herrscht: Jedes Lebewesen versucht tagtäglich, nicht besiegt, nicht gefressen zu werden. Am Ende geht es weniger darum, Kurtz gefunden zu haben, sondern das Wissen zu teilen, dessen Kurtz gewahr wurde. Unser tägliches Leben wird als fragiles Gebilde enttarnt, das von der unbarmherzigen Gewalt der Wildnis einfach verschlungen wird. Wie sieht ein glückliches Leben aber aus? Am besten bleibt man von Kurtz Erfahrungen verschont! Letztes Jahr besuchte ich Beijing und sah Bettler auf einer Brücke, die unter Lepra litten. Abends wurden sie von der Polizei in die Wüste Gobi geschafft, um die Passanten nicht zu stören. Morgens brachten sie Schlepper zurück auf die Brücke. Ich möchte das Leben dieser Menschen nicht mit einem Film vergleichen. Dennoch wurde ich bei diesem Anblick an das erinnert, was Kurtz (Marlon Brando) Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) über den \"Horror\" erzählt. Kurtz war zuvor ein dekorierter Held der Armee im Vietnam Krieg. Er berichtet von einem Einsatz, da seine Männer die Bevölkerung eines Dorfes gegen Kinderlähmung impfen sollten. Nach der Aktion läuft ein alter Mann hinter ihnen her und brüllt, er könnte nichts mehr sehen. Sie gehen zurück und sehen, dass man allen Kindern die Arme mit der Injektion abgehackt hat. Die Arme liegen alle auf einem Haufen, ein Haufen voller kleiner Arme. Kurtz bewundert die Vietkong. Zuerst glaubte er, sie hätten einfach den stärkeren Willen, diesen Krieg zu gewinnen. Dann aber merkte er, dass sie einfach stärker waren: \"You have to have men who are moral and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling, without passion, without judgment.\" Das ist Kurtz Horror. Während der ganzen Reise geht es darum, zu begreifen, wie Kurtz sich diesen Krieg so tief vor Augen führte, dass er schliesslich nicht mehr hinsehen konnte ohne Ekel und Wahnsinn. Das Finale von Apocalypse Now verfolgt mich immer noch. Es stellt eine poetische Beschwörung dar von dem, was Kurtz herausfand - und was man selbst eigentlich nicht entdecken wollte! Während der Reise auf dem Fluss werden gewaltige Vorerwartungen an Kurtz geweckt, die Brando alle erfüllt! Es ist kaum vorstellbar, dass man 1979 Brandos Besetzung und seine unglaubliche Gage kritisierte, denn im Grunde funktioniert Apocalypse Now nur dank seiner Stimme. Brandos Stimme - das ist der Tonfall von Apocalypse Now! Ein anderes entscheidendes Element ist der Fotojournalist (Dennis Hopper), der Kurtz' Camp findet und dort als eine Art Zeuge bleibt - stoned. Willard gegenüber faselt er, dass Kurtz so etwas wie ein poetischer Krieger sei. Der Fotograph ist so etwas wie der Hofnarr, das Bindeglied zwischen Kurtz und Willard. Heute, über 30 Jahre nach der Premiere von Apocalypse Now, strahlt dieses Meisterwerk viel klarer als die meisten \"grössten Filme aller Zeiten\". Während den meisten von ihnen vielleicht eine herausragende Sequenz gelingt, folgt in Apocalypse Now eine auf die andere. Die Beste ist die Hubschrauber Attacke von Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) zum Walkürenritt von Richard Wagner, wie sie auf einen Platz voller Kinder herab schiessen. Duvall bleibt vor allem wegen des Satzes \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning.\" in Erinnerung. Es ist angsteinflössend wie leer sein Col. Kilgore innerlich ist: Der Surf Fanatiker ist bereit, eine Bucht einzunehmen, nur um seinen Männern einen Surf Spass zu bereiten. In einer anderen Szene sehen wir eine vietnamesische Familie auf einem Boot. Das Mädchen macht eine plötzliche Bewegung und ein junger Mann am Maschinen-Gewehr (Laurence Fishburne, noch fast ein Teenager!) eröffnet das Feuer. Die ganze Familie wird getötet, kurz darauf finden sie heraus, dass dieses Mädchen nur seine Puppe holen wollte. Der Rock'n Roll und 60s Soundtrack eröffnet und beschliesst den Film mit The Doors. Die Musik unterstreicht einige surrealistische Momente, macht aber auch deutlich, dass die Soldaten die Musik von Zuhause brauchen, um ihre Einsamkeit zu vergessen. Mit Drogen und Suff versuchen sie, so etwas wie Heimatgefühle zu erzeugen. Von allen Vietnam Filmen ist Apocalypse Now der Grösste! Es ist nicht einfach nur ein Kriegsfilm, sondern er dringt vor, in die dunkelsten Ecken der Seele. Der Film offenbart einige Wahrheiten, die durch den Krieg offen gelegt werden. Wahrheiten, die niemand von uns erfahren will! Ich muss wieder an Beijing denken und wie es mich an Kurtz erinnerte. Bleiben wir nicht doch am liebsten dumm, um genau so etwas nie zu sehen? Es ist schlicht unmöglich, Apocalypse Now in so wenigen Sätzen zu beschreiben. Ich möchte euch deshalb noch die Doku \"Hearts Of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse,\" aus dem Jahr 1991 von Fax Bahr und George Hickenlooper nahe legen. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8_RkJC1XwY&list=PL1gEYf-UTvlEyfY7dRNkree7G7Yyz_KOm (Dazu haben wir euch eine Film List mit tollen epischen Filmen zusammengestellt auf unserer Empfehlungsseite cinegeek.de",

            "content": "Apocalypse Now is my favourite film of all time. It is on most top 100 movie lists. It is certainly a work of art and long labour of Francis Ford Coppola (see Hearts of Darkness, the documentary about the making of this film).\n\nThe film is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's book, Heart of Darkness, placed in the context of the Vietnam War, rather than in Africa. Martin Sheen is brilliant as the protagonist. Marlon Brando is in his natural element as an actor, largely improvising his role as Colonel Kurtz.\n\nThe Redux version adds some unnecessary footage, that is not essential for first time viewers, but appreciated by Apocalypse Now aficionados such as myself.\n\nAt 3 hours, this film is an epic, yet has little dialogue. It is mostly narrated by Captain Willard, the leader of an expedition to terminate Kurtz. It has a strong parallel to Dante's Inferno, as the travelers pass through the different stages of Hell (i.e. war is hell). The travelling up river theme has also borrowed heavily from Herzog's Aguirre, Wrath of God. Performances by Dennis Hopper, Robert Duvall and Harrison Ford round out the cast.\n\nThis is not a casual film. This is a work of art to be savoured and studied. The sound and visuals are equally as important as the dialogue and acting. The film is in a class by itself and sparked a revisiting of Vietnam films after it. It is a must see for anyone who appreciates cinema. This is the art in its highest form.",

Nor is it really a movie about the war in general.  But about following a specific hand picked small group of guys to travel by boat down a river in search of a renegade former military Colonel who has gone AWOL.  The only rumors the government and military know is he has set himself up in the jungle and has made himself a God to the people that inhabit the jungle.  This movie is not only interesting and unique by stylistically beautiful.  What we come to discover when Marlon Brando finally does make his long awaited appearance is madness, some of the best scenes of the entire movie take place in a small cave between Brando and a young Martin Sheen.  Great movie.  My favorite war movie.  What also makes this movie interesting is the story about the making of the actual film.  It took years to make and almost never got made if it wasn't for Coppola practically bankrupting himself to keep the picture alive. because he was so passionate about it.

            "content": "Masterful, precise and trippy, Apocalypse Now is one movie that only after it's over do you fully appreciate the astounding work on show. With Francis Ford Coppola in the directors chair and a cast that just seem to all mould together beautifully, there is no doubt in my mind that this movie is just purely a masterpiece. The film see's Captain Benjamin, L. Willard (Martin Sheen) who is tasked with finding out the whereabouts of a US army Colonel who has gone rogue and is apparently leading a small devout army of locals. Marlon Brando is Colonel Kurtz the man who Willard is after, but before we ever get even near Kurtz, first we go through a series of insanely bright and colourful battles, live shows, a tiger and some fantastically chosen music to accompany you as well.\n\nThe majority of the movie is spent on the deck of a Navy Patrol Boat led by a man only known as \"Chief\", the crew are a good mix of personalities, some miss home, some want to just get the trip over with and some just want to kill some Viet Cong. Throughout the trip down the vast networks of rivers in Vietnam, we encounter brutality and truly come to see war from two perspectives, some say this is Pro-war, and some the opposite and that for me is what makes this so perfect, it never condones or condemns, it just shows normal people in a war. The true human cost is on full show, all the way through I didn't want people to die, I know in some action movies death can seem basic and just common place, but here we see a world where you don't feel anyone really deserves for their life to be ended in such ways.\n\nCoppola draws inspirations and my word do they work for him, he works this movie like a true war film should be, raw but intelligent, thunderous but ultimately horrific in equal measure. As the story goes along you just get to delve into his mind even more and what he was trying to do with each scene, for me the thing that stands out most from him directing is the rich light and textures that show not only the beautiful locations picked, but also the trippy way in which he makes you feel. Seriously after finishing this it gave me a headache but it wasn't so much because the lights hurt you're eyes no, it was the ending which really only after makes you feel kind of weird.\n\n As for the cast in this we have of course as mentioned Marlon Brando and Martin Sheen, both doing undeniably great jobs in their roles respectively. Other cast members include Robert Duvall as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore whose reference to napalm is one the best and most remembered in cinema history. A young Laurence Fishburne appears on Willard's boat as the young solider from the Bronx Tyrone, whose cocky approach to the way in which war works makes Sheen's observations of the things around him even more compelling.\n\nIf I could recommend one film about War, then this is one I could not leave behind because it's just so damn flawless, this kind of movie is a rare thing. I think all concluding praise really has to go to Coppola for his work and tireless dedication to it, plagued by troubles throughout filming and Sheen suffering a heart attack this is one film where hard work truly applies. So all in all an unflinching look into the minds of a soldier, the darkness of fighting a battle and the way in which beautiful lands can be ravaged by war.",

Apocalypse Now does not fall into the trap of feeling like it needs to recreate some real life account that's only based on word of mouth anyway.  Instead it captures the attitude of the Vietnam War while steering clear of too much political diatribe and focusing on the challenging conflict Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) faces: what do I do when my orders are to kill one of my own?  It uses the Vietnam War as a chaotic backdrop taking its toll on the Captain, who tosses between justifying his mission and sympathizing with his target, Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), but it could've used any war to tell its story.  Some of its most horrific scenes are both eye-opening and entertaining with dark humor at times looming over everything, particularly as it relates to napalm-loving, Wagner-fetishizing Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall).  Unlike many war movies, which fall into the trap of expecting audiences to feel something no matter what just because the subject is war ( even with no central point to the story), Apocalypse Now has a core, a thing we're getting to that is covered in layers and slowly peeling away frame after frame.  There is constant intrigue, something to always keep us thinking and imagining.  Coppola never loses us, and it's a testament to this being his other finest work beside Godfather II.",

So it doesn't seem like something that would make good material for a film, especially so soon after the war's conclusion.  Enter \"Apocalypse Now\".  Though many films have tried and will try in the future, \"Apocalypse Now\" is, by far, the best film to capture the \"horror\" of the Vietnam War.  Here are some of the things that make it so great.\n\nFor starters, the cinematography is superb.  There are some beautiful shots of the Vietnam landscape.  \"Apocalypse Now\" is also a very well-written film, telling a complete, interesting story that paints an accurate picture of the Vietnam War.  Finally, I really enjoyed Martin Sheen's lead performance.\n\n\"Apocalypse Now\" is not without its problems, however.  The film has some major pacing issues.  It starts out slow and pondering, yet when it finally introduces Marlon Brando's character, it is too late in the film, leaving little time to develop his character or explain his descent into madness.  I'm sure these were intentional decisions to add emotional depth, but I personally feel that it is to the film's detriment.\n\n\"Apocalypse Now\" is undoubtedly a classic film, and one that everyone should see when they are of age.  It is an excellent examination of why war is such a horrible thing, yet why it is a necessary evil.  However, I don't agree with the claims that this is one of the greatest films of all time.",

The cinematography is breathtaking, the acting is impeccable, the dialogue is compelling, and the story is amongst some of the most gripping and emotionally powerful narratives I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.\nBased on Joseph Conrad's book, Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now is about an army captain named Willard (Martin Sheen) who is assigned to locate and \"terminate the command\" of an AWOL Colonel (Marlon Brando) named Kurtz. The maddened Kurtz was rumoured to have set himself up as a godlike figure deep in the Cambodian jungle acting as a maverick and a frighteningly unstable charismatic.. \nWillard, with a handful of soldiers, commands a privately owned boat down the river to find the missing Kurtz. The horrific experiences he and his men are exposed to are affective in their nightmarish quality.\nApocalypse Now is an excellent Vietnam War film that can express the stark horrors of war without relying on preachy gimmicks or painfully obvious anti-war sentimentality. It shows a disturbing, bloody sequence of events that speak for themselves without any commentary or messages. It is affective and poignant and is a must-see.",

I'm really close to giving it four stars, but I wasn't extremely emotionally invested/constantly thinking about how much I loved it like I do with most four-star movies. Still, this was so great.\n\nMost of my enjoyment probably came from the visual aspects. The cinematography and effects were astounding; it didn't feel like I was watching a 1979 movie. The direction is obviously amazing. There were so many camera angles and camera movements and visual flairs that I just loved, and I would've loved them even if the writing wasn't as good as it is.\n\nIf I have one complaint, it's a personal one: I'm not a big fan of the extremely stoic characters with only the one serious expression, so I wasn't head over heels for Martin Sheen's Willard. Still, his grave seriousness suited the role, and besides, there were plenty of characters that made up for it in spades. Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, and Sam Bottoms all played very compelling characters.\n\nThere are so many individual standout scenes. The scene with \"Ride of the Valkyries\" playing as the assault on the Vietnamese village occurred was both thrilling and horrifying. There were moments of enormous tension, especially in the scenes where Willard basically traipses into Kurtz's domain, completely at his mercy. And there were poignant, sad moments, as when the random Vietnamese family is killed in a panic, and when the voiceover of Mr. Clean's mother's hopeful letter plays over his death. One of my other favorite scenes is when Willard and Lance are at the bridge, asking the soldiers who their commanding officer is - there's a magnificent tension and beauty given to the whole scene with the simple effect of the slowly flashing light.",

All's well that ends well, and it ends very well indeed. Because Apocalypse Now is lauded as one of the greatest films ever; a hallucinogenic, audacious sensory maelstrom that's both filmed on a massive scale, and hyper-concentrated on its characters. At the height of the Vietnam War, drunk, restless Captain Willard is sent on a mission to terminate a Colonel who has gone completely insane and set up a murderous cult in Cambodia. Coppola takes his time building up the characters, turning the screws unbearably tightly, and slowly descending us into a pit of moral decay to the point where the reveal of Marlon Brando is almost anticlimactic. Few films before or since have been so technically and stylistically daring. We will never see its like again.",

From any other versions I've seen, this is definitely the best adaptation of the novel\"Heart of Darkness\". Personally, this is one of the best war drama film, the best Vietnam war film, the best Coppola film, and my number 1 film of all time IMO. I can't think of any other. It's like, the Mona Lisa of all films. It's a beautifully filmed movie with the most beautiful landscapes in the depth of the Philippine jungle. The slow paced camera shots are absolutely stunning. The first parts of this film is epic, the last parts are more epic. When I heard that helicopter sound in the background as that track \"The End by The Doors\" started to play, while Martin Sheen is dancing to it. I thought, wow, this film started very gracefully. Martin Sheen made a performance like no other. If you have seen that documentary film (Heart of Darkness), that tells about the making of this movie. It tells how Sheen struggles and was hospitalized for days while filming it. The camera shots in this film are absolutely fantastic, gorgeously well made shots. From the helicopter takes from above, to the river shots until they reach out Col. Kurtz's base in Cambodia. I thought it was absolutely beautiful. It was almost a very artsy film in terms of cinematography. I do love the performances especially for Sheen. This is his best performance yet. As for Brando, I thought he did quietly good in this film. I like how he utter those poetic words while dictating it. Duvall has a small part in this film, \" I love the smell of napalm in the morning.\" he said. He is this strict but funny lieutenant like he is almost a real army by portraying his character. And when Dennis Hopper showed up, it brings up smiles to my face. I like his character. feels like he's always stoned or something. He is so funny by doing that. Great screenwriting, Coppola and John Milius did a very great job on the script. I love the dialogue on this film. Speaking of Redux, people have problems on it. I say it doesn't affect the movie at all. I thought it is still a part of the art. The whole French army thing and more nude scenes from the playboy bunnies. I thought it was okay, I don't mind it really. It doesn't matter as how this beautiful movie continues to play. In the end, what comes to my mind is it was dark, beautiful and fantastic. A brilliant film in the making. Credit also to Vittorio Storaro as the cinematographer on this film. And of course to the one and only Francis Ford Coppola. 5/5",

The movie, nonetheless, was overweight and layered with excess. If they had just shrunk it down, cut it closer to the bone it would've kept it from dragging a magnificently large fraction of the movie, thus alleviating the pain of sore-ass boredome, and, all in all, making it a much better movie in my opinion. It was, in fact, a chore to watch, and made this job seem actually work-based. However, it did do what it set out to do. It revealed to us \"the horror, the horror\", the unmerciful, hell-on-earth horrors behind war and the long-term effects it has on people. It features the turmoiled struggle of mankind in battle and the darkened hearts it creates. It has stood the test of time, despite my take on it, and, ever still, remains a critically and userly-acclaimed film in the world today. I must alert you though.

Part horror, part drama, part psychological thriller, part art house, part action and part epic, the film is a shockingly well executed, despite the gauntlet ran by everyone who produced it. Unlike the comparably tame and individually focused art house film industry of today, Apocalypse Now is a raw piece of widely impacting work, pulling no punches philosophically as it offers a deeply artistic and cinematically impressive view of the conflict in Vietnam, utilizing an effective mixed genre soundtrack, gritty lighting and all-in performances from a legendary cast. The result is an enrapturing journey that neither condemns or condones the activities in Vietnam, choosing instead to present the horrors, the sorrow, the violence and the good in an intimate, closely shot and extremely realistic package that allows the viewer to make their own decisions and more importantly, offers an accessible way for the American public to begin to move past the disaster that was Vietnam. The audience isn't just shown Vietnam, nor are they told what happened there. Instead, Coppola creates a world for the audience to immerse themselves in, even as they reel in disgust at the realization that the world is their own. The incredible aspect of the film, which defines its greatness, is the rare timelessness it carries, successfully blending the older, traditional epic styles of the previous decades with the choppy post-modern film style that has grown increasingly popular and diluted in recent years. Sheen, Brando and the rest of the cast shine together, offering the epic lines and stirring shots of the older generation while simultaneously offering emotion packed close-ups and shadowed symbolism. Overall, Apocalypse Now is a culturally encompassing and timeless work, relevant to generations of the past, present and future as tale of woe and the horrors that descend upon us when we result to war. The most shocking thing about this movie is that it didn't win Best Picture, losing out to the relatively trivial Kramer vs. Kramer, a testament to the shortsighted nature of the Academy.",

From what I have understood, Coppola's films are mostly overblown shit. Films like Godfather 1 and 2 did lag at a lot, but Apocalypse now was a bit too long for no reason. It could have easily been at least an hour short owing to the fact that it has so little of a story to tell. Modern war films are not good as the war films of the older times and amongst these films, only Saving Private Ryan(1998) and Enemy at the Gates moved me. Apocalypse now makes as much point as the purpose of America's action on Vietnam. \n This film may be overlong, but it has one thing made right, the feel and ambiance of war which most of the other films lack. This film really tells one the real effects of war and the state of mind of the soldiers. It's not duty that drives them, it's madness and the desire to go back to where they came from. This film simply has a weak story, a poor villain who just disappoints everyone after being so vigorously described by the protagonist.

Given that it's a movie made in the late 70's, it's perfectly okay to call it one of the best visual marvels in the history of cinema. Apocalypse Now ranks with the great war movies.",

However, the big problem for me was that the ideas felt forced. (SPOILERS) The man who introduced all these radical ideas was only shown in the last 30 minutes of film. The way he speaks and his flow from thought to thought are genuine but you see no actions of his to back it up. This in turn makes the meanings empty and less meaningful. You could argue that the meanings were meant to be applied to the main characters story but unfortunately it didn't seem fitting enough for him either.",

Death and decay.\nFrancis Ford Coppola intended to depict madness in all it's rainbow spectrum. He, without a shadow of a doubt, succeeded.\nWhether it be through events or characters, dialogue or the constant deep reds and oranges that illustrate the fever and psychosis of Western men, out of their depth.\nTo me, 'Apocalypse Now' is not a war-film, it's not an action-adveture nor horror or thriller. Hell, it's barely an adaptation of 'Heart of Darkness'.\nLike Dante's 'Inferno', the audience can only sit and watch as they are taken on the back of a winding serpent through the seven circles of hell and heat, only to be left in the calm waters of inevitable madness.\nIf one believes the ethos that one should \"suffer for their art\" then that, in my humble opinion, makes 'Apocalypse Now' not only the greatest piece of cinema ever produced, but the finest, most honest work of art to grace any canvas.\n\"Never get out of the boat. Absolutely goddamn right. Unless you were goin' all the way\"",

This film introduces the viewer to the bloody, insane side that they've never seen nor imagined before. The film invokes a general feeling of a world-gone-to-hell, of insanity, and hopelessness.

Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, based on the classic novella, ''Heart of Darkness'' by Joseph Conrad, is a movie that deals with the horror of warfare and does so without simple prejudice or didactics. It goes to darker places than most war movies dare to go and it's no surprise that it's considered by many to be the greatest war movie of all-time. \r\n\r\nWhile retaining the hallucinatory tone and dark themes of Conrad's classic novella, Copolla makes some adjustments to the story. The story is moved from Congo to Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam war. Kurtz, portrayed in the novella as a deranged Ivory dealer, is now a rogue army officer who has committed horrendous acts of brutality and established himself as a Godlike figure to a worshipping tribe. Assigned with the task of assassinating Kurtz is the brilliant but disillusioned Captain Benjamin L.Willard(Martin Sheen). A wonderful parallel is drawn between these two characters and the lines between hero and villain are never clearly defined. \r\n\r\nBefore I continue I should note here that it is the extended redux version I am actually reviewing here, which includes around 30 minutes of extra footage. Critics and audiences alike have been divided in their reaction to this version, in particular to a lengthy scene where Willard and his crew meet a French plantation. This scene, despite reportedly costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, was actually cut from the final scene. Although the sequence adds a more political dimension to the movie it is not difficult to see why it was omitted. While I don't think there is anything particularly wrong with this scene, it does somewhat upset the rhythm and atmosphere of the story. \r\n\r\nSome have likened this movie to Dante's ''Inferno'' and it's easy to see why. Willard and his crew's journey upriver to conquer the enigmatic and brutal Kurtz is akin to a slow fall into the deepest pits of hell, in which the moral codes of normal civilization no longer apply. Besides Willard, the crew themselves consist of mostly very young, irresponsible, and superficially cocksure young soldiers(Laurence Fishburn, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest) and a rigidly moral chief at the rudder(Albert Hall). None of them are permitted by Willard to know the mission objective but they suspect the worst. As the characters descend deeper and deeper into a nightmarish and hostile jungle, an atmosphere of obligatory madness festers. Meanwhile, Willard peruses through files of information on Kurtz, forming a morbid fascination with the man which hovers between admiration and terror.\r\n\r\nMartin Sheen is terrific as Willard, showing the same sort of detached menace he showed us in Badlands. Sheen is a great actor who can hint at some inner madness with his singularly intense stare. Far from a pious war hero Willard is a somewhat dubious and ambiguous figure. We sense that he is not a million miles away from becoming something like the psychopathic murderer he is tracking down. Brando, despite limited screen time, gives a commanding and subtle performance as Kurtz. Like all the great villains of literature or cinema, Kurtz defies simplistic analysis. He is a manipulative and brutal man, but he is also intelligent, eloquent, and charming. The movie is laced with brilliant supporting performances from familiar faces. Robert Duvall contributes greatly with a scene-stealing cameo as a lieutenant(with a penchant for surfing) whose eccentric behaviour during an air strike raid suggests that he has completely lost his marbles. Dennis Hopper shows up as a fast-talking photojournalist who describes Kurtz as a 'great man'. \r\n\r\nThe movie is brilliantly shot and the scenes of battle are at once visceral and gruesome. Grand sweeping lateral tracking shots capture the war-torn environment and tend to evoke a sense of profound aimlessness. Despite their cruel and gory nature, these events are oddly thrilling and exhilarating to behold. The movie is bold enough to suggest that war can be thrilling as well as terrible, and that many of the young men who participate, do so with a perverse rush of pleasure. When the jaded and mentally unhinged crew finally arrive at Kurtz's horrific lair is one of the most memorable and eerie scenes I've ever seen. With bodies hung up in some sick pagan ritual and bones and severed heads  scattered about as if in some macabre nightmare, we witness with uneasy clarity the full extent of the hideous crimes Kurtz has committed. This is a tremendous, visually spectacular and psychologically challenging war movie, and undoubtedly one of the greatest triumphs in the history of cinema.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nThere is simply nothing like Apocalypse Now; a film that digs deeper into the souls of soldiers than any other war film. Francis Ford Coppola's peak was during the 1970s with winning back to back Best Picture at the Academy Awards and the Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival; the director's stronger work winning the latter. It is because of his previous accolades that he was able to make Apocalypse Now, given total creative control and a budget that is more than needed to tell a personal and intimate story such as this; with this, Coppola has definitely gone over his head, with principal photography along lasting over 16 months rather than six weeks that was asked from him; it is because of this sense of trust for the director that he was given this time and patience. I think Coppola had doubts about the film as he was making it, unsure on how he would tell it and whether or not it is remotely effective for the viewer. It is his ego that elevated the film to what it is, becoming more than what it intended to be. Honestly he could have made this film with a straight-forward direction and minimal effort and he probably would have made a masterpiece, as the story and John Milius' screenplay was already brilliant on its own, he simply had to translate and capture it through his camera. Though I'm still glad Apocalypse Now is what it is, because it is an epic piece of cinema that manages to capture the tortured destruction of war, both externally and internally.\n\nApocalypse Now is a deep and dark portrait of war, specifically the Vietnam War. It follows a soldier who begins daydreaming, envisioning his deep desires of being out there in the war and hunting down \"gooks\". He is a representation of the internal damages of war, finding a sense of addiction and craving to be out there in the jungle with a rifle, as the war has made this his core sense of purpose, stripping the emotional affection he has for those he once cherished before the war; his family and his home. This is a person who cannot leave Vietnam, because if he does, he would not be able to adapt to the horrors he has experienced; he hopes to stay within this bubble of destruction and murder, as a way of stabilising his mind and body. The idea of being idle is his worst enemy, leading him to poor alternatives of speeding up time; alcohol, sleep, and isolation. It is through these that the darker demons that grew and loiter within him during the war start to emerge; leading him to state of external madness and depression, unable to compose himself and placing himself in a state of physical pain and emotional harm. Only a mission, a sense of purpose and value, could save him from such a dire state.\n\nA mission he most certainly gets, but this time, it is much more serious and stranger than he has ever come across. It involves the assassination of a soldier who once fought for the same side; he supposedly has gone mad, taking matters in his own hands and achieving his intended goals through unusual methods. It is here that the film begins to question on whether Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, the intended target, is truly a madman or is he the only one in this war that is committed to do something about it. His methods may be unusual and out of order, but it does gain results, and isn't that the intention of all this war and destruction, to achieve that larger goal? Why must many lives need to be spared for this to be achieved? Since the war has shown to drive everyone mad in their own sort of way, is Kurtz simply a madman shaded in a different colour; is he any different from Captain Willard or Lieutenant Kilgore? It is a figure, and a puzzle, that constantly grow on our minds, wanting to understand him; we naturally become attracted to the mystery that lurks around him. By the end, it never gave me the answer I wanted, but that is what makes the film so perfect; here it presents us a figure who seemingly have been stripped of human complexity, yet he comes off as an enigma through all of it. I could never pin him down as a subject or an idea, and because of this lack of resolution, the film attracts me into revisiting it, hoping that maybe I'll learn more about him.\n\nIn reaching to Kurtz, Willard is accompanied by four other soldiers by boat, taking him up the river that ends with his intended destination. It is in their journey together that kept me hooked throughout, a story of a man sending these four gentlemen to their eventual madness, indirectly breaking them to a point where repair back to normality may be impossible. It is at the start of their journey where they all had a conscience, being able to look at their world with innocent and logical eyes; but as they journey closer and closer to their destination, they pass by and encounter areas or events that one by one breaks away the pillars of their sense of humanity, reaching closer and deeper into their primal instincts; becoming animals, like a tiger in a jungle. It is the fact that these were four individuals, who were simply there as escorts and supports, unintentionally losing and indirectly destroying themselves for someone else's cause; it becomes an even more painful experience with each revisit, as we have the burden of knowing their fate, knowing that nothing can be done and we have to simply just sit there and watch them disintegrate.\n\nVisually, Apocalypse Now is a stunning picture, a film that perfectly captures the horrors of war. A film filled with visual destruction and internal depth, which is something very few war films have been able to do. The film was photography was handled by Vittorio Storaro, who has worked on other notable films including The Last Emperor and The Last Tango in Paris. Though I personally found The Last Emperor a much more superior work from the cinematographer, his contribution to Apocalypse Now is nothing short of amazing. He perfectly captures the film's scope through the intended use of location shooting and using an abundance of practical effects to mimic the honest conditions of the war. Storaro and Coppola has conjured up some of the most iconic images ever to be put in cinema; how can one forget the amazing helicopter assault on the coast, it is simply a breathtaking experience that created deep chills shooting up and down my spine. The film also manages to perfectly capture the film's internal story, capturing intense moments during their journey by boat, conveying character development in all of its characters. It allows the audience to get under the skin of its subjects, feeling and understanding their fears and joys. The film then becomes more stylish and personal during the end of the river, where we finally see Kurtz and his compound. A sense of darkness looms over the environment and the character, projecting rich detail of the mysterious character; refusing to shine the character in a warm and welcoming light, keeping the audience in constant thought and wonder.\n\nThe performances in this film were outstanding, with Martin Sheen arguably at his best as an actor. He perfectly breaks the cool, laid back image he projected upon me in Terrence Malick's Badlands, and finally shows the actor in a more harsh and painful light. His entire contribution in this film, including his usage of narration, elevates the film's story and visuals; conveying the film's deeper themes and ideas without resulting to obvious execution. Marlon Brando was also great in this film for the very short time he has on it, but I still feel that Sheen was the better performer; though I did enjoy the many monologue he gives in the film, coming off more as poetry rather than speeches. Robert Duvall as Kilgore was also fantastic in the short time he is in, coming off as eccentric and unpredictable. All three are roles that I cannot imagine another actor inhabiting; perfection like this is truly hard to come by.\n\nApocalypse Now is tied with The Conversation as Francis Ford Coppola's magnum opus, but it does lead the charge as my favourite war film of all time. There will never be another Apocalypse Now but there will be many imitations that would further add the brilliance of Coppola's film.\n\nI have owned the film for about two years now and I still haven't given the Redux cut an attempt. Is it necessary for me to see it? I already consider the original cut of the film to be perfect. Will the addition of the French plantation sequence improve the way I would see the film? Let me know in the comment section in regarding to this predicament.",

            "content": "The opening scene depicts Martin Sheen's Captain Willard having a breakdown, drunk and covered in his own blood, wrecking his hotel room in frustration. His voice-over hints strongly at what we now recognize as PTSD, which for him manifests as an inability to readjust to civilian life. He knows he's unwell, unfit for duty even, so when the army sends a couple of fresh-faced soldiers to his room with a summons, he assumes they're there to arrest him. But no, it's an assignment. Because, as it turns out, he's the most level-headed person in the movie, and as it unfolds he seems to be the most well-adjusted Westerner in all of Vietnam. That comparison says less about him than the people he encounters as he heads upriver: Robert Duvall as a hilariously (a better adjective would be \"sickeningly\" if the tone wasn't so hyperbolic) amoral colonel, young soldiers turned feral by the loss of their commanders, and finally Colonel Kurtz, a man perhaps so unmoored by the horrors of war that he's come full circle and achieved a kind of clarity. In much the same vein as Werner Herzog's \"Aguirre: The Wrath of God\" (1972), which follows a conquistador's journey down the Amazon and into madness, Coppola's cameras and the atmosphere of the river work to make Willard's boat journey a disorienting, mind-altering experience. \"Apocalypse Now\" is not a critique of a futile war, at least not any more than Herzog's movie is a critique of conquistadors: it doesn't try to provide answers or even to depict reality, but to convey the feeling of becoming lost in a primeval place that makes civilized notions of identity and morality seem like quaint inventions. In other words, it is much more a \"Heart of Darkness\" adaptation than it is a Vietnam War movie, and is best enjoyed with that in mind. Visually, Coppola nails it. Misty jungles loom around the boat, grinding away at the sanity of those aboard. The camera spins and rolls, faces come in and out of view as the light waxes to spotlight brightness and fades to pitch black, and bodies are strewn everywhere like a house of horrors. The soundtrack and script are more debatable. The music of The Doors fits the atmosphere perfectly, but it's so well-known outside of the movie that it takes me out of it. At times, Sheen's voice-over narration seems overwritten, like something from Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe. \"I hardly said a word to my wife, until I said yes to a divorce,\" he deadpans at the beginning. But if \"Apocalypse Now\" is not perfect, and if the runtime of the director's cut is a bit too long, it is easily a substantial and artful enough work to reward repeat viewings.",

So what was Apocalypse Now really about ? What was Coppola trying to prove ? \nIt's something bewilderingly spectacular. Just awfully provoking and intriguing.\n\nWe start off, with what I personally believe, is one of the most beautiful and opening scene. We see a thick canopy of trees. Wilderness. Mother Nature in all it's beauty. But there's a catch, we're not here to admire it's beauty, we're here to watch it burn. 'The End' by The Doors play in the background as Mother Nature is blown up, with Martin Sheen's face inter cutting. Chaos and destruction, beautifully captured by Coppola. \nAll of this being , the hallucination of the protagonist, Captain Benjamin Willard (Sheen).\nI'm not really a fan of destruction and chaos, but the way it has been shot, Coppola is a true genius. But this is just the beginning, the real genius of Coppola is yet to come, again and again and again.\n\nThe movie follows Captain Willard, desperate to get back into the Vietnamese jungle, now lives his life in a claustrophobic motel, descending into sudden fit of frustration from time to time. Atlast, Willard is assigned for a real mission, something he had been craving for. His mission -  to exterminate the command of Col. Walter Kurtz (Brando) who is believed to have set himself up as a God among his Montagnard army inside Cambodia. The reason , well, his methods were 'unsound'.\nWe meet Col. Kilgore on the way, who is supposedly 'Sane', because his passion for destruction is acted upon 'orders from his superiors'. This is the moment when we get to hear the iconic line 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' .\nDuring the journey , we get know more and more about Kurtz, as Willard flips through his dossier. Decorated, successful and extremely efficient. Willard starts to grow a sense of admiration towards Kurtz. \nHere's something about Kurtz,  He is accused of being 'insane', because he took matters in his own hands and followed 'unsound' methods. But Kurtz was sharp. He knew where to hit. \nWillard reaches his destination. But can he execute what he was sent for ? Can he do it, after witnessing the 'horror' and understanding it ? More importantly, the man himself, who is this mystical personality Kurtz ? \nAll these questions lead to a stirring and deep ending. One which is thought provoking and spectacular in all sense. \n\nApocalypse Now is by far THE Best Movie I have seen. The story itself is quite intriguing. The direction is marvelous. From the opening scene, the hallucinations of Willard, the airstrike on the village by Capt Kilgore and his boys, the ending scene. All of them, visual  masterpieces. Not to mention the intercutting scenes which have been wonderfully used. Francis Ford Coppola's brilliance is right there, throughout the movie. \nCoppola is an inarguable genius.   \nThe cinematography, the camera, the lighting, editing. Technicality is at it's peak. Perfection has been achieved in almost every aspects. \nA stellar performance by the Cast. Marlon Brando is awfully amazing.  Robert Duvall's Kilgore was a great performance. Martin Sheen lags behind these two heavy weights even though he has the central role. \n \nApocalypse Now is not a war movie per se. It's a horrific, hypnotic and aural wonder. \nBest Film Ever.",

I like Duvall's character - Kilgore - crazy, electric, energetic, charismatic. Duvall's performance was memorable. Still don't understand what's the big deal about his famous quote regarding the smell of napalm in the morning though. Colonel Kurtz is just sad, pretentious, and pathetic. Don't know why they need to eliminate him, he just wanted to be in the cave with his indigenous posse and recite rubbish poems. Leave the man alone, he just wanted to get with the nature. By the end of the film, the plot has led me to believe that this film was completely unnecessary. 2 stars for Capt. Kilgore, the mango picking scene in the forest with the tiger, and the ritual killing of the water buffalo.",

This movie, captures a dark and visceral tale of two men with very similar mentalities colliding into one unexplainable and haunting end.  Martin Sheen, who apparently was drunk and heavily drugged throughout the making of this movie, plays a very unmoved and apathetic Captain, charged with the seemingly unobtainable task of killing a rouge officer deep in the heart of Vietnam.  Of course the madness of the Capt. Willard (Sheen) only allows us to grasp the destructive nature of war and the toll it takes on the human soul.  As Sheen is required to appear as a man who has given himself over to madness, it fits well that he is actually suffering a sense of real madness (drug induced) throughout the filming of the movie.  The lighting and sound are spectacular.  The movie would be nothing with out the music of the Coppolas, who single handily set the stage for what we were intended to feel.  The spectacular and surreal scenes: from the masses of people to the explosions of napalm, all of which cost $31 million dollars  made it clear that goal of the movie was to achieve greatness, and nothing less.  And this film did just that.",

            "content": "Before this film, I have read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, which tells of a mission embarked by Charles Marlow to find an agent called Mr. Kurtz, and if you have read my review on the novel, then you would know that overall I like the book, and if you have not, well, now you know. Anyways, I later learned that Francis Ford Coppola (director of the legendary Godfather trilogy) had directed a film loosely based upon the novel, called Apocalypse Now and I read about it. What's interesting is that the film takes place, not in Africa as in the novel, but in Vietnam during the Vietnam War, so I'd thought that I should give the film a try. Plus it has a few Oscar and Golden Globe awards to it, and a Palm d'Or win at the Cannes Festival, so why not?\n\nThe story, like Heart of Darkness, is about the search for a man by the name of Kurtz. Instead of Charles Marlow, the protagonist is Benjamin Willard and he is a veteran U.S. army officer who has before this served 3 years in Vietnam. He is asked to return to search for Colonel Kurtz, who went rogue and murdered four Vietnamese people. Along the way upriver, Willard and his boat crew encounters distractions which include communists shooting at them, a false alarm, a stop at an army base for refills and a whole bunch of titties. For those who have read the novel - or rather novella - of course, Willard eventually finds Kurtz, who becomes a leader of an indigenous tribe in the jungle. The film slowly enters its harrowing climax before ending a little too quickly. \n\nThis is what I think of the film. It is the first I have seen to be significantly longer than the novella it is based upon. Three quarters of the film drag on quite relentlessly at an excruciatingly slow pace (slower than that of the novella) but somehow, I find myself still more than willing to sit through the three hours of the movie. The acting is amazing. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall offer spectacular performances (despite the fact that the latter two appear for slightly less than a quarter of the film), especially Duvall (Arthur \"Boo\" Radley in To Kill A Mockingbird). His portrayal as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore is perhaps the liveliest thing about the film. For this, Duvall was nominated and won Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars and Golden Globes, respectively. Overall execution of the plot is highly effective. The screenplay is also not too bad, drawing some familiar statements from within the original novella. The film could have ended better, however. Apart from the way Kurtz died, I was half-expecting the film to end with Willard informing a family member of Kurtz of what happened to him, as what Marlow did in Heart of Darkness. I was only a little disappointed that Mr. Coppola could have at least given an ending that would give the film a proper closure. Well, that's just me, I guess. At least, they had 'The horror... the horror...'.  \n\nAnyway, I find that the film succeeds extraordinarily well in its technical aspects, especially the cinematography and sound effects, both of which won for their respective categories at the Oscars. Almost the entire movie consists of the play and trickery of light to create atmospheres and set moods. There is also the off-centre shots, strong and garish back light, shadow play, light beams and a whole lot of lens flares. It may not be so visually appealing (some of the lens flares are blinding) but I will admit that the cinematography is extremely impressive. Sound effects, perfect. Not missing any details whatsoever. The overall execution is amazing. The war scene in the beginning is simply stunning and dazzling, with sweeping bird's-eye shots and a raging inferno. The score by Carmine and Francis Ford Coppola is not what I would call my type of music, but it is no doubt quite impressive, and it earned them a Golden Globe for Best Original Score. \n\nOverall, quite an impressive epic war film, which somehow seems to stretch longer than its source material despite leaving out the ending of the latter. A harrowing depiction of war and a great tale of duty and honour.",

            "content": "One word: WOW. Very few movies can expertly blend action, dark humor, great dialogue, and spectacular acting as well as Apocalypse Now does. Although it's critically acclaimed, I find it to be underrated (even at 99%). It's Francis Ford Coppola's best film, and features the director at both his most unrestrained and imaginative. The cinematography is both memorable and chilling, and some of the scenes are downright biblical. Make no mistake, this is an incredible experience for film buffs-- But it's not pretentious or boring. Even for viewers who value explosions and one-liners the most, this will entertain. Unless you're looking for a romantic comedy, this movie will have something for you.\r\n\r\nIn case you've been living under a rock since the 70s, I'll clue you in: Apocalypse Now is the story of a young special forces agent (Martin Sheen before he became president) who is assigned to kill a rogue colonel in the field (Marlon Brando) at the height of the Vietnam War. Sheen is perfect for the role, and for those of you who thought he was too much of a goody two-shoes in The West Wing (myself included), this is the movie to watch. He clearly has fun with the role, and uses it to show off his wide range of acting skills. He's both a sympathetic and cynical character who doesn't really know what to believe after seeing some horrible shit in Nam. Also, it features Harrison Ford cameo. So that gets bonus points.\r\n\r\nNow on to the cinematography: GOOD HOLY GOD. This movie was made more than thirty years ago, and it still has better and more imaginative visuals than Avatar, The Avengers, or any of the other visual-reliant movies these days. Apocalypse Now doesn't completely lean on visuals to carry the movie, but if it did, they would just about carry it. Coppola has crafted some seriously mesmerizing visuals here, and they capture the anus of the world that is Vietnam in a nutshell. One scene, in which a USO performance involving scantily clad dancers goes awry, is particularly memorable. It's both visually haunting and absolutely fucking genius in creating an atmosphere of immorality and chaos. It's not particularly subtle, but it really doesn't need to be-- the movie hits you with blunt force from the beginning and never lets up.\r\n\r\nEssentially every scene of this movie is memorable, but I'll pick the one that I personally loved the most: Flight of the Valkyries. In this scene, a lieutenant colonel aptly named Kilgore (Robert Duvall) wants to inspire his troops before storming a North Vietnamese stronghold from helicopters. And so he blasts the epic Flight of the Valkyries over the radio system, blaring it for all the world to hear and creating one of the most incredible scenes in cinematic history. The juxtaposition of the Americans flying in trumpeting their imminent victory and the destitute, war-weary Vietnamese soldiers on the ground trying to prepare for their imminent loss is enough to send chills up your spine. \r\n\r\nThis movie is also insanely quotable. From \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\" to \"The horror... the horror,\" this movie has more than a couple of entries on the top 100 best movie quotes of all time. But the best lines, as always, are spoken by Brando, who gives the performance of a lifetime. His poet warlord character is both despicable and spellbinding, and although you know you're supposed(?) to want him dead, you can't help but feel that he knows more about the world than those around him. His exchanges with Sheen are legendary, including \"You're an errand boy... send by grocery clerks to collect a bill,\" and one of my favorites: \"Are my methods... unsound?\" \"I don't believe there is method, sir.\" Absolutely classic.\r\n\r\nThe action is spectacular and awesome to watch, but it never detracts from the story. In a way, the minimal special effects of the era in which this movie was made adds to it. There's no slow-motion bullshit or ridiculous stunts. It's a reality-based, powerful movie with fittingly realistic action. Not only that, but it's got psychedelic visuals and an ethereal, enchanting musical score. This isn't just a movie for the ages, it's a movie for ETERNITY-- Because no matter whether it's viewed 100, 1,000, or a million years from now, the truths it exposes about humanity's tolerance and capacity for cruelty will still ring true.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for Apocalypse Now: I award this movie the rare and distinguished Tut 10/10 stars. Even if it is a little long, there's not a second I would edit out. It's visually grand, enthralling, and is basically just a massive stroke of cinematic genius. It's a bummer that the production of this movie almost bankrupted Coppola, as it's hard to shoot a Vietnam War epic of this scale with a low budget. But after a few decades, the movie speaks for itself. I rarely say this, but if you don't like this movie, you need to go out and buy some better taste. Or stop watching Scary Movie and its sequels. Because after seeing Apocalypse Now, you will have a much greater appreciation of cinema. Coppola has waged a psychological war with the audience, and he won. This is the film for people who are serious about being movie buffs.",

In many ways, this is a penultimate horror film; not one plagued with spooky ghosts or psychotic serial killers, but one showing us one of the world's greatest horrors: war. The haunting nature of Apocalypse Now is brutally resonant, and while it has a daunting run time, there's never a truly dull moment. Each scene feels integral to the overall story and message at hand. Martin Sheen makes for a hugely compelling lead, and the supporting cast all give strong performances as well. The great Marlon Brando is perhaps the most fascinating, giving the character of Kurtz a subtle yet mystical, and quite chilling, personality. In terms of production values, it's mindblowing how visually stunning this film is considering its numerous production troubles. Francis Ford Coppola really did a superb job with this film. The sets are massive and lifelike, which becomes even more noticeable during the film's numerous action setpieces, all of which are beautifully shot. The sound design is also top notch, perhaps some of the best of all time.

            "content": "The horror... the horror\". These are the last lines uttered in the 1979 classic epic Apocalypse Now by The Godfather director, Francis Ford Coppola. Set in Vietnam, the film takes us through the psychological and physical battles that our main character, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) endures throughout the course of his top-secret mission to kill the gone rogue, Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Set in Vietnam during the height of the war, the film is not necessarily a Vietnam film, but a film set in Vietnam, as the war itself is not the main focus besides showing the horrors of war.\n\nStarting off with a now classic intro of Willard lying in his bedroom while the song, \"The End\" by the Doors plays interlaced with scenes of destruction in the jungle, the film sets the tone  as we see Willard is a damaged good, who claims that his new mission was going to be his last.\n\nThe cinematography in this film was truly breathtaking, with beautiful shots of jungles and rivers. And then there's the fantastic scene in which helicopters attack a beach with Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" playing.\n\nThe acting in this film was brilliant, from Martin Sheen's psychological portrayal of Willard, to Marlon Brando's incredible performance as Kurtz, to Robert Duvall's performance of the wisecracking Kilgore. There were superb performances from all around, including a young 14 year old (at the time of the beginning of filming; he was 17 when it finished filming), Laurence Fishburne, now known for his roles in the TV series Hannibal, and the film, The Matrix.\n\nOverall, this was a film that justified its troubled and problematic production, with fantastic cinematography, acting performances, and just a fantastic script and plot [based on Heart of Darkness (1902) by Joseph Conrad], the film was everything that it was made out to be, and even better than that. Apocalypse Now is definitely one movie that you must see before you die.",

            "content": "War is horror\n\nApocalypse Now does not make much sense to analyze with Story Charts because it's not really a movie. It's a piece of historical social commentary on the non-nonsensical nature of war by showing us a collage of scenes that outline the ridiculousness and craziness of war.\n\nYou can see this on the Story Chart: there is no Internal Change for anyone (Willard starts out dazed and broken, and he ends up the same way). There is no Relationship change. There is just the external quest of the mission to kill Kurtz by going up river (seems like a metaphor for some sort of mindless journey). And an illustrative tapestry of crazy scenes you find along the way.\n\nThe movie does not PROVE the central idea that \"War is horror\", it just shows us the effects of war. That's why to me it's not a real movie, just a series of muddled situations that is somehow supposed to mirror the craziness of war. It shows us as opposed to making us feel the central idea by seeing a tight story propelled by the choices of the characters. Sure the scenery is memorable and the situations weird and unforgettable, but so is a National Geographic article.\n\nhttp://www.storycharts.ca/story/122029/5799236641751040/Film/Apocalypse_Now",

            "content": "The history and production behind this film is almost just as spectacular as the film itself. Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic that tells the story of Captain Willard on a mission to terminate Col. Kurtz command as he has become rogue and conducting operations with the locals. Kurtz has been labelled by the U.S. Forces as insane and his methods are unsound. This film does not focus on the exciting action part of the war but rather what the war does to a person. The film does have moments of epic destruction but it supports the point that Coppola is trying to make. To truly enjoy this film, you must come in with the right mindset or this film would be seen as a big disappointment.\n\nThe film is based on a novel by Joseph Conrad titled Heart of Darkness and was written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola and John Milius. Coppola and Milius has taken Conrad's story and placed it within the Vietnam War which I thought worked. Coppola and Milius has created a screenplay that gives us a look on the horrors of war whether it's on a grand scale, like the killing of civilians, or on a personal level, Willard in his hotel room. Willard is escorted to Kurtz by a boat crew who at the start seems like normal guys in the war, just having fun and doing what they are supposed to do, but as they go further and further down the river they start to lose themselves and become more primal. The writers have not only added a straightforward story of a mission but also the disintegration of one's super-ego and has been stripped down to just the id. When they have gone past the last outpost, where every soldier seems to have gone mad, they found Kurtz. This is the point where things become less easy to tolerate as I had to watch this film at least 4 times to at least get a grasp of the point. Is Kurtz more evil or insane than any of the other soldiers napalming villages? It's really interesting how Coppola and Milius tackled this and makes us think about morality and whether or not our own super-ego is really more wiser than our own instinct.\n\nThe 1970's is a great decade for him, as all of his directorial efforts in that period were nominated for Best Picture and two of which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Apocalypse Now is definitely his most ambitious film as the first 3 quarters of the film just shows where most of his budget went. The napalm, ordered by Col. Kilgore, on that village was a fantastic scene and knowing that back then post production effects couldn't do something like that made the scene all the more impressive. Though this film has it's epic moments, it's the intimate scenes in the boat or at Kurtz's compound where I felt this film really shined. Too bad Coppola did not find the same acclaim in his future films, maybe except The Godfather Part 3.\n\nThe film was photographed by Vittorio Storaro who also did The Last Emperor, and his efforts here is just as important as Coppola's contributions as he is responsible for making the scenes look spectacular. Storaro's best captured moments in the film were at the big time war sequences, and as the film progresses it becomes more darker and moody. On daytime scenes, the image gives off a sunrise or sunset kind of feel to it which I think worked for the film. I like the way Brando was captured, consumed by the darkness making it feel artful.\n\nCarmine Coppola is the composer for this film. The film's score sounds like something that came off either from A Clockwork Orange or The Shining, using some sort of synthesizer to manipulate the sound in order to create that tension in the track. I don't think it was that much of a standout but it does work. What did standout was the soundtrack, they come in full force. Moments like the helicopter scenes using Ride of the Valkyries or that scene on the boat where The Rolling Stone's 'I Can't Get No Satisfaction\" was playing through Clean's radio. Coppola's score is more present as they go down the river and pop songs that were found in the first track were gone. Also this film is loud, this was one of the first films to ever have a 5.1 mix and the results are booming.\n\nThe acting is on this film is great. I especially like the subtle things that are found on the boat ride that makes the scene just a little more realistic and gives a little more personality to the characters. Willard, for the most part, doesn't try to outshine anybody but rather just keeping it simple. There is a scene though in his hotel room where you can really feel the damage of Willard and it's one of the moments that really stand out in Sheen's acting. I'm not even sure he was acting because he was an alcoholic then. Brando didn't wow me like he did in The Godfather but he was poetic and artful in his acting. He was consumed in Darkness for the most of the film so most of his acting came from his facial expression. Robert Duvall didn't have a large role in this film but when he came on, he was going all out. I preferred him here than he was in The Godfather. Dennis Hopper as the photojournalist was the one where I never really understood because it felt like his lines were improvised and was talking in code, but it was still somewhat relevant to the plot. The supporting cast were good, the moments in the boat were fantastic and that one cameo by Coppola and Storaro were hilarious.\n\nThis film is something that grew on me with multiple viewings. This is up there with my Coppola favorites and at par with The Conversation, which I think is his best work. This film is deep and doesn't try to wow you but rather have you thinking. Just try to make sure you watch this with the right mindset to truly enjoy this film.",

            "content": "Apocalypse Now is the greatest war film ever made, and no other film comes close to this one. I couldn't believe my eyes during this weird, haunting trip, and although it's a long one, I forgot reality existed and I was absorbed into the depressing, frightening life of horror of Martin Sheen's character's, Captain Willard, life living in the Vietnam war. This is probably what seems like Francis Ford Coppola's last true great film in his career, and it doesn't seem like he ever really reached the heights of his previous, groundbreaking career again that resulted in some of the greatest films ever made, from the Godfather to this. This is a disturbing, scary, intense, and very sad journey through the absolute chaos and horrors of war, and I was no less than riveted by the end of the movie, although some may be thrown off by its deliberate pacing. If anything, I actually thought the deliberate pace added to the experience, and it gave you a better picture of the scenario by really introducing you to the madness of the lives of these soldiers.\n\nIt may be unfair to compare this film to Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, but they do share the same general message regarding the chaos of war. Full Metal Jacket is perhaps far more accessible and rewarding, and it highlights more of the comradery of soldiers during the Vietnam war. However, Apocalypse Now (at least in my opinion) has far more depth and highlights more on the psychological aspect of the soldiers' experience through the horrors of war. Don't get me wrong, Full Metal Jacket is still a superb movie, but I don't quite feel like it has as much depth as Apocalypse Now. While Full Metal Jacket had humor and some light-hearted moments, Apocalypse Now is purely a descent into the darkness and madness of war, and it doesn't attempt to sugarcoat any of the brutality, and it adds a bucket load of symbolism and profoundness on top of it. \n\nI've heard many complaints of the film having absolutely no plot, but I'm perplexed by that remark, and sure, Apocalypse Now is not as plot-driven as it is character-driven, but the experiences Captain Willard faces are the result of the mission he is given. It still does have a progressing plot, though, and it's about Captain Willard (Martin Sheen), who is assigned on a dangerous mission into a Cambodian jungle to find and kill Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who is rumored to have gone insane and turned into a warlord, now commanding his own set of troops inside the jungle. Willard is also accompanied by a crew of young soldiers, including a young Laurence Fishburne. The film takes place during the Vietnam war, and as I said, it highlights Willard's psychological experience more than the plot, but it still progresses. I was on the edge of my seat for the whole movie purely because of how mysterious the scenario was, and what motivated Kurtz to become the man he is rumored to currently be.\n\nThe acting is phenomenal stuff here, especially Martin Sheen as the leading role. Martin supposedly got a heart attack during the filming, and Marlon Brando was overweight so they had to cover that fact by using a \"shadow\" effect on his body. Martin also improvised a scene a few minutes after the opening where he punches a mirror to portray the struggles of his character, and his hand was bleeding. Yet, both of these things show Martin's commitment to this role, and he was powerful here. He nails down the psychological aspect of soldiers during the war perfectly. Marlon Brando is perfect and very peculiar here as well, and I don't want to spoil anything about his character, but he seriously shows how profound of an actor he is here. Robert Duvall also makes an appearance as Captain Kilgore, and he evoked both emotions of fear and odd laughter, and he also said one of the film's most famous lines, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning!\". Harrison Ford makes a small appearance as the man who gives Willard the mission, as well as Dennis Hopper, who's a reporter, which were both great.\n\nAfter the riveting opening scene with The Door's song \"The End\", there is a conversation about the task that Harrison Ford is giving to Willard, and although it feels somewhat relaxed, it gives the viewer of an idea of what's to come ahead, and all of it still feels unsettling. It becomes far more unsettling than that, almost beyond comprehension, and it is a pure descent into the intensity and horrors of war. There are two kids of intensity and suspense- there's the high-octane, fast-paced intensity and suspense, and there's the slow-building, chilling type of intensity and suspense. The latter is used here, and very effectively, making for some of the most terrifying moments I've ever seen in a movie. It is very bleak and dark, and at times it's heart-wrenching and gut-wrenching. The finale is one of the best I've seen in a film, and I'm not really sure why I hear lots of complaints about the final confrontation during the last half hour. It does change the pace and the mood of the film, and it is strange, but it still packs such a punch of terror that it's hard to deny the stunning quality of it.\n\nEven the whole film itself looks stunning, and it's evident that a large budget was put into this movie, whether it's the effects or the overall cinematography, and both are very impressive. They're perfectly used to encapsulate the bleakness and darkness of the war, and it's hard not to be affected by them. It's not quite as disturbing when it comes to gore then when it comes to the psychology of the characters, but the experiences are emotionally powerful and equally as gut-wrenching as a bucket of carnage and gore. It's thought-provoking material, and its sheer scope as a war film helps the emotional effects become more haunting and ugly (despite a stunning and impressive style, that is). Its style is unconventional and daunting, and it's hard to look at times, yet it's impossible to resist. Even its soundtrack is very eerie and haunting, and its a highlight of the film's style as well. This movie will stay with you for a very long time after watching it, and takes the war concept to a new level in a very different path than most.\n\nThere's a ton of symbolism in the film too, especially in the last half hour. It may confuse some, because those last thirty minutes are odd and surreal stuff, but if you look a little deeper and put your full attention, you'll easily understand the sheer power and significance of the scenes. There's lots of fog throughout the journey on the river they're travelling on, and they represent the alienation of Willard and his crew as they're heading towards an unknown territory where the mysterious Colonel Kurtz is supposedly prospering, adding a true sense of fear to both the soldiers and the audience. The river is almost a metaphor on itself of their journey and their experiences leading towards the peculiar Kurtz, and the last few shots of the film are some of the best ever put to screen. Without spoiling, they represent so many things that it would take a long time to list it all. You realize so much by the end of the film, and it is pure insanity for its whole entirety. In no way did I see this movie as a pro-war film, and it's the complete opposite.\n\nHollywood needs to make more movies like this, but unfortunately it's not too often that a movie as profound and sophisticated as this comes out, at least in wide-release. This is the highest tier of filmmaking, and it's nothing short of one of the greatest films I've ever seen, as well as the greatest war film I've seen. I haven't seen the Redux version yet, which is a longer version, and I'm skeptical that it may become dragged and it may take away from the quality of the film, but I'm still going to watch it anyways. Francis Ford Coppola is a genius, and this is one of his greatest achievements. It's gotten even better with age, and its poetic beauty is just as effective. It certainly deserves every bit of respect as one of the greatest movies ever made, and leaving this film at least not a little affected is practically impossible. Apocalypse Now is definitely one of the most extraordinary achievements of American cinema.",

The film has a countless amount of flaws: very little character development, inconsistent pacing and bloated running time, but it's the journey itself that really matters, overcomes these flaws and makes the film so unique. As Coppola himself perfectly described: \"My film is not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam.\" It puts you in the middle of the war, you go through all the madness, chaos and carnage with the soldiers, and when it reaches its climax at Kurtz's temple, it is immensely rewarding. The entire cast (Martin Sheen, Frederic Forrest, Albert Hall and Dennis Hopper, among others) is terrific, even Marlon Brando, who famously shocked Coppola by arriving to the set overweight and unprepared for his role, and improvised all his scenes and dialogue. But it is Robert Duvall who steals the show here with his Oscar-nominated performance as the lunatic Lt. Kilgore. There are many great war films out there, most notably Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket and Platoon, but they are no challenge for this mesmerizing cinematic leviathan. If there's one war film everyone should see, it is definitely this one.",

He creates a world and atmosphere where our inner demons are ebbing there way out, and insanity may be what you need to survive. There are very few films that match Coppola's realistic and horrifying depiction of war, Stone's Platoon and Malick's The Thin Red Line are the only anti-war films that makes you think more about the terrifying and absurd nature of war, or makes you feel more frightened for these men's lives.

I saw the \"Redux\" version with 40 additional minutes of footage and I thought it was an amazing story with amazing themes and spectacular acting.  In this film, the acting and the tone really stood out to me.  This movie had a very real feel to it for me.  It was a seemingly simple thing that pulled me in; it was the scene near the beginning where the commanders bring Martin Sheen's character into the room and are trying to see if he's the man for the job to assassinate Kurtz.  I felt like this exchange was acted the way it would have gone in real life; there was an obvious tension, and air of avoidance of details and veiled requests.  It reminded me of project meetings I've been in lately; it felt like a slice of real life with real people.  And that style of acting was carried out throughout the rest of the film, in my opinion.  I think Martin Sheen was aboslutely awsome (and also, Charlie Sheen really looks so much like his father does in this film, it freaked me out a little) and Marlon Brando's performance, though brief, is legendary.  I also enjoyed Dennis Hopper and Robert Duvall's smaller roles in the film.  Duvall's character will forever be a favourite of mine, the way he so confidently carried himself.  I like how things would explode right beside him or enemy fire would come his way and every person around him ducked for cover, but Duvall's character just stood calm and confident and often ignored the danger.  I thought it was highly amusing. And, of course, this film is thick with themes and commentaries on war and how it affects people.  I think that Apocalypse Now is the best Vietnam War based film I have ever seen and I think it is a masterpiece film.  I was enthralled by it from beginning to end.",

A masterfully crafted psychedelic trip through the jungles of Vietnam. The notorious and uncontrollable Colonel Kurtz must be found and must be eliminated and Captain Willard is the man put on the mission. Captain Willard is played by Martin Sheen with a stone-faced gritty approach to the character that, surprisingly, works. Colonel Kurtz is played by the 100 pounds over weight Marlon Brando who didn't have much to do with Colonel Kurtz yet was able to express the man's diabolical sense of war with ease. The real brilliance of the film in my opinion is the feeling it leaves the audience with...HORROR. Everyone in the room felt a bit of disgust in their gut, a slight feeling of sadness in their heart, and the feeling as if they just experienced war. That is exactly how the film wants the audience to feel. War ain't pretty. War is dark. War is sad. War is wrong. Above all else, war is horror. In war everyone and everything is the enemy, even your own country. That felt all more than real in the Ride of the Valkyries scene. American forces show no remorse on the villages they invade, even when it's occupied with a school full of innocent children. With a squad commanded by Bill Kilgore, played with a phenomenal performance by Robert Duvall, every piece of the village is destroyed in a horrific and sick fashion and the soldiers love it. The message hit me loud and clear...war is wrong, plain and simple. In my opinion this is the most important war film ever made and it is due to the emotional trip it puts the audience through. This is the definition of war, this is what war feels like, and if you don't like the feeling this film leaves you with than it accomplished everything it wanted to accomplish.",

            "content": "How does the song go? \"I'll never listen to 'The End' the same way... again?\"  If you were familiar with the music by The Doors, it would be easy to describe, thematically, Apocalypse Now by drawing parallels to that song.  To whoever thought of using the song as sort of a theme song for the movie, good on you, mate.\nApocalypse Now is the definitive war film. Not just for Vietnam War, but any war. The soldiers who were there may not have asked for a war film that cut all of the idealized nonsense, but Francis Ford Coppola was ready to serve anyway. The movie follows Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen), a veteran soldier residing in Saigon long enough to drive a man crazy. He does not reach that point though, as he is soon assigned a mission to terminate a long-standing U.S. officer named Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando). Rumours tell that he has reached the breaking point, ignoring all military commands and forming his own outpost where he may dwell with his broken self, and anyone that chooses to join him.\nKurtz's outpost is located in the heart of Cambodia, far up a river that Willard and his team must travel by boat. On the way, Willard fights alongside an all-star cast (though the film is what launched the careers of some of these actors), including the napalm-hungry commander Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall), Mr. Clean (Lawrence Fishburne, only a teenager at the time), and a hippie journalist (Dennis Hopper). Really, every performance was superb, even from lesser-known actors like Frederic Forrest and Albert Hall.\nBefore and at the beginning of the breach up through the river are the moments of relief. Certainly some of that relief is comic, especially during the Playboy show for a crowd of horny U.S. soldiers. In a certain light, even the scene of Kilgore leading helicopter squads to gunning down a Vietnam town to the sound of Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" is relieving, when the moment is already gone. (By the way, Robert Duvall is irresistible as a war buff. I wish I had a boss like that.)\nDuring the whole boat ride, Willard studies deeply into the personal records of Col. Kurtz. He rapidly grows more sympathetic for Kurtz, as he gets closer to fulfilling his mission. The cross under the Do Lung Bridge is like entering a portal to Hell. The music score maddens with the minds of Willard's crewmates, who do not even know of Willard's mission.\nOnce Willard does find Kurtz, the film is further sealed as timeless. I give much credit to Martin Sheen for carrying out a first-person narrative so strongly, particularly between his scenes with Marlon Brando as they discuss how the horrors of the Vietnam War never stop consuming one's soul. Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, who won an academy award for his work in Apocalypse Now, was paying good attention to the dialogue, choosing to shroud Brando in darkness for most of his screen time. The effect is spellbinding.\nAs a hardcore liberal, I can always back up a message that condemns warfare of any level. That does not mean I cannot appreciate subtlety. In fact, what is most remarkable about the movie is that the idea of war being bad is absent. The message, \"Stop the war,\" is left only to the audience to interpret. Sure, there is that aforementioned dialogue on the horrors, but that is war, right? Coppola carefully designed and arranged the light and dark moments for film buffs of any political stance to appreciate. More than anything, Apocalypse Now stands far above other war films by skipping any underlying opinion on war.",

            "content": "Iâ(TM)ve always heard about this movie since it was re-released in 2001 as an extended version. But Iâ(TM)ve only seen the theatrical version of Director Francis Ford Coppolaâ(TM)s 1979 Vietnam War epic drama APOCALYPSE NOW. Written by Coppola and John Milius (director of CONAN THE BARBARIAN and RED DAWN), the film tells the story of two US Army Special Operations officers, one of whom, MACV-SOG Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Martin Sheen â\"Gettysburg, TVâ(TM)s âThe West Wingâ, The Departed), is sent along with an eclectic group of Navy PBRs to the jungles of Cambodia to assassinate the other officer, the rogue and presumably insane Special Forces Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando â\" The Godfather, A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront). The film also stars Frederic Forrest (Falling Down) as the tightly-wound New Orleans native Engineman 3rd class Jay âChefâ Hicks, Sam Bottoms (The Outlaw Josey Wales) as drugged up California native Gunnerâ(TM)s Mate 3rd Class and former professional surfer Lance B. Johnson, Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix), who was fourteen years old and lied about his age when he got cast to play the cocky seventeen year old Bronx, NY native Gunnerâ(TM)s Mate 1st Class Tyrone âMr. Cleanâ Miller, Albert Hall (Rookie of the Year) as Chief Quartermaster George Phillips, Robert Duvall (The Godfather) as 1st Squadron, 9th Air Cavalry Regiment commander and surfing fanatic Lt. Colonel William âBillâ Kilgore, Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider) as a crazed American photojournalist, G.D. Spradlin (The Godfather Part II) as Military Intelligence Lt. General Corman, Scott Glenn (Backdraft) as Captain Richard M. Colby, with R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket) as a helicopter pilot, and Harrison Ford (the Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogies) as Military Intelligence officer Colonel Lucas. Iâ(TM)ve seen other Vietnam War films such as PLATOON and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, but thought this film was both very visual and made me feel like I was at that war. The scene I really enjoyed was when we see both Sheen and Brandoâ(TM)s characters for the first time as Brando says âYouâ(TM)re neither. Youâ(TM)re an errand boy, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a billâ. Out of all the actors, I really enjoyed both Hopper and Brandoâ(TM)s performances. I also thought that Brando played a really scary looking character, especially when he looks at Sheen as heâ(TM)s wearing war paint all over his face and head. Iâ(TM)m used to seeing Laurence Fishburne in movies, such as THE MATRIX, RED HEAT, and ARMORED, but I thought it was so weird seeing him in this film as a young 14 year old kid. Harvey Keitel was originally to be played as Willard, but was replaced by Sheen after the first two weeks of shooting. The shooting of this film in the Philippines was a nightmare. It was originally to be a six week shoot, but ended up for 16 month from March 1976 to June 1977. Why? Because there were problems such as Brando showing up to the set overweight, Sheen having a heart attack and struggled for a quarter of a mile to reach help, and the 1976 Typhoon Olga destroying several sets that caused filming to be delayed for several months. For the next two years, the release date for the film was delayed several times, till it was finally released on August 15th, 1979. Performing well at the box office with $322,489 the first five days, then later grossed over grossed over $78 million domestically with a worldwide total of approximately $150 million. To end this review, I thought APOCALYPSE NOW was an entertaining and well-crafted film that Francis Ford Coppola made. And if you havenâ(TM)t seen it, then I recommend for you.",

            "content": "\"This war's gonna end someday.\"\n\nWell, Apocalypse Now, along with 1971's Get Carter, was one of the two very disturbing films I have seen in the past few weeks. As much as I am very worn out from witnessing the haunting and thought- provoking themes these films present, I very much would like to write a full review. Now, before Apocalypse Now, I heard of Heart of Darkness, a documentary about the very large and unfortunately very eventful development and filming of Apocalypse Now which conveyed the very risks and measures and challenges that Francis Ford Coppola ever so strongly handled, despite the fact the mere making of the film almost drove him insane. Challenges such as filming delays, Martin Sheen's heart problems, and most infamously, Marlon Brando's very gigantic change in weight. Don't take this the wrong way, because I loved the other performances, especially by Robert Duvall, but the unconventionally peculiar, or more specifically, idiosyncratic Colonel Kurtz lived and breathed by Marlon Brando was quite simply what carried the film after it was taken off the shoulders of the film's equally shining lead, who was portrayed by Martin Sheen. Another thing that I'd like to point out is the recurring theme that reveals the very obvious truth about war that it simply spares no one. It chooses no one. Yes, people might complain about the disturbing scenes presented in the film. But it's just like Quentin Tarantino and his ear-cutting scene in Reservoir Dogs. Yes, the scenes might be very haunting and disturbing, but it only shows how mad times really were back then during those times. It was when killing a man, taking away his life, taking everything he is and all he's ever gonna be, was just another day in the field. It wasn't met with punishment. It wasn't met with death. It was met with reward and praise. Francis Ford Coppola, like Mr. Tarantino, chose and wanted the scene to be disturbing. Both of them wanted to affect the audience. Not in a way where the people watching will be left too traumatized, but in a way where despite all the blood and gore and carnage, it isn't mindless. It isn't gratuitous. The grim and horror of the scene is presented, but one has to appreciate the power and strength also presented in these scenes (The harrowing and dark violence in the ear-cutting scene is in this film, but unlike the violence in Apocalypse Now, the violence of Mr. Tarantino is purely for grit and style) so instead of being too disturbed, the scene would bring out emotion and would leave you gasping in awe about how unflinchingly horrifying yet undeniably amazing these kind of scenes really are. It's just an answer to people who thought that Django Unchained was too graphic about how badly black slaves were treated or thought JFK was too blatant and straightforward on their very controversial conspiracy theories about the title character's assassination. That was just how it was. The gist of those movies weren't to make people uncomfortable and uneasy. They were to retell. Similarly, Apocalypse Now isn't an exploit. It's a reminder. This is also the reason why I'd understand, whether he/she loves this film or not, someone wouldn't really want to see it again. Other films that contain scenes that also greatly capture the essence of mixing graphic sex/violence/nudity with thought-provoking and raw content are American History X, 2004's Crash, or The Deer Hunter (And only the latter is about war.) Now, I've never met a soldier in my life. I've never been associated with one. I've never known a guy who's even remotely associated with a soldier. I never touched a gun. I never got into a physical fight. The closest I've ever gotten to ultraviolence was playing video games and watching A Clockwork Orange. I guess I could add watching this film to the list. But anyway, what I'm saying is that I can't really relate to this film in any way, but nevertheless, I loved it. But unlike Quentin Tarantino, Coppola didn't one or two of his scenes to be perfectly unsettling and thought-provoking. He wanted the whole film to be. Apocalypse Now is one whole ear-cutting scene. But not in a bad way, like saying the film is too painful to bear. Anyway, back to Colonel Kurtz. I have to admit he's pretty clever, but no matter how intelligent or brilliant his paper calls him out to be, he is a lunatic. Kurtz was insane. But not Travis Bickle-insane. Sure, Bickle is a ticking time bomb, ready to explode any second. He was a sociopathic animal, and if a real rain ever came like he wished, he unfortunately, would be washed away along with the rest of the scum. But at least for the time being, Travis seemed to be able to lead a good life and he seemed to be capable of living in a totally normal society. But Kurtz? No. No, Kurtz had to build his own society. He had formed himself an army of darkness and made everyone around him his own personal stuff while for Kurtz, everything was just rainbows and chocolates. I'd never think, no matter how deeply on edge he was from fighting in the war, that Capt. Willard would ever sink down to Kurtz's level. He was recruited as a competent, level-headed, and reluctant albeit obedient soldier. He had a crew. He made friends. But most of all, he was brave. Brave enough for his country. *SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* \"The horror, the horror.\" For me, the horror was seeing the final shots of the films, which were the perfect haunting example of a man become exactly like the man he'd been trying to kill. But we all had to know that Willard was a normal guy. He couldn't experience so much without something cracking. Let's go through what experienced, shall we? Lawrence Fishbourne, in a very early role, is a young gunner in Willard's crew. He wants to reunite with his family, and while traveling by boat with the crew, receives a message on tape from his mother. He plays it, when suddenly the boat is ambushed and Fishbourne's soldier is shot dead. The worst part was that the tape wasn't even finished playing. After his death, the crew's boat captain, who didn't even seem to like Willard, is driven into an angry rampage due to the death of his crew mate, and deems his death as Willard's fault. Boat Capt. tries to attacked Willard, but is shot in the back with an arrow by the guys who ambushed the crew. Even in his dying moments, the boat captain still tries to avenge Fishbourne. Willard had no choice but to finish him off. Then another one of his crew, an aspiring chef, and most of all, Willard's friend, is left to wait at the boat while Willard is taken to Kurtz. The next thing Willard knows, Chef's bloody and recently disembodied head, eternally staring into nothingness, is thrown onto his lap. So overall, Willard, an officially former sane person, grabs a machete and slashes and stabs Kurtz's ass to death with it. Nothing worse than seeing someone stoop down to his enemy's level. That's why I liked Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy so much instead of Burton's. It's because Batman doesn't kill and sink down to his enemies' level. Anyway, overall, this film is spectacular not only because it takes a normally disturbing scene and makes it more, but also because even now when every story and every genre is worn out, and people who weren't alive back then in 1979, people like myself, wouldn't really find Apocalypse Now's story original, the film conveys a daunting message against the backdrop of a depressing mood and a eery war-themed background, and executes with too much unconventional style and fantastic performances for it to be ignored.",

Today's generations should watch this film and get an understanding of what life was like in these times, and how much we might have in common with past generations, especially those who have seen combat. When I think of this movie, the one thing that resonates with me is when Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) says that what he needed to fight his war was men with morals who were not afraid to kill without mercy. That, in particular, has stuck with me because it describes the very best, and worst, of human nature. This is truly a fantastic film.",

Have you ever had one of those dreams where you are attacked by a grizzly bear while on an African safari so you swim to the surface and turn into a pterodactyl in order to fly away to safety?  Yeah, Apocalypse Now is a little bit like that.  It starts off as a Vietnam War movie, and looks great all the way to the end, but the story - the story - it is insane!  The film would have been more aptly titled, \"Captain Benjamin Willard's Expedition to the Temple of Nonsense\".\n\nThe further up the river they get, the more drugged out the movie starts to feel, which at first I thought was going to be a reference to post-traumatic stress...nope, just good old fashion lunacy.  It starts with the impossible behavior of Lt. Col. Kilgore, but I just wrote that off as a strange & misplaced attempt at humor, but then we get to the bridge battle and the movie begins to become mind-numbingly odd.  I can't even describe how this movie descends swirling around the toilet bowl of absurdity before it flushes down to the sewer of utter madness.  My head began to hurt the last half an hour; it was so supremely bizarre.  It is hard to imagine how it gradually changes gears from a normal enough war movie to a drugged out nonsensical waste of time in the jungle!  I'm not being facetious, I am serious, literally, my head actually hurts from my exercise in futility in trying to weave together this mess of loose ends.\n\nFilm critics can be such sheep.  Sure you can be black sheep if you want, but you are every bit as much cowardly conformists as your more numerous mainstream counterparts; mindless cowardly conformity to a subgroup is still conformity.  To argue this film a masterpiece requires a desperate search for figurative meaning, a smothering of common sense, and is a sad attempt at acceptance into a group of pseudo-intellectuals.  This films reputation is because of who made it, when he made it, and groupthink...period.  Colonel Kurtz was not some great free thinker (there have been many about whom films have been and could be made), nor was anyone in his outrageously improbable personality cult.  How did he persuade this brutally savage & primitive people to exalt him by the way?  How did he even communicate with them?  I suppose he learned their language...right.  \n\nThis is not a matter of taste. This movie is simply terrible, the story is crazily incongruent, and anyone with eyes to see and a mind to think will agree.  The film itself is very well made, but that is not even close to enough to make the movie as a whole worthwhile.  If you want a film about humanity's imperfections, if you want a film about the horrors, consequences, or idiocy of war, if you want a film about thinking for yourself and doing your own thing, if you want a film about political hypocrisy - whatever you want, please, just do yourself a favor and watch another movie.  In fact, Apocalypse Now is so long you can watch two.",

In displaying the mesmerising madness of his character, Kurtz's dialogue is simultaneously meaningful and meaningless. Throughout the film, Sheen's narration enhances the atmosphere. The use of music is stunning- particularly that of The Doors at the beginning and the end. Overall, it is a brilliant, insightful commentary on the effect of war on man.",

Although the Redux version is fairly straight forward for the majority of its 3+ hour running time, it descends into a hellish, hallucinatory final act which truly makes one question the reality of the situation. Coppola matched the scale of his Godfather films with this fellow New Hollywood film, and he exercises a staunch control of the material, which never strays far from his original purpose. The film in any version never loses sight of its unconventional portrayal of the climate of the time, and it's all the better for it.",

They meet up with a hardened napalm-loving colonel (Robert Duvall), watch a USO show, and witness as well as take part in senseless killing. With the crew whittled down, Willard finally reaches the outpost of Kurtz, only to witness the horror that lies there. After waiting so long to complete his mission, Willard feels conflicted about it upon seeing Kurtz. This is one of Francis Ford Coppola's most famous films and it truly was a labor of love since it took a long time to complete. Although their parts may seem minimal, Brando, Duvall, Dennis Hopper, and even Harrison Ford contribute.

            "content": "This is the greatest war film of all time, in terms of symbolism, drama, and the heat of the moment in every scene.  A fantastic movie that starts off really good and is epic at the end.  It is intense, artistic, weird, and creative.  It is a total masterpiece of filmmaking and directing by Francis Ford Coppola.  It is a hard film to direct and that is why it is such a masterpiece.  It is a difficult one to act in too.  Too make a war film like this during that time would have been one really difficult thing to do, and only a genius directors could do it right.  If you didn't think Francis For Coppola was a genius after seeing Godfather's one and two, you will after this.\n\nThis was 31.5 million dollars spent beautifully.  That was why it was so well done, because there was a perfect amount of money spent in all categories, such as the cast, the effects, and the sets used.  The cast had three really great actors in it.  Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, and Marlon Brando were the really great stars in this.  Francis Ford Coppola did The Godfather (1972) with both Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall, and it was magnificent.  Those three do really well together.  Martin Sheen was perfect in the film too.  He had the right amount of intensity in him, and seriousness.\n\nNot only did Francis Ford Coppola select a perfect cast, use the budget perfectly, but he had a perfect use of symbolism too.  Something that gets said in the film is this is where it ends.  Well certain things like that get said.  The river is a symbol of that.  The river symbolizes is this the end of the river for you, or are you going to keep going.  The Doors song \"The End\" gets played a lot to add on to the theme that this is the end.  Apocalypse Now means the world is going to end now, but in this film the title means end of his life.\n\nThis and Saving Private Ryan are the two greatest war films of all time in my opinion.  Saving Private Ryan is greater in terms of it being realistic.  This film is much more dark and suspenseful.  Saving Private Ryan I could tell for the most part what the ending would probably be like.  This film I could tell, but I thought it had a much more intense ending in terms of just darkness.  Saving Private Ryan's battle scenes are more intense then any scene in this film, but they don't have the slow dramatic intensity that Apocalypse Now has.  It is hard to explain, and I think people would think I am crazy for thinking that Apocalypse Now is more intense then Saving Private Ryan, but I have more reason to explain.  Saving Private Ryan is a different kind of intensity.  Saving Private Ryan is more of you are gritting your teeth, and your fists are clenched type of intensity.  Apocalypse Now is more of a on the edge of your seat suspense type intensity.  They are both phenomenal movies, but for some reason I think I like this one a little bit better.\n\nBenjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) just got out of a battle.  When he was in he wanted out, and now that he is out he just wants to be in another battle.  His wife left him, and now he knows that the army is his life.  He knows now that he loves war, and he wants to be there for the rest of his life.  Another mission comes to him immediately.  The mission is to find and kill Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando).  Kurtz has gone insane and is living in the middle of the jungle.  \"Every man has got a breaking point. You and I have one.  Colonel Kurtz has reached his.\"  That is what Willard is told when he was given the mission.  Kurtz is still giving orders and controlling troops, and he is not in the right state of mind at all.  That is why he most be killed.  Willard goes on a boat with several young guys to go out and find him.  Several of them die along the way.  When they find Kurtz he is in this weird place and he has heads all around the place as decorations.  Though it is a long time before Marlon Brando gets put on screen he is absolutely phenomenal.  The film has one of the greatest ending scenes that is dark, intense, and just stunning.  There is no war film like it, and there is no ending like the one in Apocalypse Now.\n\nMy favorite war film, and one of my rare films that I rated a 10/10.  Francis Ford Coppola is one of the greatest directors of all time, and he proves it with this film.",

Martin Sheen is sent to Cambodia to exterminate one of the most decorated soldiers in the war. But his journey, along with the destination, gives the audience some of the most haunting and greatest scenes ever filmed. Truly magnificent photography by victorious Storaro, and searing performances all around. Cinematography and striking Sound Won deserved Oscars.",

            "content": "I watched this movie time and time again in my younger days. I remember watching it in the dark as I was drifting off to sleep (on my big tv with the sound wafting clearly from my stereo that I was struggling to pay off) and jumped on one occasion as I thought I was going to fall out of the helicopter. \n\nThe shots are still what I find most appealing and amazing. The helicopters coming over the tree tops, the Napalm, the palm trees, the flairs, the explosions and the fan. I think the scene in the beginning , where the fan spins to the sound of the helicopter is amazing. Such a small thing, just editing really. But it always seems so clever to me.\n\nThere are many memorable lines in the movie such as; \"Charlie don't surf!\" Or \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\". The acting is also something you'll remember, it's as wild as it comes. Sheen, Brando and Hopper giving out of control performances like nothing you've ever seen. You are not watching a man who is acting out a breakdown on screen. You are watching a man breaking down on screen, filmed as it happens. In some cases (Sheen) literally.\nThe first time I saw this film I found the sacrificial killing of the Caribou awful. It was shocking as you are watching a live animal being hacked apart. I didn't expect to see it like that. After watching Hearts of Darkness: A Film Makers Apocalypse (a documentary about the making of the film) my mind was rested some what. Its not nice to see but I do feel I understand the reason it's there. The intertwining sequence between the sacrificial cow and Colonel Kurtz, the last major shocking blow/ knock out punch before the end of the movie and Brando's final words - \"The horror ... the horror\". \nFor me it leaves me cold and bitter. I am sure there are more than a few people that feel that way about the war itself. \n\nThe whole movie is a representation of the Vietnam war for me; confused, crazy, shocking and lost. You finish watching the movie and wonder just what you have witnessed. It seems a whole mix and match of ideas, beliefs and approximations. There is no explanation, just a cross section of something you cannot fully understand - like Vietnam. One thing is for sure, it is like no other movie you've seen before. \n\nI like Apocalypse now because it's film making on a grand scale, because of the amazing shots, because it's wild, memorable, intense and powerful. I would have loved to experience this for the first time in a cinema.",
