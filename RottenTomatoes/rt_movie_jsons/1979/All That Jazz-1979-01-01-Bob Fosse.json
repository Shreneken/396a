    "summary": "When he is not planning for his upcoming stage musical or working on his Hollywood film, choreographer/director Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is popping pills and sleeping with a seemingly endless line of women. The physical and mental stress begins to take a toll on the ragged perfectionist. Soon, he must decide whether or not his non-stop work schedule and hedonistic lifestyle are worth risking his life. The film is a semi-autobiographical tale written and directed by the legendary Bob Fosse.",

            "content": "By this point, forty-odd years after its release, most people know how this movie ends. I too was familiar with the infamous ending scene to this movie and had seen it out of context and found it confusing and ridiculous.\n\nThat was before I sat down and actually watched All That Jazz. By the time that ending rolls around after watching the movie proper, I was completely on board, to the point where I didn't want that final song to end. \n\nThis movie stuck with me for days after my virgin watch. It's rare for a movie to so effectively blend the glitz, glamor, and showmanship of classic vaudeville Broadway with the deep, horrifying darkness that all of us carry, knowing death is waiting for us. Maybe we are waiting for it too, and constantly trying to stop ourselves from accepting the embrace of that beautiful, ethereal woman. \n\nThe cinematography in this movie deserves special recognition, between the soft focus used expertly for scenes with Angelique, the use of mirrors, the surreal and nightmarish sets. Repeated shots give different meaning as the movie sweeps us forward with little time to orient ourselves, which fits perfectly in the chaos of the protagonist's life and mind.\n\nI can't give it a perfect score as we all know some of the dance numbers are quite long and hard to get through on repeated watches. Some of the pacing in the first half feels a bit slow as we build towards the chaos and emotion of the second half. Nonetheless, this is an extremely effective and unique movie that has instantly gone onto my list of favorites.",

            "content": "All That Jazz, Chicago and Cabaret are the Holy Trinity of modern musicals. They are Bob Fosse's gift to the world of cinema.  Masterpieces all of them, they represent Fosse at the top of his form; changing the medium; pushing it forward.  This one of the three is the most personal.  It's Fosse's 8 1/2; and just like that movie most of the narrative takes the place of a confessional; him telling his life to his guardian angel.  It's him reflecting on his life in fantastical musical form, and the meaning of life in general; as filtered through his jet-black, begloved, ironical sensibilities; and injected with his trademark sexiness and razzmatazz.  It's an autobiographical docudrama, a self-reflection of all the tragedy, humor and failure in his life; just years before he died.  (Ironically Fosse himself died in 1987; just a few years after this movie came out.  And that's actually became part of the mythology of this iconic movie).  Some people complained this movie was self-indulgent and one-note.  The Fellini movie by comparison was poetic and sweet; it was wistful, with a light touch.  This one can be seen as a heavy handed apologia; one self-indulgent tragic scene after the next.  And yet the musical moments are some of the best movie musical numbers ever; particularly the stunning finale.  It has Ben Vereen and Roy Scheider singing \"Bye Bye Life\"; (a bastardization of the Everly Brothers \"Bye Bye Love).  This number, and so many of the others are so powerful; they wipe most other musicals right off the screen; they are just stunning.  Essential viewing for any fan of movie musicals.  Highly Recommend.",

At times, the film pulses with energy, especially during the opening and closing numbers, but periodically lapses into a pretentious mess, most notably the surreal conversations with Angelique, an angel of death, played by Jessica Lange.

Gone is the monotone and subdued design, replaced with bright lights and high energy, as well as a more overt focus on the crude (often as a coping mechanism). There's still a search for significance and meaning, but it is tinged with much more of the commercial element that resonates with the States; the production backers constantly worrying about the bottom line, etc. Plays its macabre themes of mortality and lack of satisfaction even with success off against the jovial and joyful tones of the cabaret musical, with the added benefit that a superficial glance at the film might draw in viewers that are entirely unprepared for the weight. Extremely tight in its editing and helmed by a solid performance from Scheider, All That Jazz deserves to leave more of a footprint in popular culture than it has as a critical darling alone in recent decades.

Because wrapped inside Giuseppe Rotunno's beautiful cinematography and Fosse's own expertly staged dance numbers is a story about a tremendously unlikable and self-involved man that despite his suicidal unrepentance, still retains the loyalty, love, and admiration of the people that surround him. Curiously devoid of charm, Roy Scheider's flatline portrayal of the fictional Joe Gideon offers audiences little insight into why anyone would find him charismatic, and he seems more exhausted by his own shallow and self-indulgent lifestyle than interested in staying alive. However, the creative talent on display in the film's dazzling set pieces overcome any deficiencies Mr. Scheider may bring to the lead role.",

            "content": "The influence of Federico Fellini's 8\u00bd (1963) is huge as every director from Woody Allen, Stardust Memories (1980), to Rob Marshall, Nine (2009), has seemingly produced their own version of this story. One of the most famous homages to that 1963 classic is All That Jazz which reflects on the difficulties of being a womanizing drug addict who is also a workaholic. My major issue with this film, there are many, is that the art produced by the film's subject is dull and unmemorable which makes his creative process unengaging and leaves the audience feeling shortchanged as all of his whining and self-aggrandizing does not add up to anything. Fans of Fosse should stick to Star 80 (1983) which is possibly the best film he ever directed.\n\nFilm and theater director Joe Gideon, Roy Scheider, balances his professional commits, directing a film similar to Lenny (1974) and choreographing a Chicago-esque musical, and his personal problems, drug addiction and relentless womanizing, as he talks to the angel of death, Jessica Lange. The various women in his life place intense pressure on him as his ex-wife Audrey Paris, Leland Palmer, complains about his infidelity when they were involved, his live in girlfriend Katie Jagger, Ann Reinking, is angered by his philandering and his daughter Michelle, Erzsebet Foldi, would like to him to be a more present father. He is hospitalized when his body finally gives out but he does not attempt to recover and continues drinking, drug taking and womanizing much to the dismay of his doctors and loved ones. After imagining an elaborately choreographed dance number celebrating his impending death he accepts the angel of death and dies.\n\nThe film is advertised as a musical but very few musical numbers actually appear in the film and while I would usually be in favor of this, I don't enjoy most musicals, the scenes of people talking in this film were dreadfully dull. I don't care about our protagonist's obsession with death and his fixation on this issue made the film seem like a second rate version of Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) or The Seventh Seal (1957). I wanted to laugh at all of the self-aware jokes and the digs the film attempts to make at the entertainment industry but all of these ideas had been better explored in other films and I kept thinking of those films while witnessing mediocre versions of these classics. The final dance number did have something to show but the film that came before it meant that waiting for this surrealist show was not worth it.\n\nThe performances were also lacking as while Scheider is decent in the lead role the performers around him seem like amateurs more suited to dancing than acting. This is in part true as he cast many of the women he slept with in real life to play characters based on themselves and they overplay almost everything they have to work with. Reinking is smiley and supportive as his current \u2018girlfriend' but her hurt and pain when she discovers that he has been cheating was not convincing and she maintains a blank expression when not interacting with Scheider. Lange is her usual bland presence as the angel of death as beyond her shiny blonde hair we never understand why she is alluring and her delivery of teasing questions to Scheider make her sound more like a drunk floozy than a seductive angel. The other performers seem irrelevant as the film is really Scheider's show and everybody else falls away as Fosse displays his own self obsession.\n\nIf you want a wonderful musical from the 1970s I would suggest you watch Grease (1978) which could easily be dismissed as populist junk but contains catchy and memorable songs in addition to spirited performances. This is a film that I likely will not remember having watched in a few months time and in comparison to the other Best Picture nominees in 1979 this film appears weak and shallow. Where Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) explores the negative way that divorce effects regular people through smart, sensitive writing and incandescent performances this film presents us with characters who don't seem real in the slightest and who will quickly fade from our memories.

            "content": "All That Jazz is a movie that details the life of a director and choreographer, who was probably inspired by the director, Bob Fosse\u2019s own life. The way they showed the self-destructive habits that rule his life was raw and real. His morning routine brought to mind similar scenes in Requiem for a Dream. It got more aggressive and quick cut as the monotony started to set in, and as everything pushed towards a breaking point. Roy Scheider did a great job in the lead role. He pulled off the obsessive-compulsive nature of the character, and then brought out that fake smile that would fool people into thinking he had it all under control. I tend to enjoy films more when they have a pleasant and likable protagonist, but the entire film was about why his life choices were misguided so I could deal with someone more abrasive in this kind of movie. His introspective conversations with the woman in white were pitch perfect, and served as a great alternative to flat voice-over. The dance numbers in All That Jazz were extremely diverse and each one was breath-taking. It\u2019s impressive to think that glamorous finale was in the same film as the controversial rehearsal for the financiers. Even the songs that did not feature my favorite styles of dance were still noteworthy because they were performed artfully and without any notable flaws. I have to give a lot of credit to all the dancers in the cast. The montage of different numbers as the film approached the finale were so perfectly done and fit the theme of those scenes, it was probably my favorite part of the whole film. Many of the songs were familiar, and I was humming the tunes for hours after it ended. I will say that I felt bad for Erzsebet Foldi who played the daughter in the film. She clearly was hired for her dancing skill which was excellent for her age, but her singing was not good, and stood out from all the others. I would probably say the same about Ann Reinking, but I was accustomed to her scratchy singing voice from Annie. The structure of All That Jazz is occasionally disjointed, and that can be a frustration. However, it all has a dreamlike ethereal quality to it anyways, so the lack of traditional structure somehow made sense to me once I got used to it. I was a bit late to realize the significance of the movie within the movie that the main character was working on. No matter how many times they kept hammering home that same clip it didn\u2019t click that the dialogue was vital to the events that were happening in his life. Once I caught on it was like a revelation, and if I had more time I would have rewound the entire film and started paying closer attention. This fact is one of the primary reasons All That Jazz will be a high priority on my list of re-watches. There were elements of the movie that I didn\u2019t enjoy, even though they were vital to establish the main character\u2019s flaws, but I think if I watch it again I might like it even more when all the pieces fall into place. All That Jazz is not the kind of musical that will top my list of all-time favorites, but I recognize it is an extremely well-made film.",

It's really cool seeing the behind the scenes life of a stage director and how that life is filled with drugs, sex and booze. Kind of like a rock star life. \n\nI love his reaction when Katie says, \"I wish you weren't so generous with your cock\". As he replies, \"Oh\u2026 that's good. I'll have to use that sometime.\" Lmao that was perfect. You know, this movie's got a great sense of humor. I like how as the movie unfolds we get to see more into Joe's life and what makes him tick, along with all his problems. Bro wtf?! Lmao! The fucking doctor who's checking Joe's lungs is smoking a cigarette and coughing even harder than Joe! Lmfao!! Oh this movie's great. I think that's the most sexually ridiculous choreography I've ever seen for an airline commercial. \n\nI feel like this play is killing Joe inside. Yo can feel it during the script reading at the table. I love how they isolate the audio so that it's just his breathing and the sounds he's making. This movie's got an impressive amount of creativity to it that's very unique. Man, the last 25 minutes get pretty fucking crazy and weird. It's almost like experiencing a waking nightmare. It gets pretty damn dark now that Joe is coming to terms with his death. I love the cynical humor all throughout the movie, especially with that final number: \u2018Bye Bye My Life, Goodbye'. That final score was probably my favorite. It's pretty fucked up how selfish Joe was. He didn't really consider his ex-wife, his girlfriend and especially his daughter. I guess in a way he did want to die. \n\nVisually spectacular and beautiful to look at. I think it was filmed in technicolor because the colors really pop and look exquisite, it reminds me of the way Terry Gilliam's \u2018Brazil' looks. Extremely entertaining and deliciously inventive. This movie took me completely by surprise and showed me a side of theater I'd never seen before. This movie is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema. It's more than just a musical/drama, so much more, it's a work of art.",

I'm less interested in what the film has to say about Fosse than in what the fact that he made it has to say about him.

But it is epic and not unrelated to Fellini's 8  1/2, which also took the director's own life as a starting place for an extended fantasy/nightmare.  Roy Scheider is the surprising lead (surprising because he never seemed like a song-and-dance man to me) and he pulls off the chain-smoking, speed-taking, rascally irresponsible promiscuous character just fine, including the singing/dancing finale.  I'll admit that the film drags at times:  I had more than enough of the clips of Cliff Gorman playing Lenny Bruce riffing on Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's stages of death, a scene from the movie (presumably Lenny, 1974) that Gideon/Fosse is editing while also getting a Broadway show together.  Of course, death is a main theme here because Fosse had been warned that is was being hastened by heart problems (presumably brought on by his lifestyle; he eventually died of a heart attack in 1987).  The film maintains a reasonably linear trajectory but bounces in and out of reality, presumably lingering in Gideon/Fosse's thoughts or even perhaps in the immediate anticipated afterlife (where Jessica Lange plays an angel) and dance sequences are liberally spread throughout, culminating in that finale.  You don't feel that the musical setpieces interrupt the story - they _are_ the story - and Fosse had the balls to make them his story.",

All That Jazz is often compared to Fellini's 8 1/2 since it features a self-destructive auteur wading through hallucinatory sequences as his doomed production steadily fails.

It involves more dialogue and the musical numbers don't happen the way most of these films do. They actually serve more of a purpose here and are so well choregraphed. For Roy Scheider I must say this is a serious departure from French Connection and even Jaws this is some remarkable work here. This Semi-biographical film portrays aspects of director/dancer/choregrapher Bob Fosse who also is the director of this film.\n\tLike Fosse the movies main character Joe Gideon is also a director Choregrapher and former dancer. Gideon is looking to direct a worthwhile broadway musical but he is also working on editing a Hollywood film. At the same time he is a heavy drinker and smoker. Gideon experiences many stressful days both in his professional life and personal life. It gets to the point where it where you wonder if he may actually die as he has continuous visions of the angel of death whom he confesses his secrets too.\nThe film as expected has a very jazzy 70's swagger to it. its probably the least musical esque film u'll ever see as it's more a character driven film. It does have the presumed musical numbers but it focuses more on how a director carries on life while dealing with the stress of making a musical production. It also takes time to delve right into the idea of death and kinda brings to life the idea of working one self to death.\nNot to point out the obvious but it seems like every movement and every scene is choreographed like its done in a way like a rehearsal for a play. It's less a movie about being in the moment and more a film about getting each scene right which is quite a different way to direct. The mother daughter musical routine was really cute and shows how the movie also was really fun for the cast. To be honest all the numbers were dope. Overall bob fosse directs in a manner that resembles a stage play director and it really makes him stand out. The editing was excellent and so was the cinematography \nRoy scheider delivers one of the most fascinating performances of his career here. he commands presence in each scene and brings a lot of ego and intrigue to this role of joe Gideon. Gideon is a a guy who is at the top of his game but deep down he struggles with trying to hold everything together. I like how this character study wasn't done overly dramatic but it still got that idea across.\nI think this maybe my favorite musical along with Chicago. Go check this out especially if you love musicals.",

            "content": "I remember looking at the title image for this film and even though it's bright and dazzling, I always felt like there was a hint of despair and sadness behind it, just from the angle of it and that fact that it's surrounded by nothing but darkness, showing the hollow and cruel other side to the business. Coupled with the way the trailer was shot and what the film is actually about, I feel like what I've said about the title fits perfectly, and the fact that it is semi-autobiographical makes it all the more compelling and shocking. Honestly, the only part I feel that makes it 'semi-autobiographical' are the last few seconds. 'All That Jazz' is such a fantastic experience. \n\nThis is a very brave film and it's such a brilliant achievement, it's so unique and once more, Fosse makes something hugely influential, his direction in this film was perfect, he was a man who knew his craft well. It had an awesome introduction and it was so fast, the film feels fully alive and, much like our main character, it just kept going. Like other Fosse works, the film is funny but in a very dark and cynical sense, the characters are very well written and the acting is perfect, Roy Scheider is perfect in the film and fully jumps into character, you truly believe the way his character ends up as the film goes on. Unbelievable to think that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar more times than he was, it's a shame. It is also smartly filmed and excellently edited, even though in just one or two scenes it seemed like it cut so quick that I couldn't understand what a character said or it seemed like they were cut off. Perhaps it was only done these few times on purpose as these were the only times I noticed and the editing did win an Oscar; although, it's funny, when films that have won an Oscar for editing I always seem to find an issue with it somewhere. \n\nJoe mentions Kubrick at one time but this film did have a very Kubrick-esqe feel to it, the use of music playing in the background throughout an entire scene but having it compliment it as opposed to being a song used for a particular moment felt like something from a Kubrick film. There were a couple points in the film where it was a simple lullaby-sounding song and given what Joe was going through at that time, made it extra saddening. We see him editing 'Lenny' throughout the film but I thought it'd be funny if it was Dustin Hoffman we saw in that footage, but it was the original actor who played Lenny in the show but not in the film, but at least everything worked out, sort of. Although, Hoffman didn't mention Roy in his speech, when he was mentioning all the other nominees, oddly; but perhaps he forgot. It felt a little bit forced that the film deals with the death-obsessed character and he just so happened to be editing something where a character kept talking about death and it kept playing whenever something was going wrong. There isn't much you can do about that given the circumstances and what he was editing so it can't be called a coincidence. \n\nI was a little confused at first as one of the 'fake' performances happens at the start for a little bit but nothing like that happened again, but that is until the excellent ending. I'm honestly quite surprised by what happened after an hour in this film, I had no idea what would happen next, the film was already dark but the way this film concludes it's like it was laughing into the abyss, whilst also being hugely sad. Fosse's films usually end rather suddenly but each film seems to end more suddenly than the last, this film slaps you in the fast so fast and then just ends that you are just in total shock by what just happened. \n\nOnce more, Bob Fosse makes a hugely entertaining, deep, funny, cynical and influential film, it's such a shame he only managed to make a handful of films but as this film shows, he was always busy but he did pretty well for himself with his films. This film probably should have won more Oscars, but as should many more films of 1979. 'All That Jazz' is a perfect film, with excellent performances, a perfect tone, excellent musical numbers and just embraces itself so much.",

Structurally, it weaves cleverly in and out of a real world more believable than anything in the last thirty years of screen musicals, and a dream world in which Jessica Lange, as a white-clad symbol of death (a role that, for some reason, she nails, eerily foreshadowing her turn as Tamora in \"Titus\"), asks Joe questions about his life and gradually tries to ferry him across the river of death. But you'd better believe he's not going without... an escalating succession of sequin-infused musical numbers! Ben Vereen stops by for some fun, and, in one of cinema's more memorable moments, there's a scantily-dressed, impeccably choreographed pansexual frolic--Fosse style!

Would it have the same attitude of a vehicle that features Liza Minnelli throatily singing about how much she loves New York, wrapped in a scarlet feather boa and draped in jewels? Or if it would be the kind of thing \"The Band Wagon\" was, only covered in pills and booze? \"All That Jazz\" is thankfully neither.  Directed by legendary choreographer and director Bob Fosse, \"All That Jazz\" is painfully autobiographical; we know it, and so does Fosse.  What we receive is a film that is both robust but recklessly uneven, uncompromising in its vision. \n\tJoe Gideon (Roy Schneider) is aging in his long and paramount career.  As a man in love with the stage and never willing to invent a normal, strictly crowd-pleasing production, he has become exhausted; he works only with frenetic energy and is willing to stay up hours upon hours to perfect his goals.  But all those years of light sleeping, pill-popping, alcohol consuming, womanizing, and smoking have finally caught up with him.  Joe can barely handle it.\n\tIn \"All That Jazz,\" Fosse's ideas are fearless, conveyed only in lightning speed. But only about half of them are thoroughly successful.  His inhibitions are sometimes extremely dynamic, energetic, even touching, while others remain dynamic and energetic but lack that impassioned stinger.  \n\tTake the \"Take Off with Us\" sequence, for example.  The scene sees Gideon previewing his planned dance numbers for his upcoming play to executives who are offensively conservative but scared of being, dare I say it, mean.  The one that comes before \"Take Off with Us\" has all of that theatrical ambition of a \"Fame\" piece; the executives already have the feeling that they're witnessing moments from their newest blockbuster.  But what follows turns the practice studio into a smoking orgy of choreography, dubbed \"Airotica,\" leaving its dancers nearly nude, sweating profusely, and rumbling around in sexual energy.  It's one of the best dance sequences I've ever seen in my life.  It's the pinnacle of the film.  Nothing truly follows it with that same brash excellence.\n\tFosse is a treasure in the world of Broadway and a sporadic genius in the movies.  \"All That Jazz\" is his \"8 1/2,\" both stylistically and in tone.  In style, it's slightly Truffaut, unafraid to jump cut, use \"natural\" music, and combine the contempts of real life and the joys of fantasy.  In tone, it's almost uncomfortable in its self-reflexiveness, as the film mirrors Fosse's life.\n\tYet in the end, \"All That Jazz\" is split down the middle between annoying self-indulgence and filmmaking brilliance.  Fosse's boldness is easy to appreciate, but there are times when the film's in your face style leaves you with a headache rather than a new lease on life.  But Schneider is terrific and so is Fosse's choreography; \"All That Jazz\" is the definition of a mixed bag, if there ever was one.",

            "content": "Review In A Nutshell:\n\nIt's common for filmmakers to find a piece of themselves in the characters they create, but very few capture the biographical sense as intensely and as personally as Bob Fosse's All That Jazz. Biographical films are usually created at a time when the subject or figure that is explored has already firmly established their place in the world and some have already left our world, and the pieces we are left with to remember him/her by is the product or influence that they have left behind. All That Jazz pushes the expectations of the genre by telling a then present recount of his own life; as he was making this, he was going through the same issues as his protagonist, making the film seem much direr than what it actually is.\n\nA sense of risk is felt when watching this particular character, slowly disintegrating through his destructive vices; but the character's flaws are not present for plot purposes, instead it is Fosse's way of crying for help. Though aware of one's own self-destructing nature, he is also aware that he is trapped by his ego, constantly hungry for perfection in order to gain that praise that allows personal satisfaction; as anybody who appreciates fine art, it is difficult to want this man to stop himself from his habits as his drive allows him to create the most beautiful of products, and it would be a shame if the public would not get the chance to see it. The film's dread and melancholy is undercut by the layer of satire that lingers on its surface; it almost seems like Fosse wants us to laugh at him because he himself is also laughing with us. He balances both of these tones wonderfully, not allowing one to dominate the other; depicting its characters and its emotions with a sense of reality.\n\nAll That Jazz's perfection also could have only been possible with Roy Scheider as the leading man, demonstrating a sense of intimacy in the way the character displays emotions, hiding the truth of himself behind his perfectionist persona; but what is most important is that the character feels human, we are watching an individual who has problems and handles them in such a flawed way, which in my opinion is humanistic. Scheider's most impressive moment was at the film's ending, where he hugs his daughter, and he looks into the eyes of his sad ex-wife, displaying tenderness without changing the tone of the scene; it was a moment that happen for only a second, yet it possesses the heaviness of something much longer.\n\nAll That Jazz captures the perfectionism qualities of humans accurately and effectively, never reaching for the melodramatic elements in order to make a sympathetic film. It also acts as a great representation of the darkness that many are not aware of within show business.",

            "content": "\"I know a whoopee spot, where the gin is cold, but the piano's hot; it's just a noisy hall, where there's a nightly brawl, and all that jazz!\" Man, that song is now so deep in my had that I just had to make that reference, even though it's not especially cleverly ironic, considering that this film's title really is a direct reference to that song. That's right; if you're the kind of person who has always wanted them to make some sort of property based on the opening number in a musical, well, congratulations, because this film stands as evidence to your not being the only weirdo to think that. Well, you're probably the only one alive who thinks that, because Bob Fosse is dead, and if he was really as busy as this film says he was, I'm surprised juggling the film \"Lenny\", the musical \"Chicago\", and all sorts of other jazz (Tee-hee) wasn't what killed him. Yeah, this film isn't actually directly about the song \"All That Jazz\", but it was the closest thing we got to an adaptation of Fosse's \"Chicago\" until 2002, and even then, it seems more like a rip-o-I mean, companion piece to Frederico Fellini's \"8 1/2\", because it's yet another pseudo-surrealistic semi-autobiopic about the struggles of being a filmmaker. This film scored the Palm d'Or, so I guess Fosse's playing to the European crowd worked out, but don't go worrying that this film is a dull as \"8 1/2\", because it's got... song and dance numbers (Cue - you guessed it - \"jazz\" hands)! Well, as entertaining and, for that matter, rewarding as this film is in a lot ways, it still has more than a few aspects to challenge your attention.\r\n\r\nTonally uneven, this drama alternates between lively and tongue-in-cheek, maybe even rather blue humor, and heavy, almost existential dramatics which, even by their own right, fail to keep consistent with subtlety. I don't suppose the subtlety lapses are ever all that considerable, but they're decidedly present, found within melodramatics, if not an almost abrasive overemphasis on visuals and set pieces which aim to compliment themes regarding the monotony and stresses of life, and, of course, the consequences of excess in life. This film doesn't seem to be quite as vulgar as they say (Well, why did we have to see the surgery sequence?), but it's still a little obscene, as well as a little tonally abrasive in its betraying the potential sophistication of this character study, leading to an intellectual unevenness to accompany tonal unevenness, and focal unevenness. Between aspects of the lead's love/sex life, family, career and fascination with mortality, this film juggles a lot of branch, and sub-branches to largely be so driven by a single individual, and simply can't keep up with it all, jarring back and forth in an almost exhaustingly convoluted manner whose monotony is exacerbated by other forms of excess. Focal inconsistency derives from, not simply too many segments, but too much focus on each segment, reflecting fat around the edges of storytelling that, with all of the other abrasive aspects, leads to a sense of repetition, if not utter monotony. The film is about as inspired as it is ambitious, and is ultimately rewarding, though not as fulfilling as it could have been, as it's too overblown to keep consistent in tone, focus, pacing and subtlety, and almost too overblown to compel. Of course, the final product manages to engage through and through, or at least entertain thoroughly, partly because of its musical flavor.\r\n\r\nFeaturing anything from Vivaldi masterpieces and an original Ralph Burns bebop score, to delightful mainstream and show tunes, this film's backing soundtrack keeps the musical value of the film pretty sound in between the song and dance numbers, which are underused, but well worth the wait, with that classic Bob Fosse snap, flare and audacity. These musical numbers simply mark heights in a solid style that makes this a fairly glamorous film throughout its course, and supplements an entertainment value which still can't completely carry the engagement value of this promising drama. Convolutedly overblown with branches, this film's story concept is even overambitious, and the missteps in its interpretation betray the potential, but this remains a very worthy plot, which touches upon themes regarding glamor and sleaze of show business, and how it can corrupt a man of vision, lust and pride, if not obsession and excess, broken up by themes on existence and mortality which secure the sophistication of this film's subject matter to back an intriguing plot. There is a lot of potential behind this film, and Robert Alan Aurthur's and Bob Fosse's script stand to fulfill it more thoroughly, but even with its excessiveness, it too endears pretty thoroughly, with sparkling dialogue highlights which reflect a wit whose incorporation into even some of the more blue comedy snap and liven things up, while depth is brought into the storytelling by rich characterization. Most every supporting role is tightly drawn as memorable by its own right, - with the help of across-the-board charismatic performances - as well as complimentary to the depths of the leading Joe Gideon character's story, truly carried by Roy Scheider, who, in one of the defining performances of his career, captures the charisma of a sleazy artist with an impeccable charm, until humanizing the role of a flawed, doomed mortal with powerful emotional layers which range from engrossing to near-penetrating. Scheider is a revelation, but not even he can secure the reward value of this drama, thus, it all falls on Fosse's direction to make or break this film, and considering Fosse's ambition and abilities, he delivers more often than not, with a style that, while often abrasive, colors up brisk momentum and sustains thorough entertainment value which holds your attention, until your investment is secured by thoughtful, maybe even subtly delicate moments of dramatic inspiration. The film is moving when it most needs to be, and a lot of fun the rest of the time, and although it could have been a little more consistent, it compels enough to reward as a lively and intelligent drama.\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain falls, tonal, intellectual and focal inconsistencies reflect an excess that is particularly found within an overdrawn and often repetitious structure which threaten the final product's reward value, firmly secured by the lively soundtrack and musical numbers, intriguing story, clever script, strong performances - the strongest of which being by an outstanding Roy Scheider - and inspired direction which make Bob Fosse's \"All That Jazz\" a thought-provoking, compelling and, of course, fun exploration of the show business and mortality itself.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",

This is a great piece of american late 70's neurosis ( this is seldom done this right) and, obviously, a great dance piece and a perfect exemple of Fosse directorial style, one where the color palette of the day to day is voluntarily drab to  put it in relief with the sparkle of the stage wich is only real life all dressed up.

            "content": "This movie, which won the Palme d'Or in its year at Cannes, is a pretty curious case. Much of 1970s zeitgeist tends to go in one of two directions. On the one hand, there's gritty, unvarnished realism of the sort found in the films The French Connection, Taxi Driver, Saturday Night Fever, All The President's Men, Network, Nashville, and so on. On the other hand, there's a lot of garish, highly artificial kitsch - think of disco, Grease, or many of the TV shows of the era. This movie taps into both of these veins at once in a way I've never really seen before.\n\nThe movie was written, directed, and choreographed by Bob Fosse, the man known for choreographing the play Chicago and making the film Cabaret, among other things, and it's pretty explicitly based on his own life. Roy Scheider plays a successful choreographer with all the typical morally-dissolute-artist problems of alcohol, smoking, drugs, and infidelity. The movie (spoiler alert, kind of) basically just chronicles the events leading up to his death, with lots of flashbacks and musical numbers leading up to it.\n\nScheider's performance is remarkable, and pretty far from what he did in The French Connection and Jaws. Everything about his appearance and mannerisms in the film is carefully thought out, and while I haven't seen much footage of Bob Fosse himself, it seems like Scheider was probably doing a pretty good imitation. Leland Palmer manages to suggest a lot about her character's history with the main character as his ex-wife. Ann Reinking's actual character doesn't get that much development as his girlfriend, but she does have a lot of good dancing numbers. And not that they have huge parts, but both John Lithgow and Wallace Shawn are in this movie!\n\nWhat's so weird about the movie is the simultaneous impulses towards flashy dance numbers, and towards brutally realistic depictions of ill health both physical and mental. The movie smartly integrates all of the musical numbers into the actual story, and the darkness of the underlying subject material often ironizes and subverts the gaudy, yet carefully choreographed, song-and-dance sequences. This is particularly true at the end of the film, when the character fantasizes several huge numbers while never actually leaving his hospital bed. And yet, for all the work the movie does in these respects, it's still kind of hard to get a sense of who this character basically is as a human being or why we should care about his problems. He pretty much seems like just the collection of his behaviors - he takes drugs, smokes, cheats, and choreographs, sure, but who is he really? Because of this failure, I was intellectually interested in what the movie was doing, but never really emotionally invested in it. Fellini's 8 1/2 was a similarly navel-gazing exercise, but that one worked better for me because we got to see Guido as a kid and understand a little bit of who he was. I'd say you check this film out if you're interested in good filmmaking or choreography technique (after all, the movie got 9 Oscar nominations and won 4), or if you're interested in the life of Bob Fosse, but it's not really the sort of movie that bowls you over emotionally with its narrative.",

Ann Reinking, as the new woman, is oh-so-slinky in her dance numbers.\n\nThe conclusion is much too obvious - so many numbers devoted to regret and loss, all with the faux happy Broadway veneer.  It's meant to be ironic, but it becomes self-indulgent at a point.  Scheider also doesn't really get any singing or dancing opportunities.  He nails the drama, but I wish there could have been at one least number in which he wasn't just dancing around somebody or harmonizing with the angel-voiced Ben Vereen.",

The performances are top-rate, the dancing is some of the best I've ever seen (and alone is worth the price of a ticket), but Joe Gideon's death wish is the core of this film, and as compelling as anything I've ever seen on screen.  A classic.  Flat out genius.",

            "content": "Bob Fosse had a restively short career in movies with only five feature films when he died in 1987 from heart attack only 60 years old, but besides the movies he had a pretty busy life as an actor, a dancer a choreographer a theater director. And many people conciser his feature film All That Jazz to be his autobiography, his 8 1/2.\n\nAll That Jazz is the story about acclaimed director and choreographer Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) who's is very busy doing many things at once, like editing his latest film, directing a stage musical, have his weekend with his daughter. Every morning he listening to Vivaldi while taking his daily drugs and says to himself in the mirror \"It's showtime folks\". He's seen smoking cigarettes all the time. Along with all his work this effects his health, but he have no intentions of relaxing in a hospital bed.\n\nAll That Jazz is like Fellini's 8 1/2 a meta film, only this time it's a musical inside Gideon's head. Real life is real life, while on his deathbed he imagine directing a farewell musical to himself. While the death angel Angelique (Jessica Lange) is preparing to take him to heaven. You may think that this might be what Bob Fosse were thinking on his deathbed. Because most of it actually fits right into his own life. Besides these speculations All That Jazz is a joyful musical with a lot of great dancing and singing performances. And Roy Scheider's performance is just his best in his entire career, as the self destructive and charismatic artist that does nothing but thinking art. Thumbs up.",
