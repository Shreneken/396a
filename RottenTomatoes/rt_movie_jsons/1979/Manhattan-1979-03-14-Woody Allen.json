Isaac is dating fresh-faced Tracy (Mariel Hemingway), a high school girl he knows is wrong for him, and begins to wonder if he and brainy writer Mary (Diane Keaton), the mistress of his best friend, Yale (Michael Murphy), might make a better couple.",

Brilliant cinematography thanks to an essential black & white; legendary soundtrack from the very first scene; typical Allen's wit at its finest distilled into a relentless screenplay; morally compelling and romantically universal. This masterpiece speaks to me, and it's hella fascinating to hear what it has to say. I'd watch it all again just to see Tracy paralyzed by her emotions around the end of the movie. We are but hostages of passions.",

            "content": "Allen's Manhattan is a director's lovingly idealized depiction of New York City, with glossy black and white cinematography making the landscape seem polished and ethereal. Towering buildings loom and landmarks stand like vaunted monuments; while the grime can't really be avoided in any depiction of New York ca. 1980, it's downplayed and treated like an oddly cherished part of the city's identity. At one point, we trail along behind a white Mustang as it cruises (alone) near the Hudson, listening in on the conversation between the passengers 30 feet ahead. There's no ambient noise, no traffic, no echoes from ten million other lives. It may not be realistic, but it does certainly look great. \n\nIn this somewhat fictionalized playground of the intelligentsia steps Woody Allen as Isaac Davis, the next name given to the same personality that Allen does in most of classics - fretful, highly educated, verbose, and with a sardonic wit. But that's because his character works so well, and is pretty much endlessly entertaining. Isaac forms the centerpiece of a network of current and former lovers, friends, and colleagues who explore the possibilities of companionship through a series of small-scale encounters and everyday meetings where their sincere discussions are intermixed with heavy doses of humor and sarcasm. The roles are all well-played enough for the film to function as a straight-up comedy, but as the runtime rolls on you begin to see that there is an emotional depth behind it all - nobody is sure of themselves, everyone is making it up as they go along, and the passions are fickle. In this carefully photographed NYC that is beautifully accentuated by the musical talents of George Gershwin, there is a commentary on love and life that will end up hitting surprisingly hard after getting you to let your guard down with some great comedy.\n\nThen you get thrown off by the middle-aged Allen having an openly sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, and you've got to spend the rest of your day muttering about how \"it was a different time,\" so you can keep liking the film. (4/5)",

            "content": "This is another fun romantic comedy by Woody Allen. I have started a long journey of watching all his movies and after 5 of them, I have to say that all were just so delightful to watch. Manhattan was no different: it is fun, it has a good story, great dialogues and beautiful scenes of his beloved Manhattan. Isaac Davis is the main character here (played by Woody, who mastered in playing this similar character over and over), a 40 years old comedy writer that divorced twice and now continues to look for the one relationship¬†of his life.¬†He is currently dating a 17 year old girl who seems to adore him and with whom he seems to feel very safe and just himsef. In this relationship he is the experimented one who is in control of things, he seems to consider this as a temporary thing until he is able to find someone with a proper age. This already hints the feeling that shows up constantly in the movie: people expect to know what they want and feel, who they love more and selfishly chose the best option. Of course, reality is much more complicated than that. Yale, Isaac's close friend, has a marriage of more than a decade but is having his third affair with a woman named Mary. They clearly have strong feelings for each other but also feel a (hypocrite?) guilt for the secret relationship. Isaac meets Mary and, while he is completely annoyed in their first interaction by her intelectual arrogance, it already seems that they will be together at some point. As Yale struggles to find time to be with his mistress, Isaac starts to fill that role and gets involved with Mary as their first encounter suggested. After that, the movie goes on to show us more of the feeling pointed out before as people seem to be so concerned about finding their true love (maybe just true for some time) that hurting the others envolved becomes just an inevitable consequence. The turn of events then is as much unpredictable (at least to me) as the connection between Mary and Isaac was on the first encounter, showing how good directors might even use apparently predictable moments at their favor. Woody's direction in fact is one I am starting to appreciate a lot; I loved the initial scenes of Manhattan while he starts his book (already so indecisive about love and how to describe it), the shots that resembles old silent films are also very interesting and the length of most scenes just blew my mind (it must be a true test for good actors). The movie has a nice and simple story which is told at an amazing rythm that just feels like it is how it was supposed to be (no boring sections at all), there are several funny moments as usual, dialogues are simple but sharpe and entertaining and the beautiful wide shots of Manhattan just complete the whole thing. It might not be the most amazing film but what is not to love?",

No young person wants to watch a movie such as this, and it is particularly galling because color was the standard film choice when the movie was made.  I do not agree with people who say that limiting the shots to black and white somehow \"improve\" the movie.  It may make it easier for the cinematographer and for Allen's storytelling, but it does nothing to illuminate or move along the story.  As a postcard this may work, but as a movie, something fluid and meant to be living, it is limiting and short-sighted.  A very poor choice that cannot be supported rationally.

Isaac (Woody Allen), forty-two and dating a seventeen-year-old definitely didn't age well, even if she (Mariel Hemingway) is the most mature character in the movie. And that might be the biggest issue I had with Manhattan, is that the main cast of characters are largely unlikable in a generally likeable movie. I suppose it's a microcosm of a piece of NYC that still exists today; successful, egotistical, neurotic people making problems for themselves, spending too much on rent, and looking at art. I also could've moved it into the 80s with a better ending. It was so shitty how Isaac treated Tracy, only for the film to want us to want them together in the end. It did give us that gorgeous shot of the Queensboro Bridge, however, even if the bench was never really there.",

            "content": "One of the definitive love letters to New York City this is a film that provided an aspirational vision of adulthood to me at a young age as troubling as that thought was when revisiting the film. Watching the film now I see that it was as brilliant as I thought it was when I first saw it but in different ways as I was now able to look past the glamour of a group of highly intelligent people having conversations about art in a beautiful location to see how lonely all of these people were despite their talents and position in life. I no longer aspire to be divorced and can see that suffering is painful even if you look attractive or have seen several art films. With this ability to look past the surface attractions of the film I could see how it delved into the emotional confusion that people experience when they reach a certain point in their lives and begin to feel lonely.\n\nTelevision writer Isaac Davis, Woody Allen, has left his job ostensibly to write a boom but struggles to formulate ideas. He wallows in the pains he experienced during his relationship with his ex-wife Jill, Meryl Streep, who left him for her lesbian lover and is now writing a tell all book about their marriage. In trying to find himself he has fallen into a relationship with the sexually explorative teenager Tracy, Mariel Hemingway, who he attempts to break up with repeatedly. He eventually leaves her when he falls in love with a woman his own age in the damaged Mary Wilkie, Diane Keaton, who happens to be the former mistress of his married best friend Yale Pollack, Michael Murphy. Davis and Wilkie break up when she returns to Pollack and Davis finds himself alone despite trying to reconcile with Tracy.\n\nFor some this could be considered a better film than Annie Hall (1977), although I still like that film more, as it presents the audience with a tougher ending in that this man never really loved any of the women he was romantically involved with. His relationship with Jill was based on his physical desire for her as he often describes her as attractive while failing to take into account her combative personality or lack of attraction to him. Tracy is a girl that he uses to try to recapture his youth as he remains immature even though he knows about classic films and enjoys wielding a certain power over his inexperienced girlfriend while also having an ‚Äòequal' in terms of maturity in many ways. Finally he falls into a romance with the equally tragic Wilkie who has her heart set on various men who she can not commit to because they either overwhelm her or do not provide her with enough of their time. She is shown to throw herself wholeheartedly into a relationship at it's beginning before backing away for fear of being hurt as all of the rejection she has experienced in previous relationships is recalled. He is not satisfied in his relationships with any of these women and is in a perpetual state of discontent as he wants what the other women can provide when he is with one of his love interests.\n\nWhy is it then that this sad little story of a weak man who does not understand his desires or needs makes New York City look so glorious? Mixed in amongst the depressing story and troubled characters are scenes in which characters visit the landmarks of the city which are seen in glorious black and white and set to a score full of classic songs. The opening and closing montages featuring shots of New York City feel exactly like what one imagines when they think of a stereotypical Woody Allen film and for good reason because few directors have the knowledge of the city that he does. There is one spectacular scene in which Allen and Keaton wander through a museum exhibit set in the solar system and without seeing their faces we understand exactly how each of them feels as they consider starting a relationship before he hesitates. Where the films of other New York directors focus on gangsters or plain middle class families Allen aims for insecure upper class Manhattanites who concern themselves with The Grand Illusion (1937) and Kierkegaard. It is too easy to be taken in by these people as they seem to know everything about culture and speak with authority but underneath all of this Allen tells us that even those living in the greatest city on earth can feel hurt, rejection and even love.",

But what his character does in a film I‚Äôm perfectly willing to judge. I struggled early with Manhattan because statutory rape just isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm capable of chuckling about. This movie asks me to see it as no big deal and a genuine relationship I‚Äôm supposed to enjoy. Not only was the main character actively involved in this inappropriate relationship, everyone around him reacts to it with casual acceptance. When I tried to compartmentalize this one aspect of the film, I still didn‚Äôt find myself laughing much. The humor is mostly built around Woody Allen‚Äôs neurotic personality, and his struggle in romantic relationships. I liked the cast, and the actors do have good comedic timing, but few of the jokes resonated with me enough to get me laughing . I was annoyed by the fact that the characters were pretty despicable, and everyone made the worst decisions. As a result, I didn‚Äôt like anybody in Manhattan at all. Plus Woody Allen made the pretentious decision to film it all in black-and-white for no discernible reason. Manhattan is basically all the things I dislike about other Woody Allen movies all rolled into one. I‚Äôve seen worse comedies, but Manhattan did little to interest me. ",

I loved the movie in its entirety, but as always with me it comes down to the ending being what makes or breaks a movie, and this ending was beautiful.

            "content": "cinegeek.de Ich hatte ganz vergessen, wie wundervoll Woody Allens Manhattan ist und die Balance zwischen Kom√∂die und Romanze mit traumwandlerischer Sicherheit h√§lt! Einige Jahre lang hatte ich Manhattan nicht mehr gesehen und konnte mich nur noch an die witzigsten Einzeiler erinnern und daran, dass die Liebesgeschichte zwischen einem Mann √§lteren Datums und einem Schuldm√§dchen erz√§hlt wird. Manhattan ist aber so viel mehr! Es ist kein Film √ºber die Liebe, es ist ein Film √ºber den Verlust. Der Soundtrack beinhaltet eine Menge romantischer Songs, die im Grunde gar nicht zum Film passen, dessen Protagonist Isaac (Allen) die Liebe gar nicht kennt. Seine Sommerliebe heisst Tracy (Mariel Hemingway, die Nichte des Dichters) und vordergr√ºndig hat sie mit Isaac nichts gemein. Sie hat aber das, was ein Liebhaber so dringend braucht: Die F√§higkeit, ihren Gegen√ºber zu idealisieren. Genau darin besteht der Geburtsfehler dieser Beziehung, weil sich Isaac dessen gar nicht f√ºr w√ºrdig erachtet. Er f√ºhlt sich nicht als etwas Besonderes und sieht f√ºr sich und Tracy keine Zukunft. Angesprochen, auf ihr Vorhaben, in London zu studieren, weiss er nichts Besseres zu antworten, als dass sie ihn als sch√∂ne Erinnerung behalten soll. Die H√§lfte der Zeit, in der sie zusammen sind, versucht Isaac Schluss zu machen - letztg√ºltig mit Erfolg. Er sagt ihr, er w√ºrde eine andere lieben. Hemingway reagiert ganz simpel und herzzerreissend, w√§hrend Isaac wie immer zu viel redet. In dieser Szene wird mir bewusst, dass ich die Figur des Isaac nicht mag. Er hat etwas Grausames an sich. Sp√§ter erz√§hlt er seinem Freund; ''I think I really missed a good bet when I let Tracy go\". Vielleicht hat er das, obwohl er bereits 42 ist und sie erst 17? Darum geht es aber nicht in Manhattan. Der Film handelt vom Zynismus und der Oberfl√§chlichkeit solcher Menschen wie Isaac, die permanent um sich selbst kreisen, w√§hrend sie kultiviertes Zeug quasseln. Die Tr√ºmmer seines Beziehungsleben umfassen ausserdem seine Ex-Frau (Meryl Streep), die nun den gemeinsamen Sohn mit einer anderen Frau gross zieht. W√§hrenddessen schreibt sie einen Bestseller √ºber ihre Ehe mit Isaac, der ernste Zweifel aufwirft, ob ihre neue \"Liebe\" sie genauso obsessiv hassen lassen kann? Dann h√§tten wir Isaacs Freund Yale (Michael Murphy), der seit Jahren verheiratet ist und nun eine Aff√§re mit Mary (Diane Keaton) pflegt. Genau wie Isaac pflegt er die Taktik, aus seiner Beziehung auszubrechen und der Frau anschliessend zu erkl√§ren, er h√§tte es nur zu ihrem Besten getan. So wie Isaac erkl√§rt Yale Mary, sie h√§tten keine Zukunft und √ºbergibt sie an seinen Kumpel: ''You'd be great for her.\" Zwischen Isaac und Mary entsteht eine Liebelei, bis Yale sie wieder zur√ºck fordert und behauptet, er sei zuerst da gewesen. Beide M√§nner sind √ºberfordert im Angesicht echter Gef√ºhle. Manhattan handelt deshalb auch nicht von der gegenw√§rtigen Liebe, sondern der zur√ºckliegenden. Es ist der Moment, wenn wir uns darauf besinnen, was wir gerade zerschlagen haben. Stellen wir uns Manhattan mal als konventionelle \"Romantic Comedy\" vor: Hier w√§ren Yale und Mary das zentrale Paar, Tracy und Isaac ihre besten Freunde. In seiner ganzen Karriere aber hat Woody Allen daran gearbeitet, die Charaktere aus der zweiten Reihe in den Mittelpunkt zu schieben. Isaacs Beziehung zu Mary hat nichts von einer \"RomCom\". Sie ist kompliziert, da Isaac nicht weiss, ob er nun vorw√§rts gehen soll oder nicht? Was f√ºr eine grandiose Idee ist es deshalb, diese Beziehung vor dem Hintergrund Manhattans zu filmen - denn New York liebt Woody Allen nun wirklich! Manhattan heisst der heimliche Hauptdarsteller des Films und in den Strassenschluchten verschwinden die permanent quatschenden Neuroiker. Tats√§chlich gibt es so einige Szenen, in denen jemand redet, den wir gar nicht im Bild erblicken. Isaac und seine Freunde werden auf so aus das reduziert, was sie sind: Nicht so wichtig (anders als sie selbst denken m√∂gen). Die Untermalung mit Gershwins ''Rhapsody in Blue'' schafft es, dass wir uns transzendent f√ºhlen, einfach hochtragend! Dazu die ber√ºhmten Geb√§ude und Orte wie Guggenheim, Elaine's, Zabar's deli... Isaac und Mary sitzen unterhalb der Manhattan Bridge und erleben den Sonnenaufgang. Sie spazieren durch den Central Park. Vermutlich bietet der Film so viele Insider, dass ich als Berliner gar nicht alles verstehen kann! Woody Allen weiss genau, wie einige Songs das Leben der meisten von uns untermalen. F√ºr Isaac hat er den passenden Song ausgesucht: ''But Not for Me''. Unvergesslich, das Finale, als Isaac endlich merkt, mit wem er zusammen sein will und los rennt: ''Strike Up the Band\". All diese Schaupl√§tze in Verbindung mit den Songs h√§tten nicht die Wirkung ohne Gordon Willis' Schwarzweiss-Fotografie, die Manhattan zu einem der sch√∂nsten Filme aller Zeiten macht! Dank Willis wird die Stadt zum Hauptdarsteller. Er erweckt sie zum Leben! Diane Keaton, die bereits ein Star war, bevor sie Woody Allen heiratete, spielt Mary. Sie ist eine Frau, die ihre Intelligenz vor allem dazu nutzt, um ihre Einsamkeit zu unterdr√ºcken. Sie erkl√§rt Yale, dass sie auf keinen Fall eine Ehe brechen m√∂chte, obwohl sie da bereits eine Aff√§re mit ihm hat. Schliesslich ruft sie an einem Sonntagnachmittag Isaac an, weil sie einfach niemanden anderes kennt. Mariel Hemingway erleben wir in ihrer ersten Hauptrolle. Ihr Spiel ist so direkt und unaffektiert, dass es mich tief ger√ºhrt hat. Sie ist gr√∂sser als Isaac, der sie im sozialen Leben immer verstecken m√∂chte. Tracy l√§sst sich aber nicht verheimlichen. Auf die Frage von Mary, was sie so machen w√ºrde, antwortet Tracy: ''I go to high school\". Woody Allen zuletzt, wird oft vorgeworfen, immer dieselbe Rolle zu spielen. Das ist reichlich unfair! Seine Figuren haben mitunter √§hnliche Anlagen, Marotten und eine gewisse Ausdrucksweise - dennoch sind sie nicht eins. Isaac ist ein Mann von grosser Unreife, einer der nicht weiss, was er will. Gegen√ºber Tracy verh√§lt er sich nichts weiter als selbsts√ºchtig und versucht sie sogar, von ihrem London Aufenthalt abzubringen. Beide wissen, dass ihre Zeit vor√ºber ist. Isaac ist unf√§hig, Pl√§ne f√ºr die Zukunft zu schmieden. Er wird einfach nur die Vergangenheit bereuen und versuchen, daran herum zu basteln.",

The entire film is shot in black & white with an abundance of gorgeous photography throughout. Allen plays another New York writer who gets involved with a complicated woman, this time it's after she ends her affair with his best friend. The plot is standard, but this is still a top 10 classic in the Woody cannon.\nAllen & Keaton both do an excellent job, as do Meryl Streep & Mariel Hemingway (who earned an Oscar nod), but all that is distracted by the one major flaw of this otherwise great film. Playing a 42 year old writer dating a 17 year old girl. At the time I'm sure it was odd at the time, but with all the rumors & allegations we have now about his private life, it's kind of unsettling to watch. He calls it out immediately at the beginning of the movie to normalize it but I doubt most people will ever be comfortable with his May/December choice. Of course, he leaves her for a woman that challenges him intellectually but Freud could have a field day with this. I find the ending to be completely false and unrewarding. Considering that this is Allen's least favorite of his own work I'm sure he agrees. \nThis was my favorite Allen movie in college with it's lush city imagery set to the tunes of Gershwin. Absolutely worth watching if you can get past the the ickiness.",

            "content": "Being one of Woody Allen's most critically acclaimed pieces, Manhattan sounded like an intelligent film.\n\n\nFrom a stylish perspective, Manhattan presents a large step out for Woody Allen's tradition of filmmaking. It does not incorporate the same visual or story style to his trademark comic pieces as the film is more comedy-drama yet maintains the same form of atmosphere he establishes in a lot of his films. And in terms of visual style, the cinematography in the film is a lot more atmospheric as it takes on a wider range of angles and incurs more movement and editing than the standard piece. It establishes a feeling of isolation in the atmosphere for viewers and gives them a sense of peeking in on the underside of people's lives. This gives Manhattan a new level of complex depth to it and stronger meaning, and it allows the drama of the film to flourish. And the black and white style of the film gives it an interesting sense of nostalgia. It evokes memories to a much simpler time of cinema, and considering that Manhattan is a rather simple and easy film to watch. The black and white colour palette of the film and lighting evoke a truly classical feel, and that is a great thematic for a Woody Allen film because it makes it all the more meaningful coming from him, as if it is a stylish homage to the films he grew up with. The classical style of the musical score helps to add to this, so Manhattan really is an interesting experience.\nManhattan has the naturally lighthearted feel to it which makes it an easy viewing pleasure. It is not one of Woody Allen's funnier films, but the quality of the comedy in it is fine and it blends with the drama really well. Admittedly it is a rather familiar film in terms of subject matter, but it is still a touching sentiment which is crafter really well with a strong screenplay. The complicated exploration of relationships in Manhattan are an all new angle of exploration for Woody Allen. He has a natural knack for it, and in Manhattan he incorporates it with a new style of filmmaking. It is a very ambitious film, and while it is familiar and relatively slow in pace as well as so realistic in narrative that its drama can only hit a certain level of strength, it is an enjoyable experience. It is a gentle film with a lot of touching plot dynamics to it, although I feel that there is certain predictability to it. It is different to the predictability of a lot of his films as they tend to follow a formula. The thing about Manhattan is that the ending of the film is inevitable, and is somewhat of a letdown. Considering that it is another film about the relationship between characters played by Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, it has an ending to similar to Annie Hall from the preceding year. Both films are good, although Manhattan fails to reach the heights of Annie Hall. It is more stylish, but the fact that the ending is so similar makes it slightly disappointing. Considering the unpredictable nature of the film it would be hard to pick a perfect ending, but I guess I just felt that the one in Manhattan was a letdown which was a bit too similar to Annie Hall. But still, a lot of the other elements that Manhattan borrows from Annie Hall are good.\nAnd thanks to a fine cast, Manhattan remains a solid film on a human level.\nWoody Allen plays out a character less like his stereotypical nebbish than in many of his other films. This time he tones down to Jewish shtick and focuses more on a character who seems naturally like him. His performance is realistic and easily likable which makes the frequently cartoonish character a more humane one. This makes the sympathy in the film a lot stronger as the protagonist is one that audiences will more likely care about. Woody Allen's subtle comic approach to the material and legitimate dramatic work is just grand in Manhattan which makes it one of his greatest leading performances, and his chemistry with every other actor, particularly Diane Keaton, is just wonderful. I was thoroughly impressed with his leading performance in Manhattan as it is very far from indulgent.\nDiane Keaton does a fine job in Manhattan as well. She conveys a great sense of confusion and unpredictability in the role which makes her an intriguing character. Her emotional confusion contributes a great part to the film's exploration of complicated love in relationships, and she pulls it off really easily. Her role is ripe with charisma and finely dramatic without ever descending to melodrama or any sort of cheap comic ploy. She steps away from her iconic Annie Hall role to deliver another excellent performance in a Woody Allen film, so her presence as the leading actress is very welcome.\nMariel Hemingway proves to make herself a likable foil in Manhattan as well. She has a youthful spirit to her and her chemistry with Woody Allen is just great. She is sweet, and in her young age she is easily able to work the best out of Woody Allen's script which is impressive as it is such complex stuff. She makes a name for herself very well in Manhattan, and despite a small period of screen time she is easily memorable.\nMeryl Streep also delivers an early performance in Manhattan where viewers get to see her talents from the same year when she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in Kramer vs. Kramer. Her brief appearance contributes some grand moments to the film, so she is really genial.\n\nSo Manhattan is a rather slow film with a somewhat unsatisfactory  ending and a sense of familiar themes, but it is powerfully stylish, touching and extremely well-acted which makes use of all of Woody Allen's greatest talents.",

After giving it a second look, I now see that I perceived it to be Allen's declaration of his own self-absolution, an embracing of his deeply flawed nature (the 17 year-old love interest specifically), when in actuality it proves to be less of Allen forgiving himself of his sins and more of his own self-flagellation. The perfect rendering of New York, the sentimental and nostalgic social-construct of an idea of New York, is intoxicating and emotionally mirrors his sense of self, the two irreparably fused and co-dependent at the same time. With a bittersweet tone, wealth of critical insight, and impeccable production, \"Manhattan\" is a masterpiece, and rivals only the great \"Annie Hall\" for the title of Allen's most perfect work.",

As for the movie itself, it just seemed like your typical Woody Allen movie, which are usually about relationships between friends and lovers. For 1979, this must have been a unique movie because of its mixture between comedy and serious relationship issues, which we all can relate to, but for this day and age, we have seen this type of film many times before. The relationship between Woody and the young girl was interesting, along with the ex-wife, played by Meryl Streep, whose become a lesbian after having a child with Woody, so there's enough material to keep the movie watchable. Personally, it does go down as some of his best work because he got everything right, but I'm still struggling to get his humour. Watchable!\n\nRound-Up:\nAfter watching some of Woody Allen's later work, I can see why everyone rated his earlier on projects because he had a unique style of directing/writing which is very dry and offensive but in a joking type of way. Half of his jokes in his earlier movies, wouldn't be politically correct for modern times, which is why it's easier to stick with Romantic Comedies. Anyway, Mariel Hemingway put it a emotional and realistic performance, at such a young age, and the rest of the cast made the movie believable interesting.\n\nBudget: $9million\nWorldwide Gross: $40million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about finding love and relationships with close friends. 6/10",

I did feel like it was a good tribute to the city-showcasing all the arts, theatre, architecture, and activity manhattan has to offer. that's mostly all I liked of it other than some occasionally inciteful or funny dialogue.

What truly clicked within me are the few subtle moments filled with Isaac's mumbling and his looking away. Allen said \"he has no problem in meeting women\", yet with some careful thought, we realized he has no problem drawing women's attention, but failed at maintaining them. As in \"Chapter 1\", New York meant beautiful women and street smart guys who know all the angles. Isaac is witty, but not in the same way as the street smart guys. The women Isaac met are all beautiful, yet they're not particularly after Isaac's gifts. With an identity crisis, Isaac holds too strong of an ideal that's most likely developed from unsuccessful attempts with women and life. An intangible ideal is perfect for escaping reality and putting oneself at a higher ground above anything else. Yet Isaac is just an ordinary guy, with a witty sense of humor, chasing after delicately decorated faces, shaped by modern advertising, only with a romantic touch of his own interpretations. Allen Woody was absolutely incredible at interpreting the character that has struck my emotions so hard with the subtle, delicate moments.",

Woody is in love with two women, Diane Keaton and 17 year old Mariel Hemingway. There's two. Then there is Michael Murphy and Diane Keaton, the former being married and Woody's best friend. That's three. The 4th and final is the real Woody Allen's love affair with New York. This is by far the most interesting of all the love stories in this flick. The way the film is shot and written and by using Gershwin tunes as the final brush stroke, Woody paints a picture of his New York. It is very easily, a New York anyone can see themselves living in. While it's not my favorite and I tend to the story is basically the same one he always tells, I've learned to enjoy this film more over the years. Tho I wouldn't mind a Gershwin only audio track on a future release. So I can sit back and pretend I am in the Woody Allen's ideal heaven. New York City.",

It's just, I keep hearing time and again from people who make movies that you can't strain the suspension of disbelief by this wide a margin.  In fact, they've told me that there's no way anyone will buy a romance between a geeky looking guy and the hot supermodel.  Are my film professors just a bunch of jerks who've had their minds twisted by a Hollywood mode of thinking, or is it the sad truth?  Personally, I like to think that any good man fits well with any good woman regardless of what they look like, but, according to film school, most audiences just won't buy it.

Already a modern classic at the time of its release, Manhattan is not only among the best film by Woody Allen but also one of the most poignant looks at the myth of romanticism and the mystery of adult and mature relationships.",

But as there is a movie screen in between him and us we can enjoy his neurotic dialogue and strange tangents and ramblings and ravings and it doesn't matter that the other \"pseudo-intellects\" aren't all that likeable. It is absolute bliss just to watch them all stumbling through their lives talking absolute nonesense. A great cast, all with their little quirks and idiosyncracies. And you can't forget the absolutely beautiful shots of New York, the silhouettes, the streets, the cars, the people, and one of the most iconic and obvious moments; the long shot of Diane Keaton and Woody Allen sitting on a bench just before dawn looking at the lights on Queensboro Bridge.

It's a great story that throws so much in with romance, comedy and even drama. I never really knew much of Woody Allen, all I recognized his voice from was that movie Antz (which looking back isn't that great and had horrible voice acting).

It's a well conceived film, to be sure, with amazing cinematography, a unique story, and a script penned by Woody that is filled with his characteristic wit and dialogue, with good characterizations and an avoidance of clich√©s. \n\nSet against a beautiful backdrop of late 1970s New York, and filmed in black and white, it looks brilliant. The acting is as strong as most Allen pieces, with solid early performances from greats Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. All of this contribute to what feels like a very real story. This is what Allen is perhaps best at, injecting humor and comedy into realistic situations.\n\nMy issue with Manhattan, however, is that the story isn't as involving or as engaging as his other works. It's also not nearly as funny. This is perhaps at least partly due to the dated nature of the film, not aging as well in humor as even some of his earlier works, such as the fantastic Annie Hall. It's enjoyable, but it never reaches the pinnacle of Allen's other work which are often more poignant, hilarious, and engaging.\n\n3.5/5 Stars",
