Call it what you want, I call it one of my favourite movies of all time.\nI adore the creature design from HR Giger it's something else and one of the big reasons why I love this movie. But the soundtrack, the atmosphere and the characters are also so amazing. Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley is just so badass.",

The set design is flawless and just looking at it gives me the chills. Not to mention the eerie soundtrack that adds to the atmospheric tone of the film.

            "content": "a butt-clenching terrifying piece of art.\n\nThe film is about the crew of a commercial spacecraft Nostromo who are woken from their cryo-sleep to investigate a transmission received from a planet. When they get on the planet, they encounter a deadly lifeform which then begins killing them one by one.\n\nRidley Scott's direction for this film is just masterful. The ship feels like a lived-in real-life possible thing. It's not all glossy and clean but rather a bit dirty and something tangible. The crew is also very well realised. Each and everyone had a specific role to fill in the ship and they all work together to make their mission successful.\n\nThis film does a lot of things which I found quite amusing. One of them being not having a clear-cut protagonist for quite some time of the film. It shows you the potential of several characters being the protagonist of the film and then kills them right away until finally dedicating an entire 3rd act to one character itself which if you haven't seen the film, I won't spoil but it was quite the choice for a protagonist because the next film only becomes amazing for the betterment of it.\n\nMy favourite character in the film is that of Ash played by Ian Holm. I have only one thing to say, even though his role was quite limited, that was some of the best \"acting\" I've ever seen in my life. That's it. That's the Ian Holm as Ash compliment. Next up is Sigourney Weaver as Ripley being this badass of a woman who is the person you go to if you want to get shit done. The rest of the cast is also really good because all of them function quite organically into the film having stakes of their own.\n\nNow, talking about the alien design. I love it. It's amazing. Quoting Ian Holm from the film itself,\n\n\"I admire it's purity. A survivor unclouded by conscience, remorse or delusions of morality. The perfect organism.\"\n\nIt's truly amazing what they've achieved with the design here because I guarantee you, you have not seen anything like it before. There's also this deep sense of psychologically disturbing sexual violation feel present in the film. The way this alien creature is born, how it hunts, just about everything reaches that gross parts of our minds where we don't like to go.\n\nAlien is truly an amazing film in it's own genre of isolated-survival horror and surely one of Scott's most influential films. I highly recommend you guys checking it out.",

This kind of idea is what makes Alien so terrifying. The visual effects for this movie are quite fantastic. Especially when audiences get to see the alien. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is beautiful and impressive. Alien is such a wonderful space opera with complexity about the possibilities of what could be out there in space.",

The direction of Ridley Scott is fully precepts and is extremely enjoyable with the presence of a horror / thriller atmosphere. The characters are nice and the cast is memorable. The character of Ash (Ian Holm), although he is a robot, therefore devoid of emotions, has his own charisma and his motive as a \"villain\", if it can be defined as such, is one of the most important and memorable elements of the saga as well as his dialogue in the scene where Ash reveals his plan. Ripley is a character with good characterization as she is one of the most girlpowered women in film history. The Xenomorph cannot be considered a villain because he is an animal and, as Ash says, he has no emotions so he cannot be evil. The plot is not to be underestimated and is deeper than it appears and opens up a lot of connections with Prometheus and other films in the franchise. In conclusion, it is one of the most famous and memorable cult ever made in the history of cinema.",

The very design of the xenomorph, the egg, alien ship, tow ship were out-of-this-world mesmerising. Everything looked so sophisticated and had so much thought behind them, as if every single set pieces were priceless and designed by the best artists there were.\nSigourney Weaver's performance was domineering and revolutionary. Her character was executed and written flawlessly. Her adventure was unforgettable and realised the film's potential thoroughly. Ian Holm portraying Ash was utterly astounding. His dialogue was wise and articulate. He was obviously supposed to be the most intelligent crew member in the ship. And his conflict with Ripley was brilliant and subtle. Their fight about protocols and measures seemed insignificant, but was actually some of the bigger confrontation in the film. Not just the physical fist fights but with verbal, ideological, lawful fight as well. This film showed that not just punching each other in the teeth can be fights, but intelligent and subtle struggle that communicated without violence could be equally lethal too.\nOf course the cat and mice catch with the xenomorph was what the movie was really about and I think it was fine. It was extremely thrilling and scary. I was completely persuaded by the might and dominance of the xenomorph. It was truly the greatest alien of all time.\nThe casual dialogue and daily activities looked unimportant on the surface, but if you look closer, they were some of the most ingenious way to slowly build up the world-view of this film, and the audience was quietly shepherded into the nauseous and suffocating second act and the final surviving battle third act where only the strongest could live. All was done so brilliantly without screaming into your face. That is good filmmaking and that's why Alien is one of my all time favourite. It is a masterpiece and it deserves all the credit it gets.",

It's a creepy, claustrophobic chamber piece that launched Scott and lead Sigourney Weaver into stardom. It's amazing to look at modern horror films and then look back at this film and see the big difference between why this one works so effectively and why most horror gore-fests today don't. The film's key ingredient, like other '70s horror classics 'Jaws' and 'John Carpenter's Halloween', is one word: foreplay. These films earned their frights by slowly building dread and ratcheting up the suspense. We know the thrills will come, and the delicious patience of Scott and the screenplay make them all the more thrilling. Horror films nowadays are on constant climax, getting to the slashing and gashing right away with no build-up or rising tension. This film is also brilliantly lit and shot, adding to the frightening atmosphere even more. Then there's the alien-bursting-out-of-the-stomach scene, which is genuinely chilling and disgusting at the same time. It's a credit to the actors--Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto--that we actually empathize with their plight and their terrifying dilemma. Everything works so well that the ending, despite being satisfying, is somewhat underwhelming considering the greatness that preceded it. But this \"classic\" most certainly has earned that title with verve",

Accompanied by its hauntly romantic score, its elaborate set design, and creative creature FX\u2026 Alien is placed in a distinct category of filmmaking that relied heavier on sound design and in camera effects to thrill audiences. The movie does have a slow and steady pace and I can see where today's movie goers might be bored with its long shots and dedication to convey the scale of its large space environments. With realistic CGI a long way off, the decision to keep the creature hidden for most of the movie allows your imagination to wander to darker and scarier places.

What started life as a spin off script from John Carpenters first movie \"Dark Star\" to the vehicle that saw Ridley Scott and H.R.Giger create an absolute nightmare that would continue to terrify audiences for nearly 5 decades, and in my opinion, it has yet to be bettered. \nIn terms of mood, art direction, imaginative creature design or the sort of claustrophobic terror that the sets, costumes, special effects and soundtrack created, this is technical excellence personified and challenges the preconceptions of the movie goer on many levels, including turning the \"helpless woman verses unstoppable killer\" into one of the most iconic strong female characters we have ever seen.\nStories of audiences moving to the back of the theatre because the stuff on screen was absolutely terrifying are entirely believable.  Giger's work on the alien worlds and creatures coupled with Syd Mead's designs for the human environments, the challenging storytelling where human emotions and compulsions get in the way and lead to the deaths of key characters, and literally creating an entire sub genre of movies in the process.\nAlien changed what we expect from monster movies, and its telling that not only have we never come close to this level of horror again, but in many ways will never experience this level of excellence again.\nSound is important in this movie.  a soundtrack that starts with a building drone noisescape before transforming into a truly Allenesque sounding 7/4 rendition of the Jerry Goldsmith theme, yet almost controversially, his proposed soundtrack wasn't used fully in the theatrical version of this movie which upset Jerry Goldsmith as they instead used music he wrote for Freud without his knowledge.  Facts like this and the use of children in the Space Jockey scene to give the set a grander sense of scale, as well as the stylistic art direction that keeps you on the edge of your seat\nEssentially, Alien accomplishes its goal of portraying a live in, realistic environment 7 crew members (the only survivor being the least known actor) and career defining performances by John Hurt, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kyoto, Victoria Cartwright, Tom Skerret and Sigourney Weaver.  Absolutely Stunning levels of intrigue and the ultimate slow burn plot, which at its heart was \"ten little Indians in space\"\nWatch, consider and be afraid.

The script is also thought-provoking, clever and well written, while the atmosphere is just spellbinding with a perfect mixture of false scares and genuine jolts. The acting is also top notch, Sigourney Weaver is amazing as Ellen Ripley, who is not only one of the most iconic characters in film history but a contender for Weaver's best ever role.

It's actually alright that clothing would be more practical than very fashionably changed in 2122, but the hairstyles won't be very 1979, and neither should computer monitors boxes with glass screens be.

Needless to say, things don't go according to plan.\n\nAlien is an exceptionally well crafted, slow burning sci-fi horror that still manages to shock and keep you on the edge of your seat today. The creature design by Giger is still horrifying and the subtle lore that is established serves to build intrigue without detracting from the main 'problem' the crew are facing. Little did 12 year old me know that these questions would be explored in the later made 'Prometheus'.\n\nNotable mentions should go to Jerry Goldsmiths score who's eerily sweeping horns and strings have become synonymous with getting stalked by a xenomorph and to Ian Holm who turns in an excellent performance playing 'Ash' the ships science officer.\n\nAlthough a slow burner to start (the action doesn't really kick off until the hour mark), the atmosphere and the journey you are taken on is worth the investment.

But there is so much that works great: the sets! the score! the face-hugger! and the fact that Ridley Scott knows how to ramp up tension, and does so relentlessly. It's hard to believe this movie came out only a year or so after the subpar and relatively boring \"Halloween.\"",

I also under that these things feel much different watching them for the first time more than 40 years later. Maybe they would have benefited from some more ominous sound mixing in those parts.

What carries the movie is the suspense. This is a horror movie and a really effective one at that. The fact that the majority of the movie takes place on a spaceship adds this feeling of claustrophobiness and fear as the alien could sneak upon the characters on any moment and the slow pacing and the incredible sound design immerses you into the story, frightened for what the characters will encounter whether it's the discovery of the alien eggs on to the planet or Brett's unfortunate death to the alien as he goes looking for kitty.

            "content": "There are some films that live up to their genres, there are some which define it, and finally there are some which take part in inventing, or \u2018reinventing' it. Most films we see nowadays are either composed of the classic material, but displayed under another filter, or are adaptations and remakes from pieces of literature, or the same classic films. People probably think those films had low level visuals, and boring storytelling, but if you are looking for high-class suspense, unpredictable storyline, AND excellent visuals, \u2018Alien' is the film for you.\n\n\tReleased in 1979, this creature-Horror/Sci-Fi classic was directed by renowned director/producer \u2018Ridley Scott'. Thanks to his unique approach, he created an alien flick which has nothing to do with an alien falling from the sky, or about a lab experiment gone wrong. Instead, this film is completely out of the box. In fact, not even on Earth but on a planet called LV-426. \n\nA spaceship is returning to Earth with seven crew members in hyper sleep. The computer system known as \u2018Mother' (MU-TH-UR) wakes them, and they discover that it had received a distress signal from a nearby. They needed to make some repairs as well, so they land on the planet (LV-426), and investigate the signal, while making some important repairs. They consider the signal to be a warning, and decide to make an exit. Two of the members had gone out to investigate, and had lost connection to the ship, \u2018Nostromo'. They find a place full of some kind of eggs. One of them blooms, and a baby alien, also known as the \u2018Face hugger', attaches to the face of the member, wrecking the helmet, but keeping him alive. It could not be removed by force, for it had highly concentrated acid as blood, which corroded through 3 floors of the ship. Later, the alien detaches itself and dies, but then, during the return journey, the REAL alien, the \u2018Xenomorph' bursts out of the member's chest to later terrorize the remaining members.\n\n\tThe cast includes \u2018Sigourney Weaver', who played the iconic role of \u2018Ellen Ripley', \u2018Yaphet Koko', \u2018Veronica Cartwright', \u2018Ian Holm', \u2018Harry Dean Stanton', and \u2018John Hurt' as the crew members, and \u2018Tom Skerrit' as \u2018Dallas', who was the captain of the ship.\n\n\tWhat makes this film truly legendary is the slow-building suspense and thrills, which will surely keep you at the edge of your seat throughout the runtime.  The movie has some very iconic scenes, and the most memorable and famous one, is the \u2018Chestburster', scene where the alien bursts out of one of the members' chest for the first time. No one had seen the realistic dark blood and promising visuals before. Also it meant more than just a kill. I'll leave that for you to discover. There are several reasons why \u2018Alien' is one of the best out there. It took a lot of time to even design the Xenomorph, and the details of it; again, I'll leave you to identify yourself. You would probably have heard them before. \n\n\tThere are clearly problems faced by critics to identify a flaw in this film, but for some people, it might be a little too slow, and if you have a mind like that, you will not be able to enjoy the thrills it gives, and the slow-building tension that grasps you tight at different stages of the film. For some, the Xenomorph might be too over-powered, or even too over-imagined, but again, this makes it almost inevitable against normal humans (if you understand the symbolism shown here), and hence makes it hard to beat, increasing the tension. Otherwise, the story gets too predictable. But this also proves that this film is not for 1% of the world's population. The violence, sound effects and the Xenomorph itself is a very scary sight, however, the movie uses much more than cheap jump-scares to make it scary. \n\n\tAccording to majority of film critics and audiences, including myself, this film has been classified in the top ten best horror science fiction films ever made, and is definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "\"In space, no one can hear you scream\" \u2013 a memorable tagline for one of the greatest and influential films of all time. Successful at the box office and earning rapturous reviews from critics across the board. The film had gone on to influence future filmmakers and set the benchmark high for the modern blend of Science-Fiction and Horror genre. Establishing also upcoming director Ridley Scott as a talent to be reckoned with, along with introducing the world to Sigourney Weaver, who created one of cinema's most beloved and embraced lead heroines with Ellen Ripley. \n\nThe story centres around a space crew who uncover an \"alien\" of hostile intentions, against which all them must fight to survive within their spaceship. The film has gone on to be replicated in unofficial instalments and spawn several follow-ups and spin-offs in its wake \u2013 enduring a long-lasting - legacy. The film has clearly lost none of what made the movie great, to begin with, and remains a definite favourite of mine. \n\nThe basic premise is that the crew of a cargo spaceship, The Nostromo, all waken from a deep sleep by the company they work for to investigate a signal that may uncover new life. Reluctantly they trace the signal and arrive on a desolate and barren planet with only a strangely built spaceship left in the dust. The message seems to originate from inside its walls, containing chambers of symbolic alien designs. Eggs are found inside by one of the crew members Kane played by John Hurt, and one suddenly hatches, with the organism or inside sprouting and latching on to his face. After it detaches off Kane and dies, everything seems hunky-dory at first, until a more significant threat emerges. A newly born alien, with acid for blood, grows bigger and attacks the crew one by one. Ripley must then lead the remaining team to survive and confront the hostile creature once and for all.\n\nThe film truly has the backing of some really talented crew behind Scott's vision. H.R. Giger, the production designer, really gives the design of the alien and planet its own identity and creatively makes them all look grim and dark. But Dan O'Bannon, the scriptwriter, in contrast with the design, writes the cast as likeable and relatable; you really want these people to make it even when the odds may be against them. The character of Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver gives the role gravitas and projects a compelling lead character who is reliable, robust and has a no-nonsense attitude. Evident still when she has to lead an unnerved crew herself against the alien. It's the chemistry overall of the team that works, and the filmmakers remember why that is important. To have characters that you can support with their situation and is balanced out with a destructive threat that is no-holds-barred frightening.\n\nNot just how the cast and design are constructed expertly but also how the alien appears on-screen is brilliantly handled as well. Scott deploys the Spielberg method that he used with the shark in Jaws; by not showing too much of the monster on screen, the fear factor rises and raises the bar in suspension. This approach is used effectively in Alien \u2013 the less we see, the more frightened we become. The late John Hurt, in particular, is brilliantly memorable in a scene that I won't spoil, for those who haven't seen the film, but is genuinely shocking and ground-breaking. All these ingredients mark a genuinely fantastic piece of cinema that set the standard for modern horror and would prompt much analogy and study of undercurrent themes that resonate within the film. Even when the basic story structure is essentially a survival genre story. Much loved and seen over and over, Ridley Scott and Co. prove that Science-Fiction films aren't only masterful by just making them about the vast, full world of space. That merely using terror and ingenuity within ship decks can work cinematically and create one heck of a damn good scary flick!",

            "content": "A horrifyingly isolating experience in space!\n\nRidley Scott's science-fiction horror film Alien (1979) captures the rational fear of being stranded in space with a killer alien species on board that adapts to its environment. RIdley Scott's masterful direction makes Alien's sci-fi adventure a harrowing experience of penetrating terror. He offsets quiet stillness from eerie spaceship quarters and new planet exploration with pulsing beeps, blaring sirens, spraying steam, wet surroundings, and screams of horror. Scott directed the perfect horror film in space with Alien. \n\nFirst of all, I particularly appreciate his heavy use of fog, mist, and steam for a haunting aura of intriguing mystique. Everything is nerve wracking until the suspense hits with a roar from the alien. Scott's use of practical effects is groundbreaking with real models for ships and paintings in backgrounds as well as Ian Whittaker's real sets for a grounded feel for all his dread-inducing, spatial fear-mongering. Michael Seymour's production design is creepy for the Nostromo too. Ridley Scott could not have directed a better picture than his truly fearsome sci-fi horror epic Alien.\n\nDan O'Bannon's story concept for Alien alongside his script with Ronald Shusett is amazing. You can tell they did scientific research into space protocol, extraterrestrial encounter procedure, biological chemistry, and who knows what else. The writing is mature and succinct as they do not waste a minute of Alien's theatrical 117 minute run-time. Terry Rawlings and Peter Weatherley's editing keeps Alien to a slow burn pace, cleverly building up tension with a growing feeling of paranoia. They only cut when needed instead of rapid fire jump cuts to elicit a startling sensation. Rather, they opt for absolute terror within the viewer's mind by allowing cinematographer Derek Vanlint's long panning shots to just continue on around The Nostromo. You become fearful of what lurks around each corner.\n\nFurthermore, H.R. Giger's classic phallic designs for the alien itself as well as various art throughout Alien is brilliant. His style is Gothic, dark, and bleak with greys and blacks covering everything in a depressing industrial shroud aboard the spaceship Nostromo. Giger's designs are iconic for a reason as they're still scary and original like only a master painter could have come up with in the first place. H.R. Giger and Carlo Rambaldi's Alien costume is frightening with the all black design dripping with liquid and teeth. He contributes greatly to Scott's numbing atmosphere of intense noise and misty visuals.\n\nSignourney Weaver is wonderfully precise, completely commanding, and utterly cool as Lieutenant Ellen Louise Ripley in Alien. If only people would listen to women, maybe everyone wouldn't die. She's astute as Ripley with an air of gravitas to her ethical words. Similarly, my favorite performance was from the shy and sweet Veronica Cartwright as the utterly terrified and frantic Joan Marie Lambert. Her performance has the most nuance I found with a realistic depiction of fear without being annoying from her screams. I adored Veronica Cartwright as Lambert since she felt genuine in her dismay and concern. Her little nervous glances and wide eyed terror is really apt as she's like an audience conduit.\n\nSir John Hurt is phenomenal as the kind and brave Gilbert Ward Kane with a shocking performance for sure. Harry Dean Stanton is funny as the cheery and ever complaining Samuel Elias Brett. Ian Holm's Ash is intriguing as the science officer on board The Nostromo with a hard and quiet attitude.\n\nTom Skerritt is excellent as the wise and calm Captain Arthur Koblenz Dallas. Yaphet Kotto is boisterous as the loud and irritable engineer Dennis Monroe Parker. Each cast member kills it in Alien.\n\nJerry Goldsmith's score is disquieting. His subtle symphony envelops you in bold seething madness and cold paranoia. John Mollo's costumes for the crew are cool space suits with a natural look for added realism. \n\nIn all, Alien remains a must watch for horror fans and sci-fi acolytes alike. Space doesn't seem worth exploring anymore due to the potential for encountering aliens like in Alien.",

Every inch of it has been perfectly designed to be as terrifying and unsettling as possible: its smooth, black, eyeless head; its hook-like tail; its squatting, scuttling figure; and of course its slimy mouth within a mouth. The movie itself is just as thoughtfully put together as the monster is. Immediately, the audience feels uncomfortable and displaced as they are slowly lead through an empty spaceship. The characters are slightly disoriented as well, awakening from hibernation to find a distress signal from a mysterious planet. The mystery is what defines the movie. We never learn much about what they're doing on this ship in deep space. We never know, and neither do the characters, where the crashed ship they discover is from or where it was going or who the alien corpse is or why it was transporting dangerous eggs. We also see very little of the Xenomorph until the final showdown as it keeps to the shadows, killing quickly and quietly. We're quite a way into the movie before we even see the fully grown alien at all, as the film builds very slowly with the crew of the Nostromo confronting their enemy in each of its developing forms. Ash, the ship's science officer, is particularly interested in the alien and he proves to be a significant threat himself, played by Ian Holm to a quietly threatening effect. The real standout among the cast, however, is Sigourney Weaver, who plays Ripley, the surprise (for the time) heroine. She is tough yet still feminine and totally believable as the last survivor. Ridley Scott deserves equal credit for the success of Ripley, for it was his decision to change the gender of the lead role, and of course, his expert direction of the entire movie that makes it a masterpiece of sci-fi, horror, and film in general.",

So, they cut it from Alien so they could make it an Aliens \"iconic\" scene. This means there is about 10 minutes of pointless running around that works well enough in Alien, but going back and forth just because you get scared isn't a legitimate excuse to be so flagrantly negligent, and it makes the opening of Aliens make Perfect sense; because she Was acting with questionable judgement.

            "content": "For a film that often appears on lists of the greatest science fiction films of all time it is easy to forget how simple the plot of the film is. What makes it exceptional is how well director Ridley Scott builds up tension and anticipation and how the screenplay gives us a sense of who these characters are and the differences between their leadership styles. I don't love the film simply because I am predisposed to dislike most films in the horror and science fiction genres but I can admire it as a great technical achievement and was relatively entertained while watching it. \n\nOn the small spaceship Nostromo a crew of seven astronauts have been in stasis for a long period of time and are tasked with bringing alien life back to their home planet. They are notified that a moon they pass by is inhabited by alien life forms and Kane, John Hurt, is attacked by one of the aliens, a \"Xenomorph\", which causes the logical Ripley to want him to stay outside of the ship. In a moment of weakness the onboard doctor Ash, Ian Holm, allows him in and the alien makes it's way into the ship and slowly kills all of the crew members except for Ripley. She is able to escape in a pod but has little hope or enthusiasm for the future.\n\nWhere the real interest of the film lies is in seeing Ripley and Ash face off with his more forgiving, mellow responses to disasters coming into conflict with her ruthless, businesslike approach. The first mistake that he makes is letting Kane back into the Nostromo when he has been infected by an alien and from there he continues to make decisions that endanger himself and the crew of the Nostromo. Ripley immediately notes that despite the fact that they want to keep their friend safe they should take into account the lives of those who are not infected and not let the alien onboard the ship. She is forthright in her criticism of his actions but does not raise his voice and speaks logically in her attempt to prevent potential harm from coming to them. She is rational and in control of her emotions unlike the women portrayed in other 1970s films like M*A*S*H (1970) and her gender is not highlighted by the film which allows her to be seen as a person and not an object to be desired or a contrived example of feminist values in human form. Her male counterparts are intelligent and have the forceful presence to match her but even then we can see the flaws in their decision making as Ripley does.\n\nThere is also the fact that the film takes it's time to introduce threats and does not feel the need to include a jump scare within it's first 45 minutes which most mediocre horror films from this period do. It is better than the cheap Roger Corman produced genre schlock that was made during this era because Scott is more focused on the lead up to moments of shock and terror than giving into the cheap thrills that threaten to ruin most films of this sort. We hear the near silence as the crew of the ship make their way around and dread builds in the pit of our stomachs because we know that somewhere an alien lurks and it will jump out of the shadows at any moment. The confidence of the crew is also irritating as we can sense that the alien is smarter than half of them and their belief that they will be able to efficiently and easily exterminate it allows us to understand why many of them put themselves in harm's way. We want to see Ripley and all of her comrades survive but she is the only one with enough wits to see that the aliens are a formidable force and she will need to use all of her ingenuity in order to survive. \n\nThen there is the fact that the end of the film presents a bleak view of the future and what Ripley's opportunities are beyond the hellish experience she has just gone through. Her closing communication with whoever runs the ship she is traveling on suggests that almost everybody has to live out in space in the future that the film depicts and she will find herself in a galaxy and not back on earth when she reaches safety. Her desperation soon fades into simple relief but we feel a sort of guilt as it dawns on her that there will be no reprieve from a painful life in the world she inhabits.",

Alien is a perfect example of a director gradually elevating the level of energy and anticipation in a motion picture. The way Scott meticulously raises the sense of menace and tension is worthy of Hitchcock. This atmosphere-soaked production relies on the viewer's imagination to enhance the alien's nightmarishness. Scott carefully restricts how much we see of the creature - there's enough to provide our minds with horrifying images, but not so much that the illusion is spoiled. Alien contains its fair share of genuine scares. These aren't mere \"boo\" moments, where something benign jumps out of the shadows accompanied by a loud noise and a musical crescendo, but legitimate shocks. The first occurs when the face-hugger leaps out of the egg and attaches itself to Kane. The second is when the alien explodes through Kane's chest.

A group of astronauts receives some kind of signal and to check it they land on a planet where one of them is attacked by an Alien creature. And the whole story is about Alien killing them one by one and they try to kill the Alien.\nDespite being simple, the movie scary and powerful. One such scene is when an alien creature burst out of the chest of Kane and everyone was just shocked. The film begins with an effective tone and keeps the same till the end. While watching Alien there is something which kept me attached to the film. Sometimes you just literally want to save the characters but you can't. \nAlien is visionary and terrifying at the same time. There is a scene in which the Alien kills a man in front of a Cat. You can see the horror in the eyes of that cat. Ridley Scott directed this scene so well that it scares the hell out of you. \nAlien Creature constantly reminded me of Velociraptors of Jurassic Park (1993), you don't know when and from where it will attack.\nAlien is a 1979 film, still, it is visually stunning, for which it got an academy award too. The idea of an Alien attacking human is nothing new but it is Sir Ridley Scott, who presented the story is such a brilliant and unique way that it seems original and refreshing. The film is technically strong. All the actors have played their role well but Sigourney Weaver was fantastic. \nOverall Alien is beautifully directed masterpiece, garnished with horror elements and is a must-watch.",

It does what films these days gloss over with effects: gives texture and depth the the environment in which the viewer is now more of a participant than an observer. With minimal back story you make a connection with the characters and find yourself invested in even the scum bags. This is by no means a perfect film, but it came on the heels of Princess Leia with female empowerment, decades before it was even a thing. When was the action hero ever NOT at least somewhat sexualized? You're lying if you say you never had an Arnold moment in the shower. Lol! Even the dudes! But seriously, I can't believe I waited this long to actually watch this movie... Besides the obvious reason that I usually hate \"horror\" movies, despite loving a good sci-fi. A perfect blend of genres, definitely more on the side of Star Trek than Pandorum (which was also weird that I even gave that a shot, let alone the fact I loved it.)

Written by Dan O Bannon, expertly directed by Scott (in what was then his 2nd film only) and utilizing the works of great artisan craftsman like H.R Giger and Ron Cobb Alien is a masterpiece of most facets of filmmaking. The actors are all incredibly good in their respective roles of space grunts, but 29-year-old Sigourney Weaver shines the most. Alien is 40 years old (!!!) and yet it is as timeless as if it were made last year. The sets and creature design look fantastic as does the pacing which only reinforces the belief that a good film doesn't have to be swiftly paced.",

What a silly boy. After seeing Alien I was terrified of the creature for years. It wasn't until 1996 after I had been on sleep medication due to nightmares for 4 years that I overcame my fear. How did that happen. Well a school counselor came up with a brilliant idea. He wanted me to figure out how the director shot every scene in aliens and made me watch it over and over again and explain the scenes. It was a brilliant idea, just like Alien. Alien is all about mood, pace and the craft of film-making. Every person involved in this film brought something to the table and you can see the end result. It is real, visceral and deep on so many levels. Just talking about the film and it's sexual themes can take hours because most people don't notice most of it. There is arguments that the alien is weak and dying because of it's color change and slow movement. It just kills people because they keep making so much noise or because they are intruding in it's area. Whatever the case of any debate they are endless for this film much like all good Sci-fi films. This one holds the crown in my opinion over all of them.",

This classic horror drama is smart and mature on its sharp screenplay. And since the concept allows it to rely upon physical sequences, the tactics and methods used in to make a best out of a crisis, is pure genius. Despite of being short handed on visual effects, this sci-fi venture leads you to a darker and sinister path through your own imaginations. Scott uses sound and light effects to scare his viewers. This horror isn't based on any mythological or spiritual tales to create horrifying environment or on building a backstory for its cynicism.\n\nThis is a human surviving out in the nature that it fails to understand or connect with. One of the major apprentice of Scott is the uncertainty of the characteristics of the antagonist depicted in here. Among many, many deaths, one of the best sequence is the one that follows a guy chasing a cat and water dripping over him, not only does this sequence gives you goosebump audibly but the way it is shot, the visuals too are jaw dropping. The structure of the script isn't your usual in and out mission, the first half executed with sweat drop precision adds more thrill to the last breathtaking act.\n\nWeaver as the fittest survival of all, is the real deal. Her three dimensional character is aptly cooked. The range offered to her by the writers is wide enough to flaunt her talent and she milks out the best she can from it, she is vulnerable and flawed yet brave and bold enough to stand against the impossible, the arc that takes place in front of her molds for a better illuminating character. Alien was and is definitely ahead of its time, the future is clearly visible in here.",

However, this \"haunted house in space\" film was one of the first to effectively cross-pollinate these two genres. Alien became the blueprint for dozens of rip-offs and three sequels. In addition to blending graphic horror with science fiction, Alien has another distinction - it is one of the first films to feature a female action hero. Even today, on those rare occasions when a woman takes the lead in an action/adventure movie, she is typically measured up to Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley. Alien contains its fair share of genuine scares. These aren't mere \"boo\" moments, where something benign jumps out of the shadows accompanied by a loud noise and a musical crescendo, but legitimate shocks. The first occurs when the face-hugger leaps out of the egg and attaches itself to Kane. The second is when the alien explodes through Kane's chest. A masterpiece (Sci-fi horror supreme).",

The great direction by Ridley Scott is one that any actor would kill to have on all there productions. Also, all the sets, props, costumes, and animatronics look better than most summer blockbusters today. A prime example of how good the movie looks is the scene where they're looking at the insides of the face hugger which was made up of seafood. All the performances were top notch.

Lovecraft\n\nAlien, for me, is the consummate horror film. It excels in everything that I love about the genre, while avoiding the cliches and pitfalls that plague so many others.\n\nThe entire film is filled with a sense of foreboding, creeping dread. Even before the team reaches the unknown planet, there's sense of darkness on the horizon. The viewer just knows, deep in their gut, that something is wrong.\n\nThe cinematography is so incredibly good. The camera angles, the lighting, the special effects... all of it utilized to accentuate the horror that is creeping aboard the Nostromo. I especially like the way that shadow and light are used in juxtaposition to show just enough, and veil the rest in shadow.\n\nThe scenes where Dallas (Tom Skerritt) explores the air shafts in attempt to lure the alien feel downright claustrophobic, and that in itself is stressful and intense.\n\nI love the fact that the alien itself is rarely shown, or shown in quick sequences. Once you see something, once you can quantify it, it is no longer horrifying.\n\nThe musical score and sound effects are superb. The music is eerie and cosmic, evoking thoughts of space and the darkness between the stars.\n\nI really appreciate the fact that all of the characters were developed in such a short period of time. It felt as though you were on the Nostromo, part of the crew. Very few films really make you care about their characters, but Alien succeeds. This is due, in part, to the phenomenal performances from everyone involved.\n\nAlien messes with the viewers' minds in many ways, and it is genius. Ash (Ian Holm) clearly has ulterior motives from the beginning of the film, but who would have guessed him to be an android sent to protect the alien? Isn't Ash, clearly not human, an alien himself?\n\nThe final sequence, with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) on the escape pod, is some of the best cinematic sleight of hand I've ever seen. The film beckons you to watch her undress, to gaze at her shapely and exposed body, right before revealing that she is not alone on that escape pod. Fantastic.\n\nAlien will always remain one of my favorite horror movies, and I long for a time when the genre returns to this level of greatness.",

You can't blame H.R. Giger though, his design work on the film attains high-art status.  The eye-catching sets may be the most entertaining part of the film.  Though unfortunately some versions of the alien (especially in the famous stomach scene) elicit unintentional laughs.  \n\nThis would all be forgivable if the plot contained a deeper underlying theme.  But unlike earlier classics of the genre, like The Day the Earth Stood Still, this is a straight-up popcorn movie.  It looks cool, is comedic in an antiquated manner, and with a scare here and a gross twist there, it entertains.  Not to be overlooked is the casting of perhaps the first female action hero lead.  But with nothing tethering the story to a theme that resonates, much like its protagonist, it's lost in space.",

It's not so much a monster but a force of terrifying evil made all the more frightening by the fact that you mostly only get brief glimpses of it and that it does not speak or give any clues as to its origins, feelings, or purpose. It is the most alien of all alien screen creations. Only (quite big) disappointment for me occurs at the very end when the full form of the creature is momentarily revealed - clearly a man in a monster suit, not dissimilar to the one in the Creature from Black Lagoon.

It is a pity that those watching Alien today cannot see it through eyes of a person who saw it for the first time in 1979. \n\nIn 1979 there was nothing to prepare a movie goer for what they were about to see. Nothing was like it before and films like it after are, to some extent, an homage.\n\n Star Trek and Star Wars projected a futuristic view of a Utopian world so far advanced and different from present day life and science.  The Star Wars spacecrafts had clean futuristic lines and the costuming and gadgets were wonderous\n\nA Horror movie in space was essentially new territory. 'The Thing' was perhaps most similar to Alien and has been said to inspire the story. The isolation and foreboding of the Arctic was similar to the emptiness but at the same time claustrophobia of space travel.\n\nExcept for the suspended animation chambers in the beginning of Alien, this future is unremarkable and not very awe inspiring\nThe ship is a hulking unimpressive bilgy utilitarian vessel not unlike a present-day cargo ship. \nThe crew is not a well-honed team but a scowling, complaining   bunch putting in a day's work.  Their dress and appearance convey how unremarkable and undisciplined they are, as is their attitude.  \nThere is no endearing android like R2D2 or CP30 here either.   These clearly are not the buck Rodgers, Han Solo heroes that we had come to expect from our spacemen and women prior to Alien. \nThey are not much different from us which, perhaps, makes Alien even more frightening.\n\nIn 1979 there was no CGI remotely like what we have to day. The dark steamy hell of the planet and the Alien were created with 1970s techniques and yes, meat parts.   The music by Jerry Goldsmith is perfection in building nerve grating tension.  The sound affects are the little mentioned costar of this movie. The jarring and ominous computer sounds set the uneasy mood. The subtle organic sounds of the movements of the Alien made it that much more frightening.\n\nUnlike todays incredible CGI video games, Apple II and Atari crude video games like space invader and Asteroids could never have prepared us to what we were about to see in this movie.  The original Alien trailer was perhaps one the most effective trailers ever produced.\nIt gripped TV viewers to the extent that it created anticipation and tension even before going to the theater.\n\nI often wondered how Alien would differ if it were filmed in Black and White. It is primarily filmed in disturbing muted color; essentially Film Noir. I have intentionally viewed it in B&W only and believe me, it adds a whole new dimension.\n\nI can remember when Alien was first reviewed.  One reporter interviewed people who had walked out of the movie because they were so disturbed by it. The tension was too unbearable to them.\n\nI wish that new viewers could see Alien the way we in 1979 did... never experiencing anything like it before... and not desensitized and maybe jaded by the following 37 years and 21st century digital wizardry.\nThe Next Time Alien is on your TV, turn on your sound system and transport yourself to a theater in 1979 surrounded by nervous movie goers already squirming as they view the famous slowly appearing fragmented title sequence.  People already started to squeal during the opening scene and sound effects of the ship awakening even before a character was seen or a word of dialog was said.    \n\nTry to block out the following 40 years of Hollywood high tech and yes try turning off the color for a different film Noir experience.",

            "content": "Alien (1979) Movie Review\n\n\tIf you really think about it, the original Alien movie is about as complex of a storyline as Halloween or Vacation. All it is is a big scary alien on a spaceship killing people. And it's done so well that I might even like it more than its fantastic sequel, Aliens. So in case you haven't seen Alien, here is the basic synopsis. In deep space, the ship Nostromo gets a distress call from an unknown planet. They get to the planet and find hundreds of alien eggs. Kane (John Hurt), one of the ship's mechanics, is attacked by the creature that hatches from one of the eggs. The crew figures out that the distress call they received was actually a warning. They flee the planet and start to investigate the extraterrestrial life form attached to Kane's head, called a facehugger. Eventually the crew freezes the facehugger off of Kane and everything returns to normal. But at breakfast that day, Kane dies in what is possibly one of the most memorable death scenes in any movie ever when another alien, called the chestburster, aptly bursts out of his chest. The chestburster scurries off into the depths of the ship, and the crew is left with no choice but to track it down. Soon enough they realize that the alien has evolved and is picking them off one by one. Needless to say, Alien is truly amazing. The special and practical effects are both spectacular, especially for the time. I also must add that the costume work on both the crew members' uniforms and the xenomorph (the titular alien) in particular are excellent. I'm trying not to run out of synonyms to great: I've already used fantastic, excellent, spectacular, and amazing. Next up is incredible I think. Ridley Scott's direction of the movie is incredible. The lighting and suspense add to the overall horror vibe of Alien, which is something Aliens lacks. I mean, Aliens is good and all, but to be honest, it's really not that scary. Alien is scary. The xenomorph is terrifying, far more menacing than the Yautja of the Predator series. And the constant sequences of suspense and then jump scares are great because they never let you breath. Even the first half of the movie, which has close to zero scares, is chilling because you just know that awful things are going to happen to these people. If you watch other confined horror movies like the other Alien movies, Predator, or The Thing, then you know that the fact that it is set in a claustrophobic place makes it scarier. Sure, you feel it in those movies. But while I was watching Alien, I REALLY felt the whole \"closed in\" thing. There's really nowhere to hide. In Predator, the jungle is a pretty big place, so I guess you can kind of move around. In The Thing, you can always just go outside, but you'd probably freeze to death. In Aliens, there's the ship, and the planet, and all of those places. But in Alien, it's just the ship and that's it. There's no escape (don't even bring up the escape pod because I don't really want to rewrite all of those sentences). I thought that almost all of the actors in this movie did a great job. Especially Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm as Ripley and Ash. For some reason I felt like Ash wasn't a good name for Ian Holm's character. Ash is a name for a generic teenage boy or a grumpy dog or some mythical action hero. Not a snobby English android. Ash just doesn't seem like an Ash. At first, you can't really tell who the main character is. So great.",

The effects remain great. The xenomorph, the chestburster scene, that specific scene with LOTR Bilbo. It moves at a steady pace which makes everything seem all the more scary as you notice something and think to yourself \"Look behind you!!!\"  Ridley Scott wasn't joking around when making this scary sci-fi movie that makes the idea of forced pregnancy even more frightening especially since a man suffers this fate.

Alien is the answer. When I was a kid, I've heard about the Alien films. Okay, I haven't seen them cause my dad told me they're disgusting films. It's kind of scary that he told me that. Alien is a film that everybody loved and got terrified by it. it came to be one of the scariest films of the 70's and when I first watched them as an adult, it scared the freaking hell out of me, well, not much because I'm not a wuss. Alien is the first to scare me. The opening had a scary reputation to creep me more than that, I watched some movie scary opening credits with creepy music and now this. Sigourney Weaver many people say is a great actress. Come to think of it, my mum is a huge fan of her. She's great as Ellen Ripley and all the other cast are great. The story is so gripping sometimes the film may have boring parts as a horror film but that's just the pace. The crew have woken up from their beds and then waiting to get home but has to find something what was crash landed in the island and Kane got face hugged by the creepy crawly things. Now Dallas and Ash had to get back to take a look at Kane getting face hugged, what's giving him. The face hugger's have acid for blood. And you know all the rest. I won't have to go into too much detail cause the audience have seen it for many years and you know classics never die. The alien is a creepy looking creature with a second mouth inside his mouth. Kind of a tongue mouth, ain't it? But the face? Yeah, that is incredibly looking creepy. And the scene that Kane dies because the alien is inside him and you've all remember what happens to people if the alien is inside the body? Behold, I give you the most terrifying, the most incredible, the most scariest scene that could ever give you nightmares, THE CHESTBURSTER! For me, though, it doesn't give me nightmares. There are some scary moments in this that always got my attention. OK, now, the video game I've played and that's Alien Isolation. This is after the film Alien before Aliens. Now when I was playing on the game though, it scared the hell out of me. I mean, REALLY scared me to death. Because when I actually come across the aliens, one  for one actual reason has climbed down the ceiling and I have to duck down so that it couldn't see me. If I throw something out there the alien comes and searches something. I can tell by the sounds they're making. And I died by the alien that really does scare me. Everytime the alien comes, I kind of swore under my breath because how scary it is. The way the game is, the way that creature looks and the way it snawls, it's just pure scary. All right, so that's it for the game and I guess it's time for me to get back on my review. Alien is one of the scariest films I've ever watched and I frigging love it. My mum loves it too. Don't get me wrong, the movie's there, they're get you on your hat. the ending where Ripley escapes is really gripping because it feels like you're in the hurry. The hurry that when you're on the ship and getting the hell out of here before the time runs out. If you don't, the ship will explode. That got me right in here! It's kind of feels like you're leaving someone behind because they're dead, and yeah, the crew is already dead cause the alien killed them. There are some scenes that wasn't in the film and I already know that already so I can't remember any scene that wasn't in the original version. I already knew the scene where Ripley and Parker heard Bret screaming after he got slaughtered which is why I think that it should have included on the original. In fact, why can't all the missing scenes be in the original, there's always a catch. I don't know. Because they're from the Director's Cut. I think the Special Edition versions did the same to all the Alien films. There's no doubt about it. This is one of the greatest fantastic disgusting scariest science fiction horror film that ever hit the big screen in the late 70's. That is, uh, the lights are off in here. I could watch it every night and not get scared by it! Get ready for the sequel which I'm going to do in the meantime. Now sit back and get ready for a SPOOOOOKY night!",

But whatever, this movie is awesome. I don't know if it's because it's 80-ish movie. I know it came out in 1979 but it was so innovative at the time that it was so futuristic and at the same time makes you wonder if we ever come across an alien that is so hostile. Just like the one in this movie. Sigourney Weaver plays the iconic character named Ripley. When the crew wakes up, they're long away from home and so close to danger. When they find something mysteriously interesting, everything starts out weird and then completely horrifying. Everything in this movie is what we expected when we watch a sci-fi horror film. Sci-fi movies like this tend to be very grim, especially the ones back then. Alien movie is of no exception and if you do like horror films then don't skip out on this one. Actually don't skip out on all the Alien movies. Even the latest ones like Prometheus and Covenant. The suspense is there and the brief yet good enough character developments are there as well. All you need to know is will the crew survive? I think we all know that already but if you haven't seen it yet then the question applies to you. Until then, just watch the movie.

Ridley Scott's terrific classic film tells the story about these people who are in a space and get a distress and violent call from an alien vessel. The terror begins when they find out that there are thousands of eggs from unidentified species in the ship with them. As soon as they find out about this, a mysterious creature latches itself on to one of the crew members and the crew tries to release it off of his face. Eventually, the creature releases itself and dies with the member unharmed. As the rest of the film progresses, the crew finds out that they're not the only ones in the ship when these in particular deaths occur to the crew one by one from these monstrous unknown species and they have to think of a way to stick together and survive from these monsters.",

            "content": "This is one of the rare movies that I can watch a few times a year, and I never get sick of watching it ... and it took me well into my 20s before I dared watch it with the lights off.\n\nThe details of the story itself is where the horror starts ... not in the amazing visuals, but in the simple idea of what is one of the most horrifying things most of us go through, and that is the idea of giving birth ... it fills women with anxiety, and for men, the thought of going through it is a nightmare.  Take away the joy of birth and miracle of creation, and distill the process down to the core fear, pain, blood, and anxiety, and you have the origins of this great story.  At the reptilian level of our brains, it is virtually impossible to sit through this and not feel a sickly fear.\n\nVisually, this is no rubber suited actor ... this is an actor in a work of art!  Giger's macabre masterpiece of design was the no-brainer to win the Oscar, and despite over 30 years having passed, no one has come close to bringing a more horrifying monster to life.  Pair this with the darkness, the steam, and confined space, and what little you were shown was the seed from which the nightmare grew in your mind.\n\nJerry Goldsmith continues a trend of minimalist music that works brilliantly here ... not quite as atonal as his work on \"Planet of the Apes\".  You don't need a sweeping score to aid your emotions this time ... his mood music fits the bill perfectly.  While not as appreciated as some of his better known work in \"Chinatown\", \"The Omen\", or even \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\", Goldsmith's score for Alien is perfect for setting a dark and dreadful mood.\n\nThe big surprise in the film isn't the final stinger at the end ... rather it is the gradual elevation of a woman to the role of hero in a horror film.  In the beginning, Weaver's Ellen Ripley is the last character to speaker their first lines in the film.  At first you think the hero will be the captain (Tom Skerritt) or the intrepid explorer (John Hurt), but not until the crew is whittled down to the sole survivor do you realize it is this woman, scared out of her wits, who will be alive for the final confrontation.  It is brilliant, pioneering writing matched with a great performance that does not give away the heroism too soon.\n\nIt spawned many, many pretenders, and set a bar so high that with the exception of James Cameron's brilliant sequel, none of the followup films have approached this level of emotion.  It is a landmark film within the genre, and overall a classic in the art of film making.",

All thanks to Ridley Scott's flawless direction.\n\nThe reason I say it's brilliant is because Scott putts his full attention on every detail possible.

The film is packed with some of the best camera quality I've ever seen, AND THIS WAS RELEASED BACK IN 79!\n\nThe story was also captivating. A group of people are on a large spaceship and are trying to survive a xenomorph (alien) which is on it. During this movie, I tried to put myself in the characters shoes.

            "content": "A fantastic time-capsule from the late '70s, the era of patient filmmaking, practical effects and potent new ideas. In borrowing from and expanding upon themes first incubated in Kubrick's 2001, director Ridley Scott delivers a tangible, chilling take on humanity's star-faring future. The basic concept is devilishly simple: a hapless freighter crew lands on an uncharted planet, picks up a murderous uninvited guest, then spends the rest of the picture trying (and failing) to outlast it in a claustrophobic environment. But there's so very much more to it than that. Expert character development rewards us with an intensely human, accessible crew. It really hurts each time one of them succumbs to a howling, terrified death. The film represents a master class in tension-building, investing long spans of film in thick, dramatic pauses that pay dividends. It works as a social allegory, too: even generations from now, with our destiny amidst the stars, the working class draws the short straw and risks everything for a meager paycheck. And, perhaps most impressive of all, it's a jaw-dropping visual powerhouse. The style in this film is unmatched, from the fuzzy monitors and tangled wires aboard the flight deck to H.R. Geiger's legendary grotesque monster and environment designs. We enjoy a constant sense of wonder, awed by what we're seeing but grounded by the perceived physical reality of it all. All this, and I haven't even mentioned the acting, direction or effects work. A sci-fi legend through and through, this is one of the best-realized (and finest-aging) genre torchbearers ever.",

Share a kinship with movies like: shark, Halloween and others that involve varied spiders, snakes, tarantulas and persecutors. But the looks end many before that.\n\nOne of the great strengths of \"Alien\" and consequently of director Ridley Scott, is his pace. \"Alien\" takes your time. He waits. It allows silences (the majestic opening shots are underlined by Jerry Goldsmith with only distant metallic vibrations). This suggests the enormity of the team's discovery, building itself up with small steps: the interception of a signal (is it a warning or an SOS?). The descent to the extraterrestrial surface. The bitching by Brett and Parker, who care only about collecting their shares. The master stroke of the dark surface through which the crew members move, their helmet lights hardly penetrate the soup. The shadowy outline of the alien ship. The sight of the alien pilot, frozen in his command chair. The enormity of the discovery inside the ship.\n\n\"Alien\" uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the film: it evolves the creature's nature and appearance, so we never know exactly what it looks like and what it can do. We assume that, in the first place, the eggs will produce a humanoid, because that is the shape of the petrified pilot on the alien ship long lost. But of course we do not even know if the pilot is of the same race as the load of leathery eggs. Maybe he also considers them as a weapon. The first time we take a good look at the alien, when it explodes in the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic, and critic Tim Dirks mentions his \"open and dripping vaginal mouth.\"\n\nCertainly, the character of Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, would have attracted readers of the Golden Age of Science Fiction. She has little interest in the novel of finding the alien, and even less in her employer's orders that it be brought back home as a potential weapon. After she sees what she can do, her response to \"Special Request 24\" (\"Return to alien life form, all other priorities rescinded\") is succinct: \"How can we kill it?\" His relentless hatred for the alien is the common thread running through the three \"Alien\" sequences, which have gradually declined in quality but retain their motivating obsession.\n\nFinally, there is the inheritance that \"Alien\" made possible to the genre Sci-Fi and in addition and much more besides the franchise films that followed after the film of 1979, glimpses the craft relation of producing a film that could go by the yearnings of the Commercial cinema and also by the relation of not giving up the original embryo and not clich\u00e9 between suspensions, terror and fiction.",

When the crew of the Nostromo reach a foreign planet that may contain life, a mysterious life form attaches itself to one of the crew and begins to wreck havoc on the ship.\n\nIf you enjoy this movie then I envy you. I genuinely do. I just cannot see the appeal in this movie and would want nothing more than to understand it but I just cannot. Nothing in this movie is particularly frightening, the story is pretty bland and weak and don't get me started on the evil lighting. Not to say I can't see any strengths in the movie. Sigourney Weaver was, to start, really good as Ripley and redefined the movie heroine. To be fair, the majority of the cast did a good job and sold their role. Except for Lambert, Lambert can go to hell. The Xenomorph is also one of the best designed aliens/creatures in movie history and I do congratulate them for holding that title. Despite these revolutionary things that this movie did for cinema, it's just not scary. The number one thing a HORROR movie should be to make me scared or tense or fearful but I just didn't. This isn't down to the effects which are actually good but rather down to the lack real atmosphere or anything to make the movie feel more intense. Again, If you like this movie then I'm happy for you but I just don't see what is so good about it.\n\nIn my opinion, the story for this movie is utter stupidity. When some scientists and astronauts, some of the most capable minds on Earth, find an Alien egg on a foreign planet, and their first thought is 'let's stick my face right into it', you know that this movie is god damn stupid. The plot makes literally no sense and its all down to some of Earth's most capable people deliberately breaking rules to keep them alive. That said, I did like the ending and do see it as being genuinely frightening seeing that in cinema's. That said, I think that it meant less to me for the fact I saw it on DVD, and knew how long was less. In addition to that, they do also kind of build up that something will happen without directly saying it, thus ruining the surprise. \n\nAgain, I will also compliment the cast for this movie. Pretty much everyone from the wonderful Signourney Weaver to the chilling Ian Holm provided a solid performance and in some ways created the tropes so many Science-Fiction movies would follow today. With the reckless captain, the level headed vice, the crazy scientist - all of that probably derived from this movie and I respect them for that. Now for someone who I couldn't stand in this movie: Veronica Cartwright as Lambert. Screw Lambert. If she died before the script was even written, I would have maybe liked this movie. She was so obnoxious and no annoying and whiny - she puts Temple of Doom's Winnie to SHAME at some points. If that was the point, then fair enough but it doesn't excuse one of the most frustratingly annoying characters I've seen in a long, long time.\n\nSomething this movie was praised greatly for was it's 'eerie' and 'tense' cinematography. How? I don't get it? Sure the movie is tightly edited and the camera was steady but I don't see how this movie revolutionised how these movies are filmed. That and the lighting was ridiculous. If you have epilepsy, do NOT watch this movie. Don't even look at the box because that might cause seizures. I respect Ridley Scott immensely and love him as a director but I had to look away from some scenes purely because of the lighting, and I've never had issues with that; my eyes are actually more used to glaring lights so it shouldn't have affected me but I thought I was going blind at points.\n\nA horror movie should be scary, yes? I've always assumed that is what a horror film should do but from the pedestal this movie is placed on, I don't understand why. I was never, at any point in this movie, tense or scared, or even slightly concerned. This is nothing to do with the effects/alien design(which are both pretty good by the way) but more to do with the lack of atmosphere. A lack of atmosphere can make a movie disturbing but I think it just made this movie less enjoyable. This movie's primary directive was to make me scared but I don't think it did that in any way.\n\nIn conclusion, I do, to some degree, respect this movie. It revolutionised some aspects of cinema and things like the Xenomorphm, or ship design still echo through the ranks of cinema today. That said, I just couldn't enjoy this movie. I felt no emotion towards any of the characters. I felt so actual care. I just didn't enjoy this movie and it genuinely saddens me to say that because I wanted nothing more than to like these movies. Perhaps I'll enjoy 'Aliens' but I just can't say I recommend this movie.\n\n4/10",

And yet the grandeur of the film's  aesthetics has, if anything, gained an additional patina of true artistry. Most admirable is the economy with which the plot advances and the atmosphere of cosmic terror is generated, with patient suspense (although the cat thing can get a bit annoying), interesting design, symbolic manipulation, minimal but convincing human interactions,  and a great play of light and shadows. It is good to remember what all this meant after the cheesiness of Star Wars, and before the definitive masterstroke that was Blade Runner.  Still today, when placed alongside all the various sequels of a truly degenerate franchise, this one stands out as the pure, original monster of a great, classic movie.",

            "content": "I have to confess, I saw Aliens before I watched Alien, Aliens actually being the gateway film to the franchise and I'll touch more on Aliens in that rewind review soon. In fact, I should probably write that first seeing as that's the film that got me hooked. Be right back! \n\nRight, it's actually really hard to watch Alien without knowing anything about it, it's biology, ecology and it's evolution. There was so much more to just H.R. Giger's perverse yet perfect creation, some of it's character not coming to life until writing out the screenplay. It's acid for blood self-defence mechanism wasn't hatched until the writers Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett had to devise a reason why the crew couldn't just simply remove the facehugger from Kane's head. The title itself was originally coined as Star Beast before settling for Alien. Eventually the overall design became so original with acid blood, the lack of eyes, the snapping, salivating double jaw and that rustic breathing. it's phallic, black glistening head and it's skeletal and lethal tail. It's a terrifying yet beautiful creation that has become such an icon for intergalactic monsters. \n\nPlus the ingenious evolution of it's making. The eggs and spin forth that crab-like carrier that impregnates and plants a parasite into its host via the throat to then violently give birth in a way that is so similar to braconid wasps that lay their eyes inside beetles and other insects for their larvae to eat their way out of the living host. Sounds horrifying right? These guys imagined what that would be like if the host was a human being. \n\nThe quality of production really raised itself's from many of its fellow science fiction films, especially the exploration of the fallen spaceship with the space jockey being a statement to the audience that this is not a B-movie, or as conceptual artist Ron Cobb coined, to convince 20th Century, \"the Cecil B. DeMille shot.\" It went on to win one Oscar for best effects and nominated for best Art Direction; won two  BAFTAs for best production design and soundtrack, and four Saturn awards for Scott, Weaver, Cartwright and Best DVD collection in 2011.\n\nJerry Goldsmith's score is amazing and perfectly fitting for the film that just heightens the tension of the looming threat. Also the sound engineering is greatly thought out, noises that were resurrected and reused for all future projects such as the 2014 game Alien: Isolation. The ship's klaxons, bleeps and the alien's snapping attack all echo throughout the franchise. \n\nOnly obvious negative now, is now. The fact that the film is dated and looks out of place with the Scott's new additions. They unfortunately didn't get the technology right, I mean who would have thought back in the late seventies the future would have touch screen, retina recognition and voice interactive computers. What makes it worse is that it's set thirty years after the events of Prometheus. It just aesthetically speaking, the films don't fit. \n\nA commercial space freighter is on it's return trip to Earth when the crew is awoken early to response to a distress signal from an unknown planet, LV-426 and being bound by contractual obligation, they venture to investigate. A derelict alien spacecraft isn't the only thing thing discover and tragically set off a chain of horrifying events. It's near impossible to not know of the infamous, gut-wrenching scene of the chestbuster. Even those who have seen the film are possibly familiar with it. It even gets parodied in Mel Brook's Spaceballs, with John Hurt re-enacting that famous scene. \"Oh, no, not again.\" \n\nThe film has been quipped as being \"like Jaws in space and is rightly so like Jaws, rarely showing the alien in its entirety, Bolaji Badejo as the alien actually only having about 4minutes of total screen time. It's like knowing you have a wasp buzzing around the room and you just can't find it, unable to rest until it's left the vicinity.  \n\nScott really makes his make with alien, spawning a new breed of science fiction and horror, drawing influences from Star Wars: A New Hope, 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. His original cut was 192 minutes long; and yes, there is a director's cut of the film but not at 192mins. Prior to this Scott had made The Duelists and a run of episodes for various TV series, so it's fair to say Alien really for him noticed to then follow up with yet another sci-fi noir cult classic, Blade Runner a couple of years later. \n\nScott wasn't the only one to make his big break here. I find it impressive that though Sigourney Weaver has had a number of parts since, even three Oscar nominated roles with Working Girl and Gorillas in the Mist, it's her role as Ellen Ripley that she will be remember most for receiving that other Oscar nomination for playing her in Aliens. What's impressive about this is that it was her first major role and I can't think of any other actor or actress that can lay claim to that. There has be a danger of her being typecast but she's handled it great fashion, starring in Galaxy Quest, Avatar and providing her voice as the Axiom in Wall\u0095E and an episode of Futurama. It's like every geeky, sci-fi filmmaker's dream is to have Weaver star in some capacity in their film. \n\nIt's an incredible piece of cinema that will remain to be one of the best films ever made, reinventing the genre almost entirely.

            "content": "I don't think I have to make it obvious to you all out there that the horror genre is, probably, my favorite movie genre.  There's really no other genre like it in terms of its dedicated fanbase, who will wade through oceans of shit in order to find a modern classic of the genre.  The horror genre also has its opportunists trying to cash in on a dedicated fanbase, who will watch just about anything for their horror fix, and they purposely put out shitty movies knowing that, at least a few people out there in the world will give their film a shot because it's a horror flick.  Superhero flicks are the closest thing possible to this in terms of rabid fanbases.  But the one difference is the fact that hardcore superhero fans aren't seeking out low-budget, independent superhero flicks.  If they were then that market would have been over-saturated by this point, as if it wasn't already saturated in the mainstream.  The point that I'm trying to make is the fact that there are movies that every horror geek should watch, at least, once in their lifetime.  It doesn't even matter if you end up liking the movie or not, but it's something that you must see.  The Exorcist, Evil Dead 2, Carpenter's The Thing are on those list, if I were to compile my own.  And many people would also say that that list wouldn't be complete without Alien.  If I'm gonna be honest, I have absolutely no recollection of ever watching this movie in its entirety.  I'm certain I have, but if I did then it must have been over 20 years ago.  I'm 29 now, so I don't even wanna think of how far back I'd have to go if I actually did watch this movie.  But Alien is just one of those movies that, even without watching it, you know of it by reputation.  Alien is, after all, one of the more financially successful horror franchises in history.  It might even be the most successful horror film franchise of all time, as, across six films, they've managed to gross $1.1 billion worldwide (and Alien Covenant just came out).  Compare that to Friday the 13th which, they've grossed $465 million worldwide across TWELVE movies (Freddy vs Jason is included).  Friday the 13th has twice as many movies as the Alien franchise and it has made less than half of the money.   Honestly, I've been looking for this movie for months.  I contemplated getting the Blu-Ray for this and Aliens, but I just can't afford it right now.  So I had to settle for recording it on DVR off of IFC.  IFC, sadly, has commercials, but they never edit movies for content or time, so this was as close as I was gonna get to watching the original cut without actually spending the money to buy it.  What'd I think of the movie?  I'll be straight up, I don't think I've seen a horror movie do so much with so little.  And I don't mean that in derisive way.  I think one of the benefits with this approach is that you can build so much dread out of showing very little of the actual alien itself.  And that was by design, Ridley Scott made the movie this way, not like in Jaws where the shark not being shown until the end was done more out of necessity.  Showing very little of the alien allows the audience to make up an image of what it looks like in their own mind, this adds more tension and suspense to the scene where the alien is actually shown.  They're also very clever in that, almost, every instance where you see the creature, it has evolved in appearance from the previous scene it appeared in.  First you see the facehugger, then in the next scene you might see it evolve the chestbuster.  The final transformation, of course, is the full-grown xenomorph.  Though you never get a full look at its body, just bits and pieces.  This effect is, of course, lessened when everyone and their mother knows what traditional xenomorphs look like in today's era.  That still doesn't mean that the thought process behind the design of the xenomorph, which is absolutely tremendous, very grotesque and completely reminiscent of its creator's (HR Giger) style.  The other reason the film works so well is that the fact that it takes in such an enclosed spaceship.  You have to deal with the fact that you don't know when this creature is gonna appear and where from, but you also have the claustrophobic setting to boot.  These people are stuck in space with this thing (their shuttle can't carry all of them), so that certainly puts them all on edge.  In terms of narrative, I don't wanna say the movie is empty, because it's not, but it's not the most important thing.  There's clearly some hints here at a bigger picture type thing, like the xenomorph can be used as a weapon.  Again, there's only hints here and I don't even know if Aliens explore these issues at length.  This is a movie more about survival more than any deep existential exploration, as I'm sure Prometheus explored.  They get the survival/space horror in this movie down pat, there's very few movies better than this of this genre.  So, yea, I thought this was a pretty great movie.  It's aged very well, particularly for a movie that turns FORTY years old in two years from now.  It's still a visually intriguing movie, from the way it's shot, to the design of the ship, to the planet the crew explores, it is quite the movie to look at.  And, again, that's even with the fact that it's showing its age in some areas.  The cast is great, no complaints on that front.  Sigourney Weaver is the ultimate badass and she always has been.  She portrays Ripley as a headstrong, yet vulnerable character.  She's not, at least in this movie, a straight-up ass kicker and that makes her a more interesting character than, say, a Rambo, who feels nothing but anger.  I don't know what else I can say about this movie.  Oh, the musical score is great as well.  There's very little about this movie that I didn't like in all honesty.  While I wish I would have watched this without commercials, since they killed some of the flow of the film, this is still a seminal piece of work and one that I would highly, HIGHLY recommend even if you're not a big horror fan.  I think this is the type of movie that transcends the genre.",

Every one of the seven crew members have very distinct personalities and the actors add subtle touches to make all of the character interactions even more interesting and entertaining. The Alien itself is one of the creepiest movie monsters in cinema history too. The dark corridors of the ship help to camouflage the Alien to make it more terrifying and unpredictable. Despite what some claim, this movie is so much more than a slasher movie in space. It deals with sexual anxiety, feminism, the plight of the working class, and an anxiety towards space exploration.

Most of the special effects also hold up quite well, from the ships flying through space, to the breathing of the Face-hugger.

Capt. Dallas's (Tom Skerritt) rescue team discovers a bizarre pod field, but things get even stranger when a face-hugging creature bursts out of a pod and attaches itself to Kane (John Hurt). Over the objections of Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), science officer Ash (Ian Holm) lets Kane back on the ship. The acid-blooded incubus detaches itself from an apparently recovered Kane, but an alien erupts from Kane's stomach and escapes. The alien starts stalking the humans, pitting Dallas and his crew (and cat) against a malevolent killing machine that also has a protector in the nefarious Company. \n\nEvery once in a while, old movies or movies that are already out on DVD come back to the theaters for a short period of time. \"Alien\" was one of those films that came back to the theaters for one day at one time, and I knew I had to see it. Prior to this, I had never seen the film, but I had obviously heard about it. Sadly, my history with old \"classic\" films has not been great, and I actually found this film to be pretty underwhelming, if not just flat out bad.\n\nOne thing I did like was the score. The music worked really well with the movie and the tone they set out to establish. It had this real creepy vibe to it and it created a lot of the experience for me. \n\nI also liked the ability to create suspense in this film. It's a claustrophobic thriller that's meant to keep you on your toes. The movie isn't fast paced or guns blazing, rather, a slow, suspenseful film that's meant to scare you in a different way. I do appreciate the way they were able to build suspense over time. \n\nNow what I didn't like about the movie sadly outweighs the good of the film. First, I thought the acting was terrible. I literally found the acting to be cheesy, over dramatic, and comedic. I think on any objective level of criticism, you can't tell me that these performances were top notch. It was almost laughable what some of these actors did and I felt that it really compromised the film sometimes. Sigourney Weaver was fine as the lead and she was the best one in the film, but no one else really did much to help. If anything, they made it worse. \n\nThe story telling was weak and I felt that the way they executed the story a lot better. The movie felt a bit too long and when I say that, I just mean that there were some overdrawn shots that were bland and unnecessary. It felt that a lot of the setup in the beginning was pretty useless overall, so it made the movie feel longer and more boring then it should've been. \n\nIn the end, \"Alien\" is not too special, and not a movie I would say that's good.",

It spawned an entire franchise, sure, but it also inspired an entire generation of filmmakers that still resonates throughout filmmaking today.  It's often imitated, but never duplicated.\n\nI love going back and re-watching this film because it's one of the few horror films I can remember that isn't tarnished upon second viewing.  It's always hard to make a film that is just as good the second time around, but it's particularly challenging with horror films.  There's something about knowing when each scare is coming and knowing who gets killed off first that usually ruins the fun.  However, 1979's Alien is quite the achievement in transcending the \"trapped in a confined space\" genre.\n\nThe one thing that always shines through with Alien is Ridley Scott's vision.  He's one of those directors that when he's on top of his game, there's no one better at displaying a singular vision for filmmaking.  He was certainly inspired by a few sci-fi's that came before like 2001 or maybe even Forbidden Planet, but Alien is its own entity.  And boy does it possess one particular entity that scared an entire generation.\n\nMuch like the entire film around it, the Xenomorph is a fascinating piece of art.  I love H.R. Giger's design.  I love its origin.  I love that its hidden for half the film.  I love that there's actually a human underneath all that terrifying skin.  Heck, I love that this thing has two mouths, both just as horrifying as the other.  The Xenomorph is as much the star of this film as Sigourney Weaver is, and they both complement each other brilliantly, as strange as that sounds.\n\nBut let's talk about Weaver & the crew.  If there's ever a memorable crew in one of these space mission films, it's in Alien.  And the crazy thing is, you don't necessarily get to know any of them in depth to care about their health and well-being.  Most of the film is spent in silence, which makes it all the more powerful when the Alien does attack.  Sometime less is more, huh?  In its entirety, Alien is one of the greatest films ever made, and easily one of the most memorable.  Whether it's the dinner scene, the cat, Weaver kicking a** in her underwear, the reveal with Ash, or just the endless amount of beautiful establishing shots and production design, Alien is a masterpiece.\n\n+Tension\n\n+Scott's vision\n\n+The production design & effects\n\n+Birth of the Xenomorph\n\n10/10",

Telling the story of an aircraft in the future manned by 7 astronauts that receives a strange call coming from a small mysterious planet, when descending to investigate they end up bringing inside the ship a curious and lethal form of alien life. We have a premise that would be widely copied over the years, with a focus on suspense, creating an atmosphere of terror but without throwing away syfy elements, \"Alien\" does not have a spectacular script, quite the opposite, the same Has many holes that almost 40 years later have not yet been solved, but even so, his script knows how to balance all elements of the film, besides being linear, thought-provoking and have a great rhythm. When \"Alien\" was released the man had already gone to the moon to ten years, even being a film where the space knowledge was not gigantic, the film commits innumerable gaffes, that for example \"Odyssey in space\" of 68 does not commit, that It bothers a little bit, but when we come across photography and the art direction, we leave it a little aside. Unlike other films of the genre, we have a full-blown photograph of dark tones, which is wonderful for the mood of the film, but it betrays a little the art direction of the film, which even dazzles, if it performs spectacularly well, full of buttons, levers And lights, the film perfectly transmits the atmosphere of the interior of a ship, and in a simple way manages to transmit a threatening planet, save a highlight to the interior of the ship to find in the planet of \"Aliens\", it is simply perfect and at the same time We can not fail to mention the great soundtrack, although little present, when the same discreetly participates in the film, always helps to perfectly compose the climate of the film, the edition of the film leaves to be desired, even if it is 2 hours, it seems Which is missing much in the film. We do not have great acting, so let's emphasize our unlikely heroine, the actress Sigourney Weaver - it's great how the movie builds an entire bow for a hero, and then changes that- But our featured character here is Alien himself, his whole aura Mysterious is great, the fact that little appears and is never very visible is fantastic and plays with the viewer's imagination, as well as being extremely scary, And finally, our medal of honor to Ridley Scott for practically grounding a genre And make a great movie. \"Alien\" has problems, it's true, but his virtues are unsurpassed and the film plays its role with extreme perfection.",

Good job in doing such a great and good looking movie in 1979 and with only seven actors to work with (nine, counting the alien and the mother).

Also some of the effects and tricks was very obvious. \nOtherwise a great movie, exceptionally for its time in which it was created.",

Incredible effects (though some moments don't quite stand up, though come on, we are forty years on) and unmatched art direction are what this film is likely remembered for (find me a more frightening depiction of an extraterrestrial creature), but what surprises me is still how terrifying this movie is. The setting is at once claustrophobic and agoraphobic - the crampt, black air ducts and flickering endless hallways of the Nostromo are as isolating and panic-inducing as the expansive emptiness of space that surrounds them and of the massive structure they investigate early in the film. The acting is incredible - you feel fear from each of the ships crew members, which slowly evolves into panic, rage, and resolve for different characters. Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley, third in command aboard her vessel, and the only one who is dedicated to sticking to protocol and keeping level when others don't. Her performance is the stand out, but a wonderful cast surround her, including Ian Holm, who plays a mysterious character who is the recipient of an excellent plot twist. More than a few scenes designed to build suspense relinquish some of their success by lingering too long and slowing the pace, but they're easy to forgive (and you might actually appreciate the relief they offer) when the rest of the film is so edge-of-your-seat, or for some, head-under-the-covers. With respect to Star Wars, this might be the best - and is certainly the scariest - space-centric film of the 70s.\n\nNOTE: Revised from the 5 stars given on Feburary 17, 2017 and fuller review added.",

Alien doesn't need to show the monster more than the 6 times it does, Alien needs to tell a compelling story with three dimensional characters and good acting. All of which this movie achieves. Complaints that this movie features a \"rubber monster\" or practical effects that don't \"tantalize\" are either forgetting that this was made in 1979 or are caught up in the fact that it was made in 1979. Yes the monster looks dated on the wide shots that we get of it, but CGI was essentially non-existent and believe it or not, movies have budgets. The other side of that coin is that the world Alien builds looks and feels too much like Star Wars and the production team was just copying that. To retort, Fox decided to take this project BECAUSE of the immense success of Star Wars. Every movie company rushed to space because Star Wars did so well. Those who watch Alien need to be absorbed into the film, and those opening - so called \"boring\" - shots are there to do that. So if you haven't seen Alien, you really should and keep two things in mind: every second of this film matters and don't expect an overblown in-your-face monster that pops out every other minute. Alien is a fantastic film with superb acting, an original (for the time) plot, and surprisingly good practical effects.",

Released on May 25, 1979 and directed by Ridley Scott, it went on to produce three sequels, a \"prequel\" in the film Prometheus (also directed by Ridley Scott), two crossover films with the popular Predator franchise, and countless comics, video games, and merchandise. But what about the film that started it all? Let's get into that. P.S. There will be some SPOILERS in this review. The film is 37 years old, so if you want the short review: It's good, go watch it! Anyway, on with the review......\n\n  Opening on a cold, panning shot of deep space, the credits do what most opening credits don't even bother to do today; they set the mood. The music is a series of clicks and swells of noise and spooky harmonics. It's truly haunting. We then see the primary setting of the film: The Nostromo, a commercial towing vehicle with a huge mineral ore refinery in tow. The camera moves inside as we get to see all of the intricate hallways and passages of the ship. This shows the claustrophobic setting that we will be dealing with. Everything is cramped and looks dingy and used, and the whole ship is dimly lit. The set design is of particular note throughout the movie. Our main characters are the crew of said ship on a return trip to Earth. They are awakened out of stasis by the main computer of the ship; called MOTHER, to respond to a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. As the Nostromo is just a glorified tow truck in space, the crew is quite small, consisting of just seven people. After a series of discussion about responding to the distress signal and a point being made that they all are REQUIRED to check any sign of \"intelligent life\" or they won't be paid. As all of them are just working stiffs, they begrudgingly go to the planet to investigate the signal. Upon landing on the planet LV-426, three of the crew go outside to check the surface for an indication of where the signal is coming from. They find it inside of a huge, horseshoe shaped spacecraft that looks to have crash landed eons ago. They move into the ship to investigate further, all the while the sounds of the desolate planet winds blow harshly outside. Moving into the bowels of the ship one crew member; Kane, finds an expansive nest of large pods that could be described as eggs. When he moves in to look at one that had opened, a spider-like creature bursts out, breaking through his space helmet and attaching itself to his face. The other two find him and bring him back to the ship. Upon trying to remove the creature from Kane's face the crew finds that when they try to make an incision on the creature's leg, it spews out a highly acidic blood that eats through a few floors of their ship. This thing isn't coming off. After a while they find Kane awake and the creature dead, seemingly falling off and dying on it's own. As they are all eating a meal together, Kane starts coughing and convulsing. A splash of blood and the crack of bone give way as a small snake like being bursts from his chest, killing him. This is the titular \"Alien\". It speeds off into the ducts of the ship as the crew wonder what they just saw. The plan is made to find the little monster (which is about the size of a small cat) and kill/capture it, but the problem is that there are no weapons on the ship, no firearms of any kind. They rig up some cattle prods and flame throwers and the hunt is on. They do find the alien but in the few hour that it took them to find it, the creature is now massive, standing around eight feet tall with long gangly arms, a long tail, and a curved elongated head. They alien's design is one of a kind, its never been replicated and will never be forgotten once seen. Systematically the alien kills the crew one by one until just Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver) is the only one left. The plan now is to set the Nostromo to self destruct hopefully taking the Alien with it. Thus starts the nail-biting final race to see if Ripley escapes or if she's doomed to join her dead compatriots. To say that the film is a masterpiece is a little clich\u00e9 but it's true. The atmosphere in this movie is astounding. I can't think of a movie that, quite-literally in some cases, drips with so much atmosphere. There are moments of pure terror unmatched by many films except for Halloween. The Alien is one of cinema's most enduring monsters along with the likes of Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Freddy Krueger, and his ultimate rival The Predator. I know I glossed over many of the characters but the less said, the better. The ending is of particular note, and my personal favorite sequence of the whole film, I'd even go as far as to say that the last ten minutes would function fine as a short film on its own, but I don't want to spoil EVERYTHING for those of you that haven't seen it. I will say that if you are looking for a ton of action throughout, you might want to stick to the first sequel \"ALIENS\", as this one takes it's time getting to the point when you actually see the alien in its full grown glory. And the scares do become a bit conventional and dare I say predictable once the alien starts it's killing spree. Characters walk off by themselves when you know they should stick together. But that's about all I can say negative about it. The acting, music, set design, cinematography, and lighting are all wonderful.  I'd give it 4 &1/2 stars out of 5. It just barely falls short of being perfect because of its own horror movie trappings. There are twists that you may not see coming, like one of the crew members being not what they seem and also proposed the question: Is the Alien the true villain, or is it the corporation that the Nostromo crew work for? Give it a watch. I can think of worse ways to spend two hours. And remember as the tagline for the movie says, \"In space no one can hear you scream\".",

There are some cool sets and the performances are fine, but in terms of a story or scares I wasn't getting much. I could maybe see why people were scared of this movie, but because I wasn't I was forced to look at more than just that aspect. I can commend this movie for the opening. The opening is good. But after that point it just barely rises above mediocrity by the actors and sets. The story isn't terribly predictable, but it's not very strong either. Overall, it's ok. It's not anything I would write home about, but it's not something I'll refuse to watch.",

            "content": "Widely regarded as a classic of both the horror and sci-fi genres, Alien is an incredibly dark film, in which director Ridley Scott weaves an atmosphere of isolation and dread that is all-consuming.\n\nAfter spending months in the outer reaches of space, the company-owned mining barge the Nostromo is finally on its way back to earth. Long before arriving home, however, the crew is awakened from its hibernation by the ship\u00e2??s computer, which has picked up a distress call emanating from a nearby planet. Though unsure of what they'll find, Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt) leaves Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in command and leads a rescue team to the surface. Once there, Dallas and the others discover an abandoned ship, which obviously crash-landed many years ago, and is now home to hundreds of strange, plant-like pods. Before they get a chance to investigate any further, one of the pods unleashes a creature that attaches itself to the face of crewman Kane (John Hurt). Kane is immediately taken back to the ship, where science officer Ash (Ian Holm) attempts to save him from the unknown intruder. But the damage has been done, and soon a deadly monster is loose on the Nostromo, threatening the lives of all on board.\n\nYes, Alien is well acted; Sigourney Weaver is impressive in her star-making turn as Ripley, the rugged second-in-command who initially plays everything by the book. Yes, the special effects are magnificent; the alien creature, which Scott reveals ever so slowly throughout the film, is pretty damned alarming. But what stayed with me long after Alien ended was its brooding ambiance, enhanced at all times by the movie's central location: the crumbling Nostromo spacecraft, whose narrow corridors and dark passageways prove downright claustrophobic. This, combined with a general feeling of separation that gradually settles over everyone on board, reminds us the Nostromo, aside from falling apart, is also too far from earth to call for help. Director Scott sets the perfect mood right at the outset, taking us on a tour of the ship before the crew awakens from its hibernation, the ominous score of Jerry Goldsmith, occasionally interrupted by the clanking of machinery, cluing us in that the Nostromo won\u00e2??t be anything like the pristine spaceships found in 2001: A Space Odyssey. In fact, this is the last place you want to be with a carnivorous alien on the loose.\n\nAs frightening as the creature is in Alien, it is doubly scary lurking around on the Nostromo. Not only did the film introduce us to one of the cinema\u00e2??s most memorable monsters, it put it on a ship that itself managed to give us the creeps.",

            "content": "Science fiction movies have achieved popularity for decades with some franchises that have kept a substantial fan following; one of these is ''Alien''.  It all started back in 1979 with an outstanding science fiction film that broke new ground and elevated director Ridley Scott to super-stardom.\n\nIn the future a band of space truckers aboard the Nostromo are journeying back to Earth towing a mineral refinery for the Weyland-Yutani Corporation when a distress signal is picked up by the ship's computer. Following orders from the company the crew sets down upon a desolate planet and come across a crashed alien ship. From there a simple exploration mission devolves into a bloodbath as the crew unwittingly unleashes a grotesque, demonic and all around unstoppable monster. What sets Alien apart from other science fiction movies is the slow and steady pacing of its plot; it takes it's time to establish the futuristic setting and technology which immerses the audience into the film before the main action begins. The same applies to suspense and the film serves as one of the finest examples of this technique; far too many horror films today utilise jump-scares and skip the suspense entirely but Alien makes great efforts to conceal the creature through the film. The fact that the Alien is not seen very often, combined in tandem with the claustrophobic setting of the Nostromo takes full advantage of the feeling of uneasiness and gives the impression that the creature could be almost anywhere, ready to pounce. On top of this the characters are at a huge disadvantage; they can't run or hide and they have no conventional weapons to use; they are forced to rely on each other and their own ingenuity, raising the unlikelihood of survival in an already bleak situation. Ultimately the plot of Alien is akin to a nightmare; the scares are frightening and unpredictable, the gore is hideous and shocking, and the futuristic setting is both fascinating and richly detailed.\n\nAlien's cast, far from the often under developed and lacklustre performances of modern horror cinema is excellent and for its time it brought together a well-rounded and professional collection of actors to bring the characters to life. These are incredibly developed characters indeed with every single cast member bringing their own traits to the table as well as making the characters quite relatable. Dallas (Tom Skerritt) is the capable captain, Ash (Ian Holm) is the blunt yet subtle officer, Kane (John Hurt) is more quiet and logical in his thinking, Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) are the everyday co-workers who like to banter with one another, Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) is the more timid one who quickly loses her nerve when the Alien attacks and finally Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is the strong and caring warrant officer who at the time of the film's release, redefined how women were perceived in films. What makes the characters so developed and likeable is again down to the film's slow beginning; it gives ample time for the audience to get to know them and care about their fates. Bolaji Badejo also deserves a special mention for delivering a truly sinister and disturbing performance inside the suit of the Alien itself; the way it crawls around, hides in the shadows and grips its victims as it comes in for the kill truly sets it apart as one of the most memorable movie monsters of all time.\n\nNot only are the characters highly developed but so is the atmosphere; it's all down to the highly unusual, sexual and mysterious set designs by H.R Giger.  The scene where the crew journey through the tunnel like caverns of the derelict ship and discover the huge ''space jockey'' chair is one of the biggest spectacles in science fiction. The hand painted imagery raises numerous questions that enhance the film's lore; what is that dead creature in the chair? What was its mission? How did the Alien eggs get inside the ship? It's a mystery that compliments the Alien itself. The Nostromo also makes an impression through both setting and sound; most of the spaceship is made up of narrow corridors barely illuminated by flashing lights. This environment is often eerily quiet and the few sounds we do pick up are often warning sirens or the rattling of machinery; it paints a gloomy and isolated setting where the characters are constantly being hunted and stalked. Outside of these scare tactics the themes of space travel are explored vividly with the technology being highly interesting but never interfering with the character's struggles throughout the film.\n\nTaking the basic premise of a B-Movie and elevating it to relentlessly terrifying professionalism; Alien, even more than thirty years later remains the undisputed king of sci-fi horror. Everything from the suspense, the characters, the sets, and the horrific creature at its center is masterfully executed to serve as one of the all-time greatest science fiction movies ever made.",

            "content": "Plainly put, Alien is an old-fashioned scary movie set in a highly realistic sci-fi future, made all the more believable by expert technical craftmanship. Picture isn't quite good enough to be a combination of The Exorcist and Star Wars, but both titles are likely to come to mind.\n\nScript [from a story by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett] has more loose ends than the Pittsburgh Steelers but that doesn't matter as director Ridley Scott, cameraman Derek Vanlint and composer Jerry Goldsmith propel the emotions relentlessly from one visual surprise - and horror - to the next. [Plot has several parallels with the 1958 lowbudgeter It! The Terror from Beyond Space.]\n\nThe price paid for the excitement, and it's a small one, is very little involvement with the characters themselves. But it really doesn't matter when the screaming starts.\n\nIn contrast to the glamorous, adventurous outer-space life often depicted in sci-fi, Alien initially presents a mundane commercial spacecraft with crew members like Yaphet Kotto bitching and moaning about wages and working conditions.\n\nThe tedium is shared by captain Tom Skerritt, his aide Sigourney Weaver and the rest of the crew, played by a generally good cast in cardboard roles. Eventually, it will be Weaver who gets the biggest chance in her film debut, and she carries it off well.\n\nSince they were doomed to get an R rating for gore, anyway, the filmmakers have thrown in some 20th century swearing for Weaver, which seems odd and awkward in the context, plus a bit of a skin show that's fetching but a little far-fetched.",

The one that took a bit of room was the Alien Quadrilogy. I've seen them before also, but I don't remember much of the films except for Aliens which I watched the most. So I'll go ahead and start with Ridley's Scott's Alien, which is a fantastic start. The cast is really great in this, and so is Sigourney Weaver. When people said that they know every character in this movie, I thought that they were just diehard fans on the Alien series, but they were right as I find all of the characters memorable, and the movie spends time on each of the characters so that we would know things about a particular character. The story by Dan O' Bannon and Ronald Shusett is very good, and I'm sure that it was original at that time. The alien design by H.R Giger is terrifyingly good, and it would always be one of the horror icons. The writing by Dan O' Bannon is well done and there's never a scene that was unnecessary for him to write in. I do like that the film not only focuses on the computer and green screen effects, but also on the practical effects like the spaceship for example which you can see the little details they put in there, and it looks like a legitimate place. Even though that the pacing is a slow burner here, I was still invested in the film, and the scares are very effective which got me even more interested. While Alien may not be the scariest film that I've ever seen, it is definitely the scariest Science Fiction film, and that alone is good enough.",

This little low budget film was made at the right time, and it started a massive franchise which comes and goes to this day. The first one will always and forever be the best. At some point in the future, the spacecraft Nostromo, which is transporting cargo across space, the ship's computer awakes the crew from a deep sleep statis to investigate a distress signal. The crew consist of Captain Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Kane (John Hurt), Ash (Ian Holm) and Parker (Yaphet Kotto). They go to where the signal is coming from, an alien spaceship with eggs on board. While Kane investigates the eggs, a creature bursts out of one of them, smothering his face. The creature has acidic blood, but when Kane awakes, that isn't the end of it... Even 35 years later, this is still a very engaging and suspenseful horror/sci-fi/thriller, which was meant to be a reaction against the wholesomeness of Star Wars, and something altogether nihilistic.

Throw in the mystery of space, a spectacle of Sci-fi technology, and deadly chest-bursting creatures; and you have the Ridley Scott film.\n\nThe film is a unique sub-genre of a (soft) science fiction- a thriller. Just like any thriller the story allows you to get used to the characters and get you on their side before hell breaks loose. Now Ripley, played by the talented Sigourney Weaver, being impressive and funny as the Nostromo's executive officer who manages to act tough, efficient and sexy all at the same time. This extremely likable character is the main driving force behind your sub-conscious feeling of wanting to see this person survive.\n\nThe world that we are introduced to in Alien is in a time far into the future where space exploration is a norm. There's cryo-sleep capsules, advanced suits that allow you to survive in the vacuum of space, and androids that seem so human it's near impossible to tell.\n\nThe movie is short which is perfect for this science fiction-thriller, a thriller going on for more than two and a half hours gets old quickly. The amount of momentum the movie has from start to finish is quite impressive in Ridley Scott's dark take on space exploration. You get a sense of progress and increase of momentum as you see the evolutions of the 'alien', and the build up of fear from the crew from being trapped on a ship with this deadly being. As the story progresses the crew is picked off one by one just as thrillers go, but good 'ol Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) keeps the rest of the crew going just off of pure grit and tenacity. Add in killer androids, the deadly vacuum of space, and near impossible scientific situations-you get the formula for a great Sci-fi thriller film.\n \nThis movie was the one of the starts to thriller Sci-Fi's, there were already films made that had these themes-but this film definitely popularized this specific genre. It gave us intense situation and different outcomes of what can happen in the dark vacuum of space, giving us fear of the great beyond, and many movies after followed in the same concepts: Interstellar (2014), and Gravity (2013).",

Alien had a chance to succeed thanks to a renewed interest in the science fiction genre with the success of both Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind two years earlier.\nThe film, set in the year 2122, follows the crew of the Nostromo who answer a distress signal from the desolate planet LV-426. When they get there, the ship takes damage and time is needed for engineers Brett (Stanton) and Parker (Kotto) to repair the ship. In the meantime, Captain Dallas (Skerrit), navigator Lambert (Cartwright), and Executive Officer Kane (Hurt) investigate the origin of the signal. They come across a ship and upon entering it they find a large amount of eggs. Each of these eggs contains a creature that has become known as a facehugger. One of these facehuggers attaches itself to Kane. Upon returning to the Nostromo while carrying Kane, Dallas and Lambert are denied entry onto the ship by warrant officer Ellen Ripley because of quarantine procedures. Quarantine procedures are thrown out the door when Science Officer Ash (Holm) allows them onboard. The facehugger detaches itself from Kane and dies. Kane wakes up and the crew decides to celebrate by having a meal together only to find out that Kane was impregnated with a deadly alien that gets loose and quickly grows in size and strength. Now the crew must fight for both their survival and the survival of mankind.\nScott seems to take plays out the same horror movie playbook that fellow renowned science fiction director Steven Spielberg used for Jaws four years earlier. Thankfully for Alien, they are the right plays. The most notable one being the scariest thing is whatever you do not see. Scott drew his visual inspiration from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and George Lucas' Star Wars while he has described the film as a science fiction version Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\nScott fought with the studio over his decision to let H.R. Giger to design the film. While the studio was against that decision, Scott still won that fight allowing Giger to use his imagination and in the end he created a stunningly beautiful looking style for the film. Every scene with the alien is filled intense atmosphere. Over thirty years after the film's release the visuals of Alien are even better than the visual effects in a lot of movies today.\nThe acting is also impressive. That is an understatement for Weaver's performance. Weaver was not known at the time like she is today, but she sure does own the role of Ellen Ripley. Speaking of Ripley, she is a character that I love. She is smart, brave, and resourceful. All of the characters are fun to watch on screen in large part thanks to some entertaining performances.\nAlien has stood the test of time perfectly. Though it took a few years to get a sequel, the film still became the first installment of one of today's most iconic movie franchises. Alien is a classic that perfectly blends everything together.",

            "content": "I wish horror was more like this, in an age where effects are thrown in for shock value, where the scares and moments are so formulaic, and whilst investing so much time in the formula, the plots are forgotten. With all the Halloweens, and Nightmares on Elm Street, and hell, even the Screams dominating a lot of horror movie talk, I think a lot of people in my generation forget about Alien, whether it be because on paper it seems like such a lame sci-fi film, or because you're just too young to invest in it.\nSo, on board the Nostromo, a ship in outerspace returning to Earth, are seven astronauts, in hyper sleep, when they are awoken by Mother (the A.I. on the ship) of a distress signal. Obviously, they are to be picked off one by one (see most horror flicks DO follow this formula). You can re-invent the wheel, but it's how you do it, right? Do you just polish the wooden spokes, or do you delight the world and make it shiny, maybe with a bit of Platinum, and throw spikes on it that throw out flames every 3.8 seconds? See, both accomplish the same thing, except the former is a fucking borefest.\nThere are two reasons, and very important reasons, why this movie not only works, but is absolutely outstanding, and completely deserves every iota of accolade it has received in the past 36 years.\n1. Remember how in Jaws, you don't see the shark until the end? How it was all anticipation? Nowadays we can predict in most horror films when the scares are going to come. When the monster is going to come out of the water, or when the goofy serial killer obsessed with wooden cooking spoons is going to come out of the closet and disembowel you. There is a lot of darkness, whether it be when Kane (John Hurt) is investigating the planet which the distress/warning signal originated from, or when Dallas is basically crawling through the ducts of the ship trying to find the alien. Those moments in the dark, just anticipating something bad happening, most of the time with nothing happening, just makes it all the more scary when it does. It's clever and perfect on every occasion.\n2. We don't know who the actual hero is until at least halfway through the movie. We know Sydney Prescott will persevere in Scream. We know Laurie Strode is the hero. We all know now that Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is the centerpiece, but not at first. Dallas (Tom Skerritt) would have seemed to be that person. He isn't.\nThis alien is no E.T. It's not even a gremlin. The design is perfectly frightening. It simply looks evil. Even as a baby (in a very shocking debut, by the way, which was completely unexpected in the scene in which it occurs), it looks diabolical. Hell, if Cujo was a puppy... Well, that would have been hilarious. Furthermore, it's not just a bunch of space people investigate an alien, one gets infected, and it goes after a bunch of people. That's not the plot. It truly is an allegory for our world's obsession with research and violence. It's never too gory, it's never just about scares. The film cares about its characters. You feel Ripley's anger, and her fear all at the same time, and how she scrappily goes through it all. Yeah it was made in 1979, and God willing it will never be remade into a piece of shit like other movies have (Texas Chainsaw, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, need I go on?). But holy shit, it's effective, and it's outstanding.\nIt's rated R. No kids. It's gory, it's scary, there's rough language, and a little bit of near nudity. It's violent at times, and children may have bad nightmares. But if you're in your twenties, and your toddler is in bed for the night, and you have a couple of hours or so to kill, pop the blu-ray into the player and turn the lights off. Remember that what you get out of movies is what you choose to get out of it. It's horror/sci-fi, and only sci-fi mostly because of its setting, and well, of course it's a creature feature. But the science fiction elements are neither too Star Wars or Star Trek, nor non-existent. It won't overwhelm you. It's about as sci-fi as Independence Day.",

            "content": "To say this movie is a good movie in relation to the \"body genre\" is an understatement. I got a very upset stomach when John Hurt's character had an alien bulging through his chest. I knew the iconic scene before viewing the movie, but actually watching the film made it affect me so much more. I also nearly had a headache towards the conclusion when there were strobe lights flashing in order to build the tension for the climax. This is strange and impressive because my body usually does not respond to films that much, even in the \"body genres.\"\n\nI watched this in a science-fiction film class, but we were discussing it and it is almost ambiguous as to whether this film more readily fits into the sci-fi or horror genre. The heavily black mise-en-scene would point to horror, but the ideas of aliens and robots easily puts this film into the sci-fi genre.\n\nThe pace of this film is very peculiar to me. On one hand, it is particularly slow towards the beginning of the film, which made it enjoyable as a faster-paced film once the conflict with the titular alien arises, but this fast pace almost skipped information in my opinion. What I noticed was that once the alien starts attacking the various crew members, the members would die, but then the film would quickly cut to the characters back at the safe part of the ship either discussing the death or holding something the character had on him/her right before they died. These quick cuts imply that the characters found the bodies and returned without trouble; wouldn't it make more sense to show them going to find the bodies to build even more suspense since the audience would question whether the alien moved on or not? Isn't it possible the alien would still be with the bodies?\n\nAfter a lot of exposition, a face-hugger clamps itself onto the John Hurt character, and while Ripley wants to leave him in order to follow protocol, the audience wants to see them take care of the man; all of the audience except me, that is. I know the alien needs to get onto the ship in order for the film to have relevance as a horror film, but I found Ripley's reasoning to be past logical - it's the only reaction that makes sense, but I guess we want to see people sticking out for each other, so the alien gets on board. Thanks Ash, you company man cyborg.\n\nOther than these complaints I have, this film does an excellent job at evoking bodily responses which makes for a fun, yet unsettling, experience. I can't wait to see what comes in store next when we watch Aliens next week.",

I love how this film brings suspense into scenes which generally leaves the audience staring at the screen....wanting to be told that everything is ok and that the character is in good condition, and if the character is not....then they will find themselves shocked, excited and scared for what is to come. I love how the xenomorph tracks it's prey. It is like a silent assassin that swoops from tree to tree looking for something to devour and kill. It is by far my favourite alien in any film it stars in ever. Ridley has developed a complete anatomy and a life cycle around this creature which is extraordinary. He has invented this being which has it's own species and adaptations and that to me is just pure genius. So, alien is a great watch for ages 10 and up and I do hope we see the xenomorph hit cinemas again soon!",

            "content": "The Alien franchise has greatly morphed over the years, but it's interesting to go back and see where it all started. The film is essentially a haunted house story in space. The colorful crew of the Nostormo take an alien creature back on board their ship which then proceeds to kill them all, one by one. While the story isn't all that original, the creature design by H.R. Giger are wonderfully imaginative, equal parts repellent and utterly fascinating. Director Ridley Scott also brings an enormous about of style to the film, elevating it from what could easily have been a simple horror film in space. It also helps that there's a stellar cast that includes Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto. Top it off with a great score by Jerry Goldsmith and you have a modern horror classic.",

            "content": "While Ridley Scott may be one of the most well-known and critically acclaimed directors today, in 1979 his biggest claim to fame was The Duellists, made two years prior. But when Alien hit the big-screens, Scott was instantly elected a genius, and it's not difficult to see why. Even today Alien is not only one scary movie but it is still a landmark in terms of minimalism, suspense, narrative and just damn fine movie making.\u00a0\n\nWhen a commercial towing ship's navigation system intercepts a distress call from a nearby planet, the seven-member crew is woken out of hypersleep to go and inspect it. But what they find in the bowels of a dismembered ship is more than they can handle. To give away anything else would be a shame, as it would spoil the film completely, seeing as soooo many people read my reviews. Right? Right? Anyway, suffice it to say that the next two hours are filled with amazing scene after amazing scene, shot with the incredible filmmaking style of Sir Ridley Scott and is still deeply affecting both psychologically and emotionally today some 30 years after its initial release.\u00a0\n\nThe minimalistic script is fantastic. Unlike most of the sci-fi's which came out at around the same time which were filled with jargon and gadgets, spending huge amounts of time on showcasing all the cool stuff that the props department could think of, Alien set its mind to creating a relatable world which the audience would have no problem seeing themselves in. Whilst the film includes supercomputers which control huge, space-going ships and, well, aliens, the atmosphere is completely terrestrial. People talk to each other like they're people, they open doors with their hands, they have to walk from place to place and there is a conspicuous lack of gadgets. In fact, the most hi-tech things you'll see include a primitive motion sensor and a laser scalpel. They even eat normal-ish food. Whilst these things may seem insignificant at first, they all add up to increasing the feeling of realism which in turn makes the shock hundreds of times more shocking. And this originates from the finely crafted script, specifically refined to seem less refined. There are no expositional scenes to help you know which gadgets are which and what they do, all that's there is the bare essentials, a style which fits the film perfectly.\u00a0\n\nBacking up this incredible document is a cast of fantastic actors. Leading the group is Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley. Though she might appear to blend into the background during the early scenes as it focusses more on Dallas, throughout the course of the film her character becomes stronger and more vulnerable at the same time. While she may be the ass-kicking badass in James Cameron's sequel, here she displays just a hint of that steely determination which she encompasses in the sequel. A perfect example is the quarantine sequence as Dallas, Kane and Lambert return the ship. Sigourney plays her perfectly throughout, balancing her strength with her weakness and the struggle inside her to keep them both under control. Ian Holm is incredible as the unscrupulous Ash, along with a fantastic turn from Tom Skerritt as the overwhelmed and just-plain-freaked-out Dallas. The supporting cast are similarly fantastic, John Hurt in particular, the proud owner of the film's best scene.\u00a0\n\nBut it's the look and style of the film, driven by its visionary director, which makes it the enduring classic it's known as today. The creepily claustrophobic feel which permeates the entire movie is something which many have tried and fail to replicate in their own works. Every single shot seems to have been perfectly crafted to find the most disturbing yet rivetting angle possible. Simple tracking shots in which nothing happens are somehow transformed to be stranglingly scary through Scott's inventive use of lighting and atmosphere. Where many horror films find refuge in the shadows, preferring to scare their audience with the things which lurk in the darkness, everything here is on display, well-lit and easily visible. Yet somehow, this only serves to make the film more real, thus more terrifying. Scott's reinvention of the sci-fi/horror genre is both breathtaking and inimtable.\u00a0\n\nIn the tradition of other signposts of the genre, Alien sets a high standard not only for thrills and spills, but for film.\u00a0\n\nDefining Scene:\u00a0\nThe Chestburster. A scene so shocking, visceral and downright amazing it has its own name.",

By the second hour, Alien has become a less-interesting, but still high quality cat and mouse game as the crew try to survive. Ridley Scott is on his A-game here and it shows almost immediately within the first 5 minutes. Set designs, that's definitely where \"Alien\" gets a perfect score because the eye picks it up so well. There's not a whole lot of blood, but the 'chest scene' was good enough. Nevertheless, between this and its sequel, I go with Cameron's \"Aliens\", why? Because I felt that the stakes were higher in the sequel and, thus, raised the the importance of stopping the xenomorphs from \"life\" and \"death\" to \"life\" and \"extinction.\" Also, Aliens' slow moments were still interesting whether it be the dialogue, the set designs, the suspense, etc [even Ripley isn't as great as her character was in the next installment]--and while Scott's film has all of that, the slow moments still feel slow. I wouldn't tell someone to skip \"Alien,\" but I probably wouldn't bring it up and suggest that they watch \"Aliens\" instead. Still, after buying it on 1/18/15 for $4.99 on blu-ray, I can't complain because I got my money's worth.",

It's not a true horror movie, it has some creepy moments, a few jump scares and is tense most of the time, but fits as more of a thriller than a horror flick.  For its time, it is amazingly well done.   It came out two years after the original Star Wars, and it looks a lot like it, but the alien itself looks amazing for not having a human inside of it.  It does look mechanical at times, but the large amount of slime and water all over it makes it cry convincing.  The face-hugger on the other looks like it is literally a living breathing thing, and and it's guts inside are perfect and basically real.  The acting is really good, and the script is even good.   It's not action packed, but not slow by any means, but tense and thrilling.   The ending is good, erie, and full of suspense, and sets it self up perfectly for the sequel: Aliens.   I prefer Aliens as the better movie; it has more action, more characters, better done effects and more realistic aliens, as well as a longer running time.  Something I don't understand is the preview to Alien, Prometheus.  It gives little insight to what happened to the 'Engineers' ship, and try's to answer questions we never had in the first place about why it was there.   It also doesn't even feature the original alien, and instead users a zombie, black goo, snake, and octopus alien.  It sis moly doesn't really belong, and I you haven't watched this franchise but think you have to watch Prometheus first, don't feel the need to.  Anyway Alien, classic, great movie, start to a famous and one of my favourite franchises.",
