    "summary": "Simple-minded Chance (Peter Sellers), a gardener who has resided in the Washington, D.C., townhouse of his wealthy employer for his entire life and been educated only by television, is forced to vacate his home when his boss dies. While wandering the streets, he encounters business mogul Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas), who assumes Chance to be a fellow upper-class gentleman. Soon Chance is ushered into high society, and his unaffected gardening wisdom makes him the talk of the town.",

It's implied and implied isn't the word , he flatly states that he's never left the house, it's his prisoner for being born dumb, Chance seems like an empty vessel, without even the capacity for love when he goes to see The \"Old Man\" dead in his bed.  But when Ben dies he cries, it shows that he understands death and lose, because Ben treated like an equal and a friend, and a father figure, not a someone that should be locked away and hidden. Ben was the father he never had! I feel like he actually felt love for the first time in his life, and with that anything was possible!",

Its a comedy of sorts - definitely a very dry comedy, not a visual, big belly laugh type of a comedy but I enjoyed it for being something a little different. Sellers does well portraying a slightly confused  and unsure person, someone is just...well, being there, although he is also seemingly quite knowledgable, someone who it appears knows more than perhaps he realises himself. The plot is, I think its fair to say, somewhat hard to believe but I found it amusing in terms of knowing more, as a viewer, of Chance's situation as depicted at the start of the film, so seeing people misinterpret him was certainly amusing. There is a definite element of social awkwardness present, often in relation to the upper social classes, which I found amusing. I liked this film and I'd recommend it to others, as something a little different. It has a surreal feel about it. I'd also say its a relatively memorable film as well.",

We were so glad we didn't spend the money to see it in the theater.\n\nYes, the premise is that Chance is supposed to be an idiot spouting simple phrases, and the idea is that people mistake it for profundity, or at least make these statements profound with their own wishful thinking. Yes, people can be fooled initially. BUT...\n\nAll Chance does is keep spouting simple phrases and otherwise staring out vacuously. And nobody gets suspicious? Worse yet, Chance is shown to have no feelings. He is completely indifferent to the death of the man he lived under for decades. We could laugh at the idea of idiocy being taken for profundity (happens all the time in real life), but there's nothing funny about someone without feelings.\n\nAs another poster remarked, Peter Sellers was evidently a worse psychological basket case than his biographies said.\n\nI decided to add a few things, in light of the surprising number of glowing reviews this movie has had. Of course there are always people who think a particular movie, no matter how bad it really is, is something wonderful and meaningful. But in this movie, I find that those who praise this movie fail to understand that they are the ones being mocked by the storyline.\n\nThe premise is that people who are rich and powerful are all taken in by the idea that Chance is a genius rather than the brain-dead person he really is. I was waiting to see how everyone was going to react when they realized who Chance really was, but that never happens. People who have gotten where they were through guile and ambition are so gullible as all that? Nobody gets suspicious over a man with no apparent background, not even any home or family? I would have found it infinitely more believable if the rich and powerful actually knew Chance was just a simpleton, and manipulated him as a front man, but that is not what happens in this story.\n\nAs for the claim that Chance was only misinterpreted as especially brilliant because he was white, and wouldn't be if he were black, that idea was made obsolete with the election of President Obama. He was hyped as a messiah who would work miracles, and as it turns out he is at best just another politician.",

            "content": "Before Forrest Gump used a similar premise for a more nostalgic and less subtle take on the same general character (a well-intentioned but slow protagonist that indirectly lampoons society around him through a serious of tremendously benevolent misunderstandings), Chauncey Gardiner made the world laugh and suffer from crippling secondary embarassment simultaneously. While very much a comedy of manners, Being There becomes a full-on satire of modern culture, media, pseudointellectualism, and personality, largely by letting Gardiner's very literal remarks linger in the air before being carefully misconstrued as worldly wisdom, with each slip-up seeming to spell his inevitable downfall but ultimately only reinforcing the perception of guarded knowledge. The film remains a poignant reflection on the myth of the meritocracy in modern society, taking even an intermittent stance on race that still seems biting. \n\nSellers' performance in Being There is absolutely towering, demonstrating that even decades after he had experienced the height of his popularity there was a reason for his initial rise. Most notably, the characterization of Gardiner makes use of Sellers' particular penchant for physical comedy but absolutely doesn't overtly rely on it - it's a demonstration of the accomplished comedian's true acting chops that sells the character. I like Dustin Hoffman in Kramer vs. Kramer as much as the next guy, but if you're considering the actual performances, it's hard to say that a comparison between him and Sellers in Being There doesn't lean heavily towards the latter; everything in this character is designed from the ground up with a purpose. (4/5)",

            "content": "Brilliant satire from the master Hal Ashby!\n\nDirector Hal Ashby's comedy Being There (1979) is a blast to watch and it just gets funnier and more ridiculous as it goes along to its resplendent conclusion. I was smiling, laughing, and thinking the entire time as Ashby splices together 70's pop culture and politics with a sly absurdism over how tumultuous these times were for America. Johnny Mandel's score even captures the strangeness of this era with his opening funk remix of Also Sprach Zarathustra.\n\nI appreciated the lush sets with such meticulous lavishness from the production designer Michael D. Haller. May Routh's costumes are gorgeous on the lovely Shirley MacLaine, who is hilarious as the kind hearted and super horny Eve Rand. MacLaine is a pleasure to watch her flirt with Peter Sellers and find a poignant heartfelt realness towards her love. It's also cool to see director Hal Ashby even cameo in the movie later on as the man by the cabinet at the newspaper The Washington Post.\n\nCaleb Deschanel's cinematography captures all these cute wide shots and a mesmerizing final shot of Peter Sellers walking on water with all his blissful ignorance, light as air. Being There is gorgeously shot. Don Zimmerman's editing is sharp and gently allows Being There to walk steadily to its pleasant absurdities for a quickly paced 130 minutes. The way Zimmerman cuts together 70's television into these outrageous montages is simply sublime as you get to see all the imagery and entertainment that Chance the gardener sees.\n\nWriters Jerzy Kosinski and Robert C. Jones finds the laughter out of obtuse, ignorant, rich conservatives who unknowingly take in a now homeless gardener played by Peter Sellers. Being There is a clever satire of 1970's conservative policies, government lobbying, presidential influence from special interests, racial dynamics, television as education, economics disparity, and American ego. \n\nHal Ashby shows how people only hear what they want to hear from Peter Sellers' simple minded gardener Chance because of their own narcissism and ego. He has no idea about what anyone is talking about in Being There, yet his words apply to everything in a hilarious display of good humor from Sellers and Ashby. Their words bring Ashby's striking satire to a warm and funny life of its own. Being There is certainly one of Hal Ashby's greatest films, if not his best picture.\n\nPeter Sellers beautifully portrays a man named Chance who stumbles through life with a dependence on the kindness of strangers as Blanche Dubois said, because he's mentally a still a child. Sellers delivers a heartfelt and nuanced performance that really captures the chaos of the 1970's both economically and politically with a more reserved acting than you're probably used to seeing from the famous comedian. He's hilarious as the straight man as everyone else is just crazy to talk to Chance, who they never really understand as Being There is a comedy of errors because Chance is so vague, everyone he speaks to hears whatever they want out of his meaningless dialogue.\n\nJack Warden's foolish Republican President Bobby is a clear stand in for the Gerald Fords and Richard Nixons of America with his need for conservative advice, idiotic manner, and strange paranoia. I enjoyed Melvyn Douglas' totally sincere performance as the conservative lobbyist and special interests millionaire investor Ben Rand. He feels as much Kissinger as a Dick Cheney type in hindsight. \n\nRichard Dysart is funny as Dr. Robert Allenby, who is the only man to understand who Chance really is in reality. You totally see how conspiracies, espionage, and paranoia grow as every intelligence agency and country wants to know who Chance is, but it takes the sole observant man to get Peter Sellers' silly normal man. Ruth Attaway's maid Louise sums up how only a white man could get by being illiterate and idiotic and still thrive in America.\n\nIn short, Being There sees Peter Sellers saying little, while Hal Ashby's film speaks volume on America's broken economic inequality and corrupt political system.",

With a screenplay by Jerzy Kosinski based on his own novel, the film stars Peter Sellers as Chance the Gardener (or Chauncey Gardiner), an intellectually challenged man who relates to the world by using what he has learned from watching television and working in the garden.  He is eventually adopted as an unofficial advisor to Washington's political elite, including the President, who see him as an intellectual with astute, albeit cryptic, views on the world.  Sellers gives a brilliant performance, the satire is biting, and Ashby cements his standing as one of America's great (but underappreciated) directors.",

I am so glad I came across this film on DVD after so many years. This movie is remembered as Peter Sellers' swan song, where he gave the performance of a lifetime. The plot is aptly a simple one; after the death of his employer, naive Chance has to leave the house where he lived since he was young. With limited knowledge of the outside world, only knowing what he has seen on TV and gardening, he is released into the cruel and relentless world. Fortunately for him, he gets involved in an accident with sickly businessman Ben Rant (an Oscar winning performance by veteran Melvyn Douglas) and his wife (Shirley McLaine) and they decide to let him live in their mansion. The Rants mistakenly think Chance is an influential politician (confusing his name with Chauncey Gardiner), since they construe his utterances and gardening tips as a profound, sophisticated critique of politics, economy, existentialism and the overall state of human existence. He climbs up the stairs of success to the point where he is bound to be chosen as an official presidential candidate. Then suddenly, he vanishes in a Christlike manner. Our simple minded Chance however, cannot seem to understand his position and does not really want to. All he needs is a caring home, a television and a garden to take care of. The novel of the same name by Jerzy Kosinski was a labor of love for Sellers, who adored the central character. After the novel's release, he sent the author a telegram saying \"AVAILABLE IN MY GARDEN OR OUTSIDE OF IT\". That explains the film's success. Peter Sellers, the chameleon actor, absolutely nailed the role of Chance, giving a superb performance worthy of an Oscar (unfortunately he lost to an equally good Dustin Hoffmann). Along with Sellers' unique and somehow sad performance, the film is driven by Hal Ashby, an exquisite director who is responsible for many thought provoking and bizarre films like Harold and Maude. Instead of making the film a clumsy story based on human guillibility and stupidity, he benefits from an incredible screenplay and gives the film a slow, winter like, melancholic pace. The supporting cast does an excellent job as well,  the score (Based on Erik Satie's Gnossiennes 4 and 6) is haunting and memorable to say the least and the cinematography is out of this world. All of these factors work together and create a very bitter and sharp comedy drama, whose themes are so profound and well presented that i highly recommend watching this one and exploring those yourself.

The story revolves around Sellers character as a naive and even moron man who finds himself adored for his intelligence.  Through the course of the film we see how he becomes a national treasure.  This is a Forrest Gump wanna be film, played with expertise by Sellers.  The acting is superb, the story is superb, the ending, that makes you fill in the blanks, yet, is ambiguous, is superb.  One of my favorite films of all time",

But the way the film is structured, and the way it cares for its characters and everything it establishes makes it transcend genre. However, this is also why I can't give it a perfect score, despite loving the film. I'll explain...\n\nNOTE: Upcoming minor technical spoilers, unrelated to the plot.\n\nDuring the whole two hour runtime, we're made familiar with the world and societies within the film, and we're made to care about every event, and for every character that the cast so brilliantly portrays. And then, for whatever reason, all that emotion we have built up inside us is thrown away by the end credits featuring a blooper reel playing behind them. I can't wrap my head around how anyone actually approved this choice. I'd heard rumors about an \"end credits scene\" not fitting the tone of the film, but I had no idea it was this bad until I actually saw it. The film makes Chance feel like a real person, and then they crap all over that by showing us Peter Sellers screwing up takes and laughing alongside an entire crew, right at the end of the film. I also thought the strange, jazzy \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" theme that played near the beginning was a bad choice, tonally. But that's nothing compared to the credits stunt they pulled.

Hal Ashby (director) seems to manage to keep an ongoing joke last much longer than it needs to, to the point where you begin to question if finishing the movie is worth it at all.  However, if you can stick around to the end, you will be left pleasantly surprised and feel surprisingly pleasant. Though different yet delightful, this film, with it's Academy Award and Golden Globe winning main character and Academy Award winning director, will have you thinking in a new transcendental way. \n Chance (Peter Sellers) is an unordinary gardener who has lived his entire life within the walls of his master's home.  All he knows is what he has seen on television, which happens to be his favorite thing to do.  When his master dies, he falls into the world unknown to him, that is, the everyday world that he has somehow avoided.  He is picked up by Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine), who, with the help of her dying husband Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas), introduces him to a world of wealth and power and politics, where his dimwitted, or brilliant, mind lead him to become a well respected and sought after man in Washington D.C.  \nAshby does not leave us disappointed with this film.  He captures this repetitive joke that men in powerful positions are easily captured by Chance's advice, even though he is an illiterate gardener, to the point that he himself becomes considered to run for presidential office.  Ashby keeps everything uncomplicated, however, just like Chance's character, as though the film itself is a representation of the lead role.  He also portrays each scene very simply, yet frames it as though it were a work of classic art, very beautiful and captivating, yet a little tiring after a while.  I have to say that Ashby took a bit of a risk with this film, after the somewhat recent release of Star Wars just two years before, the late 70's was all about Syfy and space, not  somber, dark comedies.  Even though the genre was not the most popular at the time, Ashby still managed to knock the socks off the audience.\nAs Seller's last work, he keeps you entertained throughout and enlightens you at the end.  His character is not the brightest of folks, yet influences important people from thinking he knows how to fluently speak Russian, to ways to run a country.  He is the only thing that really keeps you intrigued throughout the entire movie because you do not expect him to become as influential as he does.  He keeps you slightly on your toes, waiting to find out if his true identity and social status will emerge, leaving him back out on the street with only a suitcase and remote control.  Above all other aesthetic categories of the film, Seller's excellent and engaging performance most definitely steals the show.",

Sellers is restrained and believable, gliding gracefully from scene to scene with his eternal expression of mild fascination. The movie explores what it's like to be an outsider, to be lost in a world one should be familiar in, and the interactions he has with the other characters change him enough that he appears to be coming out of his shell, but not so much that he becomes a different person altogether. I wouldn't watch it again in a hurry, as I believe the pacing would become more and more infuriating each time you watched it, but's its more than worth it for the central performance, it's quirkiness and genuine niceties.",

Adapted from the 1970 novella by Jerzy Kosinski, the screenplay was written by Kosinski and the uncredited Robert C. Jones. The film stars Peter Sellers, Shirley MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas, Jack Warden, Richard A. Dysart, and Richard Basehart.\nDouglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Sellers was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role.[2] The screenplay won the 1981 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Film) Best Screenplay Award and the 1980 Writers Guild of America Award (Screen) for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium. It was also nominated for the 1980 Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay.\nBeing There was the last film featuring Sellers to be released in his lifetime. The making of the film is portrayed in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, a biographical film of Sellers' life.\n-Principal filming occurred at the Biltmore Estate, the largest private home in America, located in Asheville, North Carolina.\nReception:\n-The film opened to positive reviews and helped revitalize Sellers' comic career after he had starred in many movie flops, except for the Pink Panther movies. Film critic Roger Ebert mentions the final scene in his 2005 book The Great Movies II (p. 52), stating that his film students once suggested that Chance may be walking on a submerged pier. Ebert writes, \"The movie presents us with an image, and while you may discuss the meaning of the image, it is not permitted to devise explanations for it. Since Ashby does not show a pier, there is no pier - a movie is exactly what it shows us, and nothing more.\" \nSellers won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance in Being There. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor as well at the 52nd Academy Awards, but he lost to Dustin Hoffman in Kramer vs. Kramer. Hoffman, upon receiving the award, remarked that he refused to believe that he had beaten Sellers, or any of the other nominees. \nMelvyn Douglas won his second Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance. \nThe credits at the film's end roll over a humorous outtake, known as the \"Rafael outtake.\" Sellers was later displeased that the outtake ran because he believed it took away from Chauncey's mystique. He also believed the outtake was what prevented him from winning the Oscar. \nThe film is ranked number 26 on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list, a list released by the American Film Institute in 2000 of the top 100 funniest films in American cinema.",

Yes, sir, all you've gotta be is white in America, to get whatever you want!\" \n\nHal Ashby's adaptation of Jerzy Kosinski's novel is one of the most sadly underrated and often forgotten film of the 1970's. \n\nIn a film career filled with truly magical performances, it is here as \"Chance the Gardner\" that Peter Sellers delivers his best and tragically final performance. An entire book could be written about the artistry that Sellers' delivers in this clever satire of American culture and politics. This film also contains the last time we would see Shirley MacLaine actually play a character that is not some skewed form of herself. \n\nIt is unclear how involved Kosinski was in the actual writing of the movie's script, but it was never much of a secret that there was an uncredited writer, Robert C. Jones, who was very much involved. However this is undeniably a Hal Ashby film. \n\nThe movie offers profoundly comic moments without ever being an obvious comedy. It is a satire, but the film carries itself with a certain dignity that seems to oppose the idea of \"satire.\" As the movie quietly slips into a surprising turn of Surrealism -- the credits roll. \n\nI've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie. I can find absolutely no flaws in it. Movies seldom get this perfect. A must see!",

            "content": "After the film finished its title makes all the more sense, 'Being There', is a very different kind of film and the perfect goodbye from the one and only Peter Sellers. True, he made another film after this but this was the final one released in his lifetime and it shows us a side to Sellers that he hadn't shown until now; he was already a truly versatile actor but this adds another layer to an already impressive lineup.\n\nThe story of this film is very unique, even if the set up is somewhat odd. I found it odd how they leave the house pretty much the moment after that person dies, surely someone would come to visit the house to take away the body? And Louise just left Chance all by himself, why didn't those two work together to get another job or at least have her help him in some way? We see that character come back later on, with a few others, and all she does is moan about how he hasn't ever tried to read or write. But how could you if you've never had anyone even introduce you to it? Why had no one ever try to do anything about anything to teach this man? Why does he pretty much not exist? I understand if you were born and raised in that house you wouldn't even have a concept of the outside world, and even if it is explained that he has never left. Why? Although, I guess I shouldn't really ponder on that because its just one of those concepts that exist to get everything else rolling, and when he leaves the house, the image of what we think it'll look like on the outside is shattered immediately. \n\nThe way that everything unfolds in this story is very natural and it flows very well. At the start we see Chance watching something on TV where people shake hands and then moments later he has to actually do it, and besides a few other scenarios that aren't integral to the plot where this happens again, it was very believable, even if he did talk a lot longer than you thought someone would allow, especially on TV, about gardening. Although, saying that, I was still nervous for when he met the president and went on TV, Rand really had put a lot of faith in Chance after only having known him for a few days. The dialogue is excellently written and you really do feel that it makes sense where Chance ends up going where he does, as opposed to just getting there through clichés. It is also a very intelligent film, while I do feel the jabs at politics to be a nice addition as well as a nice addition to one of its themes, I don't think it was all that necessary but what I am referring to is all the little details that are just in the background, like the illuminati eye on the pyramid, the fact that he gets kicked out of a garden, eats an apple and meets Eve, as well as the character of Chance himself. Given the odd concept and the fact that I read something small before the film that a character was being kept alive by his illness, I thought this would dabble with fantasy but that wasn't the case at all, even if the end is rather ambiguous.\n\nPeter Sellers is an absolute wonder and while I agree that those out takes did seem to be a rather odd thing to watch, given how the film ended, but watching those really does highlight how much of an excellent and amazing job he really did. While I agree with the notion that once a film is over whatever happens next really shouldn't affect the film, but when it is something as personal as this, I think it kind of does. If the credits was just that piano song playing over text I think it would have added a lot more, while an actor stating that the credits are the reason they did win an accolade might just sound like they're making an excuse, although I doubt Peter Sellers' thought that way, I can see where they are all coming from. The Academy are known for making stupid decisions as well as rewarding those who didn't deserve it that particular year but give to them as more of a make-up, Hoffman was naturally great in 'Kramer vs. Kramer' and that film was a big winner that night, as well, but Sellers is on another level, heck, he deserved it for 'Dr Strangelove' as well as for everything else he ever did. I find it odd he didn't win the BAFTA either, however, another very deserving actor won it also, so it isn't all bad. However, like I have stated before, Hoffman's excellent speech that night quells any possible anger a person could have with The Academy.\n \nMelvyn Douglas, whilst sounding like, and reminding me of, Leonard Nimoy, was great in the film and I enjoyed his performance very much, even if I think the Oscar win is a little over the top, especially with competition, like Hoffman even stated in his speech; he is fine indeed, but as I've read, he seems to have won because of the sympathy votes, even if that is cruel to say. Shirley MacLaine was good too, I didn't like her character much at first, she kept putting her nose up at Chance but the moment he says he can do gardening she suddenly lightens up to him. The president had an odd introduction with him just wandering around the library uninvited and seemingly distrusting Chance, which makes sense, even though he used his quotes anyway. The cast of characters is certainly very memorable and they all stick out in one way or another. I thought that Allenby would have said, 'he certainly is' after being told that Chance was unique. And with the people Chance first meets, I bet they were happy he didn't put up a fight, even though I had expected him to not leave the house. I had also expected him to find, after that encounter a gravestone of a Rafael, but Chance was just using that as a waypoint. There's also a very odd reporter in this film that reminded me of Katharine Hepburn for some reason and she just stares into blankness after the light had went out. \n\nIt was nice to see Chance get so well looked after when he arrived at the Rand estate, it felt like he deserved it. You could just tell from Chance's face, and especially his eyes, that he is extremely tired and has quite a sheltered life, although the the wheelchair seemed like a little much and what happened to his things? His suitcase just seemed to disappear! Seeing him get by just by sheer 'chance' was really heartwarming to watch. And he called for a limo at one point and poor them because they just get forgotten about. The comedy in this film is very underplayed and dry, despite some odd moments with the line, 'have you ever had sex with a man', oddly coming out of nowhere, would someone really be that open about it before you even knew a person? And I had expected Chance to fall on Eve whilst he was doing yoga, in a scene that felt pointless at first, but the film never did that and kept it consistent throughout, it is a very unique type of humour that isn't exactly gut busting funny but is quietly humorous. Although I found it funny an English based actor said things like closet and Fall, when others around him said wardrobe and Autumn. There also seems something so wrong with Fred Rogers being on the TV whilst Eve ends up doing what she does at the end of the first bed scene.The film had smart use of music, especially when Chance left the house for the first time, but the editing was odd at one point, a character is in the middle of a sentence, it cuts to the president for a short moment and then back again. \n\nWhile I can't think of anything that could be cut, nearing the end I did start to wonder why this film was 2hrs and 10 minutes because it really didn't feel like it needed to be that long, I don't have a problem with film length and it never dragged but it did feel strange. It is sad that this was called the return of Peter Sellers and that this rejuvenated his career given that he had died shortly after, even though that sounds mean and I always thought he did a good job in films, but 'Being There' is a perfect testament to what a wonderful talent he was, and it really is great that the film was finally green-lit in Seller's lifetime. A truly wonderful film and a perfect way to say goodbye. Saying the film is underappreciated, including awards, is an understatement but that also adds to its charm and mystique of the little gift that awaits those who find it; a perfect character driven story that truly is one of a kind.",

            "content": "Subtle and brilliant, Hal Ashby's prescient comedy may've bowed during the Me Generation, but it packs more of an ironic punch and makes even more sense today. A film like Being There never happens by accident. The narrative and presentation prove so mannered that you begin to wonder if the writer-director himself shouldn't be afforded the same godly status that sometimes gets ascribed to the main character. Even his name, Chance, holds a great deal of wink wink knowingness, as an accelerated and cynical culture accidentally turns this seemingly simplistic man into a pariah. The film's commentary on media addiction and political spin doctoring perhaps grabs latecomers the most, however, pre-dating our current society in which we largely communicate and gather information and opinions through multiple screens. Even though it arrived in cinemas at the end of the '70s, the film earns a top spot during both the Easy Riders-Raging Bull Generation AND still today.\n\nIn this PG-rated comedy, a sheltered gardener (Peter Sellers) becomes an unlikely trusted adviser to a powerful businessman (Melvyn Douglas, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor) and an insider in Washington politics.\n\nWithout a brave and letter perfect lead performance, however, Being There wouldn't work on any of these meta-levels. Having an actor known mostly for absurdist comedy take on this one-note yet endlessly complex figure is brash enough. Pulling through with the apathetic mimicry needed to sell through this right-place/right time stooge is another thing altogether. Peter Sellers was called many things but genius is the one that's wholly agreed upon. His brash director, Hal Ashby, likewise earns this status--if not just for this, then for his entire CV (Harold and Maude, Shampoo, The Last Detail, Coming Home). Finding inquisitive angles to spy these goings-on while letting a lot of the action play out in long takes (with cinematographer Caleb Deschanel brilliantly helping to set the mood and tone), you get caught up in the hypnotic spin as much as the supporting characters. If it doesn't play well for every last modern filmgoer, afflicted as they are with a gnat's attention span, it's not Being There's fault for Being Square. It's simply too smart for some rooms. \n\nBottom line: There, And Back Again",

The overall tone is one of light drama, and it's only through its situations that it becomes a sly, witty statement on society, politics and pop culture. There are plenty of films that entertain without being profound in any way. Then there are \"message\" movies that strive so hard to educate their audience that they're unbearable to watch. Being There is a rare film that is enjoyable, but also a brilliant social satire that can generate hours of conversation. Being There featured one of comedy's giants in one of his best (and final) performances, directed by an excellent auteur. Jerzy Kosinski's modern fable gets a terrific translation to the screen due to his tight screenplay, capable direction by Ashby, and a marvelous performance by Sellers, one unlike any other in his career. The film will have you thinking and talking about it long after you're done, and technically it's above average, which makes Being There a fun and unique cinematic experience...\n\n\nVERDICT: \"High-Quality Stuff\" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD.

Then, through a series of misunderstandings, this simple gardener is lifted from the streets to living the high life. Chance, the gardener, is perhaps a bit mentally challenged but this is not a Rain Man type of performance from Peter Sellers. Sellers plays Chance as an extremely innocent character who is not necessarily dumb, just out of touch with how the real world works. This portrayal made me like Chance almost instantly, and feel connected to him as if he were a small child. When things started to go poorly for him I was having trouble laughing because he seemed so helpless. This was a combination of great writing and a pitch-perfect acting job from Sellers. After these opening scenes I was entirely on board with Chance and had some good fun watching where the story would take him. There was something familiar in the tone of this plot, like I've seen a similar case of mistaken identity, but it didn't annoy me or feel predictable. It was a very simple film that I wouldn't call ground-breaking or remarkable, but would simply describe as pleasant.\n\nThere were some good laughs in Being There, too. It's not typical slapstick or witty lines you might expect from a Peter Sellers' film, instead the comedy all lies in the unusual situations that Chance creates through no fault of his own. It has a lot to say about our TV-obsessed culture and how celebrity can be created through mere soundbites. In this way it is a story that feels absolutely current which is surprising when you look at the fact that it was made in the late 1970s. Then there is the final scene, which I will not describe because it must be viewed in the context of the movie to make sense, and even then people might struggle to make sense out of it. Personally I loved it. It spoke in a couple of different ways to me and it made me leave the film with a big smile on my face. That's not to say everything was perfect, there were a few rough spots in the middle of the movie. I didn't love all the scenes with Shirley MacLaine, possibly because I've never met a woman who can stand a man who is obsessed with watching TV, so I questioned her sincerity. It also seemed odd that they devoted a decent amount of time to a witch hunt and then completely dropped it later in the movie. The final scene with Richard Dysart was satisfying, but it felt strange that everyone else just gave up on discovering Chance's past. Yet, despite a few missteps I still enjoyed Being There a great deal, and would happily recommend it to others.",

            "content": "The great but problematic late comedian Peter Sellers penultimate film, which honors him an Oscar nomination and a second BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR win for the legendary Melvyn Douglas. Directed by veteran Hal Ashby and adapted by Jerzy Kosinski from his own novel, BEING THERE starts out as a farcical chimera, Chance (Sellers), is a middle-aged simpleton, a gardener who has been detached from the outside world for his entire life, and whose only recreation is watching television, after his employee's decease, he is coerced to leave the building and face the unknown territory, and satirically, his fate dramatically alters when an accident leads him to bump into Eve (MacLaine), the wife of a wealthy but terminally ill business and political magnate Benjamin Rand (Douglas).\n\nChance's distinct address, half-beat slower but concise, devoid of self-consciousness, over-calculation and circumlocution, plus a genteel comportment and soothing tone, earns him the trust of Ben and the passion from Eve. Ben is invigorated by his company and Eve is totally smitten with his innately deadpan sex appeal. Step by step it feels not like a ludicrous chimera anymore, Chance (now known as Chauncey Gardiner) meets the USA president Bobby (Warden) and is quoted by him to recoup the confidence of a sluggish economy, appears as a key guest on talk show, attends banquet with Russian ambassador (Basebart, his last big screen appearance), stirs a media craze for his zero-background anomaly, while America goes cuckoo for him, even seriously considers him as a perfect candidate for the next presidency, the coda hints us with a walking-on-water masterstroke to overturn our perceived opinion of Chance, a true godsend vs. a serendipitous irony (what about the Star Wars theme song playing when Chance steps into our society for the first time?)? \n\nEither way, Sellers injects magnificent dynamics and humor into the film, being perennially entrapped within the personification of an unworldly figure, a reluctant intoner, an illiterate whose taciturnity and remarks of horticulture is misconstrued as metaphor with profound sagacity, he never loose his equanimity, and the droll interaction with MacLaine, the libido-driven young matriarch, who thrills in finding an irresistible mate to live on when her senile husband is in extremes, is a wonderful treat for viewers. MacLaine oozes fabulous verve with her not-seen-very-often comedic bent, her self-gratification sequence is wackily idiotic but utterly hilarious. Melvyn Douglas is benign and gullible in eliciting agreeable sympathy in the farewell stage of a lengthy career, his Oscar victory may be a fruition out of Oscar's episodic respect to the elderly, it is more vicarious for the majority voters around the same age. Jack Warden's mockery of president Bobby's impotency comes on a bit too risqué as the first lady is explicitly needy and cannot stop grope him. Anyone sense a whiff of sexism? or even racism? The biggest loose end is Louise (Attaway), the black maid who knows the real identity of Chance, is portrayed horrendously as a hammy dissenter and never has any chance to be a true game-changer, so if Chance is really a godsend, and he must be sent by a god with a pair of colored eye-glasses, and don't even let me start on the cringeworthy homosexual slur.\n\n It is simply pitiful that the film is Sellers' last knock on the Academy's door for recognition, he would kick the bucket one year later at the age of 54 and one year earlier than Douglas (at the age of 80). Albeit some outdated and received ideas about controversial issues, all in all BEING THERE is a novel satire on media invasion, mordant and crowd-pleasing, a comedy with decent taste.",

Having to balance a somewhat complete lack of human connection and yet still fulfill it with the profound dignity he maintains throughout the course of the film is one of the most incredible accomplishments in acting, and only he could pull off, giving every intentionally redundant line of dialogue spouted from his character new meaning.

When his unknown elderly employer dies Chance is forced out of the only world he knows and he just begins to aimlessly walk through Washington D.C. In a freak accident, he is hit by a limo taking a parking space. In a miscommunication he finds himself going to the residence of an influential couple to get medical attention with them his name is Chauncey Gardiner. He quickly gains their admiration because he has such a calm demeanor and Chauncey quickly becomes a respected confident of the sickly Ben Rand. Chauncey even finds himself meeting the president and giving him sagely advice about garden work which is interpreted as an allegory for the economy. The pithy statement finds itself in the president's speech and there is a buzz about this mysterious figure named Chauncey Gardiner. This newfound fame leads to Chauncey ending up on television for an interview and the American public is captivated by his simplistic wisdom. As Ben begins to slowly die, Eve becomes even closer to Chauncey in her grief. At Ben's funeral, the president gives a speech and those carrying the coffin decide Chauncey should be the potential candidate for president. At the same time Chauncey is walking nearby in a forest by a lake and then in a final dreamlike moment he literally walks on water off into the distance. I think Peter Sellers should be lauded for his performance because he could be comedic and then play it straight like in this film. He is like a cross between Harvey and Forrest Gump with a love of T.V. I must say though that the bloopers at the end take away from the illusion that is created by the film as a whole.",

After smash-hit \"Shampoo\" arrived in 1975, Hal Ashby more than likely had a lot of pressure on his shoulders to create another witty film, and thankfully for him, this film might be even better.  We're introduced to Chance the Gardener (Peter Sellers), a middle-aged man who, for all his life, has been living with a millionaire.  But when his employer somehow dies, Chance, who has never been in the real world and only knows things based on television, is suddenly kicked out of the mansion, and, not knowing what to do, wanders aimlessly around the city.  By accident, he is struck by a car owned by Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine), the wealthy wife of Benjamin Rand (Melvyn Douglas).  Benjamin is ill and close to dying, but after his close ties with the president suddenly enter into Chance's own life, out of nowhere, Chance becomes famous.  If only Eve wouldn't develop feelings for him ...  Though it uses the whole \"two separate cultures come together-- and get along\" cliche, \"Being There\" manages to be fresh and endearing, most likely due to the terrific characterizations by the excellent ensemble cast, and satirical script.  Not only is the central main character eccentric (and played extremely well by Sellers), but there isn't even a villain-- instead, this film feels like a documentary, in which we're the voyeur and these characters are simply regular people.  Ashby keeps every second tight and lightly funny, but the more we get to know these characters, the more we like them.  \"Being There\" is a great film that features terrific performances.  Is there anything more needed to say?",

            "content": "Being There, Great Movies\n\"To see me as a person on screen would be one of the dullest experiences you could ever wish to experience\" - quote from Peter Sellers.\nPeter Sellers had many quotes like this in which he spoke of his near self-hatred, hated seeing himself, and that when he was not doing comedy, he was dull and unfunny. That makes his portrayal of Chauncey Gardner that much more amazing, because he portrays a very simple man totally comfortable within himself.\n*Being There* is a great film. It deals with a simple premise - if you act in a certain way, people will make unquestioned assumptions about you. Chauncy is slow witted and has the mind of small child, and all that he knows in gardening. However, he dresses in nice suits, has impeccable manners and is not shy, so he is accepted into social circles. When he speaks of gardening, his ramblings are mistaken for metaphors and he is instantly considered an economic genius.\nThis is wrapped around a beautiful film, in which Chauncey wanders from one circumstance into another, never changing his demeanor, never faltering. I an reminded of Mr Magoo walking blindly down a succession of steel girders thinking they are stairs. Essentially, he is not in peril because he does not know he is in peril. The charm of this film exists in Chauncey's unwavering personality, and how it affects the world of phonies and bureaucrats he has come to inhabit.\nAlthough the film sometimes comes across as forced, and some of the encounters with Eve (Shirley MacLaine) come off forced, the film is still a masterpiece. Its theme and Sellers' stunning performance lauch it into the catoegory of greatness.\nThere is much debate amongst the lovers of this film over its final scene. If you have not seen it, rent it, and draw your conclusions. Like many great movies steeped in mood and metaphor, we are left to draw our own conclusions.\nThe phrase \"I like to watch\" has become so famous from this movie - it refers to Chauncey's love for TV and the fact that it is his reference point for his existance. (Such has when he tries to click a remote to thwart off muggers). But there is a great deal more to Being There. It is a Top 10 Selection of 70s, Hal Ashby's best film and Peter Sellers greatest performance.",

The filming of Being There similarly describes any mood the viewer wants; it is profoundly sad if you want it to be sad, it's cynical if you want cynicism, whimsical if you want whimsy. The satire is critical without being mean (unless you want it to be mean), balanced between subtle and obvious, especially in its take on race in America, and even 32 years later touches on debates as recent as last week. Hal Ashby takes his time developing a sophisticated tone, even with sophomoric material, which doesn't rush to cheap punchlines or gags. When humor comes it's earned and not forced. While the film stretches a bit thin toward the end, with levels of obliviousness stretching to the fantastic, Being There is perhaps the only film that is as amazing, or disappointing, as you want it to be.",

Unable to offer more to a conversation than a few remarks about gardening, Chance ends up being a rising political star, as his interlocutors (and eventually the American public) treat him as the mirror of their own opinions. \n\nAll in all, I found BEING THERE an enjoyable film but no unmissable classic. The cinematography isn't memorable, and there are two exceedingly lame scenes of sexual humour.

Tonally, it starts out like a classic '80s fish-out-of-water comedy, but that soon dissolves into a series of sequences of people talking, none of which are particularly smart of funny or anything.\r\n\r\nIt's not a bad film, but nothing abut it, spare the final 10 seconds that come out of nowhere and therefore don't gel with the rest of the film, is particularly remarkable. Even Peter Sellers' supposedly incredibly performance isn't too special. It's not bad, but all he does is say every line slowly and with no emotion. It's about equal to say David Walliams' performance as the \"computer says no\" woman on 'Little Britain'. Very well played, but one-note, and lacking in depth.\r\n\r\nBut all in all it's not exactly a dull film. It sort of works at what it tries to do... a little bit, anyway. It's just odd that it's as highly revered as it is given that there's nothing special about it.\r\n\r\n6/10",

            "content": "Peter Sellers. That is all. Need more convincing? Being There is a dramedy that works on every level and touches many emotions. It is an unusual but incredibly funny and clever movie, performed and directed wonderfully.\r\n\r\nChance is very unusual, and has lived a very unusual life. Chance is slower than other people. From what we know, he lived with a millionaire his entire life as the gardener. He has never been beyond the estate. He only knows the outside world from what he has seen on TV. When the millionaire dies, Chance is forces out of the estate and to live beyond his home, but as fate would have it, he gets hit by a limo and is cared for by another dying millionaire and his wife who do not see Chances simple mind which will take him far in life. Now the comedy is pretty much the same through this entire movie. Whatever Chance says is taken as a metaphor and he is praised as a genius. It's an incredible story to watch a character go so far by talking about gardening and never declining an offer. It may seem like a boring premise, but Peter Sellers makes it work perfectly. Chance is the FIRST Forest Gump. But what I think is even better is how the story focuses on the drama more than the comedy, not trying to be funny and definitely not trying to shove a slapstick joke down our throat. Being There is not just a hilarious movie, and not only has great actors like Shirley MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas (won an Oscar for his role) and Jack Warden, but it is a thoughtful and touching story filled with a lot of emotions and themes to think about.\r\n\r\nThat's one of the best things I love about the directing in this movie. Like I said, Hal Ashby takes this comedy into a more emotional side and stays serious, even when it appears silly. The pacing of this movie and the way it's presented actually makes it look like a sad movie. There's not a lot of music in this movie, even at the very beginning we see a simple character in a very lonely and isolated place that seems so sad because the character is so comfortable. I could only imagine how different this movie would look if another director was reading it's script, but Ashby gives this movie a great philisophical and emotional agenda that gives an relievingly fresh feeling. The cinematography is great, with good camera positions and lighting, looking unlike most comedies would. The use of lighting varies and looks darker than one would expect. The set designs and shooting locations are absolutely wonderful, looking into the incredible masion of Benjamin, filled with servents and expensive pieces of art in endless rooms in the huge estate. This is a very fancy and greatly detailed movie. \r\n\r\nThis movie is just as hilarious as it is dramatic and philisophical. It's almost a reflection on society and how fooled and persuaded we are through media and politics. How people struggle to gain power by lying to other people, yet Chance goes farther than all and he only told people the truth. And when we see the very last shot of the movie we're forced to think of the movie in a new way. Because of supurb writing, directing and performances, Being There is a must see movie.",

As movies with mentally handicapped characters go, this one was superb. The character isn't hammed up. His happy, calm, optomistic personality makes him quite enjoyable to follow. And though he has very few real dimensions, the audience is not left wanting because he has many dimensions falsely created by the other characters.  The movie also has opportunities to fall into cliches but does not.  The only negative I saw in the movie was the last 30 seconds of the movie, they do something entirely unexpected which feels untrue to the movie, though it's not that negative because the meaning of it is so open ended, and the rest of the film is a complete story without it anyway.",

While out in the street watching TV in front of a store a car reverses into him and the lady owner asks him to come back to her place so that he can recuperate.\n\nThereafter he meets the president and his words are taken as profound statements on the economy and his life changes from anonymity to the most powerful man on earth. \n\nAt the end he is seen walking on water, Im not sure what to make of this as there is nothing to make you believe that he is the second coming of Christ or anything in the film. \n\nI did like the film, it was different and enjoyable.

Instead, Foucault believed that knowledge is not neutrally determined; meaning that what is deemed knowledge is only found within the inner workings of power systems-social, political, and economic.  My initial reaction to this claim comes with a kind of cautious optimism.  In general I do believe those in power are in control of what most will believe to be knowledge. However, although power systems can dictate much of what we believe to be true, I differ from Foucault in believing that they cannot take away from an objective knowledge that lies beyond.

The man had never gone out of the premises in his entire life and is now forced to venture the world he has only known through television. He walks aimlessly through the streets of Washington, D.C., where he is struck by a car owned by the wealthy Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine). When he identifies himself, he mutters, \"Chance...gardener\" but she mistakes it for Chauncey Gardiner. Eve takes him to her home where he is to convalesce, and because he is well groomed and well dressed, everyone assumes that he must be a man of intelligence. No matter what he says, everyone interprets it as a piece of wisdom and insight. The public begins to start having interest in him when he answers simply to the questions given to him; they all take him seriously even though all of it literally has to do with gardening. He even becomes a serious potential candidate for president.\n\nIt's been said that Being There was a film that Peter Sellers had labored to bring to fruition as he had been wanting to make it for about eight years, even making many of the more weaker Pink Panther films just to get money to secure the pet project. Luckily his patience paid off as what we get is a dryly-humorous piece of political satire. It's a very understated kind of funny film with Sellers' brilliantly understated performance at the center of it. It would prove to be his final great performance, as he would die a few months after it being released, and what a remarkable swan song it is. It's a film that is just as relevant as ever as the media continues to expand with the likes of Facebook and Twitter and all the celebrities who say things that make no sense yet many take seriously. This isn't the kind of comedy someone looking for a laugh out, in your face movie fan would want to watch as it's pace is a lot slower than those kinds of movies and it's a very understated movie as all the humor is done in a serious fashion. But those that love satirical comedies like Network or Dr. Strangelove, or if you're a fan of Peter Sellers, this movie is for you. Highly recommended. 9/10",

            "content": "Peter Sellers may have lost the Oscar to Dustin Hoffman, but his performance in Being There is quite brilliant. He plays reclusive gardener Chance, who until the death of his employer, had never left the estate where he grew up. As such all of his impressions of the outside world come from what he's seen on television, and upon leaving the estate, his TV-inspired words are mistaken for profound wisdom, leading to a stint as the President's counselor.\r\n\r\nWhen written down, the plot sounds faintly ridiculous, but in reality Being There is a rather poignant film. It not only features one of Sellers' finest performances, but also forces its audience to question just where we get our knowledge from, and exactly whom it is that we idolise. In a society that more than ever celebrates the overnight celebrity, it seems that this movie was somewhat ahead of its time.\r\n\r\nI must admit that it took a while for me to really find myself gripped by the story. Though Sellers' slow-talking, and humourously innocent performance impresses from the start, it wasn't until almost an hour in that I fully adjusting to the tone of this strange little film, but once I got it, I was seen quite happily through to the final scene, which is possibly the oddest moment in a very odd movie, and leaves the whole film open to various interpretations.\r\n\r\nShirley MacLaine also stars, giving a BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated performance, but despite one or two memorable scenes, is sadly underused. Also starring is Melvyn Douglas who won the Best Supporting Actor honour at the Academy Awards for his work here.\r\n\r\nOverall Being There is a sometimes slow but inherently fascinating film., and a must for any fan of the great Peter Sellers.",

I picked this one up blindly on a recommendation from a friend twice removed. In short, it's a film about a man who probably has the IQ of a carrot, and his adventure into the outside world for the first time. \r\n\r\nI know I laughed a lot. I also felt fear, oddly enough. Fear that Chauncy would be found out, that he wouldn't survive. I suppose that shows I cared for the characters. This film was great because you really have no idea where this simpleton is going to take you. And in a way he's along for the ride as well.\r\n\r\nPeter Sellers is a film legend though. A complete chameleon. He embodies the character of Chauncy. He definitely created this endearing child-like innocence in Chauncy. And Shirley Mclaine is a cougar in this one. Definitely one of Sellers best films and it's good to see him leave this world on a high note.\r\n\r\nOverall, it's hard to describe. A very special film for sure. I would hate to relate it to Forrest Gump because it's better than that and more than that and perhaps a bit less than that. The story is similar but more realistic and at the same time somewhat unbelievable. Perhaps it's part dark comedy, part socio-political commentary and part magical. In the end, Chauncy can do no wrong, hell, he's even Christ-like. And did Chauncy pave the way for George W. Bush's presidency?",

In reality, Chance would be homeless and begging for food within minutes, and everyone would see through his utterances in a second,  but who knows. Maybe that's just old cynical me talking.  Sellers is great, although I get the feeling that I should have watched some of his other work first (this is my first movie of his).  I did get a little misty eyed at the end, but that was really the only time I felt for his character.  Maybe a repeat viewing is in order.  In the meantime, I don't think this movie is as great as everyone says it is, but it was still an enjoyable film to watch.\n\n\nOn a side note, if the only reason Sellers didn't win a reward was because they put the outtakes in credits of the film, then that's just bullshit.

When the man dies, Chance is put out on the street with no knowledge of the world except what he has learned from television. After a run in with a limousine, he ends up a guest of a woman (Eve played by MacLaine) and her husband Ben (Best Supporting actor Oscar winner Melvyn Douglas), an influential but sickly businessman. Now called Chauncey Gardner, Chance becomes friend and confidante to Ben, and an unlikely political insider. Cast also includes Jack Warden as the President, Richard Dysart as their doctor, and David Clennon (The Thing) as a lawyer that eviscts Chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[first lines] \r\nChance the Gardener: Good morning, Louise. \r\nLouise: He's dead, Chance.

Everyone seems to fall for his very simple dialogue, which is unbelievably inane. However, Hal Ashby's direction completely covers it up by adding comedy and sensitive drama into the film and it plays out so well, we completely forget how ridiculous the story is. It is truly a wonderful film, filled with fine performances by Peter Sellers and Shirley MacClaine, along with fine wit and cinematography. Ashby successfully combines comedy and drama, a rarity in films and the only other time where it was this good was Billy Wilder's \"The Apartment\" (also starring MacClaine).

It's a dark comedy that came out way back in 1979 starring Peter Sellers. It was his very last film and his performance was one that many critics felt was worthy of an Oscar for Best Actor. Melvyn Douglas actually picked up his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this film.\n\nPeter Sellers was brilliant but I think it was especially due to having such an outstanding screenplay.  It's a classic fish-out-of-water story about a middle-aged, almost retarded man who grew up on the estate of a very rich, old man. Sellers (aka \"Chance\" or \"Chauncey\") was the gardener who learned everything he knows about the world from watching TV. He also never set foot outside of the estate until one day, the rich, old man dies unexpectedly.\n\nChance is forced to leave the estate in search of work, food, and shelter and quickly discovers the real world isn't quite like the one he's been watching on television. But despite his naivety, he just seems to have a knack for meeting and clicking with very rich and powerful individuals who have no idea that Chance has the IQ of a six-year-old.  They just assume he's really eccentric and find themselves hanging off his every word.\n\nEven though the movie is more of a dramedy, I still I found myself LOL through most of it.

As for Chance, it's a facade he unwittingly puts on, and it's a fraud that can never be unmasked due to the shallowness of every other character involved. As such, the rest of them hit the ground with a hollow thud, but Sellers is nevertheless sensational. I could forgive the absence of depth, and classify it as a jab at pastiche (not unlikely in conjunction with the final shot), but the problem is that it dulls the humour of the film. As I watched it, I felt myself dreading what I thought would be the inevitable unravelling of Chance's character. Thankfully, it never came, yet the dread remained, and I could feel little more than pity for this man whose status in life is nothing less than fragile.

It's also the sort of thing that I think only Peter Sellers and Hal Ashby could really sell and make work. It takes the right kind of touch to pull such a weird thing off, but I'm happy to say they get the job done. \n\nThe film is a journey of discovery, as well as a sharp satire about dependence on the media, and just how much it rules our lives. It's a funny film, but also a touch sad. It's also quite beautiful in a poetic kinda of way.In a lot of ways, it's kinda of a fantasy, though it's mostly pretty well (for the most part) grounded in reality.

That sequence alone is what had me sold on this movie. \n\nAll in all, a fine piece of work, but I'm not really 100% sure what I make of it.. It's odd, and I don't quite get it, yet it means no harm, and is pretty sharp when trying to make a point about life and society.",

            "content": "One of the best, most subtle, and endearing acting jobs that Peter Sellers has in his career. The thing that I like best about the movie is that Chance/Chauncey is absolutely honest throughout the entire movie. He never lies, obfuscates, or does anything else to cause the mayhem that ensues. Each person simply interprets what he says to his/her advantage.\n\nSellers plays Chance/Chauncey as a blank slate, a mirror in which each person he meets sees what he wants to see. Some see a simpleton. Others a cagey advocate. Others still a down-to-earth, cognizant politico -- and all these things he becomes because of how they see him. Chance doesn't change at all, but his situation is in constant flux as everyone and thing around him changes.\n\nSome might argue that the film is a bit long (2:10). While I don't find it overly long, I can understand the criticism as it is a quiet, slowly told tale that builds from a modest beginning to a life-affirming ending.\n\nHaving just re-watched it, it is startling how relevant the points the film makes are to today's society and political scene in particular.\n\nThe humor is subtle and endearing. There are only a few laugh out loud moments, but my wife and I had smiles on our faces through most of the film. The editing is precise and timely. The direction is fairly simple, but effective.\n\nSpecial Note: If you get to the credits and a scene of Peter Sellers on the x-ray table comes on, turn off the movie immediately. Sellers always hated the \"gag reel\" put over the end credits and I can understand why. The rest of the film is played subtly, with reverence and truth. The gag reel scenes break the feeling and pace of the film and seem totally off-putting after what you just watched.",

When his employer dies, Chance is finally sent out into the world, a holy fool completely without guile and friends. Falling in with an ailing Washington power broker (a frail but wonderful Melvyn Douglas) and his sex-starved wife (Shirley MacLaine), his quiet demeanor and simple observations are mistaken for sage advice by his new benefactors - and make him the toast of the town. Sellars last role is a joy to watch - as far from the slapstick of Inspector Clouseau as one could get - completely charming and quite fitting as his swan song. Director Hal Ashby's pace is rather slow, but it suits the material well. Evocative piano score sounds strangely similar to Erik Satie.",

He's known nothing but life within his employer's house for all his life. When he is hit by a car, a wealthy politico and his wife take him in, and they are charmed about his, well, simplicity. Chance the Gardener (mistakenly renamed Chauncey Gardener by the couple) doesn't say much and is obsessed by tv. The couple take his simple language as metaphorical dialogue. Pretty soon, everyone up to the President of The United States is wowed by him. Again, this could have been taken to slapstick double-entendre heights, but Ashby and Sellers play it low-key, to amazing results. Sellers is so good here. No wonder he got an Oscar nomination for it. This is probably Sellers' last great role (he made The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu after this, but let's forget about that one)",

One misstep could have turned it into an insensitive mockery of retardation, but Sellers gives a delicate, perfectly understated, and even sad performance that challenges his manic creations in \"Dr. Strangelove\" as his best work.

Film critic Roger Ebert mentions the final scene in his 2005 book The Great Movies II (p. 52), stating that his film students once suggested that Chance may be walking on a submerged pier. Ebert writes, \"The movie presents us with an image, and while you may discuss the meaning of the image, it is not permitted to devise explanations for it. Since Ashby does not show a pier, there is no pier - a movie is exactly what it shows us, and nothing more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n2   Sellers won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance in Being There. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor as well at the 52nd Academy Awards, but he lost to Dustin Hoffman in Kramer vs. Kramer. \r\n\r\nHoffman, upon receiving the award, remarked that he refused to believe that he had beaten Sellers.\r\n\r\n3     Melvyn Douglas won his second Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n4   The film is ranked number 26 on the AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs list, a list released by American Film Institute in 2000 of the top 100 funniest films in American cinema. \r\n\r\n[img]http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTonxDFT-QmOJuFTUeKpsPOa7xVLV1k9j7Y50lgHo8RvdFFMGdA[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by\r\n Hal Ashby\r\n \r\nProduced by\r\n Andrew Braunsberg\r\n \r\nScreenplay by\r\n Jerzy Kosinski\r\n Uncredited:\r\n Robert C.

Sellers had a way of inhabiting characters and providing physical humor like few could, and here he turns what could have been a caricature of a mentally challenged, middle-aged man and makes him as simple as a developmentally stuck child who has become accustomed to his environment. As such, when his mumblings begin being taken for sage, he gets exactly the kind of attention that a child could only dream of.\n\nIt might work as a serious drama, but it's much better as a screamingly funny one.

And we all think that they'll never be recognised by anyone and they'll never to well in life.\r\nThis film completely shits over what we've all thought, and actually gives us a simpletons view of how the world works. \r\nAnd strangely it shows us how simple the world is and how everyone over-complicates most things.\r\nThis is why Peter Sellers as Chauncey Gardiner is the angel (messiah) that this world needs to become the paradise it should be, hence the jesus-like final scene.\r\n\r\nChauncey Gardiner has lived and worked in one house his entire life just watching TV all day and gardening, never actually being outside the heavy doors of the mansion. Suddenly one day when the owner passes away he must go out into the world that he has only seen on TV and begin a life.\r\nBut when he is backed into by a millionnaires wife while trying to figure out how he is on TV outside a hardware store he begins a new life as a sort of Hero for dying sentator Ben Rand.\r\nFrom then on he becomes the most misundertsood man in history. All of a sudden when he does a simple speech about gardening to the President he is asked to write a book, makes an appearance on TV (which he talks about gardening on), people believe he has a medical degree and that he can speak Russian as well as other languages.\r\nWhich is a perfect examples of who these 'higer people' over-complicated situations and can't seem to see the obvious answer to certain things.\r\n\r\nThe films main strength was the fantastic mix of this extremely powerful message done very subtley and through constant humour throughout the film.\r\nThis added to the idea of how simple Chauncey was which in turn made the audience very unaware of the messages popping in and out in Peter Sellers character which equalled a masterpiece of a film character.\r\n\r\nFinal Thought: If you haven't seem this film yet and you claim to be a 'film nerd' YOUR NOT YET!!! Until you've seen it.\r\n5/5",

            "content": "From the opening titles featuring the jazzed up arrangements of Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra, you are somehow drawn into Chance's blinkered tv reality, Seller's portrayal being simultaneously empathetic and comedic, his own personality seemingly invisible as he literally inhabits the character of Chauncy Gardiner giving what was surely the ultimate performance in any of his films. \n\nThe plot itself is fairly far-fetched it has to be said, the simpleton gardener ending up almost as a presidential advisor and lauded by the media once he's taken in by a kindly but ailing billionaire. The issues it raises are intriguing - the premise of who being as important as what you know, questioning our perception of those deemed simple, the clash of generations, the often ambiguous nature of information gained through television, authorities and political authority in particular. \n\nThe closing lake scene wrong-foots the viewer, pulling the rug of certainty from under us and forcing us to re-evaluate everything we've just witnessed, adding another, ethereal, dimension to the film. At that point it felt as if Chance had undergone some sort of other-worldly transformation into the comedic equivalent of Eastwood's man with no name, allowing us to over-write our own narrative onto his blank canvas of a past. \n\nDefinitely worthy of a couple of hours of anyone's time I would say this is one of those must see movies. How Sellers failed to win an Oscar for this is something of a mystery as his performance was simply mesmerizing, a role he was surely born for. It has to rate among my top 20 films, one of those that you tend to watch again and find things that you missed on previous viewings, a true test of a great film in my opinion.",

            "content": "Do you know those people who are just uniquely likable? Maybe there is something \"different\" about them. Maybe they are unique in how they handle themselves. Perhaps you can't quite put a finger on it. But you know that their being different is exactly what makes them so... alluring to be around. \r\n\r\nI have a friend who has Asperger's syndrome. His name is Tommy. And you can just see from the way his eyes open wide when he talks that there is something different about him. He is as real and honest and unashamed as a human being can possibly be. And everyone loves the guy. He may sound a little different and smile a little different, but he loves life more visibly than anyone else I know. He is totally real. No pretense. No pressure to fit in. He just is himself. Do you know someone like Tommy?\r\n\r\n\"Being There\" is a story about this type of person. The man who is not intelligently able to live life according to the world's standards, and therefore, lives through his own mental scope. A real man. Naked of sophistication. Here, this man is Chance the Gardener (Peter Sellers). That is all he is and all he has ever known. Chance is a middle-aged man, approaching his late forties perhaps. Yet he has the worldly know-how of a five year old. He is not mentally retarded, but one can sense he was born.... differently. \r\n\r\nFrom the time he was born, Chance has lived in a small townhouse in Washington D.C., helping the \"old man\" upstairs by tending to his courtyard garden. Chance watches TV when he is not gardening and is fed by Louise the maid, who has long known about Chance's mental condition. He wears the old man's clothes, very nice tailored suits that are just a tad too short at the ankles. But Chance does not care. He does not even detect this fashion faux-pas. Pants are pants. And that is all he needs. \r\n\r\nThe old man dies. Chance has no idea what this means. Louise tells him the news, but Chance can't comprehend its magnitude. He sits, stone-faced, and waits for Louise to finish. Then he returns to watching TV. Eventually, attorneys visit the estate and inform Chance he must leave because the house does not technically belong to him. He leaves, wearing a nicely tailored suit. He has never seen the city before. And he does not understand its citizens. \r\n\r\nWhen an auto-accident sidelines the gardener, the wife (Shirley MacLaine) of a decrepit millionaire (Melvyn Douglas) invites Chance back to their mansion to recuperate. A misunderstanding between the two gives her the impression that Chance is a reputable, upper-class gentleman. We know he is just a gardener. But Chance, of course, does not even know the difference. He keeps being himself. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the story involves Chance's friendship with the dying millionaire, his hilariously one-sided relationship with Eve Rand (MacLaine), and his incredible rise to fame as an optimistic economist with shrewd political advice. His simple stories on gardening are mistaken as metaphors for how to \"uproot\" the \"withering\" economy and \"plant\" new \"seeds\" of opportunity. He is interpreted as a genius by Washington's elite. And Louise sits in her armchair back home, jaw dropped, knowing that Chance can't even read, write, or spell his own name.\r\n\r\nThe film was directed by Hal Ashby in 1979, one year before Peter Sellers died. This was the comedic titan's last film, and he creates a character that is totally at rest with his being. Through Sellers' tight-lipped, monotone performance, Chance the Gardener becomes Chauncey Gardiner, a man of high class and esteemed intelligence. In reality, Chance only regurgitates what others tell him. Not only does this boost his company's confidence, but it reaffirms Chauncey as a superior judge of what is right and what is wrong. He, essentially, becomes a mirror through which all those who interact with him place their own varying interpretations onto the man's identity. He is exactly what everyone wants him to be. \r\n\r\nAnd yet, at the same time, Chance is Chance. He never strays from being himself. He is a paradox of identity: a man of many identities placed on him by many people as well as a man with a foundational identity of his own. This makes things very interesting, sometimes funny, and often quite sad. \r\n\r\nI watched this film and felt as if I was watching something sacred. Yes, holy. Spiritually profound. However you want to put it. The film moves with a soft respect for its characters and the genuineness of their dialogue. Something about the film just felt.... real. Real like Chance. Real like everything was being honest. And I was not watching any pretense. In fact, I was watching the guise of humanity being stripped away. Layer by layer. Until, at a certain point, I hit the yellow yoke. The stuff of realness. I can't explain it any other way. \r\n\r\nThe ending scene will inspire something in you. It is not earth-shattering. In fact, it is subtle. And it makes total sense as well. Chance is not like you and me. We look at him and see him differently, to put it nicely. The truth is that we think of him as possessing lesser intelligence. But maybe intelligence is not the most enviable thing. Maybe simply being at rest with oneself is sufficient. Maybe that is even farther along on the evolutionary timeline than we care to admit. Could it be that Chance is more advanced, in his simplicity, than we are? The man is an enigma. And the last scene confirms this. Like another who came before him, he is not really of this world. Yet he continues to walk it in his own way. Guileless, ignorant, curious, and at peace. \r\n\r\nNow I understand Tommy a little better. And I hope I can catch up to him one day.",

In a way that seems all to appropriate for man with the same man, Chance stumbles into the life of Eve (Shirley MacLaine) and Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas). From here, \"Chauncey Gardiner\", as he comes to be known, is thrust into the national spotlight and the inner circle of Washington, D.C. society following his encounter with the President (Jack Warden), who thinks him an economic genius.\nThe story, adapted from a novel of the same name by Jerzy Kosinski, is truly one of a kind and powerful in a very subtle way. \nDouglas won his second and last Academy Award (for Best Supporting Actor) for playing the extravagantly wealthy, influential businessman Ben Rand, who opens the world to Chance.

However, towards the end, hal ashby just turns the notch a bit too high and uses too many symbolisms to get his message across. A less over-the-edge end would have been nice.",

            "content": "\"Life is a state of mind.\" With these words, and a remarkable, ambiguous image, BEING THERE ends. It begins in a similarly ambiguous fashion: Chance (Peter Sellers), a simple-minded gardener, is told that the old man for whom he works, and in whose house he has lived his whole life, has died, and he is ultimately sent out into the world with a change of clothes and a TV remote. He finds his way into the home of Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas), a dying billionaire and political mover and shaker who is immediately taken by the serene Chance, as is his wife Eve (Shirley MacLaine). Chance (mistakenly dubbed \"Chauncey Gardiner\" due to a misunderstanding) soon is rubbing shoulders with the President (Jack Warden), whom he impresses with his gardening-related wisdom, which is taken to be an allegory for the country's political troubles. He soon becomes a nationwide celebrity, all the while remaining blissfully unaware of the guru status he has attained.\n\nSuch an idea would collapse without a virtuoso performance in the role of Chance, and Sellers delivers; he earned wide praise for his performance here, and his death less than a year after BEING THERE's release cut short what seemed to be a second renaissance for his career. Chance must be completely seamless in his nature, and moments like the one early on where Chance responds to a street tough's threats by trying to \"change\" the situation with his remote exemplify his unique nature. Sellers never overplays his hand, giving Chance just enough warmth to make him sympathetic, while maintaining a veil of aloofness. He's truly winning.\n\nMacLaine is equally good, and Eve's growing love for Chance, which could come off as absurd, is instead very touching; MacLaine has an air of intelligent ambiguity not which makes her Eve the perfect fit for Sellers' Chance. Melvyn Douglas won an Oscar for his role as Ben Rand, and while I don't really see what the Academy saw in the role (especially since he was up against Robert Duvall in APOCALYPSE NOW), he does just fine. Jack Warden, as the President, doesn't really have much to do (a brief subplot suggests the stress of his job has led to impotence; this is completely extraneous), while Richard Dysart rounds out the main cast nicely as Ben's doctor--the only person in the Rand household who suspects Chance is not what they make him out to be.\n\nHal Ashby's direction is a bit sluggish, and at 130 minutes, the film is a good 20 minutes too long; there are a few too many scenes of people mistaking Chance for a wise man, or of people trying, vainly, to uncover the background of \"Chauncey Gardiner\". The film has some nice, painterly images, courtesy of Caleb Deschanel, but the pacing makes the going a bit tough at times--surprising, given that Ashby was a former editor. The script was adapted by Jerzy Kosinski and Robert C. Jones from Kosinski's novella, and despite the clever premise and solid dialogue, there is a bit too much fat here.\n\nDespite overlength, BEING THERE is a beguiling film which gives Peter Sellers one of his best showcases, and never jabs too sharply with its satire. It's a perfect film to unwind with when action and adventure don't fit the bill.",

Peter Sellers esta bien, pero tambien me molesta el que casi ni este actuando, si otro actor hubiera hecho el mismo papel con el mismo resultado, no se hablaria de la actuacion, sino solo del personaje carismatico, pero por ser Petter Sellers, decimos que esta extraordinario?

However within that realization shows that the ultimate joke is on us because there are so many subtle nuances of this behavior that reflects on how we are with the television and how we reflect on it to have some deep essential meaning at times when its just mindless escapist entertainment and in moments where there are deep meanings we easily gloss over it as if it never existed a scenes in which Chance walks through the impovershed neighborhood outside of the garden he tended is a perfect example of this.\r\n\r\nThe movies pacing is slow, very slow for a comedy but the speed fits this movie perfectly as it allows for these pieces both physically in the actors performances and visually in the settings in which Chance passes through to show that \"Being There\" is just that, being there in that moment and sometimes waiting to see how it develops.",

His literal take on everything (anything!) is taken by everyone as brilliant metaphors and philosophy that in turn makes him famous. Even the President of USA takes his advice. Everyone loves him, every guy wants to be his best friend, every girl wants to be with him, including the wonderful Shirley MacLaine. He makes everyone's life brighter. He doesn't care, he just wants to watch TV.\r\n\r\nBut nobody knows this mysterious Chauncey. He has no background. CIA thought that FBI erased this man's history deliberately. FBI thought that CIA did that.\r\n\r\nSeeing it now, we might probably take \"Being There\" as a precursor to \"Forrest Gump,\" only less broad and much more subtle. It is amazing that Sellers manages to captivate us while delivering his lines in monotone. Maybe it's because the script and the direction are that great, which  admittedly they are. But it also shows how amazing an actor Sellers is.\r\n\r\nSee it if you can (buy the DVD, download the movie, just see it), you'll laugh over the absurdity of it all, you'll cry over its tenderness.

In my opinion, Chance, Sellers' character, may be an example of the grateful dead.  Large portions of the film were made in and around the Biltmore Estate in Asheville NC.  Sort of movie I could imagine being shown in film school.  Tag line at end is \"Life is a State of Mind.\"  I mean really, life's a garden dig it.

            "content": "With the arrival of alternative comedy at the end of the 1970s, it was tempting to write off Peter Sellers as a complete comedy has-been. But in the midst of seeming obsolete, and suffering from various health problems, he produced one of his very best performances in Hal Ashbys Being There.\r\n\r\nOne of the strange things about Sellers performance is that it is strangely un-comedic  or at least, its not the sort of comedy we have come to expect from Sellers. There is none of the outrageous characterisation of The Goon Show, or any of the farcical slapstick of The Pink Panther series. This is much, much more subtle, and as a result it is tempting to see Sellers as playing the straight man, in one great admission that he was no longer funny. But this just adds to the sense of ambiguity which flows throughout the film.\r\n\r\nTwo examples of this are to be found at opposite ends of the film. Firstly, near the start, with the meeting with the President of the United States. Its a perfect example of both Chances childlike naivety, and of the willingness of the other characters to accept his words of wisdom. Where does the comedy lie? Are we supposed to laugh as Chance for being an idiot, for saying things which are completely out of context and meaningless in everyday life? Or it is a satire on the gullibility of the sane, rational, normal people who are endlessly searching for meaning in this life and will hence belief anything? The greatest masterstroke of this film is that it can be enjoyed as both a light-hearted portrait of the stupid and simple, and as a much-deeper piece of social commentary, which pokes fun at and questions the values our society holds dear. In many ways, Forrest Gump owes its biggest debt to this film.\r\n\r\nThe second example is the famous final shot of Chance wandering from his masters funeral and then walking on water. This is a scene which has caused much debate since the films release. Some have claimed that Chance is a Christ figure, and that the film is an allegory of the Christian story before the build-up to the resurrection. It raises the question that if Christ came back into our society today, would we recognise him? Would we accept him as the Messiah, or would be reduce him to a flavour-of-the-month celebrity? Others have claimed the opposite, saying that he is walking on a submerged pier, or that the film simply gave up because it couldnt think of a proper ending.\r\n\r\nAll and none of these are true. As Roger Ebert explained in his review, the film shows us an image, rather than an explanation for the image. We can dispute its meaning, but we cannot offer our own reasoning which explains the image away. Just as the ending of 2001 cannot just be written off as Stanley Kubrick giving up because he couldnt think of a way to put the original story on screen, so the ending to Being There is part of its very essence. It is the very nub of what the film means: do we really know anything about anyone? Or, more to the point, can we know?\r\n\r\nSellers performance, which is easily his best since The Magic Christian, is complimented beautifully by Melvyn Douglas as the ailing tycoon and Shirley MacLaine as his wife. They provide the ideal starting point from which Chances influence can inadvertently spread, with MacLaine seeking a new outlet for her capacity to love and Douglas looking for a companion to ease him into death. And while the speed at which Chance becomes a celebrity is a little contrived, one has to accept it in the end as a necessary evil in condensing the novel for the screen.\r\n\r\nThe film is not a masterpiece, or if it is, it is a flawed one. Ebert has written before about the scene in which MacLaine expresses her love to an otherwise engaged Sellers, which is not completely unnecessary but is perhaps overdone for the sake of pandering to an audience. It is a mistimed attempt at eye candy or comic relief which sits at odds which much that precedes or follows it.\r\n\r\nThe other real fly in the ointment is that the film doesnt develop the character of Chances guardian nearly enough. In her final scene of the film, sitting in an old folks home and watching him on television, she is one of the few people in the film to see him as a fraud. Depending on your interpretation, she is either blind to his real nature through her cynicism, or is seeing the truth (or neither  she may just have missed the point in a whole other way). Unfortunately the film does not develop this scene, and chooses instead to wrap it up quickly with a cheap shot about racial politics. We never see her again and thats a shame.\r\n\r\nDespite these two blemishes, Being There is a poignant, bittersweet comedy which offers its audience both food for thought and light relief. Its a great mix of comedy and intellect, demonstrating that comedies can be about something rather than just a loose conglomeration of jokes. In many ways, this is like a lighter, more relaxed version of Monty Pythons Life of Brian. Neither are the creative peak of their stars (The Magic Christian and Holy Grail respectively), but both are great comedies which manage to be funny while making very serious points about religion, power, and the way that societies work. Had Sellers not died, he could well have gone on to an autumnal renaissance in his career, winning a Golden Globe for his performance and being both Oscar- and BAFTA-nominated. Disregarding his last two films, which do him no justice at all, Being There is a very fitting farewell.",

Being There begs to be watched again and again. For me, Sellers is brilliant in the role of Chance - his reserved manner the perfect conclusion to his own career.

All for the sake of satire, but not so much for the movie. Chance is a quarter-wit who has just stepped into the outside world after a quiet life of TV and gardening. He is adopted by a billionaire/close acquaintance to the president, which spins him into a mysterious political spotlight. The profundities which he speaks are cringe worthy, as they are just him repeating how to garden. Everyone takes his notions as optimistic metaphors for the economy and so the ridiculous encounters continue. Instead of devolving into a comedy, but avoiding any awkward drama, the film drags on as a machine for mocking the politicians, press, and public.\n\nThe ending was a surrealistic but unexpected high note. Showing Chance in a private moment, unwittingly performing a Christ-like act was something that warped the idea of the movie I thought. The interpretations are many, including idolizing the simple mind or taking a jab at the most famous version of Chance the Gardener. In any case it was an odd ending for a movie that had been a straight-forward satire up to then. Solid, but I don't get the hype over it. Great satires are hard to come by I guess.",

The name defines his character. He only knows of the outside world by TV, as he is protected his entire life from it because of his lack of mental abilities to relate in all but the simplest terms, usually discussing his garden. He is suddenly uprooted and by chance is exposed to another wealthy family that takes him in. His lack of communication is assumed to a hidden brilliance and wisdom. His honest unassuming nature allows others to project what they want to see: satirist, economist, con-man, and loyal ally. \r\n\r\nThe film progresses to bigger themes about how power is accumulated and held and those that might really pull those strings.

What emerges is a truly witty and triumphant story.Being There allows us to look at what we have become as a society and tears down the ladders we are expected to climb. What is left is a revealing look at the common denominator and the math involved in obtaining it. Along the way, it becomes clear that friendship, understanding and love are unaffected by the simplicity of one's actions. Indeed, we find that it sprinkles the pathway with a chance to read one's intent not through words, but by thinking, searching one's eyes and trusting our instincts.\n\nPeter Sellers is deeply entrenched in a character that may be the hardest role for someone of his intellect, oratory gifts, and physical presence to inhabit. I am not sure that I have ever seen a film that so brilliantly uses reactions as a major part of the script. This also makes for hilarious what if scenarios. Sellers talent for this goes without saying. He is joined by an impressive array of old Hollywood talent who compliment his every gesture.\n\nMelvyn Douglas rightfully earned the Oscar for his portrayal of Benjamin Rand, somewhat of a J. Paul Getty industrialist who has one foot in the grave and the President's ear as well. Shirley MacLaine is wonderful as Eve, Rand's devoted but antsy wife. Ms. MacLaine is always a good bet to take over any film she is cast in, and she steals several scenes. In one, she leaves us rolling on the floor laughing.\n\nJack Warden builds a role as the crafty and cranky President into a fine performance. Initially, it appeared that he would be used sparingly, but his subsequent scenes were very good. Ruth Attaway portrays Louise, a woman burdened by the truth, yet rightfully embittered by it. Richard Dysart provides intrigue as the skeptical Doctor Allenby.\n\nBeing There was directed by Hal Ashby. He was afforded an excellent script, cast, and crew. I think one of the reasons that great actors require great directors is due to their immersion into their roles. Mr. Ashby had the ability, as they say in sports, to see the whole field. It was an essential ingredient to making this a classic film. The movie was filmed in 1979, and there is much to date it. Yet, the core elements are timeless.\n\nThe movie is now on Blu-ray. There are a few extras, such as memories of the filming, an alternate ending and deleted scenes. It does look nice, but do not expect the normal HD experience. It was filmed almost 30 years ago. However, I sent this to the top of my Netflix list on the strength of its story. That and a message that I need to be reminded of from time to time when life seems absurd. This is a garden of earthly delights and one that makes being there special",

It just works on so many levels, provided of course you know what you're getting. It's a slow, steady, subtle and masterful satire. For those looking for intricate plots or belly laughs, this won't be the film for you. For those looking for insightful (IMHO) social satire, definitely worth a watch.\n\nI may perhaps be overthinking the film, but it seems remarkably insightful on so many levels. For example, is Chance supposed to only represent a simple blank slate upon which the more \"sophisticated\" project themselves and therefore mistakenly (and ironically) take him to be one of their own? Or is he intended to represent the Shakespearean fool who, although appearing as a simpleton, has insight beyond the kings and kingmakers? \nThe first was my initial interpretation of the film, but on seeing it again, I wonder whether the second might be more accurate.\n\nEven the poster and the manner in which Chance is dressed is reminiscent of Magritte's Golconda and it's theme (I think) about the treachery of images or representations.\n\nOr maybe the irony is me overthinking a simple movie about a simpleton's life. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, Shirley MacLaine is hot.",

Identifying himself, the confused man mutters \"Chance...gardener,\" which Eve takes to be \"Chauncey Gardiner.\" Eve takes him to her home to convalesce, and because Chance is so well-dressed and well-groomed, and because he speaks in such a cultured tone, everyone in her orbit assumes that \"Chauncey Gardiner\" must be a man of profound intelligence. No matter what he says, it is interpreted as a pearl of wisdom and insight. He rises to the top of Washington society, where his simplistic responses to the most difficult questions (responses usually related to his gardening experience) are highly prized by the town's movers and shakers. In fact, there is serious consideration given to running Chance as a presidential candidate. Both a modern fable and a political satire, Being There was based on the novel by Jerzy Kosinski and costars Melvyn Douglas, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar as Eve's aging power-broker husband.",

Peter Sellers is perfect and often hilarious as the main character who, without trying, becomes a profound person that is loved by everyone. It's sort of like the smart man's Forrest Gump. Hal Ashby does a great job with this film, I really loved the scene near the beginning where Chance first leaves the house and enters the real world. The whole cast is great and it's really a clever film.",
