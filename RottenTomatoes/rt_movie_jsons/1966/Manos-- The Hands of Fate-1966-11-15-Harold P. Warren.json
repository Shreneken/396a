            "content": "If it wasn't for MST3K, I wouldn't have seen Manos: The Hands of Fate. I knew I had to see it to see if it really was that bad. The negative criticisms and those slamming it as the worst movie ever do not lie, Manos: The Hands of Fate is as bad as all that. There is such thing as a terrible movie that has novelty comic value, but there is also such thing as a movie that is too inept to take that into consideration. Some will disagree, but I consider Manos: The Hands of Fate as a good example of the latter. To call the way the movie is made amateurish is being too kind, the camera work and editing are all over the place and makes anything that happens incomprehensible. The visual effects are dated and make everything even more artificial than it already is, while the bizarre and often out of sync sound effects and a score that is shrill and monotonous are enough to make your ears bleed. And even when your poor ears are suffering enough, they are assaulted even more by dialogue that is stilted, insultingly cheesy and too talky and some of the worst and annoying acting ever in film history. The villain is quite possibly the most laughable and underwhelming villain ever and you'd be hard pressed to find one that is worse-acted than here. Torga is the best thing about Manos: The Hands of Fate, but that's saying nothing as he's still irritating. The direction is so flat that you have to look hard to find evidence of any direction at all, while the story is incredibly thin and is so plodding that you're dying of boredom. In conclusion, hopelessly inept. 0/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "Manos: The Hands of Fate is the story of a family who become lost while driving thought the West Texas desert and are menaced by a polygamous cult. It also a strong contender for the title of worst movie ever made. With glacial pacing, a threadbare plot, very little that could be described as acting, no real production values to speak of, and nothing remotely scary or exciting, it's a near perfect example of how not to make a movie.\n\nThis makes a lot a lot of sense once you know the story behind the movie. You see, Manos was written, directed, and produced by an El Paso insurance salesman with no experience in film or acting, in order to win a bet that he could make a movie. He did this with a near zero budget, a cast of community theater volunteers and random townspeople, and the absolute minimum of editing and post-production work possible. He won his bet, but seeing the result, you'll seriously wonder if it was worth it. \n\nAt least the first five minutes consist of the family driving aimlessly around the desert, passing the same amorous teenage couple again and again, in what may be the most pointless, meandering opening sequence ever put on film. Apparently, this was supposed to be a leisurely opening credits sequence, but the filmmakers ran out of money to add the credits, and just left it in to pad the runtime. It drags on and on, going nowhere, adding nothing to the story, until they finally reach the Master's house. Sadly, this brings very little improvement in plot or pacing.\n\nInstead we're mainly treated to slow, awkward conversations, aborted attempts to leave the Master's house for somewhere safer, and even more shots of that teen couple making out in their car. The closest thing this movie has to a high point is the extended catfight between the Master's nightgown clad wives, but even this gets boring after the first couple minutes. You know you're in trouble when you can't make gratuitous exploitation work.\n\nAs with any bad horror movie, the characters spend far too much time wandering around looking for each other, calling out each other's names over and over with no reply. You wouldn't think it would take them so long to find each other in such a small house in the absolute middle of nowhere. Then again, it is pretty dark, and these people aren't very bright. \n\n Now the reason it's so dark is that in order to accommodate the cast and crew's day jobs, most shooting was done at night. Only they didn't have the budget for proper lighting, so most of the exterior scenes are pitch black. Hence the scene in which police hear gunshots, walk a few steps from their car to investigate, then turn around and give up because it's too dark to see anything. The lack of production values is even more apparent when one of the night scenes cuts to a piece of stock footage- instantly recognizable as such because it's better lit and photographed than any other part of the movie.\n\nIf there is any redeeming value to this production beyond sheer camp, it's John Reynold's one of a kind performance as Torgo, the Master's slow talking, long suffering henchman and housekeeper. I'm not saying it's a good performance. In fact, it's about as far from anything resembling a good performance as can be imagined. But between his stilted, halting speech, jerking movements, and near constant facial tics, Reynold's acting is so awful, so creepy, in such a uniquely bizarre way, that it's almost hypnotic. Like a Beatnik version of Nic Cage, he's either manic or semi-comatose in every scene. No one could possibly be this terrible on purpose, and I was not at all surprised to learn that he was in fact a heavy drug user.\n\nThe other performances are also uniformly bad, but aside from a few amusingly overwrought outbursts from the Master, only in the flat, boring manner of the entire movie. It's kind of amazing that it takes over ninety minutes for so little to happen, or that what's supposed to be a horror movie can be so utterly devoid of anything remotely scary. It does manage to be intermittently creepy, but only in all the wrong ways, as in the deeply unwholesome final scene, which I can only hope the filmmakers didn't realize the full undertones of.\n\nThe whole thing is just an utter mess of earnest intentions colliding with woeful ineptitude, like Ed Wood minus the minor celebrities and special effects. It's slow, boring, disjointed, frequently bizarre, and completely botched on every imaginable level. If there is a lesson to this movie, it's that just because you can do something, it doesn't mean you should. I cannot recommend the original cut, even to the most committed bad movie lovers. However, I can recommend the Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment, which makes for a rather amusing, relatively painless introduction to the cult of Manos.",

Therefore, it can be watched for escapist entertainment, mocking the low quality or even for technical analyses.

            "content": "Okay, so this movie is bad.  We can all agree on that.  Instead of telling you why, let me make the case for a reboot of this film and how it should go.\n\n1. The remake needs to be over-budget and directed by Michael Bay.  It must have gratuitous special effects that add nothing to the plot nor the overall believability of the film.  In fact, a failure to suspend of disbelief is a requirement just like the original.\n2. The dialog from Hal Warren's screenplay cannot be changed under any circumstances.\n3. The original failed to make the beginning of the film as boring as it really could have been.  The landscape must not match any recognizable region of the US or Europe, and must nonsensically transition from temperate to desert in order to isolate the rule of isolation that should be the main theme of this film.\n4. Because a reboot of this film would be set in the 21st Century, no cell phone nor satellite service is a must. However, whoever remakes this film should fail to capitalize on this and any other themes including seclusion, isolation, or loneliness.  As tempting as it would be to any sensible person to explore the loneliness of Torgo's character, this easy opening to develop character needs to be avoided as it was in the original.\n5. Characters:\nMichael has to be an idiot without being idiotic, he has to be condescending without emoting condescension, and he was to be unsurprisingly average without seeming to be overtly average nor inept.  A younger Kevon Costner-type should have play this role.\n\nThe actress who plays Margaret should be billed as beautiful, but only has not look unattractive. Her character does not have to exude sexiness nor does it have to attract.  Her job in the original and the remake is to be feminine.  When Torgo hits on her awkwardly, she should not emote any reaction whatsoever except to eventually catch on that Torgo is making a pass at her.  In fact, the less cerebral this scene is made, the better.\n\nThe child or dog can be any random child or dog-looking animal who can take simple direction (sit, stand, say something...).  In fact, all they have to do is to fit the \"lost thing\" paradigm and there has to be some amount of sympathy for their having been lost or killed.  These two roles can be played by any animal-like organism that would elicit some sense of loss of they were no longer there. The Second Unit production crew can handle filming their parts.  As such, there's no need to cast anyone known for these two parts; the film's money should be wasted elsewhere.\n\nThe Master needs NOT to be played by a washed-up actor looking to rehabilitate their acting career -- any interesting backstory within the film or beyond the fourth wall would make the role and the film too compelling and interesting.  In fact, the actor who plays the role of the really evil Master needs to be less interesting in person than they appear in the painting Michael and Margaret encounter shortly after entering the dwelling.\n\nIn an era or Political Correctness, Torgo cannot be handicapped.  That's not a bad thing because any handicap would make a case for a meaningful backstory.  Torgo has to be just odd and just odd should suffice.  Any more than that would make would diminish his meager backstory (the only meaningful backstory in the original film) of being infatuated with the Master's wives.  That is the driver of this film:  not the sense of isolation, not what made him have intensely swollen and misshapen legs, not the fact that he strange accent which might make it interesting if we found out he was was somewhere else, or event the fact that he carries a staff.  Its my belief that Torgo is should really treated Radagast from the \"Lord of the Rings\" books and not the fully-developed version Peter Jackson developed in \"The Hobbit.\"  Just some guy in brown (or khaki) with a hat and a staff who bathes infrequently and isn't from around those parts.  That's being generous and maybe too much so.\n\nMegan Fox needs to chick who makes out with the guy who gets caught like 2 or 3 times by the police.  The officer should be Sting because his English accent makes the \"small-town cop\" vibe more believable if you are on intense medications and because I think Sting should do more small-bit parts in more meaningless films.  \n\nMark Wahlberg should be NOT be the dude making out with her and ANY song by Marky-Mark and the Funky Bunch SHOULD NOT be playing on the radio whilst kissing and drinking Robitussin cough syrup is done hedonistically yet without abandon.  The Hedonistic-without-Abandon is a MUST, Megan Fox is a must, and the dude should be one of the lesser-known Baldwin Brothers trying to pass himself off as being 20 years younger and yet serious.\n\nYep.  That about sums it up.",

Problem with all of these elements being the execution of them. Everything is loosely and flimsily connected by a thin thread. In fact if the character ever left the house the film would have no plot to speak off. With the exception of Torgo secondary characters are useless. A couple too cheap to afford a cheap hotel or go to their parent homes always make out publicly in a car. Easily persuadable policemen who give you a free pass on a speeding ticket if you're late and for some reason making out in public is illegal in this town or desert. Than the six wives of The Master each younger than the last. Unfortunately given the context within the film the couple daughter not being killed could be debated that the Master is a ped...better yet lets avoid that territory altogether. Also I want to meet the person who dubbed this. I'm no expert on the English language, but are you sure \"You all are mad. Mad the whole lot of you.\" is proper English. Characters have no development not even enough to be one dimensional. Each character has one trait (like being hungry) and that's about it. Now no one could talk this film without mentioning the iconic Torgo. This character is the sole reason this film thrives in awfulness. Actor John Reynold non-experience as an actor gives the character a nice touch. His awkward walk from probably smoking one too many joint, goofy facial expression, and silly line delivery adds to a layer of entertainment to his character.\r\n\r\nAs for the other area the film is a complete failure. For the first half hour the amazement of how every bad decision accumulated into a something so shockingly bad is something difficult to not want to look at. Than the second half becomes a tedious series of repetition slowly loosing its charm. The editing in this film is among the worst anyone could string together. Lines of dialogue repeat loop, awkward cuts that make you question if the copy of the film you're watching is in poor condition, and the improper timing of inserting music. For example, when first meeting Torgo \"scary\" music plays when Torgo is getting luggage from a car. It seems the clown noise someone was squeaking behind the scenes was kept in the film for some reason. Music in this film sounds like the instruments themselves were laughing. One of the most noticeable of laughing instruments is during the worst catfight ever staged is scored using a laughing Saxophone. Editing just in general is questionable. In one scene a dog goes out into the desert and is killed by what sounds like Ducks. It will leave your jaws open in how bad editing could scoop down to. As for the acting it lives up to its reputation. Actors break the forth wall looking directly in the cameras and monotone performances. Because of the poor editing you could spot clapperboards, actor getting to their location for the scene, and scenes where it's clear the actors themselves are holding the camera. As far as art direction goes it lacking evidently; the only time it chooses to expresses itself beyond limitation is The Master cape having two giant hands on it. Aside from that everything has and retains a low-budget feel.\r\n\r\nHands: Los Manos of Fate lives up to its reputation, but not entirely like how one would expect. It's devoid of any proper craftsmanship yet the cast and crew heart behind it is felt regardless how the quality turned out. There's a reason audiences go seeking this \"awful\" film and avoid atrocities such as Monster-A-Go-Go. A bad film can entertain it audiences even if how it does that is unintentional as oppose to one that doesn't. Who would wants to dig up a fifty plus year old that will infuriates them. On the surface everybody clearly sees the rough edges, but some that look past that sees an entity that brings a good time like any film attempts to do.",

But is it any worse than major Hollywood fodder where they should know better? Probably, but seeping beneath the layers of dubbing, irrelevant scenes and prolonged pauses between dialogue is a memorable and audacious attempt at proving someone wrong. Concept-wise there are elements taken from 50's and 60's horror and the acting by John Reynolds and Tom Neyman simulate and emulate fear within you,\nI refuse to believe that this is 'the worst of the worst' and pales in comparison to some other fodder churned out in cinemas since and that it is less enjoyable than Ed Wood films.\nSurely it's better to burn out than fade away, the Master would not approve of your distain towards this film.",

Warren. \nEssentially, like many other films of the worst of all time genre, the plot just doesn't make the slightest bit of sense and is only of relevance to the word Manos through strange and terrible scriptwriting. Essentially, the characters embody no cult, massage each other to death and the entire film had some unspecified role in contributing to the suicide of lead actor John Reynolds, and the mystery surrounding that is one of the pieces of the films legacy.\nI didn't particularly hate Manos: The Hands of Fate, but there's nothing to like and it isn't even worth watching just for the stupidity.
