When the younger couple arrive, the night erupts into a no-holds-barred torrent of marital angst and verbal tirades.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? \n\nA film that was conceived from the play, written by Edward Albee. The main characters reside as Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor, George (her husband), played by Richard Burton, Nick by George Segal, and Honey, by Sandy Dennis. Directed by Mike Nichols, it's a very up and down film in my opinion. Side note: Mike also had balls for shooting his first film as a play, even though he brought on some of the best actors there are. Martha and George don't have the best relationship. Martha is a loud character with very expressed emotions, while George is a little quieter.  Marthas a bitter and hopeless alcoholic, and George is a failed history professor at the college that Marthas father runs. The combination for a couple is just horrible. It deteriorates so easily and the two can never get along. The production is done by Ernest Lehman, and I believe him and Nichols did a great job portraying the intensity of the film and the relationship between Martha and George. The camera angles and zooms at certain points keep the audience waiting for what comes next in terms of emotions. Whether Martha is going to blow up as always, or she's going to hold back and just make a sour comment. George is a very meticulous person in the way that every comment he makes has a meaning to it, usually in a bad way. They're both very frightening people, they're manipulative towards each other. George and Martha also have an imaginary son. It's madness. The whole night with Nick and Honey they're talking about their \"little bugger\" coming home. When's he gonna come home? No one knows if he's real or not. \n\nMy favorite point however to make about this movie is that Mike Nichols was insanely smart for getting Elizabeth Burton and Richard Taylor to play these roles. The couple wasn't always the best. They had both been divorced as least twice, marrying each other after. But they were up and down as well. They weren't always so steady, which helped them act out their roles in the film. In my opinion, some of the anger from Martha and some of the comments from George seemed so real, like they had already been said before in real life. It was a miraculous job by Nichols to pair them up for the part. \n\n6/10. I wasn't a huge fan of the movie. But the production was good and like I said, Nichols balls to direct the play as a film for his first was impressive.",

            "content": "This film was directed by Mike Nichols and produced by Ernest Lehman.  The main characters of the film are portrayed by Elizabeth Taylor (Martha), Richard Burton (George), George Segal (Nick), and Sandy Dennis (Honey).  The film centers on a middle-aged couple in a very unhappy marriage that draw their young guests, a new faculty member and his wife (Segal, Dennis) into an evening of cruel manipulation and games (Burton and Taylor are married in real life at this time).  Elizabeth Taylor as Martha, who is the daughter of a university president married to George, a faculty member is a brash and seductive character that can be both cruel one minute and a loving wife the next.  Burton as George initially appears as a harried and abused husband, however, his subtle and vicious remarks ultimately put him in charge of the dark game the couple plays.  The fact that both characters appear to be alcoholics in the film contributes to their dark and rancorous communication with each other.  Despite the obvious deterioration of their marriage though, there appears to be an unhealthy need for each other.  Nick and Honey (Segal and Dennis) despite their initial inclination to leave the situation, allow themselves to be caught up in the menacing drama.\n\nThe film is shot in black and white, which perfectly compliments the dark mood of the film.  The set of the couple's home, which looks run down and shabby also reflects the couple's deteriorating marriage.  These two artistic approaches really helped to convey the downward spiral that the relationship is taking.  Ernest Lehman's adaptive screenplay impressively captures the brooding nature of Edward Albee's original Broadway play.\n\nI highly recommend this film as there is a tremendous amount of talent on display here.  Taylor and Burton are at their best in this film, perhaps drawing from their tumultuous marriage in real life. Segal and Dennis as the young couple also give notable performances.  Lehman has written a brilliant screenplay based on Edward Albee's dark Broadway play, and Haskell Wexler does a brilliant job with the black and white cinematography in bringing out the darkness of the film's subject matter. Even the music presents a gloomy atmosphere of foreboding.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, written by Edward Albee, was directed by Mike Nichols and released to the public in 1966. The movie won the award for best actress in a leading role and was a well-liked film post-release. \n\nThe film begins with the couple coming home from one of her father's get-togethers, and the very first thing she notes when she looks around their house is, \"What a dump.\" Martha is an unrefined woman who speaks her mind any chance she gets, occasionally getting her into hiccups throughout the film. Martha is also an alcoholic, and her drinking leads to impaired decision-making. Her husband, George, attempts to constrain her explosive personality. The couple has an imaginary child who is about to turn 16, and George is unsure if the child belongs to him, creating tension between the couple. They talk about their kid to their friends, and George dislikes the topic of their son. At one point in the film, George shares a story with Nick about a kid he grew up with who accidentally killed both his parents and ended up in an asylum. After confessing to Nick that he sees him as a threat when it comes to Martha. The couple stops at a barroom to dance, and Nick dances suggestively with Martha bringing this threat to life. A fight erupts, and Martha leaves with Nick and Honey and takes Nick up to the bedroom to engage in sexual activity. This leads to George saying he received a telegram saying their son had died using the same story he previously told nick about the boy who killed his own parents. Obviously, this was all made up in an attempt to get back at Martha, which works. The movie ends with the other couple leaving Martha and George alone at their house as the day breaks.\n\nI would say that the filming of this movie and some of the camera techniques used were ahead of their time. I think the story was really good and developed well. I don't have any major criticisms of this movie and would recommend it to plenty of people. I think this movie is suitable for any of age audience and is a good reflection of life and dealing with struggles through different coping mechanisms.",

            "content": "Mike Nichols' Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf embraces the task of translating a theatrical production to a mainstream film. The source material does not lend itself into creating an action-packed film with traditional or trendy story aspects, but it is rather a deep character study focused on its two main leads. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are more than up to the task and give incredible performances, showcasing their extraordinary chemistry. The script is tight and held nothing back in fear of criticism or censorship, which was a controversial choice for the time. Technical aspects all embrace that the story is now in film and has room to explore with how viewers will perceive each scene and shot.\n\nThe story centers around George, a history professor at a private college in New England, and his wife, Martha, whose father is the president of the school. The runtime glimpses into one night of the couple's life, as they return home from a faculty party and have a younger couple over as guests. As the couples drink more, the conversation becomes increasingly hostile, abrasive, and uncomfortable. It's interesting how the spectacle of the matter is not so much the hatred and turmoil we see between Martha and George, but instead that they choose to put it on full display in front of company. As the night goes on, the two only become more outwardly disdainful, but we're offered brief glimpses into underlying feelings that aren't so negative perhaps.\n\nWhile the performances were incredibly strong and the writing sharp, I personally found that I didn't really enjoy this film. The concept works in any format I believe, but due to my own preferences I'd rather read it as a screenplay to have more time with the words or see it in a live theatrical production with more atmosphere and less distractions. Viewing it at home felt more like a chore to peer in at over two hours focused on just one night in the characters' lives. I just prefer that type of storytelling in other formats and perhaps think the runtime could have been shaved down to make the film more easily digestible for film audiences or perhaps more added stylization to really distinguish it from its stage counterpart.",

Every word of the speech is moving, and the discourse's tempo varies from slow to rapid, gradually escalating to a climax at the moment of greatest stress, before abruptly easing down. \n\nMartha's frenzy and her husband George's tension, which is sometimes subdued and other times explosive, stem from their profound loathing. The animosity stemmed from Martha's initial pursuit of George, their unequal marriage, George's lackluster work, their mismatched expectations, and Martha's early-morning disclosure of their most private secret. Their secret was their fictitious son, which kept their marriage together. \n\nThe young woman's remark of the bell alerted George that their kid had passed away just before daybreak. His son's passing was announced. He decided the death of his son. An equally fictional telegram was sent to the son's \"parents,\" his cerebral acerbity, but his inauthentic \"parents,\" informing them that he had passed away. The son had been \"living\" for 16 years. \n\nThis middle-aged couple on a college campus has attempted to conceal the gaps in their life through a variety of means. Before the dawn could rise, however, they were forced to awaken to the discovery of their secret. There are shadows everywhere beneath the sun, and this waking is just the beginning of another more terrible one. \n\nThe narrative of the second part of the evening raised the question of whether life is based in fact or in fiction. Or how the acceptance of the brutality of confronting reality will become more brutal if the dream escape ends. \n\nYes, the original author, screenplay, director, lead actress, lead actor, supporting actress, supporting actor, cinematography, costumes, and music.

This film, which has the distinguishment of being the first movie to be nominated for every eligible Academy Award and won two (Best Actress in Leading Role and Best Actress in Supporting Role). The film stars Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, who also had a tumultuous and intricate love story of their own. In the film, a history professor of a small college named George (Richard Burton) is married to the president of the college's daughter, Martha (Elizabeth Taylor). The couple invites over a younger couple named Nick and Honey. Nick is a professor of biology who recently started teaching at the same college as George. The events of the movie take place in one evening with the couples' banter turns from subvert passive aggressive behavior towards their respective spouses into full overt arguments and vicious behavior towards every member of the group. It eventually climaxes when it is revealed that Martha and George have created the illusion of a son between the two of them and Martha breaks their one rule of not mentioning their \"son\" to anyone else. The movie ends with the already fractured marriage, in broken pieces of disillusion as they have to face reality once again. This film explores many themes, one of them being the deviation of what domestic couples were portrayed as in films. At the onset, it seems as though both couples are normal individuals, but as the night goes on, we see the illusion unravel as all members of the party reveal aspects of dysfunction that the audience can resonate with. The movie makes the audience wonder whether illusions that bond are better than a reality that tears apart.",

Burton a professor at a university was brilliant with his crafty calculated approach when his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invites a young handsome professor and his wife over for drinks. Taylor pulled off a disparaging attitude towards her husband George (Richard Burton) that ignites a night that is filled with secrets, lies, adultery, and mind games. Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) are the young couple that are brought into a scene of anger and hatred between Burton and Taylor and ultimately get tangled up into the game that reveals some secrets of their own.

            "content": "Marriage cannot be without love- Appreciation of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\nIt is the only movie that has won all the Oscar nominations. It is directed by Mike Nichols and adapted from the stage play.\n\"Marriage later consists of women's wishful thinking and men's indifference.\" There are only four actors in this film, two couples, one middle-aged and one newly married. The whole film is the drunken truth of these four people. Martha and George's marriage is full of holes. From the hole, we can see endless hatred and few and weak love. Martha's noble family background makes her form a self-centered personality, making trouble for her husband everywhere. George's low family background and lack of fertility make him live in the shadow of his wife, but he wants to be respected by men. All these laid the foundation for their contradiction. Like the shotgun that can pop an umbrella, the end of hatred can only be an embarrassing end. When they uncover their scars, they need to support each other to get out of the real pain and continue to hurt each other next time, which is a very sad situation. What is sadder is that all the clues in the film also show that the young couple will go on the same road of hatred as them in the future.\nFor the same script as the stage play, the version we see can reflect the highly selective hidden and highlight, not only the dynamic scene frame, but also the amplification of the characters focusing on the close-up of the characters' faces and the amplification of the voice of the more prominent characters whispering. More importantly, the film uses motion shots and quick cuts to transfer scenes and viewpoints, so that the psychological changes of characters can rely on the changes of physical scenes. In addition, the scenes of lawn and tavern in the film can also play a role in adjusting the intensive lines. I think this film looks a bit boring because of too much dialogue, but the core of absurdity and marriage tragedy conveyed by the film is also conveyed to the audience in this way.\nIn general, this is a landmark film, which combines absurdity, incomprehensibility between people, escapism and other factors very well. It can also give our audience's view of love and marriage a very important reference.",

It is an oddly deceiving introduction to the film as what follows will capture your attention and make you afraid to look away for fear that you will miss something. And even when you did not look away from the screen it always feels like you are a step behind in the film missing a key part. Elizabeth Taylor as Martha and Richard as George are the stars of the film and their relationship will make you wonder if you have stepped into the life of a couple that have a love/hate relationship. The film will also make you think twice about alcohol consumption. Whether the issues of the characters are brought on by their need to continue the night's festivities. You will also discover that the other characters Nick and Honey only seem to make the otherwise chaotic scenes even more so crazed. \nI would personally recommend this film because despite how chaotic the scenes are they Elizabeth Taylor character Martha make every scene worth watching, Richard Burton makes you feel as if you are going to witness a crime at any given moment and the both of them together keeps you glue to the screen in the most uncomfortable way. The film is depicted in black and white and there are times the angles of the film makes you feel as if you are a fly on the wall intruding on a personal matter.

More drinks are poured during this one night than every season of Mad Men combined, and the film begins at two in the morning.

Mike Nichols (The Graduate) is masterful in his directorial debut. The film has such an intimate feel it's as if you're trapped on that 4th wall couch. The \"rifle\" scene and George sitting alone on the swing especially stood out to me, but there isn't a dull moment, even if you're kinda dying for one. Nick and George personify their respective departments at the unnamed college: Nick, biology, young, strapping, blond, handsome; George, history, old(ish), archaic, a thing that is passed. Apparently, Elizabeth Taylor gained 30lbs for the role, pulling a Christian Bale in 1966, and deserved the shit outta that Oscar. She's not just a tour de force but a force majeure, she's my worst nightmare, in her own words, she's \"the Earth mother and [we] are all flops\". They're Kong and Godzilla and Nick and Honey are 100,000 shrieking civilians \u2014 the real terror comes, however, when our monsters team-up. Misery loves company, misery loves co-dependency.

Throughout the night, Martha and George will be constantly arguing between them and with their guests, which will lead all of them to talk about their past and secrets.  \n\nOne of the highlights of the movie is the breathtaking acting of Elizabeth Taylor and Burton, they were the perfect couple for the movie not only because of their talent but also because the movie represents a couple like their real-life relationship. They were known for their tumultuous and toxic romance, same as Martha and George's one, however, their drama might have been entertaining for magazines and newspapers, but too repetitive for a two-hour long movie. \n\nDespite being repetitive mostly at the beginning, the film provides the public with different intriguing clues that managed to keep me curious and expecting the truth.

The title related to the writer Virginia Woolf and the Three Little Pigs alludes to living without illusion, at the end that is what Martha says, she is afraid of living without illusion. \n\nNichols did a great decision by filming the movie in black and white because of the ambient of the film and to hide the makeup that had to be done in Taylor to make her look older. The camerawork also performs a significant role in transmitting tension, they created different mechanisms to provide us with original and special shots, such as the one in the bar, for example, the dancing one made with high-angles or from the character's point of view. \n\nIn conclusion, despite the excessing amount of drama, Taylor and Burton's acting is really accurate and one of the best ones I have ever seen. The movie is worth watching and I would recommend it to everybody because of the unexpected ending.",

            "content": "What is Real and What is a Lie?  A Review of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\nThe Film Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf Follows the story of a night where a young couple named Nick and Honey Come and visit a middle-aged arguing couple named Martha and George. Martha and George who are played by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton respectively are constantly arguing and discussing points that are hard to determine if they are real or fake. The film is an amazing exploration of the complexities of not only relationships, but the importance of understanding the real from fake. There is an interesting exploration of how a simple joke or fib with some truth or emotional backing can lead to serious emotional harm over time. The film is really one that you need to watch and pay full attention to understand all the complex nuanced story saying that is present. At first the film seems a little hard to follow, but as the plot develops the story comes together. The way the movie progresses it leaves the viewer constantly guessing what is happening and questioning the motive of all the characters and who is telling the truth. I personally enjoyed the complexity of the story, and the direction of Mike Nicholas creates a viewing experience that leaves the viewer pleasantly confused. I found myself wonder what is going on throughout parts of this film as there where quick settings changes and the story moved linearly, yet the subject of dialog is constantly changing. In most cases when a movie confuses the view it is not a good thing, but in this case the tension it builds leads to an incredible conclusion that brings everything together. The film is hard to look away from as you are constantly perplexed by the relationships on screen that leave you guessing what is going to happen next. The flow of the film is as if there is a constant cliff hanger, and every piece of dialog is a mystery that you must solve to decide if what the character is real or total fabrication. The film is not something I would watch if you were not prepared to be engaged and really think about a story, but if you are prepared to watch attentively this film is amazing.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a 1966 film directed by Mike Nichols. The movie was based on the play by Edward Albee and stars Elizabeth Taylor as Martha, Richard Burton as George, and George Segal as Nick. The film was produced by Ernest Lehman, who also wrote the screenplay. The film takes place over the course of one evening and follows a middle-aged couple, George and Martha, who invite a younger couple, Nick and Honey, over for late-night drinks after a party. The film examines both couples' tenuous marriages as they spend a stressful evening bickering and drinking.    \n\tProduction highlights include stellar acting by all four main characters, particularly Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, as well as captivating cinematography by Haskell Wexler. Taylor portrays Martha as both callous and critical, living in her own imaginary self-centered world. Burton's suspenseful performance reveals his character slowly, evolving from normal but unambitious to positively maniacal. Taylor and Burton display extreme focus in their acting, sinking deep into the psyches of their characters as each attempts to gain control over the other in fits of fast-paced overlapping dialogue. \nWexler's cinematography adds to the tense atmosphere of the film by favoring close-up shots of the character's faces. Additionally, he utilizes many point-of-view shots, often switching back and forth between different character's viewpoints as they converse, allowing the viewer to easily understand each character's experience in the film. Wexler even occasionally uses blurred shots to illustrate a character's alcohol-induced haze. Dark lighting and a haunting score by Alex North add to the movie's strained suspense.  \nOverall, I highly recommend this film because of the way it forces the viewer to actively engage with the film in order to understand its complex characters. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a psychological drama, but the film has elements of mystery and keeps the audience thinking the whole time as they attempt to uncover each character's true motives. \nThis film plays heavily with the idea of illusions, sending a clear message about the danger of living in one's imagination. The fictional life that Martha and George have created for themselves only magnifies their inadequacies, falling to pieces as soon as reality starts to seep in. At the end of the day, Martha and George are incapable of accepting reality, choosing instead to create drama so that they can continue to play their chosen parts.",

Taylor uses such to move highly seductively and Burton to deliver what amounts to twisted and practiced soliloquy delivered to spite the others.  Otherwise they deliver virtuoso performances of a script that few could merely handle.    Segal and Dennis do excellent jobs with material that is only slightly less difficult to perform.  \n\nEasily described as a superbly acted abomination against humanity, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is so evocative that it might raise the newly deceased.",

(1966) is a landmark of realistic, toxic relationships being portrayed as alcoholics on screen. I don't know if I'd watch this emotional pain again, because I felt drained by the end. It's a long 131 minutes with a slow pace and few cuts from editor Sam O'Steen. You're meant to feel like you're in the room or watching Edward Albee's play and that can get old. \n\nHaskell Wexler's black and white cinematography is gorgeous and keeps you engaged during these long conversations, and Richard Sylbert's production design is often intriguing. This home looks actually messy with George James Hopkins' set decoration looking hilariously trashy. Nichols delivered a classic film that is still riveting, but it'll make you sad and perhaps frustrated with the ambiguous ending.\n\nElizabeth Taylor is incredible as she screams and freaks out to get her way as a stubborn and emotionally damaged alcoholic wife. You feel how miserable her married life is as she doesn't enjoy anything but drinking or being cruel. \n\nErnest Lehman's screenwriting captures Edward Albee's words with pithy insults and deep cutting remarks that push buttons in mean spirited ways. It's certainly like watching mean spirited drunks raving at each other, which has its appeal, but Taylor and Burton can be talking over each other too much. It's like the anxiety inducing dialogue from Uncut Gems at times.\n\nRichard Burton is excellent and captivating as the miserable alcoholic husband to Elizabeth Taylor. I found his frustration both funny in how antagonistic he gets and tragic as he's hopelessly unhappy. His chemistry with Taylor is fun in a brutally honest and toxically cruel way as you believe they have issues in this relationship. Alex North's subtle score creeps in to emphasize how twisted this pair have become as you never think that they'll be okay.\n\nGeorge Segal's new man on campus who Elizabeth Taylor likes is interesting as a foil for Burton to despise. Witnessing Burton get revenge is both satisfying and humiliating in a way. You cringe for how awkward and awful these characters are even the sweet Sandy Dennis gets to the point of being a raving drunk, unhappy with her life. I love her clapping and cheering on the couple's \"Violence!\"\n\nIn all, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a brutally hard film to watch, but a rewarding picture due to the impeccably raw acting.",

            "content": "\"TAKES MY BREATH AWAY\" LOVE FILMS\nby Timothy J. Verret\n\nI'm as drawn to love films as a beautiful and majestic horse is drawn to water. I create so much about and from the notion of love that it sometimes is hard for me to take a decent, deep breath. Here are 10 (actually 11) films about love (or the lack thereof) that \"take my breath away\" and heal my still-sometimes-very-broken heart (BOTH!):\n\n1. SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (1998):\nThis would indeed be my all-time favorite love film because it's got Shakespeare and it's got that message: \"Love is the ONLY inspiration.\" This film is inspired by a great and awe-inspiring love for acting, writing, directing, and how passion engages all of these things in one love film. Even if this film was not an ode to why Shakespeare wrote sonnets in the first place, the scene where Viola is onstage in a staged production of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET and William is lovingly looking at her from the wings is more than enough of a reason why I adore this love film. Viola loves William, William loves Viola, and the music takes us away to just this one moment of two looks and two smiles all looked and smiled in the name of a beautiful, all-encompassing love. That scene alone \"takes my breath way\" every time I see it. Even though this film is #10 on my all-time favorite films' list, it is solidly #1 on my all-time favorite love films' list (I guess you could say, \"so the last shall be first, and the first shall be last\" [Matthew 20:16]). \ud83d\ude09\n\n2. SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE (1973):\nSwedish director Ingmar Bergman is not known for gushy and silly love films, but this film IS a very serious love film because Bergman gives us both the glory and grime of a marriage dissolving. In true and typical Bergman fashion, each scene of this film is a very serious \"take my breath away,\" because the truth and turmoil at the heart of this marriage ending are about as real as my hand in front of my face. Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson as Marianne and Johan give towering performances. I will never forget the scene where Marianne and Johan go to the lawyer's office to sign the divorce papers and literally get into a fist fight. After the fight (and the marriage) is over, they both with their tattered hair and hearts sign the divorce papers. This film is as stunning as it is sacrificial. Marriage IS sacrifice and when that's not there, stunning is any marriage's dissolvement. I probably could have listed a handful of Ingmar Bergman films that explore the theme of this kind of intense love, but I have to keep this list as brief as possible.\ud83d\ude09\n\n3. MARRIAGE STORY (2019):\nVery much like SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, this film is haunting and often horribly uneasy to sit through. Scarlett Johansson as Nicole and Adam Driver as Charlie give exceptionally riveting performances as a married couple with way too big egos (she is an actress and he is a theatre director and if that's not \"way too big egos,\" I don't know what is). I will never forget the scene where Nicole goes to Charlie's apartment and they are in the throws of so much anger and so much hurt that the walls of Charlie's apartment are about to come down. Johansson's Nicole delivers to Driver's Charlie the line that is THE line where love hoped to save this marriage and love can't save this marriage intersect, \"You're so merged with your own selfishness, you don't even identify it as selfishness anymore!\" That line \"took my breath away\" because I totally identified with it. A marriage on its way to a divorce is all about selfishness unidentified anymore. The proclaimed egos of both partners \"win out\" and when ego \"wins out,\" everything is \"lost in\" a marriage war of two \"way too big egos.\"\n\n4. THE DANISH GIRL (2015):\nIt's so cool that this film is #4 on this list, as #4 is my spiritual number. It's also cool that this film is #4 on my all-time favorite films' list, as well. The story of Gerda and Einar (Lily) Wegener is what love films should always be about: The sacrifice one partner needs to make for a marriage to survive (often times in a marriage, both partners have to make sacrifices). Gerda makes the ultimate sacrifice by accepting that her husband, Einar, believes he is a woman and wants to have an operation to become Lily, the woman he always was on the inside. Anyone else that I can think of in Gerda's position would have said in response to this, \"no way, no how\u2026.this marriage is OVER!\" Gerda loves Einar so much that she is willing to do just about anything (and she does) to keep their love alive. Alicia Vikander (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actress) is an absolute and complete revelation in her performance as Gerda, and Eddie Redmayne completely and totally seals the deal in his performance in this film to make him my all-time favorite actor next to Joaquin Phoenix. I swear I could go on and on about how this film \"takes my breath away\" at every twist and turn where love is concerned but, once again, I'm needing to be brief here.\ud83d\ude09\n\n5. YENTL (1983):\nVery similar to THE DANISH GIRL, this film is not your conventional love film. It's about a woman who loves this man who thinks a woman is a man, this man who loves another woman who is also a woman but since he can't have this other woman, the man asks a woman to marry this other woman so he can be close to this other woman, and a woman who this man thinks is a man marries this other woman, and if none of that \"takes your breath away,\" I'm not sure what ever would! This film \"takes my breath away\" because it's simply about the lengths and heights and depths we find ourselves reaching for in the throes (or thrown) of love. And because I am a huge Barbra Streisand fan and this is Barbra's best film EVER, I can't think of any other love film that pleases and excites me more than this one. And never mind that it is mainly because of Barbra Streisand and my love for her that helped me to believe that I could ever be someone someday who could love someone someday. Now, that \"takes my breath away.\"\n\n6. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? (1966):\nWhile most in a million years would never call this film a \"love film,\" I do because it's a film about the absence of love in a marriage, the absence that is SO common in a lot of marriages, and an absence so penetrable that the married couple in this film actually make up that they have a child to keep the marriage bearable. Edward Albee's play and Mike Nichols' film adaptation are what I love most about stories where love has flown the coop (if it was ever in the coop in the first place), i.e., the dissection and probing of the insides of people who are losing their identity because love has become nonexistent while brutality and mean-spiritedness are what's left to exist. Elizabeth Taylor, known for her striking beauty, goes from \"riches to rags\" in her physical beauty and gives us an \"ugly\" Martha, a force of nature who is as forceful as she is vulnerable. Taylor, Best Actress Oscar winner) gives what I consider the very best female performance ever captured on film. Richard Burton as George and George Segal as Nick are also excellent, but it's the other female performance of Sandy Dennis as Honey (Best Supporting Actress Oscar winner) that makes this love film truly one that \"takes my breath away\" every time I see it\u2026.and I've seen it a lot!\ud83d\ude09\n\n7. TESS (1980):\nIf there can be any love film that is truly lovely to look it, it would be this film. Based on Thomas Hardy's classic novel of the same name, Roman Polanski directed this film that makes the novel come breathtakingly and beautifully alive. This film \"takes my breath away\" not just because it's pretty to look at but also because it is rapturous and daring to expose seduction between a man and a woman as actually rape, and how that one act of domination produces shame that stays with the victim. I know that one's shame is to be nailed to The Cross of Jesus but for some, death is the one way, and maybe the only way, to be rid of that shame. Nastassja Kinski as Tess might not be the best actress who ever lived, but Polanksi knew exactly what he was doing by casting her in the title role. Because Kinski was a relative unknown and maybe because Polanski knew she wasn't the greatest actress around, it was precisely these two very things that allowed Kinski to inhabit Tess as bright-eyed innocent, and na\u00efve. A well-known and a great actress would have destroyed these precious traits, so thank God Polanski and Kinski didn't. There's one scene of a closeup of Tess with the brightest yellow sun behind her that to this day, every time I see a sun like that, it \"takes my breath away,\" and I call it, \"the Tess sun.\" LOVE THAT! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n8. THE WAY WE WERE (1973):\nIt certainly makes sense that I would have two Barbra Streisand films on this list but even if I didn't love Streisand, this film would be on it anyway and probably most others' \"love film\" list. It's the ultimate love story of the girl over there and the guy over here and how there and here come together and we are all the better for being present to witness that. The odds are that two beautiful actors like Redford and Streisand couldn't possibly go wrong in a beautiful love film that ends with a closing scene that still \"takes my breath away.\" Streisand's Katie and Redford's Hubbell are looking at each other after having separated when famous Streisand takes that famous hand and famously brushes away that famous hair from Redford's famous face. \"See ya', Katie.\" \"See ya' Hubbell.\" See me balling my eyes out.\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude25\n\n9. CASABLANCA (1942):\nWhile not the film I would have included on my \"take my breath away\" love films' list, I'm including it because it's on the top of the list for two of my favorite people and because any film with an actor or actress with the last name of \"Bergman\" should be on any film list I compile (see #2 for that \"other Bergman\" film). That said, I have seen this film and I remember loving it very much. Many \"love film\" aficionado's are divided into two camps where this film's ending is concerned: One group wants Rick to let Ilsa board that plane to Lisbon with Laszlo for The Resistance, while the other group says, \"C'mon! Rick and Ilsa forever! We're not talking about The Resistance here! We're talking about love!\" This film reminds us that love doesn't always end as victorious as The Resistance, but what we cannot \"resist\" is that we loved in the first place. That is usually enough for any kind of love to take flight.\n\n10. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT (1934) and SOMEWHERE IN TIME (1980):\nI admit I was torn between which of these films to include to round out the top 10 \"take my breath away\" love films, until it dawned on me that both films have something very much in common: The element of time when and where love is lost and/or found. IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT is simple enough to say love can happen one night, whereas SOMEWHERE IN TIME says one night is fine, but true love cannot be contained by the element of time. Love can happen one night, sure, and then more nights can happen after that, but sometimes you have to go \"somewhere in time\" to find that love again. Whether one night or \"somewhere in time,\" love alters us to our very core and we do search time and space to find it, but there are no guarantees that the Jericho Walls (reference to the ending of IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT) will stay up or come down when love happens in just one night or \"somewhere\" outside of space and time for a lifetime.\n\nNow, I'm not currently in a love relationship (unless you count Jesus) but if I were, my partner would need to have seen AT LEAST one of these films. If not, watching AT LEAST one of these films is essential if any partner who loves me expects to \"take my breath away.\" \ud83d\ude09\u2764\ufe0f",

Great acting all around and impressive directing help this emotional story move along at a good pace. The themes help keep it relevant and the format itself acts as a commentary on Hollywood's previously one sided take on marriage. Brilliant.",

This older couple begin to air all their dirty laundry in front of this couple and we (the audience) begin to see just how fractured this marriage is. They men are facility members work for a University where Martha's father is the President so there is a dynamic in their relationship from the beginning. The visit consists of George and Martha taking swipes at each other all night while the younger couple who also indulge in drinking, begin to air their laundry as well. Their fights seem to always goes back to her father his money and influence and George not being able to live up to her dad.\nThis movie was shot in black and white I think to show dramatic effects of what was happening in the movie. The shots with just them in frame helped highlight the seriousness of what was going on in the scene. The midpoint of the movie is shot with the characters at the height of the disagreements /issues within their prospective marriages each scene seems to show them at their most emotional vulnerability. By the end of the movie we get a clearer picture as to what is going on with this couple paired with the music it softens these seemingly harsh and abrasive characters and helps give a better insight into how their marriage got to point in time where we meet them.\nI think the movie was great and I would recommend it if you want to learn how to take a play and turn it into a Hollywood classic. This movie deals with issues that can fester in a marriage to the point where it appears to the outside the two people in the marriage hate each other. These same issues over the years have torn the marriage apart but its also the thing that holds them together, shared emotional pain.  Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton comes across as a real couple dealing with some real problems in their marriage, they have learned to deal with these problems with alcohol and insulting each other. The younger couple to me represents what Martha and George used to be before the years turned them into this hateful version of themselves. If Honey and Nick are smart, they will address their issues before they find themselves the new Martha and George.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a play that first staged in 1962 by Edward Albee. The movie examines the complexities of marriage of a middle-aged couple, Martha and George. The play has a total of three acts which has been put together one after other. Edward Franklin Albee III (March 12, 1928 \u2013 September 16, 1016) was an American playwright known for his famous plays including Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and won Pultizer Prize for Drama. He had attracted theater attention by having scripted and published nine poems, eleven short stories, and essays.\n\nThe story is about two couples that are quite different at first sight \u2013 one used to each other and married for many years whereas the other one is newlyweds and getting to know each other. George and Martha who are the older couple whose relationship has gone through many ups and downs. They are drunk throughout the film. Despite of being together for so long, George and Martha don't have a good relationship they humiliate each other and have lost mutual respect towards each other. Nick and Honey visit the older couples house at two in the morning as they are the newly hired professors at the college where George teaches, and Martha's dad is the president at the same university. George and Martha had lost their son and I believe this is also one the reasons that their love had died, and they didn't know where to start from.\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Martha and George are excellent actors and have done an outstanding performance in the film. By watching this film viewers can imagine how real-life marriage resembled the relationship they and in this film. The movie has great acting, great writing and the camerawork has perfected the cinematic. Overall, I highly recommend this movie and there is not even a moment that you'd get bored out of the film. The movie is about marriage when you've been together for so long and the love slowly dies.",

            "content": "Mike Nichols first movie to direct was Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, which was a huge success and was historically significant. This film was originally a book written by Edward Albee, which was performed on Broadway prior to the making of the film. Ernest Lehman produced and wrote the screen play for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. The film starred two of the most popular actors during the 1960's as their main characters. Martha was played by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton played George. The other two key players in this film were George Segal who played Nick, and Sandy Dennis who played Honey. \n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? revolves around Martha and George, a married couple in their middle ages. Martha invites a younger married couple back to their home after a party they attended. Martha and George are constantly arguing and verbally abusing each other, in front of the other couple, making them feel a uncomfortable at first. There is a lot of alcohol involved. Martha privately tells Honey about her son which makes George extremely angry. Martha embarrasses George in front of the couple by telling them a humiliating story about George which makes him even more furious. As the night goes on and the younger couple is ready to leave George offers them a ride home. However, this this leads to more events which builds up more tension between Martha and George. They are at a roadhouse where George cannot stand Martha anymore and attacks her. Nick pulls George off Martha and she and the couple drive away leaving George to walk home. When he is finally home he notices that the car has been crashed with Honey in the back seat extremely intoxicated. George notices Nick and Martha together in the bedroom and interrupts. He brings up how their son has died in a car accident. However, this is where the truth comes out and Nick comes to a realization that they were lying about their son the entire time and he leaves with Honey. George and Martha are unable to have children, but they secretly pretended to each other that they actually had a son and had a promise they would never tell anyone else about him. George telling Martha that their son was killed in a car accident resembles the fact that Martha broke their promise to each other. The film ends with George singing the song they were playing throughout the night which is the title of the film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, where Martha at the end says that she is afraid. \n\n\nThe film was definitely a huge success and was a tremendous break through due to the vulgarity of the verbal abuse and the profaneness behavior. During the 1960's, films like this were not being released due to the Production Code. However, the code was removed so this film could be released, which makes it that much more appealing to its audience at the time. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was considered such a success and achievement it was nominated for thirteen Academy Award nominees, and ended up winning five of those awards. Elizabeth Taylor won an Oscar for her dazzling and incredible acting as Martha. Overall, this film received remarkable and unforgettable recognition from its audience.\n\nIt has always been difficult for me to watch movies that came out before the 2000. However, this film was extremely easy for me to get into. I have always admired Elizabeth Taylor and the fact that she gained 30 pounds to fit the role of Martha demonstrates how well she can transform herself into Martha. Also, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton being married at the time in real life and on set makes it that much more intriguing to watch, especially because the movie portrays them verbally abusing each other and overall pushing each other to their limits. I definitely would recommend anyone to watch this film if they have not seen it before. You won't regret it! \n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is such a classic because it made an impact on the film industry due to its profanity and language. It's always interesting to watch and analyze movies like this because now a days movies are so much different. This film was extremely interesting to watch and I'm really glad I was able to learn about the background of it.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, directed by Mike Nichols, explores the tumultuous relationship between a couple. Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor, and George, played by Richard Burton, arrive home at 2 AM from a college staff party, when Martha informs George that she has invited over a couple from the party. Nick, played by George Segal, and Honey, played by Sandy Dennis, arrive at the house only to quickly become part of George and Martha's fighting. As more alcohol is consumed and the night goes on, the fighting continues to escalate as more touchy subjects are discussed.\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf was originally a play written by Edward Albee. In its transition to film, the movie faced some initial resistance due to the adult themes featured in it. However, due to changes being made in film ratings, it made it through censors with only minor changes. \n\nWhether or not you enjoyed Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, it's hard not to see how fantastic the acting is in the film. Throughout the film, you can really see as each character becomes more and more drunk. Both Martha and George are clearly drunk the whole film, but Nick and Honey both start sober and become drunk through the film. With Honey, she quickly succumbs to the alcohol, but Nick has a slower transition. Both George and Martha quickly flip between extreme outbursts and more calm moments. It's remarkable how effectively the actors capture these quick flips in mood. \n\nI personally did not enjoy Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, but I recognize it is not because the film did something wrong. This film is clearly looking to make a statement to married couples, or those who have been through difficult marriages. This is not a subject that I can effectively relate to, so I feel little connection to the character's struggles. However, I did clearly feel there emotions, and understood the each moment of the character's struggles. While the story was not for me, I still see how effectively it was communicated. \n\nI don't feel that Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Is a movie for everyone. This film will appeal to those looking for impressive acting performances, or those interested in extreme marital issues.",

This film sort of falls in the middle for me because it goes on for far too long and belabors the points it makes but at the same time I did see moments of excellence shining through in the writing and performances. In the 53 years since it's release this film has built up quite the reputation and while I do not think that it is one of the 100 greatest films of all time I do acknowledge that it is a unique film. I wouldn't say that I think this film is worthy of recommendation because I don't really like it or even admire it that much but most people will probably find their way to it at some point in their lives.\n\nA drunken and mentally unstable Martha, Elizabeth Taylor, and her professor husband George, Richard Burton, terrorize young couple, Nick, George Segal, and Honey, Sandy Dennis, over a long night spent playing \u2018games'. It is slowly revealed that because Martha and George were incapable of having children they invented a fictional son and they use the idea of him to attack one another constantly. They also delve into the problems in the marriage of the younger couple as it is recognized that Nick was forced into the marriage and slightly resents his wealthy wife. Eventually Nick and Honey are allowed to go as it sets in just how sad and lonely Martha and George's lives are.\n\nThe most acclaimed part of the film are the performances as Taylor gives arguably her most iconic turn, Dennis won an Academy Award, Segal had his career launched and Burton solidified his status as one of the great actors of the 1960s. I didn't feel that their performances were extraordinary as I could have seen a lot of actors giving performances on the level that they do and possibly exceeding them but they are all good enough to keep us engaged. I think Burton works better with his long monologues than Taylor does as he brings a great physicality and comic defensiveness to the role where she can feel a little one note. I would have awarded Best Actress to Ida Kaminska for her performance in The Shop on Main Street (1965) and Best Supporting Actress to Geraldine Page for You're a Big Boy Now (1966) because she's possibly the weakest actor in the film.\n\nI like Mike Nichols as a director as I think that The Graduate (1967), Silkwood (1983) and Primary Colors (1998) are all very good films but I don't think this is his strongest work. He gets the claustrophobia and the tension just right in some scenes as Martha goes on a rambling monologue while George reads over her as the young couple watch on in fear. Where he loses it though is including so much of the play as this is a film that really doesn't have to be so long and I would have been much happier seeing a film that was only 90 minutes long, or even less. Most films could do with being cut down and seeing as how this film is so repetitive it really deserves that treatment. He brings more lightness and yet more introspection to The Graduate (1967) which is a much better film.\n\nI think that 1966 may have been one of the weakest years in cinema history because I don't like A Man for All Seasons (1966) and I feel lukewarm about this one therefore I can't say that this is one of those great or even good years in film. Maybe in a few years I will decide to watch this film again although I doubt I will and I will discover that it actually is as brilliant as everybody says it is and I have been missing out on true greatness by not seeing everything this film has to offer. I was left nonplussed which is disappointing when considering the regard that this film is held in and I find that rather unforgivable.",

            "content": "The adaptation to the screen of the play by Edward Albee is a violent experience, unpleasantly overwhelming, of an inclement intensity with the spectator who has agreed to enter the game of the theatricality of the staging. Who fears Virginia Woolf? (1966) was a sudden and triumphant start in film for Mike Nichols, who had gone from being one of the most successful comedians in American theater, in his duo with Elaine May, to one of his favorite directors.\n\nIn full theatrical glory, he accepted the proposal to adapt Albee to the cinema, reuniting on the set the star duo Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton, already duly married after his overexposure adulterous romance. The critical and commercial success of his debut (which garnered five Oscars out of a total of 13 nominations) opened for Nichols the race for which he would ultimately be more massively popular.\n\nThe staging of Who fears Virginia Woolf? it does not seek to disguise that it is a play directed by a theater man. The dialogues being the engine of the text, Nichols leaned on an already brilliant cast to make them glow. Otherwise, if something is worth the data, two of the Oscar cited were for Taylor and the secondary actress Sandy Dennis. But it is a play in the cinema, with the tools of cinema. To try to isolate the participants of the huis-clos, the Haskell Wexler camera (another Oscar more) resorts without complexes to the movements, insisting with the closed planes even more in the unsustainable emotional charge. The staging thus offers a space of artifice that becomes the only possibility of respite from the intensity of what is represented.\n\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\nThe unbearable dynamics of Taylor and Burton's couple, whose motor seems to work with alcohol, is even harder because of the manifest link with reality. But more than an exhibitionist gesture, it is a gesture of humility of two titans who want to show that they are because of their talent rather than their glamor. Here they strive to be ugly, with characters taking refuge from their poignant vulnerability behind a shield of meanness, cruelty and baseness. In the splendor of their physical attractiveness, the actors compose through decadence, suppressing all the grace of their beauty to embody bodies -and souls- in disgrace. George and Martha live in that insufferably closed universe of American suburban colleges. He is a history teacher, but his career has been far less dazzling than expected. She is the daughter of the president of the university, an omnipresent detail in the relationship.\n\nThat night (because everything happens during one night), when they return late from a party at the home of the father-boss, she announces that they have guests, that her father asked her to distract a young couple newly installed on campus. When Nick and Honey appear (George Segal and Sandy Dennis), they are in the middle of the battlefield. If Martha tries to be detestable, George does not settle into the position of victim but tries to equalize his level. Soon the possible vision - which would allow him to take sides and thus to know where he is standing - of him as the reasonable element, attacked by the gratuitous malice of his wife, is annulled. No, no one wants to be a victim, but players of a game in which they will do anything to win.\n\nThe guests, also quite drunk (before the four decidedly drunk), unbalance and rebalance the game, and are potentially almost as perverse as their hosts, in a permanent mutation of rivalries and complicities that no one seems to control. A theme crosses everything and concentrates the greatest tension: the son to which they allude from the beginning in a threatening tone. The son who, although they do not know where he is, thinks that he will appear the next day to celebrate his sixteen years. The son that seems to be the only taboo in his dirty war where every attack is allowed.\n\nDuring an entire night (131 minutes of film) punctuated by various crises, dialogues, monologues and explosions, the tension barely relents for a moment before starting again. The rhythm is not made to accommodate the viewer and allow a real relaxation, but to make him feel the discomfort. In one of her hardest roles as a castrating woman, Elizabeth Taylor shines with the ferocity, the noxiousness and the hypnotic fire of an erupting volcano, and naturally transforms into the center of gravitation of the sick microcosm.",

The film centers around a middle aged married couple, namely George (played by Richard Burton) and Martha (played by Elizabeth Taylor). The screenplay was based on an adaptation of the play by the same name, written by Edward Albee. Taylor, who depicts the wife Martha, shocks the audience with her unpredictable temperament towards the husband George who, on the other hand, lands his jabs through a series of backhanded and passive-aggressive comments aimed at back  his wife. The two continuously go after each other during a late night drinking session with a colleague from the college George works at and his wife. The couples verbal volatility is all the more spurred on by their terrible drinking habits, which enable the two to berate each other over their failing marriage. Martha, the daughter of the president the university, resents George for his inability to succeed at the university. The remainder of the film track George and Martha, alongside their younger coupled friends, as the group examines the negative sides of marriage mainly through extended dialogue. \nBy showing the failing marriage of George and Martha alongside their younger counterparts, Nichol\u00ef\u00bf 1/2 1/2 1/2(TM)s highlights the challenges that uniquely face older married couples.

George shortly later finds out that Martha invited guests over for that night whom are new faculty members.  Once Nick and Honey arrive at the home, the mood immediately becomes unsettling and everyone begins to become intoxicated.  After just a short while of George and Martha bickering, Nick and Honey are tempted to leave but George insists against that.  After that the two couples continue to talk and get to know each other a little better followed by each question and conversation.  There are two things the viewer feels while watching the film up to this point, the sense that Martha has a crush on Nick and George and Martha should not be married.  In the middle of dancing and singing, Honey gets sick and Martha follows.  Everyone is in the home at this point is extremely intoxicated.  While Honey lays on the kitchen floor, passed out drunk and George helping her, Martha and Nick start hooking up.  After the hook up rooms into the other room, George sits with his drink and imagines that a message came that his son has just died.  After Nick failed to perform in the bedroom, Martha is irritated and George delvers the news.  Martha, even more enflamed than the failed affair, screamed at George that was not his decision to make.  George snapped back telling her that she cheated and told Nick and Honey about their son.  At which point Nick knows that the son has been made up all along.  Nick and Honey proceeds to leave George and Martha without any more imaginations of their beloved, made up, son. \n\n\nProduction highlights (positive or negative):\n\nThe highlight of this film was definitely the climax.  This is when George tried to strangle Martha in front of Nick and Honey.  All intoxicated of course, this shows how drunk or sober the couple was it never dulled their hatred for each other. \n\nOverall Recommendation:\n\nI would recommend this movie to someone or a couple who is looking for a classic, black and white, film.  It was honestly a great film and the acting was superb.  \n\nConclusion: \n\nI really liked this film.  Mostly due to the fact the camera angles changed all the time, mostly in close shots.  This gave me an exciting feeling throughout the duration of the film.",

The film was an adaptation of the play \u00e2~Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u00e2(TM) authored by Edward Albee. It first aired in 1966. The movie starts off with a married couple in their 40s named George and Martha, walking down the road to their house late at night. George, played by Richard Burton, and Martha, played by Elizabeth Taylor are constantly arguing throughout every scene of the film. George is a history professor at a University in a city called New Carthage. Martha\u00e2(TM)s father is the president of the same University. One evening after getting home from a faculty party late at night, Martha alerts George as he is getting ready for bed that they are having guests over shortly. Little to George\u00e2(TM)s knowledge, Martha invited over a young new biology professor and his wife to their house, whom she met briefly earlier in the evening. As they are waiting for their guests, Martha and George continue to fight and argue over seemingly random topics; such as reminding her the name of a famous film. Martha is a very aggressive outspoken rude woman, which is only perpetuated by her excessive drinking. She seems to be seeking conflict with almost every word she speaks. Which after a certain point is only met with aggression from her husband as a response to her incendiary comments to him. The couple arrives shortly after notifying George of their pending guests. Nick is a young biology professor played by George Segal. His wife Honey, is played by Sandy Dennis. Nick is a tall hansom 28 year old whom Martha finds attractive. The reason for her inviting them over remains unclear. Honey, Nick\u00e2(TM)s wife is a frail 26 year old woman. Immediately after they arrive, large cocktails are made for them. Over the next several scenes there is a tremendous amount of banter between Martha and George which make Nick and Honey uncomfortable. As they slowly get more drunk the hysterics rise further. \n\nGeorge and Martha are playing out some strange game within their relationship fueled by anger, while using this couple as a conduit. Slowly this seemingly nice young couple is pulled into George and Martha\u00e2(TM)s drama. Martha continues to flirt with Nick while his wife has become very intoxicated. George decides to dance with Honey spinning her around to the point that she has to vomit, and runs to the bathroom. Martha goes to take care of Honey in the bathroom while Nick and George play mind games and have malicious conversations in the backyard while drinking bourbon. George is able to learn more about Nick, so that he may use this information against him later. George is even upfront yet tricky about his intentions while talking with Nick. Martha yells out the front door about making coffee, George and Nick come back into the house after exchanging curses to each other. Once they arrive back inside, Honey is in the hallway telling them that Martha has gone upstairs to change into something more comfortable. Additionally, Honey asks George about his son, whom Martha told Honey about, explicitly against Georges request earlier in the night. This sparks something in George where he is now willing to play the \u00e2~game\u00e2(TM) Martha is trying to win at. \n\nOnce Martha comes downstairs she is all dressed up to go out. After several arguments between everyone it is decided that they will offer Nick and Honey a ride home. George is very drunk at this point and swerves while driving them home. The subject of dancing comes up in the car and they drive passed a sign of a bar which has music and dancing. Further arguments occur in the car before they decide to go for some dancing and one drink. Once they arrive at the bar Honey and George sit down and have a drink while Nick and Martha dance inappropriately. Martha continues over the whole film to give George a very hard time and often points out failures and inadequacies he has in her eyes. While they are at the bar dancing Martha decides to tell everyone about a book George attempted to publish, but her father prevented its publication. This highly embarrassing moment to George pushes him passed the edge as he pleads with her not to talk about the subject. Everyone gets into a huge argument as tensions rise. George in retaliation to Martha\u00e2(TM)s actions verbally responds by telling everyone the private story he was able to get from Nick when he was drunk in the backyard. This story is about Honey and Nicks marriage, and is very upsetting to Honey. Nick storms out of the bar after Honey as they try and walk home from the bar. Martha and George continue arguing till they declare they are now in a \u00e2full war\u00e2? against each other. Martha runs for the car and drives off after Nick and Honey, leaving George to walk home. Martha catches up with the couple and drives them back to her house. George finally arrives back at his house to find Honey laying on the lawn outside while Nick and Martha commit adultery upstairs.\nCONT...",

George and Martha played by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton invite a new young Professor along with his wife over for after party drinks. Martha and George are in an unhappy, toxic, and spiteful marriage. It doesn\u00e2(TM)t take much to get on each other\u00e2(TM)s nerves. Once the new couple Nick and Honey arrive George and Martha start playing games with one another to spite each other. The hateful couple eventually resort to bringing the new couple into their games. As the night moves along the games get darker and darker. George at one instance leaves the room to grab a gun, creeps up behind Martha, Nick, and Honey. George then points a gun at the back of Martha\u00e2(TM)s head. Honey turns her head screams once she notices the gun. As soon as Nick and Martha turn to look at why Honey screamed, George pulls the trigger and the gun fires out an umbrella.

Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are a real married couple and that relationship really helps them perform to the best of their abilities in this film. The monologuing in \u00e2Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u00e2? is top notch. This was a film I did not think I was going to enjoy but the constant back and forth of the deranged couple kept me engaged the whole time. This film deserves every single award that it has received. I would recommend this movie to any one that wants to watch a highly entertaining film that has a great combo of drama and sarcastic comedy.",

The film is based on Edward Albee\u00e2(TM)s play, which takes place primarily in the living room of married couple George and Martha. After attending a faculty party, Martha tells George that she has invited George\u00e2(TM)s co-worker Nick and his wife Honey back to the house for drinks. Upon their arrival, the chaos begins as both Martha and George disregard the fact that they have company and consistently take jabs at each other and bicker in-front of them. Their dysfunctional, toxic relationship is further fueled by the excessive amount of alcohol they consume \u00e2\" a recipe for disaster. Through late into evening, matters only get worse. George makes several comments to Nick to upset him, while Honey is incredibly intoxicated and lacks complete awareness for everything that\u00e2(TM)s going on around her. In all the chaos that takes place throughout the long evening, there are two significant events that take place that I think are really symbolic of how toxic Martha and George\u00e2(TM)s relationship is: 1. The couple tells their company that they have a son which is far from the truth and a topic that to both is very sensitive. In all reality, this is a story that they have made up due to their infertility. 2. After a really bad fight at the bar, Martha drives off in a rage with Nick and intoxicated Honey. However, back at the house, the flirting between Nick and Martha lead to them having extramarital affairs. Once George makes it back to the house, he realizes what is taking place and in revenge, he later tells Martha in-front of Nick and Honey that their son is dead. Something that seems to upset Martha very much. \n\nIn the end, despite all the drama and fighting that has taken place Martha admits that the only man that has truly made her happy is indeed George. The only one that accepts her the way she is, is good to her and even when she does not want to be happy, he makes her happy. A clear depiction of a couple that is madly in love but are completely wrong for being together and bring the worse out of each other.\n\nProduction Highlights:\n\nIn doing some research on the background and production of this film, the best production highlight is how Elizabeth Taylor and Mike Burton were able to truly deliver an incredible performance of their characters. Based on the fact that they were married when this was filmed, their previous relationship and love for alcohol, it\u00e2(TM)s clear that all these factors contributed to such stellar performance on both of their parts. I also think that the fact that the movie was filmed in black and white for the sole purpose for emphasizing the darkness of Martha and George\u00e2(TM)s relationship and the events that took place was pure genius!!! Finally, in most of the scenes where George and Martha fight, I noticed that the camera would zoom into each character to capture the raw emotion and make an impact on the viewer. For example, in the beginning of the movie when Martha jumps on George and she is signing \u00e2Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?\u00e2? she has very exaggerated movements and the camera moves in and we can see how drunk and obnoxious she\u00e2(TM)s being. The same happens towards the end when George gets home and as he stars laughing sarcastically, he walks back out and starts crying. Other highlights include, the facts that Elizabeth Taylor put on 20lbs to play the part and adjusted her tone of voice to sound annoying, intoxicated, obnoxious and to an extent evil-like. All great ideas by the production team.\n\nOverall Recommendation/Conclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this movie. It\u00e2(TM)s very clear to see why this movie won 5 Oscars and was nominated for 8 others. Something that is unheard of. Although the story line is quite dramatic and dark, in all reality I think it\u00e2(TM)s something that many of the audience can relate to one way or another. Elizabeth Taylor is absolutely incredible, and once again proves what an outstanding actress she was. If the movie is this good, I would love to see Edward Albee\u00e2(TM)s play in theater. I think it\u00e2(TM)s definitely something to watch.",

The main actors are Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, produced in the United States. The main plot of the film is that the young couple came to George and Martha to be a guest, portraying the family conflict between George and Martha, and the contradictions between George and Nick and Nick and Honey. The film has a lot of highlights: 1. Elizabeth Taylor's outstanding acting, her performance is very exciting. 2. The film won 13 Oscar nominations and is the only film in history that has been fully nominated. 3. The film's director is the director of \"Graduate\". The film was launched in 1966. The \"Graduate\" was launched in 1967. The director twice nominated Oscar for best director and won the best director in two years. I am very impressed with him. I think that this film, and graduates, have a connection between the two, both of which show a kind of nothingness and confusion. Whether in this movie, the child that Martha and George fantasized, or Dustin Hoffman, after getting married and sitting in the car in the new year, turned from laughter to confusion, which profoundly showed a kind of nothingness. The emptiness of marriage. Because this film is a stage play adaptation, there is a strong sense of stage, which combines a sense of absurdity. The child in this fantasy is a bit like Godot in Waiting for Godot, also as Hitchcock said. MacGuffin. The Martha are in a sense of oppression, which is related to the age of the film in 1966, and 1966 is the peak of the Cold War. Therefore, the social collective subconscious has a sense of oppression, which is also shown in the film works. In this movie, there is a kind of conflict, sarcasm in marriage and violence in speech; breaking all the good illusions into the early morning. Under the sane appearance, all the characters have collapsed at the end. I generally recommend this movie, which is a movie that people who consider marriage should watch.",

From the start of the movie there is obvious tension between the couple, George, a history professor, and Martha, his wife and the daughter of the President at the college where George teaches.  As the couple returns home from a faculty event speaking loudly and experiencing difficulties walking - all signs of already having a bit too much to drink, the other shoe drops when Martha surprises George with the news that she invited a young couple, Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) over for drinks.  Nick is a tall, blonde, handsome, intelligent, and well-educated new biology professor who in his eagerness to climb the academia ladder as fast as possible, is viewed as a threat by George both professionally and personally.  His wife, Honey, the daughter of a preacher who married Nick under the claim of a false pregnancy, appears to be in la-la land not understanding the conversations and wishing to remain in denial of the night's events.  George and Martha, perceived as well-mannered hosts, lose control of their inhibitions and go literally at each other's throats in front of the young couple.  This one-night of casual drinks at 2am in the morning quickly turns into turmoil as George and Martha create a hostile and uncomfortable environment for their guests.  Determined to play a series of games, George and Martha's irrational and drunken behaviors will keep you wondering how their antics and games will end and who in the room will be the next casualty as each of the couple's most inner secrets come to light.  Some of the scenes show both George and Martha yelling, insulting, and degrading each other where the signs of an unhappy, stressed, troubled couple rise to crumble the illusion of their perceived happy marriage.  There is more violence than loving moments as George and Martha insult each other and often times swear and use euphemisms with sexual undertones inappropriate for adolescents.  Nichols' use of close and angled shots captures the perturbed beaten faces of the actors in pain and disarray as voices get loud and continue to rise as George and Martha become violent with each other. Filmed in the 1960's, it is a black and white picture where lighting is dark and characters are visible by moonlight or a light pole when outside. Elizabeth Taylor, a beautiful and highly visible actor at the time of filming, transforms into a frumpy older woman who definitely has more grit and teeth than her awkwardly beaten down, submissive husband with pent up anger ready to be let out.  The off-screen power couple bring all their might to the screen resulting in many accolades and a movie which is one for the books of history.  Elizabeth Taylor won an Academy Award.  The movie, based on Edward Albee's 1962 play, earned him a Tony Award in 1962.  Subsequently, Mike Nichols earned an Academy Award in the Best Director category.  A love-hate relationship played out in a messy living room and in the presence of a younger couple which is worth grabbing a seat for so that you can determine for yourself who is really afraid of Virginia Woolf - Nichols, Taylor and Burton do not disappoint!

            "content": "Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a brilliant film adaptation of Edward Albee\u00e2(TM)s original play. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton embraced the characters of Martha and George in a way that was pivotal for character development on screen. It is clear that the fact that Taylor and Burton were married in real life contributed to the way they were able to bicker and interact on screen. The choice to only have four characters throughout the entire film makes the audience focus in on the dynamics, interactions, and development between each and of each character. We see Martha and George invite over the other two characters, Nick and Honey to their home. This then begins the interactions that portray the unhappy, bickering, ugly couple that is George and Martha when compared to younger, more in love couple Nick and Honey. The film continues through these interactions, where Martha and George get their guests caught up more and more with their antics, fights, and drama between each other. \nFilm director Mike Nichols did an incredible job making a somewhat lacking for action film feel full of action. This film is essentially just the interactions between the four characters we see, but delves deep into their development, issues, and dramas that becomes incredibly exciting and puts you on the edge of your seat since the characters have so much going on. Nichols had impeccable directing techniques with this film, especially the way certain shots were films; they added an extra layer of chaos and drama to the story. This film also takes on a very controversial aspect for its time that adds to the brilliance of the film. There was a lot of swearing, fighting, and drama that were very controversial with the audiences. This film embraces that women can be just as abusive and fight just as much as men can. This aspect from having Martha have the lines such as \u00e2goddamn you\u00e2? really embraced the resentment and abuse Martha would have towards her husband. This film also was shot in black and white, which adds to why it is so well done. The black and white adds an aspect to force the audience to focus on the characters and reflects the feelings of the characters rather than having flashy colors and surroundings that do not embrace this.\nOverall, the storyline, direction, and especially acting of this film made it what it is; an incredibly brilliant and well done film that has impeccable character development and interactions that do not bore the audience.",

            "content": "Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf showcases the physically and emotionally violent and manipulative behaviors of couple Martha and George, and its effects on their guests Honey and Nick. \nThe threadline of George\u00e2(TM)s instability in Who\u00e2(TM)s Afraid of Virginia Woolf was consistent in stylistic choices, which I enjoyed very much. His instability is shown throughout the film in swirling motions. First, the light fixture in the closet swirls around his head while he searches for the fake gun. The second time this is seen, he spins around on the swing while he speaks to Nick incoherently. The final time this is shown is when he begins walking back to his house after Martha abandons him, with shadows moving over his face in a visually uncomfortable way. The consistency of this theme of swirling equating to instability in George\u00e2(TM)s character was wonderful to see. It allowed me to acquire an insight on when George was unstable. I will also mention that this was portrayed so nicely and with such great clarity due to the great cinematography seen in those instances, as well as throughout the film.\nAnother stylistic choice I really like in this film is the use of breaking the 4th wall. I found this film\u00e2(TM)s use of this tool to be very clever and gripping. I enjoyed the fact that it was always George breaking the 4th wall, and that as the movie progressed he addressed the audience more directly. I found it really wonderful how he walked toward the camera in one of these instances. I also enjoyed that he looked, very informally, to the camera to explain to us that things were going as he thought they would be. I have to say, this may have been my favorite thing about the film. \nI loved that there was great thought put into the placement of people and props. For instance, I found it very nice that Martha said \u00e2what a dump\u00e2? and immediately following this she is seen tossing things around and therein creating her own disorganization, An instance of my likeness of the placement of people is when Martha is seen at the beginning of the film talking to George (as opposed to talking with him) while sitting very high up on the cabinet. Later in the film, George is seen sitting above Martha while she is on the couch and he is sitting on the side of the couch, These thoughtful placements of people and props aided in this feeling of things coming full circle and of questions being answered without being spoken about. \nAnother instance of intentional placement that I enjoyed was the placement of the camera behind characters. This happens twice in the film, and in both instances, it is very gripping. I provided the sense that I was seeing what they were seeing; that I was experiencing what they were, as opposed to watching what they were doing. When Martha is very drunk, I saw blurry, unstable camerawork that showcased how drunk she was. \nI really enjoyed that there was a lack of filmscore. I found that this was in line with Edward Albee\u00e2(TM)s preference that he doesn\u00e2(TM)t want to be told how to react to things through music. I do agree with Albee that the use of film score at the final scene of the film created a sentimental atmosphere, which was contrary to the intent of the writing. If anything, I found that moment to possess a great irony as a result of the film score. \nI liked that the lack of film score allowed for moments, such as is seen in the ballroom, to be really powerful. I found the writing to be wonderful here. Instead of having the film score guide my reaction to what I saw, I heard the shouting of what was happening in one word. Honey shouted \u00e2violence!\u00e2?, Martha proclaimed \u00e2we\u00e2(TM)re quiet now\u00e2?, George stated \u00e2total war\u00e2?, and Honey said \u00e2bells ringing.\u00e2? It gave me the impression that there was a new chapter beginning and these words were the titles of them. \nI enjoyed viewing this film very much. I did not find that this film showcased an enduring love or a happy ending. I found that, at the final scene, these characters were reflecting on their behaviors together, and that their bond lied there in their shared disturbed nature.",

            "content": "Who is Afraid of Virginia Wolf is a brilliant film centered on the dangers of illusion that was directed by Mike Nichols. The screenplay was written by Earnest Lehman and it was produced by Edward Albee. The two stars of the film are Elizabeth Taylor, who played Martha and Richard Burton as George. These two actors were a real-life couple, which is how they were able to channel raw emotion into their performances. They truly put on a show with their portrayal of how emotional dependence can ignite a distorted reality. What do I mean by this? Well, it all starts one disturbing night when the couple Martha and George return home from a faculty party. They invite another couple Nick and Honey over for drinks. Over the course of the night, Martha and George begin to go at it, verbally abusing one another, Martha violently verbally attacking her guests as well. At first, Nick and Honey seem horrified, but with alcohol in their systems, begin to mirror Martha and George\u00e2(TM)s behavior, as repressed emotions of the past come out. \n\nThey begin to play games with Nick and Honey, which truly reveal the troubling reality of their psyches.  The underlying issue and explosion erupts when talking about Martha and George\u00e2(TM)s imaginary son Nick, whose birthday is the next day. The production highlight for me was when George reveals to Martha that Nick is dead; this is the climax of the film. Here, we see a change in demeanor and their illusion is crushed. It is very well acted. It helped create an analysis for one of the main themes in the film, which is the struggle between reality and illusion. In my opinion, it is the illusion of their son Nick that keeps George and Martha\u00e2(TM)s marriage alive. It is hard to decipher what is reality and what is an illusion throughout the film because to Martha and George, they really believe the illusion, which makes the audience believe as well. There is also a conflict of love and hate. The couple really seem to hate each other, with few moments of love and tenderness throughout the entire film. Although, we do see the love still sometimes, which says something. I am still trying to figure out if it is love or just them needing each other. This movie has won many awards in the industry, so I would definitely recommend checking it out. But, just know that you\u00e2(TM)re in for immense vulgarity and indescribable weirdness.",

            "content": "- Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? I am. -\n\nOkay, so here's the thing, I studied physical education at university. I know, right? Weird choice for someone deeply obsessed with film. After two years of studying the wrong thing, I abruptly quit physical education and studied film and media instead. And excitingly, after making that decision, I was then allowed in the film archive section of the university library. This was all before Netflix, when we still had DVDs.\n\nOn the days that I wasn't drinking studying, I would go to the top floor and slowly make my way through all of the classic films. It didn't matter if they had anything to do with my film classes, I watched as many as I could. That's when I stumbled upon Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and I absolutely lost my mind.\nWhat a masterpiece! And because I believe it is so brilliant, I need to focus on only a couple of its best features, otherwise, I will totally blow out my word count.\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was originally a play written by Edward Albee in 1965. It was then adapted into a film, directed by Mike Nichols and it stars the real life married couple Elizabeth Taylor (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof) and Richard Burton (Cleopatra). Burton plays George, an associate professor of history, and Taylor plays Martha, his wife and the daughter of the president of the university.\n\nAfter a party one night, Martha invites an attractive young couple back to their house for drinks because \"daddy said we should be nice to them\".  From there, the night unfolds from inner to exterior turmoil for the four featured characters. I felt like I was being dragged kicking and screaming into a fight and I felt super fucken uncomfortable about the whole thing.\n\nOut of all four characters, it was Martha that captured my attention from beginning to devastating end. I credit Elizabeth Taylor for not only making Martha unforgettable but making her one of the most fascinatingly unlikeable and misunderstood characters ever to grace the silver screen.\n\nTaylor was 32 years old at the time and with prosthetics, an added 30 pounds of weight, and a deepened voice, she encapsulated a 52 year old Martha. It was such a transformation from being one of the most beautiful women in the world.\n\nI remember thinking that even though she was caked in makeup and prosthetics, she couldn't hide her famous eyes. And as much as I wanted to lose Elizabeth Taylor in her character, it was impossible to completely forget her. This truthfully added a layer of authenticity to the character of Martha because, in reality, Elizabeth Taylor was an alcoholic who often fought with her husband and co-star.\n\nSo out of all the inspiring women-protagonists in the world, why do I love a drunken, verbally abusive, manipulative woman? Because simply, she was a woman in pain. We can all relate to pain. The difference is how we react to it.\n\nMartha chose a path of bitterness and regret, and she took it out on her husband, as he did with her. And not to give away too much, it is the pain that comforted her. This \"thing\" became the one good thing in her life that helped her to continue living.\n\nSo even though I detested her character, I couldn't really judge her choices. I can't judge someone on how they deal with their pain. But I can learn from it. I can learn who I don't want to become. And so this character of Martha is truly inspirational in the best way. She makes me not want to be like her.\n\nElizabeth Taylor won a second Oscar for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? And she said that her performance as Martha was the best of her career. Not all women-protagonists have to be heroines for us to connect with them. They can be the misfits and anti-heroes of the stories as well. They can be the forgotten house-wives in an unhappy marriage. Those are the characters that can shake you and dishevel whatever safe place you have inside you.  \n\nFor me, Martha is one of the most brilliantly written characters I have read and seen. One of my favorite lines in the film is said by Martha, \"I am George, I am\". It will make absolutely no sense for someone who hasn't seen Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? but when you do watch it, I want you to focus on the weight those words have for Martha. Just feel how everything in the two and half hours of sheer debauchery, verbal and physical abuse led to these words having so much resonance and how brilliantly Taylor delivers them.\n\n----------\n\nThis review was first published on Narrative Muse, http://www.narrativemuse.co/movies/whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf, and was written by Jules Raynes.

            "content": "This gorgeously ghastly drama is a must-see masterpiece, unparalleled in its haunting delivery of manic, mounting tension and its harrowing explosions of drink-infused bitterness and insanity.\n\nMike Nichols' spellbinding film drops all-time acting greats Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton right in the middle of a Shakespearean-grade study of alcoholism. Burton and Taylor spit daggers at one another, each sharper and shriller than the last - the sense of history and sheer bitterness between their characters evoking an air of authenticity seldom seen on screen.\n\nBut Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is much more than a showcase for some of cinema's best acting and bitterest dialogue. In fact, the note-perfect coupling of Taylor and Burton is but a bonus factor in a film that offers an eerie exploration of the link between drunkenness and insanity, punching as opposed to poking the creaky boundary between the two at every opportunity.\n\nOn the surface, Nichols' film is a piercing theatrical melodrama. Underneath, it is a psychological thriller, a ghost story, a black comedy, a brutal romance and more. In fact, one might argue that the film offers one of the richest, most honest and resonating commentaries on the age-old concept of true love that the screen has ever seen.",

            "content": "Mike Nichols' original masterpiece, as much a horror as it was a comedy and a literary tragedy. This movie forced American cinema to grow up and embrace not only darker subtext and more profane subject mater, but also morally ambiguous concepts.  While I'm sure Edward Albee didn't invent literary comprehension on screen, the creative team here certainly were the first to pioneer the concept to Hollywood - still stuck in the golden era.\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was not only controversial for its day (one of the movies that helped bury the Hayes Code) but also a wonderfully warped mind trip that is still shocking almost 50 years after the fact. The movie has multiple layers of depraved entertainment; it is a marriage farce, a battle of old time wits (Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor at their most imprudent), a coarse perspective of relationship counseling, and of course, it has a plot twist so brutal, you'll never play games at the dinner table again. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? has two things going for it: it's based on a play by Edward Albee (the best scripted films are always based on plays) and it's directed by Mike Nichols who has an enormous sensitivity when he's directing couples on screen. This PG rated drama is still the most disturbed thing you'll see in any given month.\n\nWhat I Learned: I really think Edward Albee and Mike Nichols' creation is where I got some of my harsh and caustic wit. Of course, I always thought really disturbed and funny things in my own head, but until Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf I never knew it could be so deliciously fun to torment people with using only your quick-witted mind. There was great sadism in this sarcasm and it helped me realize there is no need to bite your tongue-at least not in art.",

It has the unavoidable stage to screen difficulty of containing way too much dialogue shooting off in all directions. It works well in the theatre when you're more able to absorb yourself into the situation, but in the cinema its frustratingly alienating, and ramps up the films runtime to over 2 hours. The arguments, which drive the entire plot, are acidic, deeply personal and must've been hugely shocking at the time. It's a lot tamer nowadays, full of barbs you'll see every day on all the worst realty TV shows. But what makes the whole experience so effective is the acting. All 4 principle actors are so natural that you'd never think they were acting, particularly Elizabeth Taylor, who throws her drunken, bitter weight around in a career-defining performance. It's principle problem, as I've hinted at before, is that its non-stop verbal sparring becomes wearisome about half an hour before the credits roll, and if only some of the dialogue had been cut it would be much better to watch. With that said, it's a vicious examination of marital discord and gender politics, and it's stood the test of time on the strength of its acting, directing and acerbic wit.",

When I saw this on DirecTV from TCM, I was thinking about how I've heard about this movie for a while, but I haven't got to see it for the first time, especially since it's the first film from director Mike Nichols. So with no information, I just decide to watch it, and was deeply surprised of what I gotten out of it. All of the actors gave a powerhouse performance as all of them did a fantastic job as they give a different part of their own and just steal the show from what they got, especially since the movie is all about those four, so they have to give it all they need to get. The writing by Ernest Lehman is at it's A game as it's spot-on, and it feels more natural for the fact that Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were married at the time. The movie can go in two ways, whether it be a dark comedy about two couples going at each other, or a drama that feels like a horror from how relatable it is from couples that might act like this, and it shows it from both sides as it has some dark humor in it that's funny, or it can be uncomfortable in an unnerving way that does way better at portraying argument couples than This is 40 as you were suppose to like those characters that it feels really awkward to see them argue when they can be a good couple, in this, the beginning starts with them arguing already, but the tone keeps it consistent with the film that it's actually being serious about where it's going, and the viewers liking them or not is their own choice, the movie wasn't leaning towards one side. It interesting to hear them curse so much as during the old days of cinema, there wasn't much of them saying those kind of profanity because there's a tight relationship going on with the MPAA about it. I was interested in what's going on with their arguments, and I have learn about the characters as it goes on. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a fantastic film that it really showcases the acting in this that's thanks to the direction by the late Mike Nichols.",

It's the kind of movie they should show to couples planning a divorce, not to talk them out of it, but so they can appreciate how annoying it is when they bicker in front of other people. I suppose the acting is good, in between the screaming and drunken rambling. I suppose there's artistry in capturing on film something so obnoxious, but I don't have the proper mentality to appreciate it. It doesn't help that the way they talk to one another is so artificial and scripted. This isn't how real people interact, and it certainly wouldn't be how they'd interact under the extreme influences of alcohol. Even the most convincing performance in the world doesn't feel genuine when I can see the dialogue written out on a script page, but can't imagine them coming from someone's lips. This is clearly a stage play translated to screen, by some writer who understands emotions but not how real people express them. I'm not sure if the climax of all this screaming is intended to be a surprise, but I saw it coming hours before they verbalized it. Perhaps if anything of significance happened in this film it would have interested me at least slightly, but imagine my surprise when I realized it was merely 2 hours of bickering. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is only for the masochistic person who enjoys watching the demise of another couples' relationship. I was delighted when it ended.",

They're arm-in-arm and seemingly all is quiet and right with the world.  The second the action starts, when Liz Taylor flicks on the light and we begin hearing her talk with Richard Burton, we know all is definitely not right.  And thus begins 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'.\n\nThe two play a college history professor and his wife, who is also the dean's daughter, and we quickly come to know that they are (a) very unhappy and frustrated with one another, (b) highly blunt and sarcastic in expressing this, and (c) functioning alcoholics.  The first scene which lasts something like 50 minutes and has a younger professor and his wife (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) coming over to drinks is absolutely stunning.  The script and Taylor and Burton's performances are outstanding.   Humiliation, flirting with the opposite sex, telling stories and confusing \"truth and illusion\" to play mind games with the other are the order of the day, and the two serve it up again and again in ways which may make your jaw drop.   \n\nThe movie is minimalistic in the sense that it only has these four major characters, two extremely minor characters (who briefly appear when they visit a roadside bar), and it all takes place in a single night, mostly in their home.   However, the performances are explosive and 'larger than life'.  Taylor in particular really put herself out there, because let's face it, putting on weight and acting like a loud, cheap, bully is far more dangerous for a woman than it is for a man.  Images of the SNL sketch from a decade later may come to your mind as she munches on a chicken leg and then carelessly tosses the bone back on the plate in the fridge.  She is absolutely exceptional, and was worthy of the Academy Award she received.  I was also reminded of the power in some of Jennifer Lawrence's recent performances as I watched her, but Taylor takes it to another level.  Burton is also fantastic, trying to remain intellectual and appear above it all, but displaying a frustrated rage within and constantly needling all the three of the other characters.  When he goes out for the rifle in the garage as Taylor is telling an embarrassing story about him and returns with it, we feel serious tension, and I thought first-time director Mike Nichols did a great job here and throughout the movie.\n\nIt loses a teeny bit of momentum towards the middle, and I have to say, the story behind their child, whose apparent death seems to be an explanation for why they've gone a bit kooky, but who has been an imaginary child all along, does not ring true, at least in the emotions it evokes out of each of them.  While it's a symbol of an unrealized dream they share, just as Burton's failure to advance in the hierarchy at the college is, to me this is a weakness in the original play.  The ending, which as them tenderly resigned to one another despite all that bickering and fighting (and bottle breaking, and choking!), is powerful nonetheless.  It's not exactly a feel-good movie, but it's one that will stir you.",

The athmosphere is very well portrayed, all the cast was impeccable all the time, making this, with no doubts, one of the more well acted movies ever, and we have to thank these actors, because they made the movie better than it should be, they made us ask ourselves if the movie is just fiction or if its something real, and that is something very important. The story is very original and the cast make her interesting with their perfect drunk people performances, and with a help of clever dialogues and arguments between the characters, and that unexpected end, this movie could be considered a masterpiece, but I'm afraid that some spectators could not understand the final act because of its confusing plot where don't let us perceive if what they are saying is the truth or not.",

Played to perfection by the four cast members, including Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, you can't help but feel like you are watching the actions of two actual drunk couples. Some of the one liners involved within their chemistry makes you physically laugh aloud forcing you to pay attention as they come out of no where. Just as the scene quietens downs, it doesn't take long for one character to throw a line towards another to get the characters and the viewers alert.\nThe story may not have any form of dramatic conclusion or heavy narrative, but the 2 hours are well spent if it means witnessing the arguments and remarks between an unhappy couple and their new 'friends'.",

            "content": "I had no idea what to expect from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but considering that it was the winner of multiple Academy Awards, it would most likely be a good film.\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? does not deviate far from its stage roots at all. It maintains the appropriate dramatisation of the material and keeps it within a small scale. Everything feels like a stage production but has the credibility and technical qualities of a film.\nTo simplify what I'm saying, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? feels like a stage production because it takes place within few sets and locations which feel genuine and embody the theatrical style of the original play at the same time. Also, the cinematography tends to film things from the audience's perspective which allows a third person view of things, and a lot of the shots are long ones instead of quick ones combined with a lot of editing. The scenery in the film is great and the cinematography captures every inch of it at a nice slow moving pace. The cinematography shifts its focus at a nice speed as well and it constantly keeps things at an interesting perspective.\nAnd as well as capturing the appropriate theatrical style of the film from a technical perspective, it does it from a storytelling perspective just as well because director Mike Nichols ensures that the dramatisation of the story stays true to its roots and that the actors follow on with the same dramatic style, and it is fairly impressive to say that this is his debut as a director of films.\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? has a simple story full of a lot of complex characters attempting to deal with a changing world and the drama that causes them to slowly disintegrate, and thanks to Mike Nichols' handling of the material it proves to be a well paced dramatic feature which harnesses all of his potential and serves as a strong adaptation of the play. Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? finds the fine line between being a cinematic piece and a stage production thanks to his careful direction, and the dramatic effect of the story ends up remaining as strong as the script and renders Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? a strong dramatic experience which is very character-oriented while keeping its focus very broad.\nAs a largely theatrical film, the importance in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? mostly rests on the performances of the cast which are excellent, particularly the Academy Award winning performance of legendary actress Elizabeth Taylor.\nElizabeth Taylor is unrecognisable for her role in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. As she gained 30 pounds for the role and reinvented her look, she doesn't embody the woman deemed the most beautiful woman in the world at the time of the film and instead adopts the look of a simple attractive woman of age, an everywoman. She is recognisable for her role as an actress in the film because her dramatic strength as an actress just steals the screen. Her sharp and dramatic line delivery is matched only by the way she keeps her physicality in tune with her and expresses a lot of her emotions through her facial gestures. She is simply a screen-stealer in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and it is a role significantly different to many others she has taken on. Yet it is one of the greatest of her career, and her strength as a lead actress has done nothing but grow over the years. The genuine way she interacts with the surrounding cast members is incredible, particularly with Richard Burton as their chemistry feels genuine. It is likely that this is true because of the fact that the two shared a complicated relationship in real life, and when it transitions onto the film screen the result is impeccable. Despite looking a lot different in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Elizabeth Taylor is as beautiful as ever and stronger as an actress for taking an Oscar winning lead in the film.\nRichard Burton also gives a strong performance. As Elizabeth Taylor is the one dominating the screen in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Richard Burton has a hell of a platform to step up to. Yet with his immense skill as an actor, he manages to do it. Richard Burton stays on the wrong end of all Martha's criticisms without ever breaking characters as George, and you can see the small elements of his character changing gradually as he develops over the course of the film while the drama unfolds. His line delivery is fierce, and when he sees fit he manages to grab the screen and grip the drama of the film in his hand with an undeniable tenacity. Richard Burton proves what makes him a great actor in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and his lead performance is one of the most tense and powerful efforts of his entire career with an undeniable dramatic effect as the result.\nGeorge Segal's supporting performance is an effective one as well because you can see how he lets his character develop over the course of the film as the dramatic situations grow in intensity, and his facial expressions and line delivery become more and more sharp as things happen which gives the story a good sense of movement.\nLastly, Sandy Dennis' performance as Sunny was a nice touch to the cast as well, and her chemistry with George Segal was very effective. Similarly, you can see the drama of the film gradually taking its toll on her as it develops affects the viewers, making the experience of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? well acted from every contributing cast member.\n\nSo Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a bit of an old film and doesn't break its cinematic roots too much, but the power of the story's dramatic impact and the excellent lead performance from Elizabeth Taylor gives it more than enough credibility to succeed as a memorable feature.",

Richard Burton plays a sullen history professor who's hit a career plateau and Elizabeth Taylor is his middle aged foul mouthed alcoholic wife. Its a perfect example of art imitating life.\r\n\r\nOne night, after attending a college party, they invited a younger couple Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis) to have a drink at their home. \r\nIt is during this nightcap that the family drama begins to develop in full force\r\n\r\nThe simple plot deals with two university couples, one young, one not-so-young, who \"entertain\" each other in the wee hours of the night after a university party. George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) invite a young couple over who just joined the university staff. While George and Martha are old hats at this \"banter\" they have developed, they draw the young couple into their psychological torture chamber resulting in a riveting but exhausting evening of fun and games\r\n\r\nCutting insults keep the viewer awake as do the sometimes embarrassing revelations, like Sandy Dennis's hysterical pregnancies and frequent vomiting. When Albee latches on to what he feels is a good turn of phrase, it gets repeated until it becomes laughable per se. \"It's good that you're a biologist\r\nThe dialog is crisp, biting, caustic, strange, compelling, honest, brutal and thoroughly engrossing. It is disturbing and not for the faint-hearted but is a fascinating look in the dark recesses that make up some relationships. It also demands that you pay close attention to the dialog because this is where you truly find out exactly what this entails.\r\nInsults fly in all directions. One person may reveal a secret to another, who then runs over and trumpets the information to the others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGood close-up takes showing Martha's hysterical grief after George has told her that their son, who in fact never exists, was killed in an accident\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Albee's play is full of the kind of stinging dialog that made it controversial in the 1960s, and today it still retains its potential for hitting its characters on to the audience in a shockingly overwrought and, in connection with this, very funny manner. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis movie is 131 minutes long and only contains 5 actors, on of which hardly gets any screen time and the two leading characters played by the famous couple Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor are on screen almost the whole time. Also this movie only contains a couple of locations so the whole project depends almost entirely on these two actors superb performance. The two of them fight almost the entire movie and it never gets boring for a second. \r\n\r\nThe acting by Taylor and Burton is great.George Segal impresses in his debut.Sandy Dennis,I feel,overplayed her part and came across to me as annoying\r\nBut most of all, the acting is what makes this movie work. Richard Burton especially is hypnotic in his obsessive devotion to whatever pops into his mind, and he has a few speeches in here that he performs so well, it's a shame he didn't win an Oscar for it. However, Taylor is extremely good as well, humorous but not hilarious and entirely convincing. Admittedly, the young couple aren't as big a part of the movie, but nevertheless perform well and are still interesting characters.",

For me, this film has not stood the test of time.  Of the four actors nominated for Oscars in this movie (Elizabeth Taylor and Sandy Dennis won Actress and Supporting Actress respectively) I felt that only Richard Burton was worthy of the nod.  The remaining three cast members swayed between overacting and just plain bad acting.  That this movie was nominated for 13 Oscars is a complete mystery to me.  Best Costume Design?  Really?  Sorry, but this movie doesn't qualify as a classic in my book.  I gave it two stars only because the early part of the movie is very witty and well-written.  The sarcastic banter between George and Martha during this part of the film was quite entertaining.  Other than that, by the end of the movie, I was left wondering what the point of it all was.",

My review for Cloud Atlas was only a paragraph and Leaving Las Vegas was merely a line, which I should try to change for both but they're archived now but alas we're talking about this classic. Again, the film I got and the film I thought I was going to get were different but in this case not that much so. From all I read and saw in the trailer I thought this film would be about a couple who hate each other but like each other after they get drunk and verbally torment their guests for the duration of the film and for the most part I was correct. For a film that's about nothing but dialogue the dialogue had to be good and of course it is! The way the characters spoke is a way that I've never seen people do before or see again. At first I thought it was a bit odd how they were speaking, like it was overly aggressive but before long I realised that the aggressiveness had only just begun. I'm still finding it difficult to believe that Martha was played by the absolutely beautiful Elizabeth Taylor, I know she gained 30 pounds but it doesn't even look like her, bravo! I feel bad for Richard Burton, he really deserved that Oscar, or hell, any of them. Everyone did an amazing job with acting and keeping me interested, the film is very deep and I still don't think I got everything. For awhile I was unaware of what was going on, for a minute I thought there was some elaborate con going on or it was a test to see how long the guests would stay, considering George talks about teaching a lot but it was nothing more than two bitter old people literally hating each other. I want to watch it again but the movie was such an unpleasant experience but for all the right reasons, I think I might need to wait. With all the shouting and foul language going on, I'm in no hurry to see it again but at the same time I want to go out and buy the DVD as soon as possible to experience it at least one more time.",

The energy and the vigor of the ensembles' performance was absolutely stupendous, yet exhausting but made the movie so thoroughly engaging that it was difficult not to get completely enthralled. And just when you think there can't possibly be anything else left unsaid, no more surprises left to be revealed; then, they throw just another little morsel of information just before the end of the film that just takes you for another loop and realize \"Holy cow!\"....the depth of this film is absolutely incredible and these seemingly simple characters are actually quite complex.

Her Oscar-winning performance as the psychologically tormented Martha is one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema. Taylor's imperceptible shifting from sadism to tenderness, from bullying condescension to exhausted vulnerability, is a masterclass in character building. Martha is a truly monstrous character, and yet Taylor is able to imbue her with sympathy, allowing you brief glimpses of the warm and lovable woman she could have been.\n\nRichard Burton is equally magnificent as George; an ageing, failing college professor whose initial meekness gives way to a raging torment all of his own. His verbal sparring with Taylor, like two pit-bulls in the ring of an endless and bloody dogfight, has become legendary. Every word drips with malice and contempt, every sentence is designed to cut the deepest wound. At times, it becomes painful to watch, but like true train-wreck television, you cannot drag yourself away from the inevitably terrible conclusion.\n\nQuite possibly, this is as close to perfect as movies can get; beautifully written dialogue, deeply complex characters, an evolving and suspenseful storyline, beautiful photography, and a wonderfully understated score by Alex North. Nominated for 13 Academy Awards in 1967, but lost out to A Man for All Seasons and Born Free to win only 5.\n\n\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" \"I am.\"",

But to make such characters compelling and sympathetic as well-a necessity if the audience is to care about the juvenile antics happening on screen-is much more challenging.  Ernest Lehman's screenplay and Mike Nichols' directing are not up to the task.  Burton and Taylor, unsurprisingly, are, and only their acting makes the film watchable.  In an early scene Taylor gets the chance to impersonate Bette Davis, which she does remarkably well.  Still, viewers seeking an intelligent film on the theme of domestic dysfunction would do better to watch Liz in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1958).",

Directed by Mike Nichols, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" introduces us to George and Martha, the world's most dsyfunctional nightmare of a couple. They are alcoholics who know exactly how to get on each other's nerves. When they invite junior professor Nick and his mousy wife Honey to their home for a drink, they set the young ones in between night-long emotional warfare, playing disturbing \"fun and games\" and exposing them to their violent nature. It all ends in a shocking revelation bathed in alcohol and cigarette smoke. The story is helped tremendously by the powerhouse performances of the cast. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor are a perfect George and Martha. Ironically, their marriage was in the same nature as the couple in the film. George Segal is a fine Nick, and Sandy Dennis is absolutely hilarious as Honey, who really gets going when she pounds down a few drinks. A mixture of dark comedy and intense domestic drama, this 1966 film still leaves a burn in cinema history today.",

They speak quietly, and in the last lines Martha answers the title question with \"I am, George, I am.\"\r\n\r\n3    The choice of Elizabeth Taylor-at the time regarded as one of the most beautiful women in the world-to play the frumpy, fifty-ish Martha surprised many, but the actress gained 30 pounds for the role and her performance (along with those of Burton, Segal and Dennis) was ultimately praised. \r\n\r\n\r\n4    The film was considered groundbreaking for having a level of profanity and sexual implication unheard of at that time. Jack Valenti, who had just become president of the MPAA in 1966, had abolished the old Production Code. In order for the film to be released with MPAA approval, Warner Bros. agreed to minor deletions of certain profanities and to have a special warning placed on all advertisements for the film, indicating adult content. Even the Catholic Office refused to \"condemn\" the film.\r\n\r\n[img]http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSK5CzmGBO2ILD5o5j9l27fToJScRV_SZbwyiQstYZ_rjQ_fL1W_A[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCast\r\n\r\nElizabeth Taylor as Martha\r\nRichard Burton as George\r\nGeorge Segal as Nick\r\nSandy Dennis as Honey\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected by\tMike Nichols\r\nProduced by\tErnest Lehman\r\nScreenplay by\tErnest Lehman\r\nStory by\tEdward Albee\r\n\r\nMusic by\tAlex North\r\nCinematography\tHaskell Wexler\r\nEditing by\tSam O'Steen\r\n\r\nDistributed by\tWarner Bros.\r\nRelease date(s)\t\r\n\r\nJune 22, 1966\r\nRunning time\t131 minutes\r\nCountry\tUnited States\r\nLanguage\tEnglish\r\nBudget\t$7.5 million\r\nBox office\t$40,000,000\r\n\r\n[img]http://cdn-3.nflximg.com/images/0290/1060290.jpg[/img]",

Now, many years removed from that first viewing, I am inclined to write-off my reaction to my unfamiliarity with cinema's canon. But I believe I would be wrong to do that. Surely, it is due, in part, to the original playwright, Edward Albee, but I think this movie captures its audience with the reality of it all. The characters seem real, and the dialogue does too. The events and the stories are all too familiar. The tragedy of life is laid out before us, and we cannot help but weep for it.",

Shocking, intense, vulgar yet hauntingly beautiful, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is an explosive game-of-wits thriller. \n\nThe film has only four actors, takes place in a very few locations and that too in a single night. In the entire film, George and Taylor inflict verbal abuse at each other yet there is not a single moment that lets you go off. Their arguments, their silly petty games, their outlook towards sex still makes movie fanatics wonder how the hell \"they\" could have done it so realistically. The film repels us with it's disgusting allegory yet attracts us with how perfectly it's filmed. Kudos to Nichols' direction, Lehman's screenplay, the score, the beautiful black-and-white cinematography, the editing...\n\nElizabeth Taylor, who was considered the most beautiful woman in the world that time, surprised many when she played the vulgar, frumpy, fifty year old Martha and had gained 13 kilos to play the role. She is the best in the entire ensemble and no doubt she won an Academy Award for her stunning performance. \n\nThis is undoubtedly one of the best Drama films I have ever seen. A Highly Recommended classic. A new addition to one of my all time favorites.\n\nVisit my facebook page: www.facebook.com/filmsthemostbeautifulart",

Yes, it was adapted originally from a play, which was also amazing and chilling, but mostly it's the superb performances, and the beautiful directing. The two main attractions in the film are George and Martha who are a married couple that drink a lot. And when i say a lot i literally mean it, throughout the movie the drinking gets worse and worse, and somehow the amounts become larger. Which is great because that's what makes the movie build up to it's intense and craziness! Martha is played by the superb Elizabeth Taylor, who shines and scares in this role how intensely she plays a drunk. She has so many great yelling, insulting, and mean things to her husband, George throughout the film. George is played by the professional and interesting Richard Burton, who ironically, in reality, was married to Elizabeth Taylor for a small portion of time. Let's hope they didn't behave like this. About 20 or 30 minutes into the film they invite a younger married couple over that are much more put together, that is until they get some alcohol in their system. There are many scenes in the film that get so intense and insane that at times it gets awkward and uncomfortable to watch. But that's the effect of the film, some may strongly dislike and others may love it like myself. Taylor is superb in her role as Martha, and this film shows why Taylor won and deserved so many of the oscars she won in the past and future, including the best actress award for this role. Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf? is definitely not a film for everyone but it is for sure done well.",

This is a powerful play on film, with some brilliant performances and each of the 4 main performers managing to hold their own against one another while on screen, it's power and controversial themes brought down the Hays Production Code, and ushered in New Hollywood. Set on the campus of a nameless New England college, it has the alcoholic Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) and her husband, history professor George (Richard Burton) coming home at 2am after a party. Martha then announces she's invited a young couple over for a few drinks, Nick (George Segal), who is a sports instructor and his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis). George is peeved that Martha has done this without consulting him first, but they come and despite trying to put on a good appearance, it's Martha's decent into drink and horrendous rants which George joins in with, and it's the alcohol and the presence of Nick and Honey, which George and Martha use to hurl abuse and pain towards one another about their failing marriage. It's heavy going stuff, but it's the brilliant dialogue and performances that help this move along, along with Nichols' tight direction, (he missed out on an Oscar for this, but he got one the following year for The Graduate (1967)), it's dark stuff and it shows what damage alcohol can really do to people. You don't get chamber pieces like this now, but Nichols did something similiar with Closer (2004), oh and Polanski's Carnage (2011).",

It's a pretty straightforward question, but one that is clearly open to interpretation. On the more extreme side of the scale we have an answer in the form of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? And I doubt you'll find a better acted, better scripted, or better executed film, not just about the question I just asked, but in general.\n\nThe plot is a marvelous understatement; \"A bitter aging couple (Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor) with the help of alcohol, use a young couple (George Segal and Sandy Dennis) to fuel anguish and emotional pain towards each other.\" (www.imdb.com) But to be honest, that's all there really is to say. Looking at the facts, this movie only has 4 characters, not including 1 bar owner and 1 bar maid with one line of dialogue between them, it takes place on no more than 3 sets, and is almost solely dialogue driven. \n\nThe starkness of this film makes for an unambiguous singularity of purpose. Richard Burton and Elizabeth are extraordinary in their roles as their constant, venom-laced, tongue-in-cheek dialogue is spat back and forth, much to the shock of their guests. It is worth noting that all four actors in this film were nominated for an Oscar, making it one of three films ever to have its entire cast nominated. Suspense seamlessly rises and falls courtesy of heated conversations and simplistic camera angels. \n\nRereading this, I don't feel I've done a good job selling this film, but I really don't know what else to say, except watch it. I will say that this movie is an emotional train wreck with no point, or metaphors. It's a film for film lovers primarily. I believe I am, and give this film what is feel is a deserved 5 stars. However this film can be viewed as bleak and hopeless just as easily and earn 2 stars. It rides a finer line than most films.\n\nThe simplicity of this film, complimented with its dialogue (yes I'm going to bring it up again) is shockingly compelling and delivers an emotional hit akin to a sledgehammer on a drawing pin. It shares an assassin's single minded since of purpose. It's brutally cold, cynical and calculated, and there's plenty to like about the way it does its thing.",

Therefore, so many films, so little time is the basis of my excuse (as of today there are 318 titles on my list to see). For now, I am taking aim at many films that have eluded me from the 1960's. Virginia Woolf was high on the 60's titles and now I understand why Mike Nichol's film is hailed as a masterpiece. About 20 minutes into it thought, how is this film going to run for over 2 hours? Well, about 30 minutes into it, all questions or earthly concerns died. My house could have caught fire and I would have went up in smoke staring at Elizabeth Taylor tormenting Richard Burton in her drunken rage. I immediately took notice of how well it was shot and focused on the careful angles and closes ups. This is 60's filmmaking at its very best! A Man For All Seasons has much to live up to now. \r\n\r\nElizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton stumble home from a party one night and are just about too drunk to stand. Once home and ready to call it a night, Burton is informed that Taylor has invited a young couple over for a nightcap. Although angry at the inconvenience, he straightens up a bit and prepares to entertain his guests (George Segal and Sandy Dennis). Once, the guests arrive, the tension boils over and bitter anger erupts almost immediately. Taylor reveals a never before seen viciousness that simply must be seen. Burton is electrifying as he meekly dismisses Taylor's verbal assaults but he soon shows how quickly he can rip someone to shreds with careful words of his own. Segal and Dennis soon play into the warfare taking as many hits as Burton or Taylor, however, this young couple may very well be a suitable match for the evening. \r\n\r\nHonestly, I have never seen this much liquor intake in one single film. I seriously cannot recall a film with more copious amounts of hard liquor consumption. By the end of the picture my throat felt vodka burnt and my breath tasted like an ashtray. The story is mean and unforgiving but at the same time flawless in execution, just like the cast. These actors go for the throat in every scene for the entire running time. Ernest Lehman must be praised for his Oscar nominated screenplay because without this element of genius, this film would have been a different story for the actors to carry. Taylor is brilliant in her delivery and is one of the cruelest characters I've ever seen. Bravo for one of the greatest female performances in motion picture history! Meanwhile, I have been very interested in Burton since I saw Equus, and now I know I must see more of his work. Here, he intelligently defends himself, yet also has a keen style for inflicting pain on others in his path. The supporting cast, Segal and Dennis, earn their status among two villainous roles. They add much flavor to the main course in this banquet of insanity. How did I miss, this for so long? I must say, it is just unlike anything else I've ever seen and can't classify it with any other body of work. Period. (A+)",

It's emotionally exhausting, brutal, cynical,and a real downer. Here's the thing, though: there are people like this who really exist in real life. It's painful, but honest.\n\nThe film garnered much controversy (as did the play) for the language and sexual content. It's rather tame by today's standards, but the viciousness of the verbal abuse and vitriol still stings. The insults and badgering in this movie are quite venomous at times, and I was somewhat unnerved by it all. Polanski's movie Carnage is comparable, but that one at least started off mildly pleasant before descending into savagery, whereas this one is uncivil from the start.\n\nThis really isn't a film I want to endure very often, if ever again. There is a point to it all, and while it is good to experience stuff like this from time to time, you'd have to be a little off to think this warrants frequent rewatches.\n\n\nBesides the unpleasantness, the film is overlong and somewhat repetitive, but what makes it all worth it are Haskell Wexler's excellent cinematography, and, most of all, the excellent performances from a cast where all four main players got Oscar nods, with two of them winning. That's easily the biggest redeeming factor here. This is a real master classic in acting, especially from Taylor and Burton. \n\nIt's overrated, grueling, and really joyless, but if you want to see excellent acting, and how dark relationships can get sometimes, then give this a watch.",

Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor could not have acted in a more apt time in their marriage - which too, like the couple in the film, was breaking apart. But nothing, not even the reputed notoriety of this classic, prepared me for the real thing. \"Damn You\"s and \"Screw You\"s are tossed all over the place like a baby howling tantrums. Plus of course the effective (and tense) Haskell Wexler cinematography and the poignant Alex North score, among others. It accurately depicts the break-up of a marriage built on ideals and crumbling in the face of reality. Edward Albee could not have had a better director to adapt his play than Mike Nichols. Nichols manages to keep us fixated in the film without any wavering of interest on our part. And the shocks that come abruptly from time to time - like for instance Burton's character suddenly preparing to \"shoot\" Taylor's character after she makes fun of him - are indeed quite jolting and entertaining. Mousy-faced Sandy Dennis and the seemingly quiet George Segal are also commendable as the newly wedded couple, both of whom in the end enliven their relationship out of the decaying disillusionment within the Burton-Taylor couple onscreen. Overall a 5 out of 5 stars.",

Unhappily married George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor) always bicker, and invite junior professor Nick (Segal) and his wife Honey (Dennis) to their house. Little do they know how much their hostes' fight and drink ... \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" is considered both Elizabeth Taylor's and Richard Burton's best film. It's very easy to see why. This was one of Mike Nichols' first movie, and was followed by the more popular \"The Graduate\". They're obviously very different, which proves his versatility. Though a married couple fighting seems like a bad idea, it's so much more than that. Taylor was only 34 when this was filmed and had to portray someone in their '50's. Burton was only in his '40's so it was the same for him. This movie goes down the same spiral every time-- a topic that sets George and Martha off, cringing, comic relief, and then silence. Though a weird mix, it's very noticeable, and besides being such a essential drama, I also think it is definitely the best black comedy as well. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is perfect because there's hardly any music, no thrills, no glitz, so the effect is so much more real. To make it better, the four actors are all absolutely mesmerizing. Dennis and Segal are the perfect married couple, and yes they most definitely deserved their Oscar prizes. Burton had already proved his point in this kind of genre, but this was a huge risk for the late Elizabeth Taylor. She had only proved herself as a dramatic actress, and though being good, she was always glamorous and made people think, \"Elizabeth Taylor is a vision\". This movie could have ruined her career, but instead marked a new point. She is ugly in this movie because of the makeup, and the way she portrays Martha is so painful yet wonderful that I was in awe every time she opened her mouth. Bravo. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is one of the best movies ever made, and those who say it's long and boring are obviously stupid.",

Elizabeth Taylor de-glams herself to play surly Martha who desperately clings to a secret fantasy, while real-life hubby Richard Burton is no less vicious as George. Mike Nichols attempts to distill the material from its Broadway roots via moments of experimental photography (courtesy Haskell Wexler) with mixed success.

Liz Taylor's Martha is now iconic and stands in severe contrast with most of the other roles she was known for, which in itself is a testimony to just how great and committed to acting she was. Martha is a viscious lush with a loud and nasty mouth fit to be muzzled if ever George had his way. Taylor won the Oscar, but Richard Burton's nuanced and sinisterly funny performance is a marvel. George is a stifled associate professor with adequacy problems, but it doesn't stop him from eventually winning his \"total war\" with Martha over the course of a drunken late night with two guests (more like hostages). Nick and Honey get dragged along for all the \"fun and games\" and even become victims themselves of Martha and George's seriously dysfunctional marraige.",

            "content": "In terms of acting and the cleverness of the writing, Virginia Woolf is easily 5 stars. In terms of enjoyment, I'd rate the film a little lower. So let's be diplomatic (something the characters in this movie would never be) and give it 3 and 1/2 stars. \n\nDon't get me wrong--Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, based on the play by Edward Albee, is a great film. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are riveting as a married couple who have learned how to perfectly torment and humiliate one another over the course of their many years together and take great sadistic and masochistic pleasure doing so--often fueled by endless glasses of liquor.\n\nThe plot is simple: Taylor and Burton (playing Martha and George) spend an evening \"entertaining\" a younger couple (the men are both university professors, and Taylor is the daughter of the university's president, so the evening is really more business than pleasure), which involves dragging the couple into the abyss of alcohol-fueled shrieking matches and crying jags that seem to be par for the course for Martha and George. By the end of the evening, infidelities have taken place, laws have been broken (drunk driving! drunk loitering! drunk everything!), and secrets have been revealed. While George and Martha seem to have gotten to a place of catharsis (again, they seem to indulge in these shenanigans on a regular basis), but we wonder if the young couple's marriage is not now completely infected by the unhappiness and degradation of the older couple's relationship.\n\nSounds fun, huh? It is for the first hour...quite funny, in fact. But by the time the final third rolled around, I wanted to plug my ears until it was over. Spending two hours with these characters is excruciating enough...I can't imagine being married to one. No wonder they drink.\n\nBut the worst part is that everyone involved is complicit in both their cruel actions and words, as well as their acceptance at what the other characters throw (literally and figuratively) at them. At any time, any of the characters could have stopped drinking and left--even just walked out of the house. No one does of course, because then there wouldn't be a movie. But they act like their problems are caused by the others in the room. In fact, each character creates his or her own misery.\n\nAnd the big question is: are George and Martha miserable? If so, why don't they get a divorce? Sure, Martha is the president of the university's daughter and thus George, a professor, has political and aspirational reasons to stay, but come on! There's a limit! The friends I watched this film with offered another explanation: George and Martha enjoy their screaming matches, their drunken fights, their intimate, castrating insults. Maybe not on a conscious level, but the two have been playing the game for so long, they can't imagine anything different. Couples play weird games all the time, but many confine them to the bedroom The difference is that George and Martha let their games of dominance, submission, humiliation, and one upmanship hang over their relationship at all times, like a black cloud waiting to burst. This makes for a riveting, haunting, but extremely unpleasant glimpse into the lives of two people who are thoroughly unhappy--and are quite content to stay that way.",

And she feels he only married her beuse he had hoped to one day run the college her father runs a tight reign on. Is she right? Did he ever really love her? Did he really murder his parents? And what is the secret surrounding their absent teenage son?\r\n\r\nThe answers slowly reveal themselves in a series of verbal games as a young couple drop by late in the evening to have a few drinks. After a party ends that was thrown in the young husbands honour by the professor's father-in-law, the new players quickly learn that smiles and friendly commentaries will not be enough for them to make through the evening with the seasones drinkers unscathed.\r\n\r\nThe young husband is handsome, cocky and ambitious. Hes a studly former athlete whose goal is to take the job the aging professor couldn't handle himself. The aging professor takes an immediate dislike to him. He embittered wife has other ideas. The young wife is naive and can't hold her liquor. Upon their arrival it is clear no one is going to become friends and soon everyone's dirty laundry is laid out in full view.\r\n\r\nThese four characters are made more intriguing by the sharp dialogue and witty bantering. Its like watching an angry ping-pong game. You can't take your eyes off it, but you wouldn't say its completely enjoyable either. I think its a timeless film. It must have been incredible to watch as a stage play. A definite personal favourite of mine. I love its rawness and its striking honesty to depict its cast with more than just one character flaw a piece.\r\n\r\nI watched this last night in honour of Elizabeth.

            "content": "Sadly, there are very few films that are capable of eliciting a visceral reaction out of me. However, Mike Nichol's 1966 debut film, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, is such a powerful film on so many levels that I cannot imagine anybody watching it without being significantly moved. The film is based on Edward Albee's Tony Award winning play and covers the events of one very long and alcohol induced night. It follows the plight of an aging couple George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor). When friends Nick (George Segal)  and Honey (Sandy Dennis) come over for a nightcap, they become caught in the middle of a series of games in which George and Martha take their pain and attempt to push each other to the breaking point. Albee's dialogue is explosive, both in terms of being emotionally charged and how it is projected, and is adeptly handled by the entire cast.. There is a brilliant mix of temperamental humor and anguish which includes one of my favorite lines, \"There isn't an abomination award going that you haven't won.\" \nWhile Albee's superb script provides a well-built chassis for the film, it is Nichol's direction mixed with Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography that makes this film really take off. Often times the camera will capture the scene as if it were merely a fly on the wall. However, Nichols really knows the material and will zoom in to the point of intrusion when a character feels emotionally isolated or verbally backed into a corner. In one particularly distinguished scene that deviates from the play, Nichols captures George walking into the back of the house when the Martha and the guests are still conversing in the living room. Even though George is out of ear shot of the others, Nichols keeps the audio of their conversation going while he follows George. This illuminates the extent of Martha's deviance as George can still knows that Martha will be speaking ill of him even when he is not in her company. Also, in the same vein as a noir, Nichols uses mirrors to show how these characters never take a good hard look at themselves and what they have become. One is even shoved in the face of George at one point, yet he is too steeped in his own misery to even see the man on the other side. \nThe performances here are simply astounding by all players involved. Although Taylor would nab the Oscar for best actress, I really feel as though Burton was snubbed. While his character could have just been watered down to nothing more than a dispensary of caustic wit, Burton injects a sense of humanity into the character that is present in the smallest of gestures.  \nHistorically, this film is bold as it was produced in some of the most impassioned years of the civil rights movement.  These years saw a mass movement to finally put an end to the anti-miscegenation laws that had previously prevented interracial marriages in America. This film shows that even white upper-middleclass marriages, which were seen as a bulwark against the decay of the human race, had their blemishes. \nIn the end, it is a beautiful film about a volatile relationship. It is about pain and the fiction that we manufacture in order to deal with it. The film isn't easy to watch, but if you do you will find that this is an absolutely astounding film.",

            "content": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a film that centers around two couples, both seemingly different at first glance. George (Richard Burton) and Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) are the older couple, having been married for years. He is a college history professor, and she is the daughter of the university president. Martha is also a raging alcoholic, and their relationship seems to be one from hell. Even from the very first scenes of the movie, we could see they they consistently taunt and verbally abuse one another, obviously fueled by Martha's massive booze intake. Nick (George Segal) and Honey (Sandy Dennis), on the other hand, are newlyweds, and are pretty much the most stereotypical newlyweds you can get. One night, Martha invites the two over for a night in. Add in a little (make that a LOT of) alcohol, and what we get is possibly the most interesting drunken night of insults in all of film.\r\n\r\nIf one is expecting this movie to be laden with physical violence, goofy humor, and/or eye-catching action scenes, they may be disappointed. These four characters are pretty much the only people we see for the next two hours, and the content of the film is almost all entirely composed of dialogue. This may initially turn many off, but, in my opinion, it's really some of the most interesting dialogue I have ever heard. The vast majority of the words passed are, of course, the insults directed between George and Martha. Although much of these remarks are hurtful, we find a surprising hilarity between it all. This was also one of the first films to aid in garnering in the MPAA rating system; it was rated R, mainly due to profanity and phrases such as \"screw you\", \"up yours\", \"great nipples\", and \"hump the hostess\".\r\n\r\nHowever, as entertaining as this may all seem on the forefront, it is a bit heartbreaking when digging deeper into the surface. Such rude remarks had passed among the couple through much loss of mutual respect. George can't stop taunting Martha, and Martha can't stop humiliating George. She even attempts to seduce Nick, in her efforts to spark up some jealousy in George. We soon wonder if love still even exists in their marriage. Eventually, we see Nick and Honey firing upon each other as well, as if such an environment was contagious towards their actions. The alcohol may be to blame, but throughout the night, we see them becoming less like the couple they were from the start, and more and more like George and Martha.\r\n\r\nThe acting undoubtedly played a major role in the overall profoundness of the film (all four actors were nominated for Oscars this year!), but the standout performance definitely comes from Elizabeth Taylor. Prior to this film, she was already a big-name actress and considered one of the most beautiful women in the world. Having to make her into the ugly, frumpy, middle-aged Martha was some leap of faith, but she makes it work, and I do believe this is her best piece of acting ever. She and Richard Burton were actually married in real life at this time, so the heated arguments George and Martha engaged in sparks the viewers' imaginations as to how their relationship actually was.\r\n\r\nOverall, this film is something that has to be seen to be believed. Not everyone could benefit from watching this movie, as the completely dominant usage of dialogue might seem slow for some, but this is definitely a must-see for any classic film lover. This is also my favorite Liz Taylor movie, and I'm just so glad that this wonderful, talented actress left us with this remarkable feat that shall be most treasured for the time coming. She will be missed so dearly.",

Throughout these two hours, the viewer is pelted with some of the most abrasive use of dialogue that hasn't been matched by any other film (not even \"Pulp Fiction\"), pure emotions, and every single thing under the sun. Except for nudity. Mike Nichols wasn't that crazy yet.\n\nGeorge (Richard Burton) and Martha (Liz Taylor) are a middle-aged couple who hold parties and play the image of a happy, successful, and passionate household in order for people not to investigate into their lives. One Saturday night (or really early Sunday morning), Martha invites a couple (Sandy Dennis; George Segal) over for some harmless fun and games. Unbeknownst to any of them, this would be a night that will change their lives forever. Thanks in part to some insanely frightening and sadistic party games (like \"Get the Guests,\" where you torture the guests by relaying sordid elements of their past), these couples are stripped bare of any adult qualities, now writhing around on the floor and crying like little children.\n\nWhat makes the film (and the play) so powerful is how wickedly humorous it can get while pulling the heartstrings. It's the antithesis of the romantic comedy - we're not looking at husbands who strive to be better than Alvy Singer. Instead, we're looking at the dissolution of the traditional family unit, from the parents all the way down to the children. The whole film is steeped in insanity and comedy, from scaring party guests with a fake shotgun to making snark about their private lives. To be honest, it's not just about couples and living life without illusions - it's also an allegory on the generation gap and how people don't really change (despite being younger and having different ideas on how things work). We get behavior vs. observation here. We get young vs. old. We get man vs. woman.\n\nThis play (or album or film or whatever) is a transition piece that shows how tough it was to change from one set of ideas to another during the turbulent '60s. It's a film that wants to document how life was behind these curtains of success and happiness - and what people did in order to make themselves feel happy. It's a film that brought about the era of modern filmmaking. It's also a film that showed us that profanity could be used not as an exploitation of sordid elements of our culture, but a way to liven things up - to make the party more exciting. In summary, it's a modernized Warner Bros. epic.",

I mean, a man can put up with only so much without he descends a rung or two on the old evolutionary ladder, which is up your line. Now, I will hold your hand when it's dark and you're afraid of the boogeyman and I will tote your gin bottles out after midnight so no one can see but I will not light your cigarette.

No, you mustn't. Martha is changing, and Martha is not changing for me, Martha hasn't changed for me in years. If Martha is changing, that means we're going to be here for days. You're being accorded an honor, and you mustn't forget that Martha is the daughter of our beloved boss. She is his right... arm. I was going to use another word, but we'll leave that sort of talk to Martha. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[George takes a corner far too fast, tossing everyone in the car from side to side.

You think he made his own wife sick? \r\nGeorge: Well, you make me sick. \r\nMartha: That's different. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMartha: Hey! \r\nGeorge: Hark!

I'm not. \r\nGeorge: You're a spoiled, self-indulgent, willful, dirty-minded, liquor-ridden... \r\nMartha: SNAP! It went SNAP! I'm not gonna try to get through to you any more. There was a second back there, yeah, there was a second, just a second when I could have gotten through to you, when maybe we could have cut through all this, this CRAP. But it's past, and I'm not gonna try. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMartha: I looked at you tonight and you weren't there... And I'm gonna howl it out, and I'm not gonna give a damn what I do and I'm gonna make the biggest god-damn explosion you've ever heard. \r\nGeorge: Try and I'll beat you at your own game. \r\nMartha: Is that a threat George, huh? \r\nGeorge: It's a threat, Martha. \r\nMartha: You're gonna get it, baby. \r\nGeorge: Be careful Martha.

Inspired casting of Hollywood's most notoriously explosive yet loving couple (Taylor married a lot of people, but she only married one of them twice!).\n\nThis was the first movie to have its entire cast nominated for Oscars, and the only one since with more than 2 credited actors. Taylor won deservedly, the role is universally agreed to be her best, and Dennis took home the statue as well, but inexplicably, Burton didn't. To date, this movie also remains the only Best Picture nominee that was nominated for every single eligible category, something that is highly unlikely to ever happen again.\n\nWhile the beginning still has you laughing at the abuse drunk and drunker George & Martha hurl at each other, the gibing, game-playing & provoking quickly turns from being amusing (\"And I'll bet your wife has the broadest, most inviting avenue of the whole damn campus.\") to downright vicious and cringe-worthy.

It has a completely incredible ensemble of actors that take their characters and made them into personal, believable flawed human beings disparaged by the perils marriage. Every single person in this is enigmatic but the crowning glory goes to Elizabeth Taylor who is Martha; a crude and slew wise cracking but ruthless woman. Richard Burton who is George as her supporting co-star deserves credit for his performance as well.  They just mold into their roles of an aging couple who thrive on childish games and bullying to get by in their warped sense of marriage; essentially a pitiful love-hate relationship that has been going on for 22 years. \n\nIt keeps you glued to the screen as a voyeur watching the tension rise and you start questioning the reasons why these people are so cruel to each other and what their motives and intentions really are. Also, the ending is so unexpected and a surprising twist. There is so much hostile emotion, it can be melodramatic (what great drama film isn't?), but fit in dark comedic parts into an already superb script and everything is impeccably balanced.  \n\nNetflix it, rent it, catch it on TV.

Making a film so simple with such limited sets and a small number of characters means the movie has to be attention-grabbing and stay that way.  This movie is strange in that because it is so caustic and bitter, it becomes horrifying and then dull in the sense that you soon get it:  this type of arguing happens all the time and there is no end in sight.  As a result, the movie is too long in some parts, with it simply being a series of arguments that are separated by brief lowkey moments.  The script is razor sharp and full of caustic wit; it's too bad the film wasn't trimmed down a little.  The audience can only take so much yelling and malice.  It's a very unflattering and sad portrait of a loveless marriage, and it's worth seeing if only for the writing, performanes and direction.  But I guarantee you won't be smiling afterward.",

By just watching the movie, you actually believed it so well from beginning to end that you didn't know what else to believe? This movie is one of those films. Its dark and psychologically haunting take on a married couple in college, Virginia Woolf just left me breathless.\r\n\r\nBased on the play by Edward Albee, this movie stars Edward Burton and Elizabeth Taylor as the Dean of a college and his drunkard wife. Throughout the movie, they're constantly fighting and bickering while she drinks and berates him. Later on, a newlywed couple of a college professor and his wife arrive, and Burton and Taylor really begin to go at it. Separately, though, they learn more about the new couple: secrets, history, etc. With the new knowledge, Burton and Taylor start \"playing games\" with each other while involving the new couple. There's a big moment where the fight eventually turns into a free-for-all, but Burton draws a wild card in the end and, although bittersweet and somewhat Pyrrhic, defeats Taylor.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Taylor, if Wikipedia serves accurate, was considered by many the last person anyone saw for the role; but she honestly put on an obvious effort to prove herself. The chemistry and anti-chemistry between the two mains is just perfect, and it grips you from beginning to end.\r\n\r\nThe scariest thing of all, psychologically, is that you don't know whether they really hate each other or are just simply playing games. Edward Albee wrote this play to say something, and it looks like he's describing marriage as a constant battle for superiority. Who has the most power over whom? Who really has the upper hand in everything, especially in a commitment? And how far do you go in such a battle before you realize you've gone too far?\r\n\r\nBottom line: this movie has amazing acting, a really good story buildup, and it leaves you with shivers both in mind and soul. It's one of those films that makes you afraid of living this life yourself.",

There is very little room to breath in this movie because Burton and Taylor are constantly at eachother's neck, and the film captures the intensity wonderfuly.\r\n\r\nThis isn't that much of a technical movie, the real brilliance and attention grabber was truely the acting.

I mean, she has never been bad but this picture clearly proved her to be a versatile character actress if needed.

The film itself garnered thirteen Oscar nominations and won five Academy Awards including Best Actress (Taylor), Best Supporting Actress (Sandy Dennis), Best B/W Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Art Direction.\r\n\r\nThe film is deserving of its Academy Awards.  It is well written and the performances are impressive, with the real-life husband and wife team of Taylor and Burton as the main standouts.  The biting and sharp dialogue characterized by name-calling, insults and accusations between the two main characters can be very sad and disheartening at times because of its cruel and condescending nature while at the same capturing the essence of their rocky 20-year marriage with unflinching honesty.\r\n\r\nThis is a black comedy where the humor is placed at just the right moments thereby giving audiences some comic relief from its grim subject - albeit, some nervous ones.  As Mike Nichols' directorial debut, he is to be commended for successfully adapting a stage play onto the big screen.  His choice of camera shots and angles is worth noting.  He is able to show who has the upper hand in the numerous no-holds-barred exchanges while capturing the intensity of the verbal arguments that ultimately leads to an exploding climax along with the behaviors and hateful thoughts of the different characters.  The film is an emotional roller coaster and a very intense one at that.  Nichols' impeccable pacing keeps the viewers guessing as to which character will finally \"lose it\" and end up actually physically hurting the other.\r\n\r\nIn the year this film was released, Fred Zinnemann's \"A Man For All Seasons\" will go on to win the Best Picture Oscar.  Maybe the content and language of \"Virginia Woolf\" was just too shocking for its time and the Academy as a whole.  But I would have preferred Nichols' film to Zinnemann's for the top prize.  Needless to say, Nichols would win the Best Director Oscar the next year for \"The Graduate\", which is also on AFI's Top 100 Films at #7.  He will also go on to direct \"Silkwood\", \"Biloxi Blues\", \"The Birdcage\", among others.\r\n\r\nFilms that have a well-written screenplay, compelling performances, beautiful cinematography, fine direction and technical artistry will always stand the test of time.  \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is one of those films.",

Many believe they modeled their performances on their real life relationship, and that this is the ultimate portrait of a crumpled marriage. Martha and George have a life built on the misconception that they can be happy based on political and social standards, but now, in their middle age, both feel the weight of their inactions and prejudices. They invite over a married couple (Sandy Dennis and George Segal) and spend the entire night fighting and degrading themselves and their guests. The play is about faith in love, and the decay of a relationship that needed to end years ago. Mike Nichols seems impervious to failure, and with this, his first venture, he has secured legions of fans who want to see the drama of interpersonal relationships displayed onscreen again and again.",

Have you ever sat through \"Butterfield 8\"? She won an Oscar for that one and it's terrible. She must have slept with someone. \"A Place Under the Sun\"? I get sleepy just typing the title. If I have Turner Classic Movies on and I don't know what's coming next and that guy says \"..next, Elizabeth Taylor stars in this touching '50s drama...\" I know it's going to suck. \r\n\r\nShe was a good actress though, she's excellent in this movie, but Marylyn Monroe had more good movies under her belt than her. That's a shame because Elizabeth Taylor was twice the actress she was. \r\n\r\nThis movie is a darkly humourous exploration of.. um.. well.. love, I guess. Have you ever hung around that couple that fights constantly, right at the dinner table, in front of everyone, but they stay together no matter what? You quit hanging around them because it's too embarrasing. Years later, you're amicably divorced yet you still see that couple together in the supermarket? They're still fighting, right in the middle of the store, apparently they haven't killed each other yet and they're still together. Yeah, well, that's what this movie is about. That couple and whatever weird glue holds them together. It's funny as hell, but tragic too. This movie serves bitter laughs. It gets a little arty at the end, silly if you ask me, but I love it. Maybe I'm just a little arty and silly myself and I want to figure out that couple's secret.",

George is a miserably unhappy history professor and Martha is his verbally abusive and corrosive wife. They invite over the newest professor Nick and his plain-looking wife for drinks. Things start volatile and just escalate in a night of painful self-reflection and cruel revelations. Fueled by a large amount of liquor George and Martha begin a very explosive battle of wits, hurling insults and threats at each other and their guests who are unfortunately stuck in the middle of this unexpected war. Here is a couple (George and Martha) who have been married for so long they cannot seem to remember what they liked or loved about each other to begin with. This is a couple so firmly rooted in their absolute hatred of each other that happiness is but a distant memory.\r\n\r\nTaylor and Burton are brilliant in their roles. She is just viscous and he is absolutely despicable. Years of nagging have made George into a bitter old man only content with spreading his misery around and poor Nick and Honey are that night's targets. \r\n\r\nAs the night goes on couple Nick and Honey's relationship is tested and begins to almost mirror that of George and Martha's, revealing the flaws and resentments of their own marriage.\r\n\r\nNichol's debut film is fantastic! The dialogue is smart and is sharply delivered by silver tongues of the two leads. There are plenty of awkward, uncomfortable moments, but, like watching a car crash, one cannot help but watch and be drawn in.",

This is a film about unhappy people whose only solace is their own fantasy world, a world which one party maliciously destroys in order to wound the other one the deepest.  With only four characters and two main settings, the focus is on dialogue and the interactions of the characters.  And these four actors do not disappoint.  Burton gives a more restrained performance as the exasperated husband who quietly and subtly cuts down his wife, only raising his voice when absolutely necessary.  Liz is more brazen as his wife, screaming and tearing into him with insults that would still sting today.  She is nonetheless just as incredible in her performance; even in black and white you can see every angry flash in her eyes.  Sandy Dennis was a revelation as Honey; when I first saw her on screen I thought \"Bambi\" because she looked like a deer in headlights.  And when she opened her mouth I saw that she acted like one too, a child not quite grasping the horror of what's happening around her.  Segal seems to be the forgotten one here, seemingly the weakest of the four, but the fact that he held his own in one on one scenes with the thunderous presence that was Burton shows his true depth. This is not a movie you can watch often--unless for some reason you enjoy watching people verbally knife each other in the heart--but there can be no denying that the first time you see it will be unforgettable.",

Virginia Woolf is possibly one of the most well-acted films ever made. Richard Burton and George Segal are outstanding, but the real powerhouse performance comes from Elizabeth Taylor, who is hypnotic for every minute.

But the performance that really does not demand criticism of any kind is Richard Burton's uncanny performance as George, but I really couldn't say it was a performance, because he inhibited the heart and soul of the character, rather than just playing it. George Segal and Sandy Dennis also gave brilliant performances as the questioning, devastated young couple in the middle of the emotional war between the two bitter, older couple. There were plenty of interpretations regarding the aging couple's child and its effect to them, some wouldn't even care to give meaning to its ambiguity, but I would say that the (SPOILERS!) killing of the imaginary child was the spark to bring them both to reality, as reflected to their rather tender, honest exchange in the end, in contrast to their endless verbal skirmishes that covered the duration of the film. Is there really an adequate explanation to all of the psychological dilemmas that the film has brought forth? None maybe, but the film, as a whole, also shows the maddening effect of a loveless, bitter marriage.",

            "content": "This film, the first film directed by the brilliant Mike Nichols, changed film as we know it today.  It broke down the barriers of how people spoke in movies and movies were never the same after this.\r\nThe film has 4 characters-George (Richard Burton), associate history professor.  Martha (Elizabeth Taylor) George's loudmouthed wife and daughter of the head of the college. Nick (George Segal) New member of the biology department. And Honey (Sndy Dennis) Nick's young bride. That's it.  The plot-Nick and Honey come over to George and Martha's home after a faculty function for night-caps.  That's it.\r\nHowever what happens is two hours of talk, drinks, secrets, and games.  George and Martha love having people over for drinks and games (Hump the Hostess, Get The Guests, etc.) They love torturing and abusing one another with words and Nick and Honey very quickly realize that instead of coming over for drinks, they've actually entered Hell, in the form of a living room. Secrets are revealed and the more liquor they drink the more vicious the games become.  This is a landmark film and anyone interested in film history needs to see this film.\r\nElizabeth Taylor won a much deserved Oscar as the overweight and drunken Martha and Sandy Dennis won for her sad disturbed portrait of Honey.  The film captured 6 Oscars in all failing to win Best Picture, which is completely deserved.  The Academy chose the more safe \"A Man For All Seasons,\" a good film but nothing like the masterpiece this film is. The film was released by Warner Bros and is not rated.",

For Taylor, I would go so far as to say this was her greatest performance ever. The chemistry between Richard Burton and Taylor was excellent. I almost thought they would try to kill each other on screen a few times. The story was very good and the screenplay did not deviate from Edward Albee's play. Mike Nichols did an excellent job as the director, especially since this was his film debut. Pacing was solid and this definitely was one of the best films from the 1960s.",

Although I kinda wish I was in a more attentive mood.\r\n\r\nI got really into it at the beginning, then got lost somewhere after the \"bourgin\" scene in the yard, and had a hard time getting back into it. Im definitely gonna need to give this one a second viewing at some point and/or tear into the actual play.\r\n\r\nUgh, this is an awkwardly written blog entry. Sorry folks, not sure what's up with me today.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I loved how \\m/ up this one was (big surprise there). I really had not expected that. The first half made me feel uncomfortable silently observing the awkwardness. Then there were just so many WTF moments throughout.\r\n\r\nI dont feel I got really good understanding of the whole thing, though. I found a spark notes type site online and kinda skimmed it for info. Mostly because the wedding bouquet line caught me as familiar and I was trying to Google where I'd heard it before.\r\n\r\nFantastic cast. I dont think I'd ever seen Liz Taylor in action before, so watching her in the role she considers her best was really cool. Was also thinking that I'd love to play Honey someday. Lately when I see plays (or movies from plays) I'd been thinking about them from a directorial perspective. It'd been a while since I came away from one thinking about it as an actor, but yeah I think I gotta add that to the list of dream roles. Not that Im likely to have a shot at it, and I really dont know how well I'd do, but it'd def be a fun challenge.\r\n\r\nRight, well Im really not making much sense today. Gonna stop for now, hit the grocery store, and re-evaluate if I really should hit another AFI before Flogging Molly tonight or not.\r\n\r\nhttp://expletivedleted.livejournal.com\r\nhttp://www.twitter.com/expletivedleted",

            "content": "Real life (at the time) couple Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor star in this cynical send-up of not just marriage, but the human race in general.  Burton plays George, an aging history professor who's married to the daughter of the university president, Martha.  George, at first glance, appears to be a henpecked and harried husband, whereas Martha is loud and \"braying\" as he describes her.  They both seem to be (somewhat) functioning alcholics, and they both seem to loathe one another on some deeply fundamental level.  It's not only that they loathe one another, they can't even be bothered to pretend at the pleasantries of marriage anymore.  The film begins as George and Martha arrive home (at approximately 2am) drunk from a party and begin to bicker.  Martha then tells George she's invited the new professor and his wife over for drinks and they should be there at any moment.  When the young couple arrives, it's clear to George exactly what the new professor's motivations are, especially when he begins to butter up Martha.  From then on, it's an escalating war of words and painful diatribes as everyone's weaknesses are brought to the fore.  It's not the twist at the end that's so shocking when compared to the other twist that it's really George and Martha who truly love one another, and the young couple whose marriage seems more out of convenience than genuine affection.  The viciously well-written play by Edward Albee is excellently adapted to the big screen by Mike Nichols (\"The Graduate\").  Taylor and Burton seem to delight in ripping into each other, and even when the second half begins to meander along (including the unsatisfying and bizarre ending), it doesn't really dull the blistering impact of the first.  Modern sensibilities might be more shocked by the venom than the taboo subject matter, which I'm sure was ground-breaking at the time.",
