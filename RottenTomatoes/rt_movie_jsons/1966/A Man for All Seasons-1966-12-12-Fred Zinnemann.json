    "summary": "When the highly respected British statesman Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield) refuses to pressure the Pope into annulling the marriage of King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw) and his Spanish-born wife, More's clashes with the monarch increase in intensity. A devout Catholic, More stands by his religious principles and moves to leave the royal court. Unfortunately, the King and his loyalists aren't appeased by this, and press forward with grave charges of treason, further testing More's resolve.",

            "content": "Wow, this film doesn't miss a single step. Every scene is interesting, filled with colorful characters, well-written dialogue and compelling plot points. Scofield's More is almost impossible to read, which just makes him more compelling in my opinion. Robert Shaw is kind of terrifying as Henry VIII, switching between joviality and wrath in the blink of an eye. John Hurt and Leo McKern are a great, power hungry duo. \n\nThomas More suffers persecution at the hands of a monarch who simply will not be gainsaid and goes to the block with his conscience and his principles intact. It's an interesting question, especially as a Christian myself, if I would stand and die on the same hill as More. He's essentially unwilling to countenance divorce, and given the poor reasoning for Henry VIII's divorce, I think I'd have to agree with More on the merits of the argument. Whether I'd be willing to die for it, I'm not so sure.",

            "content": "Classic period drama thanks to some brilliant acting and directing.  The cast is superb across the board, with Paul Scofield genius as Sir Thomas Moore, a pious man trying to be both a servant to his king and God, especially when they conflict when one another.  He is shown to be adept at navigating the legal trials while maintaining his soul.  It helps he gets fantastic support from the rest of the cast, particularly Robert Shaw as King Henry VIII, his jovial charisma makes you like him even as he turns into a tyrant.  Behind the camera, Fred Zinnemann expertly adapts the book, with a brilliant mix of set pieces and dialogue.  Yes, it is a lot of talking but it is shot so well, along with being so good, it remains a cinematic experience.  Simply put, the kind of epic period dramas they just don't make anymore.",

            "content": "(a \"nonhistory and nonintellectual\" film review by Timothy J. Verret)\n\nLet me just start off by saying I do NOT like history and I am NOT an intellectual. I don't know what it is about history that makes me just want to snore. I'm intelligent, for the most part, but sometimes intellectualism can feel very inauthentic to me and take away from what I like to call \"heart work.\" I like to approach what I create from a place of deeper human and spiritual truths, a place where it's not mind over matter but rather heart over matter, and a place where if history is to repeat itself, it is to repeat itself for the present….for the now. This is where I plan to go with this \"nonhistory and nonintellectual\" film review of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (1966).\n\nA MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, a film based off of Robert Bolt's play of the same name, received the Academy Award for Best Picture and also won numerous other awards including Paul Scofield for Best Actor and, given this was a period piece, multiple Oscar wins in the costume and art direction categories. The biographical film details the life of Sir Thomas More, the 16th-century Lord Chancellor of England, at a time when he refused to sign a letter to annul Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine. This also led to More's refusal to take an oath of supremacy to declare Henry VIII Supreme Head of the Church of England. Why did More refuse to do these things? Simple. More was a man of conviction, a man of the Bible, and a man who stood by what aligned with this conviction and the Bible. He would not sway one inch if anything he said or did contradicted the Bible, not one inch if Savior Jesus Christ wouldn't say or do the same thing, and not one inch to rest on his laurels, for More had no laurels unless they were aligned with God and Jesus. More saw good and decency in all and never expressed an unkind word. When he did express words, boy did he ever express them with conviction! But these words were never more than were necessary and maybe that is how More lived up to his name, i.e., More never spoke \"more\" words than what were just enough. But words aside, it was More's \"silence\" that led to his beheading. I could go on and on about how \"silence\" is played out (and played, for the most part, quietly) in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, but I cannot be silent about this film being incredibly scrumptious in look while at the same time rich in emotions. It's a marvel of cinema as we watch the man More never marvel himself in any and all seasons. Ironically, this man More is exactly the man we need right now in the season we are in. This is where history can repeat itself. We can bring a kind man of conviction from history into the present, and Sir Thomas More is exactly the kind of man we need to bring into the present….the now!\n\nI got introduced to British actor Paul Scofield when I saw him in a theatre production of Edward Albee's A DELICATE BALANCE. In this film adaptation of the play, Scofield as Tobias was a force to be reckoned with. Going toe to toe with actress Katherine Hepburn on screen is not an easy feat for any actor, but Scofield did go toe to toe with Hepburn (in fact, stepped on her toes more than once). Scofield commands your attention when he is on screen. It was only after much research that I discovered Paul Scofield was quite famous in England for his roles in Shakespearean plays. No surprise here, as those trained in the theatre and especially trained in Shakespeare practically break the film camera with their intensity. It might be because they have to be \"big\" on stage that this same \"bigness\" leaves the film camera helpless to contain their energy. I recently saw Paul Scofield again in Arthur Miller's THE CRUCIBLE, another play turned into a film, and Scofield stole every scene he was in. There are some actors who when they act, the rest of the cast, not to discredit their talents, become \"furniture.\" Scofield is an actor who when he is on screen (I would have killed to see him onstage), he commands your attention and you feel downright guilty if you want to look at the other actors or dare turn away from Scofield. All this to say that Paul Scofield's performance as Sir Thomas More in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS is captivating, commanding, and convincing. He embodies More with a calm control, and what I noticed in Scofield's characterization is that when anyone addresses him in the film, he does a full 180-degree turn to face them. Because Scofield adds this demonstrative touch to More, all the characters in this film who call on him get his demonstrative attention. It's kind of like that someone who makes you feel you are the most important person on the planet when you are in their presence. This touch and attention is what Scofield brought to Sir Thomas More in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS.\n\nThe rest of the cast of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS, the direction, the music, all of it is sheer brilliance. And just to tell you how brilliant this film is, another Edward Albee play turned into a film, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, was nominated for Best Picture the same year as A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS and Richard Burton as George in the same Best Actor category as Paul Scofield. WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? is #6 on my all-time favorite film list. I shudder to think if I would have been on the Oscar Voting Committee that year. A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS and WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? where one is the Best Picture winner? I would have been, \"Sorry, dudes. I'm playing the ‘More card.' I will remain silent and not sign any oath to choose one of these films over the other!\" And don't get me started on having to choose the Best Actor of 1966: Richard Burton in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? or Paul Scofield in A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS? But if I'm being honest, I would have chosen Paul Scofield. Scofield is THAT amazing! As a side note, maybe that's why the Oscars changed the announcement of wins from \"and the winner is….\" to \"and the Oscar goes to….\" It really is so ego-driven to choose one film over another or one performance over another; they are ALL winners!\n\nWell, that's my \"nonhistory and nonintellectual\" film review of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS. If I got you to want to watch the film for history's sake, I failed. If I got you to want to watch the film for intellectual's sake, I failed, But if I got you to want to watch A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS because of Sir Thomas More's moral and Biblical conviction in the face of adversaries and adversity, something and someone so needed now, or if I got you to want to watch the film because of Paul Scofield's not-to-be-missed Oscar-winning performance as Sir Thomas More, then I have garnered a success in writing this film review!",

This films deals with how he treated religious figures and even betrayed ppl in his own court in the end. How he treated Thomas More was deplorable. I would have appreciated the film to have more going on than just talking and trials, but it stuck to its principles like Thomas. It showed how important fair trials are and our justice system today compared to the days of kings. I still see similiarities btw the bad guys then and bad guys now-being bullies/using intimidation, the one who is kinda good/but still bad, the layperson just \"carrying out their job\" and the  practice of following/recording ppl like in some societies today. The main message of staying true to ur own convictions against all else including death, is timeless.",

As a result, More resigns as Lord Chancellor, is tried for treason, and is beheaded. Writer Robert Bolt, who also penned the play, used the title from a quote from More's advisor Robert Whittington to describe him. Whittington said that while he barely knew the man, he said he was serious, witty and moral all at once. How does Fred Zinnemann show Whittington's thoughts on More in the movie? First, the intelligence comes from More's knowledge and passion for Catholicism and the laws of the day. Secondly, His humour sprays as sharp and dry, like when he insults Cromwell, comparing him to a \"dockside bully\" or complimenting on Alice's custards during his last meal. Lastly, More's moral instinct serves as less a human trait than a medal given to him. Thus, by giving up his medal of morality, he legally gives up his life to the good hands of the church. A Man for All Seasons writes to reflect on a progressive downfall of a 16th Century historical religious figure and a study on human behavior. \n\n(4 Gargoyle Statues out of 5)",

Paul Scofield is excellent in the role as Sir Thomas with his honesty, warmth as he sticks to what he believes and he is very good at speeches. Robert Shaw as the kings is sometimes a little crazy with his laughing at most things and his extravagance but impresses in communication with Scofield. It contains a sold supporting cast and the script may confuse some especially in the trial. The costumes and locations of the movie are deserve praise including many scenes down the river. Nothing seemed out of place or time. A film about your morals and conscience may bore people and some scenes were less interesting than others. The trial was a great scene with the camera panning down the crowd if they react and Leo McKern as an angry Thomas Cromwell with the crowd acknowledging elements of Sir Thomas but still disappointing that he doesn't back the king. The second half of the film is more interesting than the first as we see the struggle Sir Thomas has and how it will effect his family and friends. We also see how many characters have no morals as they strive to improve their situations walking over anyone they can. A decent movie with a great lead performances only let down by a slower first half than a more interesting second.",

            "content": "Fred Zinnemann's A Man for All Seasons, despite being directed by an Austrian-born American more famous for such films as High Noon and From Here to Eternity, is quintessentially British. Adapted for the screen by Robert Bolt from his play of the same name, it's a biographical period drama focusing on the life and death of sixteenth century Lord Chancellor of England Sir Thomas More, and although that doesn't sound particularly gripping the result is thoroughly absorbing.\nThe story basically concerns More's refusal to swear an oath to the effect that Henry VIII's marriage to Catherine of Aragon was unlawful, an oath demanded by the King so that he could marry Anne Boelyn instead. More refuses on the grounds of conscience and eventually gets sentenced to execution for high treason. This basically true story arises out of the minutiae of sixteenth century English politics and religion, and on paper it sounds as dull as ditchwater. It works for two main reasons, one of which is the Bolt's screenplay, the other of which is the acting.\nA Man for All Seasons shows its theatrical roots: Bolt's script is positively Shakespearean and is eminently quotable (\"I trust I make myself obscure?\" is just one of many wonderful lines). The script mostly consists of men debating points of principle and law. The dialogue is a gift for the actors: the cast is crammed with the best of British talent from the era (plus Orson Welles), most of them with classical theatre training. The producers reportedly wanted a higher profile actor than Paul Scofield to play More, but Zinnemann insisted that Scofield be allowed to reprise his stage role for the screen and it's now unthinkable to imagine anybody else in the part. He brings dignity and gravitas to More and every moment of his performance is captivating.\nHe isn't the only one: Leo McKern is wonderfully devious as the scheming and increasingly angry Thomas Cromwell, as is Nigel Davenport as More's friend Norfolk who is ultimately powerless to avert More's fate. Robert Shaw almost steals the show during his few short scenes as Henry VIII, capturing the man's mixture of charisma, arrogance, petulance, and short-temper perfectly. Wendy Hiller's Alice More makes a fitting foil for her husband, often countering his passionate moral stance with simple common sense, and the actress makes her love for her husband utterly believable. John Hurt is also convincing in an early film role as turncoat Richard Rich.\nRealising that his actors are the film's strength, Zinneman allows them to deliver performances that wouldn't be out of place in a theatre production, but which are perfectly suited to the script. He doesn't however deliver a film that looks as though it were filmed on a stage set, instead crafting an impressively mounted period peace with impeccable detail paid to the sets, costumes and props, and bolstered by some gorgeous location filming. The final shot of the executioner's axe descending towards More's neck before the film fades to black and a terse voice-over reveals the grim fates of most the film's other main characters provides a dramatic final punch. The mise-en-scène creates an illusion of sixteenth century England that is totally convincing, as does Georges Delerue's classical soundtrack.\nA Man for All Seasons is a great film. If it seems surprising that a British-made period drama won the 1966 Academy Award for Best Film, it shouldn't be: this is a master class in script-writing and screen acting and – in Zinnemann's handling of his material, cast and crew – directing.",

Beyond my issues with the ideas that the film supports I would also call it a tremendous bore that features uneven performances and cheap set dressing. Getting youths to sit down and watch this today would be incredibly difficult and I think that even adults would be nodding off as Paul Scofield delivers a self righteous monologue.\n\nThomas More, Paul Scofield, is the Lord Chancellor of England during the reign of King Henry VIII, Robert Shaw, but his refusal to accept the King's divorce from Catherine of Aragon causes him to face persecution. He remains strong in his convictions even as pressure piles on from those around him including his wife Alice, Wendy Miller, and fickle son in law William Roper, Corin Redgrave. His humiliated former protégé Richard Rich, John Hurt, sides with his enemies as the King desperately tries to pressure More into attending his wedding. More is eventually executed despite having no corroborated charges laid against him and re-states his allegiance to God over the King as he dies.\n\nThroughout More was a completely unsympathetic lead character as he makes idiotic decisions that threaten his life and that of those close to him based upon ideas that can't be proven. He speaks dismissively to those who care about him and sees his own ideals as being more important than the very real problems of those around him. His treatment of Rich and his son in law is seen as just because he is seen as always being right by the film as it seems to tell us that you must adopt one view and keep it forever or you are a person with no integrity. In my opinion people should make practical decisions in times of great upheaval and accept that those we care about are allowed to explore several different points of view before settling on one.\n\nThe performances left me cold as the two actors who gave subtle performances, Scofield and Hurt, played thoroughly dislikable and dull characters and the characters who should have lit up the screen were played by actors who still thought they were on the stage. I am shocked and horrified by the fact that Robert Shaw received an Academy Award nomination for his abominable performance as King Henry VIII. In a time period in which Henry Fonda and James Mason were giving subtle, layered performances in prestige films like this it was a slap in the face to see a bad theatre performance on the big screen and all of Shaw's actions and delivery of his lines seemed hammy and over the top especially when contrasted with Scofield. I would have given Best Actor to Michael Caine for Alfie (1966) because the year's nominees were not particularly strong and he is likable and charming giving a career-defining performance.\n\nThe film's pacing was odd as when you have a character with no development and he's opposing a historical figure famed for murdering people at the drop of a hat it's hard to build any real tension. I knew that he was going to die from the moment he opposed the King's decision and I was only annoyed by his antics in the lead up to his beheading, I was almost glad that it occurred because it shut him up for once. Even Braveheart (1995) managed to pull off a better death scene than this film and that's saying something.\n\nThe 1966 Best Picture nominees are pretty weak as only Alfie really appeals to me because I don't like Elizabeth Taylor's performance in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). This is definitely not Best Picture material despite a brief Vanessa Redgrave cameo and even it's light competition are definitely more engaging than it is. Watch The Apartment (1960), The Sound of Music (1965) or Oliver! (1968), I have not seen Lawrence of Arabia (1962) or Midnight Cowboy (1969) yet, if you want to see a good Best Picture winner from the 1960s.",

For a movie that is largely made up of verbal debates, I found it riveting. The number of different government and church officials that confront and chastise Thomas More is daunting, but a one-man-vs.-the-multitude story is always exciting. You naturally get on the side of the underdog, and it helps that he seems to be the only one taking the moral high ground. Paul Scofield does an amazing job of portraying Thomas More as a strong character, who is gradually beaten down by his trials. He gets a number of powerful speeches to deliver, and he does it so well that I can’t imagine anyone doubting the truth of his statements, and he proves his Oscar for Best Actor was well deserved. I’m not a big history buff, so much of this was new territory to me. I knew select details, but it was like seeing a whole new story unfold. I thought it was awesome when it became a legal battle, because I like any kind of court trial in film. It was even more interesting since Thomas More knew the ins-and-outs of the system so he could live in the loopholes to outsmart his detractors. I had a few moments where I struggled to follow what was happening in certain conversations, but I never felt like the movie was dragging. It seemed that every scene had a reason to exist, and even mundane tasks like More hiring a boat to take him home had relevance. This is the kind of film that dramatizes a historical event so well that I walk away with a desire to read more about the actual history. Not only did I love A Man for All Seasons, it’s the kind of film I expect could become a favorite when I watch it again someday.",

More is eventually made Lord Chancellor, one of the highest positions in government.  He resigns this position out of protest against the King's plans to go ahead with the divorce.  Surely, now that he is out of government and out of the limelight, as long as he doesn't air his views, his principles aren't a threat to the King's plans and he is safe from prosecution?\n\nDirected by Fred Zinneman (High Noon, From Here to Eternity, The Search) a wonderfully lavish production.

Like Ben Kingsley as Ghandi, the role of Thomas More would define Paul Scofield, who won the Best Actor Oscar over Richard Burton in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" Scofield had internalized the role, but Burton lived his, and acted circles around Scofield. But Hollywood prefers to honor heroes and martyrs over deeply flawed individuals. Oscar's snubbing of director Mike Nichols and Richard Burton showed that Hollywood could not handle the Truth. Robert Bolt's screenplay may stand as a flawless morality play, but it's still Golden Age Hollywood, with real emotions buried under Victorian manners and layers of costuming.

It won the academy award for Best Picture of 1966, and it co- stars famous actors Orson Welles, Robert Shaw, and John Hurt. The strongest aspects of this film are the writing and performances; combined, these two elements form a great movie.\n\nNot mentioned above, Paul Scofield, who I have never heard of prior to seeing this film, carries this film with a brilliant performance. He plays Thomas More, a man defiant to man's law if God's law says differently. This is the essence of his personality, and he is a character who is full of wisdom and a great sense of logic in order to defend himself against the accusations of the corrupt. While his wisdom and logic do not ultimately save him, these characteristics form one of the most inspirational characters I have ever seen on film. Scofield plays More as a man who calmly accepts his fate while standing by his words and beliefs, rather than pleading his allegiance to the corruption within England's government.\n\nThe supporting cast - especially John Hurt - do a good job of building up More even more (pun not intended) by portraying corrupt individuals who More has tried to help. More always has the best intentions; John Hurt's character is looking for employment at the beginning of the film, and More tries to convince him to become a teacher to avoid the corruption of government, and offers him a bribe he has received in order to get the man started. At first it seems possible that Hurt's character will remain loyal to More, but instead uses the fact that he was \"bribed\" by More to obtain a post within the government. It is heartbreaking to listen to Hurt's character lie about More late in the film in order to just keep climbing up the ladder, a situation More was trying to prevent entirely for the best intentions.\n\nMost of the film consists of inspiring monologues through More, an aspect I love since I think monologues are difficult to pull off correctly and are extremely effective in developing character. Scofield does it with mastery. I think it makes sense that this work stems from a play because I see it more fitting to be performed on stage than I see it as a cinematic work. If the film was more cinematic I would give it a perfect rating, but to me the only really visually captivating scene in the film was the penultimate scene: the trial for More's life. As my uncle says, in a way, this film makes you \"want to be a better person.\"",

            "content": "This sounds like some kind of a cheesy commercial trying to sell a man for any occasion, though probably mostly for labor. Ladies, if that grass has to be cut in the spring, or if you need leaves cleaned out of the gutter in fall, or if you need the Christmas tree put up in winter, or if you simply want to be served a cold drink on a hot summer day, then you need a man for all seasons! Man, speaking of diverse men, Fred Zinnemann has done noirs, westerns as big as \"High Noon\", war films as intimate as \"From Here to Eternity\", and even \"Oklahoma!\", but now he takes on his greatest challenge: portraying devout Catholicism, even though he's such a Jew that he moved from Austria to Hollywood. I think I'm more baffled by how British he, as an Austro-American, made this film, because the only American he has in this film is Orson Welles, the most British man in Hollywood. Welles was so awesome that I think that they should have given him a spin-off, like \"A Cardinal for All Seasons\", or, better yet, \"A Cardinal's Story\". Zinnemann would have be involved in that film, because the filmmakers would be sued hard enough by the guys who made \"The Cardinal\" without the obvious consent of the dude who made \"A Nun's Story\". If it was to be as long as either \"The Cardinal\" or \"A Nun's Story\", then I would hope that it would be more exciting than this film, which is reasonably engaging, but not especially momentous, and definitely not all that original.\r\n\r\nThe film is widely recognized for its freshness and impact on storytelling sensibilities in period dramas of its type, so, of course, what unique attributes there are prove to be notable and important, but they're limited, because in a lot of ways, this is a rather formulaic period drama which draws familiar characters and plotting tropes which come with their traditional shortage in subtlety. Among the impacting attributes of this film is its not being all that melodramatic, so much so that its story takes from a true tale, although this tale is set in a romantic, and had to be interpreted into a play before it was made into this '60s drama, so there are certain theatrics in histrionics and somewhat stereotypical characterization which are hard to buy into, even in the context of this romantic period piece which stands to flesh out its depths to a more compelling extent. I've already noted that there are some histrionic tropes to the characterization of this weighty, but formal character piece, but the expository shortcomings go deeper than that in this well-acted and generally well-drawn melodrama which is short on the background development of each one of its many major roles, and stands to be more nuanced after a while. The film doesn't take as much time as it probably should to flesh out the depths of its characters and their distinguished roles in this narrative, although it does dedicate a good amount of time to excess in order to reach a runtime of two hours, or at least seems to, as it runs into a lot of minimalist material which gets to be repetitious, and perhaps would have been more aimless if it wasn't for a degree of predictability. This film takes its time to limp down an arguably overly intimate path, but along the way, it is backed up by many an intriguing strength which prove to be the makings of a truly rewarding film, so for the final product to not reward, that means that the big issue here is Fred Zinnemann's attempt at a dryly British directorial storytelling style whose frequent quietness leads to a coldness to the bite of the dramatic tone and tension, and, of course, bores. Yes, the film is kind of dull, not at times, but all but consistently, having enough strong aspects to border on engrossing through and through, but still trying your investment through conventions, melodramatics and developmental shortcomings, and your patience through questionable pacing to the story structuring and storytelling. The final product cannot transcend underwhelmingness, but it does come close enough to meet all challenges to your investment with compelling traits that shine a light on the potential of this drama.\r\n\r\nA melodramatization of the legal and spiritual angles, and the controversies surrounding Henry VIII's seeking annulment, this story is politically, legally, religiously and even humanly charged, being intimate to the point of minimalism, but layered in its focusing on most all sides of this legendary story of a long-ago time whose convincingness is, of course, important in this drama. Terence Marsh's art direction, backed by production designer John Box and costume designer... whoever, goes well above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to restoring 16th-century England, not simply crafting designs which are convincing to begin with, but lavishly distinguishing them as good-looking in their intricacies, whose handsomeness is augmented by cinematography by Ted Moore which carries a rugged bleakness to capture a sense of grit to this subtly intense affair. I don't suppose the aesthetic integrity of this sophisticated, but light film is especially glowing, but there's so much taste in the overall craft of this handsome, immersive period drama, and it wouldn't be so effective if there wasn't taste to the manipulation of the style through direction. Director Fred Zinnemann manages to orchestra style with such delicacy because he approaches this film with a consistent thoughtfulness, and all too often, it is not justified in this already conceptually dry and steady drama, thus, the film falls to dullness, but not beneath respectability through a subtle, sophisticated atmosphere that holds a certain immediate intrigue, expanded upon by Zinnemann's finding material through which to deliver biting dramatic highlights. Robert Bolt's script is sure to provide some solid material for Zinnemann to work with, though far from consistently, hitting some tropes and overt histrionics while it drags along with repetitious plotting aspects, but aiding in securing some degree of engagement value through sharp, often outstanding dialogue of great wit, and through an audacious, often surprisingly tight exploration of thematically dynamic and consistently intimate narrative branches. Of course, the intimacy of this ensemble character drama truly thrives on the underwritten performances of talents so great that they transcend characterization thinness and deliver, whether it be the briefly present Orson Welles as an old and wise, yet trouble cardinal, or Robert Shaw as a flamboyant and problematic king, or John Hurt as a chancellor faced with a questionable case he might not be able to easily dismiss, or the primarily focused upon Paul Scofield as a hero of faith, respectability and tragedy whose worthy stances may only lead him deeper into trouble. These are but a few members in a cast full of solid performances, and although no one is truly great, the acting plays an instrumental part in driving this film to the brink of rewarding, helped greatly by sharp style and sophisticated, if questionable storytelling.\r\n\r\nOnce the seasons have come and gone, conventional and melodramatic attributes shake intrigue about as much as questionably structured expository depths, despite all of the repetitious dragging that is made all the more glaring by a cold - nay - dull thoughtfulness which secures the final product as underwhelming, but just barely, for conceptual intrigue, handsomely immersive art direction and cinematography, tasteful direction, sophisticated scripting, and across-the-board strong performances prove to be enough to make Fred Zinnemann's \"A Man of All Seasons\" an intriguing, if challenging period melodrama.\r\n\r\n2.75/5 - Decent",

            "content": "Okay this is the third to last best picture winner from the 60's.\n\nPlot: The film surrounds around Sir Thomas More back around the time of Kind Henry VIII in England. It begins with Cardinal Wolsey asking him to support his attempt in helping Henry VIII obtain a divorce from Catherine of Aragon, but More refuses. As a result, the council and even Henry VIII himself try to convince him to give his support. Meanwhile a young acquaintance of his named Richard Rich tries to think of ways to bring him down along with Thomas Cromwell.\n\nThis was just a nice movie for me honestly. As far as story goes, it's definitely nice because I do like the general tale about Henry VIII and his wives, which is what I particularly enjoyed a lot about the movie Anne of A Thousand Days. So naturally, a movie that has a little bit to do with that part of history would be interesting. And to an extent, it was. I'm pretty sure I never really even heard of Sir Thomas More from either when my mother would play this book on CD about Henry VIII or when I was studying about Europe in my history class during my senior year in high school. So it was a little nice to learn a little something from during the time between Henry VIII was working on divorcing Catherine of Aragon and a little after he married Anne Boleyn. But that doesn't necessarily mean I completely enjoyed the movie with little to no doubt whatsoever. Because putting all of that aside, I thought it was just an okay movie. It's wasn't that big of a film as far as an adaption from a play or otherwise, and not a lot of characters really stood out - except for Robert Shaw as Henry VIII who gave a performance that was good but a little different from how I interpret the person, especially when it came to his laugh which made me think more of Robin Hood from The Adventures of Robin Hood back in 1938. Also I will admit that the choice of cast was very interesting with having actors like Orson Welles and John Hurt.\n\n\nAnd that's my review for A Man of all Seasons. It's nothing special to me as a film, but it did still give a story that's set around the time of Henry VIII that makes it interesting enough to be a decent film to watch at the very least.",

Based on the play of the same name by Robert Bolt, it tackles a very high concept and complex subject matter, dealing with the inner workings of the formation of the Church of England by King Henry VIII during the 15th century, and one man's opposition to the motive. For the most part, director Fred Zinnemann successfully executes, crafting a film drenched in drama. The story of Thomas More is a deep and intricate tale, as his opposition to Henry's divorce and remarriage outside of church law makes him the only true honest man in the court, while also painting a huge target on his back. And Thomas More is brought to life in the career-defining performance from Paul Scofield, earning his Oscar and the Best Picture award almost singlehandedly. Not to say that the rest of the cast is any less impressive, though. Robert Shaw shines as King Henry, making him appear a man of erratic changes in emotion who desperately seeks moral approval for his actions. Leo McKern also gives a memorable turn as the corrupt Cromwell, who is the film's most identifiable villain. Strong supporting jobs are given from the renowned Orson Welles, a young John Hurt, Wendy Hiller, and Susannah York. The one weakness of the film is that the story struggles to transition from its turning point to its final act, dragging in the middle and potentially boring some viewers. Nevertheless, A Man for All Seasons is worthy of its Oscar, based solely on Scofield and the depth and gravity of its themes.",

This is a historical drama (which the Academy loves), so it makes sense also that this won some of the Big Awards, including Best Picture. \n\nI do love historicla movies, but this is one of those cases where a film that's feverishly historically accurate doesn't always mean it's going to be an enjoyable one...at least not for those looking for something with mainstream appeal and accessibility. \n\nThere's basically no action, and it's almost entirely a philosophical discussion/character study about two vastly dfifferent men with extremely clashing views/personalities. I dug it for the most part, but admittedly did find it hard to sit through and kinda boring here and there. \n\nStill though, you gotta give a lot of credit to it for the stellar cinematography, art direction, set design, and costumes. The attention to period details and historical accuracy are also to be appluaded, but it probably couldn't have hurt to put in some more action or somehting just to liven things up on occasion.\n\nThe direction is okay, but Zinnemann has done far better work. The writing is quite sharp and really nails the characters and subject matter, but what really sells the film are the performances. Paul Scofield reprises his role from the play, and rightfully earned an Oscar for his superb work. Robvert Shaw was awesome as Henry VIII, and he's definitely an actor worth checking out if all you know of him is his brilliant work in Jaws. Other notables in the cast invlude Vanessa Redgrave as Anne Boleyn, John Hurt as Richasrd RIch, and Orson Welles, whose turn as Cardinal Wolsey is terrific just ofr the sheer fact that it's cool to see him rocking the always photogenic Cardinal robes. \n\nThis is a hard film to get into, and more for the patient intellectuals than those who like action oriented history based works, but it's got some great themes and materia lworth discussing, so all in all, it's a fine film, but not one I would necessarily say is totally deserving of Best Picture.",

Yet, political disgrace still means death and Sir Thomas More, outnumbered by political foes and men who bend to the king's will to remarry, stands alone.

When a King could order a severed head on a whim and his subjects grovelled like loyal puppies keen for a feed? Ah yes, how times have changed.\r\n\r\nA Man For All Seasons is not about King Henry the VIII (Robert Shaw). Not really. It's about a man of principals, a man of faith, Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield). The King is a mad man on a mission to grab as much power as he can. He has cast himself as God, religion-maker, rule changer. With an 'off-with-their-heads' attitude, the King demands that the English embrace a new church, simply so he can divorce  Queen Catherine and marry Anne Boleyn (Vanessa Redgrave).\r\n\r\nMore is a strict Catholic kinda man, loyal to the Pope and not to the King. He knows that this will cause him strife but he's determined to stick to his principles, at least in his own mind. Spies, power struggles and the word 'traitor' is flung about willy-nilly and many heads find themselves rolling around on the gritty floor.\r\n\r\nFor those who cannot handle historical films, this may be well worth a look. Instead of being bogged down in details, this film takes you on a journey through the mucky world of 16th Century England. Unlike today where politicians are happy to air their dirty laundry in our faces, in Henry VIII's world, opinions were suppressed. For good reason too. Henry wasn't out to be King of the year but to simply do whatever he wanted. In the end... well you'll have to watch it, but in the end the King pays the price for heresy and selfishness. Long live the King! Or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n'A Man For All Seasons' Trivia:\r\n\r\n* Budget - $3,900,000\r\n* Styrofoam was ordered to create the snowy scenes but as they arrived the real stuff came sprinkling down.\r\n* Vanessa Redgrave wouldn't accept payment for her role.\r\n* Imagine if the film had Laurence Olivier as Sir Thomas and Alec Guinness as Wolsey... as the producers wanted. But Director Fred Zinnemann got his way and his men.\r\n* This film is based on a play by Robert Bolt starring Paul Scofield and Leo McKern.\r\n* The filming took a mere 12 weeks.\r\n* Thomas was the first name of 5 of the main people the play was based on. Bolt only kept 2 the same.",

But because I love history and old films, I was really drawn into this film, invested in the characters and I cared about what happened to these people. Thomas More is one of the greatest cinematic heroes that doesn't get enough recognition.

Though frowned upon, no one would argue with the will of the King's, so all the leads of the Church of England obeyed King Henry's will. Except for one. Thomas More was the only man standing in the King's way from geting a devorce approval from the Pope. This is a very interesting true story about one man vs. society, what others deem right and wrong, whether orders should be obeyed, (especially if it's from the freaken king!) and staying true to one's beliefs.\r\n\r\nFred Zinnermann (High Noon, From Here to Eternity) was definitely not worried about making an appealing movie. The lack of diagetic music sets a very depressing mood though the whole movie, and there's not a lot to be attracted to. Although, the sets and costumes are stunningly detailed to historical portrayal. This movie also has some great thought into the cinematography, in which all other rooms in the movie are dark, but in Thomas More's house daylight is always present. There's no romanticised features in this movie, but by observing them closely, there is lots to be impressed with in this movie.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, this is a pretty dull movie. It's slow and characters are generally unappealing, facing subject matter only attractive as a history lesson. It's a movie about going against the King, so there isn't a lot of relevance for today's society. But then again I think the point of the movie is that it's not supposed to be relevant or appealing. The fact that no one likes what More is doing sets a very destinct character, and what he stands for isn't about his Christian beliefs but that the order of the King is no greater nor more right than a fool's belief. It's not the most entertaining movie, but its a full hearted lession teacher that great actors and great writing bring out.",

Paul Scofield was(insert any superlative praise here) as Thomas More, a man who fought Henry VIII's morally questionable marriage to Anne Boleyn, not by too much of words, but by the mere power of silence, and a constant strength of his convictions. With a film like this, one can even predict halfway through that this would certainly climax in a trial scene(and I was certainly right), with the actor portraying the protagonist uttering some 3-page long oration. But I was quite surprised at how Paul Scofield has done that particular scene. He has portrayed Thomas More as a worn-out individual, and though capable of answering and speaking, chooses not to do much. Instead of a sprawling speech that I have expected, I have witnessed a very brief one, but with a power never much diminished by its shortness. Apart from it being a showcase of some very fine acting, \"A Man for all Seasons\" has also showed the \"not-so-likable\" side of 16th century England, perfectly countered with a very moving story of unconditional martyrdom.",

            "content": "\"A Man for All Seasons\" was the big winner at the 1966's Oscars. It won 6, Picture, Actor (Paul Scofield), director (Fred Zinnemann, who had also won the double film/director in 1953 with \"From Here to Eternity\"), writing, costume design and cinematography. Looking at other contenders of that year, it appears as no surprise, even if the movie was worse than it was. This is much more a movie of ideas and ideals than a movie of action, its acting is presented as the most powerful feature, and there is a certain delicacy in the dialogues. Based on the stage play of the same name (which also won the Tony for Best Play and Actor for Scofield), it tells of the last years of Sir Thomas Moore's life, after he fails to recognize King Henry VIII's right to marry Ann Boleyn and the institution of the church of England. A philosopher and a great thinker, Moore never gives in to pressures, and very wittingly holds his ground until he is arrested and ultimately tried for high treason. Zinemman gives some continuity to the scenes notably taken straight from the play by introducing some transitions, some changing in settings and one or two amusing details (such as the court following the king around). But he is very unobtrusive in his directing, leaving the actors to give the essence to the picture, but also taking exquisite account of the detail, the clothes, the accessories, the buildings and the art of the 16th century. Scofield is superb as Moore, giving him an almost zen-like quality in his soft voice, which only fails him at the end. Ever the righteous man, ever the utopianist, but also very human in his convictions. His greatest adversary, Cromwell, the man who tries him, is played by bulldog-like Leo McKern, a menacing presence. Other supporting cast include Robert Shaw as the king, playing him as an joyous fellow without much interest in affairs except his own, John Hurt in his first role as the man who sells Moore out, Wendy Hiller, always the icy emotional lady as Moore's wife and notably Orson Wells, in one single scene at the beginning, powerful off course, completely in command, a presence that stays with you until the end. The movie gains by Moore's way of being, never being portrait as a martyr but as a man of convictions, a visionary ahead of its time, and a Christian to the full sense of the word. If the real man had any doubts... well, one assumes that he may have had, but the movie carefully avoids that. He is portrayed as immaculate, but that doesn't take the power of the moral the movie presents, neither of the fascination of the main character, who never does anything fancy nor challenging, except to talk. Fantastic screenplay which moves the movie and never makes it dull, whose heart is Paul Scoffield's performance, and which has great details of the epoch. To know the legend of Thomas Moore, and also to give a moral about fighting for your convictions till the end. Ultimately, it is about the power of the word that makes the law. Are laws just words or are they something more? A scholar movie which can have many parallels in current affairs.",

The film would have a brilliant lead role, and a brilliant supporting cast to it's name. It's a low-key story, but still quite powerful. It focuses on Thomas More (Paul Scofield) who is caught in a struggle with Henry VIII (Robert Shaw), who wishes to divorce Catherine of Aragon, and marry Anne Boleyn instead. Cardinal Wolsey (Orson Welles) wants the Pope to grant them a divorce, and he needs More's help, but More being a devout Catholic refuses. More is made Lord Chancellor of England by Henry, but one comment regarding Henry is picked up by Thomas Cromwell (Leo McKern), who uses one of More's old acquantances from Cambridge, Richard Rich (John Hurt) to spy on More and his family. It's a fairly straight forward story, and to the point as well. It's beautifully shot by Ted Moore, and Georges Delerue's traditional score is good on the ear, but it's Scofield's restrained, down to earth, human role as More which makes the film all the more engaging. It's a pity there wasn't more of Shaw's powerful Henry VIII, who nearly steals the film from Scofield.",

If you don't like a film that is primarily composed of talking, this film isn't for you, but be warned you are missing out.  This is a showcase for great British performance, and also represents a prominent moment in the history of England.  Despite these elements composing the bulk of the film, Zinnemann still proves he is a skilled director, as the cinematography is beautiful and the color is more striking than I expected from a film from 1966.  Something about it feels very fresh, but not so fresh that the period setting doesn't feel unauthentic.  The film still works 40 years later, which is reason enough to warrant merit, but it is also a terrific religious film for the those of the faith, as it doesn't feel preachy but echoes a powerful message.",

            "content": "\"'A Man for All Seasons' is a picture that inspires admiration, courage and thought.\" - New York Times \r\n\r\nThis is a historic tale which centers around Sir Thomas More's conscientious plight not just against the king of England but with himself. Against an overwhelming tide More is bent on standing firm to his own convinctions despite the ramifications that come with opposing the wishes of the king... especially one as ruthless as Henry VIII. \r\n\r\nThe wryly principled \"man for all seasons\" is acted superbly by Paul Scofield as one who, although unwilling to compromise his valued morals, does share a mutual respect with the king (and we find King Henry does greatly admire and respect More, and is dismayed by his silence). Despite their affection for one another More is foremost a man unable by virtue to please the king at such a high expense as the wrongness of damning his own soul. This truly is an immaculate showcase of cinema shining through at its best, of the back-and-forths between such rich characters, no matter their relevance to the story... every character is important, drawn and fleshed out to More's dilemma and the central theme of having to keep one's person intact despite any temptations or opposition that would blemish it. \r\n\r\nAMFAS is known for its articulate and awe-inspiring dialogue and well-acted performances, it's also a very well-directed film from Fred Zinneman (who'd also made \"High Noon\" and \"From Here to Eternity\"; those pictures have nothing on this!) and flawlessly edited to where all scenes flow seemlessly together without one \"off\" moment or scene that feels misplaced. And on top of all this: AMFAS is breathlessly stunning as a visual piece to just gawk over. Its Academy wins for best cinematography and best costume design were understandably well-earned. \r\n\r\nThis picture is one of a slim few that does profoundly affect me to where I'll still reflect back on it long after any viewing. More's struggles and the way he handles them, how this true story gives us centuries and maybe even millenia of modeled character in action, how Sir Thomas More had in fact given his life to stand on his principle, and the great Paul Scofield's long-reaching performance as More is what all stays with me. Even his final words to onetime friend Richard is everlasting, wait for it! As a viewer who grows with concern it's difficult to watch More, with such grace and decency - pure dignity - succumbing to eventual harsh treatment and deprived from his wife and daughter. He's too good. Which brings me back to why \"A Man for All Seasons\" remains distinctly with me: how far would we go to protect what we see as the essence of ourselves, of keeping our souls intact when dealing with overwhelming and life-threatening adversity?",
