I didn't know that he really had schizophrenia and found myself siding with the hallucinations almost the entire way through the movie as it didn't seem so farfetched in the context of the Cold War that the Russians might actually want to interfere with an important codebreaker's life! They tried to pull the rug out from under me when he's tackled at the college but I instead held onto that rug like it was a scooter whose handlebars were made out of my own ignorance. It's hard to judge the sentimentality for me as I would imagine contemporaneous viewers had been shown trailers for the movie that reveal its true nature and so I can't have had the experience I was intended to have. That said, I did love Russell's performance, particularly his interesting speech patterns, and Ed Hairless has never made a bad movie. I've been watching Connelly in TNT's Snowpiercer show and loved seeing her in this; she's hardly aged a day in the 20 years that separate the movie and that show. I'm not so sure that Ron deserved a Best Director Oscar for this as surely directing Moulin Rouge! would've been more difficult, but whatever. I did enjoy watching this, even if I understood it way too late lol!",

It's interesting how the film looks at mental illness and how this one in particular is treated over the decades in both the medical and societal sense. I get that it can be difficult to depict mental illness in stories, you need do be honest about it or at least depict it in a way that is understandable to people who don't get it but you don't want to patronize or worse fetishize it. At the time maybe this was groundbreaking but I think it falls into slightly problematic territory almost 20 years later, especially how the character decides to figure it out on their own without help and how his illness makes him \"special\". Apparently the story takes some liberties with its source material though. They do cover some thoughtful topics: Being someone who is ill and struggling to relate or fit in, What it's like to be someone taking care of someone with a mental illness; how you can love them and want to help them but also be frustrated with the situation. The pacing is a little choppy in the first half and gets a bit better in the second. And some of the plot lines left me going \"really?\" more than once. I'm torn on it. I wouldn't say I liked it, but it does have some redeeming qualities.",

Russell Crowe does an amazing job portraying the main character John Nash as someone who is continuously learning about the world, and more importantly, himself. Jennifer Connolly also had a stellar performance as John Nash's wife, with a performance strong and full of passion and emotion. This beautiful story was wonderfully constructed with how it presents itself to the audience as well as including an extremely shocking and unexpected plot twist with a very inspirational ending about overcoming anything no matter what obstacle.\n\"A Beautiful Mind\" is definitely one of those movies that absolutely requires another watch because of how much detail is put into the movie. Giving this movie another watch will definitely give the entire movie a whole new feeling and will offer clues to the audience that they never would have noticed in their first time watching it, which is what makes this movie so unique. Despite the movie's slow start, it completely makes up for it in it's action-packed, plot twist of a second half. The movie does a really good job on touching on the topic of mental illnesses by showing how people dealing with mental illnesses deal with them, as well as how their loved one's are affected and deal with it. Overall, I highly recommend this movie, especially if you love movies with a plot twist.",

            "content": "We conclude our Dreamworks trilogy with A Beautiful Mind, the first biopic on the list since... Schindler's List. This one focuses on Nobel Prize-winning mathematician and Princeton professor John Forbes Nash, Jr (Russell Crowe) and his achievement in success, his marriage with Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and his struggle with schizophrenia. His hallucinations include his old college roommate Charles (Paul Bettany), his niece, and government agent Parcher (Ed Harris) who assigns him to crack Russian codes via magazines. The movie really splits into two parts: Nash's Princeton days and his battle with the disorder. However, these pieces puzzle together as the movie progresses, resulting in an often disjointed and conventional, but still fascinating casserole. With that said, Crowe nails the paranoia and awkwardness of the late mathematician, Connelly is terrific as his frustrated moral support, and Bettany brings life to his frat boyish, vulgar roommate illusion. What was disappointing of Ron Howard's achievement was that the ending left it preclusive to interpretation, leaving easy resolutions. The fact that Nash ignores the hallucinations at the Nobel Prize ceremony was sentimental and redundant, especially since we just saw that final nail before the pens were gathered. I wished the film ended with a more poignant and complex ending, like the deleted scene where only Alicia attended the award show and the rest of the audience were figments of his hallucinations. Despite its traditional and uneven storyline, A Beautiful Mind keeps its love of complex mathematics and gives us a fairly satisfying biopic. \n\n(3 ½ Umbrella Constellations out of 5)",

It goes forward in time very quickly and often it does not explain everything and elements of Nash's life i would have liked to have seen more. I would have liked some of Nash's childhood mentioned, more of how he understands and controls his condition and more of Nash and his wife relationship before marriage. The film has snapshot moments and does not do Nash full justice. Large elements are not historical accurate. I don't fully know why Nash is a famous mathematician. The moments in the clinic and moments with Connolly is the where the film is strongest. We see the strain on his wife through who smashing up the bathroom and her frustration. The almost death of their baby is important as Nash slowly understands that he sees people. But the film jumps to him as good professor and then to when he gets the Nobel  prize that is feels badly edited. I would love to watch a decent film about Nash's life and condition.

            "content": "This movie is one of my favorite movies for many reasons but mainly because they represent a real story in such a cinematic manner (for lack of a better phrase). That is this such a good movie that if you were to watch this without context, you would not guess that it's a true story. That is not to say that the best movies are the most unrealistic ones but that the cinematic technique was so smooth that it's hard to think this actually happened. The cinematic techniques, the message, and the performance delivered by Russell Crowe help make this movie what it is.\n\tMaking the viewer unaware of John Nash's condition and making them see from his perspective before revealing the truth is an ingenious method of having the viewer hooked. Ron Howard uses false consciousness to present a story before working through genuine moments of dramatic conflict mainly through the wife Alicia when she finds out Nash's condition and through Nash himself later on. There are, however, many hints to the audience that these are hallucinations at the beginning of the movie. Towards the start of the movie, we see Nash holding a glass that he twists to see how light is fractured – a reference to how he can see ‘beautiful' things that other people cannot. Additionally, most of the shots with his hallucinations are tight close-ups that can symbolize him feeling trapped or confined by his hallucinations. We also always hear his hallucinations before seeing them which is representative of the primarily auditory nature of schizophrenic visions.\n\tBeing able to live Nash's reality before finding out about his paranoid Schizophrenia provides an intersubjective view of mental illnesses that is not normally presented in movies – most famously Girl, Interrupted and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. There are multiple hints at how Nash is entrapped by his illness as seen by the many doorways and windows in the movie. Most specifically, he is seen several times peeping out of his window. The first half of the movie is almost completely seen from Nash's perspective; if the camera isn't on John or showcasing the scene from his point of view, it would be a crane or dolly camera seeking him out from within the crowd. This helps immerses us in his world so much that his diagnosis is just as much a shock to us as to him. There is a deeper sense of showcasing the micro individual experience of mental illnesses and the toll they have on someone's life. In Nash's case, as well as many others', they never recover from their illness just work through it.",

My point is that, rare heroes like mathematicians and their contributions are never discussed. Which is why I was glad to watch A Beautiful Mind. It's unique story, acting, direction, cinematography and dialogues all pull you in the story and never let you go even after the credits roll. Russel Crowe and Jennifer Connelly give great performances. The supporting cast are also good. Tracing the life of John Nash from his university to his work the script never feels dull or boring. Admittedly, the first half feels slow, but interesting nonetheless. When things pick up in the second half, you find yourself glued to the screen. Minor negatives would be the run time. A good 10-15 minutes could have been cut without making no impact to this story whatsoever. With that said, A Beautiful Mind is an inspiring story of overcoming everything life throws at you.

There are some loose strings: When Nash flees the men from the mental institution, he leaves behind his briefcase, which the camera lingers over, but we never see again (there was probably a deleted scene showing its contents). In one line Nash's partner says she will be working late, but we never learn what her job is, nor is that relevant to the story, so we might infer she is having an affair, but this is never explored or explained either. Overall, A Beautiful Mind is a good movie that suffers a little bit for what is missing than for what is actually on the screen.",

I tried my best to keep my bias out of this review and to be honest, it was quite easy. Ron Howard is at his best, the cast is perfectly cast and can we talk about how underrated this soundtrack is? This movie takes on the burden of showing what schizophrenia truly is and how even the most gifted cannot think their way out of it. Furthermore, it captures who John Nash is and what he meant for the future of economics, for the future of the world as we know it. It's not about the Nobel Prize he won in 1994 but about how it was won. What John Nash gave up and went through to achieve his breakthroughs are shown with poise and elegance with the help of the soundtrack and the wonderful direction of Howard. Let's not forget Jennifer Connolly as Alicia Nash; the joy and pain that she shows helped translate what John Nash's mind was really doing to, not only himself, but the people around him.",

            "content": "This is one of the first real disappointments I have seen as I attempt to watch every Best Picture winner ever. I went in expecting a solid biopic/psychological drama and instead I got a competently directed film with a great Jennifer Connelly performance and not much else. The major issue with this film is that everything gets mawkishly overplayed, the things that were handled well initially slid into melodrama during the second half and the whole film left me rather nonplussed. If they were going to reward Ron Howard they should have done it for Apollo 13 (1995) or The Paper (1994) both of which play to his talents far more and aren't predicated on an Akiva Goldsman screenplay. It's a flawed but enjoyable film with some elements that deserved to be rewarded however it is no way better than In the Bedroom (2001) or Gosford Park (2001).\n\nJohn Forbes Nash, Russell Crowe, is a mathematical genius who struggles with social interactions as he arrives at the prestigious Princeton University in 1947. We see him develop the mathematical theories that he will become famous for, face down his less talented foes and fall in love with his student, Alicia, Jennifer Connelly. What the film is more interested in is the paranoid schizophrenia that Nash faced later in his life and how his delusions of William Parcher, Ed Harris, effected his marriage and his career. When those around him find out they try their hardest to be supportive but face issues as he continues to relapse into his old ways.\n\nThe first thing I must remark upon is Connelly's performance because she is fantastic despite the screenplay she is working with and fully deserved her Best Supporting Actress Academy Award. She is able to make her character more than just the suffering but supportive wife as we see her quiet desperation and love in all of her interactions and when she essentially becomes the main character for a large portion of the film she is extremely compelling. She also manages to pull off her accent better than Crowe, who struggles to maintain a Southern lilt, and to display a certain enthusiasm for their relationship. The one moment that ruins her character's development, which is entirely the fault of Goldsman and Howard, is her freak-out in which she smashes all of the glass objects in their bathroom. It was unnecessary and the filmmakers would have been wise to employ some subtlety in conveying the effect that Nash's mental disorder had on his life.\n\nThe issues I had with the film were Crowe's performance, the obvious direction and the ham-fisted dialogue. Crowe can be a great actor and he possesses charisma as seen in The Insider (1999) and The Nice Guys (2016) but here he seems like he's doing a bad impersonation and he never shakes that lack of authenticity throughout the film. Of course the terrible prosthetics when he is seen as an old man don't help him but I wanted him to do something other than awkwardly stuttering and stating rather inappropriate requests as though they were perfectly logical. \n\nHoward is a strong comedic and dramatic director but no one would call him subtle and here we see Nash picking up on various conspiracies through white flashes and shots of Crowe's eyebrows shooting upwards. Because we are meant to believe he is a savant Howard does get to use some of his abilities as a comedic director but even then the punch-lines are so obvious it's hard to laugh. Goldsman is a poor screenwriter, he's the man behind Batman and Robin (1997), and here it shows as I fully expected Crowe to state the title of the film during most of his monologues. Every line drips with contrivance and when Harris is revealed to be not who you think he is he becomes a cartoon. \n\nThis is a film that is perfectly entertaining and certainly better than The Imitation Game (2014) or The Theory of Everything (2014) but it will leave you wanting something more. If you want to see a great film about a paranoid schizophrenic watch Images (1972). In the Bedroom (2001) would have been my Best Picture winner this year and I find it sad that something so flawed is now in the history books as the supposed best film released in a year.",

Tragically, I learned from Wikipedia something that would have been the ultimate downer if noted at the end of the movie: \nOn May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife were killed in a vehicle accident on the New Jersey Turnpike near Monroe Township, New Jersey. They had been on their way home from the airport after a visit to Norway, where Nash had received the Abel Prize, when their taxicab driver lost control of the vehicle and struck a guardrail. Both passengers were ejected from the car upon impact. State police revealed that it appeared neither passenger was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.",

John Nash is a genius dreaming of originality and recognition in the work that he does. A sudden discovery of mental illness and the world-crashing affects it can have on those around such an illness is shown in its brutality. We live out this hero's tale every step of the way. \n\nNow to touch on a few things, the story telling in a Beautiful Mind was superb, I found myself wanting the delusions to be true (purely on the interesting nature of the illusion itself) The character of John Nash completes its hero's journey with poise, a hungry beginning full of trial and the need to do something great. A crashing realization that shakes the character to their roots, and the moment of truth, choosing the harder and more rewarding road. Alicia Nash is strong in her resolve and shows how supporting someone in such a mental state can be just as taxing as having schizophrenia. She is the rock of John Nash and really is the only reason he probably got through what he did. Alicia is clever, smart, strong, and loving. She's independent and could've easily left John but choose the harder road and overcame this mental antagonist with John every step of the way. \n\nThe acting was not only on par with the leads but with supporting actors as well, and in the end we come full circle to one of the most satisfying endings to a movie that I've seen since Cinderella Man, which had the same actor, who woulda thought. \n\nI don't think the movie is perfect but I find myself having trouble grabbing onto anything substantial that distracted from the story-telling shown here. \n\nYes I would watch this movie again, I would recommend it to a friend, and I feel that I am a better person coming out of this story than I was going into it. What more could I ask for?",

There are a lot of movies that hinge on those reveals, and if you don’t get that surprise it can hurt your overall impression of the film. So I was leery going into A Beautiful Mind, because I knew what was coming, and didn’t know how it would work without any suspense. I’m trying to avoid spoiling anything for readers of this review, but I will say I was a bit surprised how obvious they made it (although it probably seems more obvious when you know what’s happening.) The one nice thing is that the truth is revealed much earlier than I expected. This wasn’t a twist that is thrown out in the final minutes of the film, but it almost comes at the halfway point. I was intrigued by the difficulties that John Nash faced, and how it affected his work. It made for a dramatic and heart-wrenching story. I only wish there was greater focus put on his work itself. It seemed they were so preoccupied with his issues, that they didn’t take the time to establish his intelligence. The film is about his relationships, and his life dealing with a mind that was betraying him, not on who he was as a person and why he was worthy of the many awards he received. With any biopic there are choices that need to be made to decide what areas of the person’s life you want to focus on, and clearly this was their chosen route. It wasn’t a bad choice, but I would be a little more interested if they looked at the science and mathematics of it all. The hardest thing for me to deal with in A Beautiful Mind was how close they came to a perfect cast. I love every actor in this entire film (particularly Jennifer Connelly) with only one exception. I cannot fathom why Russell Crowe was selected to play John Nash. He can’t act, and he certainly doesn’t have the skill to play the nuance of this role. There is so much going on inside the character’s head, and I get none of it from Crowe who always struggles to emote, particularly when he has to fake an American accent. Despite my issues with the movie, I still was interested in the plot, and Ron Howard is good at manipulating emotions. So I was impacted by A Beautiful Mind, and found it to be a decent story, but not one I’ll rush to watch again.",

Ron Howard directs with a tender understanding of this man's fragile mental state. We see the brilliant mind of John Nash reduced over time with paranoia. \n\nHoward crafts the sincere beginnings of a hopeful mathematician to the paranoid struggle of a broken man. A Beautiful Mind builds empathy for Nash with Roger Deakins' gorgeous shots and James Horner's haunting score. The somber notes swell from lovely to lonely moods.\n\nRussell Crowe is inspired as John Nash. He plays the character with such sympathy and nuance. You feel for Nash and his plight because of how realistically genuine Crow portrays Nash.\n\nFurthermore, Jennifer Connelly is incredible as Nash's wife. She suffers just as much as he does, but in a different way. Connelly's capability to demonstrate a working wife struggling to provide for her family at odds is something to behold.\n\nSimilarly, Ed Harris and Paul Bettany play fascinating supporting roles. You watch their characters take on a whole new meaning by the end. The way that Harris and Bettany play these roles is shocking and entertaining to the last frame with them.\n\nLastly, I love Christopher Plummer's smaller cameo role as the Dr. Rosen. He is empathetic and intriguing in his performance. We get to see Plummer dive into how to speak to someone troubled with a level of respect and understanding.\n\nOverall, I think most audiences will love A Beautiful Mind. Every since it was released in 2001, I have had this movie burned into my mind. It is memorable evermore.",

            "content": "I was going to title this review with an A Beautiful Mind pun, but I didn't. I'm sure hundreds of other puns already exist about this (semi) brilliant movie. It's important to note that this movie is adapted from a novel by the same name, which was published in 1998 by Columbia Journalism professor, Sylvia Nasaar. It's also important that this book is an unauthorized biography. Dr. Nash himself stated, in an Al Jazeera Interview from 2009, that the movie and the book are inaccurate when it came to how he coped with his schizophrenia (among other things). Nash doesn't support the use of medication when it comes to treating his mental illness. Especially after he was subjected to it during his involuntary hospital stays, where he was not only subjected to pills, but insulin shock therapy. Dr. Nash said that the screen writer was in cahoots with the pharmaceutical and psychiatric industry. He thinks that they wanted to keep people on their prescriptions. In addition, Nash rightfully said (paraphrased), how can you show one man's life in just a few hours? The movie does end on a high note, without talking about Nash's son's schizophrenia. It's hard to review a movie when the real-life subject of the film disagrees with it so vehemently. Should we hate the film for not representing his life correctly? Or praise it for taking on issues of mental illness (but of course in a bias way)? Well, like always, we should place it in a grey area. It has its positive traits as well as its negative ones, and we're here to find out what is what.\n \nI tried watching this film 2 years ago and I just couldn't get through the first 40 minutes. I thought that the director, Ron Howard, was just making this film as an excuse to bring a real-life Sheldon Cooper-esque scientist to life, so he could be sexist and mock socially inept people. But I finally gave the film another shot. This time, I was determined to make it through the whole thing. The first hour was still filled with the male gaze, where soon to be Doctor, John Nash, was given a free pass for his patriarchal notions because he was just an \"awkward (yet loveable) scientist.\" But soon you learn the harsh reality of the real-life Dr. John Nash. Dr. Nash suffered from schizophrenia (paranoia), which went untreated for the first thirty years or so of his life, until it became unbearable, not only for him, but those around him. We, as the audience, realize that the first act (or the first hour) of Howard's film was to set us up for a punch to the gut, as well as the heart.\n \nI cried throughout the end of this film because of how many emotions I experienced. First, there's disgust at how sexist they make him in the film, but also at how much he's bullied for being an introvert. Secondly, there's intrigue at how his life took such a curious turn. All bets are off. Thirdly, there's the reveal. Not just realizing that he has schizophrenia, but at the horrors of 1950s and 1960s mental health care. Lastly, there's the happy ending, which is only semi warranted. Yes, he won the Nobel Prize for economics in real life, but they choose to end it with that, and not on the fact that he still battles with his mental illness, as well as his son's. Without further ado, the prodigal review returns!\n \nThe film centers around Dr. John Nash, a doctorate student at Princeton. At first, he seems like a loner, and perhaps is suffering from some case of autism or Asperger's. He has no friends, except his imaginary friend/roommate - Charles. His acquaintances think he's strange, but as long as they can make fun of him, they keep him around. After coming up with his doctorate thesis, he and two of his acquaintances go to MIT Wheeler labs to work. One day, he's invited to the Pentagon to decode a message from the Russians. He's able to solve it and that's when his mental illness starts to get the better of him. He starts thinking he's a messenger, out of the need to be recognized as super intelligent, do something important, and because he's extremely keen at finding patterns. He just can't help but see them everywhere. And that just fuels his belief that he has a special mission to save the U.S. That, and the fact that the U.S. is in the height of the cold war and the red scare has taken over his mind. Nash also teaches at MIT. There, he meets his future wife Alicia. They get married and everything seems fine, until Nash's schizophrenia becomes crippling, not only for him, but for his wife and baby. He's involuntarily committed to an institution. In the film, it appears that his insulin shock treatments are voluntary since he realizes that his hallucinations and voices aren't real. We may never know the true story, but that's how they portray it in the film. We also see that he starts taking medicine on and off after he's released. In the film, we see the pills and medication as debilitating. He's slow and sluggish when he takes them, as opposed to jumpy. But as \"pill technology\" gets better, he starts to take them again and feel better (in the film). By the end, he can ignore his hallucinations (because the red scare is over and he's no longer needed as a messenger) and he is a respected professor at Princeton. He even wins the Nobel prize in economics.\n \nThe film ends on a happy and inspirational note. And indeed, it is for many people. But it's also important to discover the truth. Though Nash didn't approve of the film or book himself, he did say that it would help start the conversation about mental illness (2009 Al Jazeera interview).\n \nLet's talk about the performances. I think Russell Crowe does a phenomenal job, not as Nash himself, but just being a believable actor. I see Nash, not Crowe. He's dramatic and over the top, subtle yet awkward, emotionless when he needs to be, and just overall great at interacting with his surroundings. It looks as though he fits right in at Princeton, MIT, and with the government. The makeup artists also deserve a lot of credit for aging him, making him look depleted and sleep deprived, as well as mistreated and sick. He sells their image beautifully, even if that image is sort of contrived. Look, \"I can control my mental illness with the use of drugs (even though I didn't in real life).\" Nash said that the progression of time was warped, which it is, but I think the movie illustrates it well without annoying time cards at the end of every era. There are time cards spaced evenly throughout the film, and most of the time you can tell the passing of time with his hair or clothing. I also think Ed Harris does a great job as Parcher, basically, A Beautiful Mind's Man in Black (Westworld reference). He's so over dramatic and there. His urgency, presence, and the way he sells the illusion to us, and Nash is incredible. Less can be said with Jennifer Connelly as Alicia. Not only was she supposed to be from El Salvador, but she always gives these blank expressions that look like she was uninterested in the film, or just gazing off into space. I know that was supposed to be her confused look, but even her confused look managed to look bored. The real Alicia Nash went on from being one of the small percentage of women studying at MIT, to an aerospace engineer at RCA, and a system programmer at Con Edison, and later, a data analyst for NJ Transit.  \n \nI'm assuming that Howard's intention with this film was to raise awareness about mental illnesses and how horribly mental illness patients were treated in the 50s and 60s. However, little is mentioned about how mental illness patients are still mistreated, and the stigma that still goes along with them. Though Nash in the film suffered from bullying and skepticism about his work (due to his mental illness), he did triumph over some hurdles by being extremely intelligent naturally and having some credibility before being publicly diagnosed. The film does save face by stating he was extremely privileged through his family connections. He wouldn't have gotten to be where he was without his brains, but also being a white male. Though in the film they say he was awarded a scholarship/grant and was estranged from his family, in reality, his family helped a lot when it came to getting him into the right schools to expand his innate mathematical genius. In addition, because of the already established stereotype/trope of the \"mad genius,\" his madness wasn't seen as \"that bad.\" Though it was to him, it could be a privilege compared to lesser educated people who have mental illnesses and are just seen as \"crazy street mumblers.\" \n\nThe beginning of the film is also kind of insufferable. It's extremely sexist when talking about women. They're only seen as objects to have sex with, to be had, or won, not individuals. I guess it plays into the whole Ivy league male stereotype - even though they're nerds, because they have the prestige of going to one of the best colleges in the country, they're the epitome of manliness. Therefore, they're misogynists, and of course, they all want \"the blonde.\" The women barely have any names. The jokes in the first act are also based on Nash's social ineptitude with women, just like Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory.\n \nThe second act, when we see Nash working for the government and the film really comes together. This is when I think that the film is brilliant. We see what Nash sees, so it's hard during the reveal to believe that he's mentally ill. We still think that the psychiatrist is a Russian spy, because everything has been from Nash's viewpoint and we trust him. We never thought of him as an unreliable narrator because of how innocently smart he was. We got scared with Nash that he was being followed, we got scared when he went to drop off his classified documents, and we really thought he was helping the government find a portable H-Bomb being brought to the U.S. by the Russians. I think that was the genius of the film. It's when the reveal happens, we're still on Nash's side, until his wife takes over and we see that he was suffering from delusions. It proves how easily it is to be sucked into film, but also how trusting we are of narrators when we only get one POV.\n \nI guess if the film was to be called \"inspirational\" or \"starting a conversation,\" it could illustrate how seemingly simple Asperger's can turn into so much more if untreated or undetected. At first, we just see Crowe's portrayal of Nash as comical. And that should be a huge shame on us as the audience. In fact, one later scene in the third act shows Nash's own audience (college students at Princeton) mocking the way he walks. Maybe that's Howard's use of turning the blame on us. And that's perhaps, where it should be. We didn't know where this film was taking us, we were laughing because socially awkward people are shunned and dismissed. But in reality, he was suffering and we couldn't see it. But maybe that's the point. The film shows how mental illness can be born not only psychologically, but out of social situations.\n \nI also liked in the end that the guy we thought was the bully, turns out to be his friend at Princeton and a helpful colleague later in his life. He even defends and protects Nash from being bullied by his own students. Illustrating that people can change, and that people care about Nash and want to help him.\n \nOf course, the film is about and stars a white southerner, who's rich and privileged, and a genius/gentleman. Of course, his story gets told. But his privilege doesn't dismiss the importance of his story. At the same time, it's important to remember that we should also talk about lower class, and other types of mentally ill people. We should acknowledge that  mental illness, isn't solved in a few hours, or by a few pills, as Nash himself said. Despite the flaws in the film, the actors deserve a lot of credit. Though Crowe himself doesn't have schizophrenia, portraying mental illness isn't the same as portraying race. It would be cruel and an unethical punishment to make an actor with schizophrenia pretend to see the illusions and go through scenarios of another schizophrenic. I can't speak for schizophrenic people, there may be someone who would love to play Nash. This is just my opinion as an ally, and please correct me if I'm wrong. Crowe did his best, and I think it shows. I also liked how it started the conversation about mental illness, but sadly, cut it short.\n \nOverall, I give the film an 8/10. Though it's highly inaccurate, go see it knowing the inaccuracies, and decide for yourself whether this film is one of the best of the 21st century. Hopefully in the future, films portraying the lives and needs of lower class mentally ill people will be made.",

Whether it be Rush, Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon, or A Beautiful Mind, he has a knack for representing real people well while also adding some movie magic in there as well.\n\nThe first time I watched A Beautiful Mind I was blown away by it. Not only did I think all of the actors did a tremendous job sinking their teeth into each role, but I couldn't believe how fascinating John Nash's life was. This is a man was a student at Princeton and made significant contributions to the world of mathematics and economics (including proposing several theories and equations), all while being diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic.\n\nRussell Crowe gives one of his best performances as John Nash, in what also may be his most challenging. Crowe has to make it believable that he's both one of the brightest minds in the world but also someone who is seriously struggling with mental illness. He has great chemistry with his love interest, Alicia Nash, played by Jennifer Connelly. In fact, I think this film is a better romance than it is a biopic. Connelly, who won an Oscar for playing Alicia, is a revelation here. She had impressed in previous films, but there's something about her balancing the sweetness of Alicia's personality with her turmoil filled personal life.\n\nI think the main issue with A Beautiful Mind is its pace. At 138 minutes, it's right about at the length of your usual bio-drama, but it doesn't feel like it. The film moves at a really slow pace, especially before we realize what Nash is going through mentally. Part of the reason for this is that I found it hard to approach the complexities of his work. The story is interesting, but I can't say I knew exactly what was going on half the time. If the film would have found a way to make all the equations and theories dumbed down for the general audience, the film would have felt much smoother.\n\nOverall, the film is well done. I love James Horner's score, Roger Deakin's cinematography is beautiful, as is the romance between Connelly and Crowe, but I think it lacks in re-watchability and pacing.\n\n+Romance\n\n+Score\n\n+Strong performances\n\n+Extraordinary story\n\n-But difficult to follow at times\n\n8.5/10",

The film sees Russell Crowe at his best, trying to get under the skill of brilliant but troubled Nobel Prize winner John Nash. Crowe truly inhabits the role, nailing the movements, looks and speech patterns of a person under the constant strain of trying to understand the most basic of human behaviours and interactions, analysing them rather than simply feeling them. It has plenty of great moments, some interesting insights into mental illness, and is often quite moving. Its most resounding drawback is just how sanitised it is. The real Nash was far less pleasant than the one that's presented, but in an obvious attempt to appeal to the masses the film-makers have played it safe, and as a result much of it sticks too close to formula and convention, which is most painfully obvious at its very traditional climax. I would love to have seen a more honest biopic, one that didn't feel the need to gloss over so many of the negatives. What we have instead is still entertaining and genuinely touching, it's just a shame that it failed to be so much more.",

That's enough to make anyone paranoid. Imagine winning the most prestigious prize in the world for a subject you know absolutely nothing about, and still having to smile. It's like David Attenborough admitting he hates those \"dumb animals\". Or Stephen Spielberg denying the holocaust.\n\nDirected by Richie Cunningham from 'Happy Days', aka Ron Howard, and starring Russell Crowe, the movie is set in Harvard University and John Nash's garage out back which is plastered with newspaper clippings and numbers circled and highlighted for their apparent significance in some underworld plot against society only he can work out. I know, you 'know the feeling'. But that's not only why I loved this movie.\n\nLet's face it, true genius is fascinating. It has to be. Because we just don't get it. It would obviously take a genius to get it. So we're like searchers in the dark, neanderthals at their feet, worshippers of the Cigarette-lighter God.\n\nThis movie grabs you by the lapels and draws you in like a ghost through the screen. It doesn't ask if you want to watch me, it makes you watch, like you haven't got a choice or something.\n\nIt has the typical all good-suddenly all weird-worse, worse, worse-finally at the very last minute all good- plot structure. Which I like. Who doesn't? (Except them!)\n\nI guess the thing that I liked most was that this movie made me really care about this guy, John Nash. I didn't want him to get hurt, I didn't want him to suffer and I wanted him to win in the end. Like I don't want to get hurt myself, like I don't want to suffer and like I really want to win in the end. Who doesn't? Life is so painful sometimes it does hurt. I am having a lousy day today. My secretary has just quit and the owner of the school has told me he doesn't want to replace her because it's too expensive and maybe Valerie, the Head of English, can type any letters I need. I am serious, that is my day today. I am so upset and paranoid about why she left and why the owner is doing this to me, I am writing this review. I am certain the owner is trying to get at me, personally. And John Nash is just as certain that communists are plotting to take over the world and the CIA know it and are doing nothing, and we're both Geniuses!\nJohn Nash finally reaches the realisation that it is all in his imagination, but listen to me John, it isn't!  IT is real, the owner does hate me, and if this wasn't the only job in the whole world I could get at my age I wouldn't still be doing it.\n\nYou see, I can relate to John Nash. Anyone who's half-crazy can, and I think that means everyone, except the owner of my school who is TOTALLY crazy.\nWhen he, or you, or I, wins the Nobel at the end you, or I, might shed a tear because you, or I, did it, we overcame the odds, we won. Isn't that our American dream? And it doesn't get any better than that.\n\n- See more at: http://www.principalegg.com/reviews/review-of-the-top-10-most-paranoid-movies-of-all-time/#sthash.an2cdopN.dpuf",

            "content": "John Forbes Nash is an American mathematician and a Nobel Memorial Prize winner. His equations are used in economics, computing, evolutionary biology, politics, accounting, artificial intelligence, and military strategies. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a young man. \"A Beautiful Mind\" is an official biopic of his life. It is directed by Ron Howard and stars Russell Crowe, Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, and Christopher Plummer.\n\nThe biopic follows the life of John Nash (Crowe). He arrives at Princeton University to study math and science. Nash is a very unpleasant, rude, and prideful young man. He tends to rub people the wrong way. However, he and his roommate Charles Herman (Bettany), seem to get along just fine. Nash's objective is to publish his own original idea. He eventually does this, and some years later, finds himself called to the Pentagon to crack a code. While teaching, he meets a young women named Alicia Larde (Connelly). They fall in love and are soon married. Around this time, Nash is confronted by William Parcher (Harris), a member of the United States Department of Defense. Parcher gives him code breaking assignments, and Nash soon begins to cover his office walls with papers, pictures, and yarn to connect the dots. He is oblivious to the fact that he is a paranoid schizophrenic, and soon must face the harsh reality that his illness is having a negative effect on his family.\n\nRussell Crowe is an extraordinary actor. He has been one of my favorites for a long while. His performance in this film is quite good. It may be one of his best in his career. He plays the bright young man at Princeton very well, and the paranoid side also very well. It was like watching someone become a character. I didn't see Russell Crowe, I saw John Nash. This film is full of great talent, including Ed Harris-despite his brief role-who is very good in the movie. Paul Bettany-an actor I can never get enough of-is fantastic in his role as well. However, Crowe steals the show, and is one of the best aspects of this film.\n\n Ron Howard is a very good director, and he directs this film very well. Akiva Goldsman did a brilliant job with the screenplay as well. The dialogue and characters felt very real and natural. I felt as if I got to know each character in the film. They felt like actual people, and not just actors and actresses reading lines. I must also note that the cinematography is absolutely beautiful, thanks to the master of cinematography, Roger Deakins. Each shot was well lit, well framed, and gorgeous to look at. From direction, writing, camera work, to production design, this film impresses.\n\nDespite all of this praise, I must point some things out. The film has been criticized-and praised-on a number of things. When you make a biopic, it's hard to stay true to every single detail of the story. In this case, there were a number of changes and omissions left out of the film. For example, Nash did some things early in his life that were questionable. He left his first wife after she had his first child, and did other reprehensible things. He was also responsible for many of the great mathematical and economical breakthroughs of the nineteenth and early twentieth century.\n\n\"A Beautiful Mind\" is a well acted, well written, and superbly directed film. It's full of emotion and at its core is a beautiful story. Despite these things, it's also too long, and is somewhat untrue to the real story. I will say this, the imagery used to show what was going on in his mind was really creative and it worked well.",

Nash never attends his classes because he´s looking for a creative and original idea to publish and eventually he does publish a new concept of government dynamics, which get him a top secret job for the USA government in order to stop the Soviets.\nBeing a biopic and the big winner of the 2002 Academy Awards, I expected an over the top and fictitious drama about an important person (which honestly, I didn't know who he was before watching this film) but \"A Beautiful Mind\" managed to surprise me by being much more than the typical over sentimental and dramatic film that the Academy loves. \"A Beautiful Mind\" counts with phenomenal and fun to watch acting by every single actor on screen but the three that stand out are the charismatic Paul Bettany, Russell Crowe giving one of the his best performances and Jennifer Connelly in her best performance to date and the one that makes this film; it also counts with beautiful cinematography, a memorable score, effective writing, great dialog, Howard´s direction works perfectly with the script given, a sympathetic protagonist, well done character relationships,  it makes you cheer at the end without using cheap tricks and it counts with a \"twist\" (not a shocker if you know about the life of John Nash) which is both effective and credible thanks to the amazing acting. \n\"A Beautiful Mind\" is a beautiful film thanks to the writing and the acting; sure it invents various elements to John Nash´s life but for the sake of creating an engaging story that deserves every Academy Award it won.",

            "content": "A Beautiful Mind is the true story of the real life genius John F. Nash, Jr. It is a story telling about how John Nash played by Russell Crowe, battled with an unexpected disorder. Under the direction of Ron Howard, the movie took home awards such as Best Director, Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. In A Beautiful Mind John Nash is accepted into Princeton University on the ticket of the Princeton's Most Prestigious. He is not concerned with social ties or even going to class. He is only concerned with finding his original idea. The mathematician stopped at nothing to discover his original idea. One day while in the bar with some classmates he has a ground breaking discovery which is his original idea. A Beautiful Mind has been described as ''A Beautiful Mystery'' by George F. Will from Newsweek. A Beautiful Mind is simply the amazing life story of a man who triumphed over his struggle with common disorder. By far, one of the most inspirational movie made in 2001. \n\tA Beautiful Mind stars John Nash as he goes through his seemingly normal college life. He has classmates, professors, and what he thinks is a roommate. His roommate, Charles Herman (Paul Bettany) becomes his best friend throughout college and though mid-life. He is so overly concerned with finding an original idea that is does not concern himself with anything else. Once he finds his original idea, he becomes a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He finds his, now, wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) taking his class. She is an intelligent, straight forward student. He is then approached with a ''project'' from the Pentagon and matched with a government agent, William Parcher (Ed Harris). From there he is threatened to not tell anyone of his services with the secret service. His entire life is threatened by this job once he decides that he does not wish to work with them anymore. His wife Alicia notices that he is acting strange and decides to do some investigating. She finds that he has been decoding newspapers, magazines, and advertisements. She then calls for someone to help her husband. John Nash is at Princeton University presenting his original idea to some students, when he has an overcoming feeling of William Parcher and his associates are following and waiting to capture him. He then begins to run out of the auditorium during his presentation only to be captured by people from the Mental Rehabilitation Center. Alicia finds out the source of his strange actions and John Nash is hit with the hard reality that his roommate does not exist and he has never worked with William Parcher nor does he even exist. He then struggles to grip onto reality.\nA Beautiful Mind took place in Princeton University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Most of the scenes are shot at Princeton. The special effects were slight but they were there. At one point in the movie there were pigeons on the ground where Charles's niece, Marcee (Vivien Cardone), is playing and the pigeons never move from where the girl is.  The director kept the movie suspenseful at all times. The audience is just as stunned at the results that Alicia and John Nash receive. Everything seemed so real. In a scene in the movie, John Nash becomes over stressed and begins to bang his head on the window when his roommate tries to stop him then the get into a scuffle. The scuffle prompts Charles to push John's desk out the window and onto the ground. No one would have guessed that Charles did not exist. The music in the movie heightened the suspense. The actors and actresses acted their rolls as if they were connected to the true story.\nA Beautiful Mind is a must see movie. It is definitely a five out of five star rating. From the suspense to the shocking plot twist, it keeps the audience's attention. Throughout the movie there were so many hints. There is no question as to why the movie got the awards that it did. The actors and director worked closely with John Nash himself to ensure the movie portrayed his life correctly. A Beautiful Mind is simply a beautiful story. The inspiration and determination in the movie makes the audience feel that they can conquer any obstacle in their life no matter the size.",

Now I think that there portrayal of John Nash waz very good tho. Now I feel that the best thing of the movie waz how they showed the mental disorder \"schizophrenia\". The way his wife also put up with it must have taken a great deal of patients. Knowing that ur there r things in the room u can't see but ur husband can. And also the way he waz able to come up with this all on his own must have been crazy after he found out that he waz a fruit loop.

What other reason is there to cast a 37 year old from New Zealand as a college student from West Virginia? I kept thinking that Michael C. Hall would have been better, but Crowe is okay overall, except for the terrible accent. The movie does have a great score, and Ron Howard's direction is very good. Another positive aspect was that the movie hardly focused on his mathematical achievements, instead it was about the consequences of Nash going along with the hallucinations and Parcher, which was much more interesting. Harris and Connelly give good performances as well. So I guess this movie did have a lot of good things, but it just wasn't good enough to deserve it's Best Picture, especially when that year had The Fellowship of the Ring. Except for Russell Crowe, I thought this was a very well made movie in general. 7/10",

Whilst the film may not stay entirely truthful to the biography that it's based on, it offers a touching insight into mental illness. Based on a true story, A Beautiful Mind is about a mathematical genuis, John Nash, who is battling with schizophrenia. John has both positive and distressing hallucinations. His more positive hallucinations include friendly and charming roomate Charles Herman (Paul Bettany) and his niece Marcee, whilst his more distressing hallucinations include working for the government to decipher codes. John believes that he is being followed and that the Russians are onto him. His boss, William Parcher (Ed Harris), who is also a figment of his imagination, blackmails him into continuing his job despite being under threat. John's schizophrenia begins to severely affect his relationship with his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly).\r\n\r\nA Beautiful Mind is such a sad and powerful film. It epitomises the impact that mental illness can have on a family. John's illness puts both him and his wife in danger, for example when John nearly drowns his son as he believes that Charles is watching the baby. John is hospitalized for his schizophrenia and put on medication, but the medication leaves him feeling lifeless, lethargic and impotent so he refuses to take it and he begins to relapse. He begins to have more public outbursts at the university in which he works in. The film is heartbreaking to watch and it really makes you feel so much for John. It can be so difficult to recover from a mental illness, if ever. I suffer from mental illness myself and it's so hard to get better an it never fully goes away. John learns to live with his schizophrenia over time by ignoring his hallucinations. I liked that the film made John's hallucinations real for the audience as it helped to depict what the mind of a schizophrenic is like and how real these hallucinations are.\r\n\r\nThe film had some really strong performances from the rest of the cast including Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany, Ed Harris, Josh Lucas and Christopher Plummer. A Beautiful Mind is also a love story in a way as it focuses on the relationship between John and his wife Alicia who stands by him. Jennifer Connelly is phenomenal and really the best I've seen her. The only thing I didn't like about the film was that it was misleading about true events that occured in John Nash's life such as how his hallucinations started. In the film, John's hallucinations start at grad school whilst in reality they started later. In real life John and Alicia divorced, but remarried several years later. The film does not portray this. According to film makers it was not meant to be a literal representation.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful film and it made me want to blub, I'm not much of a crier but this really moved me. I highly recommend this film. Russell Crowe is really outstanding; I haven't seen many of his films but I really want to see other films that he's been in.\r\n\r\nGrade: A",

Nash is next seen decoding words in magazines and newspapers as an exercise for the enigmatic stranger who has seemingly entrusted him with national security. But somewhere amid Nash's pursuit of covert operations, we see the unraveling of his mind. By this point, his life unfolds, the truth is revealed, his wife (Jennifer Connelly) attempts to get him help - and stands by him, which is admirable. Nash is seen descending into a world of madness, the product of his mental illness. Unfortunately, the latter part of the film was simply too ludicrous to believe. Nash surrenders to a hallucinogenic world that dissolves into an all-too-stereotypical view of schizophrenic patients. The film seemed to be divided, in my view, into two halves: the first half was engrossing, fascinating, and piqued one's curiosity of a man losing his mind to schizophrenia; the second half simply unraveled like a ball of yarn, ambling along at an inane... and dare I say... almost boring snail's pace.

            "content": "Russell Crowe is not a good actor. Sorry, it just had to be said. He gives incredibly flat delivery, poor diction, and just has absolutely no screen charisma. So it's a shame that his bad acting skills had to besmirch the epic story of John Nash, one of the most celebrated mathematical and economic thinkers of the 20th century. Crowe plays Nash from young to old, beginning with his time in college when he thought up a new way of seeing the free market and how greed for both the individual and the group is important if success is to be attained. This is an intriguing part of the story, but it is utterly ruined when the film piles on layer upon layer of confusing and lame subplots that all turn out to be a figment of Nash's imagination.\r\n\r\nNash had paranoid schizophrenia, and instead of actually showing this, the movie allows the audience to be taken in by ludicrous hallucinations that any viewer with their wits about them will know immediately are false. It's not like this guy is actually cracking codes for the US government. Crowe doesn't help, as the only part of his schtick that he bothers to contribute here is his dumb confused face. Not many of the characters are likable, and the only one we actually care about is one of the hallucinations. It also features one of the most mind-blowingly stupid lines of dialogue ever, when the characters are talking about a painting: \"God must be a painter. Why else would we have so many colors?\" Sometimes there are lines that are so bad, they lower the overall score for the movie a whole point. This would qualify as one of those lines.\r\n\r\nFinal Score for A Beautiful Mind: 5/10 stars. It tells a worthy story, but haphazard storytelling and remarkably indifferent acting make it a pretty unenjoyable affair. Some skilled director (I'm thinking David Fincher) needs to remake this movie with a talented actor in the lead, as well as a scriptwriter who actually knows what they're doing. But until then, the family of John Nash should be a little insulted that this is the best that Hollywood could do with this story.",

A Beautiful Mind receives exceptional direction from Ron Howard which delves into the mind of John Nash and brings the theme of his schizophrenia to the surface in an exceptional manner. A Beautiful Mind depicts schizophrenia in such a manner that it's impeccably convincing to be real, and even when we're completely aware that what we see is actually John Nash's hallucinations, the atmosphere of A Beautiful Mind is so intense and shocking that we feel the brutal hardships of schizophrenia by being sucked into the story and the atmosphere. It's truly an impeccable depiction of schizophrenia and the finest to have been on film ever in history, so an Academy Award for Best Picture is truly in order and deserving.\nIt depicts schizophrenia well, but it also shows other cognitive abilities of John Nash's mind creatively such as his ability to decipher encryptions and how he picks up on notable thing a of everyday life through mathematical mind functioning. The visual style of A Beautiful Mind is absolutely immaculate and gives it the necessary mindset atmosphere.\nIt's premise is also enhanced by a fine script which gives the characters the sophistication required for them to be perceived as the serious figures they really are, and it elevates the story beyond mere melodrama that it could have sunk to had the script not have been this clever. \nEssentially, A Beautiful Mind is, amongst many things, a technical achievement. It has all the strong cinematography and film editing which provides it with memorable imagery and insight into the characters and intentions, and a great musical score to enhance its atmosphere.\nAnd the performances of the actors is what really leads the story.\nRussell Crowe is, for better or for worse, at his finest in A Beautiful Mind. As he isn't portraying a tough guy or aggressive specimen, we for once see Russell Crowe portraying a fragile and humane character, one unlike the person the media portrays him as. He breaks down the facade of being a man of steel, and makes himself human, a human deeper than one he has ever portrayed and deeper than many actors could dream of doing. He unravels all the layers of John Nash deep down until he reaches his fears and anxieties, and how he acts in a schizophrenic state of mind which his absolutely impeccable. A Beautiful Mind is great because of how Russell Crowe depicts John Nash's mind as the beautiful mind that it really is, and his performance is absolutely incredible. It's impossible not to sympathise with John Nash in A Beautiful Mind, and Russell Crowe's performance goes so deep that it gives viewers insight into what schizophrenia does to a person, and prevents them from judging John Nash on the basis of his mental illness.\nJennifer Connelly is at her career peak in A Beautiful Mind, because the material she's working with is top notch stuff, and she proves that she is capable of not only working with such material, but of exceeding it as an actress. Her supporting performance is impeccable and extremely strong in her ability to articulate her character's emotions and deal with such a complex character, as well as dealing with one that's ten times more complex in the leading role which is benefitted by her fine chemistry with Russell Crowe, making it a powerful screen prescience that she holds with tenacity in her fine performance.\nPaul Bettany and Ed Harris also provide good supporting roles, as do Christopher Plummer and Judd Hirsch.\n\nSo A Beautiful Mind is an incredible in-depth depiction of schizophrenia which is flawlessly directed, written and acted.",

However, as times passes it becomes clear that Nash's perception of reality is misguided to say the least, leading to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Can he succeed  whilst battling such an illness?\n\nApparently based on a true story and the life of John Nash Jr. when watching A Beautiful Mind you can't help but feel as though you're not watching a biopic but some Hollywood spectacle. If this were a work of fiction, it would be one of the top pieces of storytelling. Furthermore, many aspects of Nash's life are missing from this so-called biopic, such as his divorce and his bisexuality; two major incidents that I'm sure would effect anybodies life, let alone a schizophrenics.\n\nHowever, this is not to say that there aren't good things in this film. The general acting is very strong with Crowe leading the way with his stunning performance as the schizophrenic Nash, earning him a third straight Oscar nomination. The supporting cast are also in good form especially Paul Bettany as schizophrenic delusion Charles Herman. Furthermore, Jennifer Connelly gives a strong performance as Nash's long-suffering wife, a performance which won her the Oscar in a supporting role.\n\nA very simple drama that does thrill. At times A Beautiful Mind is very entertaining but nothing like the biopic it presents itself to be. Russell Crowe is the films strong point.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n6.5/10.",

Still, the film remains an accomplishment as a whole.\n       Russell Crowe is magnificent as Nash. It is amazing to see Crowe revert from being the star of Gladiator one year into this role the next. And now he's singing in Les Misérables. What a versatile, talented actor.

Crowe was acting at his peak around this time, and his portrayal of the socially awkward nature of Nash as he spiralled towards his illness was superbly done.\n\nBut like so many biopics, it wasn't enough to give the film strong appeal.",

Beautifully played by Russell Crowe and Connelly, this film manages to move and engage you in the story thanks to the screenplay written by Akiva Goldsman and thanks to the soundtrack composed by Horner, beautifully directed by Ron Howard, but what the film is well acted, well- written and well directed, I did not like one thing, the film is based mainly on Nash's schizophrenia, but does not show his discoveries, the film goes forward in time saying that Nash has made the findings, but the findings are not in the movie shown, but only mentioned, I personally would have done even see the discoveries made, but belonging to this small defect is a film absolutely perfect, well acted, well directed and well written, and especially with a beautiful finish that between the title of the tail feels All Love Can Be beautiful song sung by Charlotte Church. Winner of 4 Golden Globe Awards 2002: Best Drama, Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama, Best Supporting Actress and Best Screenplay, and 4 Academy Awards 2002: Best Film, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay.

As life goes on Nash settles down with wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) and manages to get a job. However, as times passes it becomes clear that Nash's perception of reality is misguided to say the least, leading to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Can he succeed  whilst battling such an illness?\n\nApparently based on a true story and the life of John Nash Jr. when watching A Beautiful Mind you can't help but feel as though you're not watching a biopic but some Hollywood spectacle. If this were a work of fiction, it would be one of the top pieces of storytelling. Furthermore, many aspects of Nash's life are missing from this so-called biopic, such as his divorce and his bisexuality; two major incidents that I'm sure would effect anybodies life, let alone a schizophrenics. \n\nHowever, this is not to say that there aren't good things in this film. The general acting is very strong with Crowe leading the way with his stunning performance as the schizophrenic Nash, earning him a third straight Oscar nomination. The supporting cast are also in good form especially Paul Bettany as schizophrenic delusion Charles Herman. Furthermore, Jennifer Connelly gives a strong performance as Nash's long-suffering wife, a performance which won her the Oscar in a supporting role. \n\nA very simple drama that does thrill. At times A Beautiful Mind is very entertaining but nothing like the biopic it presents itself to be. Russell Crowe is the films strong point.\n\nJ.Henderson.\n\n6.5/10.",

            "content": "I know everyone has already said this, but, 'A Beautiful Mind' really is a beautiful film. Within the first minute I was already absorbed into its world and the film would go on to be one of the most compelling and emotionally powerful films that I have ever seen. Ron Howard does an excellent job crafting this very intimate and heartbreaking tale and it's shocking to know that he made this right after making that Grinch movie, but then again, it just goes to show, once again, how varied his films are. I'm not trying to say I went in with low expectations, but this film could have easily been a cliché ridden mess that was very shallow and manipulative to just trick with the audience into getting an emotional reaction out of them. It could have had that scene where the character looks blankly into the sky with sappy music playing in the background and so much more, like another film that did that was released in 2001 where it's lead actor was nominated for an Oscar, but this film never does that as it is very genuine and real. The story is very smart and very well assembled and the filmmakers explained why they chose to do what they did whilst making it. I had no idea what was going to happen and after the first hour I was just so surprised with what happened next. The story also has a surprising amount of twists and turns that are very, very subtle and they add so much to the story and it all goes at an excellent pace that covers so much material.\n\nThe acting in this is perfect by everyone, Jennifer Connelly does an excellent job against Russell Crowe and, like Crowe, she was very nuanced and very powerful. I thought I was going to judge her performance a lot just because she won and Crowe didn't, and the debate of what quantifies Leading and Supporting is brought up once again, but she did do an excellent job and deserved it. Ed Harris and Paul Bettany were great, even though, at first, I wanted to see them in the film more, but I guess we don't really want that, we want them to be in the film as little as possible. Josh Lucas was excellent and had a very welcome amount of depth, in a lesser film like the type I just mentioned, his character, and the ones that hang around him, would have been very 2-dimensional, regardless if it's a biopic or not. And Christopher Plummer is great as usual and stars alongside Russell Crowe once more, in another biopic too. Speaking of Russell Crowe, he gives one of the best performances that has ever been put on film. They began production right after he won for 'Gladiator', and, funnily enough, in his speech  he does a mannerism of John Nash Jr.. He has shown amazing versatility throughout his career and its especially noticeable if one saw 'Gladiator' before this and he completely owns the film and it's an absolute joke that he didn't win, what should have been, his second Oscar. In a film that won the awards it did and it not winning Beat Actor is unbelievable; I know that's happened before but with all Crowe did win, it's just crazy. I've said in the past that talent isn't, or to some people- shouldn't, be judged by awards, but c'mon! When someone puts the effort in and gives one of the best performances in history, it's just laughable he lost, and I'm not saying Denzel was bad, because he wasn't, but Russell Crowe was out of this world. Maybe I missed something and there is more behind his loss, but to win all the other major awards and not Oscar is strange, but it's happened before. However, when you look at who else won that night, it isn't really surprising why they chose who they did, people call it a 'make up' Oscar which isn't fair and the reason why they chose Denzel over Crowe is solidified in Denzel's speech. Connelly probably wouldn't have won either if she was indeed nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role, but hey, who knows, and Robert Redford won an Honorary Oscar as well so maybe I'm full of rubbish. Sorry to sound like a conspiracy nut but when there is a website dedicated to this subject of Crowe's snub, you know that they messed up terribly. This was the final Oscar snub in a series of knock-on effect losses, that came in full effect in 1992 but started long before then, and some would argue that this loss was the most tragic. Doesn't matter though, he got an Oscar for one performance and a BAFTA, Golden Globe and SAG for another and so many other awards, so, in the end, who is the real winner? And 'Shrek' won the first ever Best Animated Feature Oscar, so, hey, I guess it all works out. I'm aware most of this review is me talking about something unrelated to the actual film but I'm sorry, it's just unbelievable and, hey, where else can I talk about this?\n\nHowever, there is very little else I can say about this film because I loved all of it, it does absolutely everything right. Soundtrack; excellent and very inspiring, that uses some slight arrangements that Horner would go on to use in 'All the Kings Men'. Cinematography; beautiful and clever, Roger Deakins did it, so that's to be expected. Editing; smart. Script; heartbreaking and extremely moving. Featuring perfect, sensitive direction and one of the best lead performances by actor that has ever been filmed, it all wraps up into a very moving, inspiring, engaging, heartbreaking, powerful film. It is a film that really deserved the awards it got and it stars Russell Crowe in his 2nd Best Picture win out of 4 nominees in a row and overall, really holds up well. It is another film off of the list and I just absolutely love it, it's perfect from beginning to end. 'A Beautiful Mind' is very simply, one of the best films ever made.",

It's got some lovely performances, but it's not the modern classic people made it out to be, and it somehow would go on to win Best Picture and Best Director at the Oscars that year, still it's not that bad. It begins in 1947, when John Nash (Russell Crowe) arrives at Princeton University to study advanced mathematics, but he has an unorthodox way of doing things, and he won't attend classes. He becomes friends with English student Charles Herman (Paul Bettany). Despite expectations that Nash will fail, he succeeds and gets a job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a few years later, gets to help the Pentagon encrypted enemy telecommunication from the Soviets. He reports to supervisor William Parcher (Ed Harris), who gives him assignments. Meanwhile, Nash falls for student Alicia Larde (Jennifer Connelly), and they marry. But Alicia notices something is not right about Nash going off on these cloak and dagger assignments, something just isn't there. It's well filmed, and Crowe gives a good performance as the tormented Nash, and Howard is always a good director of actors, but it's a shame he won an Oscar for a film that isn't even his best, he should have won it for something like Apollo 13 (1995) or Frost/Nixon (2008), and it is a bit overlong and sentimental.",

With enough characterization and a well rounded cast, director Ron Howard created a strapping tour de force; led by the noble feat of Russell Crowe (Gladiator, The Insider, and L.A Confidential) who managed to define courage and fear from his role as John Nash, a genius whose life turned tragic due to conflicts caused by his schizophrenic misadventures. The journey of Mr. Nash starts with his stay at Princeton for graduate school, it is the time when he developed post-modernistic theories that involves mathematical ciphers, one of those is the world known and valuable theorem about non-cooperative equilibrium. His whereabouts continues when he was invited to the pentagon to encrypt hidden messages from Russia, he also began teaching at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; it is also the time when he met the woman heâ(TM)ll love for the rest of his entire life, with a mindset of the matrimony promise, for better or for worse, till death do them part. Some years later, he developed a bizarre bond with his mind buds, which altered him into a socio-predicament without even realizing it. His clash in this man against himself genre has deliberately controlled an emotional ride from its climax up to the finale. \n\nThis entire ride of a viciously eager fight against the sub-conscious of a personâ(TM)s psyche is relevant to us, to the struggles brought by our daily existence. It is affecting with a tactic that never relies with tear jerk moments, instead, âA Beautiful Mindsâ? used a firm and leisurely paced story to keep us in touch to our television screens for two hours and a half.  From start to finish, I was conferred with an exceptional work of art, an astounding present that Iâ(TM)ll always remember 20 years from now. I can compare his life to an alcoholic beverage (tequila, wine, champagne), it promises gratification and heaven to the person drinking it but even without having much, the next day starts like hell, heâ(TM)ll feel thirsty and exhausted at the same time; just like the life of John Nash, he has been awarded with praise and jurisdiction at the start of his career, but the next decades became a universe of torment, an agony of dread brought by his nemesis, the inner John Nash who lives with the effects of his apprehension; sooner or later, the hangover will vanish, comparing it to Nash, he fought hard and in the end, he prevailed against himself, continuing a better life.",

            "content": "This one I mostly wanted to see because I wanted to know what was it about that film that made it beat Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. I mean I thought it should not have happened, my brother who's the bigger best picture expert then me has seen both and though Lord of the Rings should have won. So with the plan to start focusing more on best picture winners for my reviews, I figured it was about time that I watch the movie and see whether or not I agree or disagree with that choice. So here's my review for A Beautiful Mind.\r\n\r\nPlot: John Nash is co-recipient at Princeton University who has a roommate named Charles who often tries to get him out of his studies. One day he comes up with a brand new idea on Governing Dynamics which leads him to end up having an appointment with MIT. Years later he is hired by the pentagon to crack encrypted enemy communication, but he eventually is sent to a psychiatric facility that he thinks is secretly run by the Soviets despite the fact that the people int he facility and even his wife claim that the whole Soviets communication and even his roommate are not real.\r\n\r\nThis was actually a rather well done movie. The characters were good, the acting was interesting, and the story was more interesting as the movie went on. Now, without saying anything, I thought that what happens during the second half of the film was something of a drag but eventually they made up for it by making the goal for the characters into something that made each of them much enjoyable and also made me care much more for them. Now would I say that it deserved to win Best Picture against Lord of the Rings? In my biased but slightly reasonable opinion, no. But now that I've seen it, I at least know that at least Fellowship lost to an good and respectable movie... unlike some OTHER movies *glares at Out of Africa and Shakespeare in Love*\r\n\r\nActor/Character:\r\nRussell Crowe/John Nash: Surprisingly, He actually did a very commendable with his acting. I mean maybe it's because of the fact that most of the movies I watch with him in is mostly him in action film where he's all serious and kind bad-a an- no wait, that's completely the reason why. But seriously, Crowe was much better with playing a different character, and I enjoyed him much more because he started to become someone I can roughly relate to. How is that so, well I'm going to have to do a spoiler alert on that so if you haven't seen it, go watch it before you read this explanation. *WARNING SPOILERS* Well I mostly relate because, for those of you who don't know, I have High-Functioning Autism, and through a fair portion of my childhood I was roughly similar to John Nash. I didn't have that big of a social life, I was more focused on the stuff I wanted to do, and I had imaginary friends and altogether, an entire world in my mind to daydream about. It wasn't as bad as it was with Nash with thinking that the stuff in my mind was real or anything but in certain aspects, it was roughly the same thing. And also similar to John I was able to eventually grow out of it and started to focus a little more on real things which lead me to make more close friends, have a better social life and I was more able to overcome things with my autism as a whole. Are things perfect? No.  I mean I have yet to do anything close to have a good career and have a wife and kid(s), like John Nash, there's still stuff I have to work on with my autism,  and also like Nash, the memories or ghosts or whatever come back at times, but in the long run we have both managed to eventually overcome the world that we created in our mind for ourselves and eventually focused more on the real world and that why i really like this character. *END OF SPOILERS*\r\n\r\nEditing: I thought it was nicely done, I don't know if I agree with it being nominated for Best Editing for that year as well, but it was still well done.\r\n\r\nAnd that's my review for A Beautiful Mind. While it's not as worthy to win as Fellowship of the Ring, it still gives us a well made movie with a good story and a character I enjoy and can roughly relate to personally.",

            "content": "[b][u]Review My Collection #29[/u][/b]\r\n\r\nWhen the phrase \"Oscar nominated actor\" comes up, Russell Crowe isn't the first name that springs to mind.  But in a three year span from 1999 to 2001, the New Zealand born actor was the most decorated performer in Hollywood.  The Insider gave him his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor, the new millennium saw him win the award for his starring role in Gladiator and one year later, he completed the nomination trifecta with his brilliant portrayal of mathematician John Nash in Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind.  While many critics derided the film for its lack of historical accuracy, the fine acting, excellent script and heart-wrenching story makes it a success on nearly every level.\r\n\r\nThe film centers around the sorta-true life story of mathematician John Nash.  The script follows Nash as he progresses from an eccentric Princeton graduate student searching for an original idea to his work with the government cracking codes.  He's got a girl, a gig and limitless potential.  All seems well in the life of the genius until the world he believes to be true comes crashing down around him.  If I seem hesitant to do a plot synopsis, there's good reason for that.  Much of the film's tension lies in a mid movie reveal that turns the entire story on its head.  Suffice to say, this is a film that must be watched twice if only to capture the little hints and nods to the second act twist.  Much of the film's success lies in its ability to surprise, a rarity in the usual staid biopic genre.\r\n\r\nBut the movie isn't all shocking reveals and plot twists.  The core of the experience lies in the very realistic love story between Nash and his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly).  Taking home a well deserved Best Actress Oscar for the role, Connelly is brilliant as the romantic interest.  Rather than hot passion, Connelly's character serves as Nash's support system through the tough times in his life.  The film is a bit of a brain bender and the choice to soften the experience with a genuine love story is a smart and effective one.\r\n\r\nNaturally, when doing a film of this nature the toughest task goes to the lead.  The line between parody and impersonation is a fine tightrope.  Teeter either way and the film falls apart.  Russell Crowe avoids this by balancing the mannerisms of the real John Nash with some strong character work, allowing him to absolutely disappear in the role.  The Oscar winning makeup certainly helps in creating the illusion but it would just be fancy latex without the great acting by Crowe.  The rest of the cast perfectly complements the principals, including fine work by Paul Bettany as Nash's friend Charles and the always reliable Ed Harris as Department of Defense agent William Parcher.\r\n\r\nThe main detraction most reviewers found with this movie in the large historical inaccuracies between the real life John Nash and the fictitious character.  Remember all that talk about the realistic love story and his Fascism defeating code cracking?  Fictitious.  Biopics generally pride themselves in presenting their subjects in a realistic light, but A Beautiful Mind takes great liberties with the true story of John Nash.  While purists may find these revisions almost offensive, I found the film conveyed the nature of his struggles in a visual and artful way, even if the specifics are largely manufactured.  Think of it as sacrificing accuracy for the greater emotional good.  If you want to learn about the real John Nash, rent the excellent PBS documentary A Beautiful Madness.  \r\n\r\nWhile many of the film's elements were invented to enhance the drama, the drama itself is excellent and well worth a watch.  The movie theater is where I go to get swept away and in that respect, A Beautiful Mind does just that.  Combining a fantastic ensemble cast, some amazing effects and more surprises than one would expect from a \"standard biopic\", Ron Howard's portrait of a burdened genius stirs the soul with a powerful yet hopeful message of triumph in the face of adversity.  Winner of four Academy awards including Best Picture, A Beautiful Mind may not be 100% accurate in its storytelling but it captures the spirit of an inspirational person better than any biopic could ever hope for.\r\n\r\n[url=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/user/808326/blogs/?id=701434\"]**Check out my RT blog entitled \"Review My Collection\" for the rest of the series!!**[/url]",

This movie was directed perfectly (and I MEAN perfectly),the music is both very beautiful and interesting and a million and over kudos to Russell Crowe for his AMAZING performance! I am not exaggerating NO ONE would have been able to do a better job of playing John Nash than Russell Crowe. A different person would have messed up the character completely. But Russell's acting is so good that it seems like he IS John Nash. He deserved his Best Actor award he did an INCREDIBLE job! I would say he's as good playing John Nash as Heath Ledger was playing the Joker if you want some comparisons thrown at ya! Jennifer Connelly's performance was exceptionally good also. She is such a wonderfully gifted dramatic actress and you can see it in this movie. If I could sum up this movie in one word it's impossible...as you can tell lol! 5 and above stars to this movie definitely!",

The movie instead spends literally 30 seconds on what game theory is and then rushes back to scenes of him writing mathematical squiggles on windows and chalk boards. I'm sorry, this is not good enough. The director is so keen to show us a highly fictionalised and lurid account of Nash's descent into schizophrenia that the main reason we care about the guy (he's a mathematical genius, after all) ends up totally forgotten. I wish I'd read the book on which this is based before I saw the film, since many of the imagined scenes are quite ludicrous. Although I concede it's not easy to show what schizophrenia is like, there must have been better ways of describing it that this. We are treated to endless bizarre dreamlike scenes involving Russian spies and Nash's imaginary mysterious spy boss who asks him to carry out ever more maniacal tasks. This all makes for very uncomfortable viewing and worse, it doesn't teach us anything. Nor do we learn why Nash suddenly returned to a state bordering on normality and how he came to be awarded the Nobel Prize. The film omits to mention he fathered a child before he met his wife and doesn't tell us she left him for several years. This is a mess of a film and much less interesting than it could have been.",

Paul Bettany came off a bit one dimensional at first, but the revelation of his character as one of Nash's hallucinations has some intriguing implications.

Ron Howard's direction is solid as always, but really not that award-worthy, especially if you compare it to for example Baz Luhrman's achievement for Moulin Rouge (from the same year, but not even nominated for an Oscar!).\nBut I shouldn't talk about the Oscars: lets judge the film by its own merits.

The cast is outstanding. There was no one bad in this movie. Russell Crowe was superb as John, he played his role with such skill and gave such a powerful performance. Jennifer Connelly was the winner here with her role as Aliesha. She was the most interesting character. This woman who falls in love with her teacher, gets married with him, then to have to deal with his mental problem. There's so much terrific character development and i loved the relationship between John and Aliesha. I did detect some plot holes - but it didn't matter because I just forgot about them as the film went on. Truly is a great epic.",

            "content": "Ron Howard directed this amazing movie that won 4 academy awards including best picture in the year of 2001.  I think that A Beautiful Mind is the best film that he has directed of the ones I have seen.  The film is a true story about a tortured genius named John Nash.  John Nash was a math genius, and a code breaker.  He was absolutely brilliant, and there was no code or pattern that he couldn't crack.  He was tortured because he is a schizophrenic.  He was paranoid until he learned it.  When he learned that he had it he eventually got better, but he never beat it entirely.  He still see's people that aren't there, but he ignores them and he moves on with his life.  The film goes through the story of his life from the years of 1947 - 1994.\r\n\r\nAt first John was kind of a stereotypical genius.  When he spoke he sounded as educated as it gets, and slightly arrogant at times.  He seemed like he thought he was above things at certain points, but that feeling I only had about once or twice.  He is the type of genius that doesn't have many other redeeming qualities other then his brains.  He is not very sociable, outgoing, or even relatable.  It is sad because not many people liked him, and he knew it.  He is fascinating to listen too, and I would love to meet a genius like him, because I am sure it would be a really interesting experience.  His genius was purely mathematical, and that he analyzed the world around him through math and algorithms.  He went to Princeton University in the year of 1947.  People picked on him for being weird, and he clearly was strange.  He never went to class because he thought, \"Classes will dull your mind, destroy the potential for authentic creativity.\"  In his case he was right, and he did better by not going to class.  He would find algorithms for everything, and wrote them on the window of his dorm.  During the time he was at college he would do things like try to figure out how to spend the night with a girl who he met at a bar, but he wasn't any good at it.  He and his friends were always trying to figure out how to get with a girl, but he would always come up with some mathematical solution to it.  Five years later he is working at the Pentagon as an analyst.  He also worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and he had to teach their students to get the facilities that he wanted to work at.  That is how he met his future wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly).  She actually asked him out, and the eventually got married.\r\n\r\nHis illness is something you are oblivious about until you are finally told about it.  Like all dramas it starts off happier then it really gets more serious when the conflict kicks in.  He had a roommate named Charles Herman (Paul Bettany) who was his best friend, that didn't exist.  That roommate he imagines has lots of personality, and eventually a niece named Marcee (Vivien Cardone), who never gets older.  That is how he earns that he doesn't actually see her.  They see each other regularly, but not so much that it isn't abnormal.  So that kind of makes it seem like they just ran into each other.  The big one was the man William Parcher who he imagined that he worked for.  William Parcher (Ed Harris) wanted him to help him decipher codes to a bomb that terrorists were going to detonate in America.  However Parcher was just a part of his imagination, and ash spent a ton of time deciphering codes in newspapers and magazines that didn't make sense.  The people he was imagining started to put him in danger, and he became really paranoid.\r\n\r\nHe was put in the hospital, where he got a lot of help.  When he got out he eventually started to see them again, and he put his baby in danger thinking that his old roommate who didn't exist was watching him.  Parcher came back and started to tell him about his work and he basically just relapsed.  He eventually realized that he was never going to beat it, so he decided just to ignore the three people who would always see, and he lived his life that way.  He and his wife are still alive today, and he still lives with his illness.  He will have to ask if a person is really there or not.  Once he learned of his illness that allowed him to get much better.\r\n\r\nRussell Crowe did a phenomenal job portraying John Nash.  He starred in the bets picture of the year two years in a row.  Gladiator in 2000, and A Beautiful mind in 2001.  He is a great actor, with an ability to play a wide range of roles, but this was his best role.  Jennifer Connelly was also really good.  Her acting was hard to do at times, because it got really emotional at times.  This was overall a fantastic movie with great acting, directing, and a really inspiring story.  One of my favorites for sure, that is one of the rare films that I intend to watch again.  I loved every minute of it.",

There's not much to be said of it really.\r\n\r\nThe story is excellent, spanning over a period of many years in the life of mentally ill, John Nash, played by Russell Crowe. The plot with the reality and hallucination sequences was extremely affective, and well done. Also, powerful and touching.\r\n\r\nThe acting is fantastic, both leading and supporting roles alike. Supporting actors Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Judd Hirsch, and Josh Lucas really give strong performances. Russell Crowe received an Oscar nomination...he gives a great performance, but it was the beautiful and stunning Jennifer Connelly who makes this film. Her performance as Nash's wife, Alicia, is brilliant...one of my favorite supporting performances. She's one of my favorite actresses. She definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\r\n\r\nExcellent musical score by James Horner!\r\n\r\nI think one of the things I liked most about the film is the emotion. Parts of the story are so sad, tragic even. I really felt for the characters and that made all the difference. There are some powerful and emotional scenes in this film.\r\n\r\nEven though this film \"stole\" Best Picture from LotR: The Fellowship of Ring, this is still an excellent, near perfect film. Ron Howard brilliantly directed this movie, and it will most likely remain his very best. Everything about it is excellent...I love this film! I completely recommend this!",

However, as a film about the life of a mentally-ill genius, it is interesting in its portrayal of relationships, hubris, and change, but not necessarily in its depiction of mental-illness itself, which it likely portrays highly inaccurately. The film's strength is that it covers such a long period in this made-up Nash's life that it is able to show his relationship with himself and others change, which is insightful and interesting to watch. For example, A Beautiful Mind shows us that Nash is accepted only late in his life, when the people around him change and notice him through his work and not through his famed antics, which is an interesting observation. I'll also admit to completely being taken in by the film's nostalgia (and piling on much more nostalgia as well) and infectious somber atmosphere, but really these are some of the gaping flaws in this film, whose sentimentalism makes for a wondrous tale, but detracts from realism and prevents it from being a realistic tale about any mentally-ill genius, let alone a biographical tale about The John Nash.",

Although the film did omit some important things out of Nasar's book, it did not take away from it as much as I thought it would.",

He is aided by his roommate (Paul Bettany), who is imaginary, in developing his legacy. Nash eventually works his way to being a professor at Princeton and developing a relationship with an attractive woman (Jennifer Connelly). Sadly, his imaginary friend, now along with a little girl and an out-of-control sergeant, envelop his life, for which he behaves strangely and erratically and thinks he is being hunted down by the CIA for knowing too much. It drives him and his wife nuts. Surprisingly compelling and believable story of a man stuck in schizophrenia. Crowe and Connelly are really good in their performances and it works as an emotionally uplifting story. Not overlong, surprisingly, and doesn't really look down towards those who suffer the unfortunate disorder. Very good film!",

This was especially so with respect to Russell Crowe's role as John Forbes Nash.

For instance, in reality, Nash didn't see see non-existent secret agents or a little girl: he just heard imaginary voices. However, paraphrasing the real Nash's own words, to depict only voices onscreen wouldn't have been dramatically convincing. Conjuring visions of imaginary people onscreen was, to the real Nash, an effective way of displaying the inner madness that was imprinted on his psyche throughout his career. He remains one of my most inspirational figures, and needless to say, Ron Howard made a beautiful biopic of his life in this. With one weakness, however - I felt that it was rather too long and drab, and at points, things even got a bit confusing (in an unnecessary way). Having said that, this was a very worthy biopic, and with that haunting James Horner score, it got even more inspiring and uplifting to watch.",

            "content": "Looking at the details of the DVD info, it had a few words for the film A Beautiful Mind because it wants to have us watch and enter to this delicate film.\r\n\r\nOne of the themes the film deals with is mental illness as the character is diagnosed, but we don't know that until we see the film. Sorry for the spoiler, you did not know that, but anywhere you look will have tell you what the film deals with.\r\n\r\nA Beautiful Mind is the first I seen where schizophrenia was used correctly in terms of identification. The film is tagged based on a true story, so it will up the chances of someone believing although; one can question the adaptation over the film and John Nash. A number of shows and movies often get the characteristics of schizophrenia wrong like Me, Myself, & Irene. Schizophrenia means split mind, and it is widely believed that it means more than one personality. Wrong. It is classified as a mental disturbance that affect common life including social, thinking, emotions, and reality. Russell Crowe's character, John Nash, is a very smart man and very delicate except when it comes to the ladies in the bar. He attends the University of Princeton where he studies and concentrates a couple of theories. He is on the verge of success and accomplishing great things until he nearly loses it all. \r\n\r\nWe open up with Nash in Princeton University as comes off normal with a few oddities. When reading the newspapers, words and numbers begin to fly out and connect with each other leading John to start puzzling and connecting the dots. John surrounds himself with newspapers and linking the article believing there is a secret code. He does not find it odd, but believe he is special or gifted. In reality, nothing is encoded and a regular person would have though he is crazy or on drugs. I would have personally played along; trying to see what is his major malfunction.\r\n \r\nThroughout the first part of the movie, we see through John's view. He's a normal man with a gifted mind with math. His theories are very amazing and later become prolifically. You (audience and readers) can tell that he is not social especially when he uses one of the greatest pickup lines of all time, \"exchange fluids?\" The only thing I was fishy about was his friend and roommate Charles. Out of all the people, Charles is a person that John can talk to him without the awkwardness contrasting his personality in public. However, I did let my guard down as the story takes an awkward turn when John is chosen to help the Pentagon from Department of Defense. I still thought it was normal. There he meets William Parcher (William Harris) one of the agents of Department of Defense. His task is to find and decode the messages subliminally implanted in newspapers, whatever. The film switches to what is happening in real life and we are shocked. His wife investigates and sees another perspective to what has been really happening. The revelations are strong and too real. \r\n\r\nThough manipulated, we cannot wonder how this came about, but understand a fraction world of John Nash is in. No, I do not believe the film could be used as a prime example and saying, oh yeah, I know what schizophrenia is like! The screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and director Ron Howard try to capture and bring back the visual wonderful world of schizophrenia although it could be off depending who you ask. We feel for the character and grow with them as we believe that everything is true. Suddenly, his voices paranoia kicks when incidents involving Russians. We follow the character to survive in possible way as we rely on him because we are observing his point of view. We come to terms at the start of the revelations. We learn about schizophrenia through the doctors. I will leave it that with plot. \r\n\r\nA Beautiful Mind accomplishes a lot as we are given a great picture. The acting is really great allowing us to enter and feel the characters as we move. Mr. Crowe was excellent in the portrayal of Nash even though we don't really know how he is. We should be careful when using films portrayals of a real life person: movie's version vs. actual personality. Jennifer Connelly does a wonderful job as Alicia Nash, John's wife. Ed Harris was really intimidating the agent of Dept. of Defense. Everybody else was great thanks to the well written script and Ron Howard's direction. Also, I must mention the production was very well and soundtrack was terrific. I believe we will never enter the world of schizophrenia and know it through the eyes of those, but a film like this will have us understand in a level.",

But it turns out that Nash is actually suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, and has been doing so for years. Even his best friend/ex-roommate, Charles, is nothing more than a creation of his imagination. Nash's gorgeous and devoted wife, Alicia, shows the true meaning of the marriage vow line \"in sickness and in health\". Frustrated and afraid, she still loves and sticks by her husband through his tumultuous mental issues and is the reason Nash really becomes who he becomes.\r\n\r\nThe acting is pretty superb. Jennifer Connelly is believable as Alicia, but I do have a hard time seeing how she'd find a guy like John Nash attractive enough to ask him out. He's smug, dismissive of others, and unkempt-- his fingernails are creepily long. John Nash is socially inept, odd, and amazingly arrogant about his own abilities but Russell Crowe actually manages to make that twitchiness a mildly endearing attribute. Endearing enough to make you root for Nash's recovery and success, and actually begin to hate the figments of his imagination (Charles, Parcher, even little Marcee) that threaten to bring him down.\r\n\r\n\"A Beautiful Mind\" is both funny and sad, and an intriguing story of the willpower of one man to overcome his debilitating mental illness to become a renowned Nobel Prize winner.",

Of the three examples, Dustin Hoffman would be the only one who truly deserved an Oscar for his performance.  His performance was made iconic by not only his perseverance, but the endless number of quotes and scenes that remain in our minds.  Russell Crowe would be near the bottom of the barrel for his performance as John Nash.  Not once did he say or do anything that would stick with us forever, nor did he deliver an overly convincing performance.  The ones who held the film up from becoming a dull debacle were Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris.\n\nA BEAUTIFUL MIND was a huge disappointment.  For me, it goes with MILLION DOLLAR BABY, TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, and DANCES WITH WOLVES as films that should have under no circumstance won Best Picture.

Also spectacular in the film was Oscar for Best Supporting Actress winner Jennifer Connelly who plays Crowe's wife. Paul Bettany, Ed Harris, and Josh Lucas were also great in supporting roles. Ron Howard won Best Director, though he wasn't even nominated for the award in 1995 for his Best Picture-deserving Apollo 13.

Either I'm going crazy too or my creative juices have taken a blow because of how effective the psychological impact is. Of course, the concept alone isn't going to deliver a hard enough psychological blow. Credit goes out to Ron Howard and Russell Crowe, but more on them later.\r\n\r\nAs good as the film is, it does suffer from a moderate lack of immediate development and a bit of a bumpy transition from the lengthy development segment. In spite of these small complaints, the film still features good dialogue, fine visual effects, very good make-up when aging comes into play, charming character chemistry and boasts a compelling story, strong characters, an exhilarating score, a solid twist, fantastic acting and very effective emotional and psychological impact. But what makes the impacts of this film so effective? Why, it's director Ron Howard, who once again brings his trademark grittiness to the film, which works to great effect when he brilliantly transports us into Crowe's character John Nash's situation and has us feeling his struggles - certainly not to an authentic extent - but still genuinely enough for us to feel his pain. Man, Ron could have us feel the pain of a mental patient and now he can't even make \"The Da Vinci Code\" complex. Maybe he's slipping into madness too. Did you really think I was going to review a great Ron Howard movie without complaining about one of his very few bad movies that he did years later?\r\n\r\nBut seriously though, as fantastic as Howard's direction is, he still can't pull off the film's emotional influence alone. Equal, if not more credit goes to leading man Russell Crowe for being the key ingredient to the film's immerseiveness. Crowe's smaller accomplishments in the performance - such as a likeable charisma and solid accent and mannerism changes - are impressive. His much grander accomplishments of emoting and giving off the genuine atmosphere of his character in order to complete Howard's emotional and psychological influence is downright beyond awe-inspiring. Really, I don't exactly know how to break down Crowe's - dare I say it - masterful performance. Perhaps the best word to fully convey the quality of Crowe's performance in this film is \"transformation\". He dives as deeply as ever into his role and masterfully transforms into his character, with the only evidence of his being, well, Russell Crowe being his distincitve appearance, voice and name for the book of acting legends in the credits.\r\n\r\nUltimately, \"A Beautiful Mind\", led by Ron Howard's incredible direction and Russell Crowe's show-stoppingly masterful performance - oh, I mean transformation, stands ever-so tall as a powerful and deeply moving retelling of the great John Nash's brilliance and struggles, as well as a fascinating study on the complexities of the human mind.",

I cant praise Russel Crowe enough every performance he gives is absolutely golden. Jennifer Connelly with a grace and beauty is able to hold her own with Russel Crowe in the very intense dramatic scenes with ease, the oscar was very well deserved. Christopher Plummer is just one of the all time greatest everything he touches much like Crowe turns to gold. Paul Bettany who is one of the most under appreciated actors of his time delivers a somewhat haunting performance.

He is able to do so, with the help of his roommate Charles. Despite social awkwardness and whatnot, he wins the heart of a lady and gets a job in cryptology for the Department of Defense. However, his situation escalates into a downward spiral due to suffering from schizophrenia. Since it's a true story, I leave the rest for you to fill out.\nA Beautiful Mind is, well, beautiful (not just to look at but also in spirit). It's also benefited by a sheer amount of sensitivity and thoughtfulness, Ron Howard's fine direction, and a talented supporting cast. Surprisingly, for a dramatic/inspirational picture, this film also has its suspenseful moments, many of which involve John's hallucinations. The score is also fascinating and the imagery is poetic. Also present is an excellent story within an excellent script that knows what it's doing. It's involving, with a few unexpected twists.\nHowever, a twist did borrow from \"Fight Club\"... and some of the events are supposedly not true. But, it's not meant to be a literal representation of Nash and schizophrenia, as the filmmakers have stated. The real John Nash liked it, so there should be no problem. However, the beginning was kinda slow as well as a bit towards the end.\nThis movie went on to win four Academy Awards (even Best Picture), and it deserved all of them. This means that LOTR fans should be quiet. Not only one of the better Best Picture winners, but also an amazing, wonderful flick which reminds you that any obstacle (even mental ones) can be overcome and that anything is possible.",

Everyone is haunted by their past. \r\n\r\nNash: I've gotten used to ignoring them and I think, as a result, they've kind of given up on me.

I just choose not to acknowledge them. Like a diet of the mind, I just choose not to indulge certain appetites; like my appetite for patterns; perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream. \r\n\r\nThe bonus materials were also quite good.  seeing the real John Nash teaching in the classroom and receiving his Nobel Prize added to my appreciation of the story.",

He falls in love with a beautiful woman (Alicia Nash), but things go bad when a man in black (Ed Harris) offers him s job as a spy, and he needs to research the Russians.  But when a weird turn of events start happening, the problem we thought about John Nash is greater than anything us or him couldve imagined.  Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly  were incredible, genius acting from both, and Connelly deserved the Oscar.  The plot was a better version of the real story, and I think it turns John Nash's story into one of the most incredible brain twisters ever made.

Early in the film, Nash begins developing paranoid schizophrenia and endures delusional episodes while painfully watching the loss and burden his condition brings on his wife and friends.\r\n\r\nI love life stories, I also heavily adore physiological movies, this technically is more of a biopic though.\r\n\r\nI find the only downside to movies like this is, sometimes you think the climax has arrived and you think the film is done, then another ten minutes go by, something else extraordinary happens, and you're left waiting when his life is done? not because you want it to end, but a normal movie would have had more foreshadowing or build up.\r\n\r\nOf coarse this is based on a real person, so I guess life really isn't like a movie, people have ups and downs.\r\n\r\nRussell Crowe was a very tough nut to crack, at first, he seemed rather normal to me, and to be honest not that deep of a character, but the journey you and him go through in the span of his life shown on screen was truly amazing, My hat goes off to you sir.\r\n\r\nBeautiful Mind grossed over $170 million worldwide, went on to win four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, \r\nBest Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, \r\nand Best Supporting Actress. \r\nIt was also nominated for Best Leading Actor, Best Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Score. \r\n\r\nYou can see very clearly why it won each of it's awards, it out stands alot of movies I've seen recently, & would definitely make my favorite movies category.\r\n\r\nOverall 'A Beautiful Mind' shows us what mental illness can do the human being, this is shown through fantastic direction & stellar performances.",

John Nash is given so much depth, and the character is developed so well that by the time all is revealed, even you want to believe what he believes. The beautiful Jennifer Connelly is also worth a mention in this Oscar winning performance.\n\nAlso worth noting is the strong supporting cast, which includes the terribly underused and underrated Ed Harris, as well as the rising Paul Bettany.\n\nAlthough this movie has a lot to offer, it does suffer from a few inconsistencies in that it's not always sure what it wants to be. This movie could at first be perceived as a character study, but at times it wants to be a thriller, and at other times a suspense drama. If you can look past these drawbacks (if you can really go as far as to call them that), there is no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this movie.\n\nOverall, this is a movie absolutely worth seeing, and it would rank highly on a list of my favourite movies.",

            "content": "Will the real John F. Nash, Jr. please stand up?\n\n\"A Beautiful Mind\", which was inspired by the biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, has nothing to do with the real John Nash, Jr. who won the Nobel Prize in 1994.  What we have here is an impostor, a fictional character with the same name as the real John Nash yet director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and company have taken it upon themselves to tell his story much like the actual events complete with title cards at the end of the film stating where Mr. Nash and his wife currently resides and what they are presently doing.\n\nThe real John Nash is a complex, difficult and at times, a selfish and insensitive individual.  What the filmmakers have concocted here is a work of fantasy (forget fiction).  It neither belongs to the real John Nash nor to the psychiatric profession as it inaccurately depicts the schizophrenic condition.  Expunged, among other things, are his arrogant, rude and sarcastic behavior; his mistress Eleanor and his illegitimate son; his homosexual relationships; his arrest for indecent exposure; his divorce from his wife Alicia and his involuntary commitments to numerous psychiatric hospitals.  His delusions about messages from alien creatures are replaced by espionage and spying only to give the film dramatic weight and tension.  The film also takes dramatic license as to the timing of his mental illness.\n\nWith a subject matter that tackles the brilliance and genius of a real life mathematician and his bout with schizophrenia, it is ironic how Ron Howard would insult the intelligence of his audience by dumbing down certain events about the real John Nash.  Is he afraid that audiences will be unable to handle the truth and honesty about John Nash's life and still be sympathetic to him and his condition?  From the get-go, Howard gives us a character that is so likeable unlike the real Nash just so that the audience will automatically care for him despite his mental illness.\n\nHowever, even with all these faults, Mr. Howard certainly knows how to push the right buttons as most people unfamiliar with schizophrenia and John Nash will ignore these inaccuracies and omissions of fact and still embrace the film.  This is the type of film that mainstream audiences love with hardly a single curse word and a happy ending.  Expect the Academy to do the same come Oscar time.\n\nWhat the film has going for it is the fine performances of its two leads Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly.  However, there were times where Mr. Crowe would speak at a very low unmannered voice that one could barely hear what he is saying.\n\nIt is very ironic that another film that I would also have problems with its historical inaccuracies and omissions of fact would also star Mr. Crowe himself - Michael Mann's \"The Insider\".\n\n\"A Beautiful Mind\" avoids the complexity, turmoil and harsh realities of its subject matter.  Contrary to what the filmmakers would like you to believe, the screenplay DOES NOT capture the essence of the story.  \"A Beautiful Mind\" could have been a rich and powerful film of significant human interest.  But it isn't.  Strategically released on Christmas day, it does nothing more than lift one's spirits by using false notes.  It neither inspires nor educates.  It hardly even entertains.",

Another piece of acclaimed cinema from Director Ron Howard. (Apollo 13, Cinderella Man). A Beautiful Mind is a beautifully constructed film that is both emotionally fullfilling and strongly cerebral.  It's another Award Winning film from Ron Howard who has transformed himself into one of the best directors in the game, anything he is associated with ends up being a steller piece of work, A Beautiful Mind is no exception.  A slow-moving, beautifully written and profusely engaging drama that's fused throughout with an intensely dramatic and psychological mystery.  It's based on the true story of Princeton Professor and Nobel Piece Prize winner John Nash, a man of unmatched intellectual capabilities and a sufferer of complicated psychological issues. A paranoid schitzophrenic, John Nash was able to overcome his delusions and become a truly spectacular individual, even after being ridiculed, bullied for years, and undergoing hardcore medical treatments for months at a time.  It's another story of amazing power that inspires and astonishes.\n       Russell Crowe stars as Nash and gives a performance that is nothing short of pure genius.  Another brilliant performance to add to his spectacular resume.  Its a true marvel to watch Crowe at his very best and most engaging.  Jennifer put in a spectacular supporting performance that's one of her best.  Ed Harris, as always, does a wonderful job throughout.  Paul Bettany is great as well.",

            "content": "Anyone who has not seen this film really ought to, as it is probably the best representation of schizophrenia ever committed to the silver screen. I will go into the story a little bit, if you will just indulge me a little.\r\n\r\nIt is the 1940's and eccentric loner John Forbes Nash, Jr. has just been accepted into Princeton University, to join the legion of mathematicians that will direct the course of the war. He doesn't fit in, and isn't taken seriously by his classmates. However, he finds solace in his dear friend Charles, who likes to do things his own way, and always lends a listening ear to John's thoughtful ranting. \r\n\r\nJohn struggles to find his \"truly original idea\" so he can distinguish himself and earn respect, and he is torn between recognition and accomplishment. He does become successful, and we go forward a few years. He has been hired by the government to crack some very elaborate ad tough codes, which have something to do with a top secret nuclear weapon. On the side, he is back at Princeton teaching the eager young minds of tomorrow and it is here he meets the beautiful, confident and ambitious Alicia, who takes a liking to him. \r\n\r\nThe two fall in love and their relationship flourishes, however John's work is getting darker and more dangerous and pretty soon he's convinced there are people after him. He becomes paranoid, fearful and shaken... but is it actually happening to him? This is where the film takes a major turn, revealing a deep secret that changes the life of John Nash forever. \r\n\r\nThere are so many great elements to this movie. First off, it is carried all the way by the brave and mesmerizing performance of Russell Crowe. You really believe he is going through this journey, and we are taken into his world of theories and ideas, in a beautiful and haunting way by the ever versatile director of the film, Ron Howard.\r\n\r\nWhen this film came out, Russell Crowe had just become an overnight star after the 2000 success of Gladiator. The 2002 Oscars were just around the corner and at the time, Rusty had reaped almost every award that he had been nominated for and the final statuette at the Academy Awards was surely looking like it would go to him. Of course, he didn't win it, however his performance has to be one of the best of the decade. \r\n\r\nThis was when I really started to become a Russell Crowe fan; I must have seen Gladiator about 10 times, and was digging deep into Crowe's resume to discover his lesser known and earlier works from Australia. Some roles were pretty standard, and then there were other groundbreaking performances in such films as 'Romper Stomper', 'The Insider' and 'LA Confidential'. \r\n\r\nLater on that year, when A Beautiful Mind came to DVD I purchased it straight away and watched it several times; it still captivated me. I then began to explore the special features and was impressed even more when I saw what Ron Howard went through to bring his vision to the screen. I won't go into detail but it reminded me of what a truly gifted filmmaker he is and when you watch the features and then the film and put it all together, you will understand and agree with me that A Beautiful Mind isn't just a movie, it is a piece of art. \r\n\r\nIt has inspired me to believe that the mind is an incredibly powerful thing, that can help us have, do and be anything, but in the end there is only one thing more powerful than the mind... and that is the courage of the heart. \r\n\r\nTruly a film to be cherished.",

However, after a call by the Pentagon, his life changes radically...\r\nThis is the beautiful story of a man who wanted to be greater than everyone else - but he can't. John Nash is real. And he suffers of paranoid schizophrenia: he is assaulted by delusions, which he can't distinguish from reality, being unable to recognize whether they are true or false.\r\nThis disease, together with the fact that he is not able to socialize with other people, plus his desire to be the best, will take him to the verge of falling. And this is where the whole beauty of the film lies.\r\nRussel Crowe is, first of all, brilliant. So moving, so touching, so extremely endearing and capable of creating within us a feeling of compassion for him and, above all, of identification with him. We see our most delicate and fragile in this lovely character. And this merit of Russel Crowe. Had he not won the Academy Award for Gladiator the year before, he would have won it for this movie. His performace - much greater than in Gladiator - is undoubtedly worthy of the Award of awards.\r\nSecondly, we must talk about Jennifer Connelly, who is almost just as marvellous as Crowe. Her powerful interpretation - which earned her an Academy Award - has the power to thrill the audience and to make us fall even more in love with these characters, with this family apparently destroyed by delusions, that is, nevertheless, able to overcome all difficulties and remain together, bonded and united by their deep love.\r\nThis review wouldn't be complete if we didn't mention Ed Harris, Paul Bettany and Christopher Plummer, the three powerful supporting actors, who manage to entrap us in our belief that Nash is a sane man.\r\nThis strong, ingenious, breathtaking cast joins forces with a beautiful plot and extremely effective and competent directing, creating one of the most wonderful and moving films ever.\r\nKudos to Ron Howard!",
