    "summary": "The film takes place in 1993 when the U.S. sent special forces into Somalia to destabilize the government and bring food and humanitarian aid to the starving population. Using Black Hawk helicopters to lower the soldiers onto the ground, an unexpected attack by Somalian forces brings two of the helicopters down immediately. From there, the U.S. soldiers must struggle to regain their balance while enduring heavy gunfire.",

There are a lot of great actors in this film, I was pleasantly surprised to see \"Jamie fookin Lannister\", Tig from \"Sons of Anarchy\" and a young Tom Hardy (just to name a few). It's a great war film that will take you on an emotional roller-coaster. RIP Tom Sizemore!",

            "content": "\"Black Hawk Down\" is a 2001 war/action movie directed by Ridley Scott, based on the book by Mark Bowden about the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia in 1993.\n\nThe plot follows the US military's attempt to capture two lieutenants of the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The mission goes awry when two Black Hawk helicopters are shot down, leading to a desperate fight for survival as American soldiers are surrounded by hostile Somali forces.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of the film is its intense and realistic depiction of combat. The battle sequences are well choreographed and executed, with a great attention to detail and a sense of chaos and confusion that makes the audience feel like they are right in the middle of the action. The cinematography by Slawomir Idziak is also top-notch, with a gritty and realistic style that enhances the film's visceral impact.\n\nThe ensemble cast is excellent, with standout performances from Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, and Eric Bana. They all deliver nuanced and believable performances, making the audience care about their characters and their fate in the midst of the chaos of war.\n\nRidley Scott's direction is solid, keeping the pace of the film moving along and maintaining the tension throughout. The musical score by Hans Zimmer is also effective, adding to the film's atmosphere and emotion.\n\nOne potential weakness of the film is its lack of context and political background to the conflict in Somalia. While the movie focuses on the intense action and survival of the soldiers, it doesn't provide much insight into the broader geopolitical issues that led to the conflict in the first place.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Black Hawk Down\" is a well-crafted and intense war/action movie that excels in its depiction of combat and the performances of its ensemble cast. While it may lack some context to the larger conflict in Somalia, it remains a gripping and visceral experience that is well worth watching.",

The Pacing in this is the highlight of the film even the slow parts are the start are very well done full of tension. The battle scenes are intense white knuckle action filled with amazing special effects, most of which are practical and look amazing. The music is very well done also however the intensity of battle sounds can drain out the music sometimes and it can just blend in at times but still very distinct and does a great job of enhancing the mood despite not being terribly distinct. The editing is well done also though at times it can be confusing as to what the order of things are that are happening. The only real problem is the acting/characters. The acting is solid with Tom Sizemore being the standout with an incredible performance. But the characters themselves all just lack any individual personality outside of Sizemore. They are very one dimensional and just all blend in and at times I was confused who was who as they all look and sound alike versus a movie like Platoon or Apocalypse Now where all members of the crew are distinct and standout. Though I still liked them all but made it hard for me to feel anything deep when we focused on the individuals themselves. Despite this it is still an incredibly well done film and stands as a Classic War Film, A classic of the New Millennium and highly recommended for any War Film Fan or Fan of any of the actors in this.",

And some flaws from the true sense I can only guess and imagine.  I know it is based on a true story but why in a historical sense did the US Army use so many Humvees and no heavy armored tanks until a very must last ditched effort at desperation hour?  Not a movie flaw so much if sticking to the true story guidelines but a military flaw at the time!  Made no sense to me as the Humvees only had light bulletproof glass and so very many died inside!  If I were a general during this war/conflict I would have gone more \"Patton\" like and sent in more heavily armored divisions!  This to me made no sense and was hard to watch.  That and so many over the top acting performances.  7 out of 10 is the best I can rate this.",

            "content": "Following the ousting of the central government in 1993 amid the civil war in Somalia, the United Nations Security Council authorizes a military operation with a peacekeeping mandate. After the bulk of the peacekeepers withdraw, the Mogadishu-based militia loyal to Mohamed Farrah Aidid declares war on the remaining UN personnel. In response, U.S. President Clinton deploys Task Force Ranger - consisting of 3rd Battalion/75th Ranger Regiment, Delta Force operators, and flight crew of the 160th SOAR \u2013 to Mogadishu to capture Aidid, who has proclaimed himself president.\nTo consolidate his power and subdue the population in the south, Aidid and his militia seize Red Cross food shipments. The UN forces are powerless to intervene directly. Outside Mogadishu, Rangers and Delta Force capture Osman Ali Atto, a faction leader selling arms to Aidid's militia. The US then plans a mission to capture Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, two of Aidid's top advisers. The U.S. forces include experienced men as well as new recruits, including 18-year-old Private First Class Todd Blackburn and Specialist John Grimes, a desk clerk. Staff Sergeant Matthew Eversmann receives his first command, of Ranger Chalk Four, after his lieutenant suffers a seizure. Eversmann responds to mocking remarks about Somalis from fellow soldiers by saying he respects the Somalis and has compassion for the terrible conditions of civil war for the Somali people, saying there are two things they can do, \"We can help, or we can sit back and watch a country destroy itself on CNN.\" The operation begins, and Delta Force operators capture Aidid's advisers inside the target building, while the Rangers and helicopters escorting the ground-extraction convoy take heavy fire. Blackburn is severely injured when he falls from one of the Black Hawk helicopters, so three Humvees led by Staff Sergeant Jeff Struecker are detached from the convoy to return Blackburn to the UN-held Mogadishu Airport. During the ensuing battle, Grimes was separated from the rest of Eversmann's chalk after surviving a RPG explosion. Sergeant Dominick Pilla is shot and killed just as Struecker's column departs, and shortly thereafter Black Hawk Super Six-One, piloted by Chief Warrant Officer Clifton \"Elvis\" Wolcott, is shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade. Wolcott and his co-pilot are killed, the two crew chiefs are wounded, and one Delta Force sniper on board, Busch, escapes in an MH-6 Little Bird helicopter but dies later from his wounds. The ground forces are rerouted to converge on the crash site... \n\nRotten Tomatoes critical consensus reads, \"Though it's light on character development and cultural empathy, Black Hawk Down is a visceral, pulse-pounding portrait of war, elevated by Ridley Scott's superb technical skill.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, saying that films like this \"help audiences understand and sympathize with the actual experiences of combat troops, instead of trivializing them into entertainments.\" Empire magazine gave it a verdict of \"ambitious, sumptuously framed, and frenetic, Black Hawk Down is nonetheless a rare find of a war movie which dares to turn genre convention on its head\". Mike Clark of USA Today wrote that the film \"extols the sheer professionalism of America's elite Delta Force\u2014even in the unforeseen disaster that was 1993's Battle of Mogadishu,\" and praised Scott's direction: \"in relating the conflict, in which 18 Americans died and 70-plus were injured, the standard getting-to-know-you war-film characterizations are downplayed. While some may regard this as a shortcoming, it is, in fact, a virtue\". The film has had a small cultural legacy, which has been studied academically by media analysts dissecting how media reflects American perceptions of war. Newsweek writer Evan Thomas considered the movie one of the most culturally significant films of the George W. Bush presidency. He suggested that although the film was presented as being anti-war, it was at its core pro-war. He further wrote that \"though it depicted a shameful defeat, the soldiers were heroes willing to die for their brothers in arms \u2026 The movie showed brutal scenes of killing, but also courage, stoicism and honor ... The overall effect was stirring, if slightly pornographic, and it seemed to enhance the desire of Americans for a thumping war to avenge 9/11.\" (via Wikipedia)\n\n\"Black Hawk Down\" was directed and produced by Ridley Scott, and co-produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, from a screenplay by Ken Nolan. It is based on the 1999 non-fiction book of the same name by journalist Mark Bowden, about the U.S. military's 1993 raid in Mogadishu. The film features a large ensemble cast, including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Sam Shepard, Jeremy Piven and Tom Hardy in his first film role. Orlando Bloom, Ty Burrell, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau also have minor roles. The film received positive reviews from film critics, although it was criticized for inaccuracies, and sparked controversy for its portrayal of Somalis. Just re-saw \"Black Hawk Down\" and Ridley Scott directs it with perfection and as a viewer you are in the midst of this catastrophic battle in the middle of the most dangerous part of Mogadishu. It\u00b4s a well made and dynamic film, with very authentic battle scenes, but to be honest the acting is wobbly within this large ensemble and some of the actors like Ewen Bremner and Ewan McGregor feels very miscasted. Scott does however manage to keep the film more or less away for the traditional flagwaving a film like this would normally have, but then again the focus is just on the Americans being the good guys trying to do good while most Somalis are enemies. There\u00b4s no real balance there. The Battle of Mogadishu was of course a defeat for the United States,Task Force Rangers and Delta Force trying to help the people of Somalia which made the US to be reluctant to get further involved in Somalia and other regions. Some scholars argue that it was a major factor that affected the Clinton administration's decision to not intervene in the Rwandan genocide, and has been commonly referred to as \"Somalia Syndrome\". \"Black Hawk Down\" is a historic piece with a value, but it also contains controversies and inaccuracies.",

But then again the country of Somalia probably isn't a democracy, they probably don't note their leaders into office. Anyways, it seems like it's going to play out in the style of the first two Call of Duty Modern Warfare games. I'm excited. Holy shit it's Nikolaj from GOT!! And he has an American accent. Wtf?! That's so odd to hear. \n\nThe dialogue is kind of annoying. They're trying to glamorize and make going to war cool. I like Josh Hartnett's character. He actually cares, wants to help the Somalian people out and bring down this crazed general. I can't imagine the amount of adrenaline these guys must be feeling. It must feel both exhilarating and terrifying all at the same time. Damn, they tore that whole city up! They must've shot down more than 100 Somali rebels. It's crazy how out of hand everything got once the first chopper went down. \n\nI'm not a big fan of the color palettes and visual style, but I understand this is a war movie. The movie has surprising and unexpected bits of humor throughout. I felt like the whole movie was just pure action and thrill, which is great, but that's about it. There's not a lot of character development and it felt like there wasn't much sympathy given to the innocent Somali's that were wrapped up in this mess. I don't know whether or not I agree with the U.S. militaries decision to get involved in the whole Somali Civil War, but I do have to give my respects and thanks to the men that fought that day and the ones that fight everyday for the greater good. I understand they were trying to save the country from famine and a corrupt evil warlord, but like the rebel in the movie said, \"You think just because you capture and kill Aidid, you think the war here will stop? It will never stop.\" And he was right. Aidid was killed and the Somali Civil War continued - even to this very day it continues. It's very sad and actually quite frustrating and perplexing how they're still in a civil war. How is it that they haven't come to a resolution? In this matter, I guess it's the thought that counts. They tried to help, but to no dismay. And life goes on. The world can be a very dark and unforgiving place. That's another thing this movie did for me - it was thought-provoking. I don't think I'd watch it again though.",

And for this reason, I would argue that this might be the single most potent war film ever made, as it's incredibly intense and even legitimately disturbing to watch at times.  However, while this might sound like a contradiction, this film also offers top-tier entertainment in regards to its presentation, and the miracle that this film pulls off is that the entertainment value never once compromises the extremely serious and intense tone.  This is bolstered by excellent performances across the board, excellent editing, sound design and music, and some genuinely top-tier technical merits.  It at times looks like a more straight-faced Summer Blockbuster, but it doesn't take long to see that this is actually far, far more significant than that.  It's about as perfect as cinema gets, and frankly this is because it doesn't feel like cinema.",

            "content": "Black Hawk Down is known as a controversial film with a delicate subject matter as its central focus. The plot is taken from author Mark Bowden's account of the events surrounding the efforts of the U.S. Military to capture the Somali military leader Mohamed Farrah Aidid, in the capital of Mogadishu before it ultimately descended into an all-out war zone. The resulting mission which had intended to be stealth get in and get out operation had ended up becoming a battle that cost the lives of various U.S. Soldiers and Mogadishu citizens. The events were marked as a pivotal feat of outside military involvement and changed the course on policy and what would shape significant events to come.\n\nThe film's first depiction of the burgeoning battle gives context to what had occurred before. The poor conditions of its citizens, caused by the famine by control of their leaders and which starts America's involvement to extract Aidid under the command of General Garrison played by Sam Shepard. The film gets to the proceedings pretty quickly. While there is that inevitable feeling of unease as the soldiers make their way to the town centre of Mogadishu, the scene itself is paced very well and makes it all the more disturbing when the mission goes horribly wrong.\n\nThe majority of the film is essentially the battle itself. Soldiers are separated; various bullets; rockets and other forms of weaponry being used. All create this crescendo that drowns the characters as they struggle to survive and complete their mission, and that is primarily the film's strength. The film deftly captures the brutality of warfare and even the confusion of it all. I think that the lack of character development that has been noted in reviews, I believe actively makes the film's point. The chaos that emanates pushes characters aside for little time to quickly focus on others, which creates a disorientating effect that is not so much distracting as authentic. There are big names amongst the cast, and although they play soldiers of a certain rank, none of them think to grandstand and instead play secondary to the story itself.\n\nI think Ridley Scott made a commendable effort of depicting the events as brutal and disorientating. The film may not be everyone, but one can't deny how well-executed the film is and with a brilliant cast of actors that commit themselves to the best of their ability. So, as a war film goes, it's well put together, and as a statement of war, it's effectively sombre.",

The reason this film is not a five star is because some of the camera work is out of focus. Now lets talk about the film. One of the most important part of a war film is the action, and boy does it give it to us the action is like a Michel Bay film but less messy. What makes a war film feel realistic is the editing and sound which are both terrifically made. The cinematography is what makes the film look realistic, S\u0142awomir Idziak made all the darks darker and made the desert look more hot and real. I was very disappointed this film didn't get nominated for Best Picture, but at least it was nominated for best director. This has to be one of my favorite war film and i highly recommend it.

The characters end up painted with broad strokes and then nuanced cleverly, perfect for this kind of movie. \n\nThe film wizzes by, its Brutal, Uncompromising and still surprising. And in 4K it's absolutely superb. It's like watching it for the first time as if it was made this year. Someone's review I read  said that Black Hawk Down was asurvival horror and that's totally true, as I put it on, I remembered the horrific bits; the artery, the fall from the chopper, the pilot's sad face, the guy being shot on the .50 cal. However, as it unfolded, I had forgotten how funny it was and how messy without sacrificing coherence. \n\nBlack Hawk Down, The film that spawned a thousand video games and gave us a vision of early Modern warfare, of a small war before social media and drones. Black Hawk Down is a sensitive rescue mission with Ridley Scott still firing on all cylinders and giving us another unique vision.",

Scott's direction is striking with gritty realistic situations recreating real life encounters in stunning detail. The sweat on faces, bullet shells dropping like blood, the constant gunfire and noise, and the loss of life all make Black Hawk Down feel genuine. Scott shoves you into the heart of the gunfire and keeps you there for the entire film. The suspense is ever present as you never know who will die or when.\n\nThe positive perspective of the military is admirable as it does not depict them as flawless people, but rather comrades in arms desperately trying to survive in a impossible situation. Black Hawk Down is certainly anti-war making the Somali conflict look pointless as the general public consensus did not change, neither was the Somali warlord deposed after this tragically met encounter. The loss of life and brutal violence feel damning of a government that would force its soldiers to endure such pain.\n\nBlack Hawk Down's cast is awesome with a massive ensemble of all stars. Josh Hartnett is excellent and gripping as the rangers' leader Eversmann. He delivers a poignant dramatic performance in the midst of battle as you wonder what else he could have done to save his men's lives. He alongside his men are heroes having faced unimaginable odds and remained alive.\n\nEwan McGregor's Grimes is interesting as the desk man that wants to see combat, then witnesses atrocity, explosions, and death. McGregor is funny, but also saddening as a man that was not prepared for such trauma.\n\nTom Sizemore's McKnight is stalwart as the commanding officer just trying to get his men to the target and then get them home. His steadfast performance within the vehicle was fascinating to see.\n\nLikewise, Eric Bana is excellent and riveting as Hoot, who has seen numerous combat missions. His indifference towards death and focus on the task at hand is intriguing and haunting.\n\nSimilarly, Sam Shepard is brilliant as General Garrison. His worry for his men and distress at how the mission fell apart is engaging throughout all of Black Hawk Down.\n\nEwen Bremner as Nelson and Tom Hardy as Twombly are hilarious in the middle of this dangerous combat mission. They add some much appreciated levity in Black Hawk Down.\n\nOrlando Bloom is devastating as Blackburn. William Fichtner is strong and reliable as Sanderson. Jason Isaacs is wonderful as the stern commander Steele. His accent and presence is piercing.\n\nLastly for the cast, a young Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is unforgettable as the brave Gordon, who tries to save the last man left alive after a helicopter crash.\n\nThe special effects and practical effects are shocking in Black Hawk Down. So much incessant gunfire, constant reloading, RPG explosions, and helicopter crashes are all chilling in Black Hawk Down.\n\nIn all, Black Hawk Down is thoughtful in its message appreciating military sacrifice and bravery as demonstrated by this movie's remarkable cast. Ridley Scott's direction throws you in combat and makes you never forget it.",

            "content": "I was once privy to an online conversation where a group of Iraq war veterans discussed war movies. After establishing which movies they didn't like (The Hurt Locker was the main target of their ire), they began to talk about which war movies they enjoyed. The one movie which came up repeatedly was Black Hawk Down. I suspect this is because of its positive portrayal of its central characters. Most veterans I've run into on the internet are understandably tired of movies portraying them as shell-shocked and unstable individuals who are liable to go on a shooting spree if mildly provoked. The soldiers in Black Hawk Down, while not perfect or incapable of self-doubt, are well-adjusted team players. It is up for debate whether the movie also portrays the American military intervention in Somalia as heroic, but the individual soldiers are certainly portrayed in a positive light.\n\nAs for why I, a non-veteran, like the movie, that largely comes down to the battle scenes. The Battle of Mogadishu is the film's main character, and the conflict takes up most of the run time, with the firefight beginning after a brief introduction to some of the soldiers and continuing almost to the end of the movie, with a few brief lulls. Impressively, despite the chaotic nature of the events portrayed, I generally had a good idea of the tactical situation thanks to the occasional interludes of General Garrison observing the situation from an American airbase. The battle scenes are highly technically impressive and feel authentic - although veterans of the battle have pointed out some artistic liberties, such as the filmmakers giving the Somalis a truck-mounted recoilless rifle, which they did not possess in real life.\n\nSince the focus of the movie is the battle itself, the human characters suffer. I had a much better sense of the characters' motivations in Band of Brothers than I did in Black Hawk Down. I can forgive this, as character development is not the intended focus of the movie. More concerning is the lack of development of the villainous warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid and his militia. I didn't need an in-depth psychological study, but I would have preferred to know more about his goals than what the movie provides, which is essentially a statement that he wanted to weaponize hunger by controlling the food supply. I would also have liked to know why his men are willing to die by the hundreds to protect him. Presumably, he must have done, offered, or threatened something to demand that kind of loyalty, but the movie never explores that aspect of the conflict. The result is a movie that, while good, is one-sided and morally simplistic.\n",

            "content": "Essentially a two hour long flick with no room to breathe, however, is an action packed and well shot film. \n\nOn October 3rd, 1993, an elite team of more than 100 Delta Force soldiers and Army Rangers, part of a larger United Nations peacekeeping force, are dropped into civil war-torn Mogadishu, Somalia, in an effort to kidnap two of local crime lord Mohamed Farah Aidid's top lieutenants. When two of the mission's Black Hawk helicopters are shot down by enemy forces, the Americans -- committed to recovering every man, dead or alive -- stay in the area too long and are quickly surrounded. The ensuing firefight is a merciless 15-hour ordeal and the longest ground battle involving American soldiers since the Vietnam War. \n\n\"Black Hawk Down\", \"Black Hawk Down\", \"Black Hawk Down\". That's the title I hear pop up in conversations every time I speak about war films. It's an old film, one that came out when I was only about two years old. Now, sixteen years later, I'm finally able to see this film. Although I don't think it lives up to the status quo that everyone hypes it up to be, but it's still a solid war film. \n\nEssentially, this did feel like a two hour, non stop, live action film of Call Of Duty. I completely understand that the story takes place in one of the longest ongoing battles in the history of America, however, you never had room to breathe. It was a lot of runnin' and gunnin' for two hours, and it really did feel like Call of Duty. I think sometimes you need to take a breathe and process everything that's going on, otherwise your film will drag a bit. \n\nThe story was interesting enough. I think there were so many characters that it was hard to get attached to them, but I know that wasn't the point of this film. Like I said, I think everyone was so rapid fire and guns blazing that it was hard to analyze what was going on. Trust me, I had tons of enjoyment from this film, but there's not going to be a ton of development in it if that's what you're looking for. \n\nSome of the shots in this film looked pretty amazing. I think the cinematography was one of the highlights of this film, as it really caught my attention. There were some shots that I wanted to take a picture of and remember forever, which is really saying something. For a film that's so high paced and action driven, I think the camera work was really good and appropriate for the situation. Scott's vision with the camera and everyone else behind the lenses really put together a cohesive story with the images. My only real complaint is that the use of slow motion dropped a lot of frames when they implemented it, which made it kind of cheesy at times. \n\nThe action may have been none stop, but it was really well put together. Everyone, from the director, special effects coordinators, stunt doubles, everyone did a fantastic job. They really did a great job of putting together the entire setting, from the locations to the actual fights. I think this film, especially visually, is ahead for its time. It still holds up pretty well in today's media too, which is definitely a plus. \n\nAlthough I didn't love this film, I still thought it was a good war film. There's not a ton of depth to this movie, but it's definitely gritty and fast paced. Definitely a solid film and one I enjoyed watching.",

            "content": "Black Hawk Down is a competent, confident and chaotic war film. It tells the true story of a raid in Mogadishu that lead to the first battle between the Somalian Militia and American Rangers. As the title suggests, a Black Hawk does indeed go down. This is a mighty difficult flick to rate. As a representation of modern warfare, it succeeds substantially and sits in the elite group of visceral war films. But as a complete movie? Questionable. Firstly Ridley Scott is such a consistent director in terms of tackling a genre and producing a film that defines that genre. Black Hawk Down is no different, his eye for technical technique and production is second to none. A war torn Mogadishu, practical explosions and effects, utilisation of real Black Hawks and army equipment. It's authentic, and that is a real important factor for a war film. The narrative subtly explores the cost of war on both sides. The US army losing valuable soldiers and equipment (which financially would set them back quite largely) and the Somalian families who are living in ruins. There will always be one view point that towers over the other, but there is the gritty imagery of war and the aftermath that it leaves behind which proves to be effective. This has a massive ensemble cast, with Josh Hartnett being the lead I guess (he is on the cover, sooooo technically...he is the lead). He doesn't deliver, in fact many of the actors don't. That's not their fault though. Scott purposefully chose to focus on the aspects of war rather than glorified American heroes. Even so, there is such limited characterisation that any loss of life delivers no emotional impact for the audience. It's no spoiler that many succumb to their wounds, and yet we're supposed to feel saddened. I physically cannot feel emotive towards someone who I can't relate to, or even care for. That is what prevents this from being an outstanding war film like many classics before. Jason Isaacs was probably the stand out performance for me. Still a decent war flick, it's powerful imagery just about saves it from being lifeless.",

I've seen my fair share of war movies in the past few months, and this was one that felt extremely authentic. I appreciate how much effort they put into making it realistic, and I thought the presentation of the overwhelming amount of opposition they faced was done well. You felt like the odds were heavily stacked against these soldiers, and that made the entire thing harrowing. For two and a half hours we watch as dozens and dozens of now-famous actors run around, fire guns, and shout at one another. It's such an unrelenting assault on the senses that I did not get to know the characters names let alone their personalities. I was constantly thinking of them solely as the actor who played them. In addition, the frenetic nature of the action made it difficult to figure out where people were within the city and in relation to one another. Perhaps the darkest part of this film is how it dehumanizes the Somali people. In many ways I felt like I was watching a zombie movie or something like that, considering how mindlessly evil they made the enemy. It was to the point that you are expected to cheer when the helicopters swoop in and start slaughtering dozens of men with each sweep. Then they plaster the numbers at the end of total lives lost and we see the relatively small number of American deaths and the massive number of Somali deaths, and I just find myself wondering why they are even counting their deaths considering how glorious they made the deaths appear in the movie. It's still a well-made film, and I was definitely not bored by it, but I wish they made some different choices in the way the story was told.",

Beautiful shots of fleets of helicopters flying over panoramic stretches of the beaches and ocean into war zone. Wierdly reminiscent of Apocalypse Now but with less mentally unsound soldiers this time round. The political message aside, Director Scott told the fiasco story of Black Hawk Down in typical hugely epic dimensions and loudly rousing music score by Hans Zimmer. Scenes of desmembered body parts and fountains of blood spurting were not less shocking than Normandy beach scene in Saving Private Ryan, just lest sustained and intense. But the most thrilling part of the film was star studded cast giving fantastic performance with Josh Hartnett taking centre stage.Like a child in a candy shop, there were many other eye candies like lesser billed actors that were no less amazing, such as Jamie Lannister or Niholaj Costa-Waldau, like coffee perfecting making obsessed Ewan McGregor, Jeremy Preven, the mercenary and highly effective killler soldier Eric Bana and capable medic Tye Burrell.This intervention by American forces in Somalia was no less a fiasco and a waste of human lives as the Vietnam war. This time it was Bill Clinton to be stimatized by a unwinnable disastrous war. Fighing a foreign war do not have happy endings. Not Vietnam war, not Somalia, not Libya, not Iraq, not Afghanistan. All diastasters and USA is wating for flocks of chickens coming to USA to roost. One of the chicens that came home to roost was no doubt black Americans killing white cops. Gruesome images of wiild black skinneies fighting against the almost all white American soldiers were and are searing to the minds of people who watched them.

Ridley Scott does a good job with its cinematography on this one. Though i felt that story telling is out of the line, less connection with its characters and focuses more on the battlefield. Dialogue is lousy at times. Action scenes are so fast paced that will make you're eyes bleed out with different camera angles here and there, bullets, explosions, dust are blowing around, its a mess. But in the end, it leaves a trademark that action packed video games makes this as an inspiration.",

In a way, my initial view of the film was correct, but after giving it my full attention I found the film to be quite entertaining.\n\nBlack Hawk Down was written by Ken Nolan, who hasn't written any other film aside from this. The issue I had with this film is that it lacked any interesting character development, and this made the film feel a bit shallow. The film shares it's focus on multiple characters, making this film a very wide ensemble piece. It would be normal for me to be negative on a film focusing too much on many characters, but instead I found it to be a great approach. Nolan wanted each and every character to be given a notable personality of sorts, which is explored for about 20-30 minutes during the start of the film. So when these soldiers get to battle, seeing some of them get hurt or die it actually is more painful to watch, rather than seeing them as expendable pawns. This ties in with the main theme of the film, which is brotherhood. Each soldier has this bond that is hard to break, which sells the dramatic lengths one is dedicated in helping out another soldier, even if the soldier has already been killed. So overall, I forgive Nolan for not giving the film enough depth to make this a more personal journey, as he gave the film a strong theme for us to follow. There are other issues with this film, mainly involving with the film's lack of an interesting backstory. It states that the film is set on Somalia and that the cause for this mission is because of the war within it, but it's not really touched on in the film, aside from what is being said to us at the start of the film. So at the end of the film when they do touch on the topic again, I found it hard to care whether or not the situation in Somalia is resolved. Nolan also forces in the idea of intrusion from the U.S. and that they are just making it worse for everyone with their involvement. I thought this was would have been a great idea to explore, but it is brought up so very little throughout the film, that when they do crop us again, it just feels off. If the film just plainly focuses on it's soldiers rather than the situation, then this would have been a more nicely rounded film. I found the dialogue of the film to be a bit too typical for me, especially at the start but this becomes less of a bother as things start to get exciting as it hardly becomes a concern, during that time it supports the scene instead.\n\nBlack Hawk Down was directed by the great Ridley Scott. Scott at this time, recently made a huge name for himself in mainstream cinema with Gladiator. Though I have yet to see the film he made after it, Hannibal, I think there was still some faith in the director from the studios and wanting him to helm some ambitious projects. Black Hawk Down is his take on the contemporary style of war. This film could have easily been a did-this-done-that kind of film, lacking in any originality. In a way this film is just that because it never truly explores a concept that hasn't been done in previous war films, but this film is just so good in being just an entertaining war film that I can forgive it for not bringing anything new. Scott, throughout the film has created this heightened tension, creating this sense of desperation in their mission and how things can become so unpredictable. The film's hard-hitting action truly makes it one of the better visceral war films of all time. I also commend Scott and his editor's ability to juggle three squad storylines and maintain to hold our interest with each one. The film would have fallen apart in it's storytelling if the editing wasn't done just right. I personally feel that this was Scott's version or attempt of being like The Thin Red Line, but without the philosophical aspect of it.\n\nThe film's cinematography was handled by Slawomir Idziak. Idziak's notable work includes Gattaca and Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix. Black Hawk Down's cinematography was interesting but not entirely effective. What stands out in the film is the look of the photography. The colors are overly saturated and uses a green/blue palette, which was an odd choice because war is usually depicted as a monotonous picture filled with dull colors in connection with death and suffering. The film does make a statement of being different in it's look, but I didn't feel that this was effective or even necessary. I have no problem in films being stylish, but as long as it doesn't draw away from the film's story. I thought it was a great idea for Idziak to avoid the intensely shaking cam in capturing the heavy action moments, it seems well balanced and not at all distracting.\n\nHans Zimmer is the film's composer and what he has made for this film was a bit underwhelming. It fails to create an interesting theme track for the film, and feels a bit too similar to his work on Gladiator. There were a couple of moments where it does hit the right notes but it's too few for any real praise.\n\nWhat fascinated me with Black Hawk Down's cast is how much of that cast has made a name for themselves and how many great already established actors were in it. Actors like Eric Bana, Jeremy Piven, and Tom Hardy have had a career because of this film. Examples of the already established actors featured are Ewan McGregor, William Fichtner and Ewen Bremner. This film is an ensemble piece so it's hard to truly be critical as the weight is shared between all of the actors, but if there were any that really made an impact on me, they were McGregor, Hartnett, Fichtner, Bremner and Shepard.\n\nBlack Hawk Down isn't the best war film of all time but it is the most that I have had fun with. It would have been perfect if it's story was more well written and had a bit more development in it's characters, but no war film have I seen has matched the intensity of Black Hawk Down and as years go by, i think the power of this film will maintain it's strength.",

Idziak's notable work includes Gattaca and Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix. Black Hawk Down's cinematography was interesting but not entirely effective. What stands out in the film is the look of the photography. The colors are overly saturated and uses a green/blue palette, which was an odd choice because war is usually depicted as a monotonous picture filled with dull colors in connection with death and suffering. The film does make a statement of being different in it's look, but I didn't feel that this was effective or even necessary. I have no problem in films being stylish, but as long as it doesn't draw away from the film's story. I thought it was a great idea for Idziak to avoid the intensely shaking cam in capturing the heavy action moments, it seems well balanced and not at all distracting.\n\nHans Zimmer is the film's composer and what he has made for this film was a bit underwhelming. It fails to create an interesting theme track for the film, and feels a bit too similar to his work on Gladiator. There were a couple of moments where it does hit the right notes but it's too few for any real praise.\n\nWhat fascinated me with Black Hawk Down's cast is how much of that cast has made a name for themselves and how many great already established actors were in it. Actors like Eric Bana, Jeremy Piven, and Tom Hardy have had a career because of this film. Examples of the already established actors featured are Ewan McGregor, William Fichtner and Ewen Bremner. This film is an ensemble piece so it's hard to truly be critical as the weight is shared between all of the actors, but if there were any that really made an impact on me, they were McGregor, Hartnett, Fichtner, Bremner and Shepard.\n\nBlack Hawk Down isn't the best war film of all time but it is the most that I have had fun with. It would have been perfect if it's story was more well written and had a bit more development in it's characters, but no war film have I seen has matched the intensity of Black Hawk Down and as years go by, i think the power of this film will maintain it's strength.",

I am just a huge fan of Swords! so I care least for the guns and explosions. However, Black Hawk Down is a clearly balanced thriller with great technical side, elevated by superb direction from Ridley Scott and of course the battle sequences. It starts of well, but it is not that good as Saving Private Ryan, or more likely I must say that SPR is slightly better than this one, nor it is emotionally or culturally involving as Tears Of The Sun (2003).",

In one scene at the humvies there is drumming over the sounds of battle and when someone gets shot the music briefly stops.  It is moments like that I didn't much like, luckily their not common.  The effects are all good, the helicopter scenes are top notch, and overall the movie is very powerful and enjoyable.  It closely follows what actually happened, it's intense and has some great helicopter scenes, but I preferred We Were Soldiers over it. It has the same kinda idea, trapped behind enemy lines against overwhelming odds, re supplied by helicopters and getting saved at the end by helicopter gunships. They even carry the same weapons. But it's missing somthing.  Number six on my top 15 favorite war movie list",

Matt Eversmann) his fight to save his men and do his job is done extremely well. his devolution to his marines and the men around him is portrayed with great skill and belief.another great performance from (Tom Sizemore)Ranger Lt. Col. Danny McKnight who leads a convoy of humvs to help with the extraction. his cool manner under fire and his presance when the bullets are whizzing round their heads brings some order to the chaos. but most of all Ridley Scott has you their where the \"metal hits the meat\" like never before, the sounds off war are quite something to listen too along with the atmospheric visuals.i couid not recommend this film enough,untill i seen black hawk down saving private ryan was my favourite film of all time, but now Ridley Scotts masterpiece as changed my mind, utterly fantastic film making of a subject that needed bringing into the light.",

Such projects brought us films like Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket and Patton. So maybe high-set standards is the reason that this film felt like such a big disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe story is based on real events and takes place in Mogadishu, Somalia, during a campaign to capture warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid and other high-ranking leaders of his organisation. The film starts with about half an hour that presents the plot and in which we get familiarized with a couple of the characters. Soon a mission to capture two of Mohamed Farrah Aidid's organisations most high ranking leaders is presented, but the soldiers encounter more resistance than planned when almost all of Mogadishu joins in to fight against them. The beginning of the mission is also the point where I think this film starts to derail, from that point forward the film is almost entirely a collection of battle sequences. I grant that these battle scenes are beautifully shot and incredibly well made, but ultimately this is just a film about soldiers fighting with a seemingly endless supply of bullets, helicopters and an arsenal of tired action clich\u00e9s. The reason for having a talented actor such as Evan McGregor in this film eludes me since he's not given any chance to apply his talents. I also felt that I didn't get familiar enough with any of the characters to care about them, some might argue that this film doesn't make us care about the individual and instead focuses on all the soldiers as a collective, but I think that is a very mind-numbing approach to take when you're portraying an event such as this, and it turns the film into war just for the sake of the action.",

The film delves very little into the broader debate over the events that went down on October 3rd and 4th of 1993. This is acceptable, however, as it is this very debate, so important to those of us sitting at home watching these events on TV, that mean next-to-nothing to the men on the ground, fighting our battles for us.

Adapted from the book by Mark Bowden, it involves the failed raid by Americans to capture a Somali warlord in the Battle of Mogadishu. Director Ridley Scott's main objective is to dramatize the graphic battles with brutal realism told solely from the soldiers' point-of-view. Cinematographer Stawomir Idziak incorporates hand held cameras and grainy imagery with Pietro Scalia's dynamic editing that captures the endless barrage of violence with unrelenting immediacy. Solid acting throughout is undermined by a constrained portrayal of individual soldiers that makes it difficult to differentiate between them. When Scott slows the action down to allow for conversation, the dialogue is often stilted. Won Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Written by Ken Nolan. Music is by Hans Zimmer. With Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, and Sam Shepard.",

I thought Ridley Scott directed a very intense and realistic war movie and it's one my favorite Jerry Bruckheimer and Josh Hartnett films. I thought Hartnett's performance as Ranger Staff Sergeant Matt Eversmann was good and Ewan McGregor's performance as Grimes was funny. Ridley Scott directed a top notched cast that includes: Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Jason Issacs, Ewen Bremner, Jeremy Piven, Hugh Dancy, Ioan Gruffudd, Brian Van Holt, Ron Eldard, Matthew Marsden, Thomas Guiry, Ty Burrell, and Sam Shepard. The scene when Hartnett and the other rangers try to get a bullet out of Charlie Hofheimer's character Smith was very disgusting. I heard Ben Foster was originally supposed to play Smith, but he broke his leg while training for the film. Anyway, Great Cast; Great Story; GREAT MOVIE!",

However I would say its easily 30 mins too long if not 60. Also the characters are very 2 dimensional and struggle to connect with the audience. At around 2 hours I was actually get bored despite the amount the action and started to stop caring about the characters' struggle.

            "content": "Black Hawk Down: Typically Racist, Typically Manipulative, Typically American \r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you for showing an interest in reading my blog. I value you for reading my blog and I value your time as well. Hence, please allow me to inform you that if you are expecting me to talk about how awesome and real the animations looked or how freakin' great the movie, Ridely Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001), was or anything of that sort, you are just wasting your time here. Frankly, I am here to convince you to hate the movie, not because there was something wrong in acting or was there an error in editing or stuff like that. I honestly do not know much about those and I do not give a crap about those. I am more concerned about the deeper social fallacies the movie stages. I will talk about how ridiculously and, more importantly, alarmingly manipulative the movie was in falsely justifying the US intervention of Somalia.\r\n\r\n\r\nOften in American war movies, we are told by the continuous texts that is a part of the typical fade-in introductions that the following movies are based certain events. To make the introductions more interesting, the director includes a background music that starts to define the depressing tone of the movie.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001) is no different either. According to the movie, it is \"based on an actual event\", referring to what happened when the US Army went into Somalia in 1992 as a part of Operation Restore Hope. The texts shown in the introduction quickly starts defining Mohamed Ferrah Aidid, as the movie tells is the \"most powerful of the warlords\", as the typical bad guy in a typical American war movie.\r\n\r\n\r\n                The sheer reason I use the word typical is because Ferrah Aidid is black, his fighters speak crazy language in the movie, the US Army care about the civilians in the movie and the US Army is better trained and better strategized in the movie, which makes the movie not \"based on an actual event\" but based on a pack of racist ideas and a pack of lies and here is why.\r\n\r\n\r\n                The movie tries to put across the idea that the US Army were extremely cautious in what they shot at and tried to avoid shooting the innocent civilians that frantically ran around in fear. There were an estimated 1500 civilian casualties just in the 15-hour Battle of Mogadishu. Let us call them as mistakes. Was the US Army that dumb to make a hundred mistakes per hour? Were the Army not supposed to be well trained? The answer is glaring.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey just did not give a crap about the helpless civilians. One of my sources tell me that the US Army shot at anything that moved, which makes me want to laugh at the movie even more because the movie depicts that the Army did not shoot until they are shot at.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne another note, the tremendous reception the movie received, 18 various nominations in which they won 3 of those, in the media is completely beyond my apprehension. People just could not fathom what the heck the problem was with this movie or they just chose to disdain it, this movie should not have merited such reception.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Sayem, aren't the nominations in the categories such as best director, best actor or stuff like that? I am so glad you asked. Let us go back to 1954 and talk about another movie Herbert Biberman's Salt of the Earth. This movie follows the strike of Mexican American miners of the Zinctown, New Mexico for higher wages and equal treatment with other Anglo miners. I am giving movie a special because this movie was rather blacklisted, accused of having something to do with communism and banned from the public. Although granted that McCarthyism was in full swing during the Cold War era, it just seems completely unfair and having something to do with racial reasons, as Salt of the Earth had white guys as the bad guys, that Black Hawk Down avoided the same consequences when it presented more reasons to be banned than Salt of the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't ask me if I know what really happened in Somalia in 1992 and 1993. I do not. The reason I do not know what happened in the nation is because I, like you, depend on the American media for information and the American media I don't believe is anything to go by.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I at least know that Mohamed Ferrah Aidid was a beloved leader of Somalia, and not a powerful warlord, who just could not figure out why the UN and U.S. forces were present in the nation. He just wanted the UN and the U.S. to leave the Somalis alone. He therefore as a result started challenging the presence of the UN and especially the United States. And I don't think what happens if the United States is challenged needs a special mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also know that Somalia is a country that has always been rich in natural resources. Major gasoline companies such as Shell and Chevron along with others are stationed not only in Somalia, but also in many other African countries i.e., Angola. African labor, when juxtaposed with American labor, costs peanuts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason I wanted to write a review on Black Hawk Down in particular is because I have watched it twice. The first time I watched it, I was na\u00efve because I would be glad whenever a Somali was shot in the movie and I always took the Americans as the heroes. In short, I was manipulated by the movie and I am embarrassed about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter taking a class on race and ethnicity, which I admit opened my eyes up, I just started realizing how wrong I was and, more crucially, how wrong the U.S. has been on not only Somalia but on numerous other occasions. I sincerely hope that my review served as a help to my readers in opening their eyes up as well and start sharing my perspective when watching and analyzing other typical American war movies.",

Writer Ken Nolan does an amazing job of portraying the events that took place during October 3rd 1993. Agreed a bit of 'Americans are the Heroes' theme is always laced into the story, but then again, the movie is American right?

All the ones before however, came before my serious film affection started. I revisited it mostly because I take it under a more critical observation.\n\nBlack Hawk Down is one of the rare modern-day war films which can easily withstand comparison to such genre giants as The Longest Day or A Bridge Too Far. \n\nIt features a fine ensemble cast (with a lot of British actors playing US Rangers - aren't there enough American guys that could play these roles?), including one of my personal favourites, Ewan McGregor, alongside Josh Hartnett (not the brightest acting-bulb, but he doesn't have to do much else than shouting commands anyways^^), Tom Sizemore, Jason Isaacs, William Fichtner (probably my favourite performance of the film), Eric Bana (he doesn't have to speak much either, for our own good) and Orlando Bloom (in a tiny role - we were lucky again) amongst others, of then-aspiring actors, who now, more than a decade later, evolved in some serious box-office stars (or amateur porn stars respectively) - and the performances were just fine across the board - despite my sarcastic commentary.\n\nBlack Hawk Down is a pure war film with only little anti-war undertones. We get to see a LOT of patriotism and heroism, even a squad that escapes Mogadishu on foot after the Pakistani UN HUM-VEEs are overloaded. And, on the other hand, countless anonymous masses of black Somalians die by the hands of our heroes. It's war film logic and it's ok like that. The US testosterone trip is a bit calmed down by the fact that it actually was a UN mission these soldiers were on (although, contrary to the sources and real life ongoings, the role of the non-US troops is almost completely undiscussed). Nevertheless, the US Army had a heavy hand in the production of this film - you can figure this out just by looking at the details of the uniforms, vehicles, weapons, etc.\nLots of consulting and Army money made this film possible, and I have absolutely no problem with such procedures if the final result is so good-looking.\n\nWhat could have been one of the great films that honour the UN peace missions (like Hotel Rwanda for example), is a huge load of heroism underscored with machine gun fire. A lot of talented people tried to accomplish that though - and the result is worth watching (brief thought: Ridley Scott is pretty underrated for his versatility - he has made a classic horror film, a classic science fiction movie, one of the all-time feminist flicks, revived the sword and sandal genre, debuted with a costume period piece and his lesser-acclaimed films include a war film, a medieval Robin Hood adaptation and another medieval epic, a gangster/mob film, a bunch of straight action and crime pics and a campy melodrama, and, not to forget, one of the most influential TV ads ever).\n\nAll in all, it's a clean cut, technically perfect, war film that you feel like revisiting some of the old classic war film awesomeness I compared it to in one earlier paragraph.",

            "content": "Jeez, 2001 wasn't even over yet, and Jerry Bruckheimer and Josh Hartnett were already getting back together for a military film to make up for \"Pearl Harbor\", which I, well, actually liked quite a bit, but then again, I'm the only one, and even then, I think that it had some major, so I am glad to see compelling subject matter of this type in the hands of a brilliant storyteller like Ridl-I'm sorry, but I just can't finish jokingly typing that, because Ridley Scott really isn't all that great of a storyteller, even though he knows his technicality well enough to make quite a few films that are still pretty good. If nothing else, the man knows how to put on a good show, though he does have his flukes of strong storytelling, such as this film, so he's certainly further back on the overrating scale than Eric Bana (Come on, Rick, even Ewen Bremner, one of the most Scottish men alive, did a more convincing American accent). So yeah, I Scott had his heart in this project, or at least about as much as he can put his heart into non-mediocre storytelling, either because he's such a proud American wannabe, or because he's hoping to make up for not getting Best Director for \"Gladiator\", which won Russell Crowe Best Actor, for doing only so much, over Tom Hanks in \"Cast Away\". Well, I guess Scott's efforts paid off, or at least to a certain extent, because although he got that second Best Director nod, he still lost to ol' Opie, whose film starred - you guessed it - Russell Crowe, continuing to steal Scott's glory, even though he didn't win the Best Actor award he should have gotten. Yup, they gave Crowe the Oscar when he didn't deserve it, and when he deserved the heck out of it the following year, he didn't get it, so I guess Ridley Scott's getting two nominations for Best Director isn't the questionable decision by the Oscars. Seriously though, this film is pretty much a make-up effort for most everyone, including Ewan McGregor, who was really good and all in something as fluffy as \"Moulin Rouge!\", but still needed this film to show that he can sure pick some cool films, which makes it all the more unfortunate that his next project was another \"Star Wars\" prequel. Well, at least that was the mentality of a lot of people, because I actually also liked \"Attack of the Clones\", yet another testament to how I'm not exactly the most agreeable critic out there, which isn't to say that you be discouraged about seeing this film, as most people agree with my deeming this film a good one, even though they might not be so agreeable with my statement that this film still falls a bit short of full potential, and for a couple of reasons.\r\n\r\nAgain, Ridley Scott's usual storytelling sloppiness is at a relative minimum, being not necessarily absent, but thinned out enough for you to claim a stronger grip on substance value than usual, so you can see the irony in the fact that, this time, it's the actual concept and structuring of worthy subject matter that fails to be quite as meaty as it probably should be, because although this film compels as both visceral entertainment and as a decent drama, substance faces its share of structural issues, especially when the development segment concludes with the initiation of the notorious Battle of Mogadishu, whose essentially taking up most of the body of the film is good and realistic and all, as well as made a touch less problematic by action's being strong, yet gets to be much too exhaustingly excessive, tainting the film with a kind of freneticism that, after a while, leaves you to not simply all but lose investment in the substance behind the action, but lose attention more than you would expect when looking at darn good action. There's plenty of kick to substance outside and even during the action, with the latter also keeping you going with style at its sharpest, so it's not like the film ever slips into underwhelmingness, no matter how much it slips into overstylized excessiveness, and yet, whether it be because of Scott's being able to handle only so much when it comes to redeeming flawed material, or simply because of Scott's own limitations as a flawed storyteller, things get to be excessive, thus sparking repetition that does a number on emotional resonance, much like a certain other flaw that pertains to familiarity: conventions. The film turns plenty of conventions on their heads, and even established many worthy conventions that have since been done to death, yet for every bypass or supplementation of conventions, this film plummets into a trope that was already done half-dead by 2001 and spawns a degree of predictablity that slows down the momentum of investment in story and characters, both of which are, in all fairness, flawed from the get-go in their crafting, or lack there of. No, this film isn't completely cleansed of exposition, having enough range and depth to development to keep substance alive, yet not enough to keep you thoroughly engaged, as story and character development is undeniably a bit light, facing flesh-out limitings that call more to attention most everything from the distancing gratuitousness of extremely violent images, to more natural shortcomings in story. This film follows subject matter that is indeed compelling, though not quite as sweeping as the final product thinks it is, boasting a story concept that isn't necessarily minimalist, yet overblown a bit in execution by a hefty scope that doesn't do too much more than spark subtlety lapses and an emphasis on how the final product outstays its welcome. Now, this film's runtime of nearly, or in the case of the extended cut, over two-and-a-half hours is generally tight, yet things do still get to be overlong, exposing the natural limitations in this film's still worthy subject matter, while other, more consequential shortcomings, combined with a degree of overambition, leave the final product to fall short of its still pretty high potential. Still, for every shortcoming, the film accels, not to where it ultimately stands as the truly upstanding film that it could have been, but certainly to where it rewards more often than not, even as far as musicality is concerned, though not quite as much as you would expect, considering who's tackling said musicality.\r\n\r\nI'm perfectly comfortable with saying that Hans Zimmer might very well be the greatest living film score composer, yet his level of excellence, while certainly consistent is considerable height, relies heavily on the subject matter of the project that will go supplemented by Zimmer's typically upstanding musical tastes, whose opportunity for deliverance isn't entirely as potent as you would expect it to be when it is attached to the subject matter of something as typically music-driven as a Ridley Scott film, particularly this one, as this film's tone has an of almost alternative rock kind of overstylizing intensity to it, broken up by the perhaps too boastful, sharp and, well, somewhat generic sensibilities of classic Middle-Eastern chants, that Zimmer has no choice but to stay faithful to, thus making for one of Zimmer's less impressive scores, which is hardly saying anything, as Zimmer can do no wrong, and does not do just that with this project (What?), cutting through many of natural shortcomings with enough range and musical sharpness to supplement both substance and stylish artistry. This artistry goes further brought to life by S\u0142awomir Idziak's cinematography, which is all too often presented with environments that don't add too much opportunity for visual style, but, on the whole, excellent, with consistently strikingly crisp definition, yet still plenty of fitting and ruggedly handsome grit, broken up by quite a few magic moments of photography - from scenes graced by something of a palette-heavy kind of magic hour, to such sequences as a meeting scene early on that is primarily illuminated by sparce natural lights creeping into a dark setting - that are, well, to put it simply, breathtaking. Idziak's photographic efforts face natural limitations, but are strong at their worst and most often excellent, with quite a few exceptional moments, yet the technical remarkability doesn't end there, as this is a film that is powered even by some of its most practical forms of technicality, such as editing, which isn't all that deliciously stylish, but handled with expertly nifty tightness by Pietro Scalia, while Michael Minkler, Myron Nettinga and Chris Munro deliver on thumpingly immersive sound design. Technical sharpness can be found throughout this film, yet is, as you would expect, at its sharpest and perhaps most realized when action comes into play and delivers, because as excessive in presence and frenetic in intensity as much of the action is, every battle is, at the very least, viscerally thrilling, with grand and dynamic staging, complimented by effective special effects and the aforementioned proficiency in practical technical design. At the very least, this film accels technicality to a near-phenomenal level, as I would expect a Ridley Scott film to do, as sure as I would expect a Ridley Scott film to boast a story that is strong than the directorial storyteller and can, of course, be found in this film, up to a point, as this film's story concept has about as many natural shortcomings as its execution has its own shortcomings, though not so many that the value of this subject matter can be easily ignored, being high enough to give this film both immediate intrigue and potential that doesn't go explored as much as it should in Ken Nolan's script, but still goes well-explored enough by Nolan to find itself executed with a generally tight structure, complimented by good dialogue and strength in what extensive charaterization there is, which is itself complimented by the performances behind the characters, because outside of Eric Bana's typical bland, one-note and questionably-accented mediocrity, most every talented member of this ensemble cast bring well-written characters to life with charisma and even a degree of depth, if not sharp emotional range, that graces this film's crucial character department with additional compelling color. The onscreen performances carry substance a long way, going matched in effectiveness by a certain offscreen performance whose excellence is all too rarely seen in a Ridley Scott film, because although Ridley Scott's direction can only go so far before plummeting into its usual subtlety lapses, excessiveness and other flaws, it surprisingly does a lot to make this film as rewarding as it is, being not only technically competent, but effective enough with genuine storytelling to bypass many of the exposition issues and draw genuine engagement value, broken up by emotional resonance that defines the depth and range to this film's substance, and punctuates this Scott's relatively high inspiration in storytelling. Now, don't get me wrong, it's not like Scott is exceptional as director or anything, but he does more than usual, and the film's quality reflects that, going diluted by shortcomings, but still having enough kick to compel as both entertainment value and as an engrossing war drama.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the battle, the final product is left beaten by the exhausting excessiveness of action that punctuates a consistent freneticism that dilutes subtlety, and with it, the obscurity of story conventions, story structuring flaws and natural story limitations, whose being layered with a not-too-fitting grand doesn't do too much more than drag things out and intensify the emphasis on other substance issues that hold the film back, though not too far, as the final product delivers on good score work, as well as remarkable photography and technicality that compliment strong action that breaks up, if not occasionally livens up a generally strong story concept's execution's compellingness, brought to life by Ken Nolan's mostly strong script, a strong cast and an unexpectedly strong directorial performance by Ridley Scott that helps in making \"Black Hawk Down\" an entertaining and more often than not engrossing dramatisation of the events of the brutal Battle of Mogadishu.\r\n\r\n3/5 - Good",
