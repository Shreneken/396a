Romance, suspense, drama, a bit of comedy and loads of action.\nThe book \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" was written by Alexandre Dumas (the same author who gave us \"The Three Musketeers\") in 1844 and this film follows closely to the book (which is a large reason why it is so great), with a few minor changes to the ending.\nThe acting is superb!  Jim Caviezel was outstanding as the lead character (Edmond Dontes), Guy Pearce providing a memorable performance, Henry Cavill in one of his first films shows that he was talented at an early age and Dagmara Domińczyk held her own against this amazing cast! Other notable actors are Richard Harris (an award-winning and celebrated actor in his own right) was outstanding in his role as \"the Priest,\" who teaches and guides our main character through difficult times.  Luis Guzmán as Edmond Dontes's faithful companion played a bit of comic relief in an ingenious way.  James Frain was also brilliant in his role as a corrupt politician.\nThere are many more actors who had phenomenal performances as well at this whole cast was in concert to bring this story to life the way it was meant to be told.",

It's a perfect story of vengeance and redemption. Plotted maniacally and with purpose, cold to the bone and ever so rewarding. That's my only sticking point, otherwise this is a perfect movie and casted so well. You hate the bad guys and root for the good, this movie has everything. Don't just add it to your list, watch it next - watch it now, what are you waiting for? (Seen it about 7-8 times)",

            "content": "Fantastic adaptation of the Dumas classic although it takes a slight detour in the end which changes the story into one of divine justice and not necessarily revenge. Jim Caviezel plays the Innocent Dantès who's life is destroyed by his supposed friend Mondego (Pearce) with the help of Villefort (Frain). Caviezel plays this naive character who changes into a even greater, more scheming and more vindictive character than Pearce. Both play their roles with aplomb. Luis Guzmán as Jacopo steals nearly every scene that he's in as he seems to represent the last remaining remnant of a conscience that Dantes may still possess. When I first saw this film, knowing the vengeful turn the novel takes, I thought it odd that Mondego's son Albert (played by a young Henry Cavill) bears no resemblance to his father, Fernand Mondego (Pearce) and how Albert seems to resemble another. Dagmara Domińczyk, who plays the hapless Mercedes, seems to be the most loving character, who has never forgotten Edmond and the love she held for him. She was like Dantes an innocent in this story who was never a schemer, but only took advantage, out of necessity. when Dantes is taken away. Finally, Richard Harris as Abbé Faria is the voice that cries out in the wilderness that God will carry Dantes through all of this and that God will give him justice. The reveal in the end is the most satisfying morsel of this morality play and it is reflective of Abbé Faria's words to Dantes' in the Chateau d'If and in the words of Jacobo: \"Once again Zatara, God sees you out the corner of his eye.\" For although Dantes had suffered for over 13 years, God kept him whole for the reward and justice he always deserved.",
