            "content": "Wow...This is one of the most soul less things I've ever seen. The acting is so naturally nonchalant its almost fascinating. There is way too much dialogue also. The jokes never got one laugh out of me. The cinematography is the definition of uninspired. Everything just blends in with a greyish metal and looks like every other Sci-Fi film since 1982. The special effects have a decent amount of practical effects and the CGI is dated but average. The music just like everything else is perfectly generic and forgettable. The editing is the most bizarre part of this. It feels like this is a Sci-Fi Film, A Noir Film & A Comedy all merged together. And the end result is a film that has no clear identity, tone or bite to it. half the time I can't tell whether the film is trying to be funny or serious. The pacing is oddly enough just ok. Never did I feel a scene went on too long (this is only a 1 Hour 30 minute film) but it never built tension or ramped up anything it just stayed at a perfectly consistent pace. This film can be summed up as if a computer was given millions of dollars to make a big budget film this is what it would present as the finished product. I've seen much much worse films than this. This isn't broken it just doesn't have any redeeming qualities to it. It's Not Good, I wouldn't even call it average its perfectly Below Average-Average. Skip this because the film clearly doesn't care so why should you.",

He's saying the same funny jokes we like him doing and he's great. The story is kinda like a rip off high budget  version of Austin powers. But for some reason this movie really reminds me of scooby doo 2 because of the visuals and music. Maybe the same people did both movies. Who knows but I like that feeling.

How can you not like a movie that has Randy Quaid, Hottie Rosario Dawson, Joe Pantoliano, Peter Boyle, Burt Young, John Cleese, Illeana Douglas, Jay Mohr, Jacynthe Rene (can you get me..) and the beautiful Pam Grier. It is chock full of stars of various fame set on the moon. The criticism of the language and sexual content is absurd. It is one Eddie Murphy's least offensive films of all. Everything is well timed. Love that french maid. Lastly the comparison to the fifth element. I have to question whether the critic ever saw the 5th Element to say that.\n\nAt least the comparison to the Matrix with the chase scene in the tunnels is acceptable. Still, it is explainable and fits the movie rather than a copycat. Did I mention the french maid?\nThen the criticism of Murphy himself. He may be vulgar and a bit brash at times but he always gave a great performance. Then the cast around him... they are great. This is one of Dennis Quaid's best films as corny as his character may be, it is memorable. \nForget the critics reviews. Enjoy this movie for what it is, a fun romp on the moon. Sit back and enjoy Eddie Murphy in a completely alien environment from any other movie he has made. It is well worth your time.",

Having on the its moon instead of on Terra didn't really add a lot to the movie except to facilitate a flimsy backstory and some scenes where people required environmental suits, and that had little payoff.\n\nThe benefits of being a sci-fi action comedy is to have laser effects for the blasters, and androids, which are used to various levels of humor.  \n\nEddie Murphy is great, and he plays well with Rosario Dawson, and if nothing else, you have to admit Randy Quaid is funny: the character would have been much different in someone else's hands.  I'll have to admit I thought it was Terry O'Quinn (\"Lost\": John Locke), which made even funnier at the time, but it's a good job done.\n\nHonestly, Eddie Murphy and Rosario Dawson feel a little big for their roles, but the story is good: a former smuggler turns legitimate business owner has to find the mob boss behind the people trying to kill him.\n\nWhile I do think this is an average movie, it is solid, and I don't think I would go changing a lot to it.  I could see a couple versions of a reboot, but in 2020, they'd probably put it in the MCU.",

The acting is on another plane of existence, the set design is advanced and detailed, and the story itself is touching and fun for anyone.

            "content": "Being one of the worse box office bombs ever isn't a good start really is it. Yet to look at the trailer, the sci-fi fantasy aspect and the films title you could be fooled into thinking this might not be too bad. The title is pretty sweet if you ask me, definitely an 80's movie title right there.\n\nThe plot is set in 2080 and mainly on the moon which is now called Little America. A location where gambling, girls, criminals and all things seedy are rampant, a bit like Las Vegas in the old days. Eddie Murphy is a retired smuggler who runs a nightclub on the moon and wants a quiet life, but this is all messed up when some goons come along and force Murphy out by destroying his club under the orders of a mysterious kingpin. Its now up to 'Pluto Nash' to find out why, who is the man behind it all and try to get his club back, or what's left of it.\n\nI think the first issue with the film are the visuals. The film is oldish but not that old and unfortunately the CGI effects are pretty poor. Shots of the moon, moving vehicles, the lunar surface and of course Little America just look average and obviously CGI. When we close in on the urban areas the sets aren't too bad in design but again its terribly obvious its all sets. It all looks like a very mediocre attempt at a 'Blade Runner-esque' grimy neon lit urban district. The colour palette doesn't really help with everything being grey and boring, yes I know its the moon and the moon is typically grey but come on. There were some nice 50's-esque designs on some buildings and vehicles though, there was that element throughout the film but it still felt drab and lifeless, virtually black and white.\n\nThen you have all the interior sets, design and costumes...its all grey!! everything is grey! flippin' eck!. Not only that but the interior designs look so dated, like its all been reused from a 60's TV sci-fi show. I understand that doesn't necessarily make it bad, there are plenty of examples where films have deliberately gone down the homage route or retro design/vibe which can work wonders giving a great charm factor. The problem here is the film had a massive budget and you wonder what they actually used it on.\n\nTake the robot character played by Quaid (and the maid robot character). What they have done is simply apply a lot of makeup to Quaid to give him a doll-like appearance, then he merely acts out the robot role. Now again this can be done and it can work but probably best in low budget films that have little choice. In a big production it just tends to feel lackluster, the maid robot was the same but dressed up in a sexy French number as if that makes it more acceptable. I did quite like the 50's sci-fi sense I got from Quaid's robot though, like a butch Robbie the Robot in human form...kinda hehe.\n\nWhilst watching I also found the plot to be a tad confusing really, or at least it didn't make much sense because it was all a muddle of grey. There are a lot of character names flying about here, a lot of seemingly pointless stuff, aimless boring dialog and not much action believe it or not. We just move from one cheap looking grey set to the next with little to laugh, disappointing seeing as its supposedly a Murphy sci-fi action romp.\n\nBut is it? you think it is but its not really, its more like a 1950's nightclub murder noir homage, 'Harlem Nights' in space perhaps. I must admit to thinking of 'Total Recall' at times whilst watching, it has that kind of vibe going on, minus all the excellent action and blood of course. Do I get the feeling this was made and acted the way it was on purpose?...was it?! I'm not sure, I'd like to think that but deep down I really doubt it. I just think it was a poorly executed movie which had potential to become a bit of a classic. I can see why people might enjoy bits of it like Quaid's cheesy robotic performance and the minor visual gags dotted throughout, but end of the day this really feels like its trying to achieve what 'The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai' achieved.\n\nI'm still not really sure whether or not this film was intentionally made like a low budget sci-fi B-movie for artistic reasons, or it just came out that way. The more I think about it, this might have worked much better as a short TV series, it certainly has the look and feel.",

There were many boring parts throughout that just had one-dimensional people and one note acting and bland dialogue that nobody will ever remember for longer than a week. I didn't even think they were trying to be funny most of the time because you are provided with lots of forgettable talk scenes and when the movie tries to bring you laughs, it fails and you are just sitting in your seat with a blank look on your face waiting for at least one decent joke to be presented. The consensus is exactly right when it says that Eddie Murphy was on autopilot because it seemed like he wasn't even trying to give a good performance here and he was going through the motions hoping that this film would be successful so he could receive a big paycheck and look what the results were in the end for this movie, this is difinitely one of his worst films ever. I however give the movie one star because I thought the effects in the movie were decent and the sets looked good, it's just everything else that brings the movie down on a lot of levels. 2002 had to be a rough year for him for also being in other disappointing films like Showtime and I Spy.

The script creates situations where characters are shooting at each other and there should be some tension or at least excitement but you won't care about the characters and there aren't any big action setpieces that will get your blood pumping.

It just might be the worst value for money though, with a reported budget topping 100M and a box-office of less than 5 it makes Jonah Hex look like a wise investment.\r\nBut despite this it is more sad than bad.\r\n\r\nI can't possibly see where they thought the laughs were going to come from... I can't fathom which parts were supposed to be entertaining... Worst of all I can't really see where the money was spent...\r\n\r\nI just sincerely hope it wasn't Randy Quaid's salary.\r\n\r\nPluto Nash was made by the same guy that made Tremors which is the inverse if Pluto Nash, a low budget / high entertainment affair that is remembered fondly by all that have seen it. Pluto Nash wants to be quirky, cool, edgy, funky and hip but is really none of these things.\r\n\r\nIt is 2080 and the Moon has been made hospitable for humans. Pluto Nash (Eddie Murphy) is the guy who everyone on Earth's satellite adores - except the bad guys who want to force him to sell his bumpin' club to them.\r\n\r\nAfter a run in leaves his club a smouldering pile of rubble (like this film) Nash sets off with waitress Dana (Rosario Dawson - who obviously spent her paycheck on implants after filming ended) and his faithful robot Bruno (Randy Quaid).\r\n\r\nThe trio traverse the moon trying to lay low out of the gunsights of the bad guys while working towards finding who is ultimately responsible for their situation. Along the way they encounter many recognisable faces that add nothing to the film, Jay Mohr, Peter Boyle, Pam Grier, John Cleese and Alec Baldwin among others.\r\n\r\nI think the aim was for Nash to be cool and likable, Dana the cute love interest and Bruno the comic relief.\r\nAll fail. As does everything else in the film.\r\n\r\nBut again Pluto Nash is as harmless as it is pointless, unlike the braincell shattering Tank Girl it made me want to sleep more than vomit - admittedly neither is an endorsement for the film - but the issue remains how could something cost so much look so ordinary?\r\n\r\nNow I know how the Miami Heat must feel.\r\n\r\nA big budget light comedy set on the moon and featuring its own fading star in Murphy was never going to be a big hit. This can't be the fault of director Ron Underwood but the big-wigs who greenlit it and opened the coffers. The absolute ceiling for this film was Demolition Man, itself decidedly average. The floor was Tank Girl, which Pluto managed to avoid but just barely.\r\n\r\nNow you tell me; is a ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR investment worth making for a film that at best could end up mediocre?\r\n\r\nFinal Rating - 3.5 / 10. Pluto Nash sucks, but it is isn't the end of the world... unless you happened to be the one who covered the budget.\r\n\r\nIf you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 800 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",

It's nowhere near the disaster that critics and box office receipts would have you believe, in fact, it's a much better film than either Norbit or any of Murphy's live-action kiddie flicks.  What was it that worked for me?  Murphy wisely brings his leading man charm to the role, Rosario Dawson is an appealing leading lady and she shares a nice screen chemistry with her co-star.  I also loved Randy Quaid's bizarre yet tone perfect performance as Murphy's robotic bodyguard.  I had a lot of fun with this one.  Definitely look for this to develop a cult following.

Pluto is just not big or dynamic enough of a character to carry on an entire film. an owner of a night club seriously? The second is the fact that the story arch has so little happening, build up,tension or little moments where we can just rest and get to know the characters. Strangely enough there's no time for rest and there's nothing happen at the same time so how is this even possible?, well its possible with this film. \r\n\r\nthe musical score was actually quite nice this however leads to yet another problem the score is too good for its film, theirs all this grand music but whats happening on screen is so mediocre that you feel the film is forcing you to feel these emotion and that there calling you stupid if your not feeling them.\r\n\r\nOne could go on and on about this film so ill end with these facts, its flat, uninspired, forced, soulless, unadventurous, dumb, and most importantly unfun or  unfunny they should have studied the movie Galaxy Quest a little closer that was a film that did science fiction comedy right.",

With production values so garish you thought they were used in video games of that era, \"Pluto Nash\" decides to cover it up by- just adding more layers of bad effects! The plot was like if they took Total Recall and put it on the moon and subtracted the violence and Arnold out and called it a comedy. If that's not enough the final plot twist comes across quite bafflingly. Other problems are resolved with the 'Batman shark repellant' method. Basically if we haven't told you about it, we have a solution anyway to get out of it, that we'll just make up with a new term or special effect and hope you'll agree. Don't get me wrong \"Pluto Nash\" is entertaining if you like albinos, a robot with down syndrome, and... Eddie Murphy. Sad thing is.. He's made worse films for less money!",

Apparently, the screenplay was stuck in Hollywood limbo for nearly 20 years waiting to be greenlit, perhaps it should have stayed there.\nI don't know who it's supposed to appeal too, it's seemingly meant to be a futuristic update/spoof of 30's gangster movies but it's too childish for adults and will probably go over the heads of kids. \nEddie Murphy plays Pluto Nash, a nightclub owner on the moon who becomes Mafia enemy #1 when he refuses to sell his club so they can build a casino in it's place. He goes on the run with waitress/singer Rosario Dawson & robot bodyguard Randy Quaid.  Many fine talents are also on the cast list but each and every performance is just embarrassing. The effects look cheap and some of the sets look as though they were filmed in someone's garage.\nIt would be interesting to know how this movie cost $100 million (to think at least 50 better films could have been made with the same amount).

[i]The Adventures of Pluto Nash[/i] (2002)\nDirector: Ron Underwood\n \nBudget: $100,000,000\nGross: $4,411,102 - or 4.4% of the budget.\n \nNow, finally, we have a movie on this Flops countdown of sorts that is just...boring....\n \nEddie Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Jay Mohr, and Randy Quaid all star in one of the most boring movies to possess a mildly interesting premise in the history of the world. Joe Pantoliano and an African-American albino fellow round out the cast. Nobody told any of them that they should try to be funny, apparently. Because they all just prove to be really, really boring.\n \nThe movie starts off interestingly enough. I forget how, though. After sitting through the entire thing, I don't remember too much of anything about the plot, or the characters, or the dialogue. Other than that it was bland, inoffensive, and not funny at all.\n \nPam Grier cameos as Pluto's mom. I think she's supposed to be funny. John Cleese and Luis Guzman come close to dimpling my cheeks, but every time the camera cuts to what I like to refer to as the 'enwhitened' Eddie Murphy - this passive, unconcerned feeling overtakes me. My eyes glaze over until Rosario shows back up. Although even she isn't that hot in this.\n \nAnd who's the super-mega-evil crime lord boss keepin' Pluto down this whole time? It's not James Rebhorn - nope. It's Eddie Murphy as a Pluto Nash clone.\n \nYes. The villain is a clone of the protagonist. They fight, they're wearing the same thing, everyone's confused, someone asks Pluto a question only he would know - or something similar...\n \nEveryone lives happily ever after in Pluto's new nightclub. The end. I'm literally about to fall asleep at work as I type this. This film redefines 'stultifying.' And this [b]still[/b] isn't worse than [i]The Stupids[/i]. Wow. \n \nI hate this movie. $100 million dollars could feed a lot of people, but instead, we get this. \n \n[b]1/10. An Absolute Crime Against Humanity[/b]. \n \n[u]Interesting Trivia?[/u] Not a whole lot. Let's see...\n \n1. Eddie Murphy was paid 20 million dollars for this movie, which didn't even make back but a quarter of HIS SALARY.\n2. [i]Starship Dave[/i] - coming soon to a theater near you. Eddie Murphy plays a human spacecraft. And nobody learned anything from this. \n \nAnyway, here's a list of the films to make less than 10% of their budget back that I haven't seen:\n \n[i]Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker[/i]\n[i]Basic Instinct 2[/i]\n[i]Bee Season[/i]\n[i]Bloodrayne[/i]\n[i]The Bridge of San Luis Rey[/i]\n[i]The Caveman's Valentine[/i]\n[i]Cradle Will Rock[/i]\n[i]Dirty[/i]\n[i]D-Tox[/i]\n[i]The Game of Their Lives[/i]\n[i]Heaven's Gate[/i]\n[i]It's All Gone Pete Tong[/i]\n[i]Lolita [/i](1997)\n[i]Love's Labour's Lost[/i]\n[i]Manderlay[/i]\n[i]Mimi's First Time[/i]\n[i]Monument Ave.[/i]\n[i]My Big Fat Independent Movie[/i]\n[i]No Good Deed[/i]\n[i]Nomad[/i] - which made .002% of it's budget back, which I think is pretty terrible.\n[i]The OH in Ohio[/i]\n[i]Pirates[/i] (Polanski)\n[i]Ride with the Devil[/i]\n[i]Scorched[/i]\n[i]Shade[/i]\n[i]Slow Burn[/i]\n[i]A Sound of Thunder[/i]\n[i]The Statement[/i]\n[i]Swept Away [/i](2002)\n[i]Town & Country[/i]\n[i]Waterloo[/i]\n[i]Zyzzyx Road[/i] - which made .0015% of its budget back. Which is officially the LOW point. It made exactly [b][u]$30.00[/u][/b]",

It landed with a resounding thud. The production budget was more than $100 million. The movie grossed less than $5 million domestically. Ouch. The film has a terrific supporting cast, including Rosario Dawson, Peter Boyle, Pam Grier, John Cleese and Jay Mohr. The premise concerned Murphy's character searching the universe for the culprit who destroyed his intergalactic nightclub. A repeated joke in the trailer about Hillary Clinton's face being on American currency sealed the deal. Nothing about the film was funny and it was a terrible idea to begin with.",

It wasn't because of the cheesy acting (which is standard for many of these Bruckheimer-inspired \"blockbusters\"), it wasn't because of the sci-fi theme, it wasn't anything actually about the movie. It was the premise. For some reason, I just don't really care about another night-club/theme-park/restaurant/gym/random-building owner who is getting bought out by the faceless conglomerate.\n \n The plot has been done a thousand times, and a thousand times better, but Pluto Nash came off to me as a sincere movie. I mean sincere, like they really put some thought and stayed up late nights to work out all those small details that make the movie worth watching. Pacing is also decent, with fresh action and situations keeping the movie moving. Static, cliched characters just add to that kind of cheesy vibe going through out the movie, which I wasn't sure whether it was purposeful camp or embarrasing seriousness.\n \n Either way, Pluto Nash is a cliched but acceptable little romp through space.",

It goes before they orginal into how the met and then starts to fill in some of the holes in the orginal.\r\n\r\nThe orginal cast is back, Matthew Brodrick plays Simba again. Nathan Lane does the voice of Timon and Ernie Sabella is Pumbaa. Natahan Lane if I had to guess who the voice was I would without a doubt say Billy Crystal, the first time you watch this or the first 2 Lion Kings without knowing who the actor is you would think the same. They sound ALOT alike. Theres not much you can say about these types of movies. This movie has more comedy then the others because well the only ones that made the other movies have some what of humor to it is Timon and Pumbaa. Bradley Raymond which I have nothing good to say about him so I'll leave it at that. Tom Rogers wrote the screenplay and same goes with him just like Bradley. \r\n\r\nThe way I see it is if your going to review movies, dont just review certain genres, pick a variety of movies, my mom wanted to see it so that was another reason I got it. But, its not a bad movie, its not one you would catch me watching over and over and over. For a kids movie its decent, as all kids movies they slip some adult humor in there that will go right over the kids heads. Either that or they think it means something entirely different then it does. Anyways, I wouldn't go rent this movie, if it comes on HBO then sure why not go and check it out. \r\n\r\n[SIZE=4][U][B]The Adventues of Pluto Nash [/B] [/U] [/SIZE] \r\n\r\nThis movie is a futuristic movie about a man who is struggling to keep some guys from buying the club that he owns, which is the best on the planet...or umm..technically moon. \r\n\r\nRon Underwood directed this HORRIBLE movie, which he has some good movies like Tremors and City Slickers and I won't go no further. Seeing no others were any good or I havent seen because they look stupid as this one did, but it was on HBO today and I was bored, so i watched it. Neil Cuthbert wrote the script, also he wrote Mystery Men, a movie that I think will suck but I do want to see. \r\n\r\nEddie Murphy adds quite a bit of comedy but that doesnt help with the storyline, or any of the TERRIBLE ACTING. Eddie Murphys acting wasnt that great as he can be, he had good jokes but not the acting. Randy Quaid had a few good moments. Theres some pretty good actors in it like Jay Mohr, Joe Pantaliano, Alec Baldwin has a cameo. You got John Cleese, Luis Guzman. Altogether theres 4 hilarious comedians,but that didnt help out ANYTHING. \r\n\r\nYou want a few laughs sure why not watch the movie, but the laughs arent worth it, they are limited. This is barely HBO materieal for when you're really bored. If you havent noticed I got 4 classifications I put my movies in: 1) Theatrical, 2) Rental, 3)HBO, 4)NEVER EVER WATCH THIS MOVIE (AKA-House of the Dead). Die-hard Eddie Murphy fans check it out, but his career is dropping, hes getting more of a kids person, like Dr. Dolittle, Daddy Day Care, The Haunted Mansion, which all were good except Haunted Mansion which I won't watch because it looks terrible. Anyways go with what you think.\r\n\r\n[U][B][SIZE=6]Movie News [/SIZE] [/B] [/U] \r\n\r\n[U][B][SIZE=4]Robert Rodreguez got people in mind for 'Sin City'[/SIZE][/B][/U]\r\n\r\nThe amazing director Robert Rodriquez has targeted a few big stars to star in his next movie called 'Sin City' an adapatation of the graphic novel series by Frank Miller.\r\nThe cast he has in mind is: Leonard DiCaprio, Bruce Willis, Elijah Wood, Mickey Rourke, Brittany Murphy, Kate Bosworth and Jamie King. Some are signed on some are in talks and some just recieved the offer. Benicio Del Tory and Maria Belo's names are floating around as well. The film will film shortly, and will be about 3 intertwining vignettes revoling around a dark set of characters that call the fictional corrupt town home.",

A movie that defines a generation and wins tons and tons of awards for its wit, its profoundness, and its heart.\n \nThe Adventures of Pluto Nash is not one of those movies. \n \nGod, GOD! This movie sticks on ice. \n \nEddie Murphy plays the title character, a man who owns a nightclub on the moon in the far future who is being pressured to sell his club to lunar gangsters so they can turn it into a casino. I guess it\u0092s fitting that this movie takes place on the moon since both are so vacuous. \n \nThis movie is about as fun as three months of math camp, about as funny as as watching a kid in a wheelchair get hit by a car, and if you\u0092re stupid enough to spend eight bucks to see this horrible thing, you should immediately loose your right to vote. \n \nIt\u0092s just incomprehensible how a movie this bad could be made in the first place. I mean, didn\u0092t anyone see any red flags with this thing sometime during its development? \n \nBoy, this movie is rank. Comparing it to any other bad movie would be doing the other bad movie a severe injustice and I would probably get sued for libel if I did. \n \nLet\u0092s just say that The Adventures of Pluto Nash deserved to loose every penny of the 90 million it lost on its disastrous opening weekend. \n \nI\u0092ve got to stop going to these kind of movies just to see if they\u0092re as bad as everyone says they are.",
