    "summary": "The year is 1893 and India is under British occupation. In a small village, the tyrannical Captain Russell (Paul Blackthorne) has imposed an unprecedented land tax on its citizens. Outraged, Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), a rebellious farmer, rallies the villagers to publicly oppose the tax. Russell offers a novel way to settle the dispute: he challenges Bhuvan and his men to a game of cricket, a sport completely foreign to India. If Bhuvan and his men can defeat Russell's team, the tax will be repealed.",

I've really not seen a ton of non-English movies but I'd always assumed that the low budgets (in US dollars) that most Bollywood movies had would mean they were never of particularly high quality; this one proved me completely wrong. My impression was that all of the actors, even the ones in the background, were really experienced and had rehearsed each scene thoroughly, a sure sign of the country having a more-established film industry than others. Everything was a lot more polished than the year's Oscar winner from Bosnia had been, for example. The musical numbers started spontaneously and gave the feeling that a real joie-de-vivre was hiding in each person dealing with the drought and tax problems, though I didn't find the song lyrics particularly uplifting or interesting. Aamir had serious screen presence and his mom was particularly good too. I still don't understand cricket though!",

Oh and all the ladies love him. \n\nDoes this sound cheesy and cliche? Well it surprisingly works. The film has a sincerity that is rare in Hollywood these days but still seems to be alive and well in Bollywood.\n\nThe biggest strength of Lagaan is the collection of religiously diverse characters coming together. They all have their strengths and quirks and each get a moment to shine (though poor Ismail gets the short end of that wicket). Again, the cheesiness of these moments is covered up by the earnestness of the performances. You'll love this team.\n\nOverall, this film was tons of fun and everything has a payoff so it wraps up nicely. Which is another thing that is missing from much of Hollywood.",

It tells the fictional story of a group of Indian villagers being challenged to a high-stake cricket match by their British colonizers. If the villagers win, they won't have to pay their annual land tax for 3 years. If they lose, the tax will be increased three-fold. The cricket match is so well directed that people who don't know anything about the sport will leave understanding the game. Yes, it is a Bollywood film and there are songs, and some people don't like this. But the songs are great, and the film should not be dismissed for such a banal reason.

Those audiences would have also miss one of the best musical and the best Cricket movie ever made.\n\nOnce Upon A Time In India is about the people of a small village in Victorian India stake their future on a game of cricket against their ruthless British rulers. On paper the plot could have easily failed, but in execution it works better than you might expect. For starter the film introduces it setup excellent and slowly introduces our main character building both development and engaging the audiences with these characters. The film length work towards it advantage making the journey are the more powerful when we see our heroes in their darkest of time as well as their triumphant moments. Most of all the plot is inspirational as it plot has characters as to overcome overwhelming odds to save their province. The film contains a good amount of musical numbers which serve it purpose of moving the plot while also adding a much added sense of drama to a scene. The musical numbers never takes away any momentum the plot has even during it most serious moments. As a whole it contains a nice balance of comedy, drama, and well handle love romance story. This film also accomplish the impossible task of making Cricket feel intense, exciting, and most importantly watchable for a long duration. The Cricket game is among one of the intense experience I ever went through with anything sport related in a movie ever. The plot might not sound like much on paper to most audiences, but give it a chance and you'll find yourself engaged with the film has to offer.\n\nAamir Khan makes for an excellent leading man in this musical of epic proportion. He completely dedicated to his role that you'll be convince all the way through with who he portrays. He says his lines with such passion and emotion making his every one of his speeches powerful. Gracy Singh is a lovely actress who can hold her own weight and dances gracefully in the musical numbers. The rest of the cast members not only make strong actors, but they also make excellent singers and dances in the musical numbers. The cinematography gives you a sense of scope and pulls you into its atmosphere. Weather it is showcasing its beautiful landscape or nicely choreographed musical numbers will have your eyes thrill. The musical score is terrific all the way through, especially during the Cricket which helps it add tension to an already tense climax. \n\nOnce A Upon A Time In India is filled with engaging characters, a great inspirational plot that balances many different elements, and imagery that's just stunning all the way through. It's unlike many other musicals you'll ever see and it's worth sitting over three hours if a film is this good.",
