    "summary": "The story of a man (Matt Damon), salvaged, near death, from the ocean by an Italian fishing boat. When he recuperates, the man suffers from total amnesia, without identity or background... except for a range of extraordinary talents in fighting, linguistic skills and self-defense that speak of a dangerous past. He sets out on a desperate search-assisted by the initially rebellious Marie (Franka Potente) - to discover who he really is, and why he's being lethally pursued by assassins.",

            "content": "It's a fun action flick that I've revisited many times.  Upon watching it again recently however, the flaws in the story have become more pronounced to me; Bourne's identity crisis reads as more and more sophomoric the older I get.  The man doesn't know what his real identity is, so he gets an unsuspecting bystander involved in his violent escapade?  Upon watching with a more critical eye than I had as a teenager when this was first released, Bourne's relationship with Marie strains credulity.  Why would she, a seemingly sophisticated albeit down-on-her-luck bohemian, trust every word from the deranged and violent Bourne?  To help him overcome his angsty existential crisis?  Really?  On the positive side, Greengrass certainly brought it when it comes to the action sequences and the camerawork, and this film revolutionized the stale Action genre when it was released twenty years ago.  If you are able to overlook the glaring problems in the story (as I was able to for twenty years), turn off your mind and go along for the ride, you will certainly enjoy it. 3.5-4 stars.",

He'll never be top \"A\" list actor but he does a good job in movies like these and makes them fun and interesting. I enjoyed the job he did. Clive Owen almost stole the seen from him the part where Clive got shot and died. You can see why Clive Owen shoot up in fame so fast after this movie. lol Oops or maybe not. Clive Owen needs to get out of actions Movies but back this one. I really like the Bourne Movies Matt Damon though he's not a top \"A\" list actor does a good job stead of making interesting Movies and he picks good Directors or fairly good ones. Kind of like Tom Cruise, they both have what takes to make an good fun movie but never something great but maybe who knows, great surprises have happened. Just look at Sylvester Stallone, he once had it but what he did with it who knows, maybe to many head punches and to much paint fumes, again who knows?",

            "content": "I like the hand held camera work at times, it gives it a more intense realistic feeling. That CIA sector of the building looks kind of sad and drab lol. All those old outdated big tube computers. I guess it makes sense though since it's the early 2000's. I like how they tried to make it seem like he had disappeared when the two people and the car passed in front of the camera but you could see his red jacket poking out from behind the car lol. I thought that was funny. They were trying to be slick lol. The plot and story is fascinating. The movie definitely looks kind of dated lol, but it's got a solid style. I love the fresh spin on the secret agent genre in this movie, it feels original. I really liked the way they showed Jason finding all of his belongings in the Swiss bank, discovering who he really is and what he does. It's not like James Bond movies where everything is flashy. This is about an agent who's trying to figure out what's going on and what happened to him. It's more grounded in reality. \n\nI liked seeing the relationship blossom between Jason and Marie. Also really nice how the whole story develops and unfolds. How we see all these characters that are connected to one another with Wombosi, the CIA guy, the blonde chick in Paris and Jason. Wow, she let him cut her actual hair, that's crazy lol. The Wombosi guy is funny. The actor who plays him did a hilariously good job, he's definitely got comedic chops. It's kind of funny seeing the CIA try and clean up the mess left by Jason. That explosion at the countryside house was no joke, you could see the snow scatter off the logs of wood from the shockwave. I like the characters that Clive Owens plays, they always have some depth to them.\n\nDo these guys from the CIA seriously think they're being sneaky? Lmao, the earpiece is literally sticking out of their shirt and they look so obviously undercover. And they expect Jason not to notice this? Lol what?! So shocking seeing how Jason couldn't pull the trigger on Wombosi because his kids were there with him. His human side kicked in and he couldn't go through with the mission. In a way, him getting shot in the back and left in the middle of the ocean is kind of a way for him being given another chance, to start new, to be reborn. It's crazy how an organization can take out one of their own men if they feel it's necessary, like what they did with the CIA guy at the end, and nobody bats an eye. \n\nEqual parts exciting, suspenseful and intense. It never felt boring or dull. The plot development is fantastic.  There's some very funny ironic and also unironic moments throughout the movie as well. There's certain things that happen throughout the movie that make it feel kind of silly but it gets a pass since it's the early 2000's. Overall, really solid and well-crafted action thriller. I totally recommend it.",

Ultimately, it manages to appeal to a wide audience, by being a smart thriller, an exciting action flick, an intriguing romance and a well-crafted character study.\n\nThe personalities and motivations of the antagonists could have been explored more, but the globally solid screenplay and brilliant acting abundantly make up for it.",

            "content": "I first saw The Bourne Identity 17 years ago. I've had vague memories of the plot since that viewing - all I remember was being touched by the idea of ​​a secret government agent having lost his memory, and also really enjoying Matt Damon's acting. For the next viewing, I sat down in a mysterious anticipation: I was very afraid that I would not like the film, but at the same time I hoped that I would experience the same emotions as five years ago. It turned out that \"The Bourne Identity\" is not one of those films, the opinion of which changes in the opposite direction over the years. The action movie not only withstood the test of strength with the second viewing, it remained the same mysterious, and therefore terribly interesting spectacle - from the beginning to the very last minute.\n\nI have no doubt that many watch action movies for the sake of beautiful shootouts and brawls, that is, for the soul, in order to unload themselves, for example, after a hard day / week and just relax. Actually, why play around - and I belong to this number. But - here's the problem! - when watching \"The Bourne Identity\" you completely forget about these shootouts, chases and other madness that is typical for militants. I will say more: you pay direct attention to the local story, if you pay attention to anything at all.\n\nThe plot is what makes the movie worth watching. Moreover: imbued with the situation in which the main character, in fact, Bourne, got into, I really don't want all these shootings and other \"tinsel\" characteristic of militants. Thus, \"The Bourne Identification\" is an unusual and contented specific spectacle that, somewhere on a subconscious level, resonates in the soul. I don't even know what I would have given the film those mentioned five years ago, but I'm sure that it deserves a high rating.\n\nFinally, back to Matt Damen. It can be seen that the actor was preparing for the role of Jason Bourne, he probably found out what happens to people who have lost their memory, tried to portray it. It looks, you know, nowhere more convincing, although I am not a special expert on this part. Therefore, the film turned out to be very lively, real-life. Of course, some moments spoil the atmosphere, but if you close your eyes to minor roughness, then in general, The Bourne Identity is not just a watchable film, but one that every movie buff should watch. You may not like The Bourne Identity, but you will find out for yourself that there are action movies that try to take it with the plot.",

            "content": "An exhilarating and original thriller like no other!\n\nDoug Liman's espionage thriller The Bourne Identity (2002) is a groundbreaking political thriller of assassinations and cover-ups with a gripping story from Robert Ludlum. Liman's direction is genuinely shocking, creative, and enthralling as he takes you around Europe for visceral action like you've never seen before. The Bourne Identity influenced every action sequence and hand to hand combat choreography scene after it for a reason. The quickfire punches and kicks coupled with kills with household objects is insane to watch Jason Bourne kill at will. Liman truly influenced every action movie after him, which is no small feat.\n\nLudlum's story is a riveting espionage tale about botched assassinations, intricate government overseas operations, and sleeper agent killers just waiting for an assignment. Combining the curious intrigue of an assassination with amnesia and federally sanctioned murders, The Bourne Identity starts out an endlessly entertaining espionage narrative over the course of the trilogy. I love the end theme from Moby as well. It's iconic and synonymous with the series with good reason.\n\nMatt Damon is engaging as Jason Bourne. His frustrated condition from his memory loss is sympathetic, his action prowess is undeniable, and his decent hearted hero is endearing. Jason Bourne may very well be not only Damon's best character, but The Bourne Identity may be his greatest film. He is just unforgettable whether he's killing men with pens or convincing his love interest to run away with him.\n\nFranka Potente is wonderful here as an innocent victim of circumstance who falls in love with Bourne and his magnetic charisma and obvious skill. His decency and gentle nature make Bourne likable, but interesting for Potente to act opposite. She's sympathetic as a character, but Potente is empathetic for the audience to experience her journey alongside Bourne. I love how Franka Potente just seems so genuine and sweet in this world of killers seeking hits.\n\nChris Cooper is perfect as the government head of Treadstone. He plays ferocious and callous very well with an effortless fervor. Brian Cox is reserved, yet memorable as the man behind the shadows. I like Julia Stiles as the fixer for Treadstone, who is in over her head. Clive Owen is the star supporting role as the hitman called The Professor. His focused sniping is scary, but his duel with Damon in the field is legendary already.\n\nOverall, The Bourne Identity is original and exhilarating. You will love this movie forever.",

            "content": "?'THE BOURNE IDENTITY' was directed by Doug Liman, stars Matt Damon, Franka Potente and Chris Cooper and is the story of a man(Matt Damon) who is found stranded in the ocean with no knowledge of who he is. The only things he can remember are his enhanced ability to kill. As events unfold, he discovers who he is and why he why he didn't know who he was.\n\nI went into this movie with skyrocketed expectations. That may have tainted my viewing but I just don't understand the sheer praise sent this movie's way. Sure Damon was pretty good and the action was pretty entertaining but aside from that, there is little more enjoyment to be found here. The Bourne Disappointment contains enough to be watchable but not enough to the point I can recommend it. Damon is, to be fair, pretty good as the star character but I don't think its the role he SHOULD be remembered for. The action is also decent but it doesn't hold to the standard that I've heard so many people praise it for. If you enjoy this movie, fine. But don't come to me and praise it as a gritty, realistic spy thriller that changed action movies because it just isn't. It's fine.\n\nRight, the story for this movie has a genuine level of intrigue and I can understand it is more grounded in reality than say Bond, or Mission Impossible. That said, I don't think that it is interesting enough to make it better than what it is. While the story is fine it's not great and could have been done much better, especially considering the concept. Pretty disappointing to be honest.\n\nAgain, Matt Damon is the only genuinely great thing in this movie for me. I don't think it should be the role people recognise him for but I do genuinely buy both the confused side of his character and the badass side of his character. Franke Potente was, on the other hand, awful as Marie Krutz. She was more wooden than a tree and possessed no likable or redeeming qualities that made me care in any way. One thing this movie was praised for is the 'chemistry' between Bourne and Krutz. How? Where is their chemistry? An ant and the heel of my sneaker have more chemistry. Jesus and Judas have better chemistry than these two. Hitler and a homosexual Jewish man have better chemistry. They have no chemistry and I challenge you to prove me otherwise. Chris Cooper existed and was there. The villain was very weak.\n\nTechnically speaking, this movie was fine. The use of shaky cam and Liman's breaking of things such as the 180 rule definitely benefited this movie and sold the idea of realism and grittiness. The effects were also fine but thankfully they weren't used consistently.\n\nI do like how neither us(the audience) or Bourne actually understand the character of Bourne. I think the dynamic of that is clever and works well in the context of the movie. \n\nIn conclusion, this movie is honestly just average. Some action is good and Damon was good as Bourne but I just can't see enough substance to keep this movie better than what it is. I don't think it deserves the immense praise it gets and I think it's fine. I don't recommend it but if you like it, than I guess I do envy you for seeing something I just cannot.\n\n4/10",

There are many elements that fit together to form the goodness that is \"The Bourne Identity\", especially the fact that it isn't just a standard start to finish, bland plot. The plot of this movie is excellent, you start the movie knowing absolutely nothing, and as it unfolds, and as we gain more information the unpredictability of it doesn't get too complicated to ruin the movie, but it makes you think, and perfectly executes the psychological impact it intended to have. I believe this was Matt Damon's second or third big hit movie, coming right after \"Good Will Hunting\", and he absolutely knocked it out of the park, so much so that in 2002 people started to recognize him as Jason Bourne rather than Will Hunting. Although some of the action sequences are a little cheesy (I'm trying to do my best to keep in mind that this is the early 2000's), there were some action sequences, one in particular, that I thought was ingeniously executed, and set the stage for  thrilling scene. I thoroughly enjoyed what \"The Bourne Identity\" had to offer, and this probably deserves 4 stars, but I had to give it 3 1/2, only because that was my first instinct (but it was extremely close).

Yes for once in the genre, 'The Bourne Identity' has a story that moves forward and flows - smartly focusing on our main character's journey rather than getting bogged down by petty politics. This attention to Bourne himself is what really hooks you, and that's helped not only by the brilliant writing, but also by Matt Damon's magnetic performance that makes the character feel so real. In fact, this whole movie feels as grounded as Bourne does, and huge credit should be given to the film's stylistic choices on that one. I just love the hand-held cinematography and the thriller elements that are incorporated by the lighting and score, and in the end it all amalgamates to a real on-the-ground feeling and a sense of edge-of-the-seat engagement that had become quite rare for a film of this type.\nWHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Despite the fact it flips the coin a bit on the government side of things, you can't get away from the fact it all feels a little cliched.\nVERDICT: This will become a phrase I use to describe all the Bourne films; 'what it does, it does best.'

It's scope, technicality and characterization was unprecedented, what starts off as a mystery of an American discovered at sea with only a few clues to spare eventually turns into the plot of a spy assassin on the run from those who trained him. Matt Damon became the unexpected action hero at the time, able to pull off daring stunts taking out enemies clean and easily, as were his ability to plan strategically through many situaltions, \nall this making him the truly compelling character from Robert Ludlum's books on one of the most revered action movie franchises of the modern age. This film directed by Doug Liman may be the more genuinely character oriented films the franchise has developed, it's main plot about the character's recent history, motivation, recent relationship with supporting character, as was him discovering his identity is a little small scaled then usual, though the compelling aspect with the character and the CIA operative working behind the scenes became the most concentrated narrative strands than just the inciting incident and the character's backstory subplot. Overall it still holds up today, still a worthy introduction to a unique character and film series.",

With 4 successful films under its belt to this point, and one more on the way, Jason Bourne has become one of Hollywood's most enduring protagonists.  Luckily, after so long and many repeated viewings, The Bourne Identity still holds up.\n\nBefore Paul Greengrass came on board and gave us a few heart stopping thrill rides, Doug Liman directed the first entry in the series.  While there are a few dated stylistic choices by Liman, he did a great job kicking off the series.  It was released in 2002, but it definitely has a 90's action-thriller vibe from its look and feel.  It's also far less cinematic than its successors and in turn makes for a great cable watch (which is probably why I've seen this film north of 10 times).\n\nAs I understand, the film's budget spiraled after several reshoots and push back's, so John Powell had little to work with in terms of a natural score.  I feel like that helped him create a more grounded sound and tone to the series, as he has gone on to score 3 more Bourne films.  Powell's score, along with the great end credits Moby tag, make for one good listen.  The Bourne Identity doesn't nearly have the scope that the Greengrass films do, but it has a surprisingly amount of awareness for an action film.  The entire series is more cerebral than it gets credit for.\n\nAccompanying Matt Damon as Bourne himself, is an impressive cast that consists of German star Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Clive Owen.  Potente serves a great counter to Damon in that they both play lost souls searching for answers.  She also essentially plays the audience, who is going along with Bourne as he ventures deep into his past.  Owen, Cooper, and Cox are all great as different levels of C.I.A. agents.  Particularly, Clive Owen, who does so much with so little amount of dialogue.\n\nI'm of the belief that, besides Legacy, the Bourne films get better as the series goes on.  With a charismatic performance from Damon, in a somewhat unlikable role, it's all the more impressive just how successful these films have become.  Hopefully that continues moving forward.\n\n+Damon's commitment\n\n+Supporting cast\n\n+Powell's grounded score\n\n+Good action, but better characters\n\n-Some dated stylistic choices\n\n9.0/10",

            "content": "Considering the fact that 'Jason Bourne' is releasing later this month there has never been a better reason to talk about this incredible action franchise that introduced us to the man known as Jason Bourne. And there are some spoilers here and there but you've had plenty of time to see this film. \n\nSo here it is, the introduction to the best Action trilogy of all time and one of the strongest and most consistent trilogies to ever have existed... 'The Bourne Identity'. In this film; A man wakes to find himself in the middle of the sea with no identity and no knowledge of his past, as he is hunted down he uncovers more and more about his mysterious past and the man he used to be. This movie blended elements of Action, Mystery, Suspense, and some light Humour, all in a way that made this a very well crafted and thoroughly entertaining thrill ride. You have your exciting fast paced, grounded, action set-pieces, great characters, fantastic performances, and a touch of mystery to add another layer to what would otherwise be a basic plot. The only thing i miss when watching this film is not being able to remember my first experience with it, what i would give to see this for the first time again...\n\nLets start off with the action because when it comes to close quarters hand to hand combat, no-one is ever going to come close to overcoming Jason Bourne. His fight scenes are intense, exciting, and full of awesome brutal fast paced combat. Sometimes they briefly touch on the multiple jump cuts approach, but overall the scenes are very easy to watch. And there are so many memorable fight scenes in this film, the main one being where he fights a knife wielding assassin with a pen... a fucking pen... The guy could turn a ham sandwich into a deadly weapon if he needed to. The series constantly finds new ways to up the excitement and up the stakes in every film, and when you start with a pen fight scene, it's only up from there. Also one of my favourite shots in the trilogy, no matter how unrealistic it may seem is where Jason Bourne 'falls with style' down a shitload of flights of stairs on the back of a body, shoots a guy in the head half way down and doesn't end up a quadriplegic...\n\nMatt Damon, Chris Cooper and Brian Cox were all amazing in their roles as very different characters with very contrasting personalities. Especially today, it is hard to look at these actors and not see their countless other recognisable roles. But they play these characters so well, with so much dedication to the role that this is the role you think of when you see them in other films. Franka Potente plays a likeable character who is serviceable to the plot and acts as the love interest but wasn't overly impressive in her performance. You empathise for the character and do really get behind her for sticking with Jason Bourne considering the mess she has been dragged into, but it wasn't the strongest performance in the film. She does have a good amount of chemistry with Bourne and compliments his rather blank expression rather well throughout the film. \n\nAlso what i thought this film did very well was how it handled being an individual film as well as setting up a very successful franchise. It has a fairly closed and contained story, you can walk away from this film having seen a beginning middle and end where all of the main points have been seemingly concluded. And at the same time there are small hints placed throughout the film and minor characters who don't get a full arc that elude to their presence in the sequel without making this film seem unfinished. Expertly put together if you ask me. \n\nSo that's it for this look back at the birth of Jason Bourne, the man who proves time and time again that James Bond wouldn't stand a chance in this universe. It is a fantastic all round very entertaining Action Thriller that spawned the greatest action movie trilogy of all time. \n\n8/10",

            "content": "The Bourne Identity is a movie going adventure that makes going to theaters absolutely necessary. Doug Liman's film stars Matt Damon as Jason Bourne or at least the audience knows that. The film follows a man who is found in the middle of the ocean by a ship and finds out that he can't remember anything including his name. Once he gets dropped off on the Paris shore, he soon discovers that a bunch of men are hunting him down and the rest is a wild chase to find out his true identity. The film has a good cast consisting of talents like the cute copilot played by Franka Potente and the evil control freak Conklin played by Chris Cooper. Jason Bourne is an interesting guy because he doesn't know what his purpose really is and why people are hunting him down. This gives the film so much suspense and entertainment value that it works seamlessly well. The action scenes are filmed with camera work ease and provides multiple perspectives to a fight or wide angle shot. The action as a whole is an incredible spectral. Bourne is able to make a convincing fight with a ballpoint pen for God sakes! The car chases are intense given that the stakes are high from great character development too. The final battle on the stairway was also incredibly scary and nerve wrecking. Speaking of development though, Jason and Maria had good chemistry and buildup for each other but I felt like their relationship was just GOOD, not great or anything special. There could've been more personal moments thrown in there but their togetherness was purely just cute. Bourne's mystery is by far the highlight of the film. We go for his perspective too because like him we start the film with no previous memory or concept of what he's capable of doing. The editing only makes it more thrilling and engaging because of the quick cuts and 360 degree shots. There's so much to be commended about this film's style because with this substance there's a lot of style. The choreography was stylish and sleek like a real fight that could be happening. The last act of this film proved why it's vital to pay attention to dialogue too because you can kinda lost in translation during the finale. Not that the character speech isn't exciting or anything but it's actually interesting to follow and makes the movie much more than just action scenes. That's what's great about The Bourne Identity, it's smarter than your average action Hollywood garbage. It's a ton of fun and actually makes you feel smart after the run time too. The Bourne Identity is a great thriller that opens up a new world for the character of Bourne. He's smart, clever, and daresay kinda scary! I can't wait to see the next of Jason and his other assignments. A-",

The ever-present sense of mystery and conspiracy as Bourne searches for answers make all the difference.  The action is also highly innovative and suspenseful, although the ending is kind of anticlimactic when compared to the exciting action that precedes it.\n\nBut the greatest asset of \"The Bourne Identity\" is its lead, Matt Damon.  Damon takes complete control of the screen.  Daman has proven himself a capable action star in several ensemble action films, so I'm glad to see him get the chance to lead his own film.\n\nMy biggest problem with \"The Bourne Identity\" is that it doesn't feel like it completely resolves Bourne's story, and I'm going to hold the film accountable for that.  It doesn't fully explain how he got his amnesia or how he got his skills, and with Brian Cox's character still alive, it's still likely that he'll be pursued.  Even if loose ends were intentionally left for a possible sequel, there should have been more closure than there is.\n\nSequel of no sequel, \"The Bourne Identity\" is an excellent action film.

            "content": "The first time I watched the Bourne films I watched all 3 back-to-back in one night. As a result I've often had a hard time differentiating one from another and rating each of them accurately. In this revisit I vowed to watch each one with a decent amount of time between them so I have a more clear perception of which parts of the film work and which parts don't. I should also say that, I didn't particularly like these movies, so it's a miracle I even decided to do this. With all that said, I thought The Bourne Identity was a really excellent film. The entire concept of an assassin who has lost his memory is fascinating. He has those killer instincts, but has no idea why. It was just enthralling watching Bourne muddle through the clues trying to piece together who he is and what he should do. The action scenes were intense and well-executed, but this isn't really an action film. Instead this is a character film that reflects the theme spelled out in its title...\"Identity.\" I like the idea that, separated from his memories, Bourne is led to question what really defines him.\n\nNaturally any time you have a trained killer as your protagonist you have to send some people to try and kill him, which creates all the conflict in the story. Chris Cooper is a good actor to play the head of \"Treadstone\" because he speaks with authority, but you also can believe he might be kind of slimy. Clive Owen is also great as one of the assassins sent to dispatch Bourne. In fact, in many ways, I would call The Bourne Identity a superb masterpiece and rate it up with some of the best of the Bond films. However there is one key piece that holds this movie back. Matt Damon is just awful! He is completely unconvincing as an action hero, and has the emotional depth of a damp rag. I want to go on this tough emotional journey with him, but he plays every single beat as flat as the next. I get more emotional cues from the music than I do from his face. Frankly I didn't think Franka Potente was much better, but she at least was good at playing the shock of seeing these awful things happening right in front of her. Luckily the story carries this film beyond Matt Damon's performance. I applaud the film makers for making The Bourne Identity into a slick film that kept me thoroughly entertained from start to finish. It must have been a real challenge considering the lead actor they had to work around.",

He evades the CIA with a gritty determination that has the viewer intrigued by his next move. Phenomenal chase and fight scenes make this a must see movie.",

Bourne is rescued from the Mediterranean sea with a microchip and two bullet wounds in his back, once the chip activates it leads to a bank in Zurich. When Bourne awakes he realises he is suffering from memory loss, and now his adventure starts leading him to discover who he is and what happened before his rescue. This is not a slow film, it just makes you wait a while before erupting into action, and Doug Liman does a fantastic job of isolating Bourne from his surroundings and placing threat all around him, uncertainty looms in the air and tension is thick and that's what replaces action. However Liman puts you in the passenger seat when the thrills begin, the car chase is frantic and well edited, fast cuts leap from shot to shot with grit and realism, there's no gimmicks and the stunt work is real, and when you've got Paul Oakenfold's 'Ready, Steady, Go\" soundtrack playing alongside you know you're in for a full on ride. Matt Damon and Franka Potente are two excellent leads, when they have to act suspicious and at times reserved they do it so well, and their characters develop as the franchise extends into other adventures. Without blistering action and more focus on story this is a top spy thriller and the start to a brilliant franchise.",

Damon may not be the best actor in the world, but I thought he was excellent for this part, and he was surrounded with a great cast. This is the definition of a popcorn flick with entertainment all around. Bottom line, this movie will entertain you if you have any sense at all... I'd recommend this film, and this entire franchise, to everyone.",

The characters have a certain depth to them, and even though their psychological profile is not complex, it is well done. The camera work is incredible. The theme song is good. The action and editing are tight, and the details all work out logically.\n\nMatt Damon definitely plays one of his best role and gets you right into Bourne's skin. Franka Potente is just right as his lead female, You want to slap Chris Cooper's character, almost from the very start. Julia Stiles has a small role but at the time, it was a mature one for her. And Brian Cox wraps it up quite nicely, while the rest of the crew doesn't disappoint a single time.\n\nNow, the few little points I found that did work for me. The night sea shots look like a set. Terrible. Fortunately, you only see a few. The dictator is a bit over the top. And finally, the car would never have made it down those steps in driving condition, but that's a common movie mistake.

He finds a microfilm planted in his leg containing the number of a Swiss bank account and ultimately learns that he is Jason Bourne, CIA operative. \r\n\r\nMost of the movie follows Bourne as he tries to reclaim his life and survive a number of attempts to kill him. He soon realizes he's being hunted down by assassins and that he's very good at killing them before they get him as we are taken from the Mediterranean to Zurich, Paris and Berlin.  There is an clandestine conspiracy within the CIA -- this is a Robert Ludlum story after all --  and the  requisite character traits:  waking up to discover you were able to speak half a dozen languages, had tens of thousands in a Swiss bank account and could out-fight Bruce Lee, and a number of well done car chase scenes.\r\n\r\nThis movie was much more violent and action packed and Matt Damon was a better choice to play Bourne than the 1988 mini series starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith.  I guess if you wanted to do a miniseries in the 1980s, Chamberlain and Smith were the default choices for the lead roles.",

Of course, \"Supremacy\" and \"Ultimatum\" packed in more of a visceral punch towards its action sequences, but what \"Identity\" did was build a narrative foundation that the rest of the iterations could build upon. And what a foundation it is. There seemingly doesn't seem to be a dull moment in this clever but bold action thriller. Doug Liman is definitely lacking in terms of technicalities compared to Paul Greengrass (evidently shown in many of the fight scenes and the mini cooper chase sequence), but \"Identity\" still stands up there with the likes of the many exceptional espionage films. Plus, it has one of the most memorable spy vs. spy, wits vs. wits action scenes involving Damon and Clive Owen.\n\n\"The Bourne Identity\". It's a must watch and a hell of a good time.",
