    "summary": "Male nurse Benigno (Javier Cámara) becomes infatuated with a complete stranger when he watches dancer Alicia (Leonor Watling) practicing from the anonymity of his apartment. After being injured in a car accident, Alicia is brought to a nearby hospital, where Benigno serendipitously happens to be her caregiver. When wounded bullfighter Lydia (Rosario Flores) is brought into the same ward, her companion, writer Marco (Darío Grandinetti), begins to bond with Benigno.",

Its touching and poignant at times but its not entirely a sentimental film - there is some sexual content, mainly nudity present, which may put people off. Its a thoughtful film, with good characters - I liked the characterisation and I found it charming how the two men, who find themselves in similar situations (i.e. their other half is in a coma), get along and perhaps begrudgingly support themselves.\n\nIt is a somewhat arty film at times, with one scene depicting a silent film (in black and white), which I found a bit uncomfortable due to the nudity aspect in it. This seemed to me a quite thoughtful, even somewhat philosophical, film, one I really enjoyed by the end. I like that it wasn't too cliched/'Hollywood', not shying away from some gritty plot aspects. This is a film I'd definitely recommend (even the traditional Spanish (Flamenco style?) music played as the credits rolled was lovely but it won't necessarily be suitable for all.",

            "content": "Talk to Her has elicited some strong responses over the years, mostly centering around outrage generated by Javier Cámara's Benigno. While you could justifiably criticize Almodóvar for baiting the audience with this character - building up a caring persona before committing a truly horrific act - interpretations that are based around some perceived sympathy for Benigno seem somewhat simplistic. He is patently delusional and the film makes no statement to the contrary, nor does it attempt to actually justify his motivations (though Benigno himself does that, the film has no qualms about stating that he is a monster for what he did); the character is a manifestation of social isolation taken to the extreme. In short, you are allowed use an extreme example of a theme (loneliness) and lament those that suffer from it without condoning the actions of such an individual. \n\nNow as a film, Talk to Her seems like one of the weaker Almodóvars, retaining the melodrama without employing any of the humor that he's excelled at elsewhere, making the film seem less like the mature moral quagmire that it hints at being, and instead feeling intermittently silly. Still, there is a lot to like in the production value, particularly the flashback-based narrative progression and the performances of Grandinetti and in particular Cámara. Ambitious, but the combination of the dark tone and Almodóvar's penchant for soap opera plotlines just doesn't mesh well for me. (3/5)",

Benigno is a nurse, obsessed with a dancer he sees in the studio across the street from his apartment, who is hired to take care of her when she is involved in an accident and falls into a coma.  In a parallel situation, Marco is a journalist who becomes involved with a bullfighter and spends time with her in the hospital when she is horribly gored.  It's an emotionally complex story, beautifully woven to incorporate the different forms that love can take and all stylishly filmed in a beautiful color palette.",

It is a great movie, with beautifully crafted vagueness, uncertainty and inclusiveness.  It is rather exploring and not being decisive, which I think I appreciate a lot.  The impacts come from the movie on my earlier age is critical, and the movie shapes my view of love, friendship and loneliness.  \n\nI don't, however, know whether I handle my own things smarter or not, but it does provide me a different way of thinking, observing and insisting.  None of the characters in the movie is likeable, to my two cents, they all reflect some kinds of shortcomings and weakness, and yet they are adorable for some moments. They are like fragments of mirrors, reflecting the images of our own, without persuading or leading us.  You watch it, you absorb it, and you are on your own.  ",

His best work is unpredictable, character-driven, and thought-provoking, even when leavened with comedy. Talk to Her finds Almodóvar in serious mode, following two men who care for women in comas and charting their developing relationship.  He tracks backward to show us events in their lives that led them to their current present day situation (including information that might ordinarily reduce our sympathy - but somehow not here).  Then he allows the narrative to move forward to a somewhat shocking climax (Almodóvar is never one to shy away from melodrama) and a fanciful abrupt denouement.  Along the way, the director includes a surreal \"silent film\" excerpt that sees a shrinking man climb into a giant vagina.  Well, you can't be serious all the time. He also shows us the similarities between ballet and bullfighting (copping some flak for emphasising the latter), with a guest role for Geraldine Chaplin as a dance instructor.  Despite the sometimes jarring changes in tone, everything holds together and the resulting feeling is that we have been exposed to real life in all of its sometimes problematic weirdness, sadness and joy.",

            "content": "During a performance of Café Müller, a dance-theatre piece by Pina Bausch, Benigno Martín (Javier Cámara) and Marco Zuluaga (Darío Grandinetti) cross paths, but the two men are no more than strangers. Still, Benigno notices that Marco cries. Marco is a journalist and travel writer, who happens to see a TV interview with Lydia González (Rosario Flores), a famous female matador. He thinks that an article on her would be interesting and, on the instructions of his editor, he contacts her in a bar, where she asks him to take her to her house. As they talk, she elaborates on the fact that she broke up with her boyfriend \"el Niño de Valencia\", another matador, something that has been all over the tabloids. As Marco confesses that he knows nothing of bullfighting and that he is a journalist, she becomes angry and leaves his car without saying a word. As he drives off, he hears a scream inside her house and stops; Lydia rushes off and climbs back into his car: she asks him to kill a snake that she found in her house. He does so and comes out of the house crying. With that new confidence established between them, they become friends and, later on, lovers. Marco attends a wedding in Toledo and is surprised to find Lydia there too, since she had said that she did not want to go. The wedding turns out to be that of Marco's former fiancée, Angela, who had the same phobia of snakes as Lydia; Marco was very much in love with Angela and had a very hard time getting over her (which was the reason for his constant crying over things he could not share with her). Lydia says that she has something important to say, but she prefers to wait until after the bullfight that afternoon; but she is gored and becomes comatose. Marco does not leave her side at the hospital and finally befriends Benigno, who recognizes him from the dance-theatre performance. Marco is told by the doctors that people in a coma never wake up and that, while there are miracle-stories of people who have come back, he should not keep his hopes high. Benigno is a personal nurse and caregiver for Alicia Roncero (Leonor Watling), a beautiful dance student, who lies in a coma, but Benigno sees her as alive; he talks his heart out to her, and brings her all kinds of dancing and silent black and white film mementos. As it turns out, Benigno had been obsessed with Alicia for a while, before she was in a coma, since his apartment is in front of the dance studio where she practiced every day. At first his obsession was only from a distance, since Benigno was taking care of his possessive mother, who seemed to be immobile. For that reason, he became a nurse and also a beautician. Free to move about after his mother dies, he finally picks up the courage to talk to Alicia, after she dropped her wallet on the street. As they walk together to her house, they talk about her discovery of silent black and white films and about dancing. When she walks into her building, Benigno notices that she lives in the house of Dr Roncero, who is a psychiatrist. Benigno makes an appointment to see the doctor and talks about his unresolved bereavement grief over his mother. But it is all a ruse to gain access to the apartment, where he steals a hair-clip from Alicia's room. That night, Alicia is run over by a car and becomes comatose. By mere chance, Benigno is assigned to Alicia, much to the surprise of her father. But since Benigno's services are the best, he hires him and a colleague permanently to tend for Alicia. Benigno also tells Dr. Roncero that he is homosexual, possibly so that Alicia's father won't suspect his love for her, or possibly so that he won't question Benigno's particular attachment to her. The lives of Benigno, Marco, Lydia and Alicia flows in all directions, past, present and future, dragging all of them towards an unsuspected destiny...\n\n\"Hable con Ella\" became a huge success when it came out, and despite the fact that we have a plot line based on classic Almodóvar turf such as deeply dark desires and actions taken from those desires, the pace and production development is a bit \"slow\" and not \"exploding\" in a normal Almodóvar way with over the top dialogue and character studies. He focus on male loneliness and longing, which in one way is a topic we rarely see on the screen, or at least in this sort of format and shape and that has its value. Javier Cámara, Darío Grandinetti. Rosario Flores and Leonor Watling perform with true passion and dedication, and I do like the fact that Almodóvar adds bullfighting and the myth of the matador in the mix as he did in \"Matador\". I did like the silent movie with the shrinking man that \"disappeared\" into his girlfriend as well. Weirdly intriguing. But, personally I didn´t become as engaged in the film as obviously so many others have, and it never really gripped me emotionally despite disturbing and harsh topics. This is not Almodóvar´s best film if you ask me.",

            "content": "If they were schoolmates during their teenaged years, Benigno (Javier Cámara) and Marco (Darío Grandinetti) would, without a doubt, not have been close.  Benigno, shy and sweet, most likely grew up friendless, acting as a teacher's pet that perhaps even the teacher didn't want moping around; Marco, a strong, silent type, feasibly hung around the art stars or the faux intellectuals, returning friendships out of obligation only to return home to process his own deep thoughts.  Presently, the former is a mama's boy all grown up and without a mother, the latter a journalist who carries a heart hardly tattered by the ruthless nitpickings that often streak across his profession.\n\tThe two meet under circumstances too horrifying to imagine: Benigno is a nurse taking care of comatose ballet student Alicia (Leonor Watling), who has been in a vegetative state for four years; Marco is the lover of bullfighter Lydia Gonzalez (Rosario Flores), who has been gored and is now brain dead.  Benigno has become infatuated with his patient, quick to admit that he loves her on several occasions, and Marco, shocked by the sudden loss of the woman he adores, sulks around as he tries to decide whether to move on with his life or not.  Dwellers of the same hospital, Marco and Benigno soon notice each other's destituteness and strike up a friendship, fused together by their similar empty devotion.\n\tMonths ago, I would have admitted to being a bigger fan of the screwball Pedro Almodóvar, a filmmaker more inclined to concoct a situational comedy with the visual style of Douglas Sirk - \"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\" would be the fuel to my fire, \"Live Flesh\" and \"The Skin I Live In\" working as additives more akin to sticks than gasoline.  But 2002's \"Talk to Her\", one of his most mature, emotionally draining works, is so painstakingly passionate it becomes difficult not to favor Almodóvar when there's a feeling that he's pouring parts of himself out onto the screen.  It showcases nearly everything he does best: his untamed eye for melodrama, his fiery regard for human sexuality, his dark sense of humor, his enviable ability to jerk tears, and his breathtaking, saturated cinematographic aptitude.  We don't just watch \"Talk to Her\"; we devour it, licking our fingers contently as tears metaphorically cascade down our cheeks.  It crams the frippery of soap opera in a different headspace and turns cheap bauble into intoxicating emotional flamboyance.\n\tAlmodóvar gives us an idea as to what kind of women Alicia and Lydia were, but he, methodically and smartly, doesn't reveal enough to let their mysterious, exhilarating personas unravel.  They are mostly kept as placeholders that allow the viewer to study the complex relationship between Benigno and Marco.  There is something eerie about their affection for these women: neither actually knows the person they're idolizing very well, but they're willing to give up a comfortable life just to care for them.  Marco stays by Lydia's bedside out of romantic responsibility, as if trying to make up for the time they never got the opportunity to spend.  Benigno's obsession, however, is a little more unsettling.  He is often willing to spend more than 24 hours with Alicia at a time, and though she cannot sense his presence, he figures that they're in love with each other.\n\tBut Almodóvar doesn't dare judge his leading characters - he analyzes the kind of men they were before and after each woman's accident, pondering just how much they've changed.  Perhaps Marco has grown more mature, more thoughtful of how he lives his life; Benigno, already emotionally unstable before he even became a nurse, is being given the chance to let his infatuations get the best of him to a dangerous extent.\n\tAlmodóvar's direction and writing bears the same sort of empathy his most poignant films possess, and yet \"Talk to Her\" is more like the sort of movie you'd expect him to make during the end of his career, retrospective and considerate in his every action.  It's ordinary by his standards.  Cámara and Grandinetti are just as stunning, Cámara making Benigno a lovable oaf until innocence becomes accidentally malicious, Grandinetti embodying the sadness of Marco while still managing to keep himself enigmatic in comparison to the easy-to-read qualities of his co-star.  Watling and Flores are devastating their few minutes of living, breathing screen time\n\tAt its core, though, \"Talk to Her\" is pure Almodóvar, heartfelt one moment and taboo the next.  There are times it resembles a surly 1950s melodrama, in others a psychological thriller.  It's a spectacular film underrated when put next to \"All About My Mother\" and \"Broken Embraces\"; it may as well be the film of Almodóvar's career.",

Is his love and caring enough to make his deeds any less a crime? No, but we wish that he could have been able to win his Alicia, never the less. And, of course, there is the sympathy we feel for Marco, who seems fated to be dumped by the women he loves. That these two lonely men should bond over their devotion to comatose loved ones is also fated A masterful film.",

            "content": "In Talk to Her Almodovar takes us with ballads and dance through a story where his leitmotif emerges once more. A situation that causes two consequences, from which the main characters can't escape, as one cannot exist without the other. Acknowledging one would require the same for the other; and even if one deserves such acknowledgement as eternal gratitude, the other can never be pardoned. Impunity in the end becomes the only possible path.\n\nBenigno commits a crime. His troubled mind, caused by 15 years of being his mother's caretaker, leads him to obsess about Alicia. By unfortunate chance she ends up in his hospital bed, under his constant nursing, surveillance and control. This fabricated relationship in his mind leads him to constantly caring for her, massaging her muscles, keeping her body fit. Ultimately he rapes her: the crime that can never be pardoned. At the moment of the birth of her child, she wakes up from her eternal coma: the consequence that deserves eternal gratitude. One act with two very opposite but coexisting consequences. And finally the impunity of Benigno, liberating himself from jail by committing suicide. In the end, was he ill-intentioned or, as his name hints, Benign?\n\nThe choice of the bullfighter profession for Lidia points out her strong character as a woman. On the inside nonetheless, we find another bullfighter, a sensible one, incapable of fighting even a small rat as well as the past romance that floods her lover's mind, and makes him cry with every memory. She falls in love with him, the bull she cannot fight.\n\nThe ballet represents the form of bodily expression which the comatose state contrasts.\n\nThe friendship between Benigno and Marco forms such tight bonds due to the loneliness both have, comprehension that only they could provide to each other.\n\nAs usual every detail is carefully picked by Almodovar. The subliminal color red, the camera close-up shots. Even for instance the play Benigno assists to, \"Amante menguante\", sort of \"diminishing lover\", which parallels with the diminishing lover Benigno becomes, craving to ultimately merge with Alicia and stay forever as a part of her.\n\nThe movie shows how even if we are masters at fighting, sometimes there are things we cannot fight. Even if we can control our bodies in total harmony, sometimes our bodies are beyond our control. Even the strongest fall. But most notably, some acts lead to dichotomy which has to be embraced with its two contrasting consequences effects, for a benevolent consequence cannot exist without a malevolent one.",

            "content": "This is the third film I've seen by Pedro Almodovar, and maybe the first to convince me that perhaps he really is a genius. This is one of those brilliant screenplays that comes along every once in a while that seems truly original and unique, while still telling a very moving and human story. This is one of the only foreign films to ever win the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, and it very well deserved it.\n\nThe film follows four characters: two women who both end up in comas, and the two men who attend to them. Alicia (Leonor Watling), a ballet dancer, has been in a coma for four years following a car accident. Benigno (Javier Camara), a gentle but awkward and odd male nurse, has been faithfully taking care of her for years. Lydia (Rosario Flores)is a bold bullfighter who is trampled by a bull and ends up in a coma; Marco (Dario Grandinetti) is her boyfriend who doesn't really know what to do now. As the two women lie comatose, the two men start a tentative sort of friendship.\n\nI don't want to spoil the story at all, but suffice it to say that it takes a number of surprising turns. It also deals with extremely difficult, complicated moral questions with an incredibly fine sense of nuance and balance. It would have been easy to totally have this movie go the wrong way, but Almodovar pulls it off and makes it look easy. There are a couple of fun flights of fancy here (including a fictitious silent film within the film), but for the most part the film feels very grounded and believable, even as shocking things happen. This is a movie I would recommend very highly to just about anyone.",

Working as a heartfelt character study and the unhinged visions of an offbeat artisan, this Almodovar joint packs the narrative zip of a soap opera and the emotional wallop of a Douglas Sirk melodrama. Here, Marco and Benigno share an odd friendship as they care for the respective women in their lives who are in deep comas; Lydia, Marco's unfaithful bullfighting lover, and Alicia, the hypnotically beautiful dancer who Benigno is assigned to care for as her nurse. The uncommonly brilliant dramatics are in place, but this also a Almodovar film, so naturally the film takes some less than sane tangents that only seem irrelevant when isolated such as the unforgettable image of a miniaturized man crawling into woman's lady parts. You read that correctly. Talk to Her bristles with innovation, ravishingly beautiful, dreamlike photography and a series of emotional gut punches that would floor Bruce Lee.",

These kind of moments range throughout but they don't take away from the films most powerful suit, the symbolism. There are many amazing moments, often Almodovar will artificially recreate the emotions of the two main characters (Marco & Benigno)  on the coma patients.  When Benigno speaks of Marco's crying during the first play he puts eye drops into his patient Alicia, creating artificial tears. This is done on another occasion during the silent film montage, which was a bizarre but great addition right before the climax. Once the tension is revealed the movie grows some deep but sick symbolism and themes. While the tension is not shocking since it was heavily preluded, the way Almodovar handles the situation is. The symbolism grows after this as you can literally see Benigno getting inside Marcos head when he first comes back to visit him. The necrophiliac premise is revolting, but the message Almodovar put across really got inside my head.\n\nNext up, Bad Education.",
