Directed by Roman Polanski, this is a tense and harrowing account of the atrocities suffered by the innocent Jewish people.  Tough watch at times but at the same time a must see.",

The movie is well directed and acted and it's a convincing period piece. There is a certain beauty to it especially by the end and the use of music throughout the movie are very well implemented. While this movie is very successful in accomplishing its goals, I must admit I found it a tad underwhelming at times too. This isn't necessarily the movies' fault as it's a very good depiction/dramatization of real events. I think the movie will be very effective if haven't seen similar stories but if you have, it's only the ending that truly makes The Pianist special.",

I suppose the piano playing, if only depicted on ocassion, presents the viewer with a clear sense of the beauty that still existed by those who were otherwise forced to be labelled as among the lowest class of people in German history at that time. There's undeniably a strong poignancy there. It conveys a depiction of disintegration, on a both personal and societal level.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments is depicted right at the start of the film, when said pianist (Wladyslaw Szpilman) is performing in I assume a recording studio and the impact of war based action is impossible to ignore.\n\nThis is a chilling/sobering watch. It highlights the hypocricy of the time its set and Adrien Brody gives a particularly powerful performance I'd say. A very thought provoking and sobering film, I'd recommend this.",

Roman Polansky creates such a personal tale by connecting us with Szpilman and by allowing us to see his highs and lows it creates an underdog story that everyone can root for, and it's helped even further through Adrien Brody's phenomenal performance. I'm glad that the topic isn't censored or watered down from the truth, as an authentic experience of the Jews treatment is necessary just to open your eyes to how bad the Holocaust was, and how cruel man can be towards each other. Whilst it's admittedly slow at times, the pacing matches the tempo of the story since hiding would be a tedious and boring activity, but it's able to always keep you engaged and alert with Red Herrings of danger and the fear of closing both eyes whilst sleeping. However, the first half is definitely the stronger part of the story, as most of the second half involved time leaps and the aforementioned naturally slow pacing. There's also a cyclical and ironic effect created through the film, as whilst the Jews are herded like Cattle and caged in Ghettos and Camps, by the end of the film the Russians enslave the Nazi's in PoW camps, and the whole full circle sense of Karma is really felt. The only thing honestly keeping me from despising the cruelness of humanity was the one outlier in the Nazi who helped keep Szpilman safe and fed, the one proof that even in the worst of times, there's always a shred of hope left.",

Showing all the bits and pieces of emotions that one can experience. He lived only one day at a time surviving by whatever means possible. The end was peculiar, as a German officer discovers him but asks him to play the piano.

The only background music were piano songs during the transition of scenes. No music at all when the horror was on the screen. \n\nBy not being shy from showing the violence, the movie emphasized the injustice and inhumanity that the Nazi brought to the Jewish people. However, even more surprising was that there were still some heart during this gruesome time. \n\nMy issue was that since this is a survival story, audiences didn't get to learn too much about the main character, other than the fact that he was a pianist.

The Pianist is as impactful and powerful as any film based on the subject matter.  Polanski's roaming camera serves as an objective eye, maneuvering through the ghetto capturing ruthless atrocity after ruthless atrocity.  Adrien Brody, in the role of Sziplman, is worthy of the accolades received for his performance.  Late in the film, he watches the Jewish uprising in silence from the safety of his hideout, his face emoting horror, regret, and shame.

I\u2019ve seen enough of the Holocaust. I know it was probably the ugliest and most horrendous moments in humanity\u2019s history. I know that Nazis did unspeakably awful things to Jews. I know that life for anyone Jewish was unbearable, for however long they could keep their lives. But over the years I\u2019ve seen so many films on the subject, my emotional reserves have been used up. I couldn\u2019t muster a tear for Wladyslaw Szpilman\u2019s struggle, and almost feel like I\u2019ve become desensitized to scenes of Jews being carted off to concentration camps or shot in the streets. My brain still sees the horror and hates that this was reality, but my heart has been drowned in similar shots in countless movies to the point where it can\u2019t continue to break every time I see it. In fact, I just watched a couple of similar films based on the true stories of Jews fleeing the Holocaust within the last month, so perhaps it was just bad timing. I think the other reason that The Pianist didn\u2019t connect with me as well as any number of similar stories is the passive role that Szpilman plays in his own story. In many ways he is merely an observer of what happens. His story is about fleeing, watching, and others helping him. Once his family is removed from the equation, we don\u2019t form much of a bond with anyone else we see suffering. I\u2019m not suggesting he did anything wrong, in fact his story is quite impressive. However, when I\u2019ve seen films about people inside the concentration camps, or forced to endure heinous acts of cruelty, it\u2019s hard to be as impacted by a guy who is hiding. I hope this doesn\u2019t make me sound too much like a monster, and I certainly didn\u2019t hate The Pianist. In fact, I was looking forward to hearing him play more, because the actual music was marvelous. It\u2019s impossible to be bored by a movie like this, because there\u2019s always some new horrible thing around the corner. I guess my standards for movies in this genre have just been raised too much, and it will take something truly original or outstanding to hit me with the power of Holocaust movies that came before.",

            "content": "A harrowing tale that takes place during The Holocaust.\n\nRoman Rolanski's historical drama epic The Pianist (2002) is a remarkably sympathetic story about one Polish pianist and composer named Wladyslaw Szpilman, who must survive The Holocaust and World War II as a Jewish man. The story is riveting and devastating with so much death and destruction like you cannot imagine. Polanski's direction is sobering with no glorification of violence in his action, but rather a somber depiction of mass death and unreal cruelty that Polish Jews faced at the hands of German Nazis. Polanski is a controversial figure and a repulsive man, but he is a stalwart director of gripping visual prowess and The Pianist is a definitive film within his illustrious cinematic career. The Pianist will make you feel traumatized at the sheer volume of the dead, hungry with pangs that you cannot sate, and sad for all the lost lives stolen by ruthless Germans.\n\nAdrien Brody is the reason to bear witness on The Pianist as he is a revelation of humanistic acting. His realism is so tragic and hard to watch. He brings a genuine likable personality alongside a deeply nuanced role as a man desperate to survive. His shaking gaunt body, limp walking gait, fluent linguistics, emotionally distraught eyes, and trembling voice all make him a riveting lead actor. Brody earnest his Oscar for Best Lead Actor several times over in The Pianist. He is simply a marvelous representation of how real a performance can come across. He finds a heart in the musical backdrop of The Pianist to keep him going and Brody is hypnotizing as he searches for food, often in vain, for any module of crumb to consume.\n\nThe score to The Pianist is breathtaking like the visuals of ruined cities and crumbled over corpses. You are mesmerized by masterful piano playing as the classical compositions gracefully cover all the bloodshed and agony throughout The Pianist. You are given a moment's reprieve from all the sorrow every time a song is played on piano during The Pianist.\n\nIn all, you should watch The Pianist because it is an important and shocking depiction of real life human atrocities carried out by cruel bloodthirsty Germans. Also Roman Polanski's direction is steadfast with a focus on the human moments of pain, disgust, hunger, confusion, fear, cruelty, compassion, empathy, and hope. The Pianist is so effectively moving and engrossing that Polanski makes a two and a half hour long film feel like only one. Adrien Brody's transformation into a Holocaust survivor alone is worth seeing as he keeps you on edge with every word.",

            "content": "Holocaust dramas are generally lauded and receive more Academy Award nominations than almost any other genre of film but few films received quite as much acclaim as this 2002 Roman Polanski hit. I was rather daunted by the film what with it's impressive reputation and long running time but it was a relatively easy watch compared to Son of Saul (2015) or The Search (1948). Obviously the fact that Roman Polanski directed the film attaches some controversy to it as it does seem unfair that somebody who committed horrible acts is able to direct such a large and acclaimed production. If you separate art from the artist you will be capable of appreciating this film and it's many wonderful components.\n\nSuccessful Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, Adrien Brody, witnesses growing anti-Semitism in Warsaw, Poland in 1939 as his family disagree over the approach they should take in facing this increasing threat. His celebrity keeps him safe as Jews are forced into ghettos and brutally punished for no reason. He is separated from his family when they are sent away to death camps while he is left behind in Warsaw, one of a few Jews who work as bricklayers. With his situation worsening he is forced into hiding and he relies on Dorota, Emilia Fox, a Polish woman he knew before conditions worsened to keep him safe in hiding. Through this all he retains his desire to play the piano and after the city becomes even more devastated and he hides in the wreckage of the ghetto he puts his talents to good use. After the Russians arrive to take back control of Poland he regains his freedom and is able to play the piano on the radio again.\n\nThe film is able to display the harrowing experience of being a Jew during this period through brief moments of senseless violence and sheer ruthlessness from Nazi oppressors who lose all humanity under a terrifying system. At several points we see large groups of random, innocent Jews executed for asking simple questions the Nazis or standing at the wrong point in a lineup. We are terrified by these scenes as we understand how wrong this situation is but we also see what luck Szpilman had in surviving and how the system destroyed the lives of the innocent. Viewing this tragedy through the eyes of a person who had no real political agenda and survived as a result of luck, and extraordinary resilience, not some grand scheme that made him better than the average person. The victims of the holocaust were regular, well meaning similar to civilians all around the world and making Szpilman an everyman figure of sorts leads us to identify with him more than we do with Sophie Zawistowski or Nelly Dreifuss.\n\nThere is power also in the impressive production values as the costumes, musical score and sheer scope of the film blow you away. Polanski is clearly a masterful director and he paces the film nicely as we get a sense of the escalating tensions occurring in Poland and the increasing desperation that Szpilman feels in addition to knowing how much time has passed. Anchoring the film is the soulful performance from Brody who earned an Academy Award for his efforts and considerable clout. Suffering and desperation are a common theme in award winning performances but Brody is equally convincing as the man willing to let intolerance from others slide in order to simply play his piano. The supporting cast put in fine performances with Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman being expectedly brilliant as his beaten down parents. Whether or not he is good man it cannot be denied that Polanski knows how to get the best out of everyone he works with, Pirates (1986) excepted.\n\nAlthough I have a lot of positive things to say about the film I would say it occasionally lacks in dramatic tension as long scenes of Brody starving and nobly suffering stretch on for far too long. These are minor complaints as the film as a whole is a satisfying and consistently interesting cinematic experience but sadly I struggle to call the film a masterpiece because for all it's weighty and important themes and technical brilliance it doesn't quite connect emotionally but it is still absolutely worth viewing.",

It's almost impossible and inhuman the way these Nazi's treated the Jewish people, almost as if they we're animals. That dancing scene was degrading.\n\nI love the way Polanski tackles this topic. It's almost like when you become used to the chaos like the dead body on the side of the pavement and everyone just kind of weaves around without thinking too much about the fact that it's a dead body since they're so used to it. He does an amazing job at painting it like a living nightmare. One in which everyone has learned to live in.\n\nAs brutal and bleak as this movie is, Polanski always finds ways to sneak in a laugh or two and I love it. His approach is pretty cynical to the whole thing. I mean being in a situation like that, what else can you feel? \n\nAmazing movie filled with emotion and depth. ",

He then struggles to survive in the final months of the war, with a little help. Quite harrowing and bleak at times, with not a heap of dialogue, but plenty of score and well filmed.

The movie is about a talented, Jewish pianist who uses all of his resources to escape from German soldiers during World War II. After splitting up from his family, he is left to fend for himself in a Warsaw ghetto, whilst fighting for food and cover. The acting from Adrien Brody was superb, especially when times were extremely hard for his character and the storyline was put together very well by Roman Polanski. I was a bit skeptical about the length of the film before watching it but it really didn't seem that long because of the detailed content and amazing cinematography. The ironic ending was shocking and surprising, which added to his amazing journey were he really hit rock bottom. I still find it hard to believe that it was a true story and it was one of those films were it takes some time to get out of that mode after watching it. Anyway, I'm not going to praise it anymore because I think you can tell that I really enjoyed it. Its hard to find a fault with the film so it has to get the thumbs up from me. Brilliant!\n\nRound-Up:\nI don't think that Adrien Brody, 42, has put in such a perfect performance since making this movie. I liked him in the Grand Budapest Hotel, Detachment, the Darjeeling Limited and Cadillac Records but his performance in this movie was excellent and he deserved the Oscar for a leading role. Personally, I like his acting style and he can comfortably switch genres with ease but the lack of good scripts are holding him back. He as proved that he can take on any challenge that is put in front of him but he hasn't hit the peak that he reached in 2002. Anyway, the movie was made by the acclaimed director, Roman Polanski, 82, who has been surrounded by controversy after being convicted of statutory rape on a 13 year old girl. Polanski then fled the USA to avoid prison so his movie making career was put on hold for some time. He's famous for making Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, Frantic, Bitter Moon, the Ninth Gate and Oliver Twist but his real comeback movie had to be this one. He also won a best director Oscar for this movie but he lost out to Chicago for the best picture. Polanski had his own personal experience with Nazis during World War II were he sadly lost his mother and was separated from his father for some time so this movie came from the bottom of his heart and you really can see it on screen.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nBudget: $35million\nWorldwide Gross: $120million\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are into their war/drama movies about a talented Jewish pianist who is on the run from German soldiers. 8/10",

            "content": "Divisive director Roman Polanski has had a polarizing career both behind camera and in a personnel sense yet whatever one may feel about the man or the filmmaker there is little doubt that his most effective and most profound movie is 2002's The Pianist. A true life war tale of incredible determination and bravery, Polanski's telling of accomplished Poland pianist and Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman ranks as one of cinemas greatest War set tales thanks to an incredibly realistic feel and a raft of award worthy acting turns.\n\nJustifiably winning Polanski a Best Director Oscar, The Pianist sees the veteran director at his highest creative peak, an artist moulding with his material perfectly to create a vividly alive look into the atrocities that faced Warsaw's Jewish community and all others of similar creeds during Hitler's reign of terror. Polanski's Warsaw is brimming with stark images, from bodies strewn in the streets of the Jewish \"ghettos\", snow covered buildings in the harsh reality of a European winter and the strange comforts of an upmarket caf\u00e9 as people go hungry outside, it's unquestionable that the setting of The Pianist is a character unto itself and part of the reason the movie works to the extent it does. It's interesting also to note how many a time Polanski films some of the movies most confronting scenes (wheelchair bound elders thrown from windows etc.) from a wide shot perspective, giving us the viewers a feeling of witnessing these events from far, powerless to stop what is happening yet not to the extent of being unaffected by it, much like our protagonist Wladyslaw Szpilman.\n\nIt would be remiss now with a decade hindsight of Adrien Brody to not remark on the power he displayed here as Szpilman. Brody inhabits Szpilman to an extent you quickly forget it is an actor you are watching, whether he is brave, scared or as time wears on dangerously gaunt, Brody delivers the Oscar winning turn that seemingly set him up for an illustrious career that so far has sadly failed to eventuate. It's impossible to say with full assurance that it's Brody's fault completely that he has failed to get close creatively to what he delivered here in Polanski's effort or if it is filmmakers that have failed him in their material. Whatever the case may be regarding Brody's disappointing post-Pianist career there is no taking away from his ageless performance here in an ensemble that all play their parts to perfection from Frank Finlay as Szpilman's aging father through to Thomas Kretschmann's small but pivotal role as German captain Wilm Hosenfeld.\n\nA heartening tale of survival, an indictment of the horrors of war and the evil within humanity, The Pianist is not always an easy watch but it's an important one. A truly stunning tale of the will to survive and a tension filled 2 and a half hours thanks to Polanski's no fuss professional turn behind camera, this is true life based storytelling at its finest and a worthy film to sit alongside other revered War based film classics.\n\n5 bits of caramel out of 5 \n\nFor more movie reviews and opinions check out - \n\nwww.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",

I'm not saying that folks should stop making movies about it, but it feels like every approach to the topic has already been done.  Polanski seems to have found a new approach, or at least I would say that his film doesn't feel like other Holocaust films to me.  \"The Pianist\" has a detached, fatalistic dread about it.  It depicts life collapsing in such a terrible way that nothing good can come of it.  Wladyslaw Szpilman survives, but not because he was especially resourceful or smart.  He's helped, but not dramatically and not by people who are saints compared to other people (in fact, some are decidedly not).  Szpilman survives because the universe lines up correctly for him, but it doesn't feel like a triumph since everyone close to him wasn't so lucky.  I think this is the best film Polanski has made since the 1970s.",

Many have rejoiced Roman Polanski's The Pianist as a World War 2 masterpiece exploring one man's resilience and determination to survive, which are common but effective themes to explore but Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood couldn't bring anything unique or with intense emotional impact to an already exhaustive concept.\n\nThe film spends the bulk of its first and second act, following Wladyslaw Szpilman and the significant aspect of his life that he has lost. I felt that Harwood and Polanski could have added a couple of scenes that would show the personal impact of his losses. It was clear within the first 20 minutes of the film that he is deeply attached to his art and family; shouldn't the film instead explore this if Polanski aims to create a personal and intimate experience? Also, I felt the film did not explore or emphasise enough, the protagonist's need to adapt to this sudden change of lifestyle; very few scenes show the natural fear and anxiety that one would feel when placed in a similar situation. That being said, I was not at all bored watching this aspect of the film, as there were some moments where drama was exquisitely crafted, without reaching extreme levels of sentimentality. The film's strongest area resides on its final act, where we actually get to see some growth from the character and shows the audience that this man is determined to survive and can somehow do so without relying too much on others. The film also shows a subtle and effective relationship between our protagonist and a German soldier; I will not give away the fruits of these moments as seeing them displayed a side of the film and Polanski, that I never knew had the potential to achieve. The final act also finally emphasises the impact that his passion for playing the piano or composing music has had on him since the war; I only wish that the film touched on it much earlier, instead of saturating it during the final moments of the film.\n\nIn all of his films, Polanski has given his films a subtle but distinctive visual or technical style to further spotlight the themes that are being explored or achieve an atmosphere that would either reflect intrinsic shadings of his characters, Rosemary's Baby, or simply to create effective tension, Frantic, or beauty, Tess. The Pianist sadly felt visually flat, lacking emphasis in its cinematography. The film is certainly ambitious in its production design, displaying the catastrophic destruction of Warsaw and the aching disintegration of its social structure; but the lack of artistic expression in its photography prevented the film from seeming visually perfect.\n\nThe performances in this film were, however, consistently strong with Adrien Brody playing this character, not revealing too much of his role's internal qualities through forced emotions or dialogue, instead relying it under the masterful hand of Roman Polanski. The director knew exactly what he wanted from Brody and he successfully was able to bring it out of him, which is something that Brody has not been able to do with other directors.\n\nThe Pianist does not possess the same emotional and humanitarian substance of Schindler's List or the social, cultural and physical destruction or disintegration of Children of Men; but it does provide enough to sit through with its ideas of survival, loss, and resiliency, and of course, Adrien Brody's performance.",

            "content": "Directed by Roman Polanski and written by Ronald Harwood (Australia (2008) and Quartet (2012)), this is a true story based on the autobiography written in 1946 by W?adys?aw Szpilman. It was also a very personal film for Polanski, as he'd grown up in the horrors of the Krak\u00f3w Ghetto during the war, and he could identify with Szpilman's plight. It's a harrowing film, but it's a powerful and shocking tale of survival. In September 1939, Polish-Jewish pianist W?adys?aw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) and his family including his father (Frank Finlay) and mother (Maureen Lipman) are caught up in the Nazi invasion of Poland and they're soon forced to move out of their expensive apartment and move to a designated Ghetto in Warsaw. They struggle to survive, but W?adys?aw makes a living as a pianist making what money he can. However in August 1942, when his family are rounded up and sent to an extermination camp, W?adys?aw escapes and tries to survive in the almost deserted ghetto with what friends he has left, and he faces a tough struggle for survival in Warsaw. It is a powerful and upsetting film, but it is a film about an unbreakable spirit, and someone who refused to do what the Nazi's said, Brody is magnificent as Szpilman, and he rightfully picked up an Oscar for his performance, plus Polanski and Harwood picked up Oscars for bringing this story to the screen.",

A hell of a lot that all seemingly ties together the threads of the plot and seamlessly weaves them together to string the film. Seemingly. \n\nWe get it, it's a movie about a holocaust survivor. That's what the movie basically is, but it unintentionally drives you into confusion over what the movie's trying to tell you. What about the hero of the hour, the one and only Wladyslaw Szpilzamanazamowam? We all understand that what he sees around him is one of the darkest times in human history, but, it just... happens. Things happen and he's suddenly in the middle of it, and somehow he gets through it. This is a true story and all, but it feels like an over-dramatization. I was more interested in the side characters than the blank-as-a-brick se\u00c3\u00b1or Szpilthabills. We get it. He wants to get out. The movie doesn't really show him using some smart tactics or intelligence to escape. It makes you feel like any one of these prisoners could have escaped. He just escapes by getting his oblivious ass caught in another mess and seemingly gets out alive and becomes another step closer to freedom. Rinse and repeat. Cut. Print. Roll in the awards because \"muh tru story\"\n\nI wouldn't regard this as a masterpiece, but it entertains. And it does a damn good job. It makes you sympathize with everyone Mr. Szpzpzpzpzzpzpz interacts with. You feel what they're going through. You feel their fear. Amidst the feelings, all I ended up \"feeling\" by the time it was over was that it felt incomplete. \n\nMy recommendation is to watch it once and find out for yourself what you think about this movie.",

Adrien Brody deserves applause for his role as Szpilman and for me it is his best ever acting performance.

Among the non-documentary features made about the Holocaust, this is the most emotionally restrained and morally complex examination of the day-to-day struggle for survival. We see the consequences of how war causes individuals to become collaborators, profiteers, or members of the resistance.  Director Roman Polanski's movies are notorious for depicting a pessimistic worldview but this is his most personal and hopeful movie to date. (Polanski survived the Krakow ghetto while his mother perished in a concentration camp.) Szpilman is a passive hero but this is not a passive movie. Storytelling momentum fades near the end but it remains captivating. Ronald Harwood adapted the memoir. Cinematography is by Pawl Edelman; Music is by Wojciech Kilar. The picture took the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and won Oscars for Best Actor (Adrien Brody), Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. With Thomas Kretschmann, Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emilia Fox, Michal Zebrowski.",
