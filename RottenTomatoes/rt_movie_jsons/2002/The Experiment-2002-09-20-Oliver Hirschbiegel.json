    "summary": "As part of a psychological research project, twenty recruits will be divided up into prisoners and guards. In a controlled penitentiary-like environment, \"prisoners\" are incarcerated and ordered to obey the rules, \"guards\" are instructed to keep order. They will be thrown head-first into a two-week long examination of the effects of assigned roles, power and control, and won't be the same when it's over. But it's just a simulation. Or is it?",

            "content": "In fact, I expected a little more from this film.  A film in the bowels of a research laboratory made according to a real event, where the whole experiment gets out of control, is certainly a tempting topic. Unfortunately, the content of the film is no longer like that.  The whole film came to me a bit sloppy, but it certainly didn't bore me.  I like movies from the prison environment, but probably because it was de facto just a game, as some actors in the film said, it didn't bother me that much, but I still think that you will find this film for your fans.  I definitely rate this film positively, even though I expected more from it",

I know it's an experiment gone wrong, but the scenes are still surprising. You can never really understand the psyche of the human mind, especially filled with anger and desperation. Anything can happen! And it was crazy!",

            "content": "\"Das Experiment\" is a movie based on the Stanford prison experiment back in the 70's, while it's obviously made more extreme for the sake of entertainment, it still succeeds at creating a claustrophobic, tense experience.  Mortiz Bleibtreu from Run Lola Run is the main character and is pretty great, while the rest of the cast is equally good, playing interesting roles on both the prisoner and guard sides.\n\nWhile you can guess the outcome from a mile away, it's still intriguing throughout and the 2 hour duration damn near flies by, especially when all hell breaks loose.  This movie is also a prime example of early 2000's German cinematography.  It's fast paced, surreal, and visceral like a MTV music video, when MTV was still good.  It feels great and fits the mood perfectly.\n\nThough overall, this movie is worth your time, there are some problems.  As I said, the movie is predictable near the end and there's an \"everything that could go wrong, will go wrong\" feel to the whole thing, that rides throughout.  It's not a deal breaker, but it gets annoying.  Also the final frames leave much to be desired, since it goes for the art house route instead of showing more of the aftermath.  \n\nDas Experiment, it's fun, disturbed, and visceral.  A great time with friends or by yourself.  Definitely recommended.\n\nPROS:  Tense, well acted, nails the late 90's vibe well, music video-esque at times\nCONS:  Weak ending, predictable",
