    "summary": "Based on the classic science fiction novel by Stanislaw Lem, \"Solaris\" centers on a psychologist (George Clooney) sent to investigate unexplained behavior of key scientists on a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. Once aboard he, too, falls victim to this unique world's mysteries -- as well as to an erotic obsession with someone he thought he had left behind.",

            "content": "Steven Soderbergh's Solaris, a remake of Andrei Tarkovsky's science fiction classic from 1972, compares fairly well with the original film.  Soderbergh wisely scales back on many of the more cerebral elements of the original and doesn't pay as much attention to the artistic stylings that can be found in Tarkovsky's version, making it a more audience friendly film.  When psychologist Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is asked to visit a space station orbiting Solaris to investigate vague reports of mysterious incidents, he discovers a nightmarish scenario that could threaten the existence of humanity.  It's a movie filled with fascinating scenarios and themes, a great performance from Jeremy Davies as one of the afflicted inhabitants of the space station, some solid special effects, and effective cinematography.  Clearly, while some of the themes may not be of interest to its audience, others will find it a thought-provoking challenge.",

I say that as it has a definite mysterious feel to it from the outset, with the viewer not getting much in the way of insight into whats going on but the more we see, the more intriguing and complicated things may appear. George Clooney does well in his role as a psychologist and I thought it was quite atmospheric, with a real looming sense/feel to it and believable people acting erratically while on board the isolated research station in space. Its a bit of a slow burner of a film but its certainly not a bad one. I liked that the background music/sound effects weren't too loud and 'in your face' and I thought the dialogue was quite good at times, although it can't be said that there's constant dialogue as some times scenes pass without long and convoluted discussions. One thing I found a little frustrating was that in some scenes, the dialogue was quite quiet, with characters talking in hushed tones - this may be an issue for people who are hard of hearing. This film has a somewhat philosophical side to it, which I quite liked. The focus on a lack of memory intrigued me. Also, some scenes feature relatively shaky/jerky camerawork, which might frustrate some viewers.\n\nThis is definitely more of an arty/'deep' philosophical film than anything else and so it may seem a bit pretentious to some but in any case, overall; yes, I would recommend this film as I personally found myself pretty engrossed in it.",

While Tarkovsky's version moves along with the slow but assured pace of a cinematic juggernaut steadily fomenting a mood of solemn reflection along the way, Soderberg goes right to the heart of the matter, immediately teasing out the mind-bending implications of the story's search for human identity. While I can't say that I enjoyed Soderberg's version more than Tarkovsky's, I must confess that I liked it at least as much, appreciating the uniquely stylized and ultimately more disciplined take on the material. Be forewarned: enter only if you are prepared for a sedately paced immersion into a maze of existential inquiry which prioritizes unadorned contemplation of human relationships and emotions over the rollercoaster experience which so typifies the sci-fi status quo.",

There are no traditional antagonists in this film; Chris' greatest enemy is a burden of conscience that he carries with him, the presence of which weighs down his soul and clouds his judgment. Initially, he doesn't believe his visitor is Rhea. Later, he no longer cares. The presence of someone who looks, feels, and sounds identical to his dead wife gives him an opportunity to assuage the pain of misplaced responsibility. The number of \"thinking\" science fiction films is small, and most are produced on small budgets for start-up directors. The first-rate production values and A-list star make Solaris an exception - and a rewarding one, at that.",

My sole experience with Solaris is the divisive 2002 version by Steven Soderbergh. That being said, what I found with the 2002 version is a beautiful, cerebral, emotionally-engaging, and melancholic exploration into loneliness, guilt, existentialism, the metaphysical, and so much more. When a space station goes silent near the planet, Solaris, therapist, Dr. Chris Kelvin is sent to investigate what happened based on a video recording sent by one of the crew members, asking him by name to come. Even a security team sent in before him never returned, so the trip is already looking uneasy. Upon arriving, he sees blood trails and very few signs of life. He finds two crew members - Snow, a strange and neurotic crew member, and Gordon, who is filled with paranoia and doesn't even want to come out of her room at first. The other crew members are dead, due to the unexplained phenomena that the crew are experiencing (Though, Dr. Kelvin does see a child, but is unable to catch him and talk to him). During his stay, Dr. Kelvin is awakened by his wife, Rheya, who thinks they are at home together. Dr. Kelvin is understandably taken aback by this...because she's dead. Dr. Kelvin's time on the ship becomes a time of emotional torment as old memories are awakened and as he and the surviving crew members try to figure out what exactly is going on around them...all while being trapped in the terrifying isolation of space. Solaris is a gripping, slow-building drama that really strikes a chord as Dr. Kelvin relives memories of his marriage to Rheya - the good times, the bad times, and the ugliest of times that resulted in tragedy. It becomes incredibly heartbreaking at times, but never in an overwrought way. Rather, the way it unfolds is shown to us in a more believable manner, making such scenes all the more crushing. What makes it worse is that whatever force that has taken the form of Rheya states that she only exists through his memories and how he remembers her, causing her torment as she experiences these things, trapping her in a never-ending existential nightmare. It's a film that ponders life with all of its ups and downs, as well as exploring the possibility of a higher power and forces beyond our control. I found it to be a superb film that had made me engaged from beginning to end. I wanted to know what was happening, I wanted to dissect the myriad themes, and I was also engaged emotionally, becoming invested in the turmoil of Dr. Kelvin's life. I think Solaris is one of the most underrated and best films of the 2000's. We need more sci-fi films like this.",

So far so Event Horizon, albeit sans gore, more a journey into the inner workings of the mind, love, perception of what is real, and what it means to be human.

            "content": "Short Review:\n\nA near perfect blend of visual storytelling, atmosphere, performance and dialogue. Slow but sometimes unengaging, Solaris is a film which garners the attention of the viewer for much of its running time, and refuses to throw itself to genericisms. A wild, heartfelt and beautiful ride that slightly stumbles in terms of its sometimes choppy editing (I don't give a shit if it was intentional; the editing took me out of the immersion a few times throughout) and dull final act, which only picks itself up with ten minutes to go.\n\nElongated Review:\n\nMusic to set the tone\n\nThe azure brilliance glows glorious; it is blatantly made out to be otherworldly. It holds no life, nor anything that could sustain such. Instead, it cultivates, manipulates and destroys the lives of others that come to rest at the shores of its influence. It is an alien planet that truly possesses a form of higher intelligence; perhaps not the type that we as humans for thousands of years have estimated ethereal beings would be capable of, but a quantity of perception and intellect all the same. It is both mesmerising, seductive, but utterly dangerous. It has the ability to exploit our own emotions and use them against us for its own benefit. And whilst that benefit is unbeknownst to us, its effects are still very much noticeable and potent.\n\nWelcome to Solaris.\n\nSteven Soderbergh's sci-fi picture about the human condition in terms of its emotional boundaries, as well as otherworldly creatures and planets, our hypothesis', our desires, is a masterclass of ambiguity, patience and dedication. Solaris centres around a psychologist named Kris Kelvin, played by George Clooney, who is sent to a space station orbiting the enigmatic and peculiar planet Solaris, after a distress message is sent out from one of the passengers, a passenger who happens to be an associate and friend of Kelvin's. After he is sent up to the space station, he discovers strange doings performed by the inhabitants; they exhibit unexplained behavior that Kelvin himself can not fully decipher. It is not until he is subjected to the strange powers of Solaris himself that Kelvin becomes prey to the same condition. As his ability to be able to discern what is and isn't real deserts him, he becomes subject to erotic fantasies and dreams about his late wife, Rheya. Soon enough though, such fantasies escalate, and Kelvin's imagination may prove more realistic than it seems.\n\nSolaris starts on Earth, with cold and distant lighting beckoning us forth into this story of peril and personal destruction. Soderbergh explains little to us within the initial scenes, primarily utilizing visual cues to describe certain ideas about our protagonist, the world he calls home and Solaris. These initial scenes are cold and lifeless on purpose, any ounce of heart or warmth long departed. There is a texture to Earth, thanks to the rain displayed (one of the opening shots is somewhat reminiscent to my favourite take from Seven, which features a mood-setting and dark heavy rainfall), but that does not necessarily evoke any sense of life. The extras are nearly all faceless and distant from the central character; even when Kelvin interacts with them and the minor characters, we don't see their faces. We hear their voices, see their bodies and watch their movements, but we never properly see their faces. We are alone with our detached psychologist, detached for reasons unknown at this point in time, and Soderbergh evokes this as much as he possibly can. It's gripping work, and immediately sets the tone for the rest of the picture.\n\nKelvin receives a message from his scientist colleague and friend Dr. Gibarian. Gibarian implores Kelvin to come to Solaris to witness the manifestation of a strange power; one that is weakening the mental endurance of all those on the space station orbiting the planet. As a psychologist, Kelvin is qualified for the situation at hand, and is requested by envoys of the corporation who own the space station to trek out and convince the crew members to abandon the mission and return to Earth; all members of the mission had been reluctant to leave prior to this point. This entire scene that features Kelvin receiving the distress message contains a slow and begrudging atmosphere, the message from Gibarian long and drawn out with few cuts throughout. There is no score over the top, nor is there any overtly dramatic lighting cues. Gaffer James Plannette delivers a cold orange colour for the set, and it feels hostile and unwelcome. All throughout the scene, the camera lingers on Kelvin, his every movement and emotion accented with the long takes utilized. Soderbergh undertook both the editing and cinematography roles, and his work here is exceptional. He doesn't cut away, nor does he seek to add flair to the visuals. There is a keen simplicity to the scene that articulates Clooney's performance; a performance which understates the residual and underlying emotional complications that exist within his being. At this point in time, we do not know why he is the way he is. Only time shall tell.\n\nWith Cliff Martinez's surprisingly versatile score blaring over the top, thematic inclusions abound, the film instigates the central plot, Kelvin heading off to Solaris. The film doesn't waste much time with unnecessary reflections, but instead simply cuts to Kelvin's ship approaching the space station that orbits the clear and bewildering planet below. It is a beautiful sight, and whilst rendered not as realistically as other planets depicted in films in the past, takes on a more transcendental quality. It feels spiritual and wholly otherworldly. As Kelvin draws closer to his target, the slow tone and visual splendour evoke comparisons to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. As of so far, Solaris is entirely enthralling. Kelvin enters the space station shortly after, and finds himself alone amongst the sterile and antagonistic corridors of his directive. Within these scenes, Soderbergh and Martinez resist the urge to build anticipation with a predictable score that ostinatos and performs volume fluctuations for cheap gasps. The director wishes to capture a vibe and mood as Kelvin takes his first steps around the new location, and he achieves as such. It is both gripping and engrossing watching our protagonist traverse the unknown predicament, his lack of knowledge about the situation echoing our own.\n\nThe sound design is hollow and lacking personality. Everything sounds metallic and lacks human quality. The framing becomes wider and even yet more distant. As Kelvin explores, he comes across a child walking around the space station. He attempts to capture the youngling, but to no avail. Questions arise in our head, but the film refuses to acknowledge them. It will get to them in due time. Instead, we are met with our first major supporting character; a crew member named Snow, played by Jeremy Davies. There is something promptly strange about Snow. Davies fidgets with his surroundings and moves his body in strange and inhuman ways, and it is immediately off-putting. The screenplay echoes the sentiment that his body gives us; that this character is not to be trusted, Snow's dialogue jumping around in an indecipherable form that leads to more questions than answers. Kelvin's lack of emotion is still evidently unpleasant, but his distance feels more at home here more than ever. Alongside Snow, they make a strong team, their minimal individual personalities and uninviting dialogue blending together to form a very strange but reassuring chemistry.\n\nSnow points Kelvin towards an emotionally distraught female crew member named Dr. Gordon, played by Viola Davis. She is more spiteful to both the situation and Kelvin, and provides him few answers as to why the rest of the crew part Snow and herself, including Dr. Gibarian, are either dead or unaccounted for. Soderbergh paints Gordon in a light that makes her seem more fragile and malevolent than Snow, despite the fact that she is revealed later on to be of a more stable, intelligent mind (supposedly) than him, and containing of more logical thoughts and answers than anyone else on board. It's this effect instigated by the powers of Solaris; the ability to provoke an emotional dissonance between individuals, and even themselves, that unsettles and disfigures our ability to quantify and calculate the underemphasized competence of the antagonistic planet.\n\nDespite all the strange and inconclusive answers provided by the two remaining crew members as to what occurred to their fellow men and women, as well as themselves, there is never a building force that allows us to anticipate any conflicts or issues. The first concern that arises, part the fact that the two crew members sound and act half-mad, is evoked after Kelvin goes to bed. He dreams about a beautiful, stunning lady. She is staring at him, and he is staring back. The size and distance of the frame that accompanies the scenes that are shot within the space station is replaced with a frame that features lesser aperture. The focal length is increased, and we are gifted with a far more intimate palette of visuals, something that proves more aesthetically pleasing on a fundamental level. We witness Kelvin smiling; a first in the film. The subsequent scene reveals to us the identity of the woman, thanks to the aforementioned Gibarian; Rheya. She brings out a warmth in Kelvin that is most appreciated, and their following love scenes show a tenderness in the protagonist that has been unprovoked prior.\n\nAll seems well and good, until Rheya appears in the space station. Flashing in and out of the supposed dream-sequences, we witness two intertwining sex scenes; one occurring inside Kelvin's mind, and the other happening above Solaris, in modern times. Perhaps these are intertwining dream sequences, one is prone to questioning. Such an argument is proven meaningless when Kelvin awakes to find Rhaeya beside him. His confusion is obvious, and we finally get a proper answer to a question that we have possessed the entire time whilst on the space station; what truly are the effects of Solaris? Through subsequent scenes, we come to understand that Rheya is dead, and the cause of the perpetual depression that Kelvin resides within. He is emotionally distraught due to her harrowing suicide, caused after she terminated a pregnancy and was pushed away briefly by Kelvin. Soderbergh again allows his visuals to expand upon the relationship, their closeness and understanding of each other elaborated upon with scenes of love, heart and passion that contain few words.\n\nAt first, Kelvin knows his duty. He sends this fake Rheya off in an escape capsule, sending her out into the abyss of space to die. At this point, he can decipher between what's real and what isn't, and the audience is reassured by this. Soderbergh begins to explain himself, that this sudden and strange conflict is due to the powers of Solaris. He does such with visuals and dialogue between namely Snow and Kelvin. He uncovers the fact that Rheya will not stay dead, as she is a figment of his memories and personality that Solaris is evoking as a physical being. To what end does Solaris seek with this strategy, we are led to ask. The answer is not clear at any point throughout the film, and frustrates not only ourselves but our protagonists. They, along with us, desire meaning behind such an event, as otherwise they are unable to combat the threat. But little do they, or more so Kelvin, know that the planet looming beneath them can not be fought or contained; its powers are too great for one to even consider taming them. So Gordon establishes a plan to rid themselves of Rheya and the other beings created from memories (the other crew members have endured the same as our protagonist), and to flee to Earth. But Kelvin is suddenly hesitant to do so. Kelvin now has an opportunity to correct what he believes were misdeeds in his past, and so he is unwilling to leave his dead wife to the past.\n\nSoderbergh's cinematography continues to grow in size and distance, leaving us to feel as if the protagonists are being watched by something. Mayhaps it is the child that Kelvin attempted to capture as he arrived on the space station; the answer I'd prefer to side with would be that it is Solaris itself watching. This adds a whole new dimension to the drama, that leaves the titular planet feeling less like an antagonist, and more so reminiscent of a curious being that wishes to study the emotional ramifications that presenting a physical memory to a human would bring about. Suddenly, Solaris has personality. Meanwhile, the space station drifts closer to the planet, the gravitational field increasing supposedly as a response to the actions of the humans. A newly formed Rheya comes to understand the artificial nature of her existence, and wishes to be destroyed by a machine that Dr. Gordon has constructed. Kelvin, who wants to relive his better days and wishes to stay stuck in the past, does not desire Rheya to leave him to his own devices again, especially after the perilous and never-ending despondency he had to endure after her initial passing. But this artificial version of the real Rheya can not construct her own memories (for some reason, I find this comparable to the short-term memory loss suffered by Leonard in Christopher Nolan's Memento), and does not desire the opportunity to live. So Gordon destroys her whilst Kelvin sleeps, and gifts our protagonist the opportunity to leave the dreaded orbit. They discover that \"Snow\" is in fact the brother of the real Snow, and he himself is one of the constructs of Solaris' powers. This reveal leaves the two surviving, human astronauts no resolution but to leave immediately.\n\nAnd this is where the film stumbles for a portion. The film's climax was never intended to come as a rush, and whilst that is understandable, the fact that the film never feels like it's stepping up in stakes proves troublesome. The slow pace as the film hurtles towards the ending contradicts itself, and the audience member is lost for an extended period. Kelvin abandons the escape pod and Gordon, leaving himself to die as the space station sinks closer and closer to he dreaded surface of Solaris, the waves of pink grandeur consuming the ship. Gordon drifts outside the gravitational field, whilst Kelvin submits to his inevitable doom. The lure of Solaris has finally become too much for him, and he decides to stay. The addiction becomes too much of a burden though, as shortly after Gordon leaves, he loses his ability to stand, his weakness obvious.\n\nThe child from before appears, offering a hand to Kelvin. We cut suddenly to Earth. It appears as if our protagonist has miraculously made it back to home, but is struggling to return to normal functioning after the strange occurrences abroad. But this is not real, we soon understand; whereas in the beginning of the film we see Kelvin cut himself and deal with the injury over time, he cuts himself during this period but the injury instantaneously heals itself. So what has happened, we are led to ask. Is this Kelvin now a replica of the original Kelvin, living in a constructed, fanciful version of the real Kelvin's life, assembled by Solaris? Is this the real Kelvin, still alive thanks to the curiosity and power of the ethereal being he fell into?\n\nAll we know for sure is that Kelvin meets his wife, and Rheya exclaims that they can finally be together now, free of the past. They are now transcendent of the general definitions of life and death, and their future can be spent together infinitely, thanks to the power of Solaris. No longer do the two have to live according to the memories Kelvin had constructed with him and Rheya; he can finally make new ones, and bring about a whole new life for them. But what is the value of that relationship continuing in such a context as this? Is this relationship actually occurring in reality, or is Solaris so curious about the human condition and our emotional attachments that it may even be recreating the relationship, to study and observe it?\n\nAll acceptable questions; some more so than others. What I can say for sure that is definite, is that Solaris is an exceptional picture. It reflects on the power of memories, our individual relationships, and the detriment that living in the past can cause. Soderbergh is unafraid to prod at emotional and moral conflicts, and what results is a film that is utterly sensational in its dedication to tone, themes and message. It's not perfect; the final act, as I mentioned, features numerous periods of stale film that doesn't really click perfectly. It finds its footing again in the final ten minutes, but for a good period, there is little to fully grip the audience member. That, and there are a number of disjointed pieces of editing, perhaps caused by the fact that Soderbergh himself took on such a role. Whether these were intentional or not, I do not care; they broke immersion, and proved irritating. That said, Solaris still contains enough technical wizardry and passion to be considered an absolutely commendable piece of entertainment. It even features an actually impressive score from Cliff Martinez; a man whose recent work could be considered less than acceptable. His humming and droning is sacrificed for a more melodic approach that achieves better, ethereal, stunning results. The same can be said for the majority of this film. This is a transcendent experience that has to be seen to be believed. It is lavish, beautiful, gripping for much of its duration, and contains strong performances and tight cinematography all throughout. Soderbergh's meticulous vision and auteur style dictates that Solaris is undeniably a triumph throughout thick and thin.",

I thought it was a good take on the classic film, but it doesn't have the epic visuals and terrific, yet simple story that the original possessed. Of course, this film echoes what the 1976 film had, but it never goes in depth with its subject, and it doesn't do anything new or refreshing. With that being said, Watch the original film instead, it's far superior and it's a classic of the genre. This remake is good, but it never comes close to the original. The acting in this remake is very good, and I thought that overall it was a solid film, but it also rushed through the story a bit. With the original, it took its time to let the story unfold and it worked brilliantly and that's one of the main reasons that Tarkovsky's Sci Fi classic is so unique and ultimately memorable. With this remake, you get a far shorter film, one that doesn't reach its potential and in turn lacks the development that made the original so good. Nonetheless, this remake is good, but it could have been better as well. Luckily the cast are great, and it's the film's strongest asset. However, I would recommend the 1976 film instead of this one, but if you want a more stripped down version, with less ambitious ideas, then this remake is for you.  In terms of revamping a classic film, Solaris like every other remake before or after it has left a bit to be desired, and makes you want to watch the original film. The ideas expressed on-screen, are things we've seen before, and there never is new blood injected into the story. For a remake however, it's quite good, but it's nothing compared to the film that came before it.",

Dr. Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is a haunted man, mourning the loss of his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). He accepts a mission by his friend Dr. Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur) to the space station Solaris, which is orbiting the distant planet of the same name. When Kelvin arrives, he finds most of the crew are dead or have vanished under mysterious circumstances, and Gibarian has died, and the two surviving crew members Dr. Gordon (Viola Davis) and Snow (Jeremy Davies) don't want to say what happened.

After recently watching the fantastic Gravity in all it's 3D IMAX glory, I think it's time to revisit Clooney in space one more time. Soderbergh's success has always been with people, people and their relationships. They are always very real and this has always been what drives my appreciation of his films. Solaris does just that and does it extremely well. With a stellar score, a memorable performance from Clooney and a haunting storyline, this is an intelligent and visually impressive addition to Soderbergh's filmography.",

Soderbergh occupies most of the primary creative slots: director, screenwriter, cinematographer and editor. He is supported by great acting, set design and film score.\n\nViola Davis' character is too freaked out for her own good. While the other characters are contemplative about their situation, she's yelling. I found that very distracting, but Soderbergh must have been okay with it, since he wrote it that way, and he was fine with her acting that way.\n\nThis movie isn't pretentious or difficult to understand. It is true science fiction that does demand attention and thought. That is very rare in commercial filmmaking. Adventurous movie fans should give this a try!",

Not a remake of the Tarkovsky classic, but another interpretation of the book; Soderbergh does a fantastic job of building atmosphere slowly, but not too slow as to lose the viewer. We can figure out what is going on before we're told, but that doesn't take away from what's happening on screen at all. In fact, it then raises all the philosophical and metaphysical, moral questions one must ask. When a movie makes you think this much about ideas, I always find that to be a great sign.  I definitely want to see the original now, but I think this stands as a very interesting piece on it's own merits. Well worth a watch if you like topics like life/death/afterlife, love, what you would do for one more chance, non-human intelligence, and so forth. I think the focus on Chris (Clooney) and his love for his wife (McElhone) is a great addition to the plot and really acts as a cornerstone, along with Solaris (the planet) through which to examine the deep philosophical ideas. Worth watching for sure.",

            "content": "Though I never had the slightest belief that a second cinematic adaptation of Solaris could transcend the success of Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 adaptation, with Steven Soderbergh as director and George Clooney as the star I figured it couldn't be too bad.\n\nAlthough Solaris will undoubtedly draw comparisons to Andrei Tarkovsky's unbeatable adaptation of the text, Steven Soderbergh respectively makes the decision to focus his efforts on creating his own adaptation of the text rather than a remake. His adaptation is his own work and does not try to be anything else. \nSteven Soderbergh's adaptation of Solaris puts the focus on the relationship between the two main characters as it is essentially the heart of the tale. Unfortunately, it gets so caught up in doing so that it ends up ignoring a lot of the more complicated science fiction and psychological plot points that Andrei Tarkovsky's version touched upon. The visual effects and production design of the film do an impressive job of conveying the nature of the setting, but the central point of Solaris is that it is a science fiction concept for the mind and not for the eyes. Andrei Tarkovsky's adaptation only touched upon the concepts of the titular planet lightly to the disappointment to the author of the original text Stanislaw Lem, but Steven Soderbergh's does it even less. There is no sight of the supposed ocean that is the planet, and so the film really neglects its potential to expand upon what the author would have wanted, and it lacks enough psychological elements to stand up too high. Instead of focusing on the melancholic emptiness of being in space, Solaris constantly reminds viewers that the protagonist has constant human contact with the other character Doctor Gordon. Since the film has less running time than the original and limits its material to a mere 99 minutes of cinema, the movement of everything is a lot quicker and so the sense of emptiness is not felt, except for in the limited exploration of the material that Steven Soderbergh puts into the film. While Solaris has been criticized for its slow pace, it moves along at a quicker rate than Andrei Tarkovsky's adaptation, largely because among other things it only runs for around half the running time. I hardly felt that the pace of Solaris was anything but necessary because it once again worked to capture the intricate and humane nature of the premise. Unfortunately, there is just not enough of it. Frankly, Solaris is a stylish adaptation of its text, and I may not be the perfect person to critique it as I have never read the novel itself but I was very fond of the complex psychology presented in the 1972 adaptation which was not found in this version. Perhaps the adaptation feels a bit too contemporary and perhaps it is an unnecessary film as the ideologies and themes in the film were already proposed 30 years prior by Andrei Tarkovsky in a superior manner and by this point it just doesn't feel as intelligent. The screenplay itself maintains strong dialogue and there are some smart aspects to it, but it just feels all done before.\nBut even though there is not too much new to learn from Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of the classic text, he still handles the film gently. As well as ensuring that the language in the film is intelligent and the atmosphere of the film is emotionally atmospheric in a gentle fashion, Steven Soderbergh really has Solaris looking and sounding good. With the use of the aforementioned production design and visual effects as well as strong cinematography techniques, Solaris is a very good looking and detailed film which is thoroughly convincing which is illuminated further by the use of colourful lighting. The simple yet effective production design of Solaris manages to depict a not too distant futuristic setting. And the musical score of the film is also strong, even though it cannot compare to the work of Eduard Artemyev, Cliff Martinez manages to create an appropriate mix of emotional and science fiction mood for Solaris. The film is a treat on the eyes and the ears as well as the mind, though the third option is determined by whether or not the viewer has seen Andrei Tarkovsky's version.\nThe one area that Solaris actually succeeds at being better than the original is in the casting of its lead actor. George Clooney is perfect for the leading role of Dr. Chris Kelvin. In a performance which transcends the one given by Donatas Banionis in the original Solaris, George Clooney manages to approach his role in Solaris with a strong sense of emotional involvement in his role. Facing a complicated character but doing it with such humane dedication to the role, George Clooney manages to bring his role to life by convincing viewers that he truly understands the complicated concepts behind the narrative and then developing the character as he faces the emotionally complex nature of the narrative. George Clooney does not play his role as an archetype, he actively pours his heart and soul into the performance by slowly but surely exploring the emotional pain of his character and rendering audiences easily able to sympathise with him for all his suffering. He really puts a lot of depth into the role which single handily makes Solaris a very character driven feature, also meaning that his role in the film is one of the finest aspects of the production. George Clooney proves once again that he works well alongside Steven Soderbergh, and his leading performance is one of the much more sympathetic efforts of his career and potentially one of his finest.\n\nSo while the 2002 adaptation of Solaris lacks the originality, depth and flair of Andrei Tarkovsky's superior 1972 adaptation Steven Soderbergh's directorial work ensures that it is an intelligently written, emotionally gentle and stylish film which looks and feels good all while it is anchored by an extremely touching lead performance from George Clooney.",

            "content": "George Clooney suits up for an adventure into space to investigate the mysterious \"Solaris\" and the state of the scientists observing this galactic phenomenon. The movie is purposefully deep, revolving around philosophical, spiritual, and moral ideas that can be felt in the movie's atmosphere. What is subtly annoying, however, minus the obvious philosophical idea to think about, is that these such philosophical/spiritual/moral ideas are never explicitly pointed at. There is no specific question in the dialogue that outlines the heaviness of the film-- you just know it is there as you watch. Perhaps some of that \"weightiness\" is felt by extended scenes with limited to no dialogue, focusing more on the scene or a specific image. Clooney's facial expressions take a slight spotlight in the movie (which is an acting trait he is adept in controlling/portraying) to show the turmoil and confusion of the events; you can almost feel the emotions themselves by watching his movements. Because the movie tries to \"dig deep\", the plot is straight forward to a fault: narrative dimension is replaced by Clooney and friends' struggling with reality. Disappointingly, there is only small context on \"Dr.\" Kelvin (Clooney)'s therapeutic background-- what is his experience? What are his usual procedures to dealing with these issues? How would he diagnose the situation, etc. Kelvin's backdrop seems like it would add a very intriguing part to the situation, but his profession is barely touched on at all. Another result of near-static-storytelling is the lack of a profound climax. The main event happens... and everything else compliments that drama without providing much more. Although the story continues to unravel, something about its presentation does not give much surprise-- almost as if you are subconsciously expecting the turn of events to happen (the exception being the movie's ending). Yet one more pestering element is the lack of annotation to Dr. Kelvin's thoughts. He does not offer much for you to know what he is thinking or what his thought-process is as he struggles; you find out tidbits here and there as he speaks to other crew members, but it is usually what you would expect him to be thinking, which narrows his character. Bottom line: this film is worth watching if you can persevere through low-intensity storytelling and if you can struggle, as Dr. Kelvin struggles, with the power and meaning of Solaris.",

            "content": "Now, look, I'm not saying that Andrei Tarkovsky's \"Solaris\" was a bit too long, but this adaptation of the same source material follows most of the same beats, except it's over an hour shorter. No, I liked Tarkovsky's interpretation of this tale, but, seriously, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a newer and slicker \"Solaris\", which you know has to be more exciting, seeing as how Steven Soderbergh is by no means known for making glacially slow films. Jokes aside, outside of the surprisingly kind of limp, but still decent third one, Soderbergh's \"Danny Ocean\" films are pretty fun, which, of course, gave me hope that I might find thorough entertainment value in this film, seeing as how it also stars George Clooney, and is about an \"ocean\" planet (Nyuk-nyuk-nyuk). Kidding aside, this is a romantic sci-fi drama that prominently features a planet made of ocean water, so are you really that surprised to find that James Cameron is at least producing this project? Well, to be honest, I was a little bit surprised to find that out, because this film is kind of cheap for a James Cameron production, and I will always remember that because as high profile as this film is, it still underperformed at the box office. Man, this baby lost $17 million at the box office, and I'd imagine that news made poor little Jimmy spit out his Shipwrecked 1907 Heidsieck champagne when he read about it while on the second round of his tri-annual personal cruise to the Bahamas. Well, Jim, my man, I can't entirely blame the people for not seeing this film, because while it is decent, it has plenty of problems.\r\n\r\nThe 1972 film which technically inspires this fellow adaptation of Stanisław Lem's classic sci-fi novel had its share of unique areas, but also got to be kind of formulaic, and let me tell you, the conventionalism in this story has most certainly not died down in 30 years, thus this film is also left to hits its share of tropes that make it predictable, even if you're not familiar with other interpretations of Lem's story, and yet, while this film tells us a bit too much of what we already know, it stands to say more. I opened up this article cracking jokes about how this film is a whole lot shorter than its 1972 counterpart, and sure, this effort is pretty comfortably tight in plenty of places, but at just about 100 minutes, this film trims a bit too much fat around some of this story's edges, resulting in expository shortcomings, and certain areas of undercooking which leave depths to be delivered rather ambiguously. The film's subtle approach to thematic and dramatic weight sometimes work considerably, but on the whole, there's something kind of frustrating about this film's not taking as much time as it should to really flesh out its vision, and yet, wouldn't you know it, even though the film gets to be too tight for its own good, it still makes time for some dragging. Needless to say, this film isn't quite as draggy as its over two-and-a-half-hour-long counterpart of 1972, but its structure often boasts the arty attitude of Andrei Tarkovsky's \"Solaris\", complete with overlong meditations upon nothing but nothing, made all the more aggravating by those classic Steven Soderbergh cold spells in atmosphere, established through quietness, if not all-out silence, behind dry air. The film gets to be too arty for its own good, and I must admit that when artistry gets really overblown, there is a slight breeze of pretense to break up Steve Soderbergh's ambition, which is noble, sure, but misguided in some places, delivering on questionable directorial moves, when not emphasizing plotting's other shortcomings, both consequential and natural. Soderbergh wants this film to be more than what it is, and I most certainly subscribe to such a sentiment, but unlike Soderbergh, I can't say that this worthy vision is spotless, as Soderbergh gets kind of carried away at times with his thoughtfulness, yet cannot obscure the conventionalism and undercooking with an overly steady pace, thus leaving the final product to fall short, almost into mediocrity. Of course, mediocrity does not quite claim this one, because no matter how flawed this film may be, what it does right it does well enough to hold your attention, or at least your eyes' attention.\r\n\r\nThis is a very minimalist sci-fi film, so there's not a whole lot of room to dazzle, but man, production designer Philip Messina delivers the best that he can, tossing in some subtly distinguished details within the handful of moments outside of the \"Solaris Station\" - within which this story primarily takes place - in order to sell you on this futuristic world, while the broader sets, particularly the \"Solaris Station\" set, boast such intricacy that it's hard not to be drawn into this film's environment. The designs of the film are near-dazzling in their sharpness, though that might just be Steven Soderb-oh, I mean, \"Peter Andrews\", because even though this film's cinematography is not as playful with color palettes as many other films lensed by Soder-I mean, \"Andrews\", Andrews compensates with a heavy tone that is unique and rugged, as well as with sparse lighting which plays with darker areas in imagery in a tasteful way that is consistently beautiful, and sometimes stunning. As with plenty of films shot by Andr-oh, forget it-Soderbergh, this effort looks so gorgeous in a way that has to be seen in order to be truly believed, and Cliff Martinez's seriously underused, but tasteful score, - flavored up by hypnotic electronic touch-ups - isn't too shabby either, thus leaving the artistry of this film to stand as almost enough to carry the final product, whose decency is perhaps more firmly secured by acting that is about as tasteful as the artistry. There aren't too many people in this minimalist drama, and what talents you do see don't come accompanied with as much material as they probably should have, but there is strong acting here, and it can primarily be found within our leads, as Natascha McElhone, like Natalya Bondarchuk in the 1972 show that she stole, delivers on an intensity that captures the anguish of the Rheya Kelvin character, while George Clooney's subtle intense captures the uncertainty and other dramatic layers of a man trapped in a claustrophobic environment with a love who he had lost and has returned in the most peculiar of ways. The performances aren't written to be as outstanding as the film's artistry, but like the artistry, the acting is impossible to ignore as a strength which carries the film quite a distance, but cannot craft a truly decent drama alone. Storytelling is messy, and Stanisław Lem's classic story concept is not weighty enough to handle too many blows from undercooking, bloating and overambition, but it is still reasonably worthy, with intriguing thematic depth that inspires a degree of immediate intrigue, reinforced by what is done right by Steven Soderbergh, as director, whose thoughtful storytelling has its share of controlled moments which effectively absorb thematic weight, and even dramatic weight, sometimes to an unexpectedly very moving degree that gives you a glimpse into what this very human and meditative drama could have been, and grows more recurring as the film goes along, until it all comes down to a pretty strong ending whose ambiguity genuinely works as thought-provoking. Were the film more fleshed out and more controlled in pacing, we would be seeing more of these highlights in storytelling and end up with a pretty rewarding film, but as things stand, effective moments break up consistent decency, which is more challenged than it should be by considerable storytelling issues, but ultimately reinforced enough by inspiration to stand firm, even if you do end up hoping for more than just decency.\r\n\r\nBottom line, the film has formulaic areas and undercooked areas, but is most dragged down by, well, dragging, achieved through aimlessly meditative moments, made all the more grating by atmospheric coldness that, with an air of overambition, distance your investment enough for you soak up the shortcomings that ultimately drive the final product to the brink of mediocrity, which is ultimately diverted by excellent production designs, gorgeous, if not breathtaking cinematography, strong performances by George Clooney and Natascha McElhone, and enough highlights in the thoughtful telling of an intriguing story for Steven Soderbergh's \"Solaris\" to stand as a decent sci-fi drama which could have been more, but still gets you by just fine.\r\n\r\n2.5/5 - Fair",

It's one of those films that hints at a link between quantum physics and spirituality, but does it in a tasteful way instead of being all hippy-dippy. Real life tragedies are used as a metaphor for how we supposedly create our own reality and struggle to understand and overcome them.\n\nClooney is a bit wooden and the woman playing his wife is constantly creepy, but in an annoying rather than atmospheric way. Visually it's a great film - beautiful sets and stunning shots of the planet are a real treat to watch. \n\nA somewhat divisive film, but not bad overall.\n\nWatch on TV before you pay to rent or buy the DVD.",

That's not quite a knock, either. \n\nPatience is key with appreciating this movie, but I think it's worth it, and Soderbergh is the perfect person for a remake like this. \n\nClooney is good, as you'd expect, and Viola Davis is decent, too. I also liked Jeremy Davies, whose \"out there\"-ness really brought a bit of levity, while also helping to get the mood right. \n\nThe plot could be a bit stronger, but overall, this is an alright film that fits somewhere in the upper middle of Soderbergh's oeuvre.",

While there, he gets a visit from his dead wife. Most of the story is spent explaining his relationship with his wife, but once you see what happened it turns into a struggle to stay with her, raising the questions \"is it ethical to be stay with someone if they're only a representation of someone you once loved?\" and \"is it possible to fall in love with someone if you, yourself never really knew them in the first place?\". It's really sleek and stylish, everything is silver and in shades of grey. It's a little misleading however, at the beginning it would seem that you're going to be in for a thrill ride, only to unveil a long drawn out drama...And I mean LONG. \r\n\r\nThe Cast: George Clooney, Natascha McElhone, Viola Davis, Jeremy Davies...George Clooney is Chris Kelvin, he's the man sent to the space station only to find that the planet it's orbiting is responsible for some strange activities on board the ship. Not his best performance, but it's a lot better than some of his other works *cough*Batman*cough*. Natascha McElhone is Rheya, Chris' former wife, and representation of his former wife. She gives a good performance as the understanding entity that only wants the best for Chris. I don't think I've ever seen any of her other roles, so this is by default the best performance I've ever seen from her. Viola Davis is Gordon, the tough, no nonsense woman that wants to end whatever it is that's going on, on board the station. A good performance, not as good as McElhone, but still a fairly solid act. Jeremy Davies, plays the part of Snow...Yeah, I don't know what the hell kind of name that is either, I mean really you have Chris, Rheya, Gordon, and then you have Snow...But odd choice of name aside, he's the quiet, smart guy on the ship. He knows and understands the problem better than most of the other characters. A good performance but a little typecast, if you watch him in Ravenous (I'll try to post that review sometime this month) you'll see him playing a near identical character only in a completely different time period and setting. \r\n\r\nOne to Five Scale: 2 \r\n\r\nA decent cast that can't quite compensate for a slow moving and boring story. \r\n\r\nTyler",

            "content": "Actually really quite remarkable - a remake that follows the path set by the original but still exists as something intriguing and unique. Clooney, on fine troubled form, plays Kelvin, a psychologist called to the outer reaches of space on a mission of mercy to help rescue a space crew who have become enraptured by the mysterious planet Solaris that they have been sent to observe. Once he joins the crew, Kelvin quickly realises that the planet is reacting to the study, and may well be doing some analysis of its own. As his memories take on a strange and haunting reality it becomes more and more difficult to keep focus on making the voyage home. Minimalist, hypnotic and disturbing, Soderberg nails the chilly and cerebral atmosphere and the sense of slowly losing grip on reality, and the beats are at first confusing and eventually moving and profoundly disturbing. A powerful, understated masterpiece.",

In this case, Andrei Tarkovsky's original \"Solaris\" is not only held by many as a masterpiece (myself included), but as well as one of the essentials of it's genre.  So Why remake a masterpiece? Well, achieving \"masterpiece\" status doesn't mean the film is perfect, as such a thing is impossible, in Solaris' case the film is obviously made on a budget, and is also an adaptation, meaning the work is simply the view of a single or a single group of individuals, some may love the picture, but want to do something different with the source material.  People seem to forget the 1968 TV adaptation of Solaris by a \"B. Nirenburg\", Tarkovsky himself obviously wasn't satisfied with that adaptation either.  Frankly, i love 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I really wish i could make a remake with flesh eating zombies in there as well...... :D\r\n\r\nSuch is obviously the case with Soderbergh's adaptation of Solaris.  As the film is much more streamlined, and seems to shift the narrative focus from general existentialism to a tale concerned with lost love.  Such a shift gives the picture it's own voice.  However, Soderbergh is obviously a huge fan of Tarkovsky's adaptation as well, as there are several visual nods to his work.  And this is where the picture misses the mark.\r\n\r\nThe picture is telling it's own story, yet is very heavily indebted to Tarkovsky's version.  The parallel's the comparison between the two draws hurts Soderbergh's version.  The plot is streamlined and more focused, but lacks the meat and phycological punch of it's predecessor.  It seems it would have been wiser to make an entirely different version that doesn't reference the original at all.\r\n\r\nThat being said the film itself is kind of a gem in it's own right.  The slow pace at which the film unfolds appeals to the intelligence in the same way Tarkovsky's does, it's not a typical hollywood sci-fi adventure concerned more with the science than with the fiction.  The cinematography is dark, claustrophobic, with entire scenes of dialogue with characters' hidden in shadow, if nothing else, this film looks a thousand miles better than the low budget russian masterpiece.  \r\n\r\nThough it's narrative doesn't quite feel as satisfying as the Tarkovsky adaptation, the fact that the film has it's own voice combined with re-imagined images of the original, make Soderbergh's flawed Solaris a winner in my book.",

And while in her other movies I never gave Natasha McElhone another look, here she shines brightly. She is supremely beautiful, and sad, and disturbing. As she looks right out of the screen she's boring holes with her gorgeous eyes straight into your own, and there's no escape shy of shutting the TV off. She certainly does the job of being creepadelic.\r\nThe love story is worth chewing on as the credits scroll. Was it enough for Kelvin to love his memory and projection of Rheya, rather than Rheya herself? And what is really the difference between existence and perceived existence? If his dead (?) wife were aware that he was seeing \"her\" again and wanted another shot at the relationship they were meant to have, would she be happy? Or sadly repulsed? \r\nThere's also the matter of the \"planet\". I enjoy a good brain exercise, and here is brought the paradox of having it all figured out because you are aware that you do not, in fact, have it all figured out. Do you understand the situation when you are aware that you don't? \"I would tell you what's happening, but I'm not sure that would tell you what's happening.\" The storyteller's attempt to portray higher intelligence, and that we have no idea how to predict how such an One might treat us, is a worthy stab.\r\nThe ending is very fitting as well.

While  Tarkovsky's solyaris and  soderberg's solaris both  shares Stanislaw Lem's novel as source material , it feels like both directors were inspired by the book to create something  truly cinematic  rather than just end up illustrating the text. \nOn Stanislaw Lem's has admitted in his  personal website, the true intention of the book was to to propound what an Encounter with something truly Alien might be like. But both Soderberg and  tarkovsky seems to have drawn in to the human drama attached to the work and movies works largely as psychological drama rather than a science fiction( which is more than often what true science aims to achieve). Soderberg's solaris is a self aware work of art, somewhat similar to works like begman's persona(I am not comparing the stylisitc aspects of the films here but the rather the overall effect). Inexplicable scenarios happens yet the audience and the movie accepts them without questions, because we are hooked more to the metaphors implied by the construct  rather than the construct itself.\n\nSolaris builds up a similar  form like many of the great works of scence fiction. It uses the liberties of a science fiction universe to conjure up  a situation completely alien to humanity and then introduces normal human beings into this world, testing their humanity, constantly questioning  aspects of our psyche that makes us human. The science fiction universe in solaris the movie is spent mostly in a spacecraft inspecting a planet named solaris.  Solaris differs from a normal planet in one aspect-It observes the minds of the humans close to it, finds what is it they have  lost or missed most  and materializes  the loss back to them, which is almost always another human close to us taken away by death. The person  who  we miss most, brought back to us  in flesh and blood, perfect in everyway we imagined them to be. It seems almost  like a dream come true as a possibility , but the moment a human is put in the situation it feels like the materialization of a nightmare. The entire movie is about the way different crew members within the ship responds to this, almost like the way characters in bergman's  sevent seal confronts and responds to the materialization of  death. Once we get past the initial fear of the materialization, what happens next is a desperate urge to protect it, to realise whatever it is that we regret by losing them an turning life back to the way it was supposed to be. And then just as we start finding joy in the illusion we grow conscious about the nature  materialisation; it can never be the person that has been lost to us. Because whatever has been created is just an image of the person, everything that we know about a person and this draws a parallel to the way human reationship works in the real world- we never actually understands a person in true sense. The film explores the limit of human empathy like no other at this point, how well could you know or empathise even the person whom you love  most in this world. Could we ever really  know what or how another person feels at any point  of our lives? All we does is imagine us in their position and think how we may have felt if we were them and all that we know about a person is in real whatever we want to see in them.  The question of the others  the movie poses to us at this point is revelatory enough  to drive us paranoid on knowledge of the self and therein lies the genius of the film.  The film starts by questioning what we know about everything beyond our self and ends by confirming our  hopelessness in the knowledge of the self. \n\nSoderberg has always been a director who explores  the more styistic aspects of storytelling in cinema and I have always felt he would have been acknowledged a greater filmmaker had he belonged to another generation like the new wave where style was accepted as the content.But this one like many great masterpieces has  confirms the notion that storytelling indiscernibly aiding the story is what makes a movie truly great. There are moments in with the present juxtaposed with the past again justaposed with fantasy, all so carefully wrapped up by clever editing where  the whole sequence goes brings out meaning beyond the sum of the images. Soderberds choice of images, the detached quality of the visuals and the music all places the viewer in a meditative state  but the movie at the same time is  very legible, uncompromising and committed to the storytelling that one doesnâ(TM)t need to be a very committed cinephile to be seduced by it. I think itâ(TM)s a masterpiece without doubt,though imdb rating disagrees with me.",

The movie starts off when George Clooney as Chris Kelvin has just lost his wife, Natascha McElhone as Rheya and is in the stages of getting over it.  He receives a message from old associates about an assignment of being sent to a space station orbiting close to a planet called Solaris!  Within' an hour later and seeing illusions of his wife created by Solaris, we soon learned that the reason she commited suicide was because she was expecting, and Chris wanted this to be discussed with him first before any decisions can be made motivating him to abandon her and upon coming back to see her, she was already dead, taking her own life!  \r\n\r\n  As radical as Soderburg wanted to become, he decides to take liberty and somehow change the ending into the beginning.  Assuming that theirs a rotation happening!  After director Soderburgh made successes out of remaking Traffick from the UK mini-series Traffik, and of course Ocean's 11, it'd make sense to him attempting to do this again. By watching this, you can tell Clooney had a say in this film too, since he doesn't advocate any children in his personal life including marriage.  And I knew I didn't like this movie, but I couldn't figure out why this is nothing more than a poor cheap reproduction of the 1972 original, whereas the movie assumes viewers are well aware about \"Solaris's\" functions way before Chris accepted this kind of mission, it was never properly explained about Solaris's capabilities until his illusioned wife became appearent, with viewers asking more questions than viewers receiving answers, such as \"What is Solaris's main intention?\" or \"Is he ever sorry for leaving Rheya in an extremely delicate situation?\", and the other question, \"Is Chris's decision to remain on the Space Station, was that to justify his actions before Rheya took her own life\".  It was those questions as well as more that have viewers scratching their heads, and not worth going to the movies for, rather looking like a tv movie special than anything!  \r\n\r\n2 out of 4",

            "content": "With the handicap of being a remake, Steven Soderbergh's Solaris shares the same plot points and covers the same themes, but it's mood and themes are well captured.\r\n\r\nThe always enjoyable George Clooney stars as Chris Kelvin. Kelvin is a psychologist who is sent to investigate the crew on a spaceship that is researching the planet Solaris. But when he arrives he discovers that most of the crew have killed themselves. The cause of their torment is unknown, but Kelvin is about to find out when his dead lover mysteriously appears infront of him, alive and well. The only significant difference in THIS Solaris is that we get a glims into Kelvin's world and his developing and failing relationship with his girlfriend. We actually see him in  the city and futuristic world, and we get to see the real problem in his personal life. But it's not as much as interesting as it is an explaination for the series of events and emotions. Other than that, we are given the same material the original had already covered. But where the original thoroughly examined it's themes in the 165 minute running time, this 100 minute movie only briefly gives us the right themes and emotions were supposed to get from the story.\r\n\r\nIf there's anyone who could capture the thoughtful but slow pace of Andrey Tarkovskiy it's Steven Soderbergh. Don't get me wrong, I love Soderbergh, and he captures the mood of the story quite well. The slow pace, the sense of depression and isolation, the mystery and psychological horror, all of it is there. But I guess my problem is that as slow and depressing this movie is, which is still very unconventional to other Hollywood movies, Andrey Tarkovskiy's version is a lot more slower, more isolated and depressing, and frankly, the scenes make a lot more sense and have more purpose. Where Tarkovskiy's Solaris had scenes of great symbolism and meaning, the only meaning to the shots in this movie are how cool the animation looks and how depressing Kelvin's life is. The 1972 movie had a lot more meaning. But other than the comparison, this movie does look quite stunning. The spaceship looks a lot more realistic as a spaceship than the original, and I REALLY LOVE the look of the futuristic society. The little changes in technology, and what remains the same today is a great mix of sci-fi and a natural and realistic feel. And trying not to compare the two movies, the directing and cinematography is fantastic as always from Soderbergh.\r\n\r\nIf one never seen the original 1972 Solaris, then they would find this movie very creative and thought provoking. Hell, maybe they would prefer this version because of the aquired taste it takes to sit through the '72 Solaris. But for me, and on a professional level, what this Solaris tries to say and get across, the original did a lot more clearly and effectively. And due to the lack of originality in this movie, I have to deduct points.",

After making his career breakthrough in 1989 with SEX, LIES & VIDEOTAPE, he moved on to direct all the way from a light-hearted heist comedy, OCEANâ(TM)S ELEVEN, to a heavy thriller about disease, CONTAGION.  SOLARIS falls somewhere between heavy and light-hearted.  Itâ(TM)s not an intense, violent understudy about space, nor is it a light-hearted romp around the moon and whatnot.\n\nGeorge Clooney proves once again that when it comes to acting, he simply cannot go wrong.  He has embellished the usual personality onto his character: suave and charming (making it easy to believe him with a woman as attractive as Natascha McElhone), yet with a subtle tendency to go all-out hot-headed.

She's not human!\"\r\n  On the subject of Solaris itself, his friend Gibarian (who's been in the morgue the whole time) comes to him in a dream and chips in with \"why does it have to want anything?\". We're used to aliens either wanting to befriend us or obliterate us, always in a basically humanoid form  - this is a \"what if\" with a much more intellectual and cerebral \"take\" on the possibilities, crossed with a gone-wrong love story which is finally resolved in a 2001-style series of godlike interventions by the planet. \r\nCliff Martinez's bleakly beautiful electronic soundtrack heightens the atmosphere and complements the experience of a film that isn't a barrel of laughs, but isn't meant to be - it's about the underpinnings of the forces that draw us together as humans, and the consequences that arise from them.",

I'd give it 2, a limbo I mostly reserve for typical American films and Adam Sandler, but maybe it's the source material that bumped it up a notch. \n\nIf this film is indeed a direct retelling of either the previous film or the novel, I may be in for some more hurt. But I really think it's Soderbergh's fault. I've never been a fan and now I'm nervous and reluctant about watching Che that I just got on Criterion. Overall, another factor of bumping it up half as star is at least the style. I get where it was trying to go and accomplish. The end product even gives you a somewhat surreal feeling but nothing to really back it up. Maybe that was in due part to the score which was great at first but then really fell to feeling repetitive. I loved the look at least for some parts. The space station was a little dull, too silver and \"look at me it's the future!\" for my tastes. Almost like a studio driven copy cat wannabe poor man's 2001, if that makes sense. \n\nI expected somewhat more from this and was disappointed; I was as disillusioned as the Space-People.\n\nAnd why does James Cameron need 3 assistants if he's just a producer? I suppose assisting him in doing nothing isn't as bad as paying him an offensive amount of money to do nothing. Cameron knows Sci-Fi like Soderbergh knows how to make me care about this movie and what's going on, in a world where the only expression people know to show on their face is confusion. \n\nBut at least I made some popcorn to occupy my time during this one.",

When he finally decides to go, he discovers amazing and terrifying things are taking place that will challenge his own madness. I did like this movie, although the pace was something to be reconsidered. I believe this role was a huge platform for Clooney who has had many more unique and interesting oppurtunities become available for him after this.

Soderbergh's visuals are top notch with some lovely effects complimented by a wonderfully atmospheric soundtrack, creating a very ethereal and other-worldy quality. I must admit, I'm not entirely sure what it is the film was trying to say exactly, but the journey is stylish and captivating. Fans of 2046 should give it a try; they might be pleasantly surprised. A slightly strange film, something like a sci-fi, thriller but with a romantic feel to it? It's well shot, the cinematography is good and the cast is quite strong. The films raises a lot of questions without providing many answers. Some will like it for this others won't. One for sci-fi fans, or those open to debate about life, time, religion etc. I'm sure the girls will like it for George Clooney's scenes as well! It is, all at once, exhilarating, frustrating, cryptic and wise.",

Like the original, Soderbergh completely does away with the technical aspect of sci-fi and focuses intently on human interaction (sometimes with non-humans that may or may not be humans depending on your definition).

Also the leading man behind the camera does a great job in both the script and the directing. The slow takes and slow pacing of the movie helps build tension and drag out each scene so you are not allowed to leave your seat as there is no action codes which tell you when something big is going to happen. Soderbough also makes the film look beautiful with a blend of dark and technoligical cinematography which beautifully contrasts the bright natural feel you get from Solaris which is just outside their windows. The way \"Solaris\" is shot as well is interesting in itself as the angles which Soderbough uses are original and sometimes make you believe you are seeing something you arn't which is a representation of one of the main themes of \"seeing is not believing\".",

In some respects it is hard to conclude what Lem had in mind, but it is clear that Soderbergh didnt grasp any of the main points of the book.\nThis is sci-fi piffle at its finest. Soderbergh it seems wanted to capture the more hard-core science fiction feel of 2001, but fails because he really didnt get the original story (or science it seems), and what he provided was a confused misinterpretation, which essentially contradicts the central ideas of the book...\n\nAll of the science of Solaris (the book) has been removed!!!\nAll reference to the planet is gone (you see more of Clooneys naked ass)....and with it the main premise of the story: do we know as much we  think we do, and can we really explore and understand the unknown in the universe, given how little we truly know of ourselves?\n\nWhile Lem repeatedly references the human tendency to anthropomorphise the unknown and the dangers in doing so, all Soderbergh really does is cash in on such concepts. While Lem suggests Solaris seems to tap into the vast unconscious aspect of the human psyche (whether deliberately or accidentally), Soderbergh avoids all question about the operation and motivations and Solaris, and uses it simply as a vehicle to create a bizarre lovestory, as if Solaris has the ability to fulfill Kelvin's unrequited desires (and as a result by implication that it 'consciously' understands these desires).\n\nWhile Lem tries to explain as much as he can about how the visitors operate, Soderbergh cherry picks their behaviours even allowing allowing them to remember events that could not be part of the memory of the person from whose memories they have been created....\n\nWhile Lem suggests the visitors are derived from the crews' deepest and most clearly defined memories, and consequently emanate from the darkest imaginings or events of a persons life, which the individuals then have to face, Soderbergh even goes so far as to have one visitor be the double of the crewman, just to have a twist near the end!\n\nWhile Lem uses Solaris to show human naivety in exploration, and discusses at length the course of scientific exploration, and provides a very strong sense of isolation, danger and alienation regarding Solaris, Soderbergh provides a cosy comfortable, ordered structured environment, essentially the opposite of what Lem had described.\n\nWhile Lem creates characters on the verge of breakdown struglling to come to terms with Solaris, and incapable of communciating, Soderbergh gives us the standard American group therapy where everyone is oh so happy to share at every juncture...\n\n\nWhile Solaris the book should make you think, Solaris the movie is a major yawnfest!!\n\nOk, so the book would be hard to make into a decent movie, and ok so Soderbergh decided to make a lovestory...but he didnt have to gut such a Science Fiction classic in such a witless manner to do so!\n\nIf you watched the movie and enjoyed it, great!

The cast deliver career-best performances - particularly Clooney, who in the film plays a terribly broken man, unable to move on from the aftermath of a tragic romance.\r\n\r\nThe visual style is stunning, and experimental - as is to be expected from Soderbergh - playing as important a role as any of the characters in delivering the story and themes of this film.\r\n\r\nThe film focuses very strongly on the nature of human romantic love, with a narrative designed perfectly to deliver maximum emotional connection.  Both the space station and Earth city settings are highly un-natural and depressing, adding to the tone of the film.  There is nothing natural, safe or warm in this film other than aspects of the characters, giving a very narrow focus and delivering this well.\r\n\r\nComparisons to Tarkovsky's older version of Solaris are inevitable.  However, both are very different films that happen to use the same novel as their foundation.  Tarkovsky's much longer film explores human love fully - not just romantic love - and our wider humanity.  In doing so, it contrasts the artificial station (and cities) with natural landscapes, resulting in an altogether different film.\r\n\r\nIn short, both versions of Solaris are excellent films in their own right, with different emphases.",

This still exists as a factor even though I felt it did much more explaining than the Tarkovsky picture. \r\n\r\nYou would also have to be predisposed towards material of this nature, which perhaps would be better called \"psych fiction\" in place of \"science fiction.\"\r\n\r\nRegardless, as Cameron says on one of the DVDs special features, the idea is that the source material is more akin to science fiction of \"the 50s and 60s\" with 'ideas and human stories more than ray-guns and robots'. \r\n\r\nA lot of people will find this boring and slow. A lot of people will concentrate on a love story and think it centrally important when it really is up to the viewer to interpret for oneself what is most important to take away from it. \r\n\r\nTo me the \"love story\", if it can truly be called that given the circumstances of self-delusion, incomplete memory manifested as a living being by an unknown force and questioned as hallucinatory or \"not human\", or the consideration that any love may be considered debased in self-delusional self-pity. \r\n\r\nTo look at the picture and merely cast it off as a fearful compromise made by originally brave filmmakers who felt commercial pressure to subvert it to a \"love story in space\" is to denigrate the risks inherent in filming this in the first place. I much more appreciative of the commercial sacrifice, even if original story author Stanislaw Lem takes the attitude depicted. It should also be noted he hates the 1972 work as well. \r\n\r\nhttp://english.lem.pl/arround-lem/adaptations/soderbergh/147-the-solaris-station\r\n\r\nAt that link you can read the author's opinions on the film adaptation.\r\n\r\nAgain, it really comes down to your disposition towards film. If you feel you are patient to allow ideas develop, have a bit of a sci-fi geek inside of you, and appreciate artistic integrity even if it should sacrifice conventional pacing, then you may like this film as I do.\r\n\r\nIf you are more of a type that wants the story to be fully explained, has little patience for psychodrama, and no interest in any imaginings of alternate life forms or their potential communications, then you would likely hate this movie. \r\n\r\nNow, in contrast to the Tarkovsky effort, I did find the building feeling of palpable tension to be diminished in the Soderbergh treatment. It does emphasize feelings of regret, self-loathing, and redemption in loving more so than I felt the 70s version does. While I feel Tarkovsky brought more attention to Solaris as an entity, the modern effects of Soderbergh's time make it look more beautiful. It should be noted that no film did treat Solaris itself with the respect Lem intended. \r\n\r\nI had the benefit of foresight when watching the Soderbergh film that I didn't have when I watched Tarkovsky's, so I must hesitate to claim which I felt did a better job of treating the alien intelligence. Soderbergh seemed to emphasize the feeling that there weren't any solutions, and that humanity wasn't looking for other worlds as much searching for mirrors to itself. It can be argued that these mentions are so briefly touched upon that they are rendered to window dressing status and can be ignored, but I would say this is where your disposition comes in. If it is there, then it can be considered, and in this method of explaining more through telling it can't be denied.\r\n\r\nNow I intend to seek out the book to see what author Lem is going on about. It must be difficult to be an author whose work is adapted by others in ways he finds denigration of his original intent and ideas, but it also may be improved as a whole for other artists to make their representation. I have a feeling that the cliche of book's superiority over film to develop ideas may win out. \r\n\r\nFor I am most interested in the nature of Solaris itself. This is the captivating idea. The human experience exists to help us identify what it might be by how it contrasts from the essence of us.",

I recently re-watched it and thought that the first half was amazing and the second half was absolute garbage. I then re-watched the second half and finally understood why it was a masterpiece and why the ending is absolute perfection, even if it's very hard to piece together exactly what's happening at first. The relationship between the doctor (a top-of-his-game George Clooney) and his dead wife (Natasha McElhone -- the weakest performer in the film) is actually not as compelling as I would have liked or would have expected, but they are not the real core interest of the film anyway. The real character of interest is Solaris, the strange planet that has caused inexplicable things to \"happen\" to crew members aboard the spaceship that orbits it. Solaris is a fascinating character, a complex god, a demon, a simultaneously benevolent and malevolent force with possessive intentions. It can't be fully rationalized because we aren't meant to understand it's scope of power or its ultimate goals, but it's always there; always lurking in the minds of our human protagonists, always making something \"happen.\" Solaris is an absolutely stunning film, beautifully shot with an exceptional score and a haunting tone. It took me 2.5 times to appreciate it, but now that I do, I'm sure Solaris will draw me in for more.",

This one just doesn't fit in anywhere.

Chris learns that his trip is sanctioned by the space program as a security force had been sent to the station to investigate, that security team which is now missing. When Chris arrives at the station, he finds only two surviving team members, Drs. Gordon and Snow (Dr. Gibarian committed suicide), who are both acting nervously. Chris also finds two unexpected people there, the first, who Chris only sees fleetingly, being Dr. Gibarian's adolescent son Michael, and the second being Chris' deceased wife, Rheya. Chris and Rheya had a passionate relationship in all its good and bad before she committed suicide. Apparently, these appearances of loved ones of the crew at the station are what Chris has come to investigate. As Chris, Gordon and Snow discuss and argue about what to do, Chris becomes emotionally invested in this vision of his wife, who herself begins to realize she looks like Rheya, acts like Rheya (including having the same feelings for Chris), answers to the name Rheya, but is not really the Rheya that was once Chris' wife.",

I beg to differ, although regretably I haven't read the book and or watched the first film adaptation, so I'm not sure how much more superior in terms of craft or entertainment they might be. On its own, I find this is much more enjoyable if viewed for its own merits, which include Soderbergh's pretty, focused and experimental direction and a solid lead performance from his frequent collaborator George Clooney, as well as a stellar supporting performance from Jeremy Davies (of \"Saving Private Ryan\" fame). In the end, it's more interesting than entertaining, more idea-provoking than narratively challenging, and more fun discussing than watching, but it's rare to see such an emotionally and philosophically driven science fiction movie with this kind of polish produced by a major studio in the last decade. At the time, Soderbergh was on a big role, so I'm sure his involvement let this most unorthodox flick slip by, as well as help from producer James Cameron, who keeps his more showy and macho style on the sideline and seems to have only influenced the film through some sparringly used special FX. It's more comparable to something like \"The Fountain\" than other big budget sci-fi films, and so if you fall into the category of viewers who like weird, ambitious stories that are purely symbolic instead of by-the-numbers mainstream fare, this should be quite satisfying.",

Personally I consider this movie to be an insightful love story with the milieu of Science as the platform. This definitely requires attention to value the context.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with the central character Chris (George Clooney), a psychiatrist distressed by the loss of his wife Rheya (Natascha McElhone). Shortly a call from his friend/scientist lands him on a space station to a far of planet called Solaris, to investigate some bizarre occurrences which led to death and disappearance of some crew members. The story begins when Chris starts seeing his deceased wife onto the research station and tries to correlate the situation along with delusion. \r\n\r\nI think appreciation should go to Soderbergh for choosing the cast so effectively, who had morphed into the characters through a seamless transition. The chemistry between the two key characters is what made the movie so enjoyable. I think Jeremy Davies also pulled up his part pretty much well. Soundtrack used had some kind of appeal which is very hard to put across in words. Presence of James Cameron as Producer also refined the overall quality of the movie, especially if I emphasis on the production set and the special effects deployed.\r\n\r\nThis is a movie which will not appeal to the universal viewers but to those who have loved movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey as well as 2009s Moon. Again thats my perception; choice is definitely for individuals to make.",

            "content": "How far will you go for a second chance? is the question that Steven Soderberghs latest film Solaris pursues. The plot centers on psychologist Chris Kelvin (Clooney), who is sent as a last ditch effort to recover any survivors on a space station that is orbiting and studying the planet Solaris. \r\n\r\nKelvin arrives to find the commander mysteriously dead, another crewman missing, and two survivors that will not talk about what has happened. Snow (Jeremy Davies, Daniel Farady in \"Lost\") talks in circles (I could tell you what happened, but you wont understand until it happens to you. So theres no point in telling you.), while Gordon (TV actress Viola Davis) will not come out of her room. \r\n\r\nKelvin soon experiences what the others did when he wakes up next to his wife (McElhone) who has been dead for several years. However, time has not passed for her, and Kelvin has to revisit painful memories to make sense of what is reality and what is not.\r\n\r\nExecutive produced by James Cameron and based off the novel by Stanislaw Lem, Solaris is a good comeback from Soderberghs fiasco Full Frontal. It was beautifully filmed by Soderbergh himself (under his pseudonym Peter Andrews) with subtle overall tints of blue. The visual effects of the planet itself are simple but fabulous all the same. Every shot is long and very slow-moving, but that is not to say they are boring in any way. The pace of the film itself (as well as the characters in it) moves along in way that is never hurried, yet it is intense enough to keep the viewer anxious for the next scene.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not the visuals, but the sound (or quite frankly, the lack thereof) of the film that give Solaris its amazing sense of atmosphere. This is without a doubt one of the quietest movies Hollywood has produced. The lack of noise and sound effects in this film is much more effective than the usual explosions and roars that would be typical in other sci-fi films. \r\n \r\nUltimately where Solaris succeeds is the emotional (rather than physical) intensity it radiates. The characters, more often than not, are looking directly into the camera when speaking - a technique usually avoided by most directors because it greatly increases the intimacy between the character and the viewer. The only thing the film suffers from is the surprisingly poor acting by the entire cast except Clooney, who is marvelous in this film.\r\n\r\nThe film was initially rated R due to two scenes of Clooneys nude rear end, but Soderbergh was able to argue the MPAA down to a PG-13. This is a very enjoyable sci-fi film as long as the viewer is prepared for drama rather than action and thrills.",

Clooney has never been better with Natascha McElhone shining every bit as brightly in a very challenging role. The film is aesthetically whole with amazing cinematography, eerily beautiful music and visionary directing; it challenges, enchants and forces you into thinking. It's not as political as Tarkovski's classic, but it's more relevant on a psychological and philosophical level. It's universal and captures something very unique and essential about what humanity is, about what life is or could be.\n\nHere's an example of how science fiction should be made in my opinion.

While the music score is one of the best I have heard, Solaris does not live up too good in the film itself based on the slowness pacing of the film. The plot on the other hand is rather dull but towards the end it just felt dry where it could have much more to explore than rather end pretty much predictable ending.

In fact the movie wants to be something that is new and fresh, but is ultimately nothing more than convention. \n\nOn the plus, Natascha McElhone is hot.

The plot was dull, there was no emotional attachment made with the audience.\n\nI understood the film but at times it became too complicated and you're just asking yourself what the hell.  The movie requires you to make up the story as the movie goes on while the movie in no idea tries to inform you of what the hell.  Clooney is portrayed as a smart character in the beginning of the movie but becomes super weak towards the middle.  I was hoping it'd pick up but it just didn't.  \n\nOne can argue it's a thinking man's film but is it really?  A movie that alienates it's audience?  Even the flashbacks were boring and just didn't even flow well.  It did get me thinking of how life would be if we had to experience Solaris but truly that's the book's idea.  Not even the movie,  I liked how the movie tried to create some connection with its audience but did anyone even understand what's going on?  I felt the film tried to be too artsy for it's own good.  What makes everything worse is that end and the whole heaven crap was just disappointing.\n\nWould I recommend this film?
