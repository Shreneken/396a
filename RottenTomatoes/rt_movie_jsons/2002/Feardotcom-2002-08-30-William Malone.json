This aimlessly creates an incoherent style dampening the expected/envisioned results the formula structured. There's a beneficial style the film tries to tackle but failed in a cheesy matter when nonsensically turned out messy by squandering the prepared ingredients but realized too late amid the climax delivering a satisfying payoff plus decent ambiguity. If the title and marketed plot draws you in promising a potential horrific thriller, best to learn now is to be very observant of the dated briefly peeked style behind an obviously-diverted title. If tempted, you'll find a better coded site than the glitchy, buffering void. (C-)",

At first it seemed interesting, the concept was actually good, there were people dying from being exposed to a \"murder porn\" website, however the plot constantly gained more absurdities until it just collapsed. In the end we were left with a boring old ghost story and hallucinations based on the characters' worst fears.\n\nIf you ask me, I'd like this film if it threw away most of the supernatural elements and concentrated more on the concept of people using the anonymity of the internet to feed their morbid curiosities. To my luck, a movie was made on this subject, titled Untraceable, so if you too are interested check it out.",

She has ties to The Doctor, and now Mike and Terry have 48 hours to find The Doctor and the woman before their time runs out.\n\nHmm...someone who watches something dies in 48 hours by a supernatural being.  Sounds familiar?  Think \"The Ring.\"  Although that didn't come out until years later, the source material, \"Ringu,\" existed in Japan since the late 90s.  Although it doesn't blatantly copy it, there's more than one connection to the film.  I've been told that this is one of the worst films ever made, and I have to agree with it.  Not only is the storyline completely stupid, but most of the film takes place in some of the darkest areas around, so it's difficult to see what's happening (if you cared), and the ending was a jumbled mess - just like the rest of the film.",

Well I can say with that it's a fact that there are far worst films the Horror genre has produced over the years. Obviously the main reason that this film is dismissed so easily is that it shares similar plot lines to The Ring (which came out the same year, the American remake that is). Getting back to this film, I thought it was enjoyable enough to kill time and it was entertaining. However like everyone else, I thought the plot and acting was pretty thin. But as a popcorn horror film, this film works.  Obviously not the best film, but with putting into focus all the other horror films that have come out in recent times, Fear Dot Com doesn't deserve all the flack it has received. The ideas presented in the film have been used before, but still the concept seems interesting. I personally think that the idea of dying in seven days has many angles to a good story. With The Ring it was a video cassette with Fear Dot Com, it's a website.  Both films are good and very entertaining in my book. I wouldn't call Fear Dot Com great, but I would call it a pleasant time waster, which is what it is. This film is way better than a lot of trash in horror nowadays, most notably My Soul To Take. Fear Dot Com is the type of that you have to shut your brain off to enjoy. Mindless entertainment.",

So when I heard about a movie about a website that kills people via a brain hemorrhage exactly 48 hours after they view it, I was glad to hear that finally something fresh was coming to theaters. \r\n\r\nAfter coughing up my $8 on opening night at one of Detroit\u0092s largest theaters, like a kid at Christmas I gleefully made my way to my theater where I was greeted with my first omen of doom: a total of 5 people in a screening room that seats 600. Apparently, we were the only ones that had not heard how vile this movie is.\r\n\r\nThis movie was such a waste: of Dorff\u0092s and Rea\u0092s talents, of moviegoers\u0092 money, and of some of really cool shots and cinematography. Director William Malone (\"House on Haunted Hill\") once again tries to distract the viewer with stunning visuals from the fact that the movie has little logic and no substance. \r\n\r\nThe acting was pathetic. Dorff was so stale that he could have been replaced with a piece of cardboard, and McElhone\u0092s British accent came and went throughout the picture. The only good performance came from the wonderful Stephen Rea, who has been in over 50 films. In all fairness, it is hard to act when the script is garbage, and the dialogue is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are no redeeming qualities for anyone to ever see this film. Ever. Fear Dot Com is sure to crash servers at box offices everywhere.",

            "content": "\"Feardotcom\" fits into the latter category of failed efforts,though I would say it transcends the examples I cited (which really isn't saying much),if only because it sits comfortably in the insulated sewer of horror-genre conventions and clich\u00e9s that provide a suitable reprieve from the stabs at social commentary.Also,had almost exactly the same story as in \"The ring\".The only difference is in which way the victims get exposed.In \"The ring\" it was via a movie-sequence and here it's by a site on the internet.\r\n\r\nWhile the film has one of the horror genre's most creative stylists at the helm and major-studio support,\"Feardotcom\" quickly becomes an absurd, narratively rickety slog through tonal inconsistency.It's true that the script really is not the greatest material available,but come on,really,how can a director can expect us to be scared by a scene in wich Dorff tries frantically to close a elevator door because a bouncing ball is coming fast towards.\r\n\r\nFeardotCom could have been better as it fails to mix the real life internet angle with the supernatural part of the story that well.The film was far too predictable.Everything about it was very predictable,I guessed who was going to die,when they were going to die and (almost) exactly how they were going to die.The plot is so lacking a central focus point,a driver if you will,that at times it is as disjointed as some of the butchered bodies on display.Those strands that do exist are very loose and don't really hang convincingly well together.The end result is that there is no real tension to speak of - certainly no fear.While I did think that the main idea of the website was good,it went nowhere of merit.\r\n\r\nThis film really tried to convice me that energy from computers was what was causing all of this mayhem.That the Internet has a soul that 'travels through the wires', killing off people 48 hours after visiting a website.Maybe if the script was written better maybe they could've sold me on this far-fetched theory.But that didn't happen,which is one of the main reasons why this film is bad.The dialogue is horrid and the acting is wooden.Stephen Rea is the best.He seems to be having a good time and his Alistair Pratt is a villain I truly hated.\r\n\r\nIt's in these moments when he comments on the internet and tortures a beautiful,leather bound victim that the movie is both as interesting as it's going to get and as intolerably sadistic as I've seen from any movie in a long time.Malone inflates this stuff up to hyperbolic extremes.The movie isn't actually scary as it is just manipulative.We sit there nervous and uneasy not because we're scared,but because we don't want to see an innocent women get gutted alive.Stephen Dorff manages to come off not that bad,but Natascha McElhone was nice.\r\n\r\nThe visuals  have really nothing to do with anything that happens in this film.It's not some deep,emotional burden that uses symbolic structures and astounding breakdowns to amplify the viewer's attention span and make them think. This is a thriller with a ghost story.It has no symbolic substance meaning that if you really wish to see how miraculous this film is you have to watch this film in such a fashion that you will be able to absorb the films good qualities,on mute.\r\n\r\nIn general this movie is bad,because it does not correctly handle this scenario and also appears to be much influenced by the movie \"The ring\" and \"Ringu\".\r\n\r\nHere are the figures and what they mean for me when I do the rating. \r\n\r\n100%:Masterful \r\n90%:Incredible \r\n80%:Impressive \r\n70%:Good \r\n60%:Decent \r\n50%:Mediocre \r\n40%:Poor \r\n30%:Bad \r\n20%:Terrible \r\n10%:Abysmal \r\n0%:Worthless",

Instead, we get a crappy silly rehash of The Ring, with the cursed videotape being replaced with a cursed website. Heck, they even see a creepy little girl right before they die! Plus, the way the film was shot was so dark and dingy that I struggled to even make out what was on the screen. So yeah, this film is kind of a waste of time. Very unoriginal and not particularly scary or jumpy or creepy. And the website in it is called Feardotcom. com, not Fear.com, which seems kind of silly to me. I don't know why.

Now, the only way to solve the mystery is to go there himself\u0085 and find the answers before he becomes the next victim.\n\nStupid. The film was so stupid and boring, and combine it makes a shit movie. A lead role, was really bad acted, the plot was stupid, and the ending was really predictable. The film had a really dark feel abut it, which is usually good, but the whole idea of a site knowing everything about you is just plain stupid. What i mean is that how can a site kill you withing 48 hours if it doesn't tell you what it want's. Several times during the movie i just wanted to turn the TV off at how boring it was.\n\nThe plot was really confusing, but did have some nice visual effects, in what the ghosts looked like. Apart from being confusing they're were loads of visable plot holes, and the script should've really be read over several more times before beiung greenlit.\n\nThe acting was average, but one actress Natascha McElhone was appauling. She only used one expression the whole film, and her voice was the same, even when she was supposed to be scared out of her mind.\n\nOverall \"Fear Dot Com\" is boring, confusing and wasn't worth the $40,000,000 budget.

The rain soaked locations evoke serious tension and dread, even when the script doesn't deserve it.\r\n\r\nMalone, who faired much better with his genuinely nightmarish remake of William Castle's gimmicky House on Haunted Hill, deserves better. I hope to see Malone's fantastic style brought to a script that is actually halfway decent.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, you can do worse than a night with Feardotcom.

It was until she discovered boys, that she finally left it behind.\" Come on no one plays with a ball until they are thirteen and how that ball is supposed to scare me has yet to be seen. Actually how any part of that movie is scary is yet to be seen. It rips off a bunch of horror movies like final destination and is very cliche. The acting, editing, plot, and directing are all bad. I like the part were a girl comes up from under a bar table-wth? Basically like the thriller untraceable, but shittier and remove a trace of believability and rationality. I was actually watching the clock most of the time because it was that boring, the only decent part is some scary imaging but it's beaten over the head with a bloody stick.

The acting ranged from bad to mediocre, the directing was quite poor (surprisingly enough it reminded me of the b horror tv-shows which seems to be what the director has been doing before the movie) and the plot seemed rather stupid and I fear it would have gone even worse towards the end (which was one of the main reasons why I got the idea to actually stop watching). I could come up with a couple of mildly positive things but I won't mention them here because I encourage everyone to not watch this. It's simply not worth the effort.
