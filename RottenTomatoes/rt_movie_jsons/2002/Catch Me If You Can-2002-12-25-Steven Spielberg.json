    "summary": "Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) worked as a doctor, a lawyer, and as a co-pilot for a major airline -- all before his 18th birthday. A master of deception, he was also a brilliant forger, whose skill gave him his first real claim to fame: At the age of 17, Frank Abagnale, Jr. became the most successful bank robber in the history of the U.S. FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) makes it his prime mission to capture Frank and bring him to justice, but Frank is always one step ahead of him.",

            "content": "Catch Me If You Can está basada en la verdadera historia del joven falsificador de cheque, Frank Abegnale, y la lucha de un agente del FBI para atraparlo.\nLo que resalto de la peli es la manera de narrar la historia y los hechos, al igual que el desarrollo de los personajes. Algo también notable es la buena actuación, aunque ya sea esperable, teniendo en el elenco a gente como DiCaprio, Hanks y Walken.\nEs una de mis películas favoritas y también de la mejores de Spielberg.",

            "content": "Fazia muito tempo desde a última vez que tinha visto esse filme. Assisti novamente ontem e, para minha surpresa, não achei tão bom, para toda fama que tem. O enredo é excelente e poderia ser melhor explorado, na minha opinião. Nos dias de hoje, talvez até um formato de série cairia melhor, explorando cada golpe do Frank em episódios diferentes. A verdade é que, mesmo em um filme longo, ficou tudo bastante superficial e pareceu que todas as pessoas enganadas eram ingênuas demais, no mínimo. Por exemplo, a maneira que ele consegue entrar em seu primeiro voo.\n\nO filme poderia mostrar mais a atuação de Frank em cada uma das carreiras. Como ele ficava de copiloto/piloto? Ele passou vergonha em algum momento em que perceberam que ele não sabia nada de avião? Ele foi aprendendo aos poucos? Como médico até mostra alguma coisa nesse sentido, mas seria impossível alguém sem conhecimento médico nenhum se manter naquela posição pelo tempo, ainda que curto, que ele conseguiu permanecer. Alguma coisa ele deve ter aprendido para se passar por médico durante esse período. Como advogado, idem.\n\nEnfim, o filme torna esses detalhes que, no meu ponto de vista, seriam super interessantes, em momentos muito superficiais e levemente cômicos, mas simplistas.\n\nO que salva a obra são as atuações maravilhosas de DiCaprio e Tom Hanks. Perfeitos em seus papéis, dão o brilhantismo que, talvez, seja o suficiente para a grande crítica avaliar tão bem o filme. Para mim, no entanto, não chega a salvar as lacunas citadas anteriormente.",

Literally two of my favourite actors. Well, at least I have now and I can only add to the general vibe around 'Catch Me If You Can'. It's very good!\n\nDiCaprio and Hanks are terrific throughout, the former narrowly outshines the latter but the film is very much greater for having them both onboard. Neat to see the likes of Christopher Walken and Amy Adams behind 'em, too. It's as well cast, and as well made, as you'd anticipate from a Steven Spielberg flick.\n\nI potentially would've shaved a little bit off the run time, though that's very much a minor, minor 'but' of mine. All things considered, it's entertaining to watch, has some solid amusement and is told in a interesting manner. I'd happily revisit it, certainly.\n\nA quick look at the real life Frank Abagnale's Wikipedia seems to suggest an equally as intriguing story, with many claims of his potentially being debunked in the years since... yet that, given what has followed them, would simply make him even more of a noteworthy con man!",

This fits with my impression of it the second time around (if, indeed, there was a first time around). It's no surprise that it's technically immaculate - the editing especially impressed me, and of course, the performances are superb throughout. Entertaining and even fun as it is, it all adds up to something insubstantial and lightweight - and that's probably down to the writing. We never really get to the root of why Abagnale does all that he's portrayed as doing, and the breezy tone risks making light of serious crimes - crimes, which as far as the film is concerned, seem to be victimless (which of course they aren't). To that end, it reminded me of a film with the same star - The Wolf Of Wall Street ... entertaining but as light as a feather. Bridge Of Spies I recall felt similar (though I do need to revisit that also ... and that would definitely be a revisit). Spielberg can produce better straight-out entertainment (that doesn't feel so thin), and he can also make 'serious films about weighty themes that keep the viewer gripped. This falls frustratingly between the two.",

Leonardo Di Caprio is solid throughout, as is the always reliable Tom Hanks as the FBI agent in pursuit of the elusive criminal.

            "content": "'Catch Me if You Can' has such a talented cast, the true story is a fascinating one and while Steven Spielberg is an inconsistent director he was a big childhood influence and he has proved several times that he is capable of masterpieces of iconic status.\n\nWhile 'Catch Me if You Can' is not quite one of Spielberg's best films (in a list that sees the likes of 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'ET'), it is one of his better later films, for me that's since 'Schindler's List'. There are occasional lapses into overly-sentimental schmaltz with the depiction of Abagnale's family life, not the first or last time with Spielberg and a long way from the worst case, but that is the one fault that was had for me.\n\nSpielberg directs impeccably, both in visual style and dramatic momentum, a directorial job that just screams of pure class. 'Catch Me if You Can' further benefits from as always beautiful cinematography from Janusz Kaminski and 60s period detail that not only looks sumptuously handsome but also evocative to make one think that it is more than just a film with a 60s setting.\n\nJohn Williams' score is not one of his best or most memorable, but still fits really well and has the right amount of slick jazziness, whimsy and understated pathos without over-emphasising (over-emphasis was the reason why his score for 'Amistad' was a rare misfire from him). The story takes a fascinating story and makes a ceaselessly engrossing film out of it, from the ingenious opening credits sequence to the heartfelt ending, the film is long but never feels it.\n\nThis is further helped by a script that has a deft mix of genuinely funny comedy, poignant emotional moments and nail-biting suspense. The characters are intriguing. Can't praise the performances enough. Leonardo DiCaprio is movie star charisma personified, and brings wit, larceny and charm to a character that is a true crook in every sense but it is easy to see why one would fall for his actions.\n\nIt is easy to overlook Tom Hanks, due to the role being not as colourful or as showy, but he brings charismatic command, generosity and doggedness in a role that could have been really bland and annoying in lesser hands. Of a sterling supporting cast, Christopher Walken is especially superb, particularly in the latter parts of the film as his life is ruined. Martin Sheen and Amy Adams are memorable, and Nathalie Bye solid.\n\nOverall, even if 'Catch Me if You Can' is not one of Spielberg's masterpieces it is one of his better later films and one of his most purely enjoyable ones. Well worth catching. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

As one watches the film, one begins to appreciate him, thanks in part to Leonardo DiCaprio's calm depiction. During the 1960s, Abagnale faked checks and adopted a variety of fictitious identities. Tom Hanks plays FBI agent Carl Hanratty, who is tasked with tracking down Abagnale all across the world. By no means is this Steven Spielberg's finest film, but it is a fun one. There is one moment in particular that is most likely there for comedic relief (hint: it involves shirts). Christopher Walken, Nathalie Baye, Martin Sheen, Amy Adams, and James Brolin all appear in the film. Cool.",

Amy Adams goes over-the-top, and even she adds a decent amount through her character. We manage to see the two main roles in opposition but with mostly positive traits. Though this could easily become boring and flat, the Williams score, decent script, and wonderful performances bring this up.\n\nThough Abagnale was real, the film almost feels like a fantasy due to DiCaprio's character enjoying luxuries and opulence of our dreams as a young, young man.

But right on his tale is the lead HBI agent Carl Hanratty. But Carl always is one step behind.  \n\nThis movie is interesting because it's based on a true story so that adds all the more to it, my favorite part is how it starts off with his father being very successful, than a couple years later his job has fallen out and he can't even get a loan, his mother starts cheating on his father and he realizes right away and knows it's not right, she ends up leaving the both of them and he can't handle it and he leaves home and he goes and learns about being a co piolet and somehow actually starts copiloting, he also becomes a doctor by being charming a flirting with the new front desk girl and she gave him papers that he was not supposed to acquire but he persuade her that he was a doctor. \n\nBut as they say there is no crime that will go unpunished, all along while Frank is enjoying his time there is a lead FBI agent that frank very well knows about, He always seems to be one step ahead of the agent leaving him with barley anything but a little clue it was him, Frank even had him going in circles, messing with him telling him fake names and making it seem like he was on a wild goose chase. But the police officers got the tiniest sliver of a shot to catch him as he was going on a plain and one of his ex-girlfriends that had worked the airlines with him recognized him and called the police. Carl and his team of FBI agents rush to the airport almost missing him and as they were about to close the doors they show up and tell the flight attendance who they are, and they let them in, and they catch him.  \n\nFrank only spends 5 years of his 12 years sentence. After he gets out, he helps the FBI, and he has done it for almost 40 years. I recommend this movie to everyone who is into true crime stories and action movies. It is a real thriller of a movie and puts you on the edge of your seat.",

The soundtrack brings this in a wonderful way (nominated for an Oscar), when up to about half of the film it comes with light and even \"children's\" songs, giving the impression that everything was child's play and happiness. In the second half, when the siege begins to close, the songs become more tense, doing a job in conjunction with photography, which uses cameras that move more, to give the impression of escape and chase. It is notable throughout the film the use of static cameras for the moments when the characters are more relaxed, but when they touch on the subject of police, fraud and being chased, the cameras move, making it seem that at that moment Frank is realizing that his tranquility was being threatened. (Extremely noticeable in the scenes with the father)\n\nAdding it all up, you have a sensational work passing through your eyes, winning not only criticism, but all viewers. A film that I recommend to everyone to watch and that enchants all audiences with its history.",

This is what movies should do — play around with your emotions.

Stellar performances by LDC and Tom Hanks are matched by a lowkey and intriguing turn by Christopher Walken, who manages to deliver each of his lines with subtle melancholy, drawing your eyes away from everything else in each of his scenes. Amy Adams is terrific also, but like Walken, you'll just wish that she was in it for longer. \n\nIt's hard to find flaws, but some do spring to mind. Despite the typical iconicity of John Williams' score, it can often distract you and create the illusion that you're watching a montage rather than a movie. However, I might argue this is beneficial, as it helps the excessive runtime feel a lot less than it actually is. Hanks seems to slip in and out of his New England accent, convincingly leaning into it when he's delivering the poignant knockout blows but then completely forgetting about it when expositing, but I really am nit-picking here. With a denser plot and a few details ironed out, Spielberg would've reached the heights of similar crime flicks made by the likes of the Coens and Scorsese. There's no absence of nuance, either; its unique. You'll either be smiling, laughing, or covering your eyes, and that's a testament to its entertainment value.\n\nYou should watch this film.",

This one is completely different though. It's exciting the whole way through. We seeFrank get himself into some mad situations throughout the movie and Carl's pursuit of him just has so many funny and exciting elements to it. We wonder if he will ever catch his man and if he's going to how is he going to do it? That's the brilliance of a cat and mouse film. You want to see the situations the mouse gets into and how the cat is going to outsmart him. There's no doubt Frank is extremely clever but we sometimes forget Carl is almost at his level too. \n\nThe fact this movie is based on a true story is something that I love. How the hell did Frank get away with some of the cons he did. Imagine this happen in modern day?! It would be all over the news. there's no way on earth it could happen. A random man infiltrating the cockpit of a plane and pretending he's a pilot?! How would you ever be able to do that now?! How did he get away with it then?! The situation's he gets himself into are just madness. I think for me especially knowing this is based on true events just makes that film that much better. \n\nLeo and Hanks have some absolutely incredible movies in their libraries. For me though this is definitely up there in both of there film histories. They are two of the best actors of our generation and all time. To see them go head to head in a film like this is brilliant. They work expertly together. On top of that Spielberg's direction is perfect. He creates such a magical feel about the movie and it makes the story that much more special. He's always been a master of that but here he has two acting greats to work with as well. \n\nCatch Me If You Can is one of those films you must see. It's clever, witty and brilliant. It is one of those movies though that does get forgotten sometimes though. It shouldn't be. We all see these three as pioneers of the movie world. This movie for all three of them is among their best. There's a reason for that. It's a excellent movie that stands the test of time. Hollywood is obsessed with true stories in cinema these days. This film came out before that craze really started. It was and still is one of the best true story adaptions we've ever seen. \n\nCheck out my site LifeLowdown.com for more Film & TV news!",

However, Christopher Walken is the true standout in the film, with his supporting role as Frank Abagnale Sr. There is an assured direction from Spielberg, with tension humour and drama when it is needed. My only complaint is the film slows down and drags a bit after Frank is sent to prison. This would have been family.a better film if it were 10/15 minutes shorter overall. Moreover, some parts of the movie feel to contrived and over-sentimental for what it was going for.

I think the best thing about the movie is the performance of Tom Hanks as an FBI officer. catching the boy becomes an obsession and although it takes longer than expected, he manages to get it.

But let's not short the movie of its own dramatic worth. At its heart, \"Catch Me If You Can\" is not just the story of a young man forging convincing checks. It's the heart-breaking tale of the fallout that a broken home can leave lingering within the lives of its children, with the fallout in Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life namely resembling an addictive urge to cheat, steal, and run. The movie really wants us to remember this and I'm glad it does. This is also magnificently structured and executed on a screenplay front, featuring numerous twists, turns, and surprising scene dynamics that made me jealous as a screenwriter. And Spielberg's effectively expressive, period-focused direction almost needs no mention -- it's terrific work as per usual. In fact, this whole film is a terrific ride from start to finish.",

For a crime film, the soundtrack was so f$%king good, kudos to you John Williams. However, the negative that got me was that it didn't follow with the book 100% which is both good and bad. It makes it new and cool that you don't exactly know what's going to happen next, but somehow not following the book you took three months to read is a little disappointing. Also, the beginning, if I hadn't read the book, I would've been confused because events just sort of happened pretty fast.

The shots are great, he knows how to get the most out of each scene, and the actors perform strongly for him. Leonardo DiCaprio (Frank Abagnale Jr.) is incredible. He became a household name in the late 90s, but it wasn't until his 2002 combo of this and Gangs of New York that he burst out as a great actor. He balances the cocky charisma of the character with the struggles of a kid who just wants his family back together. Tom Hanks (Carl Hanratty) is also top notch. You get the sense that his a no nonsense guy who is easy to root for. Christopher Walken (Frank Abagnale Sr.) delivers in a big way and each scene opposite DiCaprio is a wonder. The smaller roles still get great performances from the likes of Amy Adams (Brenda Strong) and Jennifer Garner (Call Girl). Though it's a true story, it gets the drama right. Too often these films miss that mark. Here, you truly get sucked into the scenes, even if you know what's going to happen. Also, it gets overlooked, but I really liked the cinematography of this film. It's nothing mind blowing, but it feels very fitting of the tone of the movie. Though it runs over two hours, it mostly flies by and is an easy watch. \n\nWeaknesses: While it is an easy movie to sit through, it could've been much easier if a few scenes were cut. There are a handful that feel more like padding than something pivotal to the tale. It isn't a big gripe, but it's one that is big enough to keep this from a perfect score.\n\nOverall: Steven Spielberg delivers one of his best films ever. DiCaprio is ridiculously good in this, with Hanks, Walken, and more providing strong work alongside him. A fantastic cat and mouse chase movie with charismatic characters. Instant classic.",

Coming from his broken home and trying to make something of himself is a true underdog story. This kid that has the mental capacity to do whatever he wants, does just that. Creating new identities to commit fraud and start a new version of crime in the world. The story between father and son is heart breaking but at the same time compelling. The father that wants nothing but the best for his son, and the son that wants nothing more than to help his father. A true masterpiece of storytelling. The score by John Williams is a perfect fit for the film as well. the main theme that is laid throughout the film triggers the cat and mouse game that DiCaprio and Hanks are playing. ",

Amy Adams is adorably sweet and naive in this early role of her's.

The beloved director changed the course of cinema history by reinventing movie storytelling with his sharp ability to turn any tale into an adventure brazen with energy and heartbeat. In this 2002 crime-thriller masterpiece, Spielberg pays homage namely to Hitchcock, directing a wildly entertaining man-on-the-run film with virtually every element perfected. DiCaprio, already a Hollywood favorite at the time of its initial release, exceeds expectations with his portrayal of real-life caper & IRS super-villain Frank Abignanle - his performance never lacking charm, intrigue, or charisma. Hanks is the other side of the coin, Carl Hanratty, an FBI Agent almost too-good for his own job who's dedication to the chase is seemingly all he has. The two have screen chemistry to right the books, despite only appearing on screen together a handful of times, and both actors portrayal of their characters never lack spirit or magnitude. Spielberg explores the expertly-written script by Jeff Nathanson to adapt a film that is thoroughly gripping as a thriller and ceaselessly charming and funny (marking his own signature now idolized by any current director). Everything in this movie works right, with outstanding performances across the board and amazing directorial work by Hollywood's favorite man behind the camera. This is a film that can be revisited every so often and still manage to renew that same charm that it had at its debut over 15 years ago, seeming to have not aged a minute. Arguably one of Spielberg's finest directorial accomplishments that will remain a masterpiece.",

I instantly latched onto the story and enjoyed going on this adventure with Leonardo DiCaprio. Somehow I instantly like him despite the fact that he continuously breaks the laws and lies to people. His journey is one that totally enthralls me, and Im always surprised with how clever he can be. I find it even more impressive because this is all based on a true story. Some of the tricks he pulls feel so simple that I find myself wondering why everyone didnt do the same back then. But its not just the forging of the checks that I enjoy, he also has some great scenes where he simply presents himself as another person and it comes across so natural that you feel like anyone could do the same.\n\nTheres extra magic in Catch Me If You Can, though, because we get to see the other side of the crimes. Tom Hanks absolutely owns the character of Carl Hanratty, and makes the pursuit of Frank Abagnale just as exciting as the main story. Perhaps the greatest scene of the entire film is their first encounter with one another. Every second in that scene is tense, but also funny, and the two actors are at the top of their game. The strange bond that develops between these two characters adds so much to the story, and pays off in such a remarkable way. You can feel the mutual admiration between the characters despite the fact that one is trying to hunt down the other, and somehow that final showdown becomes touching, even though they have been at odds the whole film. Admittedly, a lot of this works because of the groundwork that Christopher Walken sets up as Franks father.\n\nSpielberg deserves a ton of credit for perfectly nailing the tone of the film. In the hands of another filmmaker I could see Catch Me If You Can becoming a dark film that shows the depression in Abagnale as he has millions of dollars but cant attain happiness. Instead we get a light adventure film that touches on those themes, but never feels the need to torture the audience with them. John Williams delivers a score that is original from his other work. It fits the film perfectly, and has a number of melodies that got stuck in my head for hours after watching the movie. But I wouldnt say Catch Me If You Can is 100% flawless. It has some moments that dont flow quite right, and there are a few scenes that feel like they could have been cut because they add nothing to the story being told or just repeat things we already knew. However, its only my hyper-critical subconscious that notices those things, because most of the time when watching this movie I have a great time!",

Supposedly, that was the real French prison where they put Frank. If that's the case I don't know how he didn't die due to the state of it, it looks filthy and unmaintained.\n\nWhat a great mentor and a role model he had as a father. I almost can't believe this guys story. How was able to con and fraud all these people. I guess you could get away with it much easier than you can nowadays. I wish Frank's dad wasn't going through the bullshit he was going through with the IRS, scumbags. Tom Hanks' character is intersting. Amy Adams is cute in this movie, almost child-like.\n\nWhat a genius cover up using all those girls as flight attendants to get through the airport unnoticed. Tragic what happened to him where his parents divorced, his mom started a new life with one of his father's friends, and then his father's passing. Jeez.\n\nYou imagine getting an offer like that? What would you say? To work for the very people who were trying to bring you down.\n\nOverall, great cat and mouse chase story that's based on a true story. Also a great movie about a man's life and his story.",

A common complaint is that it drags on at the end but you get so into it and it is so well paced that I don't personally see it.

I feel like after watching some of Adam Sandler films, it'll be time for a break and watch something else, like Catch Me If You Can for example, which is an excellent film. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a terrific performance that I'm glad that he got nominated for an Oscar, and Christopher Walken too which surprised me. Tom Hanks usually does a great job in terms of his acting, and Amy Adams in her early role is impressive of acting like the type of girl in the 60s. The writing by Jeff Nathanson is well written that I got know about Frank Abagnale Jr, his father, his mother, and Carl Hanratty. The movie does a good job of showing that even when Frank does the illegal stuff, he's still just a kid, and with his backstory, he goes through an emotional time. The score by John Williams is very different from his usual in the way that he used Jazz in this, and it really makes the film feel and sound classier. Catch Me If You Can is a very entertaining film that I really haven't seen films that show the bad and good side of a criminal.",

Leo does have more screen time, and he stands out as being a great actor and filling all of the interesting roles he takes up on the spot to avoid capture or make some extra bucks.  Hanks character is just as good, in a less seen but respected role where he hunts down Leo.  The movie does jump around a little bit, and spoils Leo's capture from the get go, however the ending is still different than we could have expected anyways, so it all turns out ok.  The script is good and convincing, and Christopher Walkin's appearance as Leo's proud but sad father is nice, and he does well also.  It's a non stop movie throughout, there's always something to hold your attention, not with action, but a chase, or good dialogue, an funny scene, or whatever it is it's all interesting and intriguing.

It's just a lot of fun watch DiCaprio escape from his poorly designed plans time and again through either his mouth or actions. Tom Hanks is also great- as he often is when teaming up with Spielberg- as the cat in the cat-and-mouse story of the two characters. There's a brilliant scene where the two are on the phone with other and Frank has a profound realisation that, as much as he wants to evade Hanretty, what he does is defined against Hank's character. Abagnale needs him as much as Hanretty wants to catch the con artist.\n\nIt comes in at 140 minutes but the running time flies by. Such a brilliantly watchable film.",

So when I watched this, I knew the basic (based upon a true) story of Frank Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young con artist who perfected the art of bank check fraud and identity deception, posing as a co-pilot, a doctor and lawyer while running from the law. The law in this instance is FBI agent Hanratty (Tom Hanks).\n\nRunning almost 2 hours and 30 minutes, this movie seems quite long. But director Steven Spielberg managed to craft a film that is entertaining and well-paced, so it never feels like a drag.\n\nAdd in superb acting from the two leads as well as supporting actors Christopher Walken and Amy Adams, and you have a winner. There's not much else to say about this movie. I could go on about the story, but I won't spoil it here nor do I have any criticism. \n\nThe production of this movie is top notch, so there's no problem in that area either. There's only one thing I am left wondering. Not saying he should get it for this one, but why did Leo DiCaprio never win an Academy Award for his acting?\n\nPros: Great story, great acting, great production\nCons: None, really\nVerdict: This was good!",

In fact the film is cleverly structured to allow us to see his side of the story, how he got where he did, and the consequences of his actions. Christopher Walken, always a welcome addition to any movie in my opinion, is surprisingly emotional as the loving father, and Hanks is a character we initially love to see disappointed, but his dogged determination and resourcefulness create a level of appreciation for him as well.

The son of a businessman and con-man, Frank Abagnale Sr, the lives of the Abagnales are thrown into chaos when they lose all their assets through a tax fraud investigation. Shortly afterwards, Frank's parents get a divorce and Frank runs away from home. Forging cheques and convincing the world that he's someone he's not, Frank poses as an airline pilot, a doctor, a lawyer and a James Bond-like figure as he fights to stay one step ahead of the FBI and Agent Carl Hanratty.\n\nThe film is solidly anchored by the performances of the two leads - Leonard DiCaprio and Tom Hanks. Adding to their performance is a star-studded supporting cast that includes such names as Christopher Walken, Amy Adams and Martin Sheen, alongside early bit-roles for Jennifer Garner and Elizabeth Banks, and a small cameo by the real-life Frank Abagnale Jr.\n\nThis film, admittedly, doesn't have the weight of some of Spielberg's 90's output (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, etc), but that's not a bad thing, having more of the Indiana Jones feel of Spielberg's earlier work. The dialogue moves the film along at a cracking pace, and it's very hard to look away.\n\nA really fun movie. You can't argue with that.",

Tom Hanks and Leo DiCaprio are charismatic enough to keep things lively and entertaining, but their roles feel so stiff and rails-bound that there isn't room for them to add much in the way of extra spice. For the most part, the film's happy to ease back into simple escapism, embracing DiCaprio's shameless con-man tendencies as heroic and admirable, even when the repercussions couldn't have been pretty. Particularly uncomfortable is his stretch in residency as an MD, largely played for laughs, where he toys with more than just bankers' checkbooks. Christopher Walken appears in a throwaway role as the escapee's hard-luck father, but fails to pluck any of the intended heart strings and thus barely registers as more than an extended cameo. Satisfying at times, especially when it's inspecting the hard work and tireless attention to detail that's essential to such dirty work (not to mention the rewards), it whiffs on any aspirations to challenge grander themes.",

            "content": "It baffles me as to why CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (2002) does not get more attention. We got DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, and Christopher Walken acting in a Steven Spielberg directorial and it's based on a true story... Does that not sound extremely awesome? This is such an overlooked film, yet I would say that it has one of the best performances from DiCaprio and Hanks, and is one of Spielberg's best too. Catch Me If You Can is a crime drama based on an autobiography written by Frank Abagnale Jr.-Abagnale (played by DiCaprio) was a former criminal who successfully performed cons with forged checks and posed as a Pan Am Airway pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer all BEFORE the age of 20. And surprisingly enough, the real Frank Abagnale actually responded positively towards the film despite not really being a big part of the production in general.\n\nI would definitely say that Catch Me If You Can is one of the funniest crime films ever. That's what I love about the movie so much-not only is it a fascinating story filled with astounding performances, but the film also has a lighthearted tone and it is not as dark as movies like American Gangster. I had so much fun with this film, it's hilarious and enjoyable, but it still has dramatic moments and that sense of realism that kept me engaged with the actual storyline. Catch me If You Can really deserves some more love.\n\nThis was actually DiCaprio's first critical hit since Titanic (which also happened to make $2 billion dollars). He blew me away with this movie. Honestly, I cannot believe how phenomenally good he was here and I would definitely rank his portrayal of Abagnale Jr. as one of his best performances to date. I mean he's acting alongside Tom Hanks yet I would still say DiCaprio upstaged Hanks nonetheless. His performance can be split up into a comedic side and a dramatic side (which really shows off towards the end). The latter was brutal, quite literally amazing. The level of range that he brought to this movie is unbelievably astounding yet ten years later he's still improving and he's still throwing himself out there at these risky roles. Now to Tom Hanks-don't we all just love Tom Hanks? For one thing, I loved him in this movie. Actually, his character's name, Carl Hanratty, is not the real name of the FBI agent that was attempting to arrest Abagnale; his real name was Joe Shea, but it got changed in the script for unknown reasons. I don't know if I need to say that much about Tom Hanks because you know he's going to hit it out of the park and give another fantastic performance. He and DiCaprio had great chemistry though-one of my favorite scenes from the film was when Abagnale had called Hanratty on Christmas and just watching their conversation play out, I kept wondering, \"Who's gonna win this time?\" Even before the end of the film, I immediately realized that these guys started out as enemies but they became friends really quickly; they developed a true bond despite not having interacted face to face many times before Abagnale's arrest.\n\nNext we got Christopher Walken- Now be honest here, how many people have attempted to impersonate his voice? But seriously though... Wow, Christopher Walken was awesome in this movie! He played Frank Abagnale Sr. and I really wish he was in the film more because Walken was, to put it simply, great! Without a doubt deserved his Oscar nod (now and then I switch sides on whether or not Hanks should have gotten it). Also in Catch Me If You Can was Amy Adams. And I'll admit this, I never knew Amy Adams was in the movie until a few years after I first watched it; when I actually found out, I had this huge \"Holy shit!\" moment because I am a massive fan of Adams as an actress, she's definitely one of my favorites working today (and she's also hot). I wouldn't say her portrayal of Brenda Strong (who almost became Abagnale Jr.'s wife) was utterly amazing, she was definitely overshadowed by DiCaprio and the others. Then again she's not in the film THAT much, but for the segment that she's in I thought she was good.\n\nNow a lot of this film would not have worked unless the script was spectacular, which it was anyway. Surprisingly, the screenwriter, Jeff Nathanson, is also the writer of Speed 2: Cruise Control (which I've chosen to never see), Rush Hour 2 (awesome movie), and later wrote Rush Hour 3 (good for the first 20 minutes). In between he had Catch Me If You Can, so in essence a fairly mixed bag if you ask me. Thankfully for this film his script was hit, because without it a lot of Catch Me If You Can would have been ruined. Granted you have Spielberg directing so there's a 99.999% chance it will be great. But let's not forget John Williams' masterful score. I won't even go any further on this one, it is John Williams. Do you expect anything other than masterpieces from this guy?\n\nI'll end this review saying the same thing with which I started: Catch Me If You Can is a phenomenal movie that is underrated among the other films of the crew involved. It's a true gem that definitely deserves more love from everyone. The movie even has cameos with Jennifer Garner and Elizabeth Banks! I highly recommend checking this movie out, especially for the performances and to see how Spielberg amazingly executed that lighthearted tone with one of the best crime dramas of the 2000's - 9.7/10",

            "content": "In my review of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, I spoke about the misconception that darker films are inherently better or more substantial. If Steven Spielberg's film demonstrates that darkness can severely backfire in stories of a light or silly nature, we might logically assume that the opposite is true - namely that a serious (or in this case factual) subject matter can be handled in a fun, light-hearted way while still getting its substance across.\n\nThis brings us on to Catch Me If You Can, a later Spielberg effort covering the early life of teen fraudster and con artist Frank Abagnale Jr.. It takes the potentially grim and gritty subject matter of confidence tricksters and spins us a merry yarn about the excesses of youth whose protagonist is always empathetic. While it perhaps doesn't go as far into its subject matter as perhaps it could have done, it's still a sterling piece of entertainment with a lot of heart behind it.\n\nCatch Me If You Can has an interesting production history, in which any one change could have drastically altered the finished product. Having been passed around the studios for 20 years since the book rights were first optioned in 1980, the project began to gain traction in 2000 when David Fincher signed on to direct. Fincher later jumped ship to make Panic Room, being replaced first with Gore Verbinski, then Lasse Hallstrom, Milo Forman and finally Cameron Crowe before Spielberg himself opted to direct.\n\nIn each case, the director's subsequent output gives us some idea of how they would have approached Abagnale's story. Fincher would have brought an edgy undercurrent to proceedings, focussing on the mental state of Abagnale and the ease with which he was able to fool the system. Verbinski would have handled the story incompetently while doing some justice to the period detail, just as he would later do with Pirates of the Caribbean. Both Hallstrom and Crowe would have made things much more sentimental, playing up the father-son relationship at the expense of the actual cons. And Forman... well, on the basis of Goya's Ghosts, it would have been rather dull.\n\nIn the end, Spielberg was the right person to direct this film. Regardless of his reputation or the influence he wields over the industry, the story of Catch Me If You Can is perfect for his sensibility. It has many of the elements which have characterised his best work: light-hearted adventure, a celebration of American values, a son searching for his father and a  dry, often joyous sense of humour. While direct comparisons with Indiana Jones are a little misleading, this is as close as he's come to Indy for some time, at least in terms of entertainment.\n\nThe first big success of Spielberg's film is putting us in the period. The opening credits are quintessentially 1960s, with animated versions of the characters dancing out of the way of the various names. John Williams' score is playful and upbeat but with a whistful undercurrent, bringing to mind the iconic theme music for the Pink Panther series. While Monsters, Inc. used the 1960s look as juxtaposition to its funky CG animation, Catch Me If You Can uses it to great effect to acclimatise us before we've even seen our leads.\n\nThe good visual work continues after the credits with some lovely period details. Janusz Kami?ski, who has worked with Spielberg since Schindler's List, offers up a colour palette of appealing pastel colours, harking us back to a more innocent, carefree time. Having been a teenager in the early- and mid-1960s, Spielberg clearly has a firm understanding of the fashions, manners and institutions of the period. No skirt seems too short, no car too modern, and no expression out of context or added purely to make the characters seem old-fashioned.\n\nWhile it doesn't revolve around the FBI enough to properly constitute a spy thriller, Catch Me If You Can is still the closest that Spielberg has come to making a James Bond film. He'd expressed an interest in doing so after 1941, with George Lucas pitching the original idea for Raiders of the Lost Ark as \"better than James Bond\". The film is fantastically paced so that two-and-a-half hours just fly by, with the thrill of the chase being beautifully balanced by more thoughtful and suspensful moments.\n\nIt would be foolish, however, to think that Catch Me If You Can was all about surface, with no deeper ambitions other than recreating the period setting or providing a thrilling chase. Arguably the best thing about Spielberg is his ability to convey meaningful, often complex ideas through scenes and stories which appear to be totally frivolous. In this instance, he returns to one of his familiar themes of a father-son relationship, using a familiar device in his work to tease out the deeper motivations behind Abagnale's tomfoolery.\n\nMuch like E. T. twenty years before it, Catch Me If You Can examines how divorce can severely impact the well-being of the couple's children. In the midst of Frank's great capers, which con honest people out of millions of dollars, we get scenes of Frank having often torturous discussions with his father, whose fortunes decline as Frank's rise. These meetings are a device on Spielberg's part: in reality, Abagnale never saw his father again after leaving home at 16. But the change comes with the blessing of the real-life Abagnale: even at the height of his exploits, he would fantasise about his parents getting back together.\n\nFrank begins conning as an act of determined rebellion against the old order. He sees his father, an upstanding pillar of the community, suffering as he goes through life doing things the right way; as much as he loves his father, he resolves never to end up like him. There's a through-line with Goodfellas here, with both films justifying their protagonists' illegal lifestyles on the grounds that living a legitimate life causes more trouble and unnecessary effort. Equally, there's a comparison with Death of a Salesman, with Leonardo DiCaprio standing in for Biff and Christopher Walken doing a very fine job in the tragic role akin to that of Willy Loman.\n\nBut while Martin Scorsese's film was deeply ironic and sought to deglamourise the life of Henry Hill, Spielberg actively courts our sympathy for Frank's actions. Spielberg commented in interviews that people were \"more trusting\" in the 1960s and that the film wouldn't be deemed instructional to con artists of today. While this latter statement is definitely true, there's no denying that the film is far more sympathetic towards Frank than it is towards the FBI agent hunting him down. Carl Hanratty is depicted as being like Frank's dad: seperated from his wife, driven by work, doing his best but still on the losing side (until the end).\n\nWe might dispute the value of being so sympathetic, given the differing intentions of the stories and the nature of their protagonists. But one area where Catch Me If You Can does falter a little is the mechanics of Frank's forgeries. It explains the cons in enough detail for us to follow, but it always puts the thrill of the chase over a deeper examination of how Frank managed to pull off any one scheme. On an intellectual level, it's much more Lethal Weapon 2 than To Live and Die in LA.\n\nWhile there is an awful lot of pleasure to be mined from just following the chase, there are moments in the film when we are conscious of Spielberg substituting depth for something less enticing. There's no issue at all with Frank seeing his father on a regular basis, but the fact that he keeps running into Carl on Christmas Eve is so contrived that even Frank Capra wouldn't touch it. Likewise, the ending drags a little, with Frank attempting one last escape in the midst of coming to work for the FBI. Had this section been trimmed, the film might not have needed the end cards explaning Abagnale's actions after reforming.\n\nUltimately, these problems are allayed or rendered somehow less important through the charm of the central performances. DiCaprio's early career had seen him pandering to his pretty-boy image, but here he strikes a very good balance between fresh-faced charisma and emotional depth. Tom Hanks, fresh from a more demanding turn in Cast Away, turns in a typically fine performance as the downtrodden, long-suffering and frustrated Hanratty. Most impressive, however, is the Oscar-nominated Walken, who keeps things reined in tight to create one of his most meaningful performances in years.\n\nCatch Me If You Can is a rollicking good romp with a good amount of heart and a trio of fine male leads. While it's ultimately as light-headed as it is light-hearted, it does get to grips with some of the deeper issues with Frank's lifestyle as well as serving up much in the way of thrills and spills. While it's not Spielberg's best film by any stretch, it is a good example of how good he can be when he just decides to have fun.",

This soon attracts the attention of Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks, an FBI agent determined to put Frank behind bars. He enjoys being pursued by Carl and even goes far as to chat to him once in a while. While posing as a doctor, Frank falls in love with Brenda Strong played by Amy Adams who works a candy striper. When he asks Brenda to marry him, he assumes a new identity to impress her father Roger played by Martin Sheen who happens to be the District Attorney of New Orleans. While this movie is trying to be as historically accurate as possible as always and it does, it has the breezy sense of direction that Steven Spielberg still holds to this very day. Catch Me If You Can gets a 9.7/10.",

We then travel to six years earlier where we get a back story of franks life with this family that eventually breaks over time and then we see how frank becomes the man who forges checks. Carl picks this up and begins to try and get this kid and we get our movie. \nThe film, probably one of Spielbergs best movie in a long time and one of my personal favorites. The way he filmed this movie, the set pieces and the music was just right on cue. Only Spielberg could have pulled this off. \nLeonardo plays frank fantastically along with Hanks being the FBI agent with a funny persona and yet serious on finding this kid who in my opinion becomes like a father figure because they get close during this chase. \nGreat movie, great Spielberg movie, and one of the best movies that I enjoy a lot. I definitely recommend checking this film out at least once because it's definitely underrated in my opinion.",

And picking a director to tackle the project is a challenge, but luckily enough Steven Spielberg was available. He manages to explore the whole world of Frank Abagnale Jr. very well by taking the view of both him on the run and the man in pursuit of him, ensuring that a broad view of the story is imposed. Steven Spielberg's direction makes this biopic a deep and stylish one which is unforgettable and strongly has us supporting and sympathising with Frank Abagnale Jr. who is portrayed as a strong character through Steven Spielberg's direction, the scale of and natural flow of the story combined with its strong production design and on top of it all, Leonardo DiCaprio's excellent work as the main character in some of his finest screen work to date. \nIgnored by the Academy Awards for some strange reason, Leonardo DiCaprio reminds us why he is such an excellent actor by paying tribute to Frank Abagnale Jr.\n\nTom Hanks was charming as Carl Hanratty\nChristopher Walken gives some of his finest work in years in Catch Me If You Can and gives a strong background to Frank Abagnale Jr. by characterising the man his father was and therefore who he models himself after. His performance is simply strong and meaningful, and gives a good basis for Leonardo DiCaprio to get started with.\nAmy Adams gave one of the finest performances of her career and she is an unforgettable screen presence in Catch Me If You Can as she conveys an immaculate level of innocence and sweetness in her portrayal of Brenda Strong, and it enhances the viewers ability to sympathise with Frank Abagnale Jr. as I found myself falling in love with her the same way he did. She was just all too good in Catch Me If You Can, and it's another performance snubbed from the Academy Awards. At least she went on to earn another three nominations in no time, and she undoubtably deserved them.\nNathalie Baye and Jennifer Garner also supply strong supporting performances, as does Martin Sheen whose genial presence provides a flood of nostalgia for viewers. It's just great to see him up on screen again.\nCatch Me If You Can is simply a very very interesting story and is told excellently well, and loaded with a talented cast it survives on its feet for the entire running time.\nCatch Me If You Can also features a good Soundtrack which is atmospheric and capturing of the time that the film follows, and the cinematography in Catch Me If You Can is also terrific and excellently mood setting.\n\nBasically, Steven Spielberg combines his skills for a large scale story with his ability at creating strong character-driven content, and in good hands Catch Me If You Can is a charming and clever success all around.",

The thing here is that he did all of this before he was 21.\nThe movie starts off with a game show talking about why he did all of this. Then it goes to Frank in French prison in 1969, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He tries to escape but the flashes back to 1963 with his father, played by Christopher Walken, winning some kind of award. Later his father is investigated for tax fraud.\nAs his father slowly loses his fortune and gets divorced Frank runs away. He learns coning from some tips his father did earlier in the movie.\nAfter coning as an airline pilot he starts to get the attention of an FBI agent Carl, played by Tom Hanks. Carl almost gets Frank but he gets away the first time they meet.\nThen he cons as a doctor to throw the FBI off and then a lawyer. You probably know from the opening Frank will get caught eventually. Thought after he gets back to America the ending is actually pretty good and satisfying. I think this movie also started to create the 60's craze until Mad Men perfected it a bit later.\nAnyway this movie is pretty good as a biopic about Frank's coning and struggle to get back his fortune.",

Although I did not love it or like it as much as other films made by this master of filmmaking, I cannot deny how great and impeccable it was in nearly every department. As far as the performances is concerned, Hanks, DiCaprio and Walken were excellent.\n\nI cannot wait to watch it again because it has been like 6 years more or less since the only time I saw it.",

One's eyes are still drawn to groups of airline personnel walking through the corridors of airports around the world, but they usually lack the glamour associated with those depicted in the film.  This isn't always entirely the case.  There are more than a few Asian airlines in places like Seoul, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Bangkok, etc with some pretty impressive cadre.  Virgin in England isn't too shabby either.  For the most part the charm is gone though.  The rest of the film is pretty amazing as well though, from the forging to the law practice to the medical practice.  DiCaprio and Hanks are both on top of their game.

            "content": "\"Catch Me if you Can\" is a story that's so crazy it has to be true and would work even if it was completely fictional. Leonardo Dicaprio is terrific as Frank Abagnale and convincingly plays the man from a teenager to well into his twenties. This might not sound impressive but to convey a change in age it's much easier to go with big changes (a man in his thirties to an old man for example) than to go with subtle tones in voice, posture and mannerisms. Dicaprio is completely convincing as a young man who starts off completely lost and at first wandering the world aimlessly but quickly becomes an expert con artist. Tom Hanks is also fantastic as Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent that is hell-bent on capturing Frank. He seems like a simple character at first, happily doing a job that most of his peers don't respect and acting like such a straight arrow that you don't think he has much personality but as the film progresses you really get to know him and genuinely like the guy. That means you have two people you find yourself cheering for and each of them takes, at times the role of protagonist and antagonist. It's always keeping you on your toes trying to figure out who is going to get the upper hand and how they're going to do it.\n\nChristopher Walken also has a memorable role in the film as Frank's father (Frank Abagnale Sr.) and he does an excellent job adding some real humanity to the film with his father-son relationship as well as giving us a little hint as to how the character Frank got into his swindling ways. When it comes to the cons that Frank pulls of, the word \"unbelievable\" comes to mind, but director Steven Spielberg, armed with a great screenplay by Jeff Nathanson makes every trick convincing. You really believe that what you see on the screen happened because you can tell that the people that did these actions thought on their feet and acted quickly. There are many terrific moments that will really have you cheering but writing them down would spoil the surprises in the film. It's thoroughly satisfying to see Frank outsmart the authorities and keep getting away because you admire the guy. Anyone who has the guts to attempt to pass off as a pilot, purely to get free flights and paychecks out of it earns your admiration (even though you know what he's doing is wrong).\n\n\"Catch Me if you Can\" works as a great period piece, a thrilling game of cat-and-mouse, a thriller with some great twists and a film about some really unlikely deep relationships, be they between men and women , a father and his son or two adversaries who's lives are linked together. It really puts you at odds knowing that this is a true story because on the one hand you want to know the whole story but on the other, the film is so well done that you don't want to take the chance that your favorite part of the film won't be the complete truth. It's a real triumph and you'll have a terrific time watching the film. (Dvd, May 10, 2013)",

            "content": "It's certainly been a while since I've seen a film so easy to like and purely entertaining as Catch Me If You Can.  Fun and well paced, though not lacking in intelligence, Catch Me If You Can is ideal film.  It doesn't reach the masterpiece status many proclaim it has, but it's a confident and enjoyable ride, that even boasts some surprising emotional depth.\n\nInspired by actual events, Catch Me If You Can follows the story of Frank Abagnale Jr., who runs away after his parent's divorce at the age of 16.  Following in his dad's footsteps, Frank becomes a masterful conman, stealing millions of dollars.  However, Carl Hanratty, an FBI agent, is hot on Frank's heels.  As Frank continues to successfully evade the law, he also faces difficulties of his own, such as old wounds from his parent's divorce.\n\nWhile not as fast paced as one might expect from such a film, Catch Me If You Can never feels long or boring, despite the lengthy run time; nearly two and a half hours.  The film's consistent cleverness, and intriguing plot keeps the audience completely captivated for the entire duration.\n\nThe film works as a number of things.  It makes for an excellent comedy.  Frank Abagnale Jr. is fiendishly clever, and gets into some interesting (and humorous) situations by faking his identity.  Catch Me If You Can also works as an action film, due to it's \"chase\" premise.\n\nPerhaps most surprisingly, Catch Me If You Can also works as a drama.  While providing breezy fun, this is also a surprisingly touching film.  All of Frank's schemes and cons are done to make his father proud.  For despite the devastating divorce, Frank really loves his dad, and this adds an emotional element of the film.  Catch Me If You Can would've been a pleasant and enjoyable film without this element.  But this extra layer makes Catch Me If You Can memorable, and helps separate it from the dozens of other similar films out there today.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is excellent in the leading role as Frank Abagnale Jr.  His love for his father, and his easy confidence makes him a surprisingly likable character.  Tom Hanks as the persistent FBI Agent, Carl Hanratty is also well done (the amusing Brooklyn accent helps).  In a role that's similar to DiCaprio's, Christopher Walken portrays Frank's loving father, who's also a bit of a conman himself.  Walken's performance really boosts the emotional umph in this film, making his role the standout in the film.\n\nJohn William's score is very playful, and is also delightfully jazzy.  The child-like main theme and heavy use of the saxophone are memorable staples of the score.  The music truly enhances the film, and makes up one of William's most underrated scores.\n\nCatch Me If You Can isn't your average action flick.  It's emotional depth and intelligence distinguishes it from others of it's kin, while it's cleverness and humor ensures that it's a fun ride for all.  While there are brief moments of genius, Catch Me If You Can isn't a masterpiece, or even close.  But it's extremely memorable, and well made, and a lot different than most films of the same nature.",

            "content": "Catch me if you can is a film where everything is perfect. Great soundtrack, superb cast and a compelling storyline and what makes it even more belivable is that the film is based on a true story.\na well documented film by Steven Spielberg with Leonardo Dicaprio as Frank William Abagnale jnr, Tom Hanks as Carl Hanrady and Christopher Walken as Frank Senior. The film structure is Episodic meaning that the film has flashes into the future, this is a great effect from Spielberg as it links together at the end of the film and creates a couple of high suspense points.\nThe film is in the 1960's just as the real thing, the art and locations put into this film are well detailed and portrayed in this film from the right clothing to the right cars and transport, also the lighting and camera shots are well done in this film.\nChristopher Walken plays an Excellent performance, he's a lady killer. A swarve and sophisticated person and thus rubs onto his son Frank junior who uses these techniques in diffrent situations. Frank senior is such a memorable character becaus of his great phrases and sayings.\nthe film quickly changes from the success and big house to the downfall which is effectivly done with the transition. The spotlight also shifts from Frank Senior to Frank Junior.\nWhen Frank changed his first cheques he pursaveres even if some banks did not accept the cheques. Frank is very mature for his age and always looking for ways and schemes to get back the money his mom and dad lost.\nTo represent how young Frank is there is a scene in a phone booth where he is wearing teenage kind of clothing for that era with a patterned t-shirt and brown jacket but the camera angle of what this scene was took is from outside so we can see the fast paced world outside, showing adults in black suits moving very quickly. This carries on to the next scene where one of the staff at an airline suit fitter says ' you look too young to be an airline pilot' which a lot of people would be thinking he got away with a lot without much questioning, so adding little thigs like this can keep the audience belifs as real as this storyline can possibly get.\nthe film represents sterotypes really well in this film an example of this is when Frank becomes an airine Pilot Frank finds it a lot easier to to cash his cheques and it gives him a higher status in society as the public look at him more, in the 1960's Pilots were considerbale respected in society therfore Frank took advantage of the endless oppurtunitys with this power.\nThe FBI seemed to know very little on cheque fraud and Carl was the only one who seemed really intrested in catching Frank and the job in general. I find it quite bizare ho they did not realize that Frank was basically robbing the bank without the use of weapons or violence, infact they were handing him the cash.\nFrank is very comfortable in hostile situation and handles them very well, especially when Frank pretends to be secret service and his in the same room as Carl, he totally outwitties Carl who had no idea until he opens his wallet.\nUnaware of Franks consequences he still decides to marry hoping to settle down, but tis is not possible as Frank has commited huge crimes. Frank is aware that Carl is following his tracks and quickly decides to become a lawyer . To some this may seem very unreal how Frank seemed to get away with all of this but what Frank does is take advantage of the system and it gives him the oppurtunitys to do these things but Frank actually learned a fundemental basic knowldge of what careers he was choosing.\nWhat i love about this film is the importance of Family and the Christmas theme. There are strong family morales and the importance of love. Christmas is always a symbol in this film, the first with his mother and father where they was happy, and the others where he would call Carl to stop chasing him realising more and more that his mother and father wont get back together.\nIn a nutshell i can relate to Frank as he is the same age as me when he did all of this and i admire the way he carrys himself and the high level of sophistication Frank has. Because Frank is so intelligent and has a good knowledge in Cheques he actually ends up working with Carl and they have remained close friends to this day.",

            "content": "After seeing many of his movies, I've found that it's impossible for Steven Spielberg to make a film that isn't terrific.  While \"Catch Me If You Can\" isn't necessarily his best movies, it's still excellent, showcasing the filmmaker's talent to act as a chameleon in nearly every genre while also cementing Leonardo DiCaprio's status as one of the best actors of our generation.\n\tFrank Abagnale Jr. (DiCaprio) is a normal American teenager-- he's smart, talented, and has two loving parents (Christopher Walken, Nathalie Baye).  After his dad lands a new job, the family moves to a new city.  On his first day of school, Frank decides it would be fun and interesting to pose as the substitute teacher; and he gets away with it.  Realizing he has a knack for \"tricking\" people, Frank gets away with posing as an airline pilot, a banker, a doctor, and more, all the while forging checks.  While most of these adventures are successful, it has a negative effect on his family life, and he can't seem to settle down when he wants.  And FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is constantly hot on his tail.\n\t\"Catch Me If You Can\" is a good example of just how deliciously interesting a biographical film can be; luckily, with Spielberg's knack for style and wit, the film itself is breezy and enjoyable.  While it may be good for a standard 90-minute movie, it runs a little bit long at two-and-a-half hours.  Nevertheless, this film is much better than most, so any flaw it has is almost a treat, because it's a likable flaw.\n\tWhile it may not ever be too deep, \"Catch Me If You Can\" acts as a good vehicle for DiCaprio, who is so perfect that he overshadows every single one of his actors.  Almost thirty, with a resume already filled with impressive films, DiCaprio reflects the character he plays in some way, both talented wunderkinds that amaze us with every move they make.  The more impressive one in my opinion, is the actor himself.  To play such a immoral character, all the while making him charming and likable is difficult, but he pulls it off with ease, yet again proving to the world why he's an actor that's forced to be reckoned with.  Even more impressive is that he plays a teenager, without any stereotypical behavior.  Hanks, Walken, Baye, and Adams are all great actors, but they seem like shadows in comparison.\n\t\"Catch Me If You Can\" only has one flaw-- and that's its running time.  Other than that, this is a light, entertaining film that succeeds in making the viewer interested, and creating a warm, sweet atmosphere.",

This Spielberg's movie is fantastic, it's smart, it's very well-acted and it's tottally interesting, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has a 7.8 on IMDb, wich I think is okay, but if I was charge of giving movie's rates on IMDb, I would might give this movie a 9 or a 9.5 out of 1o. This movie's very worth to watch, it's funny, dramatic and it has a very interesting development, if someone didn't like it, catch that person if I can, I will defenitly catch that person and make it watch the movie several times until it realises that this movie is actually amazing. One of the best movies I have ever seen. Fantastic.\n\nSteven Spielberg directs this movie pretty well, he's one of my favorite directors and in here, he directed a movie that is diferent from (almost) all of his other movies, but it doesn't mean it's bad, he just seems that he can't direct a bad movie, any genre, any time, any perfection, he directed this movie really well, he never disapoints me. Leonard DiCaprio takes the lead role, I think he should deserve some more credits, he wasn't nominated for Oscar, but that's okay, I guess everyone did notice that he was fantastic at his role, I loved his character and perfomance, both amazing, one of the best movies of his career, Leonardo is known from on of my ten favorites movies, wich is Inception, he is also known from Shuter Island, Titanic, The Departed, J. Edgar and some other movies. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and in this movie, he just gives me another reason to think that, this wasn't the highlight of his career, he didn't had a remarcable character, but I still liked to see him in here, he had a really good perfomance and I enjoyed his character, this wasn't his best role, but yes it was one of his best roles, Tom is known from Larry Crown, Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump, The Terminal and some other movies. Christopher Walken takes a supporting role well, he deserved the Oscar nomination, but I wasn't seeing that coming, he was really good here, despite his not long screen time and I really enjoyed his character and perfomance, Christopher is known from Pulp Fiction, The Deer Hunter, Balls of Fury, Click and some other movies. Sow, as you can see, this movie's cast is fantastic, there's just great actors and great perfomances. Fantastic cast.\n\nA true story about Frank Abagnale Jr. who, before his 19th birthday, successfully conned millions of dollars worth of checks as a Pan Am pilot, doctor, and legal prosecutor.(What I thought about the plot) I loved the plot, it's not that heavy, it's really interesting and it worked here, the plot was really very good, I can't think of any bad thing about it. Truly amazing plot.\n\nSoundtrack, well, this movie's score was nominated for Oscar, did I enjoyed to hear it while I was watching the movie? Yes, but I didn't love it, but the soundtrack doesn't matter at all, the soundtrack didn't change 0,01% of my opinion about this movie's opinion, but still, this movie has a great soundtrack.\n\nBesides all that, I am now going to tell you what I really thought about this movie. First of all, before I watched Catch Me If You Can, I've seen the movie's poster like twise, but I didn't know a thing about it. I decided to give it a try (I basicly didn't had anything to watch) and I knew I was going to watch a nice movie, the IMDb's 7.8 explains it all, I loved the movie, and a great thing about it is that, when you watch a great movie, for example, if you watch your favourite movie for the first time or for the second, you want the movie to be long so you can have a longer expirience of a great movie, well, if you love this movie, you're very lucky, you must know what I'm talking about, this movie has a 2 hour lenght and I'm glad for it, I love when I watch a fantastic movie and the movie it's actually long. For who didn't like the movie, well, let me tell you a joke, Knock, knock... Just kidding. Overall, I tottally recommend you to se this movie, it's an amazing thriller(?), comedy(?), romance(?), drama(?), that's right, I don't know what genre to call this movie, I mean, I know, this movie is like a throdramedy, it envolves all sorts of genres in one unic movie, that worked really well, this is a marc of movies, it has all the elements of a great movie and it also has all the genres you want, I just loved everything about this movie and Steven just shows again that nno matter how hard he tries, he can't direct a bad movie, sow, this movie is amazing, it has a fantastic cast, a fantastic story, a great soundtrack and it's tottally entertaining, it's smart and it's fun, one of the best movies I have ever seen, watch it right now if you didn't, cause you're missing a great movie, like I was for 9 or 10 years. Terrific.\n\nTerrific movie. Very recommended movie. Grade: A.",

I found both of the leads to be likable in different ways and I really didn't know who to root for because I saw where they were coming from. All of the supporting performances are great too and there isn't a weak link in sight. The movie has a unique style to it and that's partially due to the unique and enjoyable score. I do feel that at times it becomes just a little bit repetitive but I certainly was never bored by it. It's a fun chase movie that ultimately ends up being really interesting and compelling.",

I loved the photography! It was so colorful and reflective of the beauty and brightness of many escapist dramas and thrillers of the 60s and 70s. The set decoration and art direction are astounding. The film's progression and overall development are so unique.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio deserves more recognition for this role. His shifts in personality are impressive and natural. Tom Hanks performs so well as the almost anti-social fatherly figure with strong depth. Christopher Walken's first down-to-earth role in a long time. He has a knack for giving positive elements to otherwise stupid films but in this film he certainly contributed but it didn't feel like as much because he didn't have to work as hard, I didn't think anyway.\n\nA fun, deep, thrilling masterpiece of sight and sound that won't soon be forgotten.",

            "content": "It's one of those stories where if someone forgot to tell you that it was based on a true story, you'd never believe it. Dicaprio, Hanks, and Walken perform excellently and Spielberg's stellar directing help set the mood for their spectacular performances. The narrative is also well crafted and themes of emotional turmoil due to an unstable family situation shine. You feel the pleasures the characters feel when they accomplish a seeming impossible task and you feel their anguish when they witness everything they ever cared for fall apart right before their very eyes.",
