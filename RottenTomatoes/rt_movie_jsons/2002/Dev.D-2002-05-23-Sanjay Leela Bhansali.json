He plans to marry Paro (Aishwarya Rai), his childhood best friend, but his parents (Vijay Crishna, Smita Jaykar) do not want Devdas to marry her.

An upper-class fairytale with luxurious ornate costumes, magnificent sprawling sets, complex choreography with a cast of a hundred dancers, and exquisite classical-influenced Indian music, with singing by the very young and precocious super-talent of Shreya Goshal; first made me cry without understanding a word sung!  Any paused frame could be a painting. With the most beautiful actress in the world, Aishwarya Rai, and the most electrifying male actor ever, Sha Rukh Khan - at once boyish, powerful, and amusing with permanently snarling eyebrows, a perfected downward smile, and super-actractive lips, acknowledged even by heterosexuals.  Watched it about six times, and still need to hide tears. Too tragic.  (Spoiler alert - great lines from the prostitute taking down the aristocrat who sought to destroy her publically!)",

            "content": "Devdas is a 2002 Hindi film based on Sharat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel of the same name. The film is set in the early 1900s and centers around two childhood friends and neighbors, Devdas (played by Shah Rukh Khan) and Paro (played by Aishwarya Rai). Devdas has just returned from studying abroad to become a lawyer and upon his return, discovers that his childhood love for Paro is still alive and mutual. However, conflict erupts between Devdas and Paro's families at the prospect of marriage due their class difference. Paro is quickly married to a man much older than her and much wealthier than Devdas' family. Meanwhile, Devdas, in his despair, flees his home to live in a brothel where one of the courtesans, Chandramukhi, falls in love with him. \n\tDevdas is a tragic romance told in a beautiful setting. The film features stunning visuals, incredible songs and choreography, and a gripping plot. From the beginning, Devdas and Paro's relationship is condemned, disrupting the moral universe of the film. As Rosie Thomas says, \"It is a predictably uncomfortable moment of Hindi cinema: the moral universe is grossly violated and the disorder is apparently unresolvable\" (Thomas 157). In this case, this moment of discomfort is extended throughout the film. Even though there are clear romantic feelings between Devdas and Paro, the universe has been disrupted in such a way that their true love can never come to fruition. Devdas reminds me, in that way, of Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak because both movie plots are driven by a strong, mutual love that cannot exist within the confines of the movie. This tragic, condemned romance is both my favorite and least favorite aspect of the movie, as the viewer knows that Devdas and Paro will never be able to come together but will still spend the entire movie wishing that they could.",

            "content": "The Sanjay Leela Bhansali classic, Devdas, is a romantic drama based on Sarat Chandra Chattopadhye's novel, Devdas. The movie begins with Devdas (Shah Rukh Khan), the son of a wealthy landowner, returning home from London after ten years. The conflict begins when Devdas decides to see Parvati alias Paro (Aishwarya Rai) before vising his family, where we first see Kaushalya's (Devdas' mother) disapproval of his love for Paro. The feud between their families is fueled by Kaushalya's agonizing rejection of Sumitra (Paro's mother) as she initiates the possible marriage of the two star-crossed lovers. Due to continued family conflict, Paro is then married into another wealthy family and Devdas resorts to alcoholism for relief. In this process he meets Chandramukhi (Madhuri Dixit), a courtesan, who falls deeply in love with him. A series of ill-fated events follow that ultimately lead to an unconventional end. \nThe extravagant portrayal of this love triangle is supported by the flamboyant costumes, larger than life sets and overly dramatic shots which in turn deliver an array of deep emotions to the audience. According to me, this movie provides a physical representation of the intensity of emotions felt by the characters. Dola re, for example, represents Paro's happiness, as she found someone who will unconditionally love Devdas and Chandramukhi's joy, arising from being accepted by the woman Devdas loves. Much like Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, this is an alternate Bollywood representation of inherited hatred, as it defies the usual structure we have seen; in which ultimately the moral universe reconciles. Though their plotline is partially similar in terms of portraying class difference as a disruption to the moral universe, Bhansali uses a much more traditional and grim approach. I think both Karan Johar in K3G and Bhansali in Devdas use filming techniques such as large and small mise-en-scene along with over the top sets and costumes to portray the intensity of emotion and the power it has over you, especially love, in an obviously unrealistic way simply aiming to satisfy the audience. They both give you Bollywood and then more Bollywood. However, I feel it would have been more interesting if we saw some kind of resolution for Paro's character too. The end of her story seemed abrupt as we were equally drawn into her struggles as much as Devdas'. Regardless, as abridged by Sangita Gopal, I think Bhansali like Johar \"boast[s] big budgets, gorgeous production values and carry cheesy subtitles\" to create magnificent successes.",

            "content": "Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 2002 romantic tragedy Devdas is a tale of love stories that remain unrealized because of boundaries placed by societal institutions of marriage, family, class differences, and status, in combination with personal flaws of all the lovers. Childhood sweethearts Devdas (Shahrukh Khan) and Paro (Aishwarya Rai) meet after years of being apart, and are still deeply in love with each other. Conflicts between the families over differences in class prevent prospects of their marriage and result in Dev leaving his house, and Paro married to an older man. Dev isolates himself and becomes an alcoholic, living at a brothel where one of the courtesans, Chandramukhi (Madhuri Dixit), falls for him. He is unable to reciprocate this love as he continues to yearn for Paro. After a fatal drinking episode, a dying Dev arrives at Paro's doorstep, but she is prevented from seeing him in his last moments by her husband. Full of such dramatic events and a heart-wrenching ending, this movie is complete with a star-studded cast, grand sets, beautiful costumes, and elaborate choreography to soulful songs that serve to give it an epic quality that effectively captures the audience into its own world. \nInstead of being realistic or depicting how ideal love should be, this movie arguably works to show how it should not be and that certain traits of lovers are very flawed, like passion, impulsiveness, being blind in love etc. This is one of the ways that Bollywood tackles romance and marriage, as explored by Rachel Dwyer in Yeh Shaadi Nahin Ho Sakti!: Romance and Marriage in Contemporary Hindi Cinema. Additionally, her point about \"non-modern\" vs \"modern\" views of marriage, where the former centers it on the wider family while the latter sees it as concerning personal happiness, explains the generational difference between Dev/Paro, and their families. This Bollywood formula of families being against real love because of societal standards is similar to movies like Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak and Veer Zara. Whether it be opposition due to past feuds or due to religious differences respectively, the families expect their children to inherit their hatred but they rise beyond that. Most importantly, they actively work to fight for their love, and the moral universe is restored because the lovers end up together in their own ways in a strong statement against hate. This contrasts with Dev as he lacks this trait of being able to \"negotiate a space for himself and his love within the family\" that Dwyer considers as a defining quality for a romantic hero. He realizes the need to fight for his love too late, and so the moral universe is never restored, upsetting the audience rooting for a successful love story. One criticism I would have is that by the end, because of the way events are presented, we feel most sympathy for dying Dev and forget about the fact that the two women have to continue living with their punishments for loving him: lack of liberty for Paro and lack of respect for Chandramukhi. However, overall, the aesthetics of the movie and the actors perfectly capturing the characters they play successfully make the audience invested in the story, and make it a classic Bollywood romance.",

Devdas is the wealthy son of a landlord, mischievous but ambitious, whose attraction to his neighbor Paro meets with opposition from his father. Paro\u00e2(TM)s family also opposes her interest in Devdas and the two go their separate ways, with Paro marrying a wealthy though cold widower with several children already. Devdas can\u00e2(TM)t get over his loss and turns to alcohol and the company of a sweet courtesan who falls in love with him.\n\nThe gorgeous sets of massive and antique South Asian households give the film a timeless quality and the dialogue is sharp, witty, allusive and poetic. The characters banter, scheme, long and rejoice in a manner of speaking which is slightly archaic and formal, conveying the idea that these characters and themes are immortal and timeless. The film packs comedy, romance, tragedy and a great many dance numbers into its almost three hour running time but it never drags or sags because it works on every level, the visual, the emotional and the narrative.",

Here is a story that circulates the various intertwining components: Self-sacrifice. Denial. Misery and anguish. Paro (Parvati) and Devdas have always been the best of friends, despite being from different caste. Inseparable from childhood, the two have a deep form of love that survives the ten years Devdas had been sent away to London. Paro, knowing that he would return one day, has always kept a candle lit each and every day. On his return, they hoped to cement their love and marry. A jealous sister-in-law, and a bitter mother separates the two indefinitely by embarrassing Paro's mother and her family at a formal celebration. Paro's mother decides to marry her daughter to a wealthier family which further deepens the separation. Devdas refusing to obey the wishes of his family, is cast out and leaves Paro behind. Forsaking their love in a letter, Paro decides to obey her mother?s wishes and marries. Realizing his great mistake, Devdas hurries home to find that Paro is about to marry and tries to convince her to break off her engagement. Insisting it is too late, Paro marries and moves off to the home of her new family. Devdas leaves, and with the help of an old college friend, begins to drink heavily to forget Paro. After a near-death experience, Devdas is saved by a beautiful courtesan named Chandramukhi. She is initially entranced by Devdas, and empathizes with his despair. Willfully patient, Chandramukhi continues to help Devdas. Knowing that Paro and Devdas still love each other deeply, Chandramukhi continues to hope that one day Devdas could return her love. Amazingly beautiful music! Remarkable dance sequences. Great cast- Aishwarya Rai, Shahrukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit, Kiron Kher, and Jackie Shroff. Worth seeing! evdas happens to one of the most expensive movies ever made in India. And it paid off. This movie was just drop dead gorgeous. The acting was fantastic. And generally, I like only 1 or 2 songs from a Bollywood movie, but I bought the soundtrack movie for this one because I enjoyed the dance numbers so much. This film fleshed out what was a small story and had been done before. Yes, it's extravagant, yes it's obvious it's dripping in money, and yes, it's still a lengthy, typical Bollywood movie. But it's more serious and poetic, and the result is a stunning film with timeless love story. Sanjay Leela Bhansali had hoped this film would garner a foreign Oscar, and though it didn't, it did at least have the partial makings for one. Absolutely wonderful, emotionally charged but, a tragic ending to a love story! It shows the ugly side of a cast system still below the surface of society! But love has not cast, religion or color! There's more to Devdas than extravagance; the emotion and passion of the story is felt just as strongly in every frame as the budget.",

I haven't seen the 1955 Version starring DILIP KUMAR and SUCHITRA SEN But according to sources, this Bimal Roy's adaptation is still refered as the best adaptation because it was faithful to the basic concepts of novel with magnificient performance from all the three cast. Sadly, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's new remake is a sore disappointment\n1.) It is not at all faithful to the novel.\n2.) Performance is completely let down barring few actors.\n\nThese points are absolute opposite to the 1955 version, The film looks stylish with eye-watering cinematography of ANIL MEHTA, Costumes are electrifying particularly from the actresses. But the story is half-convincing. The major flip-side as I mentioned before is that it isn't faithful to the words of novel, Here Paru & Chandramukhi are made to meet and dance Dola Re Dola (brilliant choreography, sadly looks forced) But the truth is that PARU & CHANDRAMUKHI NEVER MET ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, this modification changes the course of screenplay completely. The emotions are contrived, you don't feel sympathy for Devdas and Paru when they part ways. The film is very predictable, there the film falters at high. ISMAIL DARBAR'S songs are melodious. \n                Now Performance wise, Firstly Special mention should be given to the exceptional  MADHURI DIXIT, for playing the role of CHANDRAMUKHI effortlessly. She looks bewitching throughout, her mesmeric dance in DOLA RE DOLA truly outshines ASH. AISHWARIYA RAI inturn  delivers an earnest act as PARU, she is a complete revelation. Unfortunately, same thing cannot be said for SHAH RUKH KHAN, he  excels in couple of scenes but overall  he is restrained and doesn't register any impact as the heart-broken alcoholic devdas. OVERALL ,Devdas is high in style quotient but falls short in story. Disappointing!!!!",

It also has the distinction of being number 83 on my 100 Greatest List. \r\nLike all Bollywood films Devdas is a musical. It tells the story of a Bengal man who returns home from London to marry his childhood sweetheart Paro. Devdas is met with opposition from his father to this match. Out of spite to Devdas' parents Paro is married to a rich man, and Devdas begins his downward spiral.\r\nThe film combines great acting with outstanding technical work, and an amazing score. Shahrukh Khan gives a wonderful performance as Devdas. Aishwarya Rai (Bride & Prejudice) plays Devdas' childhood sweetheart Paro, with Madhuri Dixit as Chandramukhi, the courtesan who attempts to save Devdas from himself. The technical elements are also top notch. Cinematographer Binod Pradhan completely delivers on his end with lush shots. This is one of the most beautiful and vibrant films ever shot. \r\n\r\nBottom Line: **** If you can get your hands on a copy of Devdas do so. You won't regret buying this rich, beautiful, and epic musical which has its own distinct flavor.",

Sanjay Leela Bhansali gets so lost in the beauty of it all that he somehow forgets to tell the story of Devdas in a unique way, dissappointing his fans as normally, his work is filmmaking personified. \r\nThe film just drags on and on, not only causing people to droop sloppily in their seats - but by the time Dev dies, no one can remember what happened before or how the film began. A period drama like Devdas ought to be made in such a way that one remembers every minute of it and by the time one walks out of the screen, all they can remember is the Dola Re song. \r\nAishwarya and Shah Rukh stand out as performers whereas Madhuri does a fine job as the prostitute/14th century table dancer. Overall Devdas is a film which can only be remembered for its visuals, not for the long-lost romance of Dev and Paro.",

Gives Shahrukh a chance to really showcase both of his talents: playful comedy and heartbreaking drama.  \"Silsila Ye Chaahat Ka\" is exceptional.  Overall, a more stylized and exotic Bolly, with a heartwrenching ending.  A fantastic experience.",
