    "summary": "\"Nine Queens\" is the story of two small-time swindlers, Juan (Gast\u00f3n Pauls) and Marcos (Ricardo Dar\u00edn), who team up after meeting in a convenience store and become involved in a half million-dollar deal. As the deceptions and duplicity mount, it becomes more and more difficult to figure out who is conning whom, and we begin to ask ourselves, \"Who isn't a thief?\"",

Lots of unnecessary swearing though.  It was an STG DVD.",

            "content": "\"The more offended you are, the less suspicious you look. If things get tough, you accuse the rest of them.\"\nMarcos, forget the street hustles, and get into politics. \n\nThe thing with heist movies (and while this is more of a 'con artist' plot, it's got the same feel) is that they all share the same critical, predictable feature - an inevitable reveal that it was \"planned all along\". Speaking from the perspective of plot alone, scam flicks have a predictability to their ending to rival midcentury Disney animated movies. What you're left to enjoy are the details that lead up to that inevitable conclusion, and there are plenty to enjoy in Nine Queens: Ricardo Dar\u00edn as Marcos, who straddles the line between suave and disgusting, the dark comedy bits, and character interactions that are among the best the genre has to offer. One of the film's greatest successes is building an atmosphere among thieves that suggests professional courtesy while remaining on edge due to their inclination to get the better of one another. Enjoyable, but it's aged better in the small moments than the big swings. (3/5)",

Set against background of an Argentinian economic crisis, along with some subtle and blunt metaphor in relation to that. My main problem about the story and it's twist, is how stretched the suspension of disbelief becomes if you really think about it. Because anticipating person's actions and reactions to such precise extent and moving variables would make John Kramer blush. The con is less effective, when it relies on omnipotence.",

            "content": "I am really fascinated by movies about con artists and their elaborate plans to get money out of people. As long as they are likable people, it makes for such a fun plot and also has built-in drama because you\u0092re always worried they\u0092ll be discovered. Part of the added enjoyment I had in Nine Queens was the fact that I was never confident about who was lying and who was telling the truth at any given moment. This made for a superb mystery that I loved. Ricardo Darin was great in the lead role, and he has a charisma that makes his performance more believable. I\u0092m not sure Gaston Pauls was quite as good, but he still did well contrasting as the novice kid who\u0092s learning from the veteran. I was surprised how little this movie felt like a foreign film to me. I\u0092m typically so annoyed by reading the subtitles and I don\u0092t enjoy the different feel of cinema from other countries. But all of that melted away in Nine Queens and I was simply loving the story. I swear, if this was made in the US with a couple big-name actors, it would have been massively successful. I\u0092m not sure all the logic works perfectly when you realize everything that happened, but I\u0092m also not sure whether that matters at all. The ending is strangely satisfying even though things don\u0092t turn out exactly as you hope. This is the type of movie that I would highly recommend to others, because it is so well-crafted and works on almost every level.",

Nine Queens which is listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. It's a well made, and twisted heist film, probably one of the best in newer times.\n\nNine Queens starts in a little convenience store in the early morning, a small-crime crook, Juan, successfully scams the cashier, but when tries it the second time with another cashier he's caught, but another crook, Marcos, gets him out the trouble and then ask if he want to go for the big score by selling a forgery of a postage stamp called Nine Queens. But that's easy said than done. I don't want to give away the ending, but I assure you. You will not be disappointed. My conclusion about Nine Queens is that it's a good movie, with a lot of lovable crooks and losers, with makes it sometimes pretty funny. Thumbs ups from me.",

As each man displays his talents, the younger man's distrust of his mentor mirror own own as his amoral philosophy reveals an even blacker heart.

So, walking in, I did not go in with an open mind. I did not think this one was gonna rock. Plus, I had seen many movies that came after, that used the template this one laid out ('Matchstick men', for instance). So, when my friend asked me (during the break) to guess what was going on, I was bang on target (as the finale proved), but that, in no way, detracted from the entire experience, which unfolded as a treat to behold, without the 'royal' flourishes of a Nolan (think 'Prestige', not 'Inception'), but just by being so subtle that you might miss the point (another friend, who loves movies of this genre, actually missed the point - was paying attention to his cell phone during that 1 crucial frame).",

The artsy crowd will gawk at the intense imagery and stunning sweeping shots. The Tarentino-ites will be pleased with the rapid-fire dialogue and fast paced action.\n\nEven younger viewers would find this movie engagingly funny and action packed at the same time.\n\n5748 thumbs up.",

Juan, a likeable novice con is taken under the wing of Marcos, the experienced but callous conman looking for a partner.  The plot moves through a series of cons and spins that ultimately lead up to the final revelation - a twist that is surprising but not very satisfying.  As a whole, Nine Queens is a very good (and at times special) film that never quite becomes great.\r\n\r\nI do find it very difficult to effectively critique a foreign film that has a lot of dialogue and complex plot development.  From not understanding the nuances of the language, to constantly having to rapidly look back and forth from the action on the screen to the subtitles...I will admit that I might have liked the movie a lot better than I rated it.  There are just too many things that I may have missed or misunderstood.  So go see it and enjoy, because it is still a really good film.",

Gandolfo happens to be staying at a luxury hotel where Marcos' estranged sister Valer\u00eda (Leticia Br\u00e9dice) is employed, and with whom Marcos is currently involved in a bitter legal dispute over an inheritance.  \n\nAfter successfully negotiating a price for the stamps, the straightforward plan begins going awry as third parties get involved and unexpected challenges arise.  Marcos and Juan find that things are not what they seem and no one is to be trusted as the adventure becomes more convoluted.  \n\nIs it every con man for himself or is it all just a big joke?\n\n[b]The Good[/b]:  The movie won several prominent awards at well-known festivals, such as the Biarritz International Festival of Latin America, the Bogota Film Festival, and the Lima Latin American Film Festival among others.\n\nDirector Fabian Bielinsky creates a smart, energetic crime movie that, whether intentional or not, also works as a commentary on Argentina's economic crisis which was taking place when the film was released.  The storyline is solid, and the unexpected plot twists are highly entertaining.  Leading men Gast\u00f3n Pauls and Fabian Dar\u00edn showcase very natural, believable performances and have great onscreen chemistry without a hint of superficial, pop-culture vanity.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]:  In 2004, this film was remade by American studios into a film called [i]Criminal[/i].  Although I haven't seen [i]Criminal[/i] and therefore will not criticize that film, Bielinsky's original is fine as it is and does not need to be remade.  \n\n[b]Who would like this movie[/b]: If you enjoyed heist/con/crime movies such as the 2001 version of [i]Ocean's Eleven, [/i]then [i]Nine Queens[/i] is right up your alley.  It's a film that you have to pay close attention to, and perhaps even view a second time.  Any fan of crime movies can get drawn into this adventure. \n\nThe urban background and slick plot-line could place this film in any big city, despite the fact that it was shot specifically in Buenos Aires.  It's a movie that doesn't have a \"foreign feel\" to it (other than the language) and the subject matter pretty much cuts across cultural lines.  All in all, it's a cool movie that succeeds without ever [i]trying[/i] to be cool.\n\nThanks for reading- you can find more of my reviews [url=\"http://www.foreign-films-for-you.com/foreign-action-movie.html\"]here...[/url]",

The story takes place over one or two days and so minor twists and turns become profound. This original version sets up the relationship between the seasoned grifter and the younger, greener, grifter beautifully and this is balanced with the right amount of underlying malevolence and really great comedic nuance. Beilinsky's support characters are truly memorable too. Superior in every way - you won't be disappointed",

However this is David Mamet territory, where buddies keep one eye on the target and the other on the buddy. \r\n\r\n   The film's pace is quick, like the hands of 3-card Monte; emotional involvement either on the screen or in the audience is minimal; everyone has a moment of triumph and defeat.

Bielinsky?s script cleverly layers multiple cons within cons within cons to drive the audience to question whom is actually pulling the wool over whose eyes. The con is the main focus of the film, but I was drawn to the interplay between Marcos and Juan. Marcos is selfish, sly and ruthless. Juan is kind, smart and has greater skills than are evident at first glance. The two men have little in common, but neither can do the job on their own and are tenuously bound by the desire for lots of money. Nine Queens plays the relationship for laughs, but knows how and when to push the right dramatic buttons.\n\n(transcripted)",

            "content": "[size=3]Well let me just begin by saying that I had no real desire to see this film, but when I began watching it on IFC, I was immediately swept away by the fast pacing, brilliant acting, and excellent direction from Fabian Bielinsky. The film closely resembles in my mind some of the greatest con-man movies in cinema: The Sting, The Grifters, etc... and this film is no prohibitor to the success of the growing legacy. [/size]\n\n[size=3]\"`Nueve reinas' or `Nine Queens,'a film made in Argentina on a shoestring, is one of the most elaborate and authentic grifter/con films ever made, and I don't know if I could explain it if I wanted to. In fact to explain it would be to ruin it for anyone who hasn't already seen it, because each successive grift is a surprise, and it's only after one has seen it that one wants very much to discuss just what it is that happened all through and above all what that final sequence means. It is the gift of `Nine Queens' to pile surprise on surprise on surprise until it seems that the grifters are the victims of their own grift at every stage of the long fascinating game. This is not a parable about cons but a literal con. It's the real thing. Stories about grifters or con artists, like, say, the excellent Stephen Frears movie, `The Grifters,' (1990), or the ingenious David Mamet movie, `The Spanish Prisoner' (1997). or Fred Schepisi's illuminating `Six Degrees of Separation' (1993), have some point to make, but the only point of a real con is that the con artist can never be trusted and his victims can always be fooled, and it's the essence of dealing with such people that you realize at some point that nothing they said was reliable, from the very first word. This is the way it is with `Nine Queens,' and that's what makes it such a classic movie and such an ultimate depiction of the world of the grifter. And so the movie becomes a kind of parable after all, because as Calder\u00f3n said, Life is a dream and a dream of a dream, and as I would like to point out for those who I hope will not find it too obvious, a filmmaker is a con artist too, because he sets out to make us believe that what he depicts is real, which it is not, and that his actors are the people they portray, which they are not. And so a con artist is a perfect role for an actor to play.\n \nPerhaps Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, the creator of `Nine Queens,' who's less famous than Mamet and Frears and Schepisi, is therefore more modest, and is therefore able to focus on the con within the con without making any point besides conning us through to the end of this ingenious story. The actors are not famous, but like any actors worth their salt they are convincing and charismatic enough to hold our attention and make us believe that they are doing what they say they are. The very simplicity of the production and modesty of the actors (not of their skills, which are excellent, but of their reputations, which are minor) aid in convincing us of the audience that the scenes we are watching are or could be quite real. The story begins when a younger man who has been conning the staff of a convenience store gets caught in his con, and an older man comes in successfully posing as a policeman and takes him away, thus freeing him from the clutches of the store manager and staff. Thus two con artists, Juan, the younger man, and Marcos, the older one, meet and form an alliance, in which Marcos enlists Juan's help in a scheme he has yet to explain.\n \nAt one point early on Marcos makes a phone call when Juan is out of earshot and he says only, `It's on.' What? Do we ever find out? What is clear from that moment, if not before, is that no alliance between con artists is a sharing of trust.\n \nThe ultimate lesson to be learned from `Nine Queens' is that no one is more gullible than a con man \u0096 that grifters, in order to con people, have to be able to believe in their own fabrications, and thereby they become potential victims of the grift. Eventually the two deceivers are led to a set of stamps of great value called `The Nine Queens,' which they set out to sell to a very rich man visiting from Spain called Gandolfo. Gandolfo seems almost ridiculously eager to purchase these items from these fellows who have no pedigree or legitimate provenance. But herein lies another truth, that greed \u0096 in this case the rich collector's greed to obtain a prize item by any means necessary \u0096 will lead men to take unreasonable risks. Everyone once a con is afoot is eager to make a profit, and both con artist and victim want to believe they have found a wonder at a bargain price.\n \nIt is essential to the value of the movie that we in the audience realize only at the end that the con is on us. \n \nNo story is more focused than this one. Like a picaresque tale it moves from moment to moment: each moment is a transformation, and must be watched with riveted attention because it will change what comes next. Such a simple and effective means of constructing a movie! Yet how rarely are such means put to such good use! `Nine Queens' has etched a small but permanent niche for itself in the history of cinema.\n \nThis is a mean and ugly world, which at the same time is utterly fascinating and compulsively watchable. Can people really be like this? Indeed they can. And the interest with which we watch it all happen shows that we are made of the same cloth.\" - Chris Knipp[/size]\n\n[size=3]:fresh: 3.5/4 stars[/size]",

Like all these types of films, it has funny tricks, witty dialouge, and of course, a jaw-dropping ending that I tried to guess before it happened, but I failed miserably.

They completely entrance you from the opening frame to the last, making you entirely forget that you're at your sitting on your living room floor. F.W. Murnau's [i]Nosferatu[/i] is one of those films. It's heavily Gothic cinematography and tone would make Edgar Allen Poe proud. It certainly worked for me, as the film's huge arches, shadowy figures, and driving music will forever be etched in my memory. Max Screck's performance is one of the creepiest I've ever seen.  I can't wait to hopefully see Herzog's version later this month. [/size][/font]",

It's the kind of movie that some people will watch and say 'if only they made movies like this in Hollywood'... which would be fine, except they make plenty of movies like this in Hollywood. Nine Queens is basically Confidence with subtitles and without Rachel Weisz. I really like the genre, so I was entertained, but also a little bit disappointed. It's certainly not in the same class as House of Games or The Grifters, the two masterpieces of the genre.\n    \n The movie is well acted, and put together competently. As most of these, it's plot driven - none of the characters are especially well constructed. There's a point in the movie where the only buyer they have for their fake stamps exercises his oligopsony*** power and starts making unreasonable demands. This is supposed to set up the big emotional payoff, but for some reason, it just didn't hit me that hard.\n    \n In any case, it's definitely worth a watch, especially if you like con movies.

The beginning is great. Hell, the opening montage itself is excellent. There is one scene in the film that is so brilliant it belongs in another, better film. The scene in question is a flashback of sorts to a black security guard stumbling onto the Watergate scandal, and then a man in a Richard Nixon mask shows up with various members of the scandal that went on to have great careers. It's a brilliant scene, brilliantly photographed, brilliantly written. Too bad it goes downhill from there. Actually, I never thought I would ever say this in my life, but when the lesbians show up, this film does a complete 180 into dumbass idiocy. There is no way Spike Lee directed the second half of this film. At least, that's what I hope. It gets so lazy and so stupid in the second half that you're tempted to think that Spike ran into a film school student at a Knicks game and let him finish the second half of the film, it's that bad. Great first half. God-awful second half.\n \n [b][i]NINE QUEENS [/i][/b]is an incredibly engrossing heist film from Argentina that I must say, fooled the shit out of me. It does have your typical double and triple and quadruple crosses, but the ending is genuinely surprising. A good little flick for fans of a good heist flick that doesn't try to go all Mamet on us and try so terribly hard to be clever. We all know my disdain for the Mamet.\n \n [i][b]THE INCREDIBLES[/b][/i]. Wow. That's really all that needs be said. Really.\n \n Hopefully, HOPEFULLY I'll get to see one of those first three films I mentioned this coming weekend. I do know one thing for certain. I'm going to see that masterpiece called [b][i]SIN CITY [/i][/b]again this weekend. Probably two more times. It's astounding how much I've masturbated all over that flick already, and it hasn't even officially come out yet. It's that fucking good, ya hosers.",

As expected, it features the requisite number of tricky twists and turns. As expected, the plot is dense and convoluted, and the characters are pawns that play and are played by the game of crime.\n \n[i]Nine Queens[/i], though, is more deep and polished and atmospheric than many of these crafty shell games. As played marvellously by Ricardo Dar\u00edn and Gast\u00f3n Pauls, respectively, Marcos - a quick-witted, 40-ish pro in the art of suggestion, who sports a goatee and a black tie - and Juan - a young, proud, baby-faced hustler who's new to the game, yet not inexperienced at it - come to life vividly and realistically. From the time they meet in a 7-11-ish convenience store up until they try to pawn of a forged set of valuable stamps (the Nine Queens of the title) for $450 000, these guys are really believable as devious, cunning, and also desperate and vulnerable con men - humans instead of mere ciphers.\n \nFabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, a first-time feature director, also infuses the film with gritty visual atmosphere. The movie has a squalid, urban-greed-hits-the-dirty-streets mood and an ambiance of made-in-Argentina authenticity that lends its cons a certain voyeuristic kick. [i]Nine Queens[/i], at its best, looks and feels real, whereas too many heist films are just proud to be unbelievable. \n \nThe plot here is the usual hard-to-follow assemblage of assorted intertwined twists. Everybody cons everybody else in this greedy world of lies and trickery. The lively, believable characters and authentic atmosphere of [i]Nine Queens[/i], however, make it a true jewel worth snatching. [b]B+[/b]",

If you haven't seen it yet, check it out.\r\n\r\nI got another job offer today, maybe I'll actually get to take this one. That is, if I can get my ID situation handled. Wonky Virginian DMV. I spent most of the day kicking various shapes of ass in video Games.:cool: Virtua Fighter, Soul calibur,Super Smash bro's, even wack ol Tekken 4. That game is outdated like zip drives.   I hate how the engine stutters between moves. There's no sense of speed, no flow. I doubt there will be a Tekken Five, but I know I'm wrong. Well, another boring day, another boring entry. I'm meeting some people for training tomorrow so maybe I'll be able to post about a new injury or two.\r\n\r\nGod bless this Fall Weather. And God bless Fashion photographers.  I adore the way they frame their shots. Oh, but God kill the airbrushing of models.[/color]\r\n\r\n[img]http://invis.free.anonymizer.com/http://www.celebwelove.com/Naomi_Campbell/nc02.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n*drool* regardless :rolleyes:",
